1
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,981
100,000. Shall we poke our nose
into space, Frank?

2
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,949
That's enough. We're approaching
heat barrier. Let's level off.

3
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,487
Recover One, this is Falcon.
Beginning descent now.

4
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,926
Roger, Daedalus.

5
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,961
Got you on the scope, Frank.

6
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,564
Miss October.

7
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,721
Bing. 1 10,000th floor,
ladies' lingerie.

8
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,498
You catch that, Hawk?

9
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:16,198
She's all right. She's just
talking to me, that's all.

10
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,830
You trust me, don't you?

11
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,071
We're taking her down.
That's an order.

12
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,037
Oh, here we go again.

13
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:25,904
Frank.

14
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,107
Look at that.

15
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,613
That's where we're going.

16
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,082
l don't know how
and l don't know when but....

17
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:42,929
Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars

18
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,960
Come on, baby.

19
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,441
You want to get out
and give us a push?

20
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,453
We got to eject!

21
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,425
At 1 12,000 feet?
Are you out of your mind?

22
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,563
No choice.
We're not riding this one out.

23
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,204
Call mayday!
We're popping! We're popping!

24
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,567
-l'm not losing another ship.
-Don't think about it.

25
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:29,867
Just do it!

26
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,711
l'll count down to one.
You ready? One.

27
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,859
Shit!

28
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,932
Crazy son of a bitch almost
landed like a bug on a windshield.

29
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,048
This is it!

30
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,685
First one down wins the prize!

31
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,400
1 12,000 feet and l feel fine!

32
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,241
You've always got to push things
to the limit.

33
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,707
That's what l do best, Frank.

34
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,784
Get off me!

35
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,218
Come on, you guys! Break it up!

36
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,359
Come on.

37
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,175
ls that smoke l smell?

38
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,802
Looks like a fire out by Ridgecrest.

39
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,816
We crashed the X-2.

40
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,751
My 4-million-dollar X-2?

41
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,116
ls that the X-2 you're referring to?

42
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,555
We did break both speed
and altitude records, sir.

43
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,622
And beat the free-fall mark
by 30,000 feet.

44
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,029
Three planes in ten months.
That's bound to be a record too.

45
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,976
The engine failed. The aircraft went
in a flat spin. We couldn't recover.

46
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,638
But you made it.

47
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,705
That's the important thing.

48
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,009
And you made it...

49
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,690
...just in time, Frank.

50
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,562
Ladies and gentlemen of the press...

51
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:40,700
...l'm Major Bob Gerson, United States
Air Force, and l hold in my hand...

52
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:45,564
...a directive from the president
of the United States of America.

53
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,867
lt reads:

54
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,135
"Effective immediately,
the Air Force's involvement...

55
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:54,211
...in outer atmosphere
testing and exploration...

56
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,212
...is hereby terminated.

57
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,349
A new civilian agency...

58
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,784
...the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, is this day chartered.

59
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,959
Project Daedalus is now complete...

60
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,457
...and designated
Mission Accomplished."

61
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,287
The Air Force is out?

62
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,097
What about the pilots?

63
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,733
Who is going to be
the first American in space?

64
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,837
A decision has been made.
After an exhaustive search...

65
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:23,637
...we've identified who can best
carry out a mission of this magnitude.

66
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,439
This job calls for toughness,
both mental and physical toughness...

67
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,106
...and in the tradition of
the best of the Air Force...

68
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,213
...an ability to follow orders
to the letter.

69
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,285
Ladies and gentlemen,
l'd like you to meet Mary-Ann...

70
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,552
...the first American
to cross into outer space.

71
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,710
Look, Frank.
She wants to shake your hand.

72
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,312
You bastard.

73
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,282
Shake her hand for the cameras, Frank.
That is an order.

74
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,477
lt just isn't responding.

75
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,984
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
mission director Sara Holland.

76
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,424
She's been monitoring
the situation closely...

77
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,599
...and she assures me
that the problem is well in hand.

78
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,032
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

79
00:08:56,236 --> 00:09:00,138
As you may know, 1 1 days ago,
atmospheric tracking determined...

80
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,968
...that Russian communications
satellite lkon...

81
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,838
...has initiated orbital degradation.

82
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,015
Computer trajectory models
predict a steady acceleration...

83
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,741
...in sequence with
the gravitational constant.

84
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:16,082
There's a systems failure in online
navigation and guidance avionics.

85
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,054
All redundant systems
are non-responsive.

86
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:23,752
Without active course correction
in the next 30 to 40 days...

87
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,660
...the satellite will reenter
the Earth's atmosphere.

88
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,425
And crash?

89
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,901
General.

90
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,000
lkon has served you for 14 years.

91
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,939
That is in the performance range
of a communications satellite.

92
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,740
lt will probably crash in the ocean
or burn up in the atmosphere.

93
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,807
l think it's best that we let it.

94
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:52,551
My country's grateful for the efforts
of NASA and the State Department.

95
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,195
However, losing lkon is not an option.

96
00:09:56,396 --> 00:10:00,833
lkon is not just a communications
satellite to the Russian Federation.

97
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,501
lkon is the communications satellite.

98
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,872
You are undoubtedly aware
of our restructuring programs.

99
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,600
Losing all telecommunications...

100
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:16,476
...until we're able to replace lkon
could plunge us into chaos.

101
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,607
And perhaps...

102
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,850
...even civil war.

103
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,688
Hard to believe you fellas
only have one bird up there.

104
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,465
Couldn't we just
transfer the workload?

105
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,802
Gene. Excuse me, Sara.

106
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,634
We have a presidential mandate
to assist the Russians...

107
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,176
...our partners in
the lnternational Space Station.

108
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,676
And l assure you
that we will fix this problem.

109
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,311
lt's just a glitch.

110
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,948
You are feeding these guys
bold-faced lies.

111
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,519
lt's a waste of money
and my staff's time.

112
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,952
Sara, you're one hell
of an engineer...

113
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,718
...but you don't know jack-shit
about politics.

114
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,895
Helping the Russians save face
is an act of good faith.

115
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,997
How can you put a price on that?

116
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,135
This thing is dumb as a post.
lt's dead in the air.

117
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,742
Kid, why don't you stop trying
to talk to the satellite?

118
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,209
You have the code.
Override the guidance system.

119
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,980
You want to figure that mess out?

120
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,813
The guidance system on this thing
is a dinosaur.

121
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,547
Even these guys don't understand it.

122
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,021
lt's pre-microprocessor.
lt's pre-everything.

123
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,490
Whoever designed this
Byzantine piece of shit...

124
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,823
...is probably chopping rocks
in Siberia.

125
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,194
Ethan, can l access the Skylab files
from here?

126
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,862
What does that have
to do with anything?

127
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,040
A damn fine politician, but you don't
know jack-shit about engineering.

128
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,271
This is the guidance system
from Skylab.

129
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,242
That's not possible.

130
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:01,015
Maybe there's similarities,
but they can't be the same.

131
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,116
l'm looking up the designer.

132
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,454
Hell. Don't bother.

133
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,791
lt was Francis D. Corvin.

134
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,626
ls he dead?

135
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,498
Only if l'm lucky.

136
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:26,074
Would you like me to read
the instructions to you again?

137
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,316
Let me tell you something, my dear.

138
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:36,247
A fella in Japan wrote those
instructions when he made this thing.

139
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,050
They were probably translated
by some gringo...

140
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,751
...an expatriate American who
couldn't get a job in this country.

141
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,533
Then a Japanese guy probably
translated him to double-check on him.

142
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,961
We don't need these instructions.
Not at all.

143
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,703
Tear them up.

144
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,303
You know the door to the house
is locked, right?

145
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,779
Well, it's no problem.

146
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,480
-You forgot the batteries?
-Yeah.

147
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,183
l've got you here in the garage.

148
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,953
The smell of gasoline, of fertilizer.

149
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,789
What do you say, baby?

150
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,729
l'll push you up on this washer
and turn you a few cycles.

151
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,463
-l'll turn this washer on....
-Help! Oh, help!

152
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:29,108
l'm locked in the garage
with a dirty old man!

153
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,238
-Didn't we do this once 20 years ago?
-Yeah, l know.

154
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,722
Dr. Corvin?

155
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:53,722
Yes.

156
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,762
Excuse me, sir,
am l interrupting something?

157
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,238
-Yeah.
-Dr. Corvin, l'm Sara Holland...

158
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,433
...and this is astronaut Ethan Glance.

159
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,475
We're with NASA.

160
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,845
lt was in your car.
l heard someone scream.

161
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,746
Thanks for saving the day.
Now what is it you want?

162
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,719
Could we have
a minute of your time?

163
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:21,383
You should've called ahead of time.
l'm a very busy man.

164
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,359
Dr. Corvin, we're here because a
satellite with your guidance system...

165
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:30,764
...is about to reenter the atmosphere.
The system is non-responsive.

166
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,771
You want to take a crack at it?

167
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,307
There seems to be an interruption
in the path here.

168
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,711
But the circuitry still works.
lt's sending us data.

169
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,317
You're losing your uplink.

170
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,688
There has to be a problem
in the manual routing drive.

171
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,551
l don't think so.

172
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,989
That's the consensus
among the engineers.

173
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,719
Same engineers that sent you two here?

174
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,695
Sorry, does that bother you?

175
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,802
Yes, it does, actually.

176
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:09,499
Your design predates
all existing guidance systems.

177
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:14,475
lt was ahead of its time in '69
but this technology's obsolete now.

178
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,411
None of the current engineers
even speak the language...

179
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,279
...and the older guys are all...

180
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,585
-...are....
-Yeah.

181
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,885
lt wasn't designed for this
duration of duty, that's what.

182
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,084
lt was designed for the Skylab.

183
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,821
My advice is to capture it
and bring it home.

184
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,624
lt's too big.

185
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,802
For the space shuttle?
What kind of bird is it?

186
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:42,106
lt's a Russian
communications satellite.

187
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,976
What the hell's my guidance system
doing on a Russian satellite?

188
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,443
That's not our primary concern
at this time.

189
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,913
Where's it orbiting? Or is that
not your primary concern either?

190
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,021
1 ,000 miles.

191
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,616
Rate of decay?

192
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,191
8,000 meters per day and accelerating.

193
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:09,092
lt's coming home,
five weeks at the most, l got.

194
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,768
NASA's calculations agree.
But here we are.

195
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,101
Doctor, you designed this system.

196
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:20,370
lf anyone can solve this problem,
it's you.

197
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:29,321
For a minute there, l thought
you two might be Bob Gerson's lackeys.

198
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,116
But your knowledge...

199
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:35,351
...and your knowledge of history
seems to make that impossible.

200
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,297
Gerson's been taking credit
for my work since '58...

201
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,900
...when he replaced my ass
with a monkey.

202
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,605
You don't work for Gerson, do you?

203
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:54,540
He's a project manager at NASA. He's
one of many assigned to this problem.

204
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,548
l think it's time for you two
to head on out of here.

205
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,417
-Dr. Corvin, your country needs you.
-Put a sock in it, sonny.

206
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,450
Can't fix it from down here and
can't get a team up there in time.

207
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:12,655
That satellite's dying. lt'll
come back. My only hope is that...

208
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:16,995
...whatever doesn't burn up in the
atmosphere lands on Gerson's house.

209
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:25,344
l'll give you two career advice: Stay
away from Gerson, as far as possible.

210
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,281
Apparently the buzz on you's correct.

211
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,808
And what buzz is that?

212
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:38,016
You're not a team player.
That's why you washed out at NASA.

213
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,417
Get out.

214
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,967
We have to brush up
on your hospitality skills.

215
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,078
l think l have a solution
for your problem.

216
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,487
Frank Corvin.

217
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,120
So how long has it been, Frank?

218
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,791
Probably not long enough, Bob.

219
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,539
Still haven't lost
the Corvin charm, have we?

220
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,132
-Would you like a cup of coffee?
-Sure.

221
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,240
-Sara?
-No, thanks.

222
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:11,350
Miss Holland tells me you're
up to speed on our little problem.

223
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:15,187
We've got one sick bird up there.

224
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,686
Apparently, there's some kind of
design flaw in the guidance system.

225
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,925
This is a hell of a way to get
the designer to help you out.

226
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,459
l heard all about your
initial response.

227
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:33,070
But don't you worry none.
l'm sure we'll come up with something.

228
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,601
Dr. Corvin is here with a solution.

229
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,709
Well, praise the Lord and hallelujah.
We are delivered.

230
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,779
So...

231
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,516
...tell us about your solution, Frank.

232
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,618
Send my team up. We'll fix
your broken satellite for you.

233
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,992
-Damn good cup of coffee.
-Do you want to run that by me again?

234
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,793
Team Daedalus.

235
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,504
Jerry, Hawk, Tank. Send us up.

236
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,707
-This is a joke. Am l right?
-lt's no joke.

237
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,510
We were the best of the best.
Even you'll admit to that.

238
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,510
How old are you, Frank?

239
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,147
Old enough to know
your ass is in a sling.

240
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,056
Sara,
would you excuse us for a minute?

241
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,887
This is about to become
a personal matter.

242
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:41,338
l know you're running out of options.
Otherwise you'd have never come to me.

243
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,642
You sure as hell got that right.

244
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:48,507
You've got a satellite that's gonna
come down in 34 days.

245
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,375
Too big to retrieve...

246
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,110
...and for some reason you don't want
it to crash in the atmosphere.

247
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:58,687
l did the design system.
l'm the man to fix it for you.

248
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:03,324
l don't know how to break this to you,
but you're an old man.

249
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,029
Yeah?

250
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,563
This old man's all you've got.
You know that and l know that.

251
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,866
Hell, you sent up Glenn, didn't you?
l'll be waiting to hear from you.

252
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,369
You became a senior citizen
five years ago.

253
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,005
Four.

254
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:26,714
Hell, Frank. For once in your life,
try to be a team player.

255
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,778
Train the crew if you want to.

256
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:32,454
But let the professionals at NASA
fix that design flaw.

257
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,724
There is no flaw.

258
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:40,791
How it got on a Soviet satellite
during the Cold War is the only flaw.

259
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,434
How did that happen, Bob?

260
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,732
l don't know.

261
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,836
This is a hands-on job and l don't
have time to train somebody...

262
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,672
...to come up in time.

263
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,116
So you'll just have to
send up Team Daedalus.

264
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,218
-You can take it, or you can leave it.
-All right, all right.

265
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,418
You as a technical advisor, maybe.

266
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,892
But l can't fill up a space shuttle
with geriatrics.

267
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,463
You should be professional enough
to know that!

268
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,070
Hell, half those boys
are probably dead anyway.

269
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:23,601
Clock's ticking, Bob.
And l'm only getting older.

270
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,339
Okay. You got it.

271
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,572
Sir.

272
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,788
Mr. Gerson would like you
to wait right here.

273
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,793
Okay, it's a deal.

274
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,289
l want it in writing.

275
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,834
Okay.

276
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,935
Now hear my terms.

277
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:59,077
You and your entire crew'll have to
meet the physical requirements.

278
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:03,371
You'll all train to fix that guidance
system side by side with my people...

279
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,078
...in case one of your boys
doesn't pass.

280
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,548
-l think that's fair.
-You're damn straight it is.

281
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:15,057
l'll enjoy watching you make
a complete ass of yourself.

282
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,227
lt's gonna be a real pleasure
working with you again.

283
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,673
Romans...

284
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,175
...Chronicles. Chronicles. Ah, yes.

285
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,484
ln the 40th year,
Amariah begat Zadok...

286
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,415
...who begat Libni...

287
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,555
...the brother of Uzziah.

288
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,183
No, that's not it, either.

289
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,756
Just....

290
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:50,651
No....

291
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:16,552
Once upon a time, four of the best
pilots in the U.S. Air Force...

292
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,190
...trained to fly into space.

293
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:24,595
They flew at the speed of sound
to the very top of the sky...

294
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:29,066
...cheating death and free-falling
from 20 miles high.

295
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,111
Nice to see you, young man.

296
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,802
-And you, sir.
-Reverend.

297
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,948
lt's nice to have
you young people here.

298
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,242
Hey, boss.

299
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,386
Excuse me, my former boss.

300
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:54,116
l bring glad tidings, Reverend Tank,
in the name of Team Daedalus.

301
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,193
lt seems there might be
resurrection after all.

302
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,660
Come in and let's talk about it.

303
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:07,028
l don't know, Frank.
That's a very complicated proposition.

304
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:11,335
-l have a flock and grandchildren.
-They'll be here when you get back.

305
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,646
This'll give you material
for three or four more sermons.

306
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:18,277
-l'll need to pray about this.
-Could it be a quick prayer?

307
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,951
Just wait a moment,
my stiff-necked brother.

308
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,153
l'm receiving a word from on high.

309
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,527
And what is that word?

310
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:32,688
The word is, why the hell not?

311
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,031
There you go.

312
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:45,469
Good.

313
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,476
Second one's too fast.

314
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,777
Some little Johnny
will pass out on us there.

315
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:11,568
35 years of designing
supersonic aircraft for the military.

316
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:15,399
Now he's building roller coasters.
That's perfect.

317
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:20,045
-Your father's a gifted man.
-He's gifted, all right.

318
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,891
Too flat.

319
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,151
Oh, boy. We have some work to do.

320
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,323
Hey, sweetheart.

321
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,400
-You did good.
-They didn't do what l--

322
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,710
Hey, Frank.

323
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:55,079
Holy cow. What are you doing here?

324
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,083
Finding out what you're doing
for the next month and a half.

325
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,751
NASA wants to send us into space.

326
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,282
l wondered which one of us
was gonna go first.

327
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:08,883
Senile dementia.

328
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:13,429
40-year-old memories are sharp
but you can't remember your breakfast.

329
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,825
Frank Corvin, my associate, Cherie.

330
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,628
-Cherie.
-Hi.

331
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,396
What'd you have for breakfast?

332
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,698
l had vegetarian huevos rancheros,
egg whites only, of course...

333
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,845
...and then some sort of
a filtered decaf cappuccino...

334
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,515
...that was filtered
through a jockstrap.

335
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,309
-What are you talking about? NASA--
-Right here.

336
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,886
Right here. Here's our contract.

337
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,996
You don't need those, do you?

338
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:50,161
No. Just to read. And go to movies,
drive, walk. You know.

339
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,732
-Holy cow. How on earth--
-Are you in?

340
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,097
Am l in? Hell, yeah.

341
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:58,299
l can't believe it. Team Daedalus.
We ride again.

342
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,978
Hawk must've gone into orbit
when you told him.

343
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,044
l haven't talked to Hawk yet.

344
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,151
l haven't talked to Hawk
in a long time, Jerry.

345
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,989
When are the two of you gonna grow up
and stop acting like little boys?

346
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,331
lt's my birthday and l want
the shit scared out of me.

347
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:28,029
l wanna do barrel rolls and loop-the
loops. All that kind of stuff.

348
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:32,210
We don't do that kind of flying.
lt's dangerous and irresponsible.

349
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:35,039
-Yeah, too many lawsuits.
-Well, who does?

350
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,507
He does.

351
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,446
Sweet.

352
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:52,856
Hey, Hawk.

353
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:58,432
-This guy wants a scary ride.
-lt's my birthday.

354
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,674
Happy birthday.

355
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,979
Oh, we're upside-down! Oh, yeah!

356
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,493
Here comes the fun part.
We're going weightless.

357
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,762
l don't think that
that's such a good idea!

358
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,708
You're crazy!

359
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,914
l'm so sorry.

360
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,916
Where'd you get the bright idea
to eat a big lunch...

361
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,555
...before you come out here
and went flying?

362
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,555
-l'm sorry. l'll clean it up.
-That's all right. l'll get it.

363
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,895
Congratulations!

364
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:37,660
You earned your wings today,
young man. My hat's off to you!

365
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,498
Well done! Yes, sir.

366
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,236
-Splendid work.
-Thank you.

367
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:43,738
l surrender to you.

368
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,982
-l love you and being on the ground.
-What's that smell?

369
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,024
You know what the worst day
of my life was?

370
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,964
The day Armstrong
set foot on the moon.

371
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,332
l was the only one that wanted
to commit suicide that day.

372
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,008
Thanks. We haven't talked
in 12 years...

373
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,769
...and that's been
the big question on my mind:

374
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,106
What could make you commit suicide?

375
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:24,883
What are you doing here?

376
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,051
Filling a promise l made 40 years ago.

377
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,586
Was that the promise to kill me...

378
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:33,224
...or the one
to have both of my legs broke?

379
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,359
lt was the other one.

380
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,788
l'm working on a little blackmail
with NASA.

381
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,830
They've got a satellite that'll crash
unless we fix it.

382
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,662
l'm guessing you designed
that guidance system.

383
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,272
Yeah. They're desperate.
Even Gerson's in on the deal.

384
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,500
l said l'd do it if the original
Team Daedalus did the job.

385
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,880
Here it is, all in black and white.

386
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,349
Jerry and Tank are in and waiting
for us across the highway.

387
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:06,525
Old age just brings out
more of the Frank in you.

388
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,693
l'm genuinely impressed.

389
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:13,795
But you don't need to put foolish
notions in the head of a fool.

390
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,794
Especially not a damned old fool.

391
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,569
You have a nice flight.

392
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:22,531
You weren't one then,
but you are one now.

393
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,800
Say hello to Barbara for me.

394
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:28,311
Yeah, you say hello to Jackie.

395
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,407
l wished l could.

396
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,376
Jackie died on me, Frank.

397
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,385
Sorry. l didn't know that.

398
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,270
-He said no, huh?
-He's not coming.

399
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,032
Maybe we should talk to him.

400
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:33,404
He's the same stubborn jackass
he always was.

401
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:38,044
And you still drive slower than a
little old lady on her way to church.

402
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:12,078
That is enough to send the astronaut
miles and miles in space.

403
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:16,185
So what if l was to jump
on a trampoline in space?

404
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,323
You would go up and up and up...

405
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,084
...and you'd never come down!

406
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,592
Could you hit a baseball to the moon?

407
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,767
Actually, you could.

408
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,195
You'd just have to knock it
halfway there.

409
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,997
That's just about 100,000 miles.

410
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,004
And then the moon's gravity
does the rest.

411
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,274
-Okay? Bye-bye.
-Thank you.

412
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,269
-You're welcome.
-Thank you, Mrs. Holland.

413
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,442
l've never met a kid who didn't dream
of being an astronaut.

414
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,649
Ever meet a kid
that wouldn't grow up?

415
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:55,793
Sara Holland this is William Hawkins,
retired Air Force colonel.

416
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,519
The best pilot they ever had,
next to me.

417
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,591
The Hawk. l've heard of you.

418
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,429
Commander Jenkins told me a story
about you and him in Vietnam.

419
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:08,606
From Cliff Jenkins,
it's guaranteed to be 100% bullshit.

420
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,537
l'll guarantee you that.
How's he doing?

421
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,611
Actually, he's dead.

422
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:19,714
While Hawk gets his foot out of his
mouth, l'll introduce Tank Sullivan.

423
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:22,853
He's a navigator.
The best one the Air Force ever had.

424
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,081
He'd find anything anywhere.
That is, till God found him.

425
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,056
Now more than ever.
A pleasure to meet you.

426
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,492
This is Jerry O'Neill. He's
a structural engineer and designer.

427
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,792
Jerry worked on the Stealth project.
You remember that.

428
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:37,502
No nickname for you?

429
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,363
Well, you can call me...

430
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:40,727
...anytime.

431
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,298
Okay.

432
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:48,707
lf you men are ready,
we have some work to do.

433
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,280
Would you like a banana, honey?

434
00:35:55,854 --> 00:36:00,052
l don't need to remind you of
the consequences of failure here.

435
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:04,126
-Personal consequences.
-That's the problem with you Russians.

436
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,128
With you,
the glass is always half empty.

437
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,162
These men you are sending up,
they're not astronauts.

438
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:20,804
The last time they trained for a space
mission, cars had fins on them.

439
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,709
The truth is Frank Corvin's
not going anywhere.

440
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,477
His team's not gonna pass
the physical trials.

441
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,589
This is supposed to reassure me?

442
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,858
What will you do then?

443
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:42,227
My best young astronaut
is training alongside Corvin...

444
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:46,200
...gaining proficiency
in that antiquated guidance system.

445
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,806
Until he does, Frank Corvin's
gonna believe he's going up.

446
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,602
l don't know.

447
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,514
-We should consult--
-There will be no goddamn consulting.

448
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:05,452
No one, and l mean no one,
is to be in the loop...

449
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,324
...on our little problem.

450
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,190
Do l make myself perfectly clear,
general?

451
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,861
Good morning, all.

452
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:22,165
And welcome to STS-200 ops
overview briefing.

453
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,275
This is an unusual mission,
l think we'd all agree.

454
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,310
We'll get started
on the particulars here in a moment.

455
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:32,711
First, let's welcome the astronauts
selected for this mission:

456
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,046
The founding members
of Project Daedalus.

457
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:46,486
As you all know, these men
are the pioneers of this business.

458
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,224
They were around
when rockets were born.

459
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,365
Welcome, gentlemen.

460
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:57,702
STS-200 was originally slated
to deliver a structural payload...

461
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,207
...to the lnternational Space Station.

462
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:04,678
Circumstances have forced us to push
back that mission and undertake...

463
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,680
...an emergency rescue operation.

464
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:10,286
The average staging time for
a mission is 12 months.

465
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:14,117
We're doing this one in 30 days.

466
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,426
ln 1986...

467
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:23,431
...the former Soviet Union launched
communications satellite lkon.

468
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,126
-lkon is a link...
-l'll tell you about it later.

469
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,704
...in Russia's
telecommunications chain.

470
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,476
Her orbit is rapidly decaying.

471
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:35,169
She will reenter
the Earth's atmosphere in 30 days.

472
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,281
Your mission
is to intercept and capture her...

473
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,576
...using the shuttle's grappling arm.

474
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:43,049
You will then have a 42-hour window...

475
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,247
...in which to repair
her guidance system.

476
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,359
From there she'll be reconfigured
by Mission Control.

477
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:52,655
After that, you'll shoot
her back into geosync orbit...

478
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:56,129
...using the payload assist
module rockets.

479
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,103
Any questions?

480
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:02,733
Question.

481
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:08,008
With all due respect to the guys,
why don't we just capture the bird...

482
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,512
...bring it home with a crew
trained in satellite retrieval?

483
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,711
lt's too big, Gene.

484
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,448
Too big?

485
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,448
For the space shuttle?

486
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:27,393
How did you guys get it up there
in the first place?

487
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:31,568
There were modifications
post-deployment.

488
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,071
Listen up, people.

489
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,474
This system has to be fixed on-site.

490
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,474
Frank is the only engineer...

491
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,705
...proficient in
such obsolete technology.

492
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,112
Given the short amount of time...

493
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,618
...he's the only engineer
to do the job.

494
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:57,018
So Frank Corvin's band of...

495
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:00,393
...Leisure World aviators
are going into space.

496
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,226
NASA agree to all this?
Did the Russians?

497
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,802
-Frank didn't give us a lot of choice.
-l figured that.

498
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:10,498
You hate each other way too much
to have cooked this up together.

499
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,404
Count me out.

500
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,881
l think you guys
need to get a new flight director.

501
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,817
You know, one thing
is driving me nuts, though.

502
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,854
How did a guidance system from Skylab
end up in a Russian bird?

503
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:32,519
l don't know, Gene, but apparently
l'm the man who can fix it.

504
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:37,668
Grow up, will you, Frank?
Can't you be a team player for once?

505
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,303
Why can't you assist my astronauts
as an engineer?

506
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:46,068
lf l wasn't 100% sure that my guys
could do as well as your astronauts...

507
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,541
...l wouldn't go anywhere near it.

508
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,114
Still the same old Frank, huh?

509
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,441
Well, that's the consensus
around here.

510
00:40:56,487 --> 00:41:00,982
So you fellas made a deal?
Fine. Here's my deal.

511
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,359
l am the flight director and
l can pull the plug on this one.

512
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,121
When it's over, it's over.

513
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,994
l am not turning over
a new space shuttle...

514
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:14,271
...to rookies with a month's training.
You're taking two of my guys.

515
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:19,910
Ethan, who's a brown-nosing snot
and Roger, who's a cocky little shit.

516
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:22,610
But they're the two best astronauts.

517
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,715
They fly or the package
stays on the ground.

518
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,981
-Deal?
-Well, okay, Gene.

519
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,449
And if l sense for one second...

520
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,922
...that your team isn't cutting it
physically or mentally...

521
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:39,119
...you're off,
and my original team flies.

522
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,666
So let's see if you still
got it to go.

523
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,126
Suck it up, Frank.

524
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:53,469
-Gene's the same guy l remembered.
-Yeah, he's an asshole.

525
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,339
-A prick.
-Some things never change.

526
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:59,014
Now just cough when l say, okay?

527
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,645
Cough.

528
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,511
And again, please.

529
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:04,711
Morning, gentlemen.

530
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:09,316
l'm Dr. Caruthers.
l'll be assisting Dr. Michaelson here.

531
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,089
Hi.

532
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,805
Nothing to be ashamed of.

533
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,672
Easy for you to say.

534
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:26,002
-Cover your eye and read the chart.
-Time me.

535
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:28,110
"E, F, L, E, P, T...

536
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,008
...P, L, E, P, F, L, F, L, E...

537
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,978
...P, T, P, L, F, E, T, E...

538
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:35,585
...L, O, P, Z, D, D, E,
F, P, O, T, E, C...

539
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,580
...F, L, E, P, T, P, L, E, P...

540
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,988
...F, L, F, L, E, P, T, P, L,
F, L, T, M, A, D...

541
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,150
...in U, S, A."

542
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:48,424
Made in the USA.
That's one for the economy, l guess.

543
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,200
You have 20и10 vision.

544
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,530
-l'll be damned.
-And 14 seconds.

545
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:57,866
All right. "E, F, L, E, P, T...

546
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,010
...P, L, E, P, F, L, E...

547
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:05,149
...L, E, P, T, L, P, E, F,
E, T, Z, E, T...

548
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,209
...T."

549
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,185
-20и20.
-And five seconds slow.

550
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,582
Good.

551
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,453
-Next.
-l'm next.

552
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:19,896
-Five seconds, my ass.
-l wish l could be your next.

553
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:24,696
Get your ииaии6 to take you to a
French brasserie and give you oysters.

554
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:28,395
-lf he won't, can l?
-Let's see how you do on your physical.

555
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,735
l'll just do the bottom three lines.
F, L, E, P, T, P...

556
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,503
...L, E, P, F, L, F,
L, E, P, T, P, L, F, E, T."

557
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,909
Do you think oysters would be
too much for the first date?

558
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:43,053
-You have 20и10 vision, captain.
-These are just for looking at you.

559
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,925
l may be blind, Frank,
but my memory's perfect.

560
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:54,794
Next.

561
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:56,998
Colonel Hawkins.

562
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:00,794
You all right?

563
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:05,101
-l'm just not too crazy about needles.
-Well, that's pretty common.

564
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,372
Make a fist
and pump it a couple times.

565
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,248
Okay, that's good.

566
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,478
-You don't remember me, do you?
-What?

567
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,485
My father was flight surgeon
at Beale Air Force Base.

568
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,123
Oh, yeah.

569
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:24,385
-Dr. Martin. The Goat.
-The Goat, yeah. That was my dad.

570
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,656
l met you when l was 12 years old.
l doubt you remember.

571
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,560
Now wait a minute now.

572
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,293
Pigtails, freckles
and knobby little knees.

573
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,130
-Was that you?
-That was me.

574
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,940
-How is old Goat?
-He passed away nine years ago.

575
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,674
You noticed how everybody
seems to be dead lately?

576
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,683
-Yeah.
-l hear that.

577
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,824
You guys ready to do some laps?

578
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:55,685
Sure.

579
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,726
-We'll go easy today. We'll do ten.
-Minutes?

580
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,125
Miles. Let's go.

581
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,697
Miles.

582
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,800
-Little prick.
-Frank.

583
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:07,670
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

584
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,341
Did he really mean miles?

585
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,582
-How far have we gone, Frank?
-Almost two.

586
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:28,885
-l'm going to have a heart attack.
-That's the point.

587
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:31,619
-What? To give us heart attacks?
-Hell, yes.

588
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,729
Suppose we didn't make liftoff.

589
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:37,060
We'd be the first country
to launch dead bodies into orbit.

590
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,962
lf we have heart attacks...

591
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,866
...NASA will want us
to have it right here on Earth.

592
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,837
-Get moving.
-l'm an engineer, for crying out loud.

593
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:49,377
-l stopped running during Nixon.
-Your lady doctor's watching.

594
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,877
-She is?
-Oh, no.

595
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,223
Do 225, colonel?

596
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,361
Oh, hell, yes.
Hell, yes. Spot me, tiger.

597
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:10,727
You got it.

598
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,228
-Ready? There we go.
-Yeah.

599
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,237
All right, let it go.
Let her go, Hawk.

600
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,411
Come on, you can do it. Thattaboy.

601
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,341
Thattaboy.

602
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:27,142
All right. Push, baby.
Push, push. Up.

603
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,843
All right, come on. Here we go.

604
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:31,479
Let her go.

605
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,088
Let her go. Push it, baby.

606
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,790
Come on. Yeah, you got it.

607
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,088
You the man. All right.
l got it. l got it.

608
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:40,791
All right now!

609
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,467
-Thattaboy.
-Oh, yes, sir.

610
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:45,101
Not bad.

611
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:49,931
You trying to do something
over there.

612
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,610
Anything worth doing's
worth doing well.

613
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,770
l'm going to go
to my room now and cry.

614
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,453
l'm too tired to chew.

615
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:13,457
Try to look a little perkier,
will you, fellas?

616
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:22,466
You still want to go on with this,
Frank?

617
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:27,540
What do you want to do, quit now?
We just finished the tough stuff.

618
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:29,770
Now we start training for the mission.

619
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,475
-Everybody get a good night's sleep.
-There's a real challenge.

620
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,617
What are you doing?

621
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:40,520
What are you doing?

622
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,060
Goddamn...

623
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,653
...teeth won't stay in.

624
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,665
Damn, Jerry.

625
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,025
Jesus.

626
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:55,972
Gentlemen, a round of drinks
from your friends over there...

627
00:47:56,173 --> 00:48:00,133
...who ordered you some goodies.
A little Ensure for you guys.

628
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,149
To old gummers in space.

629
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,376
Cheers.

630
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,256
l drink this stuff.

631
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,017
lt's good for your libido.

632
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,163
-Race you the last lap.
-All right.

633
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,497
-Okay. Countdown to one?
-All right.

634
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:28,865
One!

635
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,889
Frank, hi. l was looking for Hawk.

636
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,896
Well, come on in. Come on in.

637
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:04,165
He's right in there. Go ahead.
The coast is all clear.

638
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:06,070
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

639
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,215
l am so sorry.

640
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:19,786
No, it's okay. lt's okay.
lt's all right.

641
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,260
What brings you to
the men's locker room?

642
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:29,593
Gene moved up the stimulator, l mean,
l'm sorry, the simulator run.

643
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,659
Okay. To when?

644
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,601
Oh, right. That would be...

645
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:39,707
...1 1 :00.

646
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:44,143
There were some procedures
that l wanted you to be aware of.

647
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:49,780
This is very uncomfortable,
and l'll be leaving now.

648
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:54,153
l'm going to take you out for a beer.

649
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,157
l'll be needing one.

650
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,629
Here we go.

651
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,126
Right on target.

652
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,129
Hi. Jerry O'Neill.

653
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,334
Do you mind, lady?
You make me nervous.

654
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:16,377
Get used to it. You'll have a lot
more people watching you on TV.

655
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,106
Thank you. Very comforting.

656
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,417
-You don't make me nervous.
-Oh, Jerry.

657
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:28,724
l got a roller coaster that'll stop
your heart. l threw up on my helmet!

658
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:32,294
That was three Gs. As bad as it gets
during ascent and reentry.

659
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,693
l am so pleased.
lt was a piece of cake, guys.

660
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,925
Okay, thanks.

661
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,846
-First one to pass out buys the beer.
-You're on.

662
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,251
This thing moving?

663
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:08,258
l don't know.
Doesn't seem to be moving to me.

664
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:14,730
Say, fellas, is y'all's
equipment broke down?

665
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,642
What's going on?

666
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:35,325
Makes them look younger, doesn't it?

667
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:39,622
-You're a pushover.
-l do believe it's moving now.

668
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,137
That sure will take the wrinkles out.

669
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,637
What the hell's going on here!?

670
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:02,750
l'm sure you think you're putting on
a great show, but this is not a toy!

671
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:08,749
Now which one of you idiots
wants to explain this?

672
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:10,249
Gene.

673
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:12,585
What?

674
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:16,864
Which one of us passed out first?

675
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,803
l'm getting too old for this shit.

676
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:50,532
l can cook things you wouldn't
believe. l cook crab, lobster.

677
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:06,139
That'll be seven dollars.

678
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,241
Hello?

679
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,482
l'm sorry. He's buying.

680
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:16,656
-We both passed out at the same time.
-Bullshit.

681
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,353
l saw you pass out just before
l passed out. l saw that.

682
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:24,193
But never mind. l'll get this round
because of my confidence.

683
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:28,270
Absolute confidence in my superiority,
absolute superiority to you...

684
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:31,498
...in every human endeavor in life.
Keep the change.

685
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,041
We'll leave it up to the young lady.

686
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,806
Tell me, given the circumstances
which one of us...

687
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:41,383
-...would you take home tonight?
-You mean, like, to the home?

688
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:44,612
-Yeah.
-Like, the retirement home?

689
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,847
Seriously.
Would you choose this man...

690
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,050
...with his asymmetrical
sagging ass cheeks...

691
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,490
...love handles
the size of Nebraska...

692
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,529
...and his gross, old,
ugly ingrown toenails?

693
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:59,191
Or this hairy-eared son of a bitch
with a chicken gizzard neck...

694
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:02,202
...and a face like
Death Valley fire trails?

695
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:06,069
-Stop harassing the waitress.
-l'm not. What are you talking about?

696
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:09,542
l'm having a private conversation
that doesn't involve you.

697
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:13,649
Go back to your virgin pink daiquiri
and mind your own business.

698
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:17,014
She's my friend who has to put up
with assholes like you.

699
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:18,654
-Tiny--
-But l don't.

700
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,619
lf you want to harass, harass me.

701
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:25,095
-l believe he's harassing you already.
-l'll put you in the hospital.

702
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,594
l have Medicare.
Shoot your best shot.

703
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:30,358
-l'll make your old lady a widow.
-Don't--

704
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:34,766
Wait! You can't do this! No,
you're going up into space in 22 days.

705
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:37,532
lf you break a bone
or sprain your ankle...

706
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,541
...your space shuttle seat'll go to
that MIT weenie with blow-dried hair.

707
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:44,408
We'll watch the launch on TV
at your damn house.

708
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:48,312
-What makes you think l'll hurt myself?
-What about a space shuttle?

709
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:52,250
You're gonna blow this for us again.
You and your mean-ass temper.

710
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:56,688
-Are you saying l blew it back in '58?
-Hell, yes, you blew it in '58.

711
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:59,590
You crashed every plane
the Air Force gave us.

712
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,822
All right. We're taking this outside.

713
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,263
l'll whip your ass!
Get out there in that parking lot!

714
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,029
You wait here, Tiny.

715
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:11,974
-Let's go.
-l got ten on Frank.

716
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,476
Can l get your ass
out of a jam or not?

717
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,414
Did you see that guy's face
when l said--

718
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:28,785
Just who got Team Daedalus canned,
Colonel Hawkins?

719
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,291
Damn, this is gonna be a long night.

720
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:42,328
Hawk's pretty quick.
Frank's got the reach, however.

721
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:46,235
That girl l was dancing with
was a database administrator.

722
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:47,638
Really?

723
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:50,208
Morning, partner.

724
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,776
-Morning, Hawk.
-Good morning.

725
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:55,645
-What happened to your eye?
-l fell in the shower.

726
00:55:55,852 --> 00:56:00,654
Tell maintenance to put some no-slip
adhesives on that slippery floor.

727
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:06,919
How's that right there?

728
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,994
Still ten megahertz,
maybe a little more.

729
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:14,764
How's it going, Frank?

730
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:18,071
Fine. Fine.

731
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:20,935
What's with the eye?

732
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,373
Slip in the shower?

733
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:26,378
How would you know that?

734
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:29,979
l'll chat with the janitor.

735
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:40,054
Airspeed, 300.

736
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:42,998
Crosswind on our right, 14 knots.

737
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:48,035
Running a little hot.
Want to open up a speed brake?

738
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:51,505
200.

739
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:54,907
100.

740
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,049
Touchdown.

741
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,052
Nice landing, guys.

742
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:07,189
Let's put the rookies up front.
Simsupe, you on with me?

743
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:08,756
Simsupe. Go, Gene.

744
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,552
-lt's gonna be tough to beat.
-l think so.

745
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,594
You up.

746
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:17,428
Standard package.

747
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:20,604
Let's throw them a Little League
kind of curve.

748
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,772
Hydraulic failure.
Switching to secondary.

749
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:25,407
l'm going to manual control.

750
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,908
You can't do that, colonel.
The bird's on a computerized track.

751
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:34,944
1000 feet. Your airspeed's too high.
Stick to their protocol, will you?

752
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:37,416
l'm going to manual control.
Goddamn, boy.

753
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,589
You cannot do that!

754
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,858
Secondary hydraulic failure.

755
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,186
-You'll come in short.
-Like hell.

756
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,628
Shit.

757
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:56,105
Come on. You can't throw that
at them on the first run.

758
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,367
We got three weeks to send
four old farts into space.

759
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,943
This is flight school 101 stuff.

760
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:08,282
Look, this is not a stripped-down show
plane. You gotta do it their way.

761
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,545
l don't need a computer
to tell me how to land a plane.

762
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:14,281
lt's not a plane.
lt's a flying brick on approach.

763
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,688
-You got to use the on-board computer.
-What if it fails?

764
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,593
lt's never failed.

765
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:21,589
Houston, Horizon.

766
00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:23,289
Go, Horizon.

767
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:27,394
Request secondary landing, please.
Houston, Horizon.

768
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:30,437
Request on-board computer failure...

769
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,836
...on second landing.

770
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:34,943
All right, run it again.

771
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,877
-Horizon, stand by for 2nd approach.
-Sock it to them.

772
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,580
3000 feet. Coming in too steep.

773
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,421
Pull up, sir. You'll lose it again.

774
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,147
Fire in Av Bay Two.
You'll lose avionics.

775
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:51,687
l don't need them anyway, this thing's
a flying brick on approach.

776
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,093
Wind shear off the nose
and the fire is contained.

777
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,267
Computers are down. She's all yours.

778
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,401
500 feet. You're almost lined up.

779
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,704
Your airspeed is way too high.

780
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:05,170
Airspeed is four-niner-zero.
Coming in too high.

781
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,844
-You'll overshoot.
-You won't get it stopped.

782
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:11,776
lt's easy. All you got to do is
tap on the brakes a little bit.

783
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:21,022
Not that much.
You'll put her into a stall.

784
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:25,560
100 feet.
You know what you're doing, right?

785
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:29,221
-l'm tapping on the brakes a bit.
-Drop the nose! You'll lose it.

786
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:30,457
Knock it off!

787
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:31,759
Drop the nose.

788
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,733
-What's the airspeed?
-200. You're right on it.

789
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:38,898
What do you say we just
drop that nose a little bit...

790
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,577
...like that right there.

791
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:47,950
Smooth as a baby's ass.

792
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,119
That's impossible.

793
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,886
For a computer it might be.

794
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,592
Flying brick.

795
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:57,983
l like that.

796
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:10,740
Ladies and gentlemen, from your
teammates at the table over there.

797
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:13,469
Gerber's baby food.

798
01:00:13,677 --> 01:00:17,010
And some training material
for you to look over.

799
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:19,444
Pictures for the bigger words.

800
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,115
A talking frog's worth something.

801
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,293
-40 percent.
-40 percent?!

802
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:32,826
You might nail it.
You might crash and burn.

803
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,828
-The odds are against you, colonel.
-Watch this.

804
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,164
40 percent.

805
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:43,704
40 percent for you, you nail it.

806
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:46,569
40 percent for me,
l'd have missed by a mile.

807
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:49,371
That's why l got out of
the astronaut program.

808
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:54,013
l knew my chances of getting on
a space shuttle were way less than 40.

809
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,811
But l was an astronaut, almost.

810
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,320
-You'd have been a damn good one too.
-Thank you.

811
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:06,161
You don't think like that. You've
jumped out of planes 20 miles up.

812
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,389
You drove rocket sleds
at the speed of sound.

813
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:13,430
-You're not afraid of anything.
-l've been afraid.

814
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:16,003
Oh, bullshit. When?

815
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:21,437
When l was 17 years old.

816
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:27,283
l was crazy in love
with this college girl.

817
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,583
She was beautiful. Oh, gorgeous.

818
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,482
And a ball of fire.

819
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:34,918
She, of course,
was crazy in love with--

820
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,422
-You.
-No.

821
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:39,289
Texas AQM's all-American defensive end
Scott LeBeau.

822
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:43,194
And l mean, this cat
was six-foot-six if he was a foot.

823
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,899
Gary Cooper handsome.

824
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:50,998
One day, a bunch of friends and l
decided we'd drink too much beer...

825
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,972
...and crash a big old
sorority cotillion.

826
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:58,273
You know, everybody's dressed up
in chiffon gowns and Daddy's tuxedo.

827
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:03,044
There we are, looking like a bunch
of brush poppers and goat ropers.

828
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,984
-At the governor's ranch too.
-l'm beginning to get the picture.

829
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:12,628
So my friends tell me that they see
LeBeau entering the Port-a-Potty.

830
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:15,423
One of them little old
fiberglass shithouses.

831
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:18,465
l did a better tackle on that
fiberglass shithouse...

832
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:21,297
...than he ever did
on the football field....

833
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:24,099
...and the thing rolled
down a bluff into a creek.

834
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:27,174
Screaming and yelling
all the way down...

835
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:30,836
...except it don't sound like no
all-American defensive end.

836
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:35,985
-lt's decidedly more feminine.
-Oh, no, you didn't.

837
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:40,521
The love of my life, rolling down
the bluff in a fiberglass shithouse.

838
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:43,124
lt was very, very sad.

839
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,858
-What happened then?
-l ran like hell.

840
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:50,761
-Joined the Air Force the next day.
-Afraid LeBeau'd kick your ass.

841
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,561
Well, hell, no.
l wasn't afraid of him.

842
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,102
l was afraid, l mean...

843
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,765
...truly afraid of her.

844
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:03,008
Are you afraid of me?

845
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,049
l married her.

846
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:18,918
Four years later.

847
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,082
What? l'm only 15 minutes late.

848
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:56,562
Oh, shit.

849
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:03,336
Extra, extra. Read all about it.

850
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,906
l don't know how this leaked out.
l swear.

851
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:09,943
NASA's been getting calls from
every tabloid in the country...

852
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:12,342
...asking me to verify that story.

853
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:15,251
Why can't we verify the story?

854
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,581
-Why?
-Yeah.

855
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:21,314
Because STS-200 is a delicate,
top-secret satellite recovery...

856
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,049
...that's why.

857
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:25,989
That makes it look like
a goddamn three-ring circus.

858
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:29,455
How do you think the vice president
felt this morning...

859
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,964
...when he opened his paper
and saw that?

860
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,897
lt's easy for you to laugh.
You don't deal with him. l do.

861
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:46,408
We're going to simulate your
onboard living conditions...

862
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:49,881
...to familiarize you with
the new living environment.

863
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:58,692
Watch your step.

864
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:01,120
-What the hell's this thing?
-ACM.

865
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:06,725
-Asshole Centering Monitor.
-Gentlemen, this is your funnel.

866
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:09,701
lt attaches to the hose here.

867
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:14,070
Before starting, make sure you have
a tight seal against your skin.

868
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:17,643
-ls that the only one you got?
-Yes, one size does fit all.

869
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:22,012
But just in case, there's a diaper
underneath your pressurized suits.

870
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:25,154
-l'll use that.
-l'm sure you will.

871
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,454
Anything else?

872
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,027
You're having a bit of an acid thing.

873
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,865
-No, no, no.
-lt's a flashback.

874
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,905
No, no. Seriously.

875
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:51,848
Avionics on this thing, some of them
are quite old. B-52-type stuff.

876
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:58,412
My next guests are the most famous men
in America. There they are on People.

877
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,886
USA Today calls them
"The Ripe Stuff."

878
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,616
Please welcome Team Daedalus.

879
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:10,463
-How are you?
-Nice to see you.

880
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:12,294
Have a seat, guys.

881
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,535
Thank you, gentlemen.

882
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:26,979
lt's an honor to meet you all.
This is a very exciting story.

883
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,516
You all come from varied backgrounds.

884
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:33,485
One of you is a Baptist minister.

885
01:06:34,257 --> 01:06:37,249
ls that Tank? Can l call you Tank?
Tank Sullivan.

886
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,326
You may call me Tank.

887
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:42,460
What is that?
That's a cross with a rocket on it.

888
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,259
What faith is that?
l'm not familiar with it.

889
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:46,492
-lt's mine.
-Lutheran?

890
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:49,229
-What is it? What is it?
-lt's Baptist.

891
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:52,772
Which guy is the babe magnet?
That would be Jerry.

892
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:54,773
-That's Jerry.
-Are you?

893
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:58,004
l keep telling these guys
it's got nothing to do with me.

894
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:00,308
lt depends entirely on the woman...

895
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:05,454
...and how willing she is to discover
her infinite supply of orgasms.

896
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:07,089
-Really?
-Yeah, it's true.

897
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:13,661
-lt's the truth.
-You know, l think...

898
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:18,196
...women watching are going, "No
matter their age, men never change."

899
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:26,138
-You all have a military background?
-That's true. That's true.

900
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:29,039
Noиh or South? Which side?
l'm teasing.

901
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:30,770
-You see-- l'm sorry.
-Low.

902
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,313
l know, l know. You can't help it.

903
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:46,792
What did he do?

904
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,579
So the relay patch is the key?

905
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:11,982
Plain as the nose on your face.

906
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:16,754
-How'd you bypass the heat exchanger?
-l didn't bypass anything.

907
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,620
You're not being very forthcoming
on the guidance system.

908
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,230
Kid, l've done everything
short of...

909
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:26,266
...calculus instructions to bring you
up to speed.

910
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:29,439
What do you want, a picture?
Connect the dots?

911
01:08:30,073 --> 01:08:33,668
Excuse me. l hold two master's
degrees from MIT, Dr. Corvin.

912
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:35,936
Maybe you ought to
get your money back.

913
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:39,672
You were just brought up on
a different set of technologies.

914
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:44,047
You're compromising this mission. l'm
your backup on a need-to-know basis.

915
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:47,184
You don't need to know dick.
l don't need a backup.

916
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,585
Yes, you do.

917
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,088
More than you know.

918
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,494
What's that supposed to mean?

919
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:57,055
What don't l know?

920
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,594
What don't l know?

921
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:05,468
You son of a bitch.
You're setting me up again.

922
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:10,377
Here's one of our astronauts now.
What a semi-pleasant surprise.

923
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:14,573
-You had no intention of sending me up.
-l'm in the middle of something now.

924
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:17,978
Well, now, that's great.

925
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:21,713
You hung up on the head of
our program: the U.S. vice president.

926
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:25,417
-What can l do for you?
-You had no intention of sending me up.

927
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,894
You screwed me over in 1958
and you're screwing me over now!

928
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:30,800
l screwed you over?

929
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,596
What did l do, make a deal with you
anyway? A chronic liar!

930
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:39,232
What deal? l didn't make any deal
with you. You blackmailed me.

931
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:44,039
lf you want to stick by your
so-called deal, then you lost.

932
01:09:44,414 --> 01:09:46,177
l don't have to send you up.

933
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:49,977
What is all this?

934
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,622
lt means someone on your team
didn't pass his physical.

935
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:55,484
One of you has cancer.

936
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,027
lt's in his pancreas.

937
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,133
And it's inoperable.

938
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,136
Does he know about it?

939
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,974
Dr. Caruthers talked to him
this morning.

940
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,144
Jesus.

941
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,708
No.

942
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,481
No. We're going to get another
doctor and get another opinion.

943
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:31,627
Not one that's on your payroll.
This is even low by your standards.

944
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:34,126
You'll do anything
to keep me from going up.

945
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,096
Oh, really?

946
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:39,028
So that's what this drama's all about.

947
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,500
This whole time l thought
it was about your friend Hawk!

948
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:45,834
But it's really about your seat
on the space shuttle.

949
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:50,673
You can just back off, because NASA
will send you up in the space shuttle.

950
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,815
You, Jerry and Tank, regardless
of whatever deal you had with me!

951
01:10:55,885 --> 01:11:00,220
-l don't understand.
-Come on. You're front-page news now.

952
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:05,156
A genuine all-American hero. You've
made NASA popular all over again.

953
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,353
Thanks to you, they'll get
their juicy budget infusion...

954
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:10,396
...they've been drooling over.

955
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,866
You're going up, all right.
The vice president insists.

956
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:20,669
l have to call the head
of the space program back.

957
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:23,676
You've got a lot of work to do
before we leave.

958
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:31,243
And you shut the door!

959
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,023
This is my Blackbird.

960
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:47,403
l retired this very airplane in 1990.

961
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:49,399
And now...

962
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:50,898
...here we sit.

963
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,234
l've never actually seen one before.

964
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:55,911
SR-71 . This is what
a plane's supposed to be.

965
01:11:56,112 --> 01:12:00,981
This is ugly on the ground, leaks like
a sieve, but up around Mach one...

966
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:06,087
...the seals all expand, she dries up,
flies like a bat out of hell.

967
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:09,418
l took her right to the limit.

968
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,589
128,000 feet.

969
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,590
She's only happy...

970
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:19,160
...going fast. lt's not meant to sit.

971
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:22,804
That's a lousy way to die,
just sitting around waiting....

972
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:28,611
-ls eight months the best l can do?
-They don't know.

973
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:32,179
-There's chemo, radiation.
-Shit.

974
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:35,949
l watched my wife go out that way.
l ain't doing it.

975
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,382
The love of your life.

976
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,788
What is a pancreas anyhow?

977
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:48,459
l mean, l don't know what
the damn thing does for you...

978
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,398
...besides give you cancer.

979
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:57,164
What kind of odds would
you give you and me?

980
01:12:57,974 --> 01:12:59,669
Better than 40.

981
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,131
l know how much this flight
meant to you.

982
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,067
Looks like l crashed another one.
l'm sorry.

983
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,209
They want to take Jerry
and Tank and me.

984
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:37,903
That's great. You played them
fellas just right. That's good.

985
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:41,914
-You said yes, didn't you?
-l didn't say anything.

986
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:45,520
You don't want to blow it again.
This is your last shot.

987
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,283
This isn't easy.

988
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:50,516
Easy, hell.
Don't whine to me about easy.

989
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,319
Put yourself in my shoes.

990
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,122
You've been blaming me for 40 years.

991
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:58,926
You're not laying this on me.
You choke this one, it's on you.

992
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:01,501
-All on you.
-What would you do?

993
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:03,695
l'd leave your ass on the ground.

994
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,237
l'll bet you would.

995
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,500
To go into space? You bet your ass.

996
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,613
ln a heartbeat.

997
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,177
Know what the worst day
in my life was?

998
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,119
The day you put the idea in my head
l could pilot a ship in space.

999
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:37,770
l don't care what happens.
lf this gets out to the press--

1000
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,101
lt's not about the press right now.

1001
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,278
But whether Roger or Ethan--

1002
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:45,309
l'm not going up. Not without Hawk.

1003
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,741
-You're gonna blackmail me again?
-No, no.

1004
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:53,087
l'll teach Ethan what he needs
to know. l don't go if Hawk doesn't.

1005
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:59,051
-Any ideas, Miss Holland?
-Yes.

1006
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:02,355
Even with the cancer,
he still passed his physical...

1007
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:07,093
...so there's no reason he can't fly
the mission. Especially with backup.

1008
01:15:07,303 --> 01:15:09,772
You and Frank will put me
in the loony bin.

1009
01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:20,845
Colonel Corvin? Miss Holland would
like you to wait here, sir.

1010
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,354
Team Daedalus, all of Team Daedalus...

1011
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,822
...has a launch in 92 hours.

1012
01:15:31,594 --> 01:15:35,189
So let's get rested and prepped.

1013
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,825
Okay. Yes.

1014
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:39,428
What's this?

1015
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:40,999
Have a look.

1016
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:47,176
UTMC-coated, 1 .66, super high index
lenses on a Flexon alloy frame.

1017
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:50,378
-Your prescription.
-My prescription?

1018
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,541
Holy cow.

1019
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,043
Holy cow.

1020
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:57,946
l had them made for you.

1021
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,914
-You owe me dinner now.
-You'd go out with Spider-Man?

1022
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:05,492
-lf he'll buy me oysters.
-l'll buy you pearls.

1023
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,560
l feel like dancing.

1024
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,395
Bring that man back alive!

1025
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:46,233
No, that's against my better
judgement, Barb.

1026
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:51,096
l won't let him die.

1027
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,761
General Corvin, General Hawkins,

1028
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:18,525
-We're not generals, son.
-Just saying it like it ought to be.

1029
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:40,355
You're good to go, men.

1030
01:17:40,556 --> 01:17:42,991
See you back on the ground,
Team Daedalus.

1031
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:45,394
Good luck.

1032
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:52,559
Well, we've only waited 40 years.

1033
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:56,838
What do you say, Reverend Tank?
ls a prayer in order?

1034
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,641
l was just reciting
the Shepard's prayer.

1035
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,572
Alan Shepard's prayer.

1036
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:07,076
"Oh, Lord, please don't let us
screw up."

1037
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:09,341
-Amen.
-Amen.

1038
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:10,985
-Amen.
-Amen.

1039
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,956
Amen, Reverend.

1040
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:26,496
Let's have a comm check.

1041
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:28,929
-PLT.
-MS One.

1042
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:30,662
-MS Two.
-MS Three.

1043
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:31,863
MS Four.

1044
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:35,972
Fido, go. Guidance, go.

1045
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:38,177
EECOM, go.

1046
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:40,776

T-minus ten, nine, eight, seven.

1049
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,608
We have a go for main engine start.

1050
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:13,075
Three, two, one. lgnition.

1051
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:30,662
Liftoff of the space shuttle Daedalus
and STS-200.

1052
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:55,747
How's it going?

1053
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,918
Space will never be the same.

1054
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:05,256
Houston, this is Daedalus.

1055
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:07,093
Roll program.

1056

Roger roll, Daedalus.

1057
01:20:13,776 --> 01:20:15,744
Thank you, God.

1058
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:21,576
Stand by for throttles up.

1059

Roger, Houston. Go with throttles up.

1061
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:35,797
Stand by for separation of SRBs.

Stand by for SRB sep.

1063

01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,884
Negative return.

1065
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:09,860
Roger, Daedalus.
You are negative return.

1066
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,356
We're just a dot.

1067

Two engines tal.

1068

Press to ATO.

1069
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,843
Houston, do we have a go
for orbit ops?

01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:31,179
Roger, Daedalus.
You are go for orbit ops.

1071
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:33,244
Good work, guys.

1072
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:39,988
Four hours to intercept.
We're right on schedule.

1073
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:42,687
That's not what l'm worried about.

1074
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,556
Relax.

1075
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,025
Our man is up there with them.

1076
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:33,874
lt was worth the wait.

1077
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:35,682
-Yeah, it was.
-Thank you, Frank.

1078
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:38,146
l owe you one.

1079
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:42,215
Not a bad takeoff...

1080
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,286
...for some rookies.

1081
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:49,327
You guys are over, over the edge.
You're in space.

1082
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:52,592
-Welcome to the club.
-Thank you, Roger.

1083
01:22:58,407 --> 01:23:03,345
Okay, Daedalus has got lkon
on the scopes.

1084
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:06,842
We should have a visual here
momentarily.

1085
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,016
Range, 5000 meters.

1086
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:12,879
Roger, Hawk, we have a visual here.

1087
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:20,156
Stand by for a 15-second burn.

1088
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,734
All right, get ready
to deploy the arm.

1089
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,206
Deploying the arm.

1090
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,319
2200 feet.

1091
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,354
Dead center.
Good driving up there, Hawk.

1092
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,324
Let's light them up.

1093
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:54,118
Stand by. T.l. burn in four,
three, two, one.

1094
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:04,295
Hello, lkon. How we feeling today?

1095
01:24:04,907 --> 01:24:07,205
Activating floods.

1096
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:37,428
Boy. Will you get a load of this?

1097
01:24:45,714 --> 01:24:47,375
Activating radar.

1098
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:30,587
-He's trying to get a tone on us.
-What are you saying?

1099
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,694
Shut the radar down.
lt's painting a target on us.

1100
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,261
Radar off.

1101
01:25:49,111 --> 01:25:50,544
We're okay.

1102
01:25:50,946 --> 01:25:55,884
No wonder the damn thing's orbit is
decaying. lt's got to weigh 50 ton.

1103
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,645
Houston, this is Daedalus.
You see what we see?

1104
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:01,755
Roger, Daedalus. We are...

1105
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:04,255
...studying it from here.

1106
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,757
Stand by for a decision.

1107
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:13,799
lt's got to have some kind of
self-defense mechanism.

1108
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:16,699
Our radar must've activated it.

1109
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,101
Can you grab it?

1110
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:23,635
l can get it if Hawk
can get us in there.

1111
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:26,945
l'm just worried about the mass.

1112
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:29,811
l'm worried about this thing
getting pissed again.

1113
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,957
Does that look like a communications
satellite to you?

1114
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:43,620
General, what sort of modifications
have your people made here?

1115
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:49,466
That grappling arm can't
handle that much stress.

1116
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:53,100
lt's within operational limits.
Frank can latch on.

1117
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:54,833
l don't know about this.

1118
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:58,604
Our mission is to restore this
satellite. Let's get on with it.

1119
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:01,647
l won't let this crew get killed,
you included.

1120
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:10,117
Houston, Daedalus.
We're still standing by.

1121
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:15,630
-Give them a go to capture.
-Daedalus, this is Houston.

1122
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:18,027
You have a go for capture.

1123
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,395
-Here we go, gentlemen.
-Roger, Houston.

1124
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:24,863
We have a go for capture.
Pull it in, see what she looks like.

1125
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,201
Give me a minute to get it stable.

1126
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:00,032
Okay, how does that look?

1127
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:02,369
That's close enough for me.

1128
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:05,342
-ls he as good as you say he is?
-Tank?

1129
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:06,981
He's the man.

1130
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,016
All right. You can go for it.

1131
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,892
You're drifting left too far.

1132
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:26,026
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1133
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:32,033
Holy shit!
l got it!

1134
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:36,834
You the man, Tank.

1135
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,570
Houston, Daedalus. We've got lkon.

1136
01:28:40,849 --> 01:28:42,442
Good work, fellas.

1137
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:56,353
You boys look mighty sharp.

1138
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:39,496
Welcome to space, Frank.
You've waited a while for this.

1139
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:43,565
Yeah. Only 40 years.

1140
01:30:57,986 --> 01:31:01,854
All right, cowboys. Let's round
them up. We got work to do.

1141
01:31:52,107 --> 01:31:54,075
A little light on the subject.

1142
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:56,777
We'll take a look at its brains.

1143
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:02,577
l don't think that's the panel.

1144
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:04,779
You don't, do you?

1145
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:42,052
Holy cow, Frank.

1146
01:32:42,357 --> 01:32:45,520
This is some piece of junk.

1147
01:33:08,283 --> 01:33:11,343
This isn't a sightseeing trip, Frank.

1148
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:28,136
-Abort activity.
-Frank, listen to me.

1149
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:31,169
l said, abort activity. Now.

1150
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,383
What's going on, Frank?

1151
01:33:53,428 --> 01:33:56,454
Ethan, what the hell's going on?
What is this damn thing?

1152
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:59,133
A Russian communications satellite,
colonel.

1153
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:03,361
Bullshit! You don't think l know a
nuclear launch platform when l see it?

1154
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:07,064
Why are we helping the Russians
put a missile silo back into orbit?

1155
01:34:07,442 --> 01:34:09,604
You're a genius. You figure it out.

1156
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:14,315
You're only here
as a publicity stunt!

1157
01:34:14,616 --> 01:34:17,142
You got what you wanted!
You're in space!

1158
01:34:17,352 --> 01:34:19,377
Now finish the damn mission!

1159
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:25,958
Go ahead, Frank.

1160
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,356
You're on a secure line now.

1161
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:32,564
You were right to be concerned
about this thing coming out of orbit.

1162
01:34:32,767 --> 01:34:36,135
lt happens to have six armed
nuclear warheads on board.

1163
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,806
What's he talking about?

1164
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:42,636
l have no idea.

1165
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:45,336
General, is there something
you want to tell us?

1166
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:48,213
Yes.

1167
01:34:49,484 --> 01:34:52,715
lkon is a relic from the Cold War.

1168
01:34:53,288 --> 01:34:57,748
lt has floated dead in space
ever since the Soviet Union fell.

1169
01:34:58,493 --> 01:35:00,894
There are six missiles on board...

1170
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:04,657
...targeted at strategic
American installations.

1171
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:07,300
All, most regrettably...

1172
01:35:07,502 --> 01:35:09,129
...in large metropolitan areas.

1173
01:35:09,971 --> 01:35:11,598
lf lkon goes offline...

1174
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:13,498
...it will assume that...

1175
01:35:13,975 --> 01:35:18,310
...there has been a catastrophe
and will initiate launch on its own.

1176
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:21,641
You picked a hell of a time
for a confession, general.

1177
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:23,784
Those are our boys up there.

1178
01:35:23,985 --> 01:35:27,853
And that is a treaty violation.
A goddamn big one.

1179
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:29,751
You bastard.

1180
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:34,054
Bob, you don't know how touched l am
that you're worried about our safety.

1181
01:35:34,429 --> 01:35:37,159
Why don't you ask your friend
the general...

1182
01:35:37,365 --> 01:35:41,324
...how my guidance system from
Skylab got aboard this six-gun?

1183
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:46,064
lt was stolen by the KGB...

1184
01:35:46,274 --> 01:35:49,573
...from Mr. Gerson's personal files.

1185
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:56,110
This is all news to me.

1186
01:35:56,818 --> 01:36:01,346
You'd have us put it back into orbit
fully armed and keep it a secret...

1187
01:36:01,556 --> 01:36:03,319
...just to save your ass?

1188
01:36:05,927 --> 01:36:08,726
People, we have a real problem here.

1189
01:36:13,835 --> 01:36:14,995
All right, huddle up.

1190
01:36:15,303 --> 01:36:16,896
We got a big-ass problem.

1191
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:21,405
We're latched on to a 100-megaton
bomb traveling 17,000 miles an hour.

1192
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:28,004
What about that shit heap? You think
we can get it out into deep space?

1193
01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:31,618
Four payload assist rockets? Just.

1194
01:36:31,853 --> 01:36:35,084
Maybe. l don't know.
Let me crunch some numbers.

1195
01:36:41,062 --> 01:36:42,496
Just okay, Frank.

1196
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:47,358
Somebody's outside the ship.

1197
01:36:47,568 --> 01:36:51,801
Daedalus, you have an unscheduled
Eи you want to tell me about?

1198
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:53,968
What?

1199
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,917
He's jammed the air lock door, Frank.

1200
01:37:05,286 --> 01:37:07,311
Remove the panel and override it.

1201
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:13,985
Turn on the lights.

1202
01:37:17,265 --> 01:37:19,392
Ethan, what are you doing out there?

1203
01:37:23,438 --> 01:37:24,962
Ethan, what are you doing?

1204
01:37:25,273 --> 01:37:26,900
Your job, Frank.

1205
01:37:27,809 --> 01:37:30,005
Putting lkon back into geosync orbit.

1206
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:36,848
You don't know what you're doing.
Come back. That's an order.

1207
01:37:37,385 --> 01:37:39,717
You don't know the sequencing.

1208
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:45,582
Get suited up. When the door's fixed,
get out there.

1209
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:47,022
All right.

1210
01:37:56,971 --> 01:38:00,874
Ethan, do not connect those PAM
rockets. Do you understand?

1211
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:04,034
How long?

1212
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:05,269
l nearly got it.

1213
01:38:09,817 --> 01:38:12,377
Don't lock onto those PAM rockets.
You hear me?

1214
01:38:21,596 --> 01:38:22,586
Got it.

1215
01:38:52,527 --> 01:38:53,721
lt's arming itself.

1216
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:14,175
Oh, God!

1217
01:39:28,763 --> 01:39:30,094
Oh, Lord.

1218
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:47,304
-Hawk.
-l'm on it.

1219
01:40:36,664 --> 01:40:38,655
Shit, we got a fire in here.

1220
01:40:43,004 --> 01:40:44,597
We lost lkon and Ethan.

1221
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:53,943
Roger's hurt, mid-deck.
He's bleeding badly.

1222
01:40:54,515 --> 01:40:56,609
See what you can do for him.

1223
01:40:56,817 --> 01:41:00,345
Tank, contain the situation.
Kill the 02 switch.

1224
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:01,579
Killing it.

1225
01:41:01,756 --> 01:41:03,519
Hawk and l are going out.

1226
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:04,987
l got it.

1227
01:41:11,132 --> 01:41:13,123
Status GBC.

1228
01:41:13,701 --> 01:41:14,861
Check.

1229
01:41:15,102 --> 01:41:16,900
They've got the fire contained.

1230
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:20,165
Range, 100 feet. lt's accelerating,
Miss Holland.

1231
01:41:20,374 --> 01:41:22,172
They're gonna lose it.

1232
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:24,169
l assume you got a plan.

1233
01:41:24,378 --> 01:41:29,180
l think l can reconfigure the flight
control system for stabilization burn.

1234
01:41:29,383 --> 01:41:32,649
The only trouble is, l gotta do that
at exactly the right time.

1235
01:41:33,054 --> 01:41:34,521
That's where you come in.

1236
01:41:34,722 --> 01:41:36,850
You gotta be my eyes
while l'm in there.

1237
01:41:37,058 --> 01:41:40,721
Cue me when the satellite comes around
and lines up with the shuttle.

1238
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:43,522
But what about the rate of descent?

1239
01:41:43,731 --> 01:41:48,168
l'll fire a short burst from the PAM,
and that'll counter-thrust.

1240
01:41:48,369 --> 01:41:51,100
Just enable the PAM rocket
to accept my command.

1241
01:41:51,305 --> 01:41:53,797
Hell, l thought this
was gonna be hard.

1242
01:41:54,008 --> 01:41:55,737
Jerry, to make all this work...

1243
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:58,435
...give me range and rate
of opening readings.

1244
01:41:58,846 --> 01:42:01,338
Frank, you have one shot, maybe.

1245
01:42:01,549 --> 01:42:03,745
You miss, you'll never make it back.

1246
01:42:04,085 --> 01:42:07,487
lf those bombs hit the atmosphere,
it might not matter anyway.

1247
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:10,715
Come on, let's suit up
and get out of here.

1248
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:20,057
That's the craziest thing
l've ever heard.

1249
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:08,615
2200 feet.

1250
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:25,826
Holy cow. This is a bad idea.

1251
01:43:28,335 --> 01:43:31,430
Frank, by my calculations,
you got 15 seconds...

1252
01:43:31,639 --> 01:43:33,505
...to ignite that PAM.

1253
01:43:37,845 --> 01:43:40,974
-Speak to me, Hawk.
-We're almost there, Frank.

1254
01:43:43,784 --> 01:43:44,774
Five.

1255
01:43:44,985 --> 01:43:46,886
-On a count of one.
-Four.

1256
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:48,721
-One.
-Three.

1257
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:51,286
Two, one.

1258
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:30,558
On my mark, Frank, shut her down.

1259
01:44:39,507 --> 01:44:41,270
Five, four...

1260
01:44:41,776 --> 01:44:42,765
...three...

1261
01:44:42,977 --> 01:44:44,035
Come on, Frank.

1262
01:44:44,245 --> 01:44:46,111
...two, one...

1263
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,270
...mark.

1264
01:44:58,325 --> 01:45:00,089
That's it, Frank. lt's static.

1265
01:45:04,565 --> 01:45:07,398
Houston, this is Daedalus.
We've arrested the fall.

1266
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:08,932
Attaboy, Frank!

1267
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:10,866
Oh, thank God.

1268
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,403
Son of a bitch.

1269
01:45:27,254 --> 01:45:28,847
He's out.

1270
01:45:32,693 --> 01:45:36,823
l'll hook up the extra Payload Assist
Modules. You take Jonny Quest back.

1271
01:45:41,068 --> 01:45:44,163
We've got a problem.
We've only got one rocket left.

1272
01:45:45,139 --> 01:45:48,507
One PAM's got no chance of getting
that thing into orbit, Frank.

1273
01:45:54,481 --> 01:45:56,177
You got another problem.

1274
01:45:57,518 --> 01:46:00,578
Oh, no. Even if we get
this thing going...

1275
01:46:00,788 --> 01:46:04,486
...it's not gonna have enough power
with two broken panels.

1276
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:06,925
Take the kid back, l'll handle this.

1277
01:46:07,328 --> 01:46:10,764
How will you handle it, professor?
You're a pilot, remember?

1278
01:46:11,165 --> 01:46:14,294
l'll need all the extra O2 modules
you've got.

1279
01:46:15,669 --> 01:46:17,467
What are you talking about?

1280
01:46:20,808 --> 01:46:22,139
No.

1281
01:46:23,611 --> 01:46:26,876
l love you, but why do you
have to be such a killjoy?

1282
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:29,345
Besides, you ever see a prettier moon?

1283
01:46:34,955 --> 01:46:36,685
What's he talking about, Frank?

1284
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:44,031
You'd never make
a quarter of a million miles.

1285
01:46:44,231 --> 01:46:45,631
Oh, hell, yes, l will.

1286
01:46:45,833 --> 01:46:49,098
l just gotta go halfway.
The moon's gravity will do the rest.

1287
01:46:49,303 --> 01:46:52,068
l'll fire them into outer space
and let them...

1288
01:46:55,976 --> 01:46:57,603
...self-destruct.

1289
01:47:01,015 --> 01:47:05,953
That's not a solution, Frank. One PAM
rocket's not nearly enough thrust.

1290
01:47:06,153 --> 01:47:09,748
Let's everybody slow down.
There's got to be another way.

1291
01:47:10,157 --> 01:47:11,488
There isn't.

1292
01:47:12,293 --> 01:47:13,419
No.

1293
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:17,359
No.

1294
01:47:17,865 --> 01:47:21,324
Gotta be a winner in every race.
Looks like it's me this time.

1295
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:25,270
As usual, huh?

1296
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:27,739
Oh, shit.

1297
01:48:30,471 --> 01:48:32,769
-He can't do that.
-What's the status here?

1298
01:48:32,973 --> 01:48:34,771
What's the status here?

1299
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:38,534
One orbital engine gone,
primary and secondary guidance system.

1300
01:48:38,746 --> 01:48:41,146
Hydraulics are questionable.

1301
01:48:41,482 --> 01:48:42,506
Roger?

1302
01:48:43,784 --> 01:48:45,343
He has a concussion.

1303
01:48:46,754 --> 01:48:48,381
Oh, God.

1304
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:58,093
With no Roger and no Hawk, Frank...

1305
01:48:58,298 --> 01:49:00,597
...you'll have to pilot this bird
by yourself.

1306
01:49:00,801 --> 01:49:03,463
And you'll have to do it dead-stick.

1307
01:49:07,007 --> 01:49:11,206
Don't look at me. l've flown nothing
bigger than a Cessna in 30 years.

1308
01:49:13,847 --> 01:49:17,044
Looks like l'm getting the better part
of the deal here.

1309
01:49:18,852 --> 01:49:22,015
Stop laughing.
You used up all your oxygen, dummy.

1310
01:49:45,145 --> 01:49:46,738
Frank's hot-wired it for you...

1311
01:49:46,947 --> 01:49:51,475
...but the trick is, those missiles
run out of fuel in 20,000 miles.

1312
01:49:51,752 --> 01:49:53,413
You launch them too soon...

1313
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:56,556
...the warheads could find
their way back home to Earth.

1314
01:49:56,757 --> 01:50:01,126
Too late, they'd run out of fuel
and then you'd be stuck with them.

1315
01:50:02,663 --> 01:50:03,994
ls this gonna work?

1316
01:50:06,633 --> 01:50:07,657
l don't know.

1317
01:50:08,469 --> 01:50:09,663
All right, fellas...

1318
01:50:10,204 --> 01:50:12,331
...let's shoot this baby to the moon.

1319
01:50:15,075 --> 01:50:16,770
Count down to one, right?

1320
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,778
On a count of one.

1321
01:50:38,031 --> 01:50:39,624
One.

1322
01:51:37,124 --> 01:51:39,092
lkon has left our gravitational field.

1323
01:51:39,293 --> 01:51:43,127
Hawk was able to launch the warheads
into outer space.

1324
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:44,855
How's Daedalus?

1325
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:47,762
We have a critical situation.

1326
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:53,404
The collision left us with one good
orbital maneuvering engine...

1327
01:51:53,607 --> 01:51:55,666
...and it's leaking fuel.

1328
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:59,309
lf there's not enough fuel
for a de-orbit burn....

1329
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:02,540
lt'll burn up, or it'll skip off.

1330
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:05,374
What about guidance and avionics?

1331
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:08,516
Well, the computers are unresponsive.

1332
01:52:08,922 --> 01:52:12,757
The only thing operating
at 100 percent is their air flow.

1333
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:18,528
They're gonna have to reenter the
atmosphere and set her down in manual.

1334
01:52:18,732 --> 01:52:22,498
-That's impossible.
-Well, it's never happened before.

1335
01:52:24,638 --> 01:52:29,007
The only pilots alive who'd even think
about it are Roger and Hawk.

1336
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:32,843
-Roger's wounded and Hawk's--
-Okay.

1337
01:52:33,847 --> 01:52:36,839
Let's get them as close as we can,
then abort the landing.

1338
01:52:37,451 --> 01:52:41,387
They'll have to bail out.
What are the survival probabilities?

1339
01:52:43,957 --> 01:52:45,891
20 percent at best.

1340
01:52:46,093 --> 01:52:50,393
Zero if they try to set it down.
The bird's dead.

1341
01:52:51,098 --> 01:52:54,431
l doubt it would even glide,
with its structural damage.

1342
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:59,002
20 percent is better than zero.

1343
01:53:14,087 --> 01:53:18,786
-You still have that thing?
-Yes. She'll dance all the way home.

1344
01:53:24,097 --> 01:53:25,087
Daedalus.

1345
01:53:25,399 --> 01:53:27,663
Stand by for Eugene Davis.

1346
01:53:30,037 --> 01:53:32,528
The judgement here is to go for Florida.

1347
01:53:33,774 --> 01:53:36,243
We'll get you as close to Kennedy
as we can.

1348
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:40,807
Now, you're still inverted.
And you're flying tail-first.

1349
01:53:41,415 --> 01:53:45,408
Ordinarily, the autopilot would
do a de-orbit burn to right you.

1350
01:53:46,286 --> 01:53:49,950
-But we don't have a computer, right?
-That's right.

1351
01:53:50,757 --> 01:53:53,886
You don't have much fuel left
in that engine, either.

1352
01:53:54,995 --> 01:53:56,428
Swell.

1353
01:53:56,697 --> 01:53:58,995
Stand by for de-orbit burn.

1354
01:54:12,245 --> 01:54:15,909
That wasn't enough. Flip us around
and use the forward RCS prop.

1355
01:54:16,116 --> 01:54:17,345
Shit.

1356
01:54:17,918 --> 01:54:19,215
All right.

1357
01:54:33,667 --> 01:54:34,930
Shit.

1358
01:54:35,569 --> 01:54:38,937
Easy, Frank. She's not a fighter jet.

1359
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:41,640
A flying brick.

1360
01:54:42,743 --> 01:54:44,176
l hope not.

1361
01:55:03,563 --> 01:55:05,793
l'm gonna put her in a steep dive.

1362
01:55:06,133 --> 01:55:08,192
Make sure we don't overshoot.

1363
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,271
l'll make a series of tight turns.

1364
01:55:16,476 --> 01:55:18,672
Spill off some of this speed.

1365
01:55:19,346 --> 01:55:24,045
Jerry, clip everybody in. At about
10,000, we should be over Florida.

1366
01:55:24,251 --> 01:55:26,378
Pop the hatch and get
everybody out of here.

1367
01:55:27,053 --> 01:55:28,419
Ethan and Roger first.

1368
01:55:29,022 --> 01:55:31,218
Tank, you and Jerry after that.

1369
01:55:31,424 --> 01:55:35,191
l'll line her up for a ditch over
the ocean. You got that, everyone?

1370
01:55:45,172 --> 01:55:46,833
Come on, hold together.

1371
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:49,202
You're going in too steep, Frank.

1372
01:55:52,579 --> 01:55:54,377
She'll fall apart around us.

1373
01:55:54,581 --> 01:55:56,549
Hold together just a little longer.

1374
01:56:16,736 --> 01:56:20,070
Altitude 30 miles over Texas.

1375
01:56:31,551 --> 01:56:33,417
Come on, just a little longer.

1376
01:56:37,257 --> 01:56:39,157
Give me one more turn.

1377
01:57:00,614 --> 01:57:02,104
He's trying to call, sir.

1378
01:57:02,482 --> 01:57:04,416
He's fried his antenna.

1379
01:57:04,885 --> 01:57:06,250
Trajectory, where is he?

1380
01:57:06,453 --> 01:57:09,650
He's on final, but way too hot.
He'll overshoot at this rate.

1381
01:57:18,765 --> 01:57:20,756
Coming up on 12,000.

1382
01:57:22,235 --> 01:57:23,362
Equalizing.

1383
01:57:24,404 --> 01:57:27,669
Jerry, blow that hatch.
Get everybody out of here.

1384
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:29,171
Roger.

1385
01:57:29,643 --> 01:57:30,667
Blowing the hatch.

1386
01:57:43,857 --> 01:57:45,484
One gone.

1387
01:57:45,659 --> 01:57:47,525
Tank, you get going too.

1388
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:49,351
What about you?

1389
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:51,827
l'll line her up for a visual,
then l'm out.

1390
01:57:55,902 --> 01:57:57,529
Two gone.

1391
01:57:58,438 --> 01:58:01,567
Get out of here. Do you hear me?
Get moving.

1392
01:58:05,545 --> 01:58:07,138
What the hell you guys doing?

1393
01:58:07,347 --> 01:58:09,247
We're a team, Frank.

1394
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:12,150
Get out of here. That's an order.

1395
01:58:12,752 --> 01:58:14,379
We're staying.

1396
01:58:16,856 --> 01:58:18,586
Read out my airspeed, then.

1397
01:58:19,659 --> 01:58:22,322
500. Bring her up.

1398
01:58:27,267 --> 01:58:30,032
This is Recover Five.
You're way too hot.

1399
01:58:30,203 --> 01:58:31,193
Pull out now.

1400
01:58:31,771 --> 01:58:32,898
Negative, Recover.

1401
01:58:35,508 --> 01:58:36,874
All right, give me airspeed.

1402
01:58:38,511 --> 01:58:39,843
300. Gear coming.

1403
01:58:40,513 --> 01:58:41,708
Gear down.

1404
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:46,442
All right, there's nothing to this.
Just tap the brakes a little bit.

1405
01:58:54,728 --> 01:58:56,093
He's gone into a stall.

1406
01:59:04,471 --> 01:59:05,461
Airspeed?

1407
01:59:05,805 --> 01:59:07,171
220.

1408
01:59:07,874 --> 01:59:08,864
210.

1409
01:59:10,076 --> 01:59:11,305
200.

1410
01:59:11,878 --> 01:59:14,404
185. She's gonna stall, Frank.

1411
01:59:18,885 --> 01:59:19,909
Speed?

1412
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,750
175. Drop the nose.

1413
01:59:22,989 --> 01:59:25,287
What do you say we drop the nose?

1414
02:00:11,805 --> 02:00:15,298
Wheels stopped. Daedalus is home.

1415
02:00:31,491 --> 02:00:33,550
Just a walk in the park, Frank.

1416
02:01:03,123 --> 02:01:04,454
Hey, Gene.

1417
02:01:05,492 --> 02:01:07,824
-Yeah?
-Never mind.

1418
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:12,561
l never doubted Frank Corvin
for a minute.

1419
02:01:13,433 --> 02:01:17,062
l brought him in on Project Daedalus
40 years ago and on this one too.

1420
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:21,173
l'll tell you this: For commitment,
courage and consistency...

1421
02:01:21,374 --> 02:01:24,537
...this group blows away
all the teams l've ever had.

1422
02:01:36,589 --> 02:01:38,319
Do you think he made it?

1423
02:01:44,164 --> 02:01:46,894
Yeah. l think he made it.

1424
02:01:54,274 --> 02:01:57,107
Fly me to the moon

1425
02:01:57,310 --> 02:02:02,077
Let me play among the stars

1426
02:02:02,282 --> 02:02:06,617
Let me see what spring is like

1427
02:02:07,253 --> 02:02:09,984
On Jupiter and Mars

1428
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:12,291
ln other words

1429
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:17,353
Hold my hand

1430
02:02:18,464 --> 02:02:20,399
ln other words

1431
02:02:21,534 --> 02:02:24,197
Baby, kiss me

1432
02:02:26,573 --> 02:02:29,098
Fill my heart with song

1433
02:02:29,309 --> 02:02:33,712
And let me sing forevermore

1434
02:02:34,714 --> 02:02:37,684
You are all l long for

1435
02:02:37,884 --> 02:02:41,843
All l worship and adore
