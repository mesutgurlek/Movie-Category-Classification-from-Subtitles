1
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,879
Mr. Director, this is
Agent Vivian Delay.

2
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,679
For the last ten years, the
Central Intelligence Agency

3
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,559
- has been after Wolfgang Braun.
- The Wolf.

4
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,199
As you know, we have no positive
identification on what the Wolf looks like.

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,039
What we do know is he's a
former German national

6
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,519
who sells atomic material to
terrorists all over the world.

7
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,279
Intelligence confirms that a
transaction is to take place

8
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,999
next week in Belgrade.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,879
The Wolf's number one
man, the Albino,

10
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,367
will be selling a dirty
bomb to Syrian buyers.

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,919
<i>We've already dispatched a
team to eliminate the buyers,</i>

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,885
<i>secure the bomb, and
apprehend the Albino.</i>

13
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,079
How may I be of service, sir?

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,248
Your target is the Wolf.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,686
We have reason to believe
he'll be present.

16
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,719
Find him and eliminate him.

17
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,159
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,250
Let them get the Albino,
you get the Wolf.

19
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,159
Oh, sir, if I may,

20
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,442
who is our agent on the ground?

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,999
<i>Ethan Renner.</i>

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,239
<i>He's a lifer.</i>

23
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,090
<i>He'll get the job done.</i>

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,767
The buyers have been neutralized.

25
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,319
Well done, Ethan. Well done.

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,010
<i>Going down.</i>

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,601
Maid service. I have
your extra towels.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,199
This cold is killing me.

29
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,279
- Yeah?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

30
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,528
- You left a big mess.
<i>- Yeah, well...</i>

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,519
I'm thinking about calling in sick.

32
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,610
<i>Come on, you haven't had
a sick day in 32 years.</i>

33
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,761
- Here's the scanner.
- Thank you, Yasmin.

34
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,009
Uh... be sure to stock my bedroom with
those little shampoo bottles, I like them.

35
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,844
All teams in position.

36
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,924
Excuse me.

37
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,360
Nice work in there, my man.

38
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,759
Oh... it's Zooey's birthday.

39
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,199
I need a second to make a call.

40
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,119
Cell phones aren't secure, Ethan.

41
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,279
Yeah, well, it's my daughter.

42
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,165
You've got a payphone outside,
you've got five minutes.

43
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,401
Let's see the scan.

44
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,079
Hey, hey, listen I'm trying to
make a phone call over there and

45
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,999
I don't have any change so if I could
borrow some out of this money.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I can come back and
I can pay you back.

47
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,159
Come on, come on.

48
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
Son of a bitch.

49
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,319
All right, this is worth a lot.

50
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,806
I take some of this.

51
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,245
I'm coming back for that.

52
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,848
Excuse me.

53
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,729
Have we met before?

54
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,530
You would remember me, no?

55
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,203
Karachi!

56
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,319
Yasmin's been compromised.
We need to move now, Axel!

57
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,199
No one moves on the Albino

58
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,399
until we have cleared
what's in the box. Come on.

59
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,519
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We met in
Karachi last April exactly.

60
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,719
But then you were working
as a cocktail waitress

61
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,241
if I remember it correctly?

62
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,479
- Oh, shit.
- We got confirmation.

63
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,886
That's a dirty bomb.

64
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,759
<i>Boss.</i>

65
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,008
<i>Abort.</i>

66
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,599
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hi sweetie, it's your father.

67
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,559
<i>You didn't forget, which
means you probably love me.</i>

68
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,959
Of course I do, Zooey.

69
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,919
<i>You can prove it by singing me
"Happy Birthday, " loudly.</i>

70
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,199
Well, I could sweetheart,
but, uh, I'm at work.

71
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,759
<i>You can leave a message
after the beep.</i>

72
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,970
What the f...?

73
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,679
All right.

74
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,679
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

75
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,881
<i>♪ Happy birth...</i>

76
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,569
Go, go! Get in position! Cover me!

77
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,246
<i>♪ ...to you</i>

78
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,644
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Zooey</i>

79
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,644
Cover Ethan now!

80
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,321
We're going in! We're going in!

81
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,084
Cover Ethan! Cover Ethan!

82
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,159
All right, that's enough.

83
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,524
Put it down.

84
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,686
Now.

85
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,999
Now slide it over here.

86
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,079
You're not going to
kill me, are you?

87
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,959
Not unless I have to, all right?

88
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,479
But I'm not running after
you anymore, fucker.

89
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,566
Ohh...

90
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,559
I see you've read the report.

91
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,599
- It's called Glioblastoma.
- Yeah.

92
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,839
It's a type of brain cancer and
it's spread to your lungs.

93
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,008
It doesn't say how
much time I have left.

94
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,959
Three months, possibly five.

95
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,367
Yeah.

96
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,359
So, no Christmas this year, huh?

97
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,399
I'm afraid not.

98
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,879
I suggest you put your
affairs in order.

99
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,809
Thank you, doctor.

100
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,919
Well done securing the bomb, Ethan.

101
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,519
But now that you're no
longer operational,

102
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,281
we need to terminate
our relationship.

103
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,839
We've wired your pension
into your account.

104
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,646
The CIA thanks you
for your service.

105
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,201
What the...?

106
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,159
- What are you doing in my place?
- You do not speak French?

107
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,091
No, I'm American. I...

108
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,799
- I live here.
- Which floor?

109
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,559
No, I mean, I live here.

110
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,359
You? You are the owner?

111
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,244
I'm so happy to finally meet you.

112
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,239
<i>Bonjour, mon ami.</i>

113
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,279
This is my wife, Teresa.
My son Abbate.

114
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,319
My daughter Sumia is in the
kitchen, she's pregnant.

115
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,999
These are my cousins.
They are visiting us from Mali.

116
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,919
Until they go to stay with
my brother in Saint-Denis.

117
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,966
- Do you know Saint Denis?
- No, I don't know Saint Denis.

118
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,759
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- We were without a home.

119
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,119
We were seeking shelter.
You are lucky we're here.

120
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,199
- Bad spirit fill empty spaces.
- Yeah, but now I'm back.

121
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,559
And it is good that you are
finally back. My name is Jules.

122
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,250
Ethan.

123
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,919
Where's all my stuff?

124
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,879
I also started to paint the room.

125
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,159
My wife think it is best
to have a cheerful color.

126
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,759
Is yellow good for you? I'm happy to do
the work. It's not a problem, Ethan.

127
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,566
Actually, Jules,
there is a problem.

128
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,605
That's months from now.

129
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,159
Then I guess I need to
throw them out myself.

130
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,886
No, no, no, hey, ho.

131
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,599
I'll go to... Hey! I'll go to jail?

132
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,207
All right, what exactly
then am I supposed to do?

133
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,959
Did you really just say that to me?

134
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,644
Ethan, Ethan!

135
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,639
I need to talk to your dad.

136
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,319
Psst!

137
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,841
Please give me a minute
to finish my call.

138
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,846
- I'm sorry, Ethan.
- Let's talk in private, Jules, in my room.

139
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,999
I can assure you, we have not
touched any of your things.

140
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,159
I'm not saying you did, but
I think it's time you and I

141
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,479
got to know each other
just a little better.

142
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,049
'Cause you're not just
crashing at some guy's house.

143
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,451
No problem, Ethan. We
will pack and leave now.

144
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,850
Where are you gonna go
with a pregnant kid?

145
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,639
I don't know, but we'll
leave without packing.

146
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,171
Sit down.

147
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,639
You don't have to go
yet, Jules, at least...

148
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,446
not until your
daughter has her baby.

149
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,759
But you stay under my rules.

150
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,879
- I am also a believer in rules.
- Rule #1, no one steps in this room again.

151
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,439
No one. Absolutely.
I'll put a bigger sign.

152
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,199
That's right, you
put a bigger sign.

153
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,319
Rule #2, you always do what
I say, no questions asked.

154
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,439
Yes, of course.

155
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,359
And rule #3, you don't
ever paint my room again.

156
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,359
- You don't like the color?
- No.

157
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,359
I told my wife yellow
is not a man's color.

158
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,961
No, yellow is not a man's color.

159
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,239
- So you also have a daughter?
- Yes.

160
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,205
Like Sumia.

161
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,519
OK, OK, no more yellow.

162
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,879
<i>Who is the most beautiful
girl in the world?</i>

163
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,599
<i>- Is that you?
- Look, Daddy!</i>

164
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,879
<i>That is so cute!</i>

165
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,804
<i>Run, run, run!</i>

166
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,279
Hey, <i>salut</i>, Christine.

167
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,164
Hi, you.

168
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,763
Hey.

169
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,119
- This is Christine.
- Hello, Tina. It's me.

170
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,731
I'm in town.

171
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,687
I'm in a meeting right now, so
this is not a good time to talk.

172
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,359
I don't want to talk.
I want to see you.

173
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,679
Yeah, I'm exceptionally busy,

174
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,479
so, uh... unless it's urgent

175
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,439
I've got some legal stuff I need you
to look at before I leave town.

176
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,971
Why?

177
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,759
- Are you getting married?
- No, why, are you?

178
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,199
No, not today.

179
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,085
All right, I'll meet you outside.

180
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,890
OK, see ya.

181
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,519
Why are we really here, Ethan?

182
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,324
I wanted to see you.

183
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,199
And our daughter, you
want to see her too?

184
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,006
Yes. Yes.

185
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,999
I started a college fund.

186
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,999
Why the sudden interest?

187
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,439
It's not sudden, Tina.
I try to stay in touch.

188
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,449
I left her a message
on her birthday.

189
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,999
Yes, and now she'll have to wait
another year to hear from you again.

190
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,799
I'm dying, Tina.

191
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,527
- You think this is easy for me?
- No, I'm...

192
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,411
I'm sick.

193
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,639
I mean, I'm dying.

194
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,759
Sorry it took so long,
but I'm afraid your will

195
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,203
must be signed in both
French and English.

196
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,767
<i>I don't want Zooey to know,
at least not right away.</i>

197
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,441
Come on in.

198
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,439
It's nice.

199
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,119
The place looks better than before.

200
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,159
Don't look too hard.
It's falling apart.

201
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,011
I know I haven't done
right by you and Zooey.

202
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,487
I want to see her before I go.

203
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,528
You have to make me a promise.

204
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,806
I'll let you see her
under one condition.

205
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,201
Are you done?

206
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,439
Are you really done
working for them?

207
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,564
- Yes.
- Promise me.

208
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,607
Yes. I missed a lot.

209
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,719
I should have left a long time ago.

210
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,599
I'm gonna be fine.

211
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,279
I've got the whole
day planned. First...

212
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,159
Oh, no, no, sweetheart, no.
She has her own plans.

213
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,559
You'll just have to catch up.
Hi, sweetie!

214
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,489
Hi.

215
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,566
Hi, Zooey.

216
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,560
How are you?

217
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,759
I'm good, how are you?

218
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,769
I'm good, thank you.

219
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,599
- OK.
- Mom, please don't cry. I'm fine.

220
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,119
No, I'm just... I'll be
back home at 8:30. Yeah?

221
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,719
What are we supposed to do?

222
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,604
All right, how about I cook?

223
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,766
You're on.

224
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,203
So you want me to call you Dad
or should I just call you Ethan?

225
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,770
I think I like Dad.

226
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,519
Favorite place to go after school?

227
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,399
I didn't know we had
a favorite place.

228
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,959
Flying chairs, remember?

229
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,079
Look, Ethan, we don't need
to do this, all right?

230
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,719
I know you probably want to talk
and get to know each other.

231
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,119
That's why I transferred
back here to Paris.

232
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,399
Look, I'm not mad
at you, all right?

233
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,079
I don't need you to explain any of
this, all right? It's not a big deal.

234
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,839
Come on, Zoe, let's go to the cafe.

235
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,679
Hugh, I want you to meet Ethan.

236
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,159
Who?

237
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,045
- I'm Zooey's father.
- Oh! Hello.

238
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,806
No.

239
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,199
Well, great to meet you,
Ethan... Mr. Renner.

240
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,879
Sorry, sometimes I
just get a bit nervous

241
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,319
when I see American cowboys.

242
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,799
Yee-haw!

243
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,331
OK.

244
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,199
He's older than you.

245
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,839
Yeah, he's a senior.

246
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,159
Is there something wrong with that?

247
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,399
Back when I was
growing up if you...

248
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,239
Hugh is so different than you.

249
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,239
Look, I know I'm blowing
it here, Zooey, I...

250
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,279
Look, I...

251
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,244
thought you might want
to ride this home.

252
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,039
- Wow, is this for me?
- Yeah.

253
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,839
It's... so purple.

254
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,439
Yeah, it's your favorite color.

255
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,880
Right, when I was like nine.

256
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:13,119
I'm taking the metro
with my friends.

257
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,121
All right, so I'll see
you at home for dinner?

258
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,362
Zooey, I'll see you
at home for dinner?

259
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,999
- How are these?
- Fresh.

260
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,359
They're fresh? I just need
to steam them, right?

261
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,121
Don't forget to soak it in milk.

262
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,239
Milk?

263
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,329
Only if you plan to fry it.

264
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,890
Haven't got that far.

265
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,599
I like a man that doesn't pretend
to know his way around the kitchen.

266
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,199
Yeah, well, you're talking
to the right guy.

267
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,401
Yes...

268
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,210
I think I am.

269
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,559
Well, I'm soaking tuna in milk and

270
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,279
thanks to you, frying
it for my daughter.

271
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,802
So today is Zooey's lucky day?

272
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,319
What did you say your name was?

273
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,719
You can call me Vivi.

274
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,730
Nice running into you,
Vivi, but not interested.

275
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,011
Maybe we could talk?

276
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,769
My wife gave me this.

277
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,243
Come on, cheri,
let's go for a drive.

278
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,328
All right, but my
bike's coming with me.

279
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,044
The bike's going with me.

280
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,479
Who exactly do you work for, Vivi?

281
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,799
I work for the director of the CIA.

282
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,879
Wouldn't know about the top shelf.

283
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,319
Serbia was my operation.

284
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,851
I was looking for the Wolf.

285
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,039
We believe he was at
the hotel that day,

286
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,519
and I believe that you
may have seen him.

287
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,799
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm willing to bet

288
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,685
that when you see him again
you'll recognize him.

289
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,039
I want you to come work for me.

290
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,559
Not a chance.
I've already got plans.

291
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,959
Don't you think Zooey deserves
to have her daddy around

292
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,527
for more than just a
few measly months?

293
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,447
Jesus!

294
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,001
That was really close.

295
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,010
In exchange for your cleaning services,
I could offer you an experimental drug.

296
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,519
Interested?

297
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,963
This, Ethan,
could extend your life.

298
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,800
Where's the literature?

299
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,491
You know, the test results.

300
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,799
How come no one's told
me about this before?

301
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,519
Because you weren't worth
the cost of treatment.

302
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,879
Wow. You make me feel so special.

303
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,731
- You weren't. But now you are.
- Why?

304
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,599
Because you're sick and dead
men have nothing to lose.

305
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,999
I have access to
many things, Ethan,

306
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,328
but only you can give
me access to the Wolf.

307
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,005
I need you to find him...

308
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,039
and I need you to kill him.

309
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,599
So I buy back my life
by killing for you?

310
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,799
When did you become
so self-righteous?

311
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,759
Jesus Christ, I just wanna be sure that
we're talking about the same thing here.

312
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,847
You know, killing.

313
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,479
There's a man inside that works
for the Wolf's accountant.

314
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,250
I'm gonna need you
to start right away.

315
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,999
Well, I got a fish
to fry and I'm late.

316
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,646
I can get you in home in
time for dinner, Ethan.

317
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,365
Question is...

318
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,442
do you want your bike back?

319
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,199
- Pretty public place.
- Meaning?

320
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,050
Meaning a silencer would...

321
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,050
be handy.

322
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,559
So, how many guys are
we talking about?

323
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,841
One.

324
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,159
Knock 'em dead.

325
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,284
Yeah, well, that's
the point, isn't it?

326
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,803
<i>Allo?</i>

327
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,640
Grenade!

328
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,285
Pretty good for a jobber.

329
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,559
You said there'd be
one guy, not five.

330
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,159
Oops.

331
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,879
But I did say keep the young
man with the mustache alive.

332
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,679
What do you think
this guy looks like?

333
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,999
- Middle-aged.
- Not a chance.

334
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,479
- Tell her how old you are.
- I am...

335
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,319
Make an effort, all right?
I'm trying to save your life.

336
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,966
- Now tell her how old you are.
- I'm 32.

337
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,331
- Middle-aged.
- Jesus Christ!

338
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,719
Now this...

339
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,239
is a young man with a mustache.

340
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,599
No, that's a goatee.

341
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,167
That's a mustache and some stubble.

342
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,799
- That's a goatee.
- That's a goatee?

343
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,519
That's a mustache, all right?
This is a goatee.

344
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,839
- That's a shadow.
- It looks French.

345
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,279
- Since when?
- That's a goatee...

346
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,959
What, from your century, grandpa?

347
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,519
Look at that, that's a mustache.

348
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,559
All right, so what about
the rest of these guys?

349
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,159
- Hmm?
- Oh, my...

350
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,039
Who are all these other guys here?

351
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,319
- I don't know.
- And that doesn't bother you?

352
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,719
Nope.

353
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,959
Because I usually like to know the
person I'm killing needs to be dead.

354
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,560
And that's why you never made
it to the top shelf, my friend.

355
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,839
Goatee, you're up.

356
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,239
I'm looking for the accountant.
When does he get back to Paris?

357
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,568
I don't know, I swear.

358
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,959
Kill him.

359
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,359
Hold on, I can get
this guy to talk.

360
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,841
He didn't know.

361
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,088
Goddamn it.

362
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,999
Do you even have a line
that can't be crossed?

363
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,799
I'm gonna need a significant raise.

364
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,959
I wanna leave my daughter more
than just my shit pension.

365
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,959
Look, I'll close at 25 but I'm gonna
cap you to half a dozen kills.

366
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,599
Half a dozen?

367
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,599
I'm already halfway there.

368
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,167
We've all been asked
to tighten our belts.

369
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,399
Don't take this the wrong way,
Viv, but you're not my type.

370
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,731
I'm everybody's type.

371
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,319
- You... Are you sure this works?
- No.

372
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,444
But I am sure that if you don't try
it, you'll be dead in two months.

373
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,359
It's 50 thousand, not 25.

374
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,281
And you're giving me credit for
those three guys upstairs.

375
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,599
And I'm also gonna want a...

376
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,359
I'm gonna need a million
dollar life insurance policy.

377
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,679
Take it or leave it.

378
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,564
I'll take it.

379
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,130
I like the package.

380
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,206
All right, now do it.

381
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,126
Breathe, Ethan.

382
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,168
It will hit you morphine-quick.

383
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,846
One way or another...

384
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,409
I will make you feel better.

385
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,202
Don't forget to soak the fish.

386
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,839
You promised me my bike.

387
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,121
Zooey!

388
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,046
- Zooey! Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.

389
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,451
Look at this.

390
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,644
This looks terrible.

391
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,359
I think your... Your hair?

392
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,319
No, no. Yes. Yes, my hair.

393
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,079
I look like a freaking Chia Pet.

394
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,479
It looks, uh, awesome.

395
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,839
- Really?
- Yeah.

396
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,559
You think this can go to prom?

397
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,679
Well, if you're going you might
as well take it with you.

398
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,319
- Oh, is that some kind of joke?
- No, no, I mean...

399
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,399
All these times, now's
the time to say a joke?

400
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,090
No, I mean, maybe...

401
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,279
- Maybe we can fix your hair.
- Fix it? You can fix this?

402
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,639
No, you can... You could wash it...

403
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,359
You could sleep on it and,
look, tomorrow it will be...

404
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,799
It'll be back to normal,
all right? Maybe?

405
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,879
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

406
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,959
Why don't we pick up some dinner?

407
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,645
Hey. Don't offer to cook dinner if
you're going to be three hours late.

408
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,119
Look, I'm sorry, Tina, but I was...

409
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,529
Save it. I was crazy to
think I could count on you.

410
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,999
I was gonna ask you to look after
Zooey while I go to London for work.

411
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,239
Then, go.

412
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,319
Really, you should
go, I can handle it.

413
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,319
You can't handle dinner. How are
you gonna handle a teenager?

414
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,208
How about I just diffused a
major meltdown. Her hair, OK?

415
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,799
I have to take the first
flight out tomorrow morning.

416
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,286
I'm calling a sitter.

417
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,089
I was late because I found
a doctor who can help me.

418
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,079
- What?
- There's, um...

419
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,599
There's a specialist
here in Paris who has

420
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,531
a experimental drug she's
willing to test on me.

421
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,520
Experimental.

422
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,199
What exactly does that mean?

423
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,325
It means I might be able to spend a
little more time with you and Zooey.

424
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,960
You should have called, Ethan,
because I was going to kill you.

425
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,199
Can we just, like, maybe
quit fighting for a second.

426
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,479
Maybe not talk about
killing someone? Me.

427
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,639
I could grill us up
some of this tuna.

428
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,399
- Tuna?
- Yeah.

429
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,728
- Tuna.
- With all that mercury?

430
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,561
No way!

431
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,439
You're gonna fix that door, right?

432
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,688
Oh. Um...

433
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,199
Yeah, that was a mistake.

434
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,402
You haven't been here 24 hours.

435
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,609
I hope the sofa is going
to be comfortable.

436
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,563
Yeah. Better than a cot in Karachi.

437
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,688
Do you need something
to help you sleep?

438
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,409
Yeah, I'm gonna need it now.

439
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,281
You're terrible.

440
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,599
<i>I knew you would call.</i>

441
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,199
What the hell did you give me?

442
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,999
- You're not coming over?
- No. I'm dizzy.

443
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,443
My head... My head's dizzy.

444
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,759
Vivi.

445
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,921
- Read the manual.
- Wait! I'm hallucinating.

446
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,999
I'm hallucinating.

447
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,919
<i>- Take a shot of vodka.</i>
- What?

448
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,600
Vodka. It'll take the edge off.

449
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,526
Is everything OK?

450
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,086
Yeah.

451
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,282
- I had a little trouble finding the vodka.
- Huh.

452
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,719
Listen, you can call
me anytime you want.

453
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,399
It's only a one hour difference
between Paris and London.

454
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,679
- There you are.
- And you can call me, too.

455
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,479
- I love you.
- All right.

456
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,839
I'll be back in a couple
of days, I'm running late.

457
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,039
- Your daddy has a list.
- Kind of a big list.

458
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,679
- Washing powder...
- I'll see you guys!

459
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,639
- Have fun!
- ...for black clothes.

460
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,241
Zooey, come on, breakfast.

461
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,879
Look at me. Come on.

462
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,289
Just one time up here. One time.

463
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,041
Atta girl.

464
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,241
Zooey!

465
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,119
Oh.

466
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,479
What?

467
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,639
Wow, it's...

468
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,559
- It's what?
- Geez.

469
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,366
- So, what, Ethan?
- It's...

470
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,319
It's so red.

471
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,090
Vivi?

472
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,079
Are you going to get that?

473
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,039
Sorry. Nobody important,
just my boss, Vivi.

474
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,319
Was she the one calling you
in the middle of the night?

475
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,319
We talk a lot because we
sell internationally.

476
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,799
It's always daytime somewhere.

477
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,039
All right, so now we've
got three days to kill.

478
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,279
What are you doing?

479
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,999
It's called a ringtone, Ethan.

480
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,679
I'm giving you mine.

481
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,769
Maybe we can talk more
than once a year.

482
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,528
There. Welcome to this century.

483
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,887
Zooey. Zooey.

484
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,284
Don't you want to ride
your bike to school?

485
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,919
You think Hugh's gonna
like my hair color?

486
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,519
Yes, I do.

487
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,879
- Really?
- Yes.

488
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,879
- You think he'll really love it?
- Well, if he cares about you he will.

489
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,759
So you don't love it?

490
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,039
No.

491
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,359
No, I mean, yes, Zooey.

492
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,325
Zooey, I really love it.

493
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,369
Awesome.

494
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,359
I can see you don't
believe in the customary

495
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,879
forty-eight-hour
window between kills.

496
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,479
Well, you only have
three days left.

497
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,199
I'm not getting into
your car, Vivi.

498
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,239
Not until I get a second opinion on
that whatever it was you gave me.

499
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,999
- I told you it's kosher.
- No, it's not.

500
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,599
- Aw.
- The manual says,

501
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,719
if you'd bothered to read it,

502
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,079
you'd find out if I can't
keep my heart rate lower,

503
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,119
that shit's gonna act
like a hallucinogen.

504
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,079
So keep your heart rate low.

505
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,851
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard
with the job you got me doing.

506
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,360
Get in the car already.

507
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,879
I need you to locate
the Italian accountant

508
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,287
who cooks the books for
your old friend the Albino.

509
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,519
How am I supposed
to locate this guy?

510
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,199
With the help of this man.
His name is Mitat Yilmaz.

511
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,131
He runs a limo service
that caters to the Albino.

512
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,559
Get to know him, he'll lead you
straight to the accountant.

513
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,559
All right.

514
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,199
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah?

515
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,799
Lose the bike.

516
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,129
- Buy a suit.
- Why?

517
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,079
So, you understand we are
a luxury car service, right?

518
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,279
- Yeah.
- How did you come to hear of us?

519
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,641
An Albino told me.

520
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,839
Did he also tell you that
we offer discreet luxury?

521
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,959
He told me not to talk to the
hired help, to talk to the boss.

522
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,079
We're not the help, OK? We are the
executive vice president of sales.

523
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,089
Ooohh!

524
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,445
You're a couple of turds.

525
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,679
Listen, asshole...

526
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,559
little piece of turd,
you're nobody to us.

527
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,559
And you will never meet
the boss. Understand?

528
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,761
All right, I'm sorry.

529
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,679
Yeah.

530
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,119
I had a really weird
night, you know,

531
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,399
a couple of weird nights.
Jetlagged.

532
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,839
I think maybe we got off on
the wrong foot. My fault.

533
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,599
Yeah.

534
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,370
Can we start again?

535
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,639
Let's start again.

536
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,159
Jesus Christ, I'm starting to think
you can see the Eiffel Tower from

537
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,930
everywhere in this town.

538
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,279
You are a very rude man
to sit behind my desk

539
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,519
without an invitation, Mr...?

540
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,519
Why are names important right now?

541
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,199
Because I don't want
to kill a total stranger.

542
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,209
What do you want
to kill me for, Mitat?

543
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,599
You are sitting in my chair.

544
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,239
I'm just waiting for you.

545
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,239
The Albino sent you, huh? Bastard!

546
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,920
I've always been loyal. Please...

547
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,679
- These your girls in the picture?
- How dare you look at them?!

548
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,639
Sit down. I also have a
pretty teenage daughter.

549
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,839
Father to father, your girls ever

550
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,719
lock themselves in
their room, you know?

551
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,799
Cut their hair,
paint it red, you know?

552
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,207
Put wigs on and shit like that?

553
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,600
No. Never.

554
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,559
I knew it! I'm in trouble.

555
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,039
- So the Albino didn't send you to kill me?
- No.

556
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,526
Then who are you?

557
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,248
Ethan. Come on.

558
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,050
<i>♪ Soul searching</i>

559
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,959
<i>♪ Ain't no finer groove</i>

560
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,879
<i>♪ Soul searching</i>

561
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,239
<i>♪ Gonna make you move</i>

562
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,559
<i>♪ Well</i>

563
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,199
I'm gonna have a conversation
with this man in the bathroom.

564
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,839
I do not want to be disturbed.

565
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:40,159
Yes. Rule #2: Do whatever you say.

566
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,679
That's right, Rule #2.

567
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,199
- He's a bad guy?
- Something like that.

568
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,448
And you are a good guy?

569
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,639
You are a professional, huh?

570
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,079
Why have I never seen
you in Paris before?

571
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,399
I've been away on business
for about five years.

572
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,241
What is so important that you'd
leave your daughter so long?

573
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:10,041
Well, I was never good at
balancing work and family.

574
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,439
You know, when I go home,

575
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,804
this life, the killing, the
rest it all disappears.

576
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,203
I made the wrong choice leaving.

577
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,119
Everyday I bring my girls to school
and I have dinner with my family.

578
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,162
That's the key.

579
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,799
Oh, good for you, Mitat.

580
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,999
So let's not miss
dinner tonight, hmm?

581
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,604
When is the accountant
arriving in Paris?

582
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,489
Please remind me, who is he again?

583
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,679
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Driskal here.

584
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,882
I'd like to have a word
with Zooey's father.

585
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,119
I'm Zooey's father.
Is she all right?

586
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,359
Zooey's fine, but we need to meet.

587
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,319
We need to have a conversation
about Zooey's behavior.

588
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,999
I can be there right away.

589
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,326
Well, do hurry.

590
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,840
We're going to school.

591
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,719
As I was saying to Zooey,

592
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,239
study after study has shown that

593
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,839
aggression is exacerbated by
violent images in popular culture.

594
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,279
Well, Zooey's mother raised
her to be a pacifist.

595
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,599
Hm.

596
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,930
Hitting a classmate in the face
is hardly a passive response.

597
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,809
With an open hand
or a clenched fist?

598
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,919
- What difference does that make?
- Well, from my experience,

599
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,439
anger, frustration, insult,
they all call for...

600
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,404
they all call for
different responses.

601
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,719
Mr. Renner,
it's extremely important

602
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,559
that you send your
daughter a clear message

603
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,399
that no matter what she
has to confront in life

604
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,679
violence is not an
acceptable answer.

605
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,166
Ru try.

606
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,879
If that wasn't so weird, it would have
been really embarrassing, Ethan.

607
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,759
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

608
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,610
Let me see your hand, Zooey.

609
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,159
Ow, my thumb.

610
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,319
If you're gonna hit someone
with a clenched fist

611
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,719
be sure to not tuck your thumb in.

612
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,322
You've been gone for five years
and this is what you say to me?

613
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,081
Oh, God.

614
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,359
- Are you Muslim?
- No.

615
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,039
I told you this is my boss's car.

616
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,599
- Oh, so Vivi's Muslim?
- No.

617
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,079
- I'm plugging in my phone. This stuff sucks.
- I know.

618
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,799
I like this, who are these guys?

619
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,959
- Do you even care why I got into a fight?
- Let me out!

620
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,319
Why can't you just listen to
me and try to understand?

621
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,363
OK, why don't you
tell me all about it?

622
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,439
I have a new friend from Pakistan,

623
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,959
and there's this British girl
who keeps calling her Paki.

624
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,919
Today she put bacon in her locker,
so I hit her in the face.

625
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,999
Well, she won't do
that again, will she?

626
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,165
Just a second, sweetie, sounds like
the spare's loose in the trunk.

627
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,646
Hey!

628
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,841
I'm trying to have a
conversation with my daughter.

629
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,759
I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie,
now where were we?

630
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,159
- Punching the girl, right?
- I feel really bad.

631
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,399
Well, don't, because sometimes it's
the only way to stop a bad guy.

632
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,279
- So you're not mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

633
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,323
I'm proud of you, you
stuck up for your friend.

634
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,124
Whatever. I'm taking the metro.

635
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,879
- And, Ethan?
- Yeah.

636
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,209
You might want to take something
for that cough. It's really annoying.

637
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,926
Jesus Christ!

638
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,727
Let's see if we can jump
start your memory, Mitat.

639
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,119
It's my daughter.

640
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,919
- Zooey?
- Hey. Sorry about earlier.

641
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,090
That's OK, honey. I'm sorry, too.

642
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,479
Favorite place to hang
out after school?

643
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,845
I'll wrap my sales meeting and
meet you at 3:30, sweetie.

644
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,331
She just invited me to hang out.
What do you think about that?

645
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,799
A girl like this will keep
you running in circles.

646
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,083
You must draw the
line, not be so soft.

647
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,569
You're right, Mitat.

648
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,199
I have been way too soft.

649
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,439
Now, where do I find the
Albino's accountant, hmm?

650
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,319
Hi, Zooey.

651
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,519
It's 3:40, Ethan. Where are you?

652
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,759
I'm on my bike, sweetie.

653
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,639
Forget it, you're always
late. I'm leaving.

654
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,119
No, no, no, I'm almost
there, honestly, Zooey.

655
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,765
Give me...

656
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,439
Give me five minutes.

657
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,405
Fine, five minutes.
I have homework.

658
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,241
Wow.

659
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,439
Kids.

660
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,239
<i>Sorry I freaked out earlier.</i>

661
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,719
<i>It's just Hugh and the prom
and you came into town.</i>

662
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,559
<i>This is really new for
both of us. I get it.</i>

663
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,479
So, favorite place to go after
Flying Chairs, you remember?

664
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,919
- I remember.
- Kind of?

665
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,610
- Yeah.
- OK.

666
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,925
Gosh, the bike.

667
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,924
What's going on, Ethan?

668
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,199
It's just some flu I picked up.

669
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,359
Can't seem to shake it off.

670
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,720
What if it's something worse?

671
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,799
No, it's, uh...

672
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,844
It's nothing worse.

673
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,159
You remember when we'd drink hot
chocolate at the beach house?

674
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,679
Sort of.

675
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,719
It's the one place I
wouldn't mind calling home.

676
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,120
- More than Pittsburgh, really?
- Yeah, more than Pittsburgh.

677
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,123
You know, I kept all our
home movies in a box.

678
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,959
How about we make dinner
and watch them tonight?

679
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,369
- Yeah, that'd be awesome.
- Good.

680
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,119
Oh, shoot, I forgot. I have
to go to Karina's tonight.

681
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,319
- Who?
- Karina, she's my lab partner.

682
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,999
We're doing a science project together.
I'm going to spend the night.

683
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,999
- On a school night?
- Yeah. I'm sorry, Ethan, I'm really sorry.

684
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,719
No, it's OK. It's just...

685
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,759
Don't I need to call
her parents first?

686
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,839
Yeah, if you speak Russian.

687
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,439
That's all her parents understand.

688
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,159
Look, call Mom.
She'll tell you it's cool.

689
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,091
I don't need to call your mom.

690
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,762
- Can we watch those movies tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.

691
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,524
See you later.

692
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,519
<i>Hi, this is Christine, I'm not
here, so please leave a message.</i>

693
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,370
Tina, it's me.

694
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,359
Can you believe Zooey and I
hung out on flying chairs

695
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,559
and we had hot chocolate
and it was her idea?

696
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:38,369
Thanks for all this, Tina.
You're a really great mom.

697
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,799
<i>Hi, I'm thrilled
everything's going so well.</i>

698
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,559
<i>But, uh, who is this friend?</i>

699
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,159
<i>Well, I've never heard of her
nor her Russian parents.</i>

700
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,850
<i>Anyways, give me a call.</i>

701
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,284
Zooey!

702
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,884
<i>Non, non.</i>

703
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,489
Son of a bitch!

704
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,651
Is this your car?

705
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,159
<i>Pardon</i>... Is this your car?

706
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,600
- Whoa.
- No.

707
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,119
Hey! You know the rule.

708
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,599
Never involve family.

709
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,999
This isn't a business
meeting, Mitat, this is...

710
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:03,639
This is more of a
father-to-father type of visit.

711
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,444
- It's dinner time.
- Mitat?

712
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,245
- Do you know this man, Mitat?
- Yeah, we work together.

713
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,331
- Never seen him before.
- It's an American.

714
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,719
OK. Come, come with us.

715
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,919
Thanks for that.

716
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,479
This is Rachelle, Sarah.

717
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,999
I have a serious problem
with my daughter, Zooey.

718
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,959
You've been gone for five years
and you did not expect trouble?

719
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,279
- We cannot help you.
- That's right, you probably can't.

720
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,039
But your girls might be
able to tell me where

721
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,528
a 16-year-old would go to
party on a school night.

722
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,886
What does this "spider" mean?

723
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,519
They are good girls,
they do not party.

724
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,210
What does this "spider" mean?

725
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,879
La Soiree House.

726
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,199
- How do you know that?
- Thank you.

727
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,728
I have a daughter in there.

728
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,169
Zooey.

729
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,887
<i>Oui.</i>

730
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,521
Zooey!

731
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,170
Stop, please, please.

732
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,886
Stop, please.

733
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,681
Ethan!

734
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,201
Ethan!

735
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,565
Ethan! Please!

736
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,003
Come on, Zooey. Come on.

737
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,081
I got you, honey.

738
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,446
What are you doing here?

739
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,324
Better question, Zooey, is,
what were you doing last night?

740
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,288
God, this is so embarrassing. They'll
never let me in there again.

741
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,199
Why would you ever want to go
back to a place like that?

742
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,599
Because I like being
with my friends.

743
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,039
Your friends?

744
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,561
Do you even remember what happened?

745
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,725
In the bathroom?

746
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,679
- Zooey!
- What?

747
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,319
In the bathroom, do you
remember what happened?

748
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,126
Look, Karina and I aced
the practice test, OK?

749
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,759
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did.

750
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,167
So we decided to go hang
out with some friends.

751
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,679
I've gotta go catch the metro,
I'm gonna be late for school.

752
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,399
- You're not going to the metro.
- What?

753
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,365
You're not going to school today.
Not dressed like that.

754
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,799
You're putting this on
and we're going home.

755
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,799
- We're gonna have a talk.
- How exactly am I supposed to get home?

756
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,999
- Gonna ride this bike.
- I don't think so, Ethan.

757
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,559
You're getting on this bike and I'm
gonna follow you every step of the way.

758
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,879
- No, you're not.
- Stop talking and get on the bike.

759
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,399
I thought that's what you
wanted to do, Ethan, talk!

760
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,439
Get on this bike.

761
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,529
- Or what?
- Now!

762
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,207
I don't even know how
to ride a bike, OK?

763
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,365
What kind of kid doesn't
know how to ride a bike?

764
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,522
The kind of kid who never
had a father to teach her.

765
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,450
Goddamn it.

766
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,959
This is the flattest spot, so
let's just try it right here.

767
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,919
Gosh, did you have to get
the biggest bike there?

768
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,079
It's not the biggest bike,
Zooey, it's a girl's bike.

769
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,439
Right, you picked it 'cause
it had the big bow on it.

770
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,719
No. I can explain the big
bow, I got it. Get on.

771
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,879
There's too many people. Look,
can we go somewhere private?

772
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,764
- Gosh.
- There's not too many people.

773
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,686
But it's purple.

774
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,119
It is purple. Get on.

775
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,961
- How do you even get on it?
- Just get on.

776
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,039
Wow, we did it. We're
halfway there. We're on it.

777
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,919
Give yourself time to push here, OK?
It's right here then. All right?

778
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,239
Zooey, all right.

779
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,851
- Whoa. OK?
- OK.

780
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,919
- Good.
- Easy, please.

781
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,079
OK, I have you. Now, just
kinda, you know how to pedal.

782
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,442
- Yes. I'm right here.
- Why is it so high?

783
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,529
Don't let go. I'm gonna...

784
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,166
<i>Why did you leave us, Ethan?</i>

785
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,885
<i>Why did you leave me and Mom?</i>

786
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,719
<i>Look, I traveled a lot, sweetheart,
and your mother and I...</i>

787
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,649
<i>What?</i>

788
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,444
There is no easy...

789
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,484
There's no good answer, honey.

790
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,599
All right.

791
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,559
- Do you have another family?
- No. No, sweetheart. I didn't. Come on.

792
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,919
<i>Do you have another family?</i>

793
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,079
- Is that what it is?
<i>- No.</i>

794
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,079
<i>Do you have another perfect
daughter somewhere?</i>

795
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,119
Did you see me and not want me?

796
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,721
- Do you not love me?
- No, sweetheart, no, that's not it.

797
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,481
<i>Well, why did it take so
long for you to come back?</i>

798
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,839
Look!

799
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,599
<i>The longer I was gone...</i>

800
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,770
it felt like the harder
it was to come back.

801
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,162
OK, OK, all right.

802
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,567
That's all. It's nothing
to do with you.

803
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,439
<i>Would you still care about
me if I did horrible things?</i>

804
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,926
Yes, of course.

805
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,559
Absolutely.

806
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,159
I lie a lot. Like, all the
time about everything.

807
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,799
Even when I don't need to.
I don't know why.

808
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,879
Well, you know, sometimes that's
easier than telling the truth.

809
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,399
That girl I hit at school, she
wasn't teasing a Pakistani friend.

810
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,479
She was hitting on Hugh.

811
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,679
- It's all right, he prefers soccer.
- Yeah.

812
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,006
Hugh!

813
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,479
These are so beautiful, thank you!

814
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,599
Give me one sec,
I'll be right back.

815
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,007
Ethan, don't say anything weird.

816
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,599
- You rave, Hugh?
- What?

817
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,199
- You rave?
- No, no way, Mr. Zoe.

818
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,239
I'm an athlete. I'm a striker.

819
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,602
Last game I scored two
goals, by the way.

820
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,327
- So you like to score?
- Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah.

821
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,559
No! Well, I... I... I
mean on the field.

822
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,439
- Yeah.
- On the field only, yeah.

823
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,159
- Soccer?
- Yeah.

824
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,919
Not a fan. I'm from Pittsburgh,
where we play real football.

825
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,203
- Oh yeah, American football.
- No.

826
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,445
Real football.

827
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,801
OK.

828
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,999
Nice bike.

829
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,959
- You like the bike?
- Yeah.

830
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,491
You're the only one.

831
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,159
I won't be home late, Ethan.

832
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,679
- Where are you two going?
- School.

833
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,879
Great, well, I'm headed
that direction myself.

834
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,359
No, you're not.

835
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,599
Yeah, well, I could be.
I'm going to the market.

836
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,839
Oh, OK, well, I'm gonna...

837
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,520
OK, see you later, Mr. Zooey.

838
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,839
I don't like being called that.

839
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,319
You don't like Hugh?

840
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,239
I'm in, uh, sales, sweetie.

841
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:40,959
It's my business to read people.

842
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,399
You know, a lot of my friends'
dads are in sales, Ethan,

843
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,119
and not one of them
dresses like you.

844
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,319
What are you saying?

845
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,603
I'm saying they wear suits.
That's what they wear to work.

846
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,843
Hey, I love you!

847
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,045
- Haven't I helped you enough?
- You know the drill.

848
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,279
The accountant checked out. I need
you to tell me where he is now.

849
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,479
- I gave him to you yesterday.
- I know you did.

850
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,919
And now you're back.
I thought you were a pro.

851
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,559
I'm suddenly a single dad.
It's getting complicated.

852
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,759
Is it my fault if your
daughter is out of control

853
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,519
and affecting your
work and judgment?

854
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,919
You're right, Mitat. It
is affecting my judgment.

855
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,319
'Cause you should have
been dead a long time ago.

856
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,599
Hey, my wife works late. I need
to pick up my girls at 4:30.

857
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,087
I can't promise, but
I'll make an effort.

858
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,161
Open up.

859
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,769
I can't get around your mirror.

860
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,929
Fine, asshole.

861
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,841
Yes!

862
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,402
Ethan! Ethan!

863
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,559
That briefcase has the routing codes
to the Albino's accounts, doesn't it?

864
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,841
Yeah.

865
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,319
Do not open! The lock has
an explosive trigger.

866
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:17,399
I got the codes to the briefcase. Give
me the codes to the trigger, Guido.

867
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,399
But after I give it to
you, you will kill me.

868
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,839
No, but I swear to God I'm
gonna really torture you

869
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,839
- if you make me count to three.
- No.

870
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,639
- OK, one...
- Oh, no.

871
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,919
- ...two
- No.

872
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,691
No.

873
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,879
- Zooey?
- Ethan, so listen,

874
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,119
I was thinking about tonight.

875
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:41,041
Sweetie, I'm gonna be home on time for
dinner, all right? I promise. Now, can I...

876
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,319
- Can I call you back?
- I want to make dinner for Hugh tonight.

877
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,568
Just the two of you, like a...

878
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,399
- ...romantic dinner?
<i>- Something like that.</i>

879
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,199
And I want to make him
real spaghetti sauce

880
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,039
<i>but I don't know what I
need besides tomatoes.</i>

881
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,720
I can't find Mom,
so I need your help.

882
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,691
Just a sec, sweetie.

883
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,090
Guido, are you a real Italian?

884
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,359
What?

885
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,879
I mean, are you a real Italian?
I mean, were you born there?

886
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,039
Yes. Catania, Sicily.

887
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,242
Could she have a recipe for sauce?

888
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,399
Sauce?

889
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,519
Yeah, sauce, you know, sauce.

890
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,559
- Is that code?
- No, it's not code.

891
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,599
- You just said you're a real Italian, right?
<i>- Si.</i>

892
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,119
Si, so you must know a little
something about spaghetti sauce!

893
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,961
Ah! Spaghetti sauce! Red or white?

894
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,079
- Red or white?
- Red, vegetable, not too spicy.

895
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,159
Vegetarian, not too spicy.

896
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,479
OK, I know what to tell her.

897
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,839
Sweetie, it just so happens I'm in a
meeting here with a real live Italian.

898
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,119
His mama has a great recipe.

899
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,119
He wants to give it to you.
His name is Guido.

900
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,324
Why don't you say
hello to my daughter.

901
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,279
Hello. I am Guido.

902
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,919
Hi, Guido, this will
only take a second.

903
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,119
No, no!

904
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,159
- Please take all the time you want.
- Who's Guido?

905
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,639
No, no, no.

906
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:18,359
So, this is my mama's
favorite reduction sauce.

907
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:23,679
You will need tomatoes,
capers and garlic.

908
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,919
She always uses tomatoes
from her garden.

909
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,199
Your mom has a garden?
That is so cool.

910
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,399
Yes, she worked all her life
so I could go to school,

911
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,959
and now I am the only one
left to take care of her.

912
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,926
What else, Guido?

913
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,519
Heat the olive oil,
crush the garlic.

914
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,199
Then you peel the tomatoes.

915
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,639
After ten minutes, no more,

916
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,959
add capers and parsley.

917
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,159
And my mama's secret
is a cup of red wine

918
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,442
and a teaspoon of sugar.

919
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,199
Boy, that Guido's a
real mama's boy, huh?

920
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,439
I think it's sweet that he loves
his mother. Thanks, Ethan.

921
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,531
- Remember, don't get home too early.
- OK.

922
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,919
No, wait!

923
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,439
Oh, please call her back.

924
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,929
I wanted to give her my mama's
favorite recipe for cannoli.

925
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,005
You know how to tell time?

926
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,681
Where's the one?

927
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,961
Where's the three?

928
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,199
That's two hours.

929
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,719
You cut this guy
loose in two hours.

930
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:45,199
Guido, remind me where you're
going after this kid lets you go.

931
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,404
I'm going back home
to live with Mama!

932
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,289
You're late.

933
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,569
I'm in the middle of
a training session.

934
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:37,001
Yeah, I... I can see that.

935
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,885
Job's done.

936
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,559
- You're no fun.
- Not really.

937
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,171
Sit down.

938
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,130
Or did you forget why you came?

939
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,490
- Champagne?
- I don't think so.

940
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,279
You're just an American girl having
a good time in Paris, aren't you?

941
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,479
Who doesn't love Paris?

942
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,439
Now that we've
bankrupted the Albino,

943
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,559
he'll come running back to Paris
with his tail between his legs,

944
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,599
leading us straight to the Wolf.

945
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,370
When?

946
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,205
Very soon.

947
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,165
You can't go dressed like that.

948
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,799
What's wrong with how I dress?

949
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,731
What are you, <i>cheri</i>, 42 long?

950
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,279
Yes.

951
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,642
- Take it off.
- Excuse me?

952
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,449
Shoes, everything. Let's go.

953
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,719
- What's going on?
- Baby.

954
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,126
Baby?

955
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,562
You let that guy go, right?
You didn't hurt him?

956
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:10,359
No, you keep that,
that's yours now.

957
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,639
My God.

958
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,649
This is not the first
time for you, after all.

959
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,319
Actually, it is.

960
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,965
What about your daughter?

961
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,039
I wasn't there.

962
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:03,531
I was working far away,
in Africa to be precise.

963
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,090
You were doing good?

964
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,211
I don't even remember.

965
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,479
The baby is coming!

966
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,011
It is a girl.

967
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,719
Before the baby leaves the
house for the first time,

968
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:46,403
it is our custom to have the
family offer a blessing.

969
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,839
- Leave?
- Yes.

970
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,559
- We are keeping our word to you.
- Word?

971
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,279
What word? I mean, I just
I brought Chinese, OK?

972
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,479
I've got a 100 fortune cookies.

973
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:04,127
It's OK. Everything
is as it should be.

974
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,879
Look, I didn't mean for you to have to
leave right after the child was born.

975
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,731
I mean, there's plenty
of room for everyone.

976
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,759
Maybe it's too much room.

977
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:20,799
My wife wants a smaller place
out of the city. No guests.

978
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,879
Just us and the children.

979
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,759
It is good as long
as we are together.

980
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:30,009
Sumia wants to call the baby Ethan.

981
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,679
- It's a boy's name.
- No.

982
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,879
It's the name of a great man who
didn't shoot us when he could.

983
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,999
And instead gave us his home.

984
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,089
She has chosen carefully.

985
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,370
The name is perfect.

986
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,759
Hey, how did it go?

987
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,439
Hugh asked me to go to the prom.

988
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,719
Good.

989
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,888
So dinner was a success.

990
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,607
Wow. You look nice.

991
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,160
Did you wear that for me today?

992
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,559
Uh... no. I had to...

993
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,119
I had to give a speech.

994
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,279
Are you coming to the
pre-party tomorrow?

995
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,159
Well, I am if you're asking.

996
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:17,359
It's on Hugh's father's rooftop.

997
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,279
You know Hugh comes from
a really cultured family.

998
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,322
Yeah.

999
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:27,481
Don't forget you've got Steelers
blood running through your veins.

1000
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,844
They sent Hugh to a special school to learn
how to dance when he was like eight.

1001
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,079
So?

1002
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,759
So that means he's probably
a really good dancer.

1003
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,519
So?

1004
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,202
So I don't know how to
dance like that, Ethan.

1005
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,279
- No.
- Come on.

1006
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,847
- I'm not gonna dance.
- You can stand on my feet.

1007
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,279
- I'm too big for this.
- You're not too big.

1008
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,767
Now, stand on my feet.

1009
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,759
I'm gonna teach you how to dance
to your mother's favorite song.

1010
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,559
OK.

1011
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:20,525
There and back.

1012
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,999
- Pretty easy, huh?
- Not too bad.

1013
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,966
Now get off.

1014
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,647
Would you wear this
suit tomorrow for me?

1015
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,362
Of course I would.

1016
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,811
Mom.

1017
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,089
Sweetie.

1018
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,719
<i>You haven't coughed.
Not since I've been back.</i>

1019
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,839
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

1020
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:30,159
<i>Remember when I'd bring Zooey
to school in the first grade?</i>

1021
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,159
She had that stuffed rabbit.

1022
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,646
Lamby the lamb.

1023
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,447
Right, Lamby the lamb.

1024
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,399
<i>I remember the day she never
took him to school again.</i>

1025
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:46,799
<i>My stomach hurt that day.
That's how I feel now.</i>

1026
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,799
<i>- Like you lost something.
- Yeah.</i>

1027
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,482
- Have you told her yet?
- No.

1028
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:59,321
- You're gonna have to.
- I know.

1029
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,199
Just tell her you love her.

1030
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,439
She knows.

1031
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:08,079
She needs to hear it from you.

1032
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:12,365
Of course I love her. I mean,
I love her the same way...

1033
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,050
the same way I love you.

1034
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,279
Good morning.

1035
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,720
Oh, God.

1036
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,239
- You're not on the couch.
- No, Tina, I'm not on the couch.

1037
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,044
Good morning, parents.

1038
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,839
Wow, sweetheart.
What a good idea. Here.

1039
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,319
Bring that orange juice right here.

1040
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,239
Sweetie, just put down the tray,
I'll meet you in the kitchen. OK?

1041
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,559
Come on, I squeezed the
oranges all by myself.

1042
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,807
Now, please.

1043
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,639
What's wrong, Mom?
You're acting really weird.

1044
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:39,479
Nothing, sweetie. Just go finish getting
dressed and I'll take you to school.

1045
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,119
Come on, let's go. Go.

1046
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,719
Love you, Mom.

1047
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,410
I love you, sweetie.

1048
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,679
What's wrong with her seeing us?

1049
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,928
Really.

1050
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,691
What happens when you're gone?

1051
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,519
Yeah?

1052
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,882
<i>The Albino is staying
at the Grand Hotel.</i>

1053
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,481
All right.

1054
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:23,244
Hey. I'm not going anywhere.

1055
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,479
- Hello.
<i>- You spotted me.</i>

1056
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,639
- I'd have to be blind not to.
<i>- Don't do anything stupid, Mitat.</i>

1057
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,679
Your girls are expecting
you home tonight.

1058
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:14,042
<i>So is your beautiful wife.</i>

1059
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,924
Who were you talking to?

1060
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,127
Come on, accelerate!

1061
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,521
Come on!

1062
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,840
Come on, faster!

1063
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:15,000
Have we lost him?

1064
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,328
This kind of guy,
he'd never give up.

1065
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:02,964
Why you don't kill me already?

1066
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:08,209
Because you're the
father who knows best.

1067
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,046
Just kill him!

1068
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,401
Vivi...

1069
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,405
Welcome back.

1070
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:44,522
You let the Wolf slip
through your hands again.

1071
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:47,047
Where am I?

1072
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,365
A safe place.

1073
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,679
We got your lab results
back today, Ethan.

1074
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:58,519
I was actually pretty curious
myself. And as it turns out,

1075
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:01,769
it looks like the treatment's
having a positive effect on you.

1076
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:12,279
It's my wife. Hello?

1077
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:14,359
<i>Hi. Where are you?</i>

1078
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:15,721
Um...

1079
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,399
I'm leaving the
doctor's office now.

1080
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:22,039
<i>Hurry up and get home. We're
gonna be late for Zooey's party.</i>

1081
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:23,730
OK.

1082
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:30,599
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life killing for you, Vivi.

1083
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,609
You're almost there, Ethan.

1084
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:35,881
Kill the Wolf.

1085
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,639
I'm gonna need a new suit.

1086
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,084
You heard him.

1087
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,919
There has been a change in plans.
We're leaving tonight.

1088
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,599
Take me to my partner's house.

1089
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,962
He will help me to
get out of Paris.

1090
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,759
- Mom, don't ruin my night.
- Why don't you try them on?

1091
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,849
No!

1092
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,679
- Listen, just at least try them on?
- No!

1093
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:22,361
Whoa!

1094
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:29,599
Just smile and have fun.

1095
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:33,239
Why? I hate these shoes.
I look like Little Miss Sunshine.

1096
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,563
- You look great, honey.
- No, I don't.

1097
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:54,079
- Zoe.
- Hugh.

1098
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,279
- You look great.
- Really, I do?

1099
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,527
Yeah, of course.

1100
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,806
Oh, Mr. Renner, Mrs. Renner,

1101
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,359
these are my parents.

1102
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:06,519
Nice to see you again.
Thanks for inviting us.

1103
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,199
You're welcome.

1104
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,239
This is Ethan, Zooey's dad.

1105
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:12,442
Hi. And this is my partner.

1106
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,410
Pleasure to meet you.

1107
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,486
And you.

1108
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,851
If it wasn't for this party,
we might never have met.

1109
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,481
How do you do?

1110
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:34,484
Enchanté.

1111
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:38,639
Wow.

1112
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,039
Yeah, wow.

1113
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,641
Kids.

1114
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,445
Wow.

1115
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,684
- May I take this? Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

1116
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,319
Isn't this great?

1117
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,760
Yeah.

1118
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,170
Zooey, do me a favor.

1119
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:26,527
Try and use your best
judgment with Hugh tonight.

1120
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:37,801
Cheers.

1121
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,685
You're working again!

1122
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:58,564
Yeah. There's a problem here.

1123
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:03,399
That's why you came back to Paris?

1124
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:06,879
No. I came back to
see you and Zooey.

1125
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,639
It was all a lie.

1126
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:11,119
You promised you'd keep
your work away from us.

1127
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:14,319
- You're probably not even sick.
- It's not a lie, Tina.

1128
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,727
Right now I don't have
the time to explain.

1129
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:39,206
How many guys do we have?

1130
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,759
The police will be
here in ten minutes.

1131
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,999
- You all right?
- No.

1132
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,170
No, I'm not so good.
I've gotta go...

1133
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:55,011
If we go now, there is enough time.

1134
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,204
OK. This party's over.

1135
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,639
- You used us both!
- No, I would never do that.

1136
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,719
I'll get my funds,
bring everyone in.

1137
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,888
Make sure the street's blocked.

1138
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,488
At least have the
decency to look at me.

1139
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,921
Kill him.

1140
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:29,799
It's just bad luck.

1141
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:32,521
You're sick, Ethan.

1142
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,679
Wow, this is unbelievable.

1143
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,928
Yeah. I know. It's crazy.

1144
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,405
I'm gonna be sick.

1145
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:59,970
Come with me.

1146
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:19,090
Did you scratch yourself?

1147
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:24,799
No, please don't go.
Come home with me.

1148
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,200
Just leave it to someone else.

1149
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,122
Just please stay here.

1150
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,639
- Zooey!
- What?

1151
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:45,966
Get down!

1152
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,250
You hear me in there?

1153
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,085
I'm sending you down.

1154
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,605
Oh, shit.

1155
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:44,441
Wheel's turning.

1156
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:50,759
No, stay, you fuckers!

1157
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,883
Don't!

1158
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,889
I gotta...

1159
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,484
Don't.

1160
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:14,084
I wouldn't mind killing you.

1161
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,002
You scared a lot of
people up there.

1162
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,848
This is my daughter's party.

1163
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:36,611
Yes.

1164
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:41,687
Yes, come on.

1165
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,406
Viv.

1166
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,009
Oh, my God.

1167
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,479
Am I in hell?

1168
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,639
So that's what it looks
like to you, Ethan.

1169
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:13,003
Figures.

1170
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:17,605
- Finish it.
- What?

1171
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,559
You'll do what I tell you to.

1172
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,969
- No.
- Finish it.

1173
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:29,690
I passed my quota, Vivi.

1174
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:31,839
Ethan...

1175
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,089
Jesus Christ!

1176
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,486
<i>Are you really done
working for them?</i>

1177
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:48,679
<i>A killer is a killer.
He'll never change.</i>

1178
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:50,639
<i>I know I haven't done
right by you and Zooey.</i>

1179
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,559
Kill him.

1180
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,119
<i>I should've left a long time ago.</i>

1181
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:56,399
<i>- What about your daughter?
- I wasn't there.</i>

1182
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,126
Do it.

1183
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,879
<i>What kind of kid doesn't
know how to ride a bike?</i>

1184
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:06,651
<i>The kind of kid who never
had a father to teach her.</i>

1185
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:09,961
<i>- Ethan.
- Ethan!</i>

1186
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:12,599
Do it!

1187
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,520
<i>Promise you'll never
lie to me again.</i>

1188
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,641
You have no choice.

1189
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,643
I don't think so.

1190
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:28,047
The wife wants me to give it up.

1191
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,759
<i>Can I talk to her?</i>

1192
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:11,719
<i>No, she's down on the beach
right now throwing rocks.</i>

1193
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,279
<i>- What?
- Yeah, we're...</i>

1194
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,119
<i>We're taking a break from
each other right now.</i>

1195
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,319
<i>At least she's not
throwing them at me.</i>

1196
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,559
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

1197
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,839
Yeah, it's been all right.
There's been good and bad days.

1198
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:27,079
She said things, I've said things.

1199
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:29,639
<i>There's been some tears,</i>

1200
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,922
<i>but the week overall's
been really worth it.</i>

1201
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,441
Hey.

1202
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:10,079
These are some presents
from me and, um...

1203
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,399
a package that was
dropped at the house.

1204
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:15,490
I can hear your car running.
Are you gonna go back?

1205
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:23,204
I love you, Tina.

1206
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,529
Just not enough to quit.

1207
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:31,962
I think you're wrong,
but I understand.

1208
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:40,159
If I could say one word to
you to change your mind,

1209
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,359
would you give me that chance?

1210
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,005
This isn't a game.

1211
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:47,959
We don't have to stay in the same room,
we don't have to sleep together,

1212
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,119
that's not what I'm asking.

1213
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:53,799
If that becomes important,
you'll be the one to decide.

1214
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,639
I'll hear the music,
and then I'll know.

1215
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:57,490
And if I never hear it...

1216
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:01,122
I've already gotten
more than I deserve.

1217
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:08,926
I just wanna hang out as long as I
can with my daughter and my wife.

1218
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:13,799
- What's the word?
- What?

1219
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,479
What's the one word to
make me change my mind?

1220
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:19,765
It's, uh... it's Christmas.

1221
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,319
That's two, Ethan.

1222
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,759
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi, sweetie.

1223
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,200
I'm so glad you came!

1224
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:33,205
Come on, let's go inside.

1225
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,049
Dad's gonna make us hot cocoa.

1226
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,041
Come on.

1227
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,651
Is Dad a badass?

1228
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:10,486
Well, he's, um... He's
done some things.

1229
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:19,399
You think Dad's gonna stick around?

1230
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,125
As long as he can, sweetheart.

1231
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,250
He loves you so much.

1232
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:56,241
Luis-subs Subtitling :D.
