1
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:50,426
The Year of our Lord
*1348*

2
00:00:53,447 --> 00:00:57,820
The fumes of the dead hung in the air like poison.

3
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:05,231
A plague more cruel and more pitiless than war had descended upon us.

4
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:10,834
A pestilence that would leave half our kingdom dead.

5
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:17,089
Where did it come from?

6
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:20,086
What carried it's germ?

7
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:23,504
The priests told us it
was God's punishment.

8
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:25,873
For what sin?

9
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,402
What commandment must we break that would earn this?

10
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:35,376
No, we knew the truth.

11
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:40,297
This was not God's work, but devilry.

12
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,714
Or witchcraft.

13
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:48,378
And our task, to hunt down a demon,
is God's cure.

14
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:36,923
Brother Thomas.

15
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,272
Brother Thomas.

16
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:06,294
Who was taken from us?
- Brother Ignatius.

17
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:09,357
Is it the pestilence?
- We have not been told.

18
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:13,436
I have no signs. Please brother.

19
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,715
Let me out.

20
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:44,510
Averill.

21
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:50,419
O thanks pretty gorgeous.

22
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:54,712
Where've you been?
- I was confined .... sacred.

23
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:03,211
I thought you were dead.

24
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:06,959
I'm alright.
- I prayed, prayed all the time.

25
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:09,029
I'm alright.

26
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:12,440
I 've brought food.

27
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:21,541
One of our brothers
died this morning, Averill.

28
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,759
Even the monastery is no longer safe, you must go now.

29
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,833
You must go back to Dentwich Forest
and you must hide there till this is passed.

30
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:35,425
On Sunday the prior said the pestilence was God's new purge, send to wash away our sins.

31
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:39,751
Is God punishing us?
- No.

32
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:40,928
No.

33
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:47,653
You must go now.

34
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:50,542
You must go back to Dentwich.

35
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:57,613
You must go.

36
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:17,553
Osmund, I ...
- Averill, you'll die.

37
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:19,966
And you will not?

38
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,837
Come with me.

39
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:30,715
If I leave the monastery now, I betray God.

40
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:33,215
We've already betrayed him.

41
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:19,046
You know the Martyrs Cross
at Dentwich forest?

42
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,862
I will wait for you there,
every morning at dawn for one week.

43
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:29,154
And then I will be gone.

44
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,403
Forgive me, Father. I am confused.

45
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,126
I confess, I am torn.

46
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,755
Can I serve you outside of these walls?

47
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,881
I would leave here, but I would never stray from your grace, father.

48
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:25,114
Show me Your will.

49
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:29,316
Father, give me a sign.

50
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:08,754
I am Ulric, envoy to the bishop.

51
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:12,614
What I say know does not leave these walls.

52
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:18,469
Word has reached the bishop of a village that does not suffer as the rest.

53
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:22,844
They say it is a sanctuary from the pestilence.

54
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:27,964
There are many villages that have not been ravaged yet by the pestilence.

55
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:32,090
It is claimed these villagers are beyond it's icy grasp.

56
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:34,757
Then they are greatly mistaken.

57
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,468
These are difficult times.

58
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,962
Such claims however fantastical...

59
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,588
can find favor with those
less educated than you or I.

60
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:54,462
Precisely why we cannot fall foul
of rumor and superstition.

61
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,298
God's grip on his people is lucent.

62
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:02,646
We must ensure the flock is not tempted to look beyond God and church for answers.

63
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:08,093
I must see for myself how this village is kept safe.

64
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:13,009
What part have we in this?
- The village I seek lies in the great marsh.

65
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:16,918
I require a guide, a man of God,
to show the way.

66
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:20,219
No man here fit for such a task.

67
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:25,591
With the bishop's blessing
I may choose any man here.

68
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:29,300
Out of respect..
I grant you that choice

69
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:31,752
I will lead you there.

70
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:36,794
No, he is a mere novice.
This requires a more experienced hand.

71
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:38,422
Let him speak.

72
00:11:38,638 --> 00:11:43,840
The said village you seek lies in the great marsh. I was raised close by in Dentwich Forest.

73
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:46,922
I know the area better than any man.

74
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:51,215
He has all the experience I require.

75
00:11:52,138 --> 00:11:55,301
You will lead us.
We leave at dawn.

76
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,670
Osmund, that man is more dangerous
than the pestilence itself.

77
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,376
Father, I prayed for guidance.

78
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:06,137
God has answered.

79
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:29,502
Even if you survive,
the world out there will change you.

80
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:32,292
Perhaps that's what I want Father.

81
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,925
My lady love and I, we lived in joyeous sin,

82
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,220
now my lady love has got the blackened skin.

83
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:05,301
My lady love and I, we pour our love so brave,

84
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:08,796
now my lady love rots in an early grave.

85
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,713
We have our guide.

86
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:38,087
God has no men left,

87
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:41,175
he sends us a boy.

88
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:43,346
Are you up to it, son?

89
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:45,463
I can lead you there.

90
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,422
Pray you do.

91
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,133
Split any man from his asshole to his apple.

92
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,422
What's that for?

93
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,262
How much does he know?

94
00:14:57,472 --> 00:15:02,710
Ulric was ahh 'frugal' shall we say
with the truth.

95
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,543
This village we're headed to...

96
00:15:07,764 --> 00:15:12,421
they've cast God aside.
In his place sits a demon.

97
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,339
There was talk of sacrifice.
Of men eating men and of raising the dead.

98
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:23,509
Now we're charged to bring the leader of this village back for confession, trial and execution.

99
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:27,798
The bishop seeks to roast themself a necromancer.
- Sorry, what is a necromancer?

100
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:32,422
A necromancer is someone who plucks the dead
from the cold earth,

101
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,044
breathes new life into them.

102
00:15:36,347 --> 00:15:38,836
We have the tools, we have the will.

103
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:41,212
We journey into hell.

104
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:45,843
But God travels with us.
- So you misled me.

105
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:51,673
Return to your monastery if you feel betrayed, or join us and do God's work.

106
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:55,006
Let's get this cleared up, let's get going.

107
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:58,763
That includes you, Swire.

108
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:45,046
We are not as bad as you think.

109
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:49,753
But worse.
But we need you alive.

110
00:16:50,473 --> 00:16:53,673
You seem well suited to keeping men alive.

111
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:58,340
I've spent many a long years in the king's army
with Wolfstan and Griff.

112
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:04,055
I'll be honest with ya'. We've faced a demon before, but we take what comes our way.

113
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:07,760
What happened to him?
- Ivo was captured.

114
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:12,511
Wouldn't talk, so the bastard French tore out his tongue.

115
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,092
And him?
- Mold is a men to leave alone...

116
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:20,096
unless there's butchery to be done.

117
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:24,347
And Dalywag, he is a torturer,
a hangman,

118
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:29,463
and if the rumor is true, murderer, thief and deceiver of women.

119
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,134
But apart from that he's a good man.

120
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:36,096
What about Ulric?
- I've got a wife and child.

121
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:42,054
I'm here for the money. Ulric is here, because God told him to come.

122
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,298
Burn!
- What's it...

123
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:58,217
Have mercy, please have mercy. No!

124
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:06,553
I've done nothing.

125
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:10,673
We must help her.
- Do you here me?! You deserve to burn!

126
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,504
I've down nothing.
- Burn! Burn the witch! Burn!

127
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,009
You're in league with the devil.
- What is her crime?

128
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:25,299
She brought death to our village.
- Death is all around us, and it's no invitation.

129
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:29,425
This does not involve you monk. Step aside.
- I have done nothing, please.

130
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,465
Please, stand aside.

131
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,513
What is this woman accused of?
- She poisoned our well in a pact with the devil now...

132
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:43,546
half the village is dead.
- I offered a simple blessing over our water to keep everyone safe.

133
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:45,720
Liar.
- I did nothing wrong.

134
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:48,660
The dying began after she was seen at the well.
- You have her confession?

135
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:51,492
Plenty of us saw her cast her spell. Now she must burn,

136
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:54,492
to spare what remains of our village.

137
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,257
Move aside.

138
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:05,632
I will not ask you again.

139
00:19:05,848 --> 00:19:07,638
Back.

140
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,840
Thank you.

141
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,463
Do not stop again.

142
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,879
Come on, brown slug.

143
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:08,718
As sure as the sun will rise and fall, witches will burn.

144
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:14,004
There's a village in the north, that burned 128 witches in one night.

145
00:20:14,224 --> 00:20:17,589
That's sixteen an hour, for eight hours.

146
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:22,346
By the time that night was through, they'd killed every woman in the village.

147
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:25,721
By the end of that week the men were shagging pigs.

148
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:31,134
Pestilence isn't trial enough, now God has us shagging pigs.

149
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,679
This village we seek, you been there?

150
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:39,386
No, but I know where it lies.

151
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,301
Hell awaits us, or so we're told.

152
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:47,884
If you've not got the stomach for it, then leave it now. And I'll have your share of the bounty.

153
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:51,756
What is the Church believe this pestilence is come from?

154
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:55,386
I don't believe God is punishing us like many do.

155
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,387
I say from France, where all foul things emerge.

156
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:04,510
For once Swire, you might not be too far from the truth.
.

157
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:09,386
Three summers passed, we fought a battle at Crecy in Normandy,

158
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:16,046
King Edward's army was dwarfed. For every twenty of us, there were a hundred Frenchmen, at least.

159
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,055
The French ...

160
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:20,671
Ah, the French.

161
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:24,470
They could sense victory, you could smell it.

162
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:29,923
On that day for the first time our archers used the longbow.

163
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,890
Quicker to load, further in flight.

164
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:37,342
Their arrows, their arrows were useless. Couldn't reach us.

165
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:42,215
And ours, ours were like a dark, buzzing cloud.

166
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:47,972
And that day's end, field was littered with their dead and their dying.

167
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:53,465
And custom how matter how fierce the battle, was to use the misericorde.

168
00:21:53,683 --> 00:21:56,467
Misericorde, it's the 'mercy-giver'.

169
00:21:57,308 --> 00:22:01,348
You stab straight through the armpit directly into the heart. It's quick and painless.

170
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:05,421
But on this day, there was an end to chivalry.

171
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:11,389
King Edward ordered every Frenchman
left alive to be killed without mercy.

172
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:16,592
Arms, heads, legs ...

173
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:18,882
hacked away.

174
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:24,255
God's greatest army
descended into savagery.

175
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:31,094
Forgive me, but how does that conscern the pestilence?

176
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,341
We invited Death among us that day.

177
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,639
He hasn't left us since.

178
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:11,307
That woman you killed,

179
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,969
she was not a witch.

180
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:19,924
Why did you volanteer to join us, monk?

181
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:23,428
To serve God.

182
00:23:23,641 --> 00:23:26,509
Killing witches serves God.

183
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:30,426
The woman was already dead.

184
00:23:31,183 --> 00:23:35,805
If I had freed her, the mob would have caught her again and burned her.

185
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:40,094
I spared her suffering.

186
00:23:42,975 --> 00:23:46,008
Sometimes that is all you can do.

187
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,849
'Turn back'.

188
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,922
Where we're headed
men have become savages.

189
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:56,308
It must've been something pretty special, to tempt you away from that nice, warm monastery.

190
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:05,260
Anything you wanna tell me?
- No.

191
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:14,180
You know what my job is?

192
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:20,600
I am a torturer, truth-getter.
Spend hours on a man.

193
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:24,912
Can smell a lie, and I smell you.

194
00:26:25,226 --> 00:26:27,797
Pray somewhere else, if i were you.

195
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:15,257
Have you broken any vows yet, boy?

196
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:18,308
Leave him be, Mold.

197
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,550
Back, get back!
Griff!

198
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:28,342
Griff?

199
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:34,679
I said: Get Back!
- Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

200
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:36,848
Let me look.

201
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:41,616
Let me look.

202
00:27:42,726 --> 00:27:45,096
Just going to take a look.

203
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:52,515
Alright? OK my friend. Just having a look.

204
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:28,139
Why didn't you tell us?

205
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:31,550
I'm sorry.

206
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:35,052
His journey is finished here.

207
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:44,264
I prefer mercy.

208
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:50,094
I need to make a confession to the friar.
- No..

209
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:55,547
Cannot be sure how this thing spread.
- WHO THE HELL ASKED YOU?

210
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:01,100
I will take your confession.

211
00:29:02,185 --> 00:29:04,969
Come, you shall have absolution.

212
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:14,057
YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!

213
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:29,346
Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti.

214
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,133
Forgive me.

215
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:38,216
Our Father who art in Heaven..

216
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,764
Hallowed be thy name..

217
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:46,132
Come thy kingdom, forfilled be thine when in heaven as in earth

218
00:29:46,248 --> 00:29:49,411
....bread give us today

219
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,847
I need a moment with him.

220
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,968
Alright.

221
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:18,577
I 'm glad it's you. I can see things..Urgh ..

222
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:32,681
Farewell my friend.

223
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:49,259
Bury him.

224
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:26,680
The forest of Dentwich.
- How far to the marsh?

225
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:28,931
Half a day, perhaps less.

226
00:31:29,144 --> 00:31:34,015
Be on your guard. God has slipped over the horizon.

227
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:48,009
You're on watch tonight, Swire.

228
00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:02,763
Giving Griff absolution...

229
00:32:03,644 --> 00:32:06,263
took courage.

230
00:32:13,852 --> 00:32:17,549
Do you truly believe this village can rise the dead?

231
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,611
I would not be here otherwise.

232
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,281
You doubt it?

233
00:32:24,394 --> 00:32:30,557
I believe that hunting necromancers and demons serves men more than it serves god.

234
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:35,384
You have learned much nestled inside the monastery.

235
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:42,009
Demons and necromancers are among us.

236
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:45,748
As you will find out.

237
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,331
Soon enough.

238
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:53,968
I'll get some sleep.

239
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:57,635
Averill.

240
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,176
Averill.

241
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:11,433
Averill.

242
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:26,849
Averill?

243
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:40,839
No.

244
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:54,974
No, no, no. No.

245
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:01,600
Averill.

246
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,561
Wake up!

247
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,603
Ulric!

248
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:23,644
Get up!

249
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:25,517
Wolfstan!

250
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,685
Ulric, wake up!
Wake up! Ulric!

251
00:35:28,895 --> 00:35:32,012
How many are in the forrest? How many?
- Calm down. What did you see? What did you see?

252
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:34,012
They are in the forrest. I don't...
- How many? How many?

253
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:35,055
I don't know. I don't know.

254
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:37,046
How many?
- He doesn't know.

255
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,267
Mold, forward, now.

256
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:11,562
Wait. Wait.

257
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:56,893
Get in there. NOW!

258
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:26,992
Yah, shut the fuck...

259
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:45,044
No!

260
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:54,659
GOD! GOD!

261
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:16,470
Where is Ivo?

262
00:39:23,355 --> 00:39:25,227
You alright?

263
00:39:38,688 --> 00:39:40,145
We lost Ivo.

264
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:46,267
Why did you leave the camp?

265
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,229
Speak.

266
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:52,687
I came her to meet a woman.
- And where is she?

267
00:39:52,896 --> 00:39:55,350
She did not survive the forrest.

268
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,352
God has punished me for leaving his monastery.

269
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,929
God has better things to think of.

270
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:07,058
Because of you...

271
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:09,725
one of my men is dead.

272
00:40:16,188 --> 00:40:18,641
If we move, we move now.

273
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:21,011
How do we know the man we've come for is not here?

274
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,765
These men are nothing more than common thieves.

275
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:29,271
You will lead us to the great marsh.
- Sir, i am of no use to you.

276
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,850
You will lead us ...

277
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:37,354
or stay here alone and be damned.

278
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,766
The village lies beyond the marsh.

279
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,054
What's the plan?

280
00:41:18,147 --> 00:41:20,635
Identify the heretic ...

281
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:22,534
capture him ...

282
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,001
put him in the cage.

283
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:27,719
That will never go across the marsh.
- Then we'll leave it behind!

284
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:31,096
Drag him here.

285
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:53,098
Come on, boy.

286
00:42:53,314 --> 00:42:55,186
Come on.

287
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:14,388
What brings you to our village?

288
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,226
We seek refuge.

289
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,144
A place to rest, nothing more.

290
00:45:24,648 --> 00:45:26,686
Then you are welcome.

291
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:34,973
My name is Hob.

292
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,182
I am Ulric.

293
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,355
You were attacked?

294
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:47,892
In the forest.

295
00:45:48,107 --> 00:45:52,266
Then you did well to reach us. That forest can be dangerous.

296
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:56,310
May I ask what you were doing?
- Bringing relief to the suffering.

297
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:58,479
Relief?

298
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,597
From what?

299
00:46:00,815 --> 00:46:03,386
Word of the pestilence has not reached you?

300
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:06,356
Word is all that has reached us.

301
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,722
Come.

302
00:46:18,898 --> 00:46:20,972
What the hell is going on?

303
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:24,188
We need guile to draw out the necromancer.

304
00:46:29,565 --> 00:46:33,772
Noone acts
unless I say so.

305
00:46:50,086 --> 00:46:52,077
Tonight we'll feed you and give you a bed.

306
00:46:52,399 --> 00:46:55,480
And in the morning we'll escort you to a safe part of the forrest.

307
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,645
We're not welcome?

308
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,558
Of course.

309
00:47:00,274 --> 00:47:02,478
But why would you stay?

310
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,888
Here is some buckets,
you need to wash.

311
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,772
This is no time to be blinded by grief.

312
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:43,158
If this is hell
can't wait for heaven.

313
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:46,729
You're not bound for heaven, Swire.
Believe me.

314
00:48:15,024 --> 00:48:16,814
I'll tend to your wounds.

315
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,455
I'll tend to your wound.

316
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:24,868
That needs to be dressed.

317
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:28,812
Come with me.
- Maybe you should get her seeing to.

318
00:48:57,441 --> 00:49:00,723
Where are you from?
- From the monastery at Staveley.

319
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:05,016
You're in mourning.

320
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,891
Is it so obvious?

321
00:49:08,524 --> 00:49:10,416
Was it a woman?

322
00:49:11,858 --> 00:49:13,688
It's no sin to love a woman.

323
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:15,413
I have sworn to god.

324
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:18,814
A man needs more than divine love to sustain him.

325
00:49:19,274 --> 00:49:21,893
And he shouldn't be punished for wanting it.

326
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:26,016
Do you have a husband?

327
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:30,096
My husband is dead.
- I'm sorry.

328
00:49:32,066 --> 00:49:33,856
Take off your clothes.

329
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:37,436
I need to dress your wound.

330
00:50:09,525 --> 00:50:11,729
The pain is going already.

331
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:14,395
It's extraordinary, the pain is gone.

332
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:16,764
It is a strong remedy.

333
00:50:21,691 --> 00:50:24,061
May I ask you, how did your husband die?

334
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:25,998
Men like you killed him.

335
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,421
Men like me?

336
00:50:29,608 --> 00:50:31,931
Men of God.

337
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,063
This church has not seen worship for a long while.

338
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:40,062
The woman you went with ...
- She dressed my wounds, nothing more.

339
00:51:42,317 --> 00:51:44,452
Nothing here is what it seems.

340
00:51:44,775 --> 00:51:46,813
You can help us keep warm, girls.

341
00:51:51,213 --> 00:51:52,871
Child.

342
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,017
I found it.

343
00:52:05,234 --> 00:52:08,231
Where?
- In the marsh.

344
00:52:15,484 --> 00:52:18,849
Every village we rode through had graveyards bursting.

345
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:22,190
No corpse-fueled pits, no burning bodies.

346
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,971
We cannot judge them for having no disease.

347
00:52:25,192 --> 00:52:28,190
A party was send before us charged with the same task ...

348
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,019
four men, none returned.

349
00:52:31,234 --> 00:52:33,473
They were lead by a man like myself.

350
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:39,560
This symbol is worn only by the bishops envoy.

351
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:42,979
The girl wore its twin.

352
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:20,147
Please welcome our guests. What is ours is now yours.

353
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:22,515
To our guests. 'TO OUR GUESTS'

354
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:27,561
We also want to give thanks that we've been spared the terrible pestilence ...

355
00:53:27,776 --> 00:53:30,311
sweeping through the land.

356
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:37,814
If I may ...

357
00:53:39,526 --> 00:53:42,938
I would like to express our gratitude for your welcome.

358
00:53:49,734 --> 00:53:51,606
Now let us pray.

359
00:53:51,817 --> 00:53:55,941
Pater noster qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum.
[Our father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name.]

360
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:58,313
Adveniat regnum tuum.
[Your kingdom come.]

361
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:02,140
Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra ...
[Thy will be done on earth both in heaven ...]

362
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:05,974
Panem nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie.
[Give us this day our daily bread.]

363
00:54:08,317 --> 00:54:14,432
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.
[And forgive us our debts, we also forgive our debtors.]

364
00:54:16,776 --> 00:54:18,565
Amen.
- Amen.

365
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:23,057
I expected grace not the entire Lord's Prayer.

366
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:37,734
Women outnumber men here. Maybe that's why a woman speaks for them.

367
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:40,099
Do not be fooled.

368
00:54:40,901 --> 00:54:44,349
Evil works within this place,
within these people.

369
00:54:58,776 --> 00:55:00,434
Osmund.

370
00:55:02,068 --> 00:55:04,224
I just need some air.

371
00:55:15,776 --> 00:55:18,016
We found her in the forrest.

372
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,060
She spoke of you before she died.

373
00:56:22,235 --> 00:56:24,984
Forgive me Lord. I am angry.

374
00:56:29,235 --> 00:56:31,558
Why did you take her?

375
00:56:34,943 --> 00:56:36,898
Why did you take her?

376
00:57:09,902 --> 00:57:11,985
Osmund, where were you?

377
00:57:16,735 --> 00:57:18,642
Why did you betray me?

378
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,768
Why?

379
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:26,433
Why did you betray me?

380
00:57:28,152 --> 00:57:30,438
Osmund? Osmund?

381
00:57:30,694 --> 00:57:32,151
Osmund.

382
00:57:36,027 --> 00:57:37,224
Osmund?

383
00:57:37,444 --> 00:57:40,809
What troubles you?
- We're to become beasts.

384
00:57:41,027 --> 00:57:43,978
We must become more than beasts if we are to triumph here.

385
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:48,747
I see no evil here, just a simple village that has not yet been ravished.

386
00:57:48,748 --> 00:57:51,592
Leave a suffering to your heart daunt your senses.

387
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,608
Sir, how would you know, you have no heart to suffer.

388
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:56,856
I have known grief.

389
00:57:57,069 --> 00:58:00,102
My wife and child sit at God's side.

390
00:58:11,527 --> 00:58:13,103
Yes ...

391
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:16,731
this village is without the pestilence.

392
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:20,444
But it is also without God.

393
00:58:21,485 --> 00:58:25,314
For this they will suffer.

394
00:58:54,027 --> 00:58:55,899
Are you shy?

395
00:59:00,694 --> 00:59:04,439
I am ugly and I am Christian.

396
00:59:04,652 --> 00:59:07,401
And that is not a good combination in here.

397
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:10,359
Hm? Piss off.

398
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:30,982
When will she be buried?

399
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:34,311
Do not worry.
I will take care of everything.

400
00:59:34,944 --> 00:59:36,734
Can I see her again?

401
00:59:36,944 --> 00:59:38,734
You will.

402
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:52,481
You were going to tell me these men mean us harm.

403
00:59:52,694 --> 00:59:55,064
Me in particular.

404
00:59:55,778 --> 00:59:59,190
I knew the moment I looked into Ulrics eyes.

405
00:59:59,403 --> 01:00:02,484
But I did not know with whose side you were on.

406
01:00:04,236 --> 01:00:05,859
Come with me.

407
01:00:09,444 --> 01:00:10,985
Come.

408
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,859
What's going on?

409
01:00:47,278 --> 01:00:49,601
Something you should see.

410
01:01:14,528 --> 01:01:16,194
Now.

411
01:03:32,404 --> 01:03:33,813
What's wrong?

412
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:36,355
Get off.

413
01:03:52,445 --> 01:03:54,732
Eat and drink.

414
01:04:09,404 --> 01:04:13,314
As a Christian you'll appreciate the concept of betrayal.

415
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:11,613
Together... Keep your head together.

416
01:05:12,092 --> 01:05:13,154
Keep it together.
- Get lost.

417
01:05:13,269 --> 01:05:14,519
Keep it together.
- Get lost.

418
01:05:14,633 --> 01:05:16,113
Keep your head together.

419
01:05:18,696 --> 01:05:19,726
Stop! Piss off!

420
01:05:19,946 --> 01:05:23,939
You're not there boy. Look at me boy. Look at me!

421
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:51,150
Come on, boy.

422
01:06:04,654 --> 01:06:06,231
Whore!

423
01:06:07,279 --> 01:06:09,187
WHORE!

424
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:28,987
These Christians arrived in our village claiming to seek refuge.

425
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,484
This was their true purpose.

426
01:06:32,696 --> 01:06:37,235
They came uninvited to our home
bringing malice and hatred.

427
01:06:37,446 --> 01:06:39,899
These are God's gifts to us.

428
01:06:40,113 --> 01:06:42,399
These are his words ...

429
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,277
and these fine men his ambassadors.

430
01:06:47,571 --> 01:06:52,232
Thirteen centuries of control and intimidation ...

431
01:06:52,238 --> 01:06:55,397
now gaze back at us through those bars.

432
01:07:28,905 --> 01:07:31,191
We do not relish suffering.

433
01:07:31,405 --> 01:07:34,072
We do what we must to keep us safe.

434
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:42,190
The pestilence, the Christian disease, send by your god to ravage his own people.

435
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:46,351
By spilling your Christian blood the pestilence is kept away.

436
01:07:46,572 --> 01:07:50,269
You and your flock, you believe that blasphemous filth?

437
01:07:50,488 --> 01:07:53,190
Kill us now, you bitch. Get it over with.

438
01:07:53,405 --> 01:07:56,438
I will offer you all the chance to live.

439
01:07:58,197 --> 01:08:01,313
Renounce your vengeful God, and you will be free.

440
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:05,149
Keep him and you will die.

441
01:08:05,363 --> 01:08:08,480
Not one man here will bow down to you.

442
01:08:09,947 --> 01:08:13,727
I will die first.
- Who wants to live?

443
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,396
You?

444
01:08:17,572 --> 01:08:20,653
I will fight Ulric for the right to die first.

445
01:08:23,489 --> 01:08:25,278
Choose one.

446
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,651
You will renounce.

447
01:09:00,114 --> 01:09:03,894
I look forward to shagging your mother's ass in hell.

448
01:09:04,864 --> 01:09:09,984
My mother is alive and she doesn't relish the company of soldiers.

449
01:09:14,447 --> 01:09:16,070
Come on.

450
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,987
Come on, men.

451
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:20,686
Die well my friend.
- Oh, I will.

452
01:09:20,905 --> 01:09:22,482
Come on.

453
01:09:23,114 --> 01:09:26,396
My lady love and I, we lived in joyeous sin..

454
01:09:26,614 --> 01:09:30,560
Now my lady love has got the blackened skin.

455
01:09:30,781 --> 01:09:34,561
Lady love and I, we pour our love so brave...

456
01:09:34,781 --> 01:09:36,154
She says yeah.

457
01:09:36,364 --> 01:09:39,795
Now my lady love rots in an early grave.

458
01:09:40,005 --> 01:09:44,060
My lady love and I, we lived in joyeous sin..

459
01:09:44,135 --> 01:09:45,751
Now you will learn about pain.

460
01:09:45,968 --> 01:09:49,713
...Nothing you can teach me about pain.

461
01:09:55,364 --> 01:09:57,687
Don't look. Don't look. Hey, look away.

462
01:09:57,906 --> 01:09:59,778
Look away, boy.

463
01:10:05,656 --> 01:10:10,360
Blood of our blood, unholy trinity divine ...

464
01:10:10,864 --> 01:10:14,644
we offer this lamb slaughtering down ...

465
01:10:15,614 --> 01:10:19,311
that death not ours shall stay afar.

466
01:10:22,031 --> 01:10:26,025
For Christian blood, putrid and sick ...

467
01:10:26,906 --> 01:10:30,520
into our marsh shall weep.

468
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:59,405
Bitch. You bitch. I'll fucking kill you, you bitch.

469
01:10:59,781 --> 01:11:02,732
I'll slice you open. Do you hear me?

470
01:11:02,948 --> 01:11:06,313
I'll fucking slice you open. I don't fuck.

471
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,403
Choose another.

472
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,194
I will renounce.

473
01:11:27,406 --> 01:11:29,646
No. No, you won't. You won't.

474
01:11:29,864 --> 01:11:33,561
You try to leave this ...
I'll kill you with my bare fucking hands.

475
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:36,483
I swear, I do.

476
01:11:36,494 --> 01:11:37,660
No.

477
01:11:37,661 --> 01:11:41,222
Swire, listen to me. If you renounce, you burn in hell.

478
01:11:41,223 --> 01:11:45,466
You ...
- My Friend you'll burn in hell.

479
01:11:49,365 --> 01:11:51,900
He's going to kill you.

480
01:11:53,073 --> 01:11:56,190
I swear to god, they're going to kill you.

481
01:11:56,823 --> 01:12:01,148
Swire, stop, nooo.
- I swear to god, they're going to kill you.

482
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,895
God, begone.
I do renounce thee eternally.

483
01:12:25,948 --> 01:12:29,728
God, begone.

484
01:12:29,948 --> 01:12:32,152
I do renounce thee eternally.

485
01:12:32,365 --> 01:12:35,232
Holy Ghost, begone eternally.

486
01:12:35,448 --> 01:12:38,944
Holy Ghost, begone eternally.

487
01:12:39,156 --> 01:12:42,439
Christ, begone eternally.

488
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:46,738
Christ ...

489
01:12:46,948 --> 01:12:48,903
begone eternally.

490
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,947
The false idols have been cast out.

491
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:55,854
God is gone.

492
01:12:56,073 --> 01:12:59,024
The Holy Ghost is gone.

493
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,108
Christ is gone.

494
01:13:05,032 --> 01:13:08,278
These men will escort you
to the edge of the village.

495
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,445
You are free to go.

496
01:13:18,407 --> 01:13:19,297
Where are we going?

497
01:13:20,073 --> 01:13:20,860
Where are we going?

498
01:13:21,073 --> 01:13:22,592
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

499
01:13:22,844 --> 01:13:25,196
WHERE ARE WE GO... AAAHHH, NO!

500
01:13:38,573 --> 01:13:40,363
Osmund.

501
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:45,232
You will renounce.
- Leave the boy. LEAVE THE BOY!

502
01:13:45,448 --> 01:13:49,110
Leave the boy and take a man.

503
01:13:49,323 --> 01:13:51,480
He's a boy!

504
01:13:52,324 --> 01:13:54,990
He's a boy! He's a boy!

505
01:14:01,657 --> 01:14:06,610
These monks came to restore our faith.

506
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:10,401
Today he will abandon his own.

507
01:14:11,407 --> 01:14:14,239
Inside that cottage is the woman he loves.

508
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:18,857
I 've brought her back to him.
- God, I am dead, I'm in hell.

509
01:14:19,074 --> 01:14:23,150
No Osmund, you left hell behind when you crossed our marsh.

510
01:14:24,324 --> 01:14:26,812
Come live here with us.

511
01:14:27,032 --> 01:14:29,402
Come live with the woman you love.

512
01:14:29,615 --> 01:14:31,606
We have no fury.

513
01:14:31,824 --> 01:14:35,071
We have no pestilence. We have no God.

514
01:14:35,282 --> 01:14:38,315
Why are you doing this to me?

515
01:14:38,532 --> 01:14:40,736
Because I like you.

516
01:14:45,574 --> 01:14:48,062
Renounce, and you will be together.

517
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:51,178
Go.

518
01:14:51,949 --> 01:14:53,511
Go.

519
01:14:57,241 --> 01:14:59,694
Osmund. Osmund.

520
01:14:59,907 --> 01:15:01,862
Do not be tempted.

521
01:15:02,074 --> 01:15:05,486
It is not her. IT IS NOT HER!

522
01:15:06,866 --> 01:15:08,323
Osmund.

523
01:15:08,532 --> 01:15:09,906
Osmund.

524
01:16:16,866 --> 01:16:18,145
Averill.

525
01:16:23,449 --> 01:16:25,156
No, come here.

526
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:28,698
No, Averill.

527
01:16:44,574 --> 01:16:46,233
Averill, look at me.

528
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:57,817
It is alright.

529
01:16:58,533 --> 01:17:00,322
It's alright.

530
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,488
You're with God.

531
01:17:02,699 --> 01:17:04,690
You're with God.

532
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:09,819
And very soon, i'll be with you. I promise you.

533
01:17:10,533 --> 01:17:13,152
I promise you.

534
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:29,487
I love you, Averill.

535
01:17:32,866 --> 01:17:35,023
In nomine patris ...

536
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:37,315
et filii ...

537
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:40,235
et spiritus sancti. Amen.

538
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:04,403
Averill is with God.

539
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,398
And so am I.

540
01:19:11,908 --> 01:19:14,397
This shows how cruel they are.

541
01:19:14,617 --> 01:19:18,278
Even the ones they love are slaughtered in God's name.

542
01:19:27,617 --> 01:19:31,860
The boy will not renounce.

543
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,815
You have no power here. You have no power here.

544
01:19:37,659 --> 01:19:40,361
Hob, crucify them all.

545
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:44,783
You can not tear a true man of God away from his faith.

546
01:19:45,492 --> 01:19:49,438
I do not fear you, nor your pagan lapdog.

547
01:19:51,075 --> 01:19:52,734
Finished?

548
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,358
Bring out the horses.

549
01:20:07,575 --> 01:20:11,735
Crucify us and you shall be spared.

550
01:20:13,159 --> 01:20:15,445
That is the creed of your witch.

551
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:18,573
You came to our land bringing death.

552
01:20:18,784 --> 01:20:21,450
For once you speak the truth.

553
01:20:21,659 --> 01:20:24,326
We came bringing death.

554
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:28,439
She cannot protect you from God's wrath.

555
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:32,525
Repent! Before it is too late.

556
01:20:32,951 --> 01:20:34,609
Hit it.

557
01:20:34,826 --> 01:20:36,484
Repent!

558
01:20:52,201 --> 01:20:54,191
You will renounce.

559
01:20:55,326 --> 01:20:56,605
Never.

560
01:21:01,409 --> 01:21:03,732
No! No!

561
01:21:08,201 --> 01:21:09,658
Never.

562
01:21:36,534 --> 01:21:38,075
Stop!

563
01:21:51,284 --> 01:21:53,192
Let me see the boy.

564
01:22:14,951 --> 01:22:17,072
You did well.

565
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,280
Come on, come on, come.

566
01:22:25,659 --> 01:22:28,444
They will all die by God's hand.

567
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:34,155
Open my shirt.

568
01:22:39,118 --> 01:22:41,357
Open my shirt.

569
01:22:58,576 --> 01:23:00,532
I am Death.

570
01:23:02,035 --> 01:23:03,693
Vengeance is mine.

571
01:23:06,576 --> 01:23:10,404
God's fury rains down on you.

572
01:23:11,243 --> 01:23:13,399
God is restored.

573
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,901
Run.

574
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:06,859
Where are you?

575
01:25:55,952 --> 01:25:59,863
Hell awaits you with open arms.
- There is no hell.

576
01:26:00,077 --> 01:26:03,608
Well, heaven doesn't want you.
- There is no heaven.

577
01:26:03,827 --> 01:26:07,275
Why, why follow her?

578
01:26:07,494 --> 01:26:10,243
Because she was beautiful.

579
01:26:11,244 --> 01:26:13,281
And real.

580
01:26:13,494 --> 01:26:15,650
This ...

581
01:26:15,869 --> 01:26:18,025
is real.

582
01:26:26,994 --> 01:26:32,066
There is no God.

583
01:26:37,161 --> 01:26:38,784
Where are you?

584
01:26:51,952 --> 01:26:53,659
Where are you?

585
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,114
Thou shall not kill ...

586
01:26:58,328 --> 01:27:00,235
Remember?

587
01:27:01,661 --> 01:27:03,367
Remember?

588
01:27:03,578 --> 01:27:06,196
Averill was in purgatory.

589
01:27:06,411 --> 01:27:08,899
Perhaps in your twisted mind.

590
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:12,532
Did you never think that maybe Averill was never dead?

591
01:27:14,953 --> 01:27:18,816
We found her in the forrest, injured but very much alive.

592
01:27:19,036 --> 01:27:20,908
You know that is not true.

593
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:25,444
Yes Osmund. Averill was never dead. She was alive.

594
01:27:26,911 --> 01:27:28,949
I drugged her.

595
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,825
I drugged her.

596
01:27:43,994 --> 01:27:45,368
So wh.., why ...

597
01:27:45,578 --> 01:27:48,529
Why would you do that? Why would you bury her?

598
01:27:48,744 --> 01:27:51,280
Because people need miracles.

599
01:27:51,494 --> 01:27:55,819
And they worship the miracle makers, whoever they might be.

600
01:27:59,786 --> 01:28:03,068
The people in this village believed in me.

601
01:28:03,286 --> 01:28:06,734
And so did you.
- No, Averill was dead.

602
01:28:06,953 --> 01:28:09,192
You killed her.

603
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,075
Averill was dead.

604
01:28:21,286 --> 01:28:23,076
She was dead.

605
01:28:29,328 --> 01:28:31,365
Bring her back.

606
01:28:33,411 --> 01:28:36,160
I beg you, bring her back.

607
01:28:37,453 --> 01:28:40,072
No, I can't.

608
01:28:40,578 --> 01:28:42,485
Pray to your God.

609
01:28:42,995 --> 01:28:45,448
See what he can do.

610
01:28:54,328 --> 01:28:56,153
She was dead.

611
01:29:22,328 --> 01:29:27,779
There is nothing beautiful or uplifting in returning people to God.

612
01:29:30,203 --> 01:29:33,569
There is no place in heaven for those who kill.

613
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:39,984
The pestilence claimed no higher purpose.

614
01:29:40,203 --> 01:29:46,449
And those who had survived our swords that day soon fell foul of its sighs.

615
01:29:47,953 --> 01:29:51,236
They were not protected by the witch.

616
01:29:51,453 --> 01:29:53,823
They were simply remote.

617
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:57,950
And once the pestilence crossed their marsh ...

618
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:00,943
it killed them too.

619
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:22,785
Osmund.

620
01:30:23,912 --> 01:30:25,618
Osmund.

621
01:30:27,745 --> 01:30:29,321
We're here.

622
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,410
Osmund.

623
01:30:48,995 --> 01:30:52,159
That you've returned safe is a miracle.

624
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:58,695
Who is that?
- It's a necromancer that I'll be delivering to the bishop.

625
01:31:00,995 --> 01:31:03,566
Here, thats ...

626
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,910
How many of you are left.

627
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,400
Enough.

628
01:31:18,662 --> 01:31:20,487
Look after him.

629
01:31:21,537 --> 01:31:23,611
There's no need.

630
01:31:24,787 --> 01:31:27,276
He is back with God.

631
01:31:48,037 --> 01:31:50,952
I never saw him again.

632
01:31:51,162 --> 01:31:54,113
I heard stories.

633
01:31:54,329 --> 01:31:56,284
Dark stories.

634
01:31:57,371 --> 01:32:02,822
That in the years that followed Osmunds heart turned cold.

635
01:32:03,037 --> 01:32:07,362
That in the shadow of his grief he found a hate.

636
01:32:07,579 --> 01:32:09,324
And that in God's name ...

637
01:32:09,537 --> 01:32:14,868
he took up the sword and vengeance became his creed.

638
01:32:20,996 --> 01:32:22,903
Can I help you?

639
01:32:40,663 --> 01:32:42,239
Please.

640
01:32:43,079 --> 01:32:44,489
Please.

641
01:32:47,163 --> 01:32:49,486
I 've done nothing wrong.

642
01:32:51,663 --> 01:32:53,369
Please.

643
01:32:53,663 --> 01:32:54,704
Please.

644
01:32:57,621 --> 01:33:00,156
You have the wrong woman.

645
01:33:02,746 --> 01:33:05,697
I want a confession, and i want her alive.

646
01:33:49,705 --> 01:33:51,162
Osmund.

647
01:33:51,663 --> 01:33:53,405
She won't confess.

648
01:33:53,621 --> 01:33:55,991
Are you sure she's a witch?

649
01:34:02,538 --> 01:34:04,659
Where is she?

650
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:13,867
Some say he found the witch ...

651
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,161
and that he tortured her and burned her.

652
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:24,488
Others say it was never her ...

653
01:34:27,121 --> 01:34:31,446
it was only her guilt he saw in the eyes of the accused.

654
01:34:57,788 --> 01:35:00,158
I like to think that he found peace ...

655
01:35:01,622 --> 01:35:05,615
that he continued seeing beauty in the world ...

656
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:07,536
goodness.
