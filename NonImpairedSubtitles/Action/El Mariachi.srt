1
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,150
Yes.

2
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,874
Yes.

3
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,678
You know what to do.

4
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,190
Good morning, Azul.

5
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:27,116
- Do you know who this is?
- Moco...

6
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:31,272
- It's been years. What do you want?
- I'm a few towns away...

7
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,115
...with a whole new gang.
I heard you were locked up nearby -

8
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:38,793
- so I decided to call, my friend.

9
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,350
That was nice of you, you pig!

10
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,831
Get me out of here
and give me my share of the money.

11
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:53,027
- I got you where you are.
- Should I really get you out?

12
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,193
I know you're doing business from
your cell with some loyal men, -

13
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:01,795
- a mobile phone and the protection
that prison offers.

14
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,191
Not a bad idea.
Maybe someday I'll give it a try.

15
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,557
You owe me a fortune.
In here I make peanuts.

16
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,509
You know it.
So help me out...my friend.

17
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,428
Soon, Azul. Soon.

18
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:23,433
I'm sending some friends to get you.

19
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:27,308
In a few days.

20
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:33,076
That's more like it.
Just like the Moco I used to know.

21
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,670
Hang in there.

22
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,835
I won't forget that you've been
a big part of our triumph.

23
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:48,557
What's going on, Moco?

24
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,791
Getting me out today?

25
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:12,031
There are three armed men.
Did you send them?

26
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,276
I'm still here. And so are
your friends. But not for long.

27
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,990
They have something they want
to scream to you. Listen close.

28
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:41,469
You'll repeat it to me
when I visit you.

29
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,628
That morning
was just like any other.

30
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,191
No love, no luck.

31
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,147
No ride.

32
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,472
No change.

33
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:05,352
I came across a turtle
on the highway.

34
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:17,189
We were both taking our time
getting to where we were going.

35
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:23,992
What I didn't know
was that my time was running out.

36
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:07,514
Free coconuts...
I was beginning to like this city.

37
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,190
I always wanted to be a "mariachi".

38
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:32,029
Like my father, my grandfather
and my great-grandfather.

39
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:37,432
I'm not as good as them yet,
but I'm improving.

40
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,595
I planned to follow their footsteps
to the end. Die with my guitar.

41
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:49,594
I played from town to town,
picking up experience.

42
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:00,718
This town was my next stop.

43
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,196
The free coconut
at the edge of town -

44
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:09,591
- made me feel
this place would bring good luck.

45
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,751
But I was wrong.

46
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:34,268
- What'll it be?
- A soda.

47
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,835
- A little music?
- Why?

48
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,308
I'm a mariachi. A good one.

49
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:10,998
I play ballads, love songs...
A few originals.

50
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,313
- What do I care?
- I could add class to the place.

51
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:21,109
I work for next to nothing.
I live mostly from tips.

52
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,589
But I need steady work.

53
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,513
I guarantee
you'll get more customers.

54
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:34,356
Why would I want one mariachi
when I have a whole band?

55
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,398
You see? I only pay one guy
and I have a whole mariachi band.

56
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,834
Understand?

57
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,472
Thanks.

58
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:54,553
If you want to earn a real living,
get yourself a real instrument.

59
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,836
Idiot...

60
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,876
What the hell is this?
Mariachi day?

61
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,032
There's no work for you, either.

62
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:47,874
Bartender...A beer.

63
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,434
In a bottle.

64
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,229
I'm looking for an old friend.

65
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,232
His name is...Moco.

66
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,756
- Where is he?
- Sometimes he's here.

67
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,592
He owns the place.

68
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,072
- So you know him?
- Of course, we work for him.

69
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,957
That's too bad...

70
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,509
Hold this.

71
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,715
What the hell is going on?

72
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:29,918
- Say something!
- Moco!

73
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:51,189
Give me the phone.

74
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,156
Take it.

75
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,512
Moco?

76
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,354
Dead? All of them?

77
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,352
How long ago?

78
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,274
What does he look like?

79
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:24,428
Carrying a guitar case?

80
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,829
Dressed in black?

81
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,388
Don't worry, Moco.

82
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:37,316
We'll find him, kill him,
and feed him to the dogs.

83
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:41,631
If you see someone dressed in black,
with a guitar case...

84
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,395
Call this number. His name is Azul.

85
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,110
And if I don't call,
you'll kill me, right?

86
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,991
I won't. He will.

87
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:07,877
I was beginning to realise
this town had no luck.

88
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:12,078
What happened to the days
when guitarists were gods?

89
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:15,072
Like my forefathers.

90
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:20,074
Technology has crushed us...

91
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:23,470
...and robbed us of our culture.

92
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,951
Turned us into machines.

93
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,034
She was the most beautiful creature
I'd seen that day.

94
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,759
Next to the turtle, of course.

95
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:42,109
- What can I get you?
- A soda.

96
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:45,635
Soda? Are you a little boy, or what?

97
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:49,838
I'm a musician.
I can't drink or smoke.

98
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,150
My voice is my life.

99
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,072
Cheers.

100
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:58,790
I work for next to nothing.

101
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:03,874
I live mostly off tips.
But I need steady work.

102
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,758
- Where?
- Here, in your bar.

103
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,674
No, I don't have the money
for a mariachi.

104
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,958
This isn't my day.

105
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,314
What?

106
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:20,277
Thanks.

107
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:35,672
I need a cheap room for the week.

108
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:42,278
I'm looking for work.
Can I pay you later?

109
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,434
Yeah, pay me later.

110
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:53,159
Thanks.

111
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,477
Excuse me,
but could you leave a deposit?

112
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:03,756
You don't trust me?

113
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,152
Sorry...
How much can you give me?

114
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,989
Not much.
I only have a few pesos.

115
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,675
That's fine. Have a nice day.
Thanks.

116
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:47,994
No, not there. Room ten.

117
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:11,749
There!

118
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,113
He's wearing black. Find him!

119
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,910
Here he is!

120
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,673
What happened, mariachi?
Too much soda?

121
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:36,991
I just killed four men.

122
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:42,391
Is that true?

123
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:53,076
- Wait! What's your name?
- Domino.

124
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:57,278
Wait, Domino.
It was self-defence.

125
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:03,629
I'm not from here.
I don't know anyone.

126
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,235
No friends...

127
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:10,596
No enemies...

128
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,153
- Were they thieves?
- I don't think so.

129
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,914
Four men.

130
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,956
I was staying at a cheap hotel.

131
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:31,748
Nothing of value. No money.

132
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,514
They just wanted to kill me.

133
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,070
Then why come here?
So they can kill me, too?

134
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:45,108
I need a place to stay
until this passes over.

135
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,797
They think I'm someone else.
I'm just a mariachi.

136
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:57,393
I've got a room up there.
Don't touch anything.

137
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:01,871
I'll be up later.
Then we'll call a friend of mine.

138
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:09,394
Thank you.
I'll never forget this.

139
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,676
It's over there.

140
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,713
Watch out for my pit bulls.

141
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:11,637
- Hello, Domino.
- What is it?

142
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,872
Give me the phone.
I have to call Moco.

143
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,153
Domino...Has anyone strange
come around here?

144
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,839
Strange people always come here.

145
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:34,629
- Dressed in black, guitar case?
- No.

146
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,950
He killed ten of our men.

147
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:41,589
All in just one day.

148
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,435
- Aren't you gonna call your boss?
- Give me a drink first.

149
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,598
Moco...He got away.

150
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:33,196
He shot at me.
And he killed several of our men.

151
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,750
He's bad news.
I didn't get a good look at him.

152
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,548
If he changes his disguise
I won't recognise him.

153
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,516
Don't worry.

154
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,548
One thing I know. He always carries
a guitar and dresses in black.

155
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,198
It's his thing.

156
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:54,591
But...it's not a guitar.

157
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,192
It's a guitar case full of weapons.

158
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:17,669
- What is it?
- It's not a guitar.

159
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,670
It's a case full of weapons.

160
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,548
He uses it on his victims.

161
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:28,713
Goodbye.
Thanks for the drink.

162
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,189
I'll be right back.

163
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,639
- I said not to touch anything.
- I was trying to relax.

164
00:35:55,799 --> 00:36:01,351
- I can get out...
- No...Finish up.

165
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:06,673
- Want some shampoo?
- Yes, thanks.

166
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,349
- Who are you?
- I'm a musician.

167
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,636
What do you have there?

168
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:41,996
- Guns, knives?
- My guitar.

169
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,309
We'll see...

170
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:50,477
You're modest, mariachi.

171
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,312
You said you killed four men.

172
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:56,869
But you really killed ten.

173
00:36:57,879 --> 00:37:00,951
Don't you even want to look?

174
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,390
Play!

175
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:14,869
Play! Sing!

176
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:19,155
Play!

177
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:27,519
Sing!

178
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:14,595
That was the best I ever played.

179
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,954
You inspired me.

180
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,998
You are a mariachi.

181
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,115
And a good one.

182
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:27,636
- Then hire me.
- I can't. I have no money.

183
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:31,155
This fancy place, and no money?

184
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:33,674
It's true.

185
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:40,667
Pay me room and board.

186
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:45,071
Would I have to keep the knife
between your legs for inspiration?

187
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:50,472
If I stay here? No.
Just until I find permanent work.

188
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:56,077
You won't find work in this town,
but okay.

189
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:10,074
You'll need a better sense of humour
if you plan to work for me.

190
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:13,675
This is a letter opener.

191
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:45,834
Yes?

192
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:48,638
One moment.

193
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:04,077
My friend...You haven't
answered the phone all day.

194
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,357
You were busy killing ten of my men.

195
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:13,115
Six.
I've only killed six.

196
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:17,716
You were always bad at math.
You thought it was all for you.

197
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:22,509
I knew half was yours.
I got carried away. But you...

198
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:26,354
...you're modest.
You killed ten of my men.

199
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,592
I killed six.
Tomorrow I'll double the body count.

200
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:32,715
I was greedy.

201
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:37,236
But business is business.
It would have been cheaper for me -

202
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:41,597
- if I'd paid you.
Now I have to find ten more men.

203
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:44,193
- Six!
- Ten!

204
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:50,036
Give me my money and I won't kill
anyone else. I'll even spare you.

205
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,111
No, it's too late for that.

206
00:40:53,279 --> 00:40:55,747
We'll have to see this through.

207
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:59,673
Just like the Moco I used to know.

208
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,512
Still wearing white?

209
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:08,028
Why?

210
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,312
I see a white suit,
soaked with blood.

211
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,835
Ready to play?
We're waiting for you.

212
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,388
I'm coming.

213
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:14,431
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks.

214
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,111
Hurry up!

215
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:55,879
This song is called
"Ganas de Vivir".

216
00:45:56,759 --> 00:45:59,910
Are you sure it's okay
for me to sleep here?

217
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,310
As long as you stay on your side.

218
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:06,630
Remember, I have this...

219
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:09,871
And him.

220
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:21,875
The first song you played...
It was an original, wasn't it?

221
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:23,518
How did you know?

222
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,877
It seemed like you wrote it
for someone.

223
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:34,752
That's right.

224
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:42,393
Well...

225
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,074
Sweet dreams.

226
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:52,037
I have to get my money
at the hotel.

227
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:55,794
I'll be right back.

228
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:10,836
Watch my things.

229
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:39,710
Hi, it's Domino.

230
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,591
I know.

231
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:12,038
I can't get it open.

232
00:49:28,919 --> 00:49:32,036
Scumbag...

233
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:01,232
- Hello. What can I get you?
- A beer.

234
00:50:07,279 --> 00:50:10,555
In a bottle.

235
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:27,871
- Isn't there a girl who works here?
- She's the owner. She'll be back.

236
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:33,067
She's the owner?
Then she must be Moco's girl.

237
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:38,074
I don't know.
She hangs around with a musician.

238
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:43,234
Thanks.

239
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:12,871
I just saw a guy with a case
like mine. It's him they want.

240
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,349
- He didn't say anything?
- No, he only drank.

241
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:20,273
I don't look anything like him.

242
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:49,477
Let's go. He can take all three.

243
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:54,429
- Is it him?
- I'm not sure.

244
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:57,875
- What's in the case?
- My guitar.

245
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:02,715
- Don't tell me you're a mariachi.
- Yes, I am.

246
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:06,197
Open it.

247
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:11,516
If it's a guitar, you can go.

248
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,912
But if it's not...
we're gonna mess you up real bad.

249
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:26,718
Go on!

250
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:36,193
Don't carry your guitar around
until it's over.

251
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:42,468
- It's the other guy they want.
- I better put it upstairs.

252
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,629
What's wrong?

253
00:52:54,919 --> 00:52:57,797
What's wrong?

254
00:53:11,399 --> 00:53:13,594
Look!

255
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:25,837
It's him!

256
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:54,797
- Sorry...
- We didn't know what to do.

257
00:55:54,959 --> 00:56:01,478
- We thought you could handle it.
- You thought I could handle it?

258
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:04,836
Against three armed men?

259
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:08,707
With this?

260
00:56:10,439 --> 00:56:15,229
My case got switched
with some stupid mariachi's.

261
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:22,548
- Where's the mariachi?
- He's dead by now.

262
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:26,434
So go find my case!

263
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:51,871
- Where were you when he came in?
- I was on the phone with a friend.

264
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:56,635
- My friend knows what's going on.
- Did you mention me?

265
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:01,315
No. He told me
the man in black is named Azul.

266
00:57:01,479 --> 00:57:05,870
If his name is Azul,
why doesn't he wear blue?

267
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:11,796
I don't know. But he's killing
the men who work for a drug dealer.

268
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:15,793
His name's Mauricio,
but they call him Moco.

269
00:57:15,959 --> 00:57:19,395
Moco sent his men to find Azul.

270
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:25,156
- So what do they want with me?
- Only Moco has seen him before.

271
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:30,029
Azul always wears black
and carries a guitar case.

272
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:34,711
Sounds like you, doesn't it?

273
00:57:34,879 --> 00:57:39,907
Ask your friend to tell Moco
that there's two of us.

274
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,355
A killer and a mariachi.

275
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:48,388
Moco doesn't talk to just anyone.
It's best to stay in.

276
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:54,191
Hide your jacket and case
until this passes over.

277
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,075
He got away,
but I got a good look at him.

278
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,790
He killed Piña and Taco.
He won't get away again. I promise.

279
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:43,836
Are you always closed on Mondays?

280
00:58:45,759 --> 00:58:50,787
- Or is it 'cause I lost my guitar?
- I'm closed Mondays.

281
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:53,712
- Play me?
- Yeah.

282
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:00,119
- Hello?
- Come see me.

283
00:59:00,279 --> 00:59:04,158
I can't.

284
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,347
- Please...
- I don't feel so good.

285
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:21,309
- Have you tried the motorcycle?
- No.

286
00:59:21,479 --> 00:59:24,596
I have to hang up.

287
00:59:42,959 --> 00:59:45,871
- Boyfriend?
- No.

288
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:49,554
- Gringo?
- Yeah.

289
00:59:50,919 --> 00:59:53,797
There's one thing
I don't understand.

290
00:59:53,959 --> 00:59:56,951
You say you're poor.

291
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,668
Then how did you get this bar?

292
01:00:02,279 --> 01:00:04,156
It was a gift.

293
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,152
- From who?
- Mauricio.

294
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:11,028
Moco? The guy who wants me dead?

295
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:14,589
He doesn't want to kill you.
His men confused you with Azul.

296
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:18,718
Same thing.

297
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,828
You know how it is.
When you want to win a girl -

298
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:30,234
- you send her
flowers, candy, jewellery...

299
01:00:30,399 --> 01:00:33,357
...until you win her.

300
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:36,079
Yes...

301
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:38,707
Mauricio gave me flowers.

302
01:00:38,879 --> 01:00:41,473
Then jewellery.

303
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:46,588
He let me work in his bar.
Then he gave me the bar.

304
01:00:47,759 --> 01:00:51,832
What was the last thing he gave you?

305
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:58,752
A motorcycle.

306
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:06,512
He wants me to drive it to his ranch
when I decide to give myself to him.

307
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:09,834
He thinks he can convince me.

308
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,877
Can he?

309
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:15,997
He could have.

310
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:21,350
But not anymore.

311
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,231
Good morning.
Take this.

312
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:21,836
I've saved this up.
Buy a new guitar.

313
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,748
Take it. I didn't say
to buy the best one...

314
01:02:26,919 --> 01:02:30,912
Something temporary,
so you can play tonight.

315
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,990
Look for him.
Black pants, white shirt.

316
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,551
- Where did he go?
- He got in my truck.

317
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:41,109
Bring him around.

318
01:04:57,799 --> 01:05:00,472
That's not him.

319
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:57,592
- Did you find my case?
- We didn't find it.

320
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:03,994
We heard you were caught
and taken to Moco's ranch.

321
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:09,552
- We came to see if it was true.
- They got the mariachi.

322
01:06:47,999 --> 01:06:51,628
- What can I get you?
- A beer.

323
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:08,394
- Anything else?
- My guitar case.

324
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:13,199
Where is he?

325
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:16,078
Where's my case?

326
01:07:18,919 --> 01:07:22,468
- Upstairs.
- Go get it.

327
01:07:55,479 --> 01:07:58,437
If you want to see your mariachi,
come with me.

328
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:04,196
- Why would you help me?
- You know where Moco's ranch is.

329
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:08,716
Let's go.

330
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,232
Mauricio!

331
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:45,317
Play along.

332
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:51,076
- Domino, let's go!
- She's gone.

333
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:56,398
They went to find you.
She gave the case back to him.

334
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:01,715
Open the door or she's dead!

335
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:39,230
I'm sorry.

336
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:42,675
I'm sorry he used you to get to me.

337
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:48,631
Pay up, or I'll soak your clothes
with her blood.

338
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:53,270
Let her go.
I'll give you your money.

339
01:10:05,919 --> 01:10:08,228
Make me a map to Moco's place.

340
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:17,675
What did you do with him?

341
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:22,515
- Who?
- The mariachi they thought was him.

342
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:28,037
That's why you hung up on me
last night.

343
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:33,268
Throwing a party without me?

344
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:36,351
With that musician's hands
all over you!

345
01:10:36,519 --> 01:10:41,354
- Give me my money or she's dead!
- After all I've done for you...

346
01:10:41,519 --> 01:10:44,317
This is my thanks?

347
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:49,189
I've never asked you for anything
until now. Let him go.

348
01:10:51,159 --> 01:10:56,631
- I swear I'll kill her!
- You won't kill her.

349
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:58,949
I will!

350
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,069
You feel sorry for her, don't you?

351
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:31,997
All I wanted was my share.
But you have to kill everyone.

352
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:38,229
That's why you'll never be
as big as me.

353
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:41,072
You have too much heart.

354
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:52,912
You must be the mariachi who came
to my town and killed my men.

355
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:55,957
And stole my girl!

356
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:06,196
You're very talented.

357
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:12,753
Playing your little guitar...
Not anymore!

358
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:29,515
Now get off my property.
And take your hand with you!

359
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:18,519
All I wanted was to be a mariachi
like my ancestors.

360
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:22,797
But the town
I thought would bring me luck -

361
01:15:22,959 --> 01:15:26,156
- brought only a curse.

362
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:32,997
I lost my guitar, my hand and her.

363
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:38,955
I may never
be able to play the guitar again.

364
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:43,032
Without her, I have no love.

365
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,987
But with the dog...
and the weapons...

366
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:53,152
...I'm prepared for the future.

367
01:18:04,599 --> 01:18:08,592
