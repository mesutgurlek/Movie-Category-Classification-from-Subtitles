2
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,499
7:15!

3
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,459
...during the class action suit

4
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,419
against the mother company of Serenity,
the ship that sank off the Belgium coast.

5
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:53,500
The families seeking damages for
the loss of loved ones met a roadblock.

6
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:56,660
One of those families,
The Pieters, were not...

7
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:04,341
Why are you going through my stuff?

8
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:08,461
When I was a kid, and that was a 100
years ago and you'll never be my age,

9
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:11,261
but, we actually...

10
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:15,142
got the report card and took it home
to our parents so they could see it.

11
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:17,901
Mom never went through my stuff.

12
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:21,021
Well, I mean, I'm not mom.
Yeah, no shit!

13
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:22,352
Hey!

14
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:24,781
I can't find my filters.

15
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,102
Well, if you were a filter,
where would you be?

16
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:28,942
I don't even know what that means.

17
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:31,382
If I were a filter...

18
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:36,222
I would be in the cabinet,
on the second shelf.

19
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:42,542
I'm not having you flunk
this semester, young lady!

20
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:45,303
Is that milk in it?

21
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:49,343
Dad, milk enzymes cause food allergies.

22
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:51,343
Mom always used soy.

23
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:53,983
You'd rather drink a
genetically modified bean?

24
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:56,943
Right.

25
00:04:57,744 --> 00:05:01,424
Did you get these kind of
grades in the States? No.

26
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,224
Amy, if we're gonna make this work,
we both have to try.

27
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,824
That's Sadie, I gotta go.

28
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:13,184
It's my awards time already tonight.
Can't forget.

29
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:20,505
Alright.
Don't be late, okay?

30
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:23,066
Alright, and then we'll gonna
talk about this report card.

31
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:25,305
What?

32
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,345
You're not gonna kiss me goodbye?

33
00:05:29,306 --> 00:05:30,826
Sure, of course I was, I was going to.

34
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:55,587
Bonjour, Walter.

35
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:03,667
I got you two sugars this time.
Ah, thanks, Mr. Logan!

36
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,908
I thought Halgate owned the
security devices we're testing.

37
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:18,988
I need you to look at this.

38
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:22,188
You read the number?
Now, look.

39
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:26,809
I checked the patent for
the iris scanner to see

40
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,948
if the original schematic
reveal any weaknesses.

41
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,949
You know what I found?

42
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,070
Somebody made a mistake,
we don't own the patent.

43
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:34,749
No, how can that be?

44
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,309
We must own these devices.
Check the other patents, okay?

45
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:48,270
Let's go.

46
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:52,510
You asked us to review our
security devices for flaws, so...

47
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:56,550
if you don't have the pass code
and wanna smash your way in...

48
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,430
our smart locks burn into
a hard polymer sealant here,

49
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:03,790
that permanently secures the lock.
Okay?

50
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:06,271
We couldn't hack the pass
codes, these algorithms

51
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:08,391
were some of the most
secure we've encountered.

52
00:07:08,552 --> 00:07:09,991
But, we found

53
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:11,791
that if you first inject...

54
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:13,991
it's just a mix of
ordinary household bleach

55
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:16,671
and sulfur compound in the mechanism...

56
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:20,152
Oh, see, I'm sorry, Derek.

57
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,392
Please, go ahead.

58
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:24,472
The lock becomes useless,

59
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:26,432
so we have to find a solution that isn't

60
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:29,392
compromised by ordinary household bleach.

61
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:31,752
Next.

62
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,113
Mr. Kohler?
If you please...

63
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,192
The last system.

64
00:07:35,393 --> 00:07:37,272
Halgate biometric scanner, model H1P,

65
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:41,313
providing level 3 security to U.S.
military facilities in mainland Europe.

66
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:45,393
Now, we tried a variety of
attacks to break in, and...

67
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:49,553
this one was tough, but one proved successful.
We have a montage...

68
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:53,673
of 50 specific irises
in a specific group pattern.

69
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,234
And you're in!
Just brute force.

70
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:05,034
Excellent, Ben.
As always.

71
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,914
Let's fix these flaws quickly, and...

72
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:09,274
please send me the video
along with your report.

73
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:11,514
I'll make sure our people get on this also.

74
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:13,114
Thank you.

75
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:14,916
Derek, you got a second?

76
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:15,866
Yeah, sure, Ben.

77
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:18,496
I think there's something you should know.

78
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,555
Somebody forgot to file
patents on these products.

79
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,395
Patents?
How do you know?

80
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,316
Well, we pulled the original schematics to
see if we could spot any weaknesses, and...

81
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:30,655
Personnel all over the world rely on the fact
that our equipment is secure,

82
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:32,656
and that security is
compromised with somebody...

83
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:34,236
I know what it means, Ben.

84
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:37,556
How bad is it?
Well, we got people looking into it.

85
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:38,717
Okay, well...

86
00:08:38,997 --> 00:08:42,996
Keep on it, keep me informed.
Keep it between us.

87
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:45,996
I look forward to your full
presentation report tonight.

88
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:48,236
Tonight?
Derek, my daughter...

89
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:51,077
Please, Ben, please.

90
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:55,157
What time the next batch get in here?

91
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:59,717
8 a.m.
No, that's fine, I'll be here.

92
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:10,318
Hey, Floyd!
Are you okay to lock up?

93
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,878
Walter's gonna do it.
Okay.

94
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,798
It's eight!
Mr. Logan, you should go home.

95
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,478
Oh, shit.

96
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,838
Hey, Mr. Logan!

97
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,558
Anderlecht win?
No.

98
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,998
They're losing again!

99
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:26,999
Courier's picking that up for
head office in an hour. Okay.

100
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:53,640
Well done, Rosie!

101
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay now, the first prize!

102
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:03,161
A check for 250 euros for best photo essay.

103
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:06,681
Amy Logan, "Homeland".

104
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:24,042
Oh, hi, Mr. Logan.
Hi, Sadie.

105
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,882
Amy won!
She won?

106
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,442
Yeah, she won first prize!

107
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:30,042
Where is she?
Is she up there?

108
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:31,802
She's with some friends.

109
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:35,282
Wait!

110
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:53,804
Amy!

111
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:55,925
Hey!

112
00:10:57,965 --> 00:10:59,204
Hey, I gotta go.

113
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:00,924
What?
I gotta go.

114
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,684
See you.
See you later.

115
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:13,965
Put your seat belt on.

116
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:18,365
Who was that?

117
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:19,965
Nabil.

118
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,645
He's helping me.

119
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,605
Yeah, helping you with what?
"Without Voices."

120
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:26,485
It's my next photo essay.

121
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,166
You know, people making life here because
we screwed up whatever country they're from.

122
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:33,326
Don't get caught up on
other people's problems.

123
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:36,287
Boy, what a world this would be
if everyone thought like you!

124
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:39,849
And you shouldn't be hanging out there.
And you should show up when you say you will.

125
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:46,046
Do you have anything to eat?

126
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:48,247
You know what?

127
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,967
Mei Ling brought you cookies.

128
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:55,487
I thought I don't eat sweets.
It's all I've got.

129
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:58,967
I got the phone bill today.

130
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:01,767
300 euros of calls to your Grandfather?

131
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,088
Has this got peanuts in it?

132
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:06,808
I don't feel so good, dad.

133
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:09,088
You okay?
No.

134
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:09,979
Huh?
No!

135
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:11,888
Okay, hold on.

136
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,329
You can see her.

137
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,769
Doc says you're gonna live.

138
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,490
Told you I had a peanut allergy.
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,810
I should have asked.

140
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:47,570
We have to go to the office
and pick up a delivery.

141
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:49,930
Won't be long.

142
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:55,050
Did I tell you I found a place
we can watch baseball?

143
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,371
In Ghent.
Expat community.

144
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,731
Thought we could go there, hang out.
Fun.

145
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:03,051
I hate baseball.

146
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,772
When your mom and I first met,
we used to go to games all the time.

147
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:12,691
Yeah, if it was so great,
then why'd you leave?

148
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,133
Bonjour, Walter.

149
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:27,933
Bonjour!

150
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:36,234
Walter?

151
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:50,854
Dad?

152
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:54,174
Are we on the right floor?
Come here!

153
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:40,736
Who are you calling?

154
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:42,737
Our office number here.

155
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,057
Shit.

156
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:38,660
What's going on?

157
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,820
Some kind of misunderstanding.
Come on.

158
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:48,380
Dad, your company can't
just pick up and leave.

159
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:52,980
Okay, if you were a company,
where would you hide?

160
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:54,301
Don't start.

161
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,221
We're going to Brussels.

162
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,301
What?

163
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:02,461
An hour to get there,
an hour to clear this up,

164
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:04,461
we'll be back by lunch.

165
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:05,981
Dad, I have school.

166
00:16:06,822 --> 00:16:08,461
You just got the day off.

167
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:25,222
The Halgate group:
A world-wide enterprise bringing the latest

168
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:29,503
technological advances to shipping,
construction and engineering.

169
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:31,244
Bonjour.
Bonjour.

170
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:33,984
I'm here to see Derek Kohler, please.
One moment, please.

171
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:34,983
Thank you.

172
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:37,463
No pictures, young lady.

173
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,543
Sorry.

174
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:45,463
The database is not showing
a Derek Kohler, sir.

175
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,144
That's impossible.
Is there another name you want me to try?

176
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:52,004
Yes, please try again.
It's K-O-L-H-E-R.

177
00:16:52,065 --> 00:16:53,985
Excuse me!
It's very important, please, just...

178
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:56,004
I know he's in the database.
Excuse me!

179
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:56,945
Try it again, will you?

180
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:57,984
Security!

181
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:01,144
I don't know how to say this, Mr. Logan.

182
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:06,425
But you do not, nor have you ever worked
for a subsidiary of this company.

183
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:08,066
We don't even make this kind

184
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:10,905
of security systems.
And we never employed a...

185
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:12,945
a Derek Kohler.

186
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:14,185
Listen to me.

187
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:18,785
A New York based company called "Placement
Solutions" came to me three months ago,

188
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:22,106
said they wanted to open a new
division of The Halgate Group in Europe,

189
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:24,826
as part of their your
private security business.

190
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:29,106
Mr. Logan, you are in the European
headquarters of The Halgate Group.

191
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:32,746
We handle all our recruitment direct.

192
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,866
I need your battery.

193
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:37,826
Mine's dead.

194
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,547
I wanna show you my e-mail.

195
00:17:41,188 --> 00:17:42,027
Thank you.

196
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:59,828
It's my business correspondence.
It's eight weeks in work.

197
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,868
Your business correspondence?
That's right.

198
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:11,988
Your BlackBerry is empty.

199
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,149
We've run a background
check on you, Mr. Logan.

200
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:22,669
Seems you've been living in
Antwerp now, eight weeks,

201
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,389
as you say.

202
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,789
But your last registered
address was New York,

203
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,309
14 years ago.

204
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,470
Before that, Washington D.C. 1989.

205
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:35,630
Since then,

206
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:38,390
no records of any kind exist for you.

207
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:42,030
You've been working for a Halgate
subsidiary which doesn't exist.

208
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:43,431
Testing products we don't make.

209
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:45,810
Reporting to an officer
we have never employed.

210
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,710
I've received paychecks from you.

211
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:52,711
I have received pension,
medical insurance, car insurance.

212
00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:53,752
Mr. Logan...

213
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:55,631
If you were in my shoes,

214
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:57,911
listening to your story,

215
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,711
what would you do?

216
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,193
There must be some sort of mistake. My
salary payments, they should be listed here.

217
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:17,592
I'm afraid that this is all we have,
this is all there is.

218
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:21,112
There is no activity in your account

219
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:22,832
since you opened it.

220
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:39,633
Mr. Logan.
Floyd!

221
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:42,393
Am I glad to see you!
What are you doing here?

222
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,954
The company. Everything is gone!
What's going on?

223
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:49,474
I don't know. My e-mails, bank statements,
my records, everything's gone.

224
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:52,074
Don't make a sound.
No sudden moves.

225
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,394
Hey, can you cash my...

226
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:56,994
check?

227
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:03,835
Why are you doing this, Floyd?
Get on the autoroute.

228
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:13,955
Where are we going?

229
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:15,915
Hands on the wheel.

230
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:19,876
I'll do exactly as you say.

231
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:24,796
Floyd, what happened to the company?

232
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:27,756
Talk to me, Floyd.

233
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,677
Talk to me, damned.
Why are you doing this?

234
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:35,076
Eyes on the road!

235
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,717
Don't hit him.
Shut up!

236
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:38,877
It's okay, baby.

237
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:40,557
Just sit back.

238
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,538
Amy?

239
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:49,758
I thought I told you to always
put your your seatbelt on.

240
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:53,118
Take the third exit.

241
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,518
What are you gonna do?

242
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,398
Who are you working for?

243
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,798
You should have taken my advice, Ben.

244
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,638
I told you to go home.

245
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,198
Now they made me come looking for you.
For both of you.

246
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:10,278
Take this exit.

247
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,599
Take this exit out!
Take it!

248
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,639
It's okay, Amy.

249
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,719
Slow down!
Dad, slow down!

250
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,860
Slow down!

251
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,199
Slow down!

252
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:44,960
Dad, watch out!

253
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:47,001
Dad!

254
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,241
Dad, the wheel!

255
00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:36,563
Dad!

256
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:56,605
Who you're working for, Floyd?

257
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:00,365
I want answers, Floyd.

258
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:03,365
What was waiting for me at home?

259
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,845
Who you're working for?
Who you're working for?

260
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:23,046
Oh, my God!

261
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:37,167
Dad, the cops, they can help us.

262
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:38,928
They can't help us.
Yes, they can!

263
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,247
No, they can't.

264
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:56,088
Come on.

265
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:05,048
Get back!

266
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:30,490
Stay back.

267
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:50,652
Hey, come here, you hurt?
We can't...

268
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:53,211
We can't be here, dad,
this is someone's house!

269
00:24:53,412 --> 00:24:54,731
We won't be here long.

270
00:24:54,932 --> 00:24:56,011
Draw the curtains.

271
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:13,172
You killed him.

272
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:15,612
In self-defense, Amy.

273
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:17,813
No, Dad, this is messed up.

274
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:19,653
This is so messed up!

275
00:25:19,814 --> 00:25:21,373
I need you to help me right now, okay?

276
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,533
Over the top, around the thumb.

277
00:25:26,214 --> 00:25:28,493
We could still go to the police, dad.
They can help us.

278
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:32,253
We should've been at home last night.

279
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:34,213
He wanted us to go home.

280
00:25:34,374 --> 00:25:35,534
What's that?

281
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:37,494
Looks like a locker key.

282
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:38,894
"A.C."

283
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:40,774
"Antwerp Central."

284
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:43,895
You used to work for The State Department.
Why don't you call someone?

285
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:46,334
And tell 'em what?
Someone erased my e-mails,

286
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:49,814
bank records, my life?

287
00:25:57,676 --> 00:25:58,376
Amy!

288
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:01,255
Why would someone you
work with try to kill us?

289
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,855
Amy, listen to me.
I don't know what's going on here.

290
00:26:06,936 --> 00:26:08,455
Come here.

291
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:11,816
The safest place for you to be, right now,

292
00:26:11,977 --> 00:26:15,656
is at my side listening to what I tell you.

293
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:17,216
Will you do that for me?

294
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:21,216
Will you trust me?

295
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,179
Get back.

296
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,059
You see those cameras up there?

297
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:22,620
You keep your head down.

298
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,180
They can't identify you if
they can't get a full profile.

299
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:31,140
I'm going to the lockers.
Wait for me here.

300
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:33,780
Corners are safe.
Dad?

301
00:27:33,941 --> 00:27:36,260
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

302
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:58,148
Where did you get that?
From Floyd's locker.

303
00:29:59,109 --> 00:29:59,949
Mei Ling.

304
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,989
Who are they?

305
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,949
People I work with.

306
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,230
That's my picture.

307
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:21,870
That's a picture of Grandpa
and me in New Haven.

308
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:25,990
How did this guy get this stuff?

309
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:29,390
How can this guy have a picture
of me from four months ago?

310
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:34,150
How can you be so calm?

311
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:36,991
'Cause that's the only way we're
gonna figure out what's going on.

312
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,391
Just let me work this out, okay?

313
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,311
Hassan's.

314
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:47,551
John's.

315
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,311
This is Mei Ling's address.

316
00:30:52,873 --> 00:30:55,632
They all lived within a five mile radius.

317
00:30:57,793 --> 00:30:59,872
What's the nearest hospital to here?

318
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:02,672
Where are we?
Right here.

319
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:06,032
St. Cornelius, right there.

320
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:08,512
St. Cornelius, good job!

321
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:22,073
Mei Ling Hom. Number 452.

322
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,073
Who'd you say she was?

323
00:31:26,154 --> 00:31:27,513
I didn't.

324
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:36,994
You wait out here.
No.

325
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:41,674
This is a morgue, Amy.

326
00:31:42,315 --> 00:31:44,154
Now, my picture was in that file too.

327
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:47,355
Are you coming or what?
You can't be seen out here!

328
00:31:53,716 --> 00:31:55,915
It was like a fire sale yesterday.

329
00:31:56,236 --> 00:31:59,035
Bunch of bodies, coming
in every other hour.

330
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,995
She was found floating in the Scheldt.

331
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:08,316
Blood alcohol level:
Five times the limit.

332
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:11,636
No next of kin.
Still living in France.

333
00:32:12,117 --> 00:32:12,916
France?

334
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:17,516
She was undocumented resident.
An illegal immigrant.

335
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,157
You have 10 minutes.

336
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:31,837
Jesus!

337
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:34,917
Latent injuries.

338
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,118
Electrocution, drowning,
heart attack on the metro.

339
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,998
Who are these people?
My coworkers.

340
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:52,918
Illegal immigrants.

341
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,760
If we'd have gone home would
this have happened to us?

342
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,200
Walter's not here.

343
00:33:23,321 --> 00:33:24,520
Hello, can I help you?

344
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:26,600
Have you seen these people?

345
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:31,601
You okay?

346
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:35,721
I'm fine.

347
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:37,481
Let's go, Amy.

348
00:33:40,762 --> 00:33:42,281
You okay?

349
00:33:42,442 --> 00:33:44,161
Let me take your bag.

350
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:48,121
Amy, come here, talk to me.

351
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:50,682
Get off me!

352
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,282
You can kill a man with your bare hands.

353
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:56,763
You can move through a crowded station
without the cops even knowing you're there.

354
00:33:56,764 --> 00:33:58,802
You can speak like, Russian!
Croatian.

355
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:00,643
No, you can look at a bunch of photos, and

356
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:02,604
instinctively know where
you'll find the bodies.

357
00:34:02,795 --> 00:34:04,755
What father can do those things?
Let me explain.

358
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:05,682
No, explain this:

359
00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:09,283
You've been working for a company
that's only been employing immigrants,

360
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:10,923
who are now dead!

361
00:34:11,994 --> 00:34:12,504
Amy...

362
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,643
Why did I even come here?
Amy!

363
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:18,883
Why did I even have to leave grandpa.

364
00:34:19,044 --> 00:34:22,203
You told me to trust you!
I don't even know who you are!

365
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:25,964
Walter!

366
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:37,884
Down!

367
00:34:56,606 --> 00:34:57,445
Come on!

368
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,451
Dad!

369
00:36:46,613 --> 00:36:48,012
I'll get you out of here.

370
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:53,452
Come on!

371
00:37:03,214 --> 00:37:05,533
Let me see.
Be careful!

372
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:07,773
Dad, you've got a...

373
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:11,774
It's just a flesh wound, you'll be okay.

374
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:20,774
Here.

375
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:25,654
Go to the window.
Go to the window!

376
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:33,254
Open! Police!

377
00:37:33,455 --> 00:37:35,134
Open the door!

378
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:55,455
Get in.

379
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:15,537
Here, take this.
Keep it pressed on your arm.

380
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:42,778
You'll be all right.

381
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,659
This is gonna sting a bit, okay.

382
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,219
Hold my hand.

383
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,459
Put your arm up here.

384
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,620
You wanna know how I found the bodies?
Is that it?

385
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:19,260
Floyd's locker was a safe drop.

386
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,860
That file was a target hit list.

387
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:25,341
And Floyd was a professional assassin.

388
00:39:25,942 --> 00:39:28,221
Following some sort of
government training protocol.

389
00:39:39,382 --> 00:39:41,141
Is that alright?
Not too tight?

390
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:47,862
What did mom tell you about me?

391
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:52,702
That you were in Overseas Political Affairs
for The State Department.

392
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,822
Your mother...

393
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:20,224
I was working for the CIA.

394
00:40:28,305 --> 00:40:30,664
The communiques on the
Pan-African Council, Anna.

395
00:40:31,665 --> 00:40:34,104
Great, exactly what I needed.

396
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:36,505
It's for the daily brief.

397
00:40:43,346 --> 00:40:46,145
Floyd Remi, former local operative,
killed on a roadside.

398
00:40:46,466 --> 00:40:47,905
Outside Brussels.

399
00:40:49,466 --> 00:40:51,985
Walter Smet, another former asset.

400
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:56,266
Killed in a hospital in Antwerp
only a couple of hours ago.

401
00:40:57,387 --> 00:40:59,866
Ben Logan, one of your operatives, Anna.

402
00:41:01,147 --> 00:41:03,546
We think he may have killed them both.

403
00:41:04,187 --> 00:41:07,026
Ben was decommissioned six months ago.
Decommissioned?

404
00:41:07,347 --> 00:41:10,067
Why?
He grown a conscience.

405
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,187
Stopped following orders.

406
00:41:12,628 --> 00:41:15,827
The Oversight Committee decided
to make an example of him.

407
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,228
I put his report on your
desk when it happened.

408
00:41:18,229 --> 00:41:20,067
Why wasn't he brought home?

409
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:22,387
He wanted to go home.

410
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:25,667
But the Committee punished him,
by making sure he'd never be able to.

411
00:41:26,348 --> 00:41:27,828
He can't ever return to the U.S.

412
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:30,028
Has he tried to contact you?

413
00:41:32,629 --> 00:41:34,549
I haven't spoken to Ben
since we cut him loose.

414
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:37,028
What's going on?

415
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:39,948
This is our black vault in Brussels.

416
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:43,188
We were using it as a repository
for sensitive documentation.

417
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:46,269
It was burgled two nights ago,
by somebody who could break

418
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,469
our most advanced security systems.

419
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,149
That canister contained
top-secret documents

420
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,670
we were collecting on behalf
of The Department Of Justice

421
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:55,591
in conjunction with the
Belgian secret service.

422
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,029
Collecting evidence for what?

423
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,469
It relates to a class action
for negligence in Belgium

424
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,830
against The Halgate Group.

425
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:05,950
One of their merchant ships
sank six months ago.

426
00:42:06,431 --> 00:42:09,110
The families of the crewmen
want compensation.

427
00:42:09,431 --> 00:42:11,391
Halgate is willing to
settle, but one family's

428
00:42:11,392 --> 00:42:13,350
holding out and putting together their case.

429
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:15,830
The investigators for the family's lawyers

430
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:18,870
discovered something bigger
than a class action,

431
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:20,351
something in the ship's manifest.

432
00:42:20,592 --> 00:42:22,551
Incriminating Halgate?

433
00:42:23,272 --> 00:42:27,031
On direct orders from the White House, this
is a top level classified investigation.

434
00:42:30,072 --> 00:42:32,071
What did you find?

435
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,071
A smoking gun.

436
00:42:35,072 --> 00:42:37,032
That The Halgate Group was
shipping illegal arms

437
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:40,952
to destabilize countries for
their own economic gain.

438
00:42:41,153 --> 00:42:44,352
Naturally, the White House thinks it
is our job to destabilize countries.

439
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:46,672
Someone stole your smoking gun.

440
00:42:46,873 --> 00:42:49,392
Someone breached into the CIA.

441
00:42:50,913 --> 00:42:52,752
Halgate is a criminal.

442
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:57,793
Without that evidence, the investigation
against The Halgate Group will collapse.

443
00:42:57,954 --> 00:42:59,353
Stakes are too high.

444
00:42:59,754 --> 00:43:02,873
The only thing we have to go on is
that Logan, a top security expert,

445
00:43:03,034 --> 00:43:05,433
was in Belgium at the time of the break-in.

446
00:43:05,674 --> 00:43:06,873
Can you find him?

447
00:43:08,634 --> 00:43:11,473
It's no secret you knew him intimately.

448
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:13,794
I'll get on it.

449
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:26,314
Derek?

450
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:28,594
You said this wouldn't happen.

451
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,875
What wouldn't happen?

452
00:43:32,116 --> 00:43:34,195
You said no one was gonna die.

453
00:43:34,956 --> 00:43:36,155
This was all wrong!

454
00:43:36,356 --> 00:43:39,435
And that means what?
It means they're all dead.

455
00:43:41,596 --> 00:43:44,395
The company, all the employees.

456
00:43:44,596 --> 00:43:47,635
And they're gonna kill me too.
You said this would end in pink slips.

457
00:43:47,956 --> 00:43:49,676
This wasn't pink slips!

458
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:53,076
Nothing was supposed to go
down without my approval!

459
00:43:53,277 --> 00:43:54,716
They cut you out of the equation.

460
00:43:54,997 --> 00:43:56,636
Who gave the order?

461
00:43:56,877 --> 00:43:58,116
Braymer.

462
00:44:03,237 --> 00:44:04,356
Where is Logan?

463
00:44:08,598 --> 00:44:10,237
Derek, speak to me!

464
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:13,138
Derek!

465
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:15,677
Did you secure the cargo?

466
00:44:17,998 --> 00:44:22,197
Yeah, I have it. But now, this
is gonna play out on my terms.

467
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,879
Tell the consulate in Brussels I'm
coming in and raise a local team.

468
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:32,838
Now!

469
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,118
Your mom and I were trying to protect you.

470
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,558
Yeah, from the truth.

471
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,839
Did grandpa know?

472
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,439
Yeah, he always knew.

473
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,879
What exactly did you do for the CIA?

474
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,279
I got people in and out of...

475
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,280
difficult situations.

476
00:45:01,601 --> 00:45:03,920
I'm sorry we lied to you.

477
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:16,641
Your mother took that photo.

478
00:45:16,802 --> 00:45:18,401
Yeah, she told me.

479
00:45:19,922 --> 00:45:22,001
She could see things I never could.

480
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:29,881
I miss her too.

481
00:45:33,162 --> 00:45:36,442
Why'd you quit your job?
To be a father.

482
00:45:38,643 --> 00:45:40,842
I'm not doing too good
of a job of it, am I?

483
00:45:41,723 --> 00:45:45,282
I wouldn't know.
Oh, really?

484
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:49,322
We can't go back home, can we?
No.

485
00:45:50,723 --> 00:45:52,483
We go back home...

486
00:45:53,324 --> 00:45:55,763
These people found us twice,
they'll find us again.

487
00:45:56,124 --> 00:45:57,323
Who are these people?

488
00:45:57,484 --> 00:46:00,563
I'm not sure.
I think I was being used.

489
00:46:01,164 --> 00:46:03,203
All I know, those products were real.

490
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:06,243
And if Halgate wasn't making them,
then somebody else was.

491
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:08,603
Somebody wanted them compromised.

492
00:46:10,525 --> 00:46:11,724
Look at this.

493
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:14,644
That's a patent number.

494
00:46:14,745 --> 00:46:18,025
It's etched into some of the products.
We have to find out what's that all about.

495
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:19,484
Then there's my place of work.

496
00:46:19,685 --> 00:46:21,484
Addresses have owners, clues.

497
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:25,204
All we gotta do is figure out
where we're to stay tonight.

498
00:46:27,846 --> 00:46:29,605
Can I have some change?

499
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:46,406
Nabil said he'd help.

500
00:46:46,447 --> 00:46:47,047
Yes?

501
00:46:48,727 --> 00:46:50,286
Come on.

502
00:47:02,928 --> 00:47:04,767
Karim, this is my dad.

503
00:47:05,008 --> 00:47:07,247
Dad, this is Nabil's brother, Karim.

504
00:47:07,848 --> 00:47:08,887
Hello, Karim.

505
00:47:09,088 --> 00:47:10,327
It's a pleasure.

506
00:47:10,808 --> 00:47:13,087
Nabil said you'd help.

507
00:47:14,848 --> 00:47:16,687
I said I'd think about it.

508
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:18,967
You found us a place in Brussels?

509
00:47:19,688 --> 00:47:23,408
I don't help criminals.
That's good, 'cause we're not criminals.

510
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:26,968
Yet you're fugitives.
Victims of circumstance.

511
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:29,568
2000 euros.

512
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:32,488
Cash.
Half now, for two nights.

513
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:35,208
Gimme the money.

514
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,929
Nabil said your sister keeps all the
money and you're up your ass in debt.

515
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,449
Nabil's got a big mouth.

516
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,489
I suggest you change too.

517
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:03,090
Come on, let's go.

518
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:12,570
My daughter is just a friend
or you want to tell me something?

519
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:15,051
No, it's...

520
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:19,571
Hey, no fair, what'd you say?
Go ask him.

521
00:48:25,132 --> 00:48:27,171
Abdul will make sure you get a place.

522
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:30,452
And it seems to me, you
probably need this more than I.

523
00:48:30,653 --> 00:48:32,372
We are not all mercenaries.

524
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:35,532
Who are they?

525
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:37,333
You're not the only one on the run.

526
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:41,092
Good luck.

527
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:45,216
It's okay, you can stay

528
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:48,576
for two days in kids' rooms.
Alright?

529
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,896
Thank you.

530
00:50:23,179 --> 00:50:24,978
When she was sick,

531
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:28,458
you're all she talked about.

532
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,859
I think...

533
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,140
I think she still loved you.

534
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:21,141
Sorry to get you guys up at this hour.

535
00:51:41,943 --> 00:51:43,982
Everything we found in his apartment.

536
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:51,564
Hello?

537
00:51:52,224 --> 00:51:53,863
What have you found?

538
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:58,583
He was an expatriate living
in Antwerp with his daughter.

539
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:03,424
Records show, he moved here two
months ago on a business visa.

540
00:52:04,185 --> 00:52:07,024
Don't worry.
I'll find him.

541
00:52:16,225 --> 00:52:18,065
My feeling is there's
really no need to press

542
00:52:18,066 --> 00:52:19,905
for an excavation of the boat.

543
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:22,065
Self-combustion is a
common risk when you ship

544
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:23,625
construction materials.

545
00:52:23,986 --> 00:52:27,425
I'm sure we can find a way to
compensate you for this tragic event.

546
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:30,185
This is not about money,
Mr. Braymer.

547
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,665
I want Mr. Halgate

548
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:36,105
to appear here personally
and look me in the eye.

549
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:40,546
And I want him to apologize
for my son's death.

550
00:52:47,027 --> 00:52:47,826
Where are you?

551
00:52:49,187 --> 00:52:50,666
Where do you think?

552
00:52:51,427 --> 00:52:53,946
You told me the CIA had
something you wanted.

553
00:52:54,107 --> 00:52:55,827
I arranged to get it.

554
00:52:55,988 --> 00:52:59,387
Why did you murder these people?
Let's meet.

555
00:52:59,588 --> 00:53:00,867
One hour.

556
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,267
You dismantled the covert operation

557
00:53:11,468 --> 00:53:12,988
I was running for you.

558
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:15,468
You used my agents to kill.

559
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:18,749
You've made Logan the subject of a manhunt!
What the hell got into you?

560
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:20,791
He was about to find out
the company was a fake.

561
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:23,708
It was an executive decision.

562
00:53:24,149 --> 00:53:26,548
Logan was looking into the patents.

563
00:53:26,749 --> 00:53:29,748
Asking questions about who
owned the security systems.

564
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:33,549
What possessed you to get him involved?
Because you wanted something done quick!

565
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,989
And he's the best there is.

566
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,189
Tell me you at least have the evidence.

567
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,390
You know what was in the container?

568
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,429
Do you have it?
We're working on it.

569
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:48,190
Kohler has the container but we can't find
him, he's not answering his phone, he's...

570
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:50,390
He's gone.

571
00:53:51,471 --> 00:53:52,950
You don't have Kohler.

572
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,990
You don't have the evidence.

573
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:57,351
If Logan finds out what
we got him involved in...

574
00:53:57,352 --> 00:53:58,350
He's just an engineer.

575
00:53:58,671 --> 00:54:02,790
CIA Black Ops, you idiot.
We don't make engineers.

576
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:06,631
Our employer wasn't sure your
personal feelings for Logan

577
00:54:06,912 --> 00:54:09,751
wouldn't cloud your judgment
in making the tough calls.

578
00:54:11,512 --> 00:54:13,951
If Halgate goes down, I go down.

579
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:17,152
No matter how much security you surround
yourself with if Logan finds out,

580
00:54:17,272 --> 00:54:19,551
he'll get to you.
I can fix this!

581
00:54:20,192 --> 00:54:22,991
Find Kohler, bring in the evidence.

582
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:25,272
We'll get you his last known location.

583
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:26,352
What about Ben?

584
00:54:26,553 --> 00:54:28,872
We've got that covered.
We brought in an expert.

585
00:55:31,756 --> 00:55:33,135
Give me the number.
Okay.

586
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:34,396
Hold on, hold on.

587
00:55:38,997 --> 00:55:40,876
Alright. Give me the patent number now.
Okay.

588
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:42,796
X-D-N

589
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:44,596
3-6-7.

590
00:55:47,957 --> 00:55:49,516
Mei Ling was right.

591
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:56,277
Halgate doesn't own the patent.
Belongs to Total Security in New York.

592
00:55:57,478 --> 00:56:00,717
Write that down: 785506.

593
00:56:02,528 --> 00:56:04,328
Central Intelligence Agency,
may I help you?

594
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:20,038
Central Intelligence Agency,
may I help you?

595
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:26,999
Alright, are you ready for this?

596
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,319
Your office address, the address for
Halgate Security System was short-leased,

597
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,719
six months ago to a company
called Markus Wolf Investments.

598
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,080
That company also has another
local registered address

599
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,359
by the same realtor,
right here in Brussels.

600
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,760
The realtor just told you this?
Yeah, I know, they're dying to lease it.

601
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:49,200
We gotta hurry, because it's Saturday
and the realtor gets busy.

602
00:56:49,561 --> 00:56:51,760
I put this at viewing in 30 minutes.

603
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:54,240
Who you think you are, Sherlock Holmes?

604
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:56,880
I'm gonna go get my bag.

605
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:28,362
What about the previous occupant,
you ever meet him?

606
00:57:28,523 --> 00:57:31,442
Mr. Wolf, he's running
an investment company.

607
00:57:41,364 --> 00:57:43,443
Would you mind giving us a minute?

608
00:57:43,604 --> 00:57:44,603
Sure.

609
00:57:45,164 --> 00:57:47,123
I'll be in the car.
Thank you.

610
00:58:08,205 --> 00:58:10,164
Got an eye on her?
Yeah.

611
00:58:12,326 --> 00:58:15,965
Who is Markus Wolf?
He's an East German cold-war spy master.

612
00:58:16,286 --> 00:58:17,925
Somebody's idea of a joke.

613
00:58:18,126 --> 00:58:22,445
Wait, so he's not even alive?
No, he's been dead 5 years or so.

614
00:58:22,806 --> 00:58:25,006
Looks like I was working for
some kind of proprietary.

615
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:26,565
What's a proprietary?

616
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,886
It's a shell company,
created to do one thing,

617
00:58:28,986 --> 00:58:32,086
when in reality, it's doing
something completely different.

618
00:58:32,287 --> 00:58:34,766
So wait, why would the CIA file
patents for a shell company?

619
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:38,526
Amy, quit with the questions
for a minute, okay?

620
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:46,526
Disconnection hasn't gone through yet.

621
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,889
Bingo!

622
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,609
I pulled up caller records on
Markus Wolf Investments.

623
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,449
Now, that office was closed yesterday,

624
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,729
but there was a call made from
there about an hour ago.

625
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:54,770
Ben.

626
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:57,490
We have to move.

627
01:00:12,532 --> 01:00:14,811
Markus Wolf, suite 619.

628
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:18,932
Keep your eyes open.
Through the mirrors.

629
01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:21,972
Remember...
Corners are safe.

630
01:00:22,573 --> 01:00:23,932
Don't be a smart ass.

631
01:00:24,293 --> 01:00:25,493
You're my eyes and ears, okay?

632
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:20,016
Markus Wolf is your alias, huh?

633
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:22,655
That's cute.
What's next, Mata Hari?

634
01:01:44,198 --> 01:01:45,777
You're making a big mistake!

635
01:01:47,698 --> 01:01:50,537
There was no product
development team, was there, Derek?

636
01:01:55,138 --> 01:01:57,937
There was no Halgate security systems!

637
01:01:58,498 --> 01:02:00,337
You got us hack into CIA!

638
01:02:00,498 --> 01:02:01,698
Come on.

639
01:02:09,379 --> 01:02:10,298
Why?

640
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:12,608
For what?

641
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,339
Who are you working for?

642
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,220
Get outta here while you still can, Ben.

643
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:39,260
Go where, you son of a bitch!

644
01:03:06,142 --> 01:03:07,781
You gotta start talking, pal.

645
01:03:09,422 --> 01:03:12,582
You put my daughter's life in danger.
I want answers!

646
01:03:26,863 --> 01:03:28,742
She said it was a simple operation.

647
01:03:29,103 --> 01:03:31,703
Who's she?
She told them to hire you.

648
01:03:37,184 --> 01:03:39,623
She said we never recover
the documents without you.

649
01:03:41,144 --> 01:03:42,104
Recover what documents?

650
01:03:54,005 --> 01:03:55,424
Recover what documents?
Dad!

651
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:57,424
In the canister on the couch.

652
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,344
Wait outside. Go on!

653
01:04:00,825 --> 01:04:02,544
Wait outside, go on!

654
01:04:04,905 --> 01:04:06,305
I got a family, too.

655
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:08,945
This was gonna be my pension.

656
01:04:12,506 --> 01:04:15,505
If I die, they'll look after my family.
Who will look after your family?

657
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:16,865
The Agency.

658
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:19,025
You were CIA?
Shoot me!

659
01:04:19,466 --> 01:04:20,865
Dad!
Shoot me!

660
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:34,946
Come here.

661
01:04:47,868 --> 01:04:49,467
Get the room searched.

662
01:04:52,148 --> 01:04:53,147
Ben!

663
01:05:02,669 --> 01:05:03,748
Go back!

664
01:05:11,629 --> 01:05:12,828
Go!
Over here!

665
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:18,870
Get up!
Come on, get over!

666
01:05:38,271 --> 01:05:39,710
Stand down!

667
01:05:40,911 --> 01:05:43,910
I said, stand down!
He's one of us, for Christ sakes!

668
01:05:50,511 --> 01:05:51,721
Ben?

669
01:05:54,712 --> 01:05:57,831
Whatever is going on, we can figure it out.

670
01:06:06,032 --> 01:06:07,711
We can protect you.

671
01:06:08,913 --> 01:06:10,232
Both of you.

672
01:06:21,313 --> 01:06:22,013
Ben?

673
01:06:25,013 --> 01:06:25,613
Ben?

674
01:06:28,474 --> 01:06:29,273
Back off!

675
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:31,593
Put 'em down!

676
01:06:31,914 --> 01:06:33,353
Stand back.

677
01:06:34,554 --> 01:06:36,193
Kick 'em away!

678
01:06:38,514 --> 01:06:41,233
What have you got me involved with, Anna?

679
01:06:43,194 --> 01:06:44,474
You've got this all wrong.

680
01:06:47,515 --> 01:06:49,394
You gotta trust me.
Dad, get in!

681
01:06:50,635 --> 01:06:52,034
Get back!

682
01:06:52,715 --> 01:06:54,114
They'll find you.

683
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:55,715
They'll kill you.
They'll kill her!

684
01:06:56,835 --> 01:06:58,954
I can help you go home.
Dad, get in the car!

685
01:06:59,155 --> 01:07:01,194
No, listen to me, please!
Why?

686
01:07:01,356 --> 01:07:03,995
You stood by six months ago and
watched the Committee burn me.

687
01:07:04,156 --> 01:07:07,955
Stood by? You were part if a kill squad!
You questioned your orders!

688
01:07:08,436 --> 01:07:10,475
I was the one who stopped
them from killing you.

689
01:07:10,676 --> 01:07:11,635
Dad, get in the car!

690
01:07:11,796 --> 01:07:13,635
Give me the bag, Ben.

691
01:07:14,236 --> 01:07:15,315
You're good, Anna.

692
01:07:15,636 --> 01:07:17,435
You're very good.

693
01:07:19,117 --> 01:07:19,717
Ben!

694
01:07:20,277 --> 01:07:21,226
Go!

695
01:07:34,637 --> 01:07:36,516
Who is she?
Who taught you to drive?

696
01:07:36,718 --> 01:07:37,837
No, who is she?

697
01:07:37,998 --> 01:07:39,957
Just someone I used to work with.

698
01:07:45,718 --> 01:07:46,717
CIA.

699
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:58,038
What are you doing?
Don't lie to me, I'm not an idiot, I saw you.

700
01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:03,358
Slow down, Amy.

701
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:08,438
What's a kill squad?
What's a kill squad?

702
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:13,079
Slow down, Amy!

703
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,039
Amy, brakes!

704
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:36,680
I kill people.

705
01:08:38,441 --> 01:08:40,680
That's what a kill squad is all about,
killing people.

706
01:08:40,841 --> 01:08:42,280
The dirty work.

707
01:08:43,361 --> 01:08:45,280
The things that have to be done.

708
01:08:46,401 --> 01:08:48,521
The things nobody wants to do.

709
01:08:50,442 --> 01:08:52,081
I did these things.

710
01:08:56,122 --> 01:08:58,441
I never wanted my daughter to find out.

711
01:09:01,362 --> 01:09:03,081
You didn't come back for me.

712
01:09:05,883 --> 01:09:06,882
I did!

713
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:11,442
You've came to me, because
you had nowhere else to go.

714
01:09:13,763 --> 01:09:15,562
I had friends.

715
01:09:16,363 --> 01:09:18,042
I had a life, dad!

716
01:09:23,444 --> 01:09:24,803
You brought me

717
01:09:25,124 --> 01:09:26,923
to a foreign country,

718
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:31,723
lied, to get me here.

719
01:09:32,844 --> 01:09:34,643
You lied to me about everything.

720
01:09:37,484 --> 01:09:40,004
Why couldn't you just leave me alone?

721
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:43,725
Amy!

722
01:09:44,725 --> 01:09:45,325
Amy!

723
01:09:49,925 --> 01:09:50,525
Amy!

724
01:09:53,825 --> 01:09:54,425
Amy!

725
01:09:58,226 --> 01:09:58,826
Amy!

726
01:10:32,407 --> 01:10:34,007
I need a telephone.

727
01:10:35,028 --> 01:10:35,828
A telephone.

728
01:10:46,628 --> 01:10:47,328
Hello?

729
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:49,207
Grandpa?

730
01:10:49,488 --> 01:10:52,528
Amy, oh my God, are you okay?

731
01:10:54,729 --> 01:10:57,208
I've been trying to call you.
Where are you?

732
01:11:01,369 --> 01:11:03,448
Grandpa, I wanna come home.

733
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:07,888
You sound terrible.
Is everything alright?

734
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:13,049
Amy?
Hello?

735
01:12:17,853 --> 01:12:19,273
Hey, you!
I'm talking to you!

736
01:12:19,374 --> 01:12:21,734
They killed my brother in front
of my five year old niece!

737
01:12:21,814 --> 01:12:24,384
They were looking for you!
I want their names!

738
01:12:24,434 --> 01:12:26,314
I want to know who they are!
I want them dead!

739
01:12:28,454 --> 01:12:29,893
So do I.

740
01:12:31,374 --> 01:12:32,933
They took Amy.

741
01:12:35,134 --> 01:12:36,454
Get in the car!

742
01:13:22,977 --> 01:13:25,536
Altheon X-135 solid state.

743
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:31,017
"Xyston TA-20" Polemarch.

744
01:13:31,178 --> 01:13:32,497
What's a "Polemarch"?

745
01:13:33,738 --> 01:13:35,057
Polemarch.

746
01:13:36,218 --> 01:13:37,457
It's a radar tracking system.

747
01:13:44,978 --> 01:13:47,898
It's parts inside IAT drone defense system.

748
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:51,978
That cargo ship was carrying U.S.
made weapons.

749
01:13:52,859 --> 01:13:54,658
For Mozambique.

750
01:14:02,579 --> 01:14:04,619
...necessary conditions to secure business...

751
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,739
Lithium.

752
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,739
What's a Lithium?
Next generation technology.

753
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,739
Nuclear power.

754
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:18,259
Mobile telecommunications,
electric cars, that kind of thing.

755
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,819
Halgate Group.

756
01:14:22,741 --> 01:14:23,860
Anna.

757
01:14:37,021 --> 01:14:38,100
What about Amy?

758
01:14:39,581 --> 01:14:41,661
I thought we were trying to find her.

759
01:14:42,462 --> 01:14:44,901
"James Halgate III."

760
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:49,541
We just did.

761
01:14:53,442 --> 01:14:54,192
Hello?

762
01:14:54,262 --> 01:14:55,461
You know what I have?

763
01:14:58,863 --> 01:14:59,702
I'm listening.

764
01:14:59,983 --> 01:15:03,382
Gare du Nord, Platform 4, one hour.

765
01:15:45,145 --> 01:15:45,745
Hello?

766
01:15:46,225 --> 01:15:48,504
There's a train, Platform 5.

767
01:15:50,105 --> 01:15:51,345
Get on it.

768
01:15:51,786 --> 01:15:53,425
Front carriage.

769
01:15:58,346 --> 01:15:59,985
Go!
Over there!

770
01:16:05,746 --> 01:16:07,625
Get off the train, now.

771
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,906
There's a train pulling into Platform 8.

772
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:26,187
Hurry.

773
01:16:28,028 --> 01:16:29,627
Rear compartment.

774
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,109
That's the Anna I know.

775
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:21,470
I see you've been selling your
services to The Halgate Group.

776
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:27,310
How long has Halgate been
reaching into the CIA?

777
01:17:28,071 --> 01:17:30,430
How long have you been
in bed with him, Anna?

778
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:32,390
All the way back to Somalia?

779
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:33,051
No.

780
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:36,852
No.

781
01:17:43,632 --> 01:17:47,071
I'll never forget the first
day you showed up in Somalia.

782
01:17:48,152 --> 01:17:50,271
Ready to set the world on fire.

783
01:17:52,432 --> 01:17:54,232
We stood for something.

784
01:17:56,033 --> 01:17:58,232
We believed we could change the world.

785
01:17:59,993 --> 01:18:01,952
What do you believe in now, Anna?

786
01:18:02,153 --> 01:18:04,272
I believe you should have listened to me.

787
01:18:04,673 --> 01:18:06,032
I told you,

788
01:18:06,273 --> 01:18:09,952
these people will sop at nothing
to get what they want.

789
01:18:10,273 --> 01:18:12,993
How did you become everything
we fought against?

790
01:18:15,954 --> 01:18:17,233
It's just business, Ben.

791
01:18:17,994 --> 01:18:20,073
It's my daughter's life!

792
01:18:21,394 --> 01:18:23,153
Just give them what they want.

793
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,673
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And then we'll be safe, huh?

794
01:18:28,054 --> 01:18:28,654
Yeah.

795
01:18:29,275 --> 01:18:30,634
I can't.

796
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:39,394
I want you to go your boss, your
real boss, with a message.

797
01:18:40,835 --> 01:18:42,434
I know who he is.

798
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:45,554
I know where he's gonna be.

799
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:48,155
If he has her, I want her.

800
01:18:49,116 --> 01:18:50,795
If he's harmed her,

801
01:18:51,876 --> 01:18:53,435
he's dead.

802
01:19:25,878 --> 01:19:27,277
It was the only one I could find.

803
01:19:27,478 --> 01:19:28,537
Would it do?

804
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:31,208
Oh, yeah.

805
01:19:31,718 --> 01:19:33,557
Thank you, Nabil.
That's perfect.

806
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,319
James Halgate III has
arrived in the Belgium

807
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,120
courthouse today in an effort
to settle the longstanding

808
01:20:17,321 --> 01:20:20,280
Class action suit against his company.
The suit was put forth

809
01:20:20,481 --> 01:20:22,960
by the bereaved families of
those who lost loved ones,

810
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:26,080
when the ship owned by
The Halgate Group, The Serenity,

811
01:20:26,281 --> 01:20:27,920
sank off the coast of Belgium.

812
01:20:28,081 --> 01:20:31,440
150 lives were lost in this tragedy.

813
01:20:35,922 --> 01:20:37,041
Ms Pieters,

814
01:20:37,322 --> 01:20:40,081
I am deeply sorry for your loss.

815
01:20:40,442 --> 01:20:43,201
I hope you will accept our offer of support

816
01:20:43,402 --> 01:20:45,561
In your hour of need.

817
01:20:49,322 --> 01:20:51,442
Is there a settlement I don't know about?

818
01:21:11,644 --> 01:21:12,963
No, I'm sorry, I don't comment.

819
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:24,043
I'm sorry, no comment.
Thank you very much.

820
01:21:35,605 --> 01:21:36,844
I'll catch you later.

821
01:21:38,485 --> 01:21:39,444
For you!

822
01:21:40,685 --> 01:21:42,485
I'll talk to you later.
Thank you very much.

823
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:44,605
Your boss comes alone.

824
01:21:45,566 --> 01:21:48,005
When I know she's safe,
you'll get your evidence.

825
01:21:49,526 --> 01:21:50,325
I'm listening.

826
01:21:50,726 --> 01:21:54,045
Keep this phone on you.
I'll text you a time and a place.

827
01:22:12,687 --> 01:22:13,766
Hold it!

828
01:22:36,689 --> 01:22:38,449
I told you to wait!
I need to speak to him.

829
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:41,130
He's dealing with the regional president.
I don't give a shit.

830
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:43,208
He doesn't meet the help.

831
01:22:49,689 --> 01:22:50,488
Anna!

832
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:54,889
Mr. Halgate?

833
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:58,769
- I didn't realize we had a one o'clock.
- She was just leaving.

834
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,929
He's going to kill you.

835
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:04,489
You must be the mercurial Anna Brandt.

836
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:06,009
I'm honored!
You took the girl.

837
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:07,489
Where is she?

838
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:11,650
So much trouble because
of one little accident!

839
01:23:11,851 --> 01:23:14,490
Because one little ship sinks.

840
01:23:16,411 --> 01:23:20,090
I'm flying back to Chicago
in exactly four hours.

841
01:23:21,171 --> 01:23:22,810
I need this fixed before I leave.

842
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:24,930
Let me make the exchange.
I know Ben.

843
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:28,490
You seem very concerned
about his welfare, Anna.

844
01:23:28,772 --> 01:23:31,811
I've compromised my entire career for you.

845
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:33,891
For money that's in an
account I can't touch

846
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:35,451
if this blows up.

847
01:23:35,612 --> 01:23:39,611
I'll do whatever needs to be done
to neutralize the situation.

848
01:23:40,492 --> 01:23:42,731
You and I are cut from
the same cloth, Anna.

849
01:23:43,372 --> 01:23:45,811
We know what we want and how to get it.

850
01:23:46,453 --> 01:23:49,772
We're capable of making the
tough calls when required.

851
01:23:50,133 --> 01:23:51,773
Jim, you said we could do this ourselves.

852
01:23:55,373 --> 01:23:56,652
It's Logan.

853
01:23:56,933 --> 01:23:59,612
The monument by the Palace of Justice.

854
01:23:59,813 --> 01:24:00,652
At three.

855
01:24:01,573 --> 01:24:03,572
I'll get the car.
There's no need.

856
01:24:04,134 --> 01:24:06,973
The only reason I came to this backwater,

857
01:24:07,134 --> 01:24:11,093
was to make sure I'm on the
plane home with my evidence.

858
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:13,853
Anna will get it for me.

859
01:26:20,421 --> 01:26:21,540
Run, Amy!

860
01:26:21,941 --> 01:26:23,220
Run!

861
01:26:45,543 --> 01:26:47,502
Shall I get the car now?

862
01:27:40,706 --> 01:27:42,345
I thought I told you to come alone.

863
01:27:42,506 --> 01:27:45,745
Mr. Braymer is here to serve
our mutual interests.

864
01:27:45,946 --> 01:27:48,106
Maybe he can tell me how much
it cost to buy the CIA?

865
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:50,425
Are we talking gross or net?

866
01:27:51,706 --> 01:27:52,705
Where is she?

867
01:27:52,866 --> 01:27:56,266
You give us what we want,
you'll get what you want.

868
01:27:57,627 --> 01:27:59,946
You fan the flames of a civil war.

869
01:28:00,347 --> 01:28:03,106
Selling weapons to tribal factions.

870
01:28:03,267 --> 01:28:07,186
For what? Access to lithium mines?
Protecting our interests.

871
01:28:07,347 --> 01:28:10,506
What these people did in their spare time,
was their own business.

872
01:28:10,707 --> 01:28:13,627
Yeah, except The Justice Department
was gonna figure you out.

873
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,828
So you hired a bunch of
immigrants to do the work.

874
01:28:15,829 --> 01:28:17,238
Then when they step out of line...

875
01:28:17,308 --> 01:28:19,467
Mr. Logan!
People have died!

876
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:21,707
So you could cover your tracks.

877
01:28:23,308 --> 01:28:24,507
Trust,

878
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:25,867
Mr. Logan,

879
01:28:26,628 --> 01:28:28,788
Is a precious resource.

880
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:55,069
Give me the documents, Ben.

881
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:59,709
Don't lose sight of reality, like Anna did.

882
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:03,990
Where is Anna?
Let's just say she wasn't a team player.

883
01:29:04,351 --> 01:29:06,851
Don't let your noble moral
compass get in the way, Ben.

884
01:29:06,852 --> 01:29:09,350
Where has it gotten you?

885
01:29:10,671 --> 01:29:11,910
You have nothing.

886
01:29:12,631 --> 01:29:13,670
No job.

887
01:29:14,191 --> 01:29:15,470
No money.

888
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:18,350
No country.

889
01:29:19,111 --> 01:29:20,870
Give me my daughter.
No.

890
01:29:22,672 --> 01:29:24,471
It has to be you,

891
01:29:24,672 --> 01:29:26,231
for her.

892
01:29:27,392 --> 01:29:30,271
We had a deal.
And now we're negotiating terms.

893
01:29:30,432 --> 01:29:32,751
Oh, I'm sure you can
understand our position.

894
01:30:14,955 --> 01:30:17,394
You okay?
Did they hurt you?

895
01:30:20,355 --> 01:30:21,674
Look at you.

896
01:30:30,515 --> 01:30:32,955
Take this.
What's going on?

897
01:30:33,476 --> 01:30:34,595
You're gonna be just fine.

898
01:30:34,956 --> 01:30:37,835
I want you to leave and
get as far away as you can.

899
01:30:38,696 --> 01:30:39,296
No.

900
01:30:40,836 --> 01:30:41,875
I have to stay here.

901
01:30:44,716 --> 01:30:46,995
No, you can't do that, you...
I have no choice.

902
01:30:47,996 --> 01:30:49,756
This is who I am.
No, it's not!

903
01:30:49,917 --> 01:30:51,956
This is how I make a difference.

904
01:31:00,957 --> 01:31:01,876
Go.

905
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:29,078
Don't have any second thoughts.

906
01:31:29,719 --> 01:31:31,998
She'll never be free if you do.

907
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:35,798
I believe you've forgotten something.

908
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,359
You don't look like CIA.

909
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,079
What are you, British?
MI6?

910
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,039
KGB?

911
01:32:05,961 --> 01:32:07,360
Tell your boss he forgot a piece.

912
01:32:07,721 --> 01:32:09,640
You can't seriously let the girl go.

913
01:32:10,321 --> 01:32:13,840
A week. Send someone to take
care of the grandfather too.

914
01:33:02,124 --> 01:33:03,803
Call me when you get there, okay?

915
01:33:08,164 --> 01:33:09,363
Go.

916
01:33:37,006 --> 01:33:39,085
Hello!
Thank you.

917
01:33:53,447 --> 01:33:56,446
Last call for FWA flight 714 to New York.

918
01:33:56,927 --> 01:33:59,966
All remaining passengers, please board now.

919
01:34:12,248 --> 01:34:19,247
Stand by, passenger Markus Wolf,
please, come to the counter.
