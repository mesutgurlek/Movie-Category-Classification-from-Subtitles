<i>You are about to witness
the strength of street knowledge.</i>

2
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,633
<i>Yo, this is Queen Latifah</i>

3
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:21,061
<i>Bringing a song to you
About a place you might live</i>

4
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:26,437
<i>In case you don't understand
It's called New Jack City</i>

5
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:29,675
<i>In case you still don't understand</i>

6
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:32,641
<i>I brought along Levert and Troop
To kick the ballistics</i>

<i>Unemployment is up,
says the Department of Labor...</i>

8
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:49,331
<i>... with nearly 200,000 more claims
for unemployment last month.</i>

9
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:54,160
<i>Americans whose income is below the
poverty line has risen to 2 million...</i>

10
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:57,098
<i>... compared to 1.6 million in 1979.</i>

11
00:00:57,407 --> 00:00:59,637
<i>Economists say that the
economic inequality...</i>

12
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:02,936
<i>... is at its worst level since
the days of the Great Depression.</i>

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,676
<i>Over the last 3 years, the percentage of
after-tax income for the rich rose 3%...</i>

14
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:11,986
<i>... while after-tax income
for the poor fell.2%.</i>

15
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:14,086
<i>Homelessness is at an all-time high.</i>

16
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,851
<i>A drive-by shooting in Harlem resulted
in the death of a 7-year-old boy.</i>

17
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:20,526
<i>Police say the shooting
was drug-related.</i>

18
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:23,255
<i>Said a police source,
"The kid just got in the way."</i>

19
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:28,129
<i>The bodies of 3 young black men
were discovered in Marcus Garvey Park.</i>

20
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,669
<i>Police believe they were victims
of a drug deal gone bad.</i>

21
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:35,741
<i>The identity of the victims
has been withheld.</i>

22
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:40,641
<i>Firemen were summoned to extract a man
from a ventilator duct of a building.</i>

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,887
<i>The man became trapped when he entered
the duct in order to rob the premises.</i>

24
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:50,989
<i>The deficit now stands

rode past Mr. Armeteo...</i>

27
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,765
<i>... and sprayed the group with gunfire.</i>

28
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:05,632
<i>The shooting was the result
of an ongoing turf war.</i>

29
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:43,403
Biff...

30
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,872
...look at you now.

31
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,443
Nino, please!

32
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:48,047
Don't start bitching up.

33
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,650
You don't have my product or my money.

34
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:54,720
You got to give me another chance!
Please!

35
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,323
Brothers don't wait to get paid.

36
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:59,094
Money talks.
Bullshit runs the marathon.

37
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:02,456
So, see you,
and I wouldn't want to be you.

38
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,709
<i>The number of addicted
infants born in Manhattan...</i>

Get out of my shit.

47
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:53,815
Thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory forever and ever. Amen.

48
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:58,278
I like to pray before I start
scrambling. Keeps people honest.

49
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,488
Say that shit, say that shit.

50
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:02,987
Do this now. What's your price?

51
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,989
Yo, man. For you, Bob Marley, 17.

52
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:10,130
For a key? You must be
doing the dope. Bring this down.

53
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:11,833
You got to get realistic.

54
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:13,659
I'm talking about a lower price.

55
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:14,869
Down.

56
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:20,641
This ain't Delancy Street, and you can't
Jew me down. That's my price.

57
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:25,313
Check this out, homeboy.
God's on your side, right?

58
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:29,176
Why don't we do this reasonable?
14K, bam.

59
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:33,050
You want to do this correct or not? 17.

60
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,722
Let me see the money.

61
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,717
Come on. Let's do this, man.

62
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,732
What you know about that?

63
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,335
Everybody out! Get down!

64
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,335
Everybody down! Police!

65
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:36,512
You think you slick, you little punk,
blasphemous dope-fiend bitch!

66
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:39,178
Spit in my face, I'm going to kill you!

67
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:42,851
- You fucking that kid up.
- He's kicking his monkey ass.

68
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:45,311
Ease back, goddamnit! I'm a cop!

69
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:50,750
Shut the fuck up!

70
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:53,461
It's over. You have the right
to remain silent.

71
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:58,633
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

72
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:14,376
I'm going to get paid.

73
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:19,419
If I make this, you're going to have
to come out your pockets.

74
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:37,134
- Ain't made that shot in years.
- Pay your taxes.

75
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,772
I'm like the IRS.

76
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:43,207
That's it! I love it.

77
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:52,216
What's up? Where you going?

78
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,456
<i>It's the sign of the times</i>

79
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:57,759
<i>I got to get mine
All I live is a life of crime</i>

80
00:07:57,994 --> 00:08:01,486
<i>They got my back against the wall
And my dick is in the dust</i>

81
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:03,197
Remember when we was kids...

82
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,393
...we played for Reverend Oates?
MO AB Bitty Squad?

83
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,064
I was 11, you was 13.
We was the baddest backcourt...

84
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:11,897
...in Each-One-Teach-One.

85
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,537
We wasn't making no money then.

86
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:19,247
And now that we are, you're here
living your Michael Jordan fantasy.

87
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:21,005
Business must be good.

88
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:22,945
It will be, brother.

89
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,816
Peep this out.

90
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:30,057
Freebase. So what?

91
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,818
Yo, man, you know the rules.

92
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:36,761
Us brothers don't be getting high.

93
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,292
Shut the fuck up and drive the car,
you non-talking bastard.

94
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,866
You been making money
outside the family?

95
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,074
I just been doing a little
experimentation-type thing.

96
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,173
A little experimentation-type thing.
Like what?

97
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:54,245
At the clubs, some of the guys step away
from the blackjack table or the bar...

98
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,815
...to buy $50 or $ 100 worth of sniff.

99
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:59,647
I set them up in the back room
with a hit of base...

100
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:03,949
...and 15 minutes after leaving the club,
they'd be back with 2 and 3 people.

101
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,421
So what?

102
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:11,030
They ain't come back for the cocaine.
They came back for the base.

103
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:16,266
You sound like
this shit'll change the world.

104
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:20,601
I don't know about all that
change-the-world shit, but I do know...

105
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,539
...they be going crazy over this.
And the bitches...

106
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:29,546
Oh, Lord! Them bitches,
they do anything for this, man!

107
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:33,949
I had my jimmy waxed every day
last week. You understand?

108
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:35,690
Several times a day.

109
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,017
Get the fuck out of here!

110
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:43,563
I know damn well ain't nobody
sucked your shriveled-up dick.

111
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,231
You trying to dis me?

112
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:48,628
I'm just telling the truth.
That's all I'm doing.

113
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:52,570
Several times a day, my ass.

114
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:57,535
All right, let me think about this
a little bit.

115
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:01,716
You think this base...

116
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,541
...is the high-powered shit?

117
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:08,255
We going to come off like the Mob.
You understand what I'm saying?

118
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:22,064
Welcome right here to the spotlite,
where we make the beat right...

119
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,772
...and we can't fight.
So leave your drugs and go home.

120
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:27,732
D.J. Clark Kent.

121
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,641
Rocking from turntable number 1
to turntable number 2.

122
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,384
Just like he want to do.

123
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:38,176
You going to frisk me too?

124
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:47,493
Yo, my boy, Nino in the house.
Yo, Nino. What's up?

125
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,191
You want a flower?

126
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,865
I think you'll like him.
Here he is.

127
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:27,165
What's up, crew?

128
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,305
Nino, your girl looks good.

129
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,242
You must like slumming, Kareem.

130
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:39,714
Why would a high-class guy like you
leave a good computer job at the bank...

131
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,816
...come all the way uptown
by gypsy cab...

132
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,043
...to work among a den of thieves?

133
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:46,253
I'm no dummy.

134
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,646
It's basic common sense and arithmetic.

135
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:52,052
The difference between
them paying me $800 a week...

136
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:54,626
...and you paying me $8,000 a week.

137
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:56,762
I think my cousin also likes the fact...

138
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,832
...that you're in the tradition
of Joe Kennedy.

139
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,127
Who?

140
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:07,342
Good. Because you got to rob
to get rich in the Reagan era.

141
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,708
They running a strange program.

142
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:14,449
More poor and disenfranchised folks
than this place has ever seen.

143
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,014
They try to act like it don't exist.

144
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:18,743
Meanwhile, the rich get richer...

145
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,454
And the poor don't get a thing.

146
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:24,625
Times like these, people want
to get high. Real high and real fast.

147
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:26,360
And this is going to do it.

148
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,292
And make us rich.

149
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:35,834
I mean, what,
people going crazy over this?

150
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:39,002
It look like cracked-off pieces of soap.

151
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:43,470
The Colombians and Dominicans
have shown us the way.

152
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,679
The shit is large.

153
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,939
But we'll do it differently.

154
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:50,208
No more selling on street corners.

155
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:53,488
Change the product,
you change the marketing strategy.

156
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:55,314
I've seen the future.

157
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:58,819
And its name is the Carter.

158
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,595
Hold up. The Carter Apartments,
that joint is big.

159
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:06,527
We're talking about
combinating and consolidating.

160
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:09,127
You're taking over The Carter?

161
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:13,842
We taking over The Carter. We going to
bum-rush the whole damn thing.

162
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:18,680
Now just imagine,
if the tenants cooperate, it's lovely.

163
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:21,074
They become loyal customers.

164
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:26,285
If they don't, fuck it. It's like
in Beirut, they become live-in hostages.

165
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,047
We going to set up a lab here
to make the product.

166
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:35,125
You hook up the computer, watch out for
the workers, the money and the product.

167
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,728
The Duh Duh Man, Keisha,
we need security...

168
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,400
...to ward off the rival crews,
screen customers.

169
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:42,466
We also need lookouts...

170
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:45,238
...here, here and here.

171
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,098
Alert us of 5-0.

172
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,743
One place to make the product,
one place to collect our money.

173
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:55,775
We will own this fucking city.

174
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:59,781
You's a genius, man. A pure, un...

175
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:06,223
Unadulterated. Would you please shut
the fuck up before you have a seizure?

176
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:09,721
Hey, man, suck my dick.

177
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,600
It's a brilliant plan.

178
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,894
But one thing does concern me, though.

179
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:19,297
That curry-goat-eating, skinny-ass
Fat Smitty.

180
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:23,305
He controls the Carter.
Time to sing that fat bitch a lullaby.

181
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,113
Rock-a-bye baby.

182
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:26,939
He'll be hanging with Elvis.

183
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:30,317
Damn.

184
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,912
Crack.

185
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:46,160
Hey, dreadlocks. What did Bombock
have to say? That bitch!

186
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:49,260
Let me speak with you.

187
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,399
Rastaman, I'm here to tell you
Nino Brown says...

188
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:57,043
...your services are no longer
needed in the community.

189
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:04,981
That's how you kill somebody. You get
right up on the motherfucker and blam!

190
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:09,691
Blow his brains all over the sidewalk
in broad daylight.

191
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,390
Rock-a-bye baby.

192
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:15,630
Brother, I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

193
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:20,294
Now look, you are going to give up
those apartments, huh?

194
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:23,934
And you are going to turn over
control of the Carter.

195
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,371
Because if you don't...

196
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:29,601
...this shotgun blows your big,
fat head off...

197
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:32,813
...before you can get
your clothes back on.

198
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,241
Is that clear?

199
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,214

If you just say "no,"
what will you say "yes" to?

222
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,730
We say "yes" to education.

223
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:09,261
We say "yes" to dedication.
We climb up...

224
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:13,872
...to a higher station
of new spiritual motivation...

225
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:17,440
...to make a positive impact
on our nation.

226
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,451
<i>Sergeant, I'm talking to you.</i>

227
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:33,661
I want to know how drug pushers can take
over an entire apartment building...

228
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:35,156
...right under your nose.

229
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:39,567
If you lived in The Carter Apartments,
there'd be cops all over the place.

230
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:42,866
Hey, don't walk away. Listen to me!

231
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:47,336
I fought for this country. We pay taxes
and we're prisoners in our home.

232
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:52,346
I told the Commissioner
you were running late.

233
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:56,073
- You got those files?
- Right here.

234
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,016
Let's hope he buys it.

235
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:08,990
Peretti and Appleton. No way, Stone.

236
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:10,231
Who else you got?

237
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:12,433
- They're the ones I need.
- You kidding me?

238
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:17,435
Nick Peretti almost killed his partner
in a chase, Appleton's on suspension.

239
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:18,662
Probation.

240
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:20,431
Semantics, Stone.

241
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,709
These 2 are trouble.

242
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:28,942
You and I know the system
wasn't ready for this epidemic.

243
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:31,752
Crack came on the scene
and spread like wildfire.

244
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,716
But now I got the mayor
and the governor on my back...

245
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:37,719
...and I need some results. Fast.

246
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:39,891
You get me Nino Brown.

247
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:43,620
Forget Peretti and Appleton.
The risk is too high.

248
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,598
With all due respect, sir...

249
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,460
...you still don't get it.

250
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:53,100
You're not giving me what I need
to win this war.

251
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,240
I need cops that know these streets.

252
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:58,071
I need new jack cops
to take down a new jack gangster.

253
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,574
What you call a risk...

254
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,408
...I think is our only shot.

255
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:14,226
You got your men.

256
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,361
But I don't want any waves.

257
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,869
Not a goddamn ripple.

258
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:54,594
<i>Who the hell is this
psychedelic blotter-acid fool?</i>

259
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,894
Be cool.

260
00:20:56,204 --> 00:21:01,141
This is Detective Nick Peretti, a crazy
motorcycle-freak, reject cop, like you.

261
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:03,572
A wild man no one else wanted.

262
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,904
He means I'm expendable.

263
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:09,980
Whatever, man. What did you
come here for? To watch me exercise?

264
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:13,119
I came here to lay a name on you.
Nino Brown?

265
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:14,946
His sidekick, "Gee Money" Wells?

266
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:16,918
Call themselves
the Cash Money Brothers.

267
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:19,125
Used to stickup twobit jewelry stores.

268
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:24,231
Yeah, thrill-seekers, wanna-be gangsters.
I hate them. So what's up?

269
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:27,059
What's up is this.
We need some evidence.

270
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:29,700
Evidence of murder, drug trafficking...

271
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:32,771
...racketeering, tax evasion. Anything.

272
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:36,108
We've never been able
to make anything stick on Brown.

273
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:39,079
No shit. 1/3 of the department's
on Nino's payroll.

274
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:42,317
The other 2/3 don't care
unless it affects their community.

275
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:43,676
What you saying?

276
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:47,346
Listen.
I've been authorized to set up...

277
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:50,352
...an independent drug-fighting unit
and I'm picking you.

278
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,616
- Why me?
- What do you mean, why you?

279
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:57,524
You're from the neighborhood. I can
trust you. And I know you give a shit.

280
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,334
So what's the catch?

281
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,168
There's no catch, man.
Why you got to say that?

282
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,236
Because I know your ass, Stone.

283
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:08,576
Peretti goes with you.

284
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,003
This big biscuit-head looking...

285
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,541
Listen! It's not going to be another
one of your wild-ass solo acts.

286
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:19,218
Peretti is the only cop I could find
crazy enough to team up with you.

287
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:21,721
This is my shot.

288
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:24,548
And you fuck up, it's all on me.

289
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:31,557
I want to thank you because you know
I want to get back in this war.

290
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,100
But this guy, man...

291
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:37,163
You in or out?

292
00:22:38,473 --> 00:22:40,065
I'm in, all right?

293
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:50,240
What do you mean,
Frazier won't give up the apartments?

294
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:55,386
I'm not asking him, I'm telling him!
I'll handle that fat bastard myself!

295
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:03,089
- We're honored.
- No, I'm honored. Really.

296
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,803
We understand you have
a new Peruvian connection.

297
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:14,740
So what of it?

298
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,204
We know you've started to centralize
operations at the Carter.

299
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,315
And you didn't notify Don Armeteo,
who takes such things as an insult.

300
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:27,251
Your point?

301
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:32,392
My point is you fucking guys are cutting
us out of our agreed upon 10%.

302
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:35,920
It's time we renegotiate.

303
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:40,629
I'll tell you what, message boy.

304
00:23:41,636 --> 00:23:43,934
You go back and tell Don Armeteo:

305
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:47,004
No renegotiating. Fuck that.

306
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:51,735
The Cash Money Brothers
are a self-contained unit now.

307
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:54,445
But you come see me next week.

308
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:58,744
And I'll hook you up with some of them
collard green linguinis and shit.

309
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,521
Chicken Alfredo. Chitlins Alfredo.

310
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,160
Maybe get a better suit!

311
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:08,885
Fuck you.

312
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:14,429
Nino, I don't know.

313
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:17,064
Frankie's an all-right guy.

314
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:20,137
<i>Fuck them scungili - eating motherfuckers.</i>

315
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:24,936
This is our thing. They don't want
to roll with it, we'll roll over them.

316
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:45,865
<i>This moolanyan must have an MX missile
instead of a cock, he gets so high.</i>

317
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,873
Our snitch was right.

318
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:56,143
Nino and his Cash Money monkeys...

319
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:59,814
...are dealing with those spicaroos
up on Broadway and 171 st.

320
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:02,049
They don't even deny it.

321
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,850
Nor does he accept
our partnership no more.

322
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,414
Now, Gee Money, he was cool.

323
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,349
<i>It was that testa dura, Nino.</i>

324
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,426
You know what I say. You lay down with
Peruvian dogs, you get Spanish fleas.

325
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:22,860
Soon Nino will itch.

326
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:26,440
We'll be there
to scratch the hell out of him.

327
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,714
1700 hours.

328
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,517
Suspects hand out consumables
and the natives are restless.

329
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,880
Yo, shut the fuck up, man.

330
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:43,847
Ten years as a low-life, murderous bum.

331
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:48,562
Nino's trying to purchase a conscience.
I ain't buying this Robin Hood bullshit.

332
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:52,226
Oh shit, that's the kid I shot!

333
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:57,297
Why don't you lose weight? You look
like a boiled yam wearing a belt!

334
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,551
What's up, baby? Glad to see
somebody cares about the needy.

335
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:13,413
Why don't you give me a turkey?

336
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:19,019
Look at your funky black ass.
First you want to be a stick-up kid.

337
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:21,728
But then you got shot.
Now you's a basehead.

338
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,998
You're messed up. Your life is crap.

339
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:27,160
I know I look like stir-fried shit.

340
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,561
Hook me up with some food.

341
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,430
There's a line. You got to wait.

342
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,765
Give this man something to eat.

343
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:36,706
Hook me up.

344
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,110
This all I get?

345
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,242
You want more?

346
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,547
I'm a veteran.

347
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:45,686
Here. How's that, all right?

348
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:49,951
Clean yourself up,
maybe I'll give you a job.

349
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:51,157
All right, man.

350
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:52,723
Want to buy a turkey?

351
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:54,584
I'm going to keep an eye on him.

352
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:02,529
You don't deserve that turkey.
I hooked you up for that last get-high.

353
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,032
Why I got to be owing you?

354
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:08,838
I was prom queen of King High School.

355
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,839
This is beneath me.

356
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,248
You were the prom queen.
Now you're the prom fiend.

357
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,416
Look at you.

358
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:21,649
Hey what?

359
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,488
Didn't I hook you up?
Didn't I walk those 6 blocks...

360
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:29,129
...to get that pipe from that Iranian
who tried to beat me out of $5?

361
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:34,765
Didn't I speak to your mother after
the bitch called me a homeless bastard?

362
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,594
Add all that up...

363
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:40,967
...and the fact that I'm a man who can
beat your ass, I say it's my turkey.

364
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,937
Get away! Get the fuck away!

365
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,072
Stop beating on her! Stop it!

366
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:58,383
Let go of me, man.

367
00:27:58,993 --> 00:28:03,521
You chump! Beat her up over a turkey.
You're a poor excuse for a brother.

368
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:08,064
Shit, man! Fuck! Shit!
It's a cop! It's a cop!

369
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:10,862
Shut up!

370
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:18,108
Shut up or I'll blow your brains out.

371
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,547
Don't hurt me.

372
00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:23,079
- Shut up!
- I know I was wrong to beat that girl.

373
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:24,943
Crack has got me.

374
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:28,650
I got no control over it.
I tried to kick...

375
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:33,053
...but the shit be calling me.
It be calling me. I got to go to it.

376
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,854
- I need help, man.
- Come on, man.

377
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,063
- We got a crack monster.
- Your mother's a monster.

378
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,272
- Hold him.
- What you writing?

379
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,977
"Pookie" Benny Robinson. Your name.

380
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:55,146
- I'm trying to help you.
- You ain't helping nobody!

381
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:57,351
- It's for your own good.
- Fuck you, man!

382
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:58,608
They'll hook you up.

383
00:28:58,887 --> 00:28:59,876
I'm going to die!

384
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,750
They're going to help you.
They'll help you.

385
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:25,478
I had pretty much
everything I ever wanted.

386
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:27,647
Everything I thought I wanted.

387
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,549
I always had a need for acceptance.

388
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,911
All my friends were doing it.

389
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,951
Thought I could quit anytime.

390
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,450
That's when I woke up in the hospital.

391
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:41,520
It's a very simple program.

392
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,957
We only ask that you don't use
or drink one day at a time.

393
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:47,860
Don't leave before the miracle happens.

394
00:29:50,104 --> 00:29:52,129
This program has revolving doors.

395
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,376
But just because you go out,
don't mean you can come back in.

396
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:10,090
It's crazy, because...

397
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:15,323
...I did everything. I whored.
I ripped my family off.

398
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,225
I was so scandalous,
I would even sell my baby's Pampers.

399
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,231
I have a crack baby.

400
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:24,704
He was born blind.

401
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:30,005
I know why he's blind.
Everybody knows why he's blind.

402
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:34,676
I kept telling myself I was
going to kick, but I never did.

403
00:30:35,316 --> 00:30:36,749
I'm a junkie.

404
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,344
I'll be one the rest of my life.

405
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,410
It's the first time
I've ever been away for so long...

406
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:10,879
...and personally, I hope I never see
you motherfuckers again.

407
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:15,049
When I get out, I'll just take
everything one day at a time.

408
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:16,789
One day at a time.

409
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:27,562
Chill out. You been out two minutes
and already you want a job.

410
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:31,396
It's not just a job. You saved my life.

411
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:36,006
Let me pay you back.
Let me help you bring Nino down.

412
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,337
He promised me a job.
I'll take his money...

413
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:40,581
...and report to you.

414
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:42,076
I don't know.

415
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,078
You know what will happen
if I stay on the streets.

416
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:51,188
I need to be a part of something.
If you don't believe in me, who will?

417
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,399
<i>Cool. You've been inside,
checked out the operations.</i>

418
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,596
All right, Pookie.
Parks, come help me out.

419
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:06,840
Tell me what goes on in this dump.

420
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,804
It took me a while,
but I've been through the whole joint.

421
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:14,537
First, at the entrance, you got to
show a membership card to this runner.

422
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,815
<i>It's like a video club.</i>

423
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:20,179
<i>Nino's got it hooked up
like Mission: Lmpossible.</i>

424
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,983
<i>Walking through that courtyard's
like a nightmare.</i>

425
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:26,453
<i>It's a nation full of zombies.</i>

426
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:40,698
<i>You're escorted to the 2nd floor where
a worker rings a buzzer and a code.</i>

427
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,977
<i>A little panel on the wall opens up,
you get the crack.</i>

428
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:46,303
<i>The code, the buzzer where that go?</i>

429
00:32:46,614 --> 00:32:51,415
<i>The call goes to the "Drug Store"
where they make the crack.</i>

430
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:56,622
<i>I heard they got everybody in there
butt naked. Titties hanging...</i>

431
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:59,292
Nino don't trust a motherfucker.

432
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:08,128
Nino's one sick genius.

433
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,134
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
What happens at the Drug Store?

434
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,968
After that, you can take your goodies
home or stay at the Enterprise.

435
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,010
<i>What's the Enterprise?</i>

436
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,373
<i>What am I, your ghetto tour guide?</i>

437
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:23,446
<i>They got all this equipment
and you don't know shit.</i>

438
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,812
<i>When you're smoking crack, they say
that you're "beaming up to Scotty."</i>

439
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,023
<i>You're going to another world.</i>

440
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:34,194
<i>Crack is the final frontier. That's why
they call that room the Enterprise.</i>

441
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:40,193
<i>People sit down and light that
glass dick and take a hit.</i>

442
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:46,172
<i>That's some scary shit. Their eyes look
like a rocket ready to blast off.</i>

443
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:48,832
Nino has most of the apartments?

444
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,171
Man, are you deaf, or what?
The boy controls the whole place.

445
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,416
Nino Brown's a mad scientist.

446
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:59,983
What did Marvin say? "The boy that
made slaves out of men"? That's Nino.

447
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:01,844
That's deep.

448
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,124
Happy New Year!

449
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,898
Welcome to the Spotlite
with the Flavor Flav.

450
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:19,332
Everybody say "Happy...

451
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,302
...New Year!"

452
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,343
The fruit of our hard work.

453
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,804
The belief in the
entrepreneurial spirit.

454
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,140
The new American Dream.

455
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:31,743
A toast.

456
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:37,615
A toast to my family, in life...

457
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:39,992
...until death.

458
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,693
Happy New Year.

459
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,924
To CMB. On and on.

460
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,869
- Am I my brother's keeper?
- Yes, I am!

461
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,037
Am I my brother's keeper?

462
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:56,270
Am I my brother's keeper?

463
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:00,509
I am!

464
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:15,119
Look at it.

465
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,632
A big reason for this success is you.

466
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,469
But this ain't about success.

467
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,804
This is about survival.

468
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:29,873
We ain't going out like Puss Head,
shot up over a $ 10 bag. You know?

469
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:31,969
You got to be smarter than that.

470
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,411
We got to look out for one another.

471
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,884
I feel the same way.

472
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,551
Nothing and no one
will come between you and me.

473
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,114
Never.

474
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:45,449
Right?

475
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:47,627
I love you.

476
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:49,686
I love you too.

477
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:53,195
Let's go get busy.

478
00:35:57,438 --> 00:35:59,201
Frank Needles out here.

479
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:04,803
Let him in.

480
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:13,143
My ace-boon-coon!
How you doing?

481
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:15,486
Happy New Year.
What's a matter...

482
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:18,385
...too rich to toast the New Year
with an old friend now?

483
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:22,186
If it isn't the thinking man's Rocky.
How are you doing?

484
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:23,760
Great. Love the hair.

485
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:28,434
The Don and I, we was thinking,
let's let bygones be bygones, all right?

486
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:32,832
We congratulate you on your new success,
and as a show of our good faith...

487
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,669
...a gift from the Don.

488
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,208
Open it.

489
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:52,482
<i>To the moolanyan in charge.</i>

490
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,352
All the best, babe.

491
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:07,633
You motherfucking creep!
Think you'll get away with that?

492
00:37:08,342 --> 00:37:09,502
I just did.

493
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,368
Step the fuck off, Gigantor.

494
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:20,446
Now get their silly, spaghetti-eating
asses out of my office.

495
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,990
Frank, come on. Let's go.
Let's get out of here!

496
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:47,581
<i>It's total slamboyancy
in the Spotlite tonight.</i>

497
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:52,376
You're about to get rocked by some
cool, mellow fellows from Brooklyn.

498
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:57,556
I'm talking about Aaron, Damien,
Teddy, Slim, Guy.

499
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:59,289
Give it up.

500
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:08,493
Slim, give a little bit of bass.

501
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:21,404
<i>This is the sound
That get harder and get down</i>

502
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,580
<i>Everyone must know</i>

503
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:30,519
<i>We've been here before
And we're going to give you more</i>

504
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:33,787
<i>It's time to let it show</i>

505
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:36,629
<i>Music is funky</i>

506
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:39,664
<i>Girls are so fly</i>

507
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,529
<i>So sweet and fine</i>

508
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:20,233
Gee Money, come here,
come here, come here.

509
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:24,009
That the skeezer you met
at Frankie's strip joint?

510
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,903
Yeah, Uniqua.

511
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:29,844
What's up, brother?
You fucking her correctly, or what?

512
00:39:30,317 --> 00:39:34,219
Once, but I just met her. You know,
I need time to get to know her.

513
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:36,886
I heard that.

514
00:39:38,926 --> 00:39:40,587
Lord, have mercy.

515
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:48,825
<i>You want to play rough?</i>

516
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,829
<i>Say hello to my little friend.</i>

517
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:03,544
The world is mine.

518
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,285
And the brothers too, now.
Don't forget us.

519
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,054
The world is yours, Nino.

520
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:13,793
Only you won't be as careless
as Tony Montana, now will you?

521
00:40:14,128 --> 00:40:15,857
You absolutely right.

522
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,995
I like this girl of yours.

523
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,699
He ain't got no papers
or a leash on me.

524
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:23,836
You know what happens
when dogs don't have a leash.

525
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:27,368
They run the streets
and fuck everything in sight.

526
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:35,582
It's true. I ain't got no papers
or no leash on her.

527
00:40:35,883 --> 00:40:37,475
But nothing comes between us.

528
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:39,809
The world is mine!

529
00:40:40,154 --> 00:40:41,746
All mine!

530
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:44,657
What the fuck are you doing up there?

531
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:48,056
A man like you, Nino,
needs to leave a legacy.

532
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:52,197
A son. A mark to let the world know
that he was here.

533
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:58,096
You know, you absolutely right.

534
00:40:58,405 --> 00:41:01,431
Shit. It ain't like I ain't
been trying. Ain't that right?

535
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:05,503
She can't have kids.

536
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,138
She can't fuck, either.

537
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:10,576
Maybe that's why she can't have no kids.

538
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:13,513
That ain't right, man.
That ain't right.

539
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:16,952
- She can't?
- She can't.

540
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,456
Too bad.

541
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,854
You're goddamn right that's too bad.

542
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,673
Nino, you need to go get your girl.

543
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,345
You're right. I tell you what.

544
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:54,985
If I was you, I'd be looking
for the pimples on her booty.

545
00:41:57,798 --> 00:41:59,993
Why the fuck did you have
to say that shit?

546
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:02,826
I told you before she couldn't
make no babies!

547
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:07,897
I love you!

548
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:11,501
And now you're taking me for granted.
How can you do that?

549
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:14,212
This is corny!
This is soap-opera shit!

550
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:16,381
- You act like I owe you something.
- You do.

551
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,346
I don't owe you jack.

552
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:22,255
Okay, you did give me
a couple of books to read.

553
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:26,583
And helped me build the brothers. But I
was your ticket out of a boring life...

554
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:31,055
...when your rich doctor daddy was
making house calls at Harlem General.

555
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:33,266
What's up with that? Right?

556
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:38,402
When your kleptomaniac mother
was housing shit in Bloomingdales.

557
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:40,739
Don't throw no shit in my face...

558
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:42,771
You ever touch me again, I'll...

559
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,903
Yeah, I'm aware of that situation.

560
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,077
<i>Stone, your man hired an ex-dealer.</i>

561
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:23,750
I know it seems a little unconventional.
Appleton and Peretti report to me.

562
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:25,814
<i>- Is it out of control?
- Don't worry.</i>

563
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:27,450
<i>Don't blow this.</i>

564
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:30,722
<i>- Does the Commissioner know about this?
- No, not yet.</i>

565
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:31,856
Good.

566
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:40,663
I told you about that new-jack-cop shit.

567
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:45,495
I give you a chance and you hire a
notorious crackhead. What's with you?

568
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,932
Why don't you get off my dick?

569
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:51,837
When you're ready to put your sideline
ass on the frontline, let me know.

570
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,944
Excuse me. Is this
some kind of black thing?

571
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,275
Yes, it is, so keep your
toy Mafia butt out of it!

572
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:02,281
Fuck the Mafia! I'm going to wax
your high-yellow, narrow-ass butt!

573
00:44:03,857 --> 00:44:04,915
Cool it!

574
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:06,682
Relax, all right?

575
00:44:07,027 --> 00:44:10,155
If you won't handle this,
why don't you send the white boy...

576
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,626
...inside the Carter with
the National Guard?

577
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:18,736
What we need is a videotape
of this whole operation.

578
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,133
We need evidence of the
financial records to make it work.

579
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:26,206
I work there. I'm the lookout from
7 p.m. To 7 a. M...

580
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,641
...in one of the apartment windows.

581
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:32,043
I had to fill out an application.
They asked if I still got high.

582
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,082
They remember me from before.

583
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:38,223
Because I was one of their first loyal
customers. I used to get fucked up.

584
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:39,892
Cracker barrel, cracker ass.

585
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:43,154
I got it, I got it.

586
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:54,340
This belt is really a video camera.

587
00:44:54,908 --> 00:44:58,036
These wire transmitters will be
taped to you for sound.

588
00:44:58,312 --> 00:45:02,908
It'll send your communication to us,
as well as sounds and images around you.

589
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,616
It will also pick up
shit you can't even hear.

590
00:45:06,587 --> 00:45:09,215
You'll be great.
You're the best man for this job.

591
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:10,956
You're a fucking genius.

592
00:45:11,258 --> 00:45:12,350
Your mother.

593
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:15,088
Pookie, we're counting on you.

594
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:18,320
You can help us bring down CMB.

595
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,932
Try this on.

596
00:45:22,669 --> 00:45:23,761
You with it?

597
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:25,205
I'm with it, man.

598
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:28,366
Let's roll with it.

599
00:45:28,675 --> 00:45:29,767
Put it on.

600
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:51,289
<i>Pookie, come here, man.
Come here.</i>

601
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:54,097
<i>You know, I told Gee Money
how good you been.</i>

602
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:57,835
<i>How you've been bringing in
lots of customers.</i>

603
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:00,464
<i>And you're just a lookout.</i>

604
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:04,143
<i>Anything that makes them
more money they like.</i>

605
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:05,604
This might be it.

606
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:07,403
<i>We're promoting you.</i>

607
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:08,975
Check it out.

608
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:14,080
<i>Soon. Let's get going with it.</i>

609
00:46:14,488 --> 00:46:15,750
Jackpot! System!

610
00:46:16,056 --> 00:46:17,819
He's inside! Yes!

611
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:20,959
This kid's been bringing us
a lot of business.

612
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:24,263
<i>I'd like to take a shot
at one of those computer terminals.</i>

613
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:27,865
<i>- Can you program PASCAL?
- Can a white man dance?</i>

614
00:46:28,235 --> 00:46:30,863
<i>I guess not. But people change,
they lose interest.</i>

615
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:34,335
<i>Today's your lucky day, homeboy.
I'm promoting your ass.</i>

616
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:37,406
<i>You still on the pipe?</i>

617
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:38,906
<i>No way.</i>

618
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:40,168
<i>Good. Real good.</i>

619
00:46:40,514 --> 00:46:42,778
<i>Because you'll be working
in the Drug Store.</i>

620
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,177
I'm glad you got confidence in me.

621
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:46,781
See you.

622
00:46:49,756 --> 00:46:52,122
- Keep an eye on that kid.
- Why? What's wrong?

623
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:54,850
He's light-fingered.
Keep an eye on the product.

624
00:46:57,865 --> 00:47:01,301
I don't think Pookie's ready
to be in a room full of crack.

625
00:47:01,602 --> 00:47:04,867
I'm ready. Don't I look ready now?
I was born ready.

626
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:06,297
Ready to die.

627
00:47:06,607 --> 00:47:07,869
Stay out of this.

628
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:13,903
He's already on the inside.
With a little more time...

629
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:17,480
...we'll have enough information
to put Nino away for good.

630
00:47:17,784 --> 00:47:19,308
In my opinion, we get him out...

631
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,520
If I want your opinion, I'll give it.

632
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:24,886
I'm against it.

633
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:28,093
- But it's your call.
- And your funeral.

634
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:38,170
We told them, man.

635
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:40,900
Ready? Shit.

636
00:47:41,742 --> 00:47:45,508
You better be ready,
because you owe a lot of people.

637
00:47:45,812 --> 00:47:48,246
You owe me. You owe yourself.

638
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:50,808
You owe the whole community.

639
00:47:51,084 --> 00:47:54,076
You even owe my mother.
Yeah, that's right.

640
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:57,049
A junkie just like you
killed my mother in 1974.

641
00:47:57,324 --> 00:48:00,020
Didn't take money or jewelry.

642
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:02,924
Just took her life.

643
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:07,359
I don't know what you got left in your
so-called rehabilitated body.

644
00:48:07,668 --> 00:48:11,195
But you better find something
because you owe a lot of people.

645
00:48:11,505 --> 00:48:14,030
A lot of people. You owe, Pook.

646
00:49:32,753 --> 00:49:34,448
You got skim milk in them titties?

647
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:40,992
One and a-two and a-three and a-four...

648
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,696
<i>I'll give you something to look at.</i>

649
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,466
Superfly, there's something wrong
with your boy.

650
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:51,234
What's happening with Pookie?

651
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,097
I have no idea.

652
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,205
You should, he's your plant.

653
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:59,137
Cool out. You're jumping the gun.

654
00:49:59,546 --> 00:50:01,480
But something's wrong with your guy.

655
00:50:01,782 --> 00:50:03,647
<i>"Four score and seven years..."</i>

656
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:06,648
- Is that a secret code for help?
- No, it's a black thing.

657
00:50:06,953 --> 00:50:09,820
I'm tired of your stuff.
I'm tired of this dude.

658
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:11,115
<i>What's wrong, fool?</i>

659
00:50:11,391 --> 00:50:15,987
<i>Just doing a workout. This is
a tough job. Got to stay in shape.</i>

660
00:50:17,064 --> 00:50:19,157
A workout like this
boosts worker morale.

661
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:20,658
You think I'm stupid.

662
00:50:21,301 --> 00:50:22,996
You're a high motherfucker.

663
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,534
<i>You 5-0?</i>

664
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,831
- Shit! His cover's blown!
- Let's go!

665
00:50:30,143 --> 00:50:31,735
Are you 5-0?!

666
00:50:33,313 --> 00:50:34,302
<i>Take him outside...</i>

667
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,411
<i>... and kill him!
And blow the building!</i>

668
00:50:36,983 --> 00:50:38,644
<i>Help me! I'm going to die!</i>

669
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:39,951
Let's go!

670
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,168
Let's go!

671
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:31,496
Let me through!
I'll do the bitch!

672
00:51:48,821 --> 00:51:49,913
Clear!

673
00:52:04,737 --> 00:52:07,171
Police! Get out! Come on!

674
00:52:21,854 --> 00:52:24,345
- Nothing here!
- Let's get out of here!

675
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:37,201
Come here. Hold on.
Keep your head down.

676
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:51,982
Scotty!

677
00:52:52,785 --> 00:52:54,275
Where the hell are you?

678
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:03,287
Touch him, it blows.

679
00:53:03,562 --> 00:53:05,223
- Do this.
- There's too many wires.

680
00:53:05,564 --> 00:53:06,656
Pick one.

681
00:53:07,399 --> 00:53:08,627
Come on!

682
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:11,061
Light! I can't see! Give me a light!

683
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:12,502
Hold it there.

684
00:53:12,805 --> 00:53:14,238
Scotty, on 3...

685
00:53:14,473 --> 00:53:17,738
...I want you to slowly,
gently pull out the blue wire.

686
00:53:21,947 --> 00:53:22,572
One.

687
00:53:30,356 --> 00:53:31,323
One's the ground.

688
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,249
Which?

689
00:53:32,591 --> 00:53:34,218
- I don't know!
- 3 seconds left!

690
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:26,136
I knew it! You ain't nothing
but a high-priced whore.

691
00:54:26,645 --> 00:54:28,510
<i>Put Nino on, bitch.</i>

692
00:54:29,148 --> 00:54:30,581
It's for you.

693
00:54:35,721 --> 00:54:37,154
What's up?

694
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:40,654
<i>I know you're having a good time,
but we were infiltrated.</i>

695
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:44,157
We shut down the Carter.

696
00:54:45,331 --> 00:54:46,923
Get your ass out here right now!

697
00:54:47,566 --> 00:54:48,658
<i>Now!</i>

698
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,829
Stop!

699
00:55:09,355 --> 00:55:10,447
What happened?

700
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,918
Don't nobody know nothing?

701
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:18,356
Don't everybody speak at once.

702
00:55:19,765 --> 00:55:21,665
How the motherfucker get in?

703
00:55:24,436 --> 00:55:28,372
Out of all you motherfuckers,
nobody knows jack shit?

704
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:35,375
The Duh Duh Man.
Duh Duh, what happened?

705
00:55:41,553 --> 00:55:43,316
I'll be a motherfucker.

706
00:55:43,722 --> 00:55:45,815
Don't nobody know nothing?

707
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:48,321
What up with this?

708
00:55:50,129 --> 00:55:52,825
Somebody got to know something
was going on.

709
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:54,394
See what I'm saying?

710
00:55:55,067 --> 00:55:56,557
Ain't that right, Gee Money?

711
00:55:57,403 --> 00:56:00,065
I think Gee Money definitely
knows something.

712
00:56:00,706 --> 00:56:02,230
Gee Money knows something.

713
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,175
You fucked up. You fucked up bigtime.

714
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,014
You're incapable of running this shit.

715
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:14,352
Sit your five-dollar ass down
before I make change.

716
00:56:15,988 --> 00:56:18,081
Kareem brought him to my attention.

717
00:56:18,757 --> 00:56:20,315
We got 300 employees.

718
00:56:20,592 --> 00:56:23,755
I can't keep my eye on all of them.

719
00:56:25,664 --> 00:56:27,325
If you was taking care of business...

720
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,568
What? If I was what?
Say it again!

721
00:56:30,836 --> 00:56:31,598
What?!

722
00:56:33,672 --> 00:56:34,331
Nothing.

723
00:56:34,606 --> 00:56:38,337
That's what I thought you said.
Because that's what I got, nothing!

724
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:41,773
A million-dollar-a-week business
reduced to rubbish!

725
00:56:47,286 --> 00:56:48,583
It's your responsibility.

726
00:56:57,696 --> 00:57:00,790
I never liked you anyway,
pretty motherfucker.

727
00:57:12,544 --> 00:57:16,071
What's the matter, Gee?
What's up with you?

728
00:57:16,815 --> 00:57:21,582
Why are you letting some shit like who
I'm laying the pipe to fuck with you?

729
00:57:21,887 --> 00:57:23,479
You're bigger than that.

730
00:57:25,491 --> 00:57:29,086
Something like this
can never happen again.

731
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:53,843
Now...

732
00:57:56,688 --> 00:57:58,019
...leave me.

733
00:58:00,259 --> 00:58:02,159
Get the fuck out.

734
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:33,985
What Gee Money has brought together...

735
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,494
...let no man put asunder.

736
00:58:37,629 --> 00:58:39,722
I now pronounce us man...

737
00:58:40,132 --> 00:58:41,394
...and wife.

738
00:58:43,735 --> 00:58:45,225
You may kiss the bride.

739
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:56,176
Be not deceived.
Neither fornicators, nor idolaters...

740
00:58:56,481 --> 00:59:00,110
...nor adulterers, nor abusers
of themselves with mankind...

741
00:59:00,385 --> 00:59:02,785
...shall inherit the kingdom of God.

742
00:59:03,422 --> 00:59:05,754
May your soul rest in peace.

743
00:59:06,258 --> 00:59:07,589
Goodbye, Pookie.

744
00:59:18,437 --> 00:59:20,701
The Commissioner's been
on my ass all night.

745
00:59:21,173 --> 00:59:25,940
Washington is blaming us for losing
thousands of dollars in man-hours.

746
00:59:26,778 --> 00:59:28,939
Not to mention all the cops
we got killed.

747
00:59:30,282 --> 00:59:32,273
The operation was a failure.

748
00:59:33,285 --> 00:59:35,446
We didn't arrest anyone.
No one, man.

749
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:40,382
We didn't get any evidence. Nothing.
No financial records, nothing.

750
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:44,791
We still could be out there
fighting scum like Nino Brown...

751
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:46,791
...except for two things:

752
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:54,530
I gambled on you,
and you gambled on a crackhead.

753
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,098
Fuck that!

754
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:57,433
That's enough, man!

755
00:59:59,478 --> 01:00:03,471
I'm sorry you lost your budget.
But I lost a friend.

756
01:00:07,552 --> 01:00:08,314
Let it go.

757
01:00:08,987 --> 01:00:10,477
Operation's over.

758
01:00:15,227 --> 01:00:16,319
It's over.

759
01:00:19,564 --> 01:00:23,000
It ain't over.
Pookie didn't die for nothing.

760
01:00:26,505 --> 01:00:27,995
<i>Operation's gone...</i>

761
01:00:28,507 --> 01:00:31,135
...Nino's loose, Pookie is dead.

762
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:33,241
I got Pookie killed.

763
01:00:33,512 --> 01:00:37,107
Cut out this self-pitying shit
about you killing Pookie.

764
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:40,180
If anyone killed him it was me.
I could see it.

765
01:00:40,585 --> 01:00:43,349
How you going to tell me
you killed Pookie?

766
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:48,690
Do you remember
when you said I didn't care?

767
01:00:51,196 --> 01:00:54,859
When what the hell was I doing
at Pookie's funeral anyway? Remember?

768
01:00:57,869 --> 01:00:59,598
I used to be Pookie.

769
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:02,305
How the hell you used to be Pookie?

770
01:01:02,607 --> 01:01:04,802
I was a poor white-trash Pookie.

771
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:09,169
This whole drug shit, it's not
a black thing, it's not a white thing.

772
01:01:10,115 --> 01:01:13,209
It's a death thing.
Death doesn't give a shit about color.

773
01:01:15,387 --> 01:01:16,820
You don't have to like me.

774
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:19,481
I don't even know if I like you.

775
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:25,052
But we're in this together now, partner.

776
01:01:25,564 --> 01:01:30,160
You know, a drug dealer
is the worst kind of brother.

777
01:01:31,236 --> 01:01:34,637
He won't sell it to his sister.
He won't sell it to his mother.

778
01:01:34,906 --> 01:01:37,170
But he'll sell it
to his boys in the street.

779
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:40,069
I don't know about you...

780
01:01:41,646 --> 01:01:43,841
...but I'm ready to kill Nino Brown.

781
01:01:44,816 --> 01:01:46,249
Are you with me?

782
01:01:48,086 --> 01:01:49,519
I'm ahead of you.

783
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:06,633
Behind door number 1,
your head explodes like a melon.

784
01:02:07,372 --> 01:02:11,741
Behind door 2, you hook us up with
Gee Money and get the prize, Nino Brown.

785
01:02:13,278 --> 01:02:14,870
Let's make a deal.

786
01:02:17,716 --> 01:02:21,652
You and me always had an understanding.
Besides, I needed a haircut, right?

787
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:29,158
<i>My cugino and his friend are hungry.</i>

788
01:02:30,228 --> 01:02:33,322
And I got a feeling
that they can cut you a sweeter deal...

789
01:02:33,632 --> 01:02:35,224
...than any Peruvian.

790
01:02:35,567 --> 01:02:38,058
Enough to maybe throw in
a finder's fee for me.

791
01:02:42,307 --> 01:02:43,740
If I swim with this offer...

792
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:48,537
You wanted to meet the main man, that's
done. From now on you deal with me...

793
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,142
...and me only.

794
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:07,956
You will cut me a side deal.

795
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,662
20 percent.

796
01:03:10,502 --> 01:03:12,936
And you will be obligated
to report to me...

797
01:03:13,338 --> 01:03:14,703
...and me only.

798
01:03:16,775 --> 01:03:17,707
Give me your number.

799
01:03:44,469 --> 01:03:45,629
Don Armeteo.

800
01:03:46,638 --> 01:03:48,503
Nino is about to itch.

801
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:55,307
- What the fuck is up?
- What's up? Play ball, that's what.

802
01:03:56,381 --> 01:03:57,348
Check!

803
01:04:05,557 --> 01:04:06,649
Can I help you?

804
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:08,391
I'm here to see Gee Money.

805
01:04:09,261 --> 01:04:11,195
- What's up with these elbows?
- Sucker!

806
01:04:11,563 --> 01:04:12,791
I don't know you.

807
01:04:13,899 --> 01:04:14,991
You know him?

808
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,894
Hold up. I know him. He's cool.

809
01:04:19,004 --> 01:04:21,234
Ease back, playboy. Ease back.

810
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,041
How you feeling, Gee Money, my man?

811
01:04:27,412 --> 01:04:29,175
What's up with your man?

812
01:04:31,483 --> 01:04:32,507
Pat him down.

813
01:04:33,618 --> 01:04:34,676
Pat him down!

814
01:04:36,988 --> 01:04:38,421
It's like that?

815
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:41,891
What the fuck is this?

816
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,321
I don't know you, that's what.

817
01:04:45,096 --> 01:04:47,189
I know you're my man's new contact...

818
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,066
...but I don't trust you.

819
01:04:49,334 --> 01:04:52,201
So since you're interrupting my game,
get the fuck out.

820
01:04:58,009 --> 01:04:58,839
Mr. Money?

821
01:04:59,177 --> 01:05:02,578
Please escort Mr. Washington
off the court. Take him down the block.

822
01:05:02,847 --> 01:05:05,714
And if this dreadlocked
boomboorah even blinks wrong...

823
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:07,680
...you lullaby his ass.

824
01:05:13,525 --> 01:05:16,517
Don't forget what we talked about
before at Frankie's.

825
01:05:16,795 --> 01:05:19,059
I'm definitely going to be
the next king.

826
01:05:20,298 --> 01:05:22,960
Yo, Keish, I seen that boy
somewhere before.

827
01:05:28,306 --> 01:05:32,675
That's right, I checked him out myself.
He cooler than a fan.

828
01:05:33,144 --> 01:05:37,137
And the product is 60% cheaper
than what the brothers is paying now.

829
01:05:37,816 --> 01:05:40,876
<i>That will free up
a whole lot of money...</i>

830
01:05:41,186 --> 01:05:43,120
<i>... to do a lot of other things.</i>

831
01:05:43,822 --> 01:05:46,052
Like, maybe take over
another city project?

832
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:48,659
<i>All right, let's roll with it.</i>

833
01:05:48,994 --> 01:05:51,087
<i>We build and get stronger.</i>

834
01:05:51,396 --> 01:05:53,421
Most definite. Most definite.

835
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:55,461
<i>Money, I'll tell you something.</i>

836
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,834
If he's not who he says he is...

837
01:05:58,236 --> 01:05:59,669
...l'll kill him.

838
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:02,272
Then I'll kill you.

839
01:06:07,278 --> 01:06:11,339
<i>I don't trust Mr. Washington. So I want
him to stick to me like flies to shit.</i>

840
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,721
When I was young, I was a member
of this gang called the L.A. Boys.

841
01:06:19,024 --> 01:06:20,286
- Lennox Ave.
- You know it.

842
01:06:21,426 --> 01:06:26,125
The leader, Jughead, told me to prove
my loyalty, I had to snuff somebody out.

843
01:06:27,532 --> 01:06:29,124
It was like, "No problem."

844
01:06:29,434 --> 01:06:32,961
I said, "An enemy?"
He said, "No, that's too easy."

845
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:35,034
"It's got to be an ordinary mo."

846
01:06:36,207 --> 01:06:37,868
So I rode down to 23rd.

847
01:06:38,209 --> 01:06:41,542
Copped me a bag of that
Red Devil angel dust.

848
01:06:46,551 --> 01:06:48,416
I got so zooted.

849
01:06:50,288 --> 01:06:54,190
I walked up on this lady. She must have
been a schoolteacher or something.

850
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,494
I was so fucking crazy, man,
I didn't even care.

851
01:06:58,963 --> 01:07:00,487
I stepped to her.

852
01:07:06,304 --> 01:07:08,329
I didn't even stay to see her body drop.

853
01:07:09,074 --> 01:07:10,507
I just ran.

854
01:07:13,311 --> 01:07:15,006
You must think I'm a demon.

855
01:07:17,582 --> 01:07:19,516
I guess what you was doing...

856
01:07:20,752 --> 01:07:23,186
...it was like business, right?

857
01:07:24,489 --> 01:07:25,683
It wasn't personal.

858
01:07:26,658 --> 01:07:27,750
My brother...

859
01:07:28,993 --> 01:07:30,585
...it's always business.

860
01:07:31,496 --> 01:07:32,861
Never personal.

861
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,265
- Tell your moms I want some bean pies.
- Can I get some?

862
01:07:39,604 --> 01:07:41,037
Come on in, little man.

863
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:46,943
Two for you.

864
01:07:52,283 --> 01:07:53,443
Two for you.

865
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,585
- Hold up, pop.
- Get your butt out of here, now.

866
01:08:03,628 --> 01:08:05,391
I can take care of you too, old man.

867
01:08:05,663 --> 01:08:09,121
You better take care of yourself,
because you an ignorant bastard.

868
01:08:09,467 --> 01:08:11,128
You committing genocide
on your people...

869
01:08:11,402 --> 01:08:13,302
...with these silk suits and fancy cars.

870
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:14,796
Step off, grandpa.

871
01:08:17,008 --> 01:08:17,940
Idol worshiper.

872
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:21,610
You killing your own people with the
white devils you put in that bottle.

873
01:08:21,846 --> 01:08:23,609
You an idolater.

874
01:08:23,882 --> 01:08:25,941
Reverend Oates,
why are you with this scum?

875
01:08:26,217 --> 01:08:26,979
Shut up!

876
01:08:27,318 --> 01:08:29,809
Nino, let me smoke this old dude.

877
01:08:37,295 --> 01:08:38,262
Look at you.

878
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:41,398
In 2 years, they'll be
marking your gravesite.

879
01:08:42,233 --> 01:08:44,633
Me? I'll be right here.

880
01:08:47,338 --> 01:08:48,771
All you kids,
get out of here!

881
01:08:54,078 --> 01:08:55,340
These kids...

882
01:08:56,915 --> 01:09:00,578
...all these people
gather around you like you God Almighty.

883
01:09:01,085 --> 01:09:02,518
Like you love them.

884
01:09:02,854 --> 01:09:04,321
Devils ain't got no love.

885
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:05,851
You're killing your people.

886
01:09:06,257 --> 01:09:07,849
What can you offer them?

887
01:09:08,193 --> 01:09:09,854
Another "I have a dream" speech?

888
01:09:10,228 --> 01:09:12,856
Some of that same shit
you ripping off to me?

889
01:09:13,464 --> 01:09:17,025
Look where we at. Not a pot to piss in,
nor a window to throw it out of.

890
01:09:17,502 --> 01:09:18,833
You's the fool, old man.

891
01:09:23,107 --> 01:09:25,541
Don't try it, old man.
Don't even think about.

892
01:09:30,815 --> 01:09:32,305
You don't understand, do you?

893
01:09:34,786 --> 01:09:37,550
Idolater, you reap what you sow!

894
01:09:55,974 --> 01:09:57,669
This is some fly shit.

895
01:09:58,076 --> 01:10:01,807
Some George Raft- some
James Cagney-type shit.

896
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,377
You know what I'm saying?

897
01:10:03,648 --> 01:10:06,173
- That's how you living, baby.
- Living large, brother.

898
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:15,421
Good looking out this afternoon
with that madness.

899
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,990
Gee Money should've seen it coming.

900
01:10:20,498 --> 01:10:22,432
Old man really wanted to do me,
didn't he?

901
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:26,328
Old bastard.

902
01:10:27,772 --> 01:10:30,434
But here's something
you might not find so funny.

903
01:10:30,942 --> 01:10:33,775
Your boy Gee Money tried to cut
a side deal with me.

904
01:10:39,617 --> 01:10:42,051
You can't trust anybody these days.

905
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:45,956
You can trust me. I got your back.

906
01:10:50,328 --> 01:10:51,260
Thank you.

907
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:55,625
Now Reverend Oates will say
a few words to the happy couple.

908
01:11:02,206 --> 01:11:05,698
You got to wait till somebody else
gets some too, okay?

909
01:11:09,314 --> 01:11:12,306
Before we eat up all this cake,
we ought to give a toast...

910
01:11:12,884 --> 01:11:16,376
...to my daughter, my new son-in-law
and our gracious host...

911
01:11:16,654 --> 01:11:17,985
...Mr. Nino Brown.

912
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:43,497
I got something for you.

913
01:12:44,642 --> 01:12:46,906
That's my business card.
Call me sometime.

914
01:13:28,686 --> 01:13:31,280
Hey, what's up? You still mad at me?

915
01:13:31,622 --> 01:13:32,953
Fuck you, then.

916
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:37,557
- Where is the Duh Duh Man?
- Probably after that skeezer he was on.

917
01:13:38,296 --> 01:13:39,558
What's up with Selina?

918
01:13:39,864 --> 01:13:42,264
I don't know. Losing her mind,
that's what's up.

919
01:13:42,533 --> 01:13:45,024
You think I care?
This is my world, my money...

920
01:13:45,303 --> 01:13:46,565
...and that's my skeezer.

921
01:13:52,477 --> 01:13:53,637
Hi, Daddy.

922
01:14:04,822 --> 01:14:06,312
Thank you, mister.

923
01:14:14,799 --> 01:14:15,823
Cover me!

924
01:14:35,786 --> 01:14:36,775
Throw me a gun!

925
01:14:38,156 --> 01:14:39,316
Get down!

926
01:14:51,936 --> 01:14:53,130
Motherfuckers!

927
01:15:31,976 --> 01:15:34,069
You're a murderer, Nino!

928
01:15:34,912 --> 01:15:37,745
I've seen you kill too many people!

929
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:41,751
Cancel that bitch.

930
01:15:42,253 --> 01:15:43,743
I'll buy another one.

931
01:15:46,991 --> 01:15:48,390
I hate you!

932
01:15:49,026 --> 01:15:50,857
I hate you, Nino!

933
01:15:53,998 --> 01:15:55,932
Don Armeteo's on the phone for you.

934
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:02,171
We made you. We gave you everything.

935
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:06,774
Shagazzy's, the Spotlite,
the street corners.

936
01:16:08,512 --> 01:16:11,743
So you got cute.
You had to get spanked.

937
01:16:12,016 --> 01:16:14,541
Now you listen to me. I made this. Me.

938
01:16:14,919 --> 01:16:17,547
I own this city, you slicked-back,
greasy-haired...

939
01:16:17,822 --> 01:16:18,754
<i>... son of a bitch!</i>

940
01:16:19,023 --> 01:16:20,422
You're fucked!

941
01:17:00,231 --> 01:17:01,664
<i>This bulletin just in.</i>

942
01:17:01,999 --> 01:17:05,560
<i>In a scene to rival the famed
St. Valentine's Day Massacre...</i>

943
01:17:05,836 --> 01:17:07,497
<i>... of 1920's Chicago...</i>

944
01:17:07,838 --> 01:17:11,968
<i>... Don Armeteo, reputed crime lord,
and 10 of his henchmen...</i>

945
01:17:12,243 --> 01:17:14,438
<i>... were gunned down this afternoon...</i>

946
01:17:14,745 --> 01:17:17,646
<i>I put you two together.
And you guys go off on your own...</i>

947
01:17:17,882 --> 01:17:19,281
...and now you want to come back.

948
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:21,915
You're telling me the disk I took
isn't important?

949
01:17:22,186 --> 01:17:25,121
I'm telling you,
I hope it is important.

950
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:26,920
This is Hawkins.

951
01:17:27,258 --> 01:17:29,954
We go back to law school.
She's the prosecuting attorney.

952
01:17:31,095 --> 01:17:34,030
The son of a bitch used a little girl
as a bulletproof vest.

953
01:17:34,365 --> 01:17:37,095
Watch your language.
Nino is going to fall.

954
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:40,802
- What about the Pookie video?
- It helps, but it's not enough.

955
01:17:41,105 --> 01:17:43,437
Nino isn't in any of the tapes
at the Carter.

956
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:45,335
He's becoming Mr. Untouchable.

957
01:17:47,545 --> 01:17:50,878
How many more got to get killed?
I could have smoked this fool myself.

958
01:17:51,215 --> 01:17:54,776
Can we catch him in a drug buy?
Or get a witness who will testify...

959
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:56,643
...to connect all the dots?

960
01:17:56,954 --> 01:18:01,721
Nino's got great connections. Can we
nail any of them and tie them to Nino?

961
01:18:02,393 --> 01:18:03,826
Check this out.

962
01:18:04,395 --> 01:18:07,694
We got it set up so the
CMB brothers will buy from us.

963
01:18:08,466 --> 01:18:11,867
And I also got it so Nino Brown
definitely doesn't trust Gee Money.

964
01:18:12,136 --> 01:18:14,070
And we'll get it on videotape.

965
01:18:36,827 --> 01:18:38,192
What's up, fellows?

966
01:18:38,829 --> 01:18:40,023
Got the bucks?

967
01:18:40,331 --> 01:18:43,027
So nice of you to make it.
Know what I'm saying?

968
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:44,593
What can I say?

969
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:47,227
What's taking him so long?

970
01:18:47,772 --> 01:18:49,399
Nino's not moving. Shit.

971
01:18:49,673 --> 01:18:50,367
Let's do this.

972
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:52,172
Open the briefcase.

973
01:18:56,814 --> 01:18:57,974
Easy.

974
01:18:58,516 --> 01:18:59,676
Very easy.

975
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:01,281
I thought we was friends.

976
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:04,213
I told you, it's never personal, B.

977
01:19:04,522 --> 01:19:07,218
Friends is friends. This is business.

978
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:08,753
Let's see the sample.

979
01:19:09,026 --> 01:19:10,118
Whatever.

980
01:19:17,535 --> 01:19:18,763
All here, baby.

981
01:19:19,303 --> 01:19:21,771
I knew I knew Washington. He's 5-0.

982
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:25,599
Suck-ass motherfucker.

983
01:19:28,412 --> 01:19:30,141
Punch it! Just do it!

984
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:55,080
You cut a side deal
with that motherfucker.

985
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:58,945
Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Gee.

986
01:23:00,591 --> 01:23:01,990
Fucking Cain.

987
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,787
My brother's keeper.

988
01:23:06,096 --> 01:23:07,529
Was it this...

989
01:23:08,432 --> 01:23:10,957
...glass dick you've been sucking on?

990
01:23:13,203 --> 01:23:17,037
Was that it? Now I see how
you let that motherfucker infiltrate.

991
01:23:17,775 --> 01:23:19,470
He used you, Gee.

992
01:23:28,552 --> 01:23:32,181
What ever happened to,
"Am I my brother's keeper?"

993
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:34,982
You know what happened to it.

994
01:23:37,895 --> 01:23:39,829
"The world is mine."

995
01:23:42,633 --> 01:23:43,565
Remember that?

996
01:23:45,669 --> 01:23:49,070
"Everything is mine. Everything!"

997
01:23:50,474 --> 01:23:51,907
Even my woman.

998
01:23:52,976 --> 01:23:54,876
Is that what this is about?

999
01:23:55,145 --> 01:23:56,510
That fucking skeezer?

1000
01:23:56,814 --> 01:23:58,406
You think I give a fuck about her?

1001
01:23:58,682 --> 01:24:01,310
Fuck that ho bitch!
I don't give a fuck about her!

1002
01:24:01,652 --> 01:24:03,586
It ain't about her.

1003
01:24:05,255 --> 01:24:06,688
It's about us.

1004
01:24:10,828 --> 01:24:12,193
I love you, man.

1005
01:24:20,003 --> 01:24:22,028
You embarrassed me, man!

1006
01:24:25,275 --> 01:24:28,301
In front of all them people,
you treated me like I was soft.

1007
01:24:28,579 --> 01:24:30,877
You treated me like I was spineless!

1008
01:24:32,182 --> 01:24:36,050
We built this shit!
You didn't do this shit by yourself!

1009
01:24:37,354 --> 01:24:40,619
You forgot about me, man, your brother.

1010
01:24:42,126 --> 01:24:43,787
What has this done to us?

1011
01:24:48,031 --> 01:24:49,123
Keisha...

1012
01:24:49,633 --> 01:24:50,793
...dead.

1013
01:24:51,869 --> 01:24:53,234
The Duh Duh Man...

1014
01:24:54,071 --> 01:24:54,969
...dead.

1015
01:24:57,374 --> 01:24:59,365
Let's just make it like it was.

1016
01:25:00,811 --> 01:25:03,644
Let's be a family.
Let's make it like it was.

1017
01:25:03,981 --> 01:25:07,473
Fuck them cars and
them bitches and all that shit.

1018
01:25:07,818 --> 01:25:09,752
Fuck that shit!

1019
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:14,290
Let's do us, me and you.
Let's be a family again.

1020
01:25:26,236 --> 01:25:27,931
I'm on the run.

1021
01:25:30,073 --> 01:25:32,166
It can never go back the way it was.

1022
01:25:36,013 --> 01:25:40,109
But I'll tell you how
we can make it right.

1023
01:25:51,428 --> 01:25:52,690
CMB.

1024
01:25:53,597 --> 01:25:54,859
CMB!

1025
01:25:55,365 --> 01:25:56,855
We all we got.

1026
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:02,304
Am I my brother's keeper?

1027
01:26:10,881 --> 01:26:12,644
Yes, I am.

1028
01:26:23,227 --> 01:26:25,320
You know where Nino Brown lives?

1029
01:26:25,796 --> 01:26:28,162
You heard my man.
I ain't telling you shit.

1030
01:26:28,565 --> 01:26:31,659
Last summer, me and my boys won
this basketball tournament.

1031
01:26:31,969 --> 01:26:35,461
Bought the whole team brand-new
red scooters. So you can kiss my ass.

1032
01:26:35,739 --> 01:26:36,797
Kiss my ass with that.

1033
01:26:37,074 --> 01:26:41,135
You know something, B?
This dude is a cop. 5-0! B, out!

1034
01:26:41,812 --> 01:26:42,744
Come here, punk!

1035
01:26:45,215 --> 01:26:46,842
I know where Nino lives.

1036
01:26:47,217 --> 01:26:49,913
He beat this kid who
scrambled for him with a bat.

1037
01:26:50,254 --> 01:26:52,484
Poured gas on him and set him on fire...

1038
01:26:52,923 --> 01:26:55,187
...after he shorted him $5.

1039
01:26:55,492 --> 01:26:58,086
I hope you kill his black, hardened ass.

1040
01:26:58,996 --> 01:27:00,759
He's in apartment 6C.

1041
01:27:01,098 --> 01:27:03,760
But watch out.
He got bodyguards on the roof.

1042
01:27:08,171 --> 01:27:10,605
<i>Say hello to my little friend.</i>

1043
01:27:18,181 --> 01:27:19,443
Buckwheat.

1044
01:28:21,111 --> 01:28:21,907
Punk!

1045
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:25,075
Kill him!

1046
01:28:25,349 --> 01:28:29,342
How the hell can you wear this and sell
poison to our people? You ain't shit!

1047
01:28:34,524 --> 01:28:35,513
Toss him down to me.

1048
01:28:42,366 --> 01:28:44,698
That teacher you killed?
That was my mother!

1049
01:28:47,704 --> 01:28:49,672
Kick his black ass!

1050
01:28:52,709 --> 01:28:55,701
These are the people you squash
and kill with no retribution.

1051
01:28:57,547 --> 01:28:58,707
Get your ass up.

1052
01:29:05,856 --> 01:29:08,120
This ain't business, bitch.
This is personal.

1053
01:29:13,797 --> 01:29:16,732
I want to shoot you so bad,
my dick's hard.

1054
01:29:16,933 --> 01:29:18,332
Coming through, excuse me.

1055
01:29:21,471 --> 01:29:22,904
We'll do this the right way.

1056
01:29:24,641 --> 01:29:25,665
I'll testify.

1057
01:29:25,942 --> 01:29:28,308
Even if it means my life,
I will testify.

1058
01:29:28,578 --> 01:29:29,510
Come on.

1059
01:29:29,746 --> 01:29:31,043
We can't go out like this.

1060
01:29:31,481 --> 01:29:32,641
Put the gun down.

1061
01:29:41,258 --> 01:29:43,749
Don't throw your life away
on a piece of shit.

1062
01:29:48,298 --> 01:29:50,129
Give me the gun. I'll do it.

1063
01:30:01,445 --> 01:30:03,106
I'll be out in a week.

1064
01:30:04,448 --> 01:30:06,040
You're a dead man.

1065
01:30:13,657 --> 01:30:18,219
Was the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown,
head of the CMB?

1066
01:30:30,974 --> 01:30:33,408
Remove the hat and the sunglasses.

1067
01:30:35,879 --> 01:30:39,406
Detective Appleton, when you
infiltrated the CMB...

1068
01:30:39,749 --> 01:30:42,183
...did the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown...

1069
01:30:42,452 --> 01:30:47,321
...attempt to buy two and a half kilos
of cocaine from you?

1070
01:30:47,991 --> 01:30:50,152
Did he? Can Michael Jordan slam-dunk?

1071
01:30:50,494 --> 01:30:52,962
Of course he did. He's a dope dealer.

1072
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:55,323
That's what they do, buy and sell dope.

1073
01:30:57,134 --> 01:30:58,431
I'm not guilty.

1074
01:30:58,935 --> 01:31:00,664
You're the one who's guilty.

1075
01:31:01,638 --> 01:31:04,937
You lawmakers, the politicians,
the Colombian drug lords...

1076
01:31:05,242 --> 01:31:08,109
...all you who lobby against
making drugs legal.

1077
01:31:08,512 --> 01:31:11,310
Just like you did with alcohol
during Prohibition.

1078
01:31:11,581 --> 01:31:13,276
You're the one who's guilty.

1079
01:31:14,684 --> 01:31:17,175
Let's kick the ballistics here.

1080
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:19,955
Ain't no Uzis made in Harlem.

1081
01:31:20,423 --> 01:31:24,359
Not one of us in here
owns a poppy field.

1082
01:31:24,694 --> 01:31:27,686
This thing is bigger than Nino Brown.
This is big business.

1083
01:31:28,031 --> 01:31:29,965
This is the American way.

1084
01:31:31,268 --> 01:31:34,760
I'm sure that the court
was enlightened...

1085
01:31:35,038 --> 01:31:37,370
...by your geopolitical tirade.

1086
01:31:37,707 --> 01:31:41,609
Unfortunately, society at large
is not on trial here.

1087
01:31:41,945 --> 01:31:44,379
You are, Mr. Brown.

1088
01:31:45,081 --> 01:31:46,878
Were you or were you not...

1089
01:31:47,184 --> 01:31:51,985
...head of the narcotics consortium,
the murderously bloody...

1090
01:31:52,255 --> 01:31:53,722
...CMB?

1091
01:31:56,092 --> 01:31:59,061
I could not hear you.
Would you please speak up?

1092
01:31:59,396 --> 01:32:01,489
Yes, I was a member.

1093
01:32:02,065 --> 01:32:04,124
But I was forced into this way of life.

1094
01:32:05,068 --> 01:32:07,730
I've been dealing drugs
ever since I was 12 years old.

1095
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:11,837
I didn't have the chances
that you have, Miss Hawkins.

1096
01:32:12,108 --> 01:32:16,738
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
in my mouth, Miss Hawkins.

1097
01:32:18,915 --> 01:32:23,011
I wanted to get out,
but they threatened to kill my mother.

1098
01:32:23,286 --> 01:32:26,687
Who are you talking about,
Mr. Brown? What "they"?

1099
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:28,422
They.

1100
01:32:29,593 --> 01:32:32,255
Look at him. Kareem Akbar.

1101
01:32:33,697 --> 01:32:37,599
That's right, the educated brother from
the bank. He's the head of the CMB.

1102
01:32:37,867 --> 01:32:39,391
The brains behind the whole thing.

1103
01:32:39,669 --> 01:32:42,661
This is bigger than Nino Brown,
and I got a list to prove it.

1104
01:32:42,939 --> 01:32:45,931
If I'm going down, I'm taking
a lot of people with me.

1105
01:32:46,443 --> 01:32:48,206
Order in the court!

1106
01:33:08,632 --> 01:33:11,624
Your Honor, may counsel
approach the bench?

1107
01:33:13,637 --> 01:33:16,401
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1108
01:33:20,176 --> 01:33:21,643
What's the discussion?

1109
01:33:28,818 --> 01:33:31,252
The court is not pleased
with this application.

1110
01:33:31,721 --> 01:33:35,316
You understand that by pleading
guilty to a lesser charge...

1111
01:33:35,659 --> 01:33:40,426
...the court, under law, can impose
a sentence of 3 years to life...

1112
01:33:41,164 --> 01:33:45,157
...with parole eligibility
after 12 months. Do you understand?

1113
01:33:47,737 --> 01:33:48,965
Absolutely.

1114
01:33:50,407 --> 01:33:52,034
How could you let this happen?

1115
01:33:52,275 --> 01:33:56,234
We wanted some of the crack
off the streets. I wanted Nino too.

1116
01:33:56,513 --> 01:34:00,347
He gave up his connections
and Powell wanted to make the deal.

1117
01:34:01,584 --> 01:34:02,414
Let's go.

1118
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:06,655
This court is now adjourned.

1119
01:34:07,757 --> 01:34:10,817
What? All he gets is a year?

1120
01:34:11,127 --> 01:34:12,526
This ain't happening.

1121
01:34:13,897 --> 01:34:16,525
I should have killed you myself, bitch.

1122
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,864
That's the difference between
you and me.

1123
01:34:20,236 --> 01:34:23,262
Don't get mad, Tito. It's the law.

1124
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:25,137
Sucks, huh?

1125
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:31,477
When this is over with,
you can come and work for me.

1126
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,820
Did you turn state's evidence?

1127
01:34:39,155 --> 01:34:40,850
Did you sell out CMB?

1128
01:34:41,124 --> 01:34:42,455
You pleased with the outcome?

1129
01:34:42,726 --> 01:34:46,218
Absolutely. The American justice system
is the greatest in the world.

1130
01:34:46,563 --> 01:34:48,053
I'm proud to be an American.

1131
01:34:48,331 --> 01:34:50,458
- Hi, Mom.
- Idolater!

1132
01:34:50,734 --> 01:34:53,669
Your soul is required in hell!
