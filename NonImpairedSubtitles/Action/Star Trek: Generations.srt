1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,158
Last time on "Star Trek/
The Next Generation".

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,999
We have to move quickly
to be successful.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,429
- Successful?
- Yes.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,393
In preventing a Klingon civil war.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,078
I would speak with you.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,395
I do not hear the words of traitors.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,511
It was Duras's father

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,679
who betrayed our people to
the Romulans at Khitomer, not mine.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,158
We have discovered that our brother
did indeed have a son and heir.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,158
Follow me,
and I will show you honour.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,317
Your blood
will paint the way to the future.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,352
If we aid the Bortas, we'll drag
the Federation into a civil war.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,554
You both fought as warriors.
I return your family honour.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,275
Mr Worf, your responsibilities
as an officer are incompatible

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,039
with remaining on a Klingon ship
during war.

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,991
Then I resign my commission...

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,752
..as a Starfleet officer.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,552
Picard has rejected
Gowron's plea for help.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,116
The Enterprise has left orbit.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,070
We should not discount
Jean-Luc Picard yet.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,838
He is human.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,634
Humans have a way of showing up
when you least expect them.

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,591
And now, the conclusion.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,917
Maintain course.
Status of warp engines?

25
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,951
Warp engines at 50 percent.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,752
Status of shields?

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,832
Aft shields buckling.

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,480
Transfer auxiliary power to shields!

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,353
Aft shields are gone.

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,354
We cannot win. We must withdraw.

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,630
Keep your place.

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,678
New course!

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,277
307, mark 275.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,675
But that is dangerously close to...

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,110
We are entering the star's corona.

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,879
We will reach the photosphere
in 30 seconds.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,358
Stand by to interwarp on my command.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,234
Set course 250, mark 01 5.

39
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,917
Shields failing! Hull temperature
exceeding design limit.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,353
- Captain!
- Maintain course.

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,069
They are closing on us.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,872
Stand by.

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,953
Captain's log, stardate 45020.4.

44
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,196
We have arrived at Starbase 234.

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,279
I've taken the opportunity to make
a proposal to Admiral Shanthi.

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,392
There have been three engagements
in two weeks,

47
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,637
all won by ships
loyal to the Duras family.

48
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,479
None of which is our concern,
Jean-Luc.

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,592
The Klingon civil war is,
by definition,

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,950
an internal matter of the Empire.

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,438
Agreed. But if the Duras are aided
by the Romulans, it is our concern.

52
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,670
The Romulans have been attempting
to destroy our Alliance for 20 years.

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,634
At the same time, the Duras have
been conspiring with the Romulans.

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,399
Doesn't it seem odd
that the Duras can field

55
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,479
such a force against Gowron
that they outmatch him at every turn?

56
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,477
Some would call it good leadership.

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,751
And some would say
they must be getting help.

58
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,112
The Romulans take enormous risks
for an advantage over the Federation.

59
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,276
Can we seriously believe that now,

60
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,198
with the future of the Empire
in the balance,

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,754
they are content to stand by
and watch?

62
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,473
What is it you propose, Captain?

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,592
We must stop the flow of supplies
and equipment

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,950
to the Duras from the Romulans.

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,078
What I propose is that we send a
fleet to the Romulan-Klingon border.

66
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,236
We'll take no offensive action.

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,559
But we can expose Romulan supplies
that attempt to cross the border.

68
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,069
- A blockade?
- Exactly.

69
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,637
But how would you overcome
the Romulan cloaking device?

70
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,274
My chief engineer
has developed a system

71
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,755
that should nullify that advantage.

72
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,395
Each ship will send out
an active tachyon beam

73
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,431
to the other blockading ships.

74
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,596
In theory, any cloaked vessel

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,032
that attempts to pass between
our ships must cross that beam

76
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,559
and be detected.

77
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,675
I'll have to clear this
with the Federation Council.

78
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,875
In the meantime,
assemble your fleet, Captain.

79
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,319
Nicely done.
I hope we know what we're doing.

80
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,237
So do l, Number One.

81
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,317
Space, the final frontier.

82
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,388
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

83
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,559
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

84
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,156
..to seek out new life
and new civilisations,...

85
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,789
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

86
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,077
Captain's log, stardate 45021.3.

87
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,398
Convincing Starfleet Command
to establish a blockade was painless.

88
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,592
Implementing that plan
is proving more troublesome.

89
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,314
Starfleet is stretched thin
in this quadrant.

90
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,079
There are 1 2 ships
within a day's travel.

91
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,909
The only other ships are in for
repair or under construction.

92
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,156
Most don't have full crews yet.

93
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,794
We could scare up seven, eight ships.

94
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,276
Mr La Forge, can you implement
your grid with 20 ships?

95
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,836
It's possible, but the more ships,
the bigger the net.

96
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,995
Alright.

97
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,033
I want to add the Tian An Men,
the Sutherland and the Hermes,

98
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,230
whether they're ready or not.

99
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,750
Mr Data, select
Enterprise-experienced officers

100
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,792
- to augment the ships' crews.
- Aye, sir.

101
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,434
Will, I want you
to command the Excalibur.

102
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,437
Her crew has been reassigned.

103
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,199
- Geordi, you will be first officer.
- Aye, sir.

104
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,268
I want the fleet under way by 0900.

105
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,833
Thank you, gentlemen.

106
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,118
Yes, Mr Data?

107
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,989
May I ask a question
of a personal nature?

108
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,348
Yes.

109
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,314
I am confused.

110
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,193
Why have I not been assigned
a command?

111
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,598
I felt that you would be needed here.
Why do you ask?

112
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,793
You commented on the lack
of senior officers available.

113
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,515
I believe my 26 years
of service qualifies me.

114
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,517
However, if you do not feel
the time has arrived

115
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,712
for an android to command
a starship, perhaps...

116
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,239
Commander.

117
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,759
I believe the Starship Sutherland
will need a captain.

118
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,713
I can think of no one better suited
than you.

119
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,753
Thank you, sir.

120
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,550
You always did have fools
working for you, Larg.

121
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,075
Now you don't have as many.

122
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,919
You were lucky, Kurn.
But luck runs out.

123
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,190
Someday I'll stand over your corpse

124
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,436
and drink to the victory
of the Duras!

125
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,519
Worf.

126
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,394
Worf, good.
This piece of baktag is Capt Larg.

127
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,513
He commanded the squadron
that tried to destroy us yesterday.

128
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,436
The infamous Worf, son of Mogh.

129
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,235
What is that you are wearing?
The uniform of a Klingon!

130
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,438
The Capital City is neutral ground
and Larg's men are all around us.

131
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,834
As are mine.

132
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,229
Good to drink with you, Kurn.
May you die well.

133
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,159
Die well, Larg.

134
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,630
You drink with our enemies?

135
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,231
How many are Gowron's men?
How many are Duras?

136
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,831
Does it matter? When we meet in
battle, we will fight to the death.

137
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,272
But here, here we're all warriors,
all Klingons.

138
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,790
Repairs to the Hegh'ta
are proceeding. The stabilisers...

139
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,309
Is there nothing in your heart
but duty?

140
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,873
It is my responsibility.

141
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,639
We all have responsibilities
and duties.

142
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,673
But you and I are warriors
fighting in a great war.

143
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,476
Think of it. You and I will fight
battles that others only dream of.

144
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,591
The time for glory is here.

145
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,757
It is not a time
to worry about stabilisers.

146
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,715
It is a time to celebrate.
For tomorrow, we all may die!

147
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,470
Let us, the sons of Mogh, live
this night as if it were our last.

148
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,236
- Worf is not like his brother.
- No.

149
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,592
He tries to be.
But he's still unsure of himself.

150
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,110
He needs something
to help restore his confidence.

151
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,993
I think he'll find our offer
appealing.

152
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,836
I'll make sure he does.

153
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,592
Keep this mixture above 90 percent
or we'll never leave orbit.

154
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,792
Thank you, Mr Krags.

155
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,598
- I am Lt Cmdr Data.
- Lt Cmdr Christopher Hobson.

156
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,673
By order of Starfleet,
I hereby take command.

157
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,314
Please note the time and date
in the log.

158
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,316
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to request a transfer.

159
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,833
May I ask why?

160
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,712
I don't believe I'd be
a good first officer for you.

161
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,832
Your service record
suggests you would be.

162
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,872
No, that's not what I mean.

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,673
I don't think I'd be good for you.

164
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,675
Why?

165
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,438
Frankly, I don't believe
in your ability to command this ship.

166
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,949
You're a fellow officer.
I respect that.

167
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,470
But no one would say that a Klingon
would be a good counsellor,

168
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,513
or that a Berellian could be
an engineer. They're not suited.

169
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,030
By the same token, an android
isn't a good choice to be captain.

170
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,995
I understand your concerns.
Request denied.

171
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,396
The Endeavour has cleared the dock.

172
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,715
- All ships standing by.
- Good.

173
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,276
Course 1 1 8, mark 357.
Full impulse power.

174
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,957
Signal the fleet. We'll enter warp
once we're clear of the system.

175
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,034
Engage.

176
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,233
The Romulan convoy is late.
We need those supplies.

177
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,989
Gowron has suffered another loss
in the Mempa system.

178
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,998
His forces will not threaten you
for some time.

179
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,396
- But if...
- The convoy will arrive soon.

180
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,193
The Federation fleet
has left Starbase 234,

181
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,231
heading for Klingon territory.

182
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,430
- How many?
- At least 20 starships.

183
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,358
- Who is commanding this fleet?
- Picard!

184
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,711
What does it mean?
ls the Federation entering the war?

185
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,432
Should we attack first?

186
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,438
Silence the child or send him away.
Movar.

187
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,229
Return to Romulus immediately.

188
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,875
Have all available ships
at these coordinates in two days.

189
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,718
Yes, Commander.

190
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,274
20 starships
aren't enough to wage war.

191
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,755
Starfleet must be bluffing.

192
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,199
Perhaps.

193
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,349
Our forces in the Mempa sector
are in full retreat.

194
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,392
They will need to regroup
near Beta Lankal.

195
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,229
We destroyed their supply bases
in that sector three weeks ago.

196
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,316
How can they continue to fight?

197
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,271
They must be getting help.

198
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,834
Maybe they have better leaders.

199
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,795
I say you have failed as our leader,
Gowron.

200
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,193
There is no time for this.

201
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,278
We must make plans
before they reach Beta Lankal.

202
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,472
How can we oppose the Duras
if we fight each other?

203
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,512
Gowron must answer this challenge.

204
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,791
Stop! Do we fall upon ourselves
like Ferengi?

205
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,229
The enemy is the Duras.

206
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,873
We are at war!

207
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,709
Now the war... can continue.

208
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,430
We're entering Klingon territory.

209
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,154
Signal the fleet
to maintain yellow alert.

210
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,076
Aye, sir.

211
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,316
Begin scans of the Romulan border.

212
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,630
No uncloaked ships in sensor range.

213
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,990
A few subspace anomalies.

214
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,873
Those anomalies
could be cloaked ships.

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,718
Could be, sir.

216
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,115
Open a channel to the Excalibur.

217
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,071
Excalibur. Riker here.

218
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,954
Deploy the fleet, Will.
It's time to spread our net.

219
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,274
Yes, sir.

220
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,193
We've arrived
at the designated coordinates.

221
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,835
All stop. Notify the flagship
that we have assumed station.

222
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,949
Starboard power coupling
is overloaded.

223
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,152
We've got a radiation leak
on decks ten through 1 2.

224
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,316
The backups are not functioning.

225
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,000
There wasn't enough time
to test them.

226
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,159
Terry, I want you in Engineering
working on a new coupling.

227
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,511
You have taken the phaser
and torpedo units off line.

228
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,200
- Keith, you and l...
- Mr Hobson.

229
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,791
It is inappropriate for you not to
consult your commanding officer.

230
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,556
I was trying to safeguard
the people on those decks.

231
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,196
But you're right.
Belay those orders, everyone.

232
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,993
Phasers and torpedoes
are back on line.

233
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,396
What should we do, sir?

234
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,753
You will take the phaser and torpedo
units off line and begin repairs.

235
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,389
Thank you, sir.
You heard the Captain, everyone.

236
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,672
We're ready, sir.

237
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,794
How long will it take the Romulans
to detect the tachyon field?

238
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,230
Not long. Romulan sensors
are as good as ours.

239
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,352
Very well. Energise the network.

240
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,070
Commander, there's an increase
in tachyon emissions

241
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,838
from the Federation fleet.

242
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,232
They're using the beams
as a detection field.

243
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,433
If we try to cross it,
they'll see us, even cloaked.

244
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,029
Issue orders to begin work
on penetrating this field.

245
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,914
In the meantime, we have to convince
Picard he should leave.

246
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,031
Captain, I'm picking up
something directly ahead.

247
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,991
Romulan ship de-cloaking.

248
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,874
- Shall I raise shields?
- Not yet.

249
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,757
- They're hailing us, sir.
- On screen.

250
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,715
Tasha?

251
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,757
No, Captain. My name is Cmdr Sela.

252
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,038
The woman you knew as Tasha Yar
was my mother.

253
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,718
Deploying an invasion fleet along
our border is an act of aggression.

254
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,512
It will not be tolerated.

255
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,156
You have 20 hours to recall
your ships and return peacefully.

256
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,152
So you believe her?

257
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,159
I'm not saying we should
accept her claim at face value.

258
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,077
But I sensed no deception.

259
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,919
She believes she's the daughter
of Tasha Yar.

260
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,316
No matter what she believes,
Sela can't be her daughter.

261
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,149
Tasha's records give no indication
that she was ever pregnant.

262
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,919
Tasha was a child
when this woman was born.

263
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,192
- Sela could have been cloned.
- Or been surgically altered.

264
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,790
Why? What advantage
could there be to the Romulans?

265
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,388
As this now stands, it won't have
any impact on our strategy.

266
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,990
We'll continue the blockade,
leave the next move to them.

267
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,679
- Am I intruding?
- No, not at all.

268
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,279
Is something wrong?

269
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,552
News travels fast.

270
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,673
I heard that Tasha Yar's daughter
is aboard the Romulan ship.

271
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,433
I think the Romulans are
just hoping to create a distraction.

272
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,516
They want to keep us off balance.

273
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,198
How much do you know about
the last ship called Enterprise?

274
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,633
Enterprise-C? She was lost
in the battle of Narendra Ill,

275
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,877
defending a Klingon
outpost from the Romulans.

276
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,433
And the survivors?

277
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,956
There were stories of prisoners
taken back to Romulus.

278
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,593
But these were rumours.

279
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,272
No. There were survivors.

280
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,470
And Tasha Yar was one of them.

281
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,511
Guinan, that was 23 years ago.
Tasha Yar was only a child.

282
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,638
I know that.
I also know she was aboard that ship.

283
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,955
And she was not a child.

284
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,155
And I think you sent her there.

285
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,913
How can that be?

286
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,036
I don't know.
I just know that you did.

287
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,752
Tasha died.

288
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,913
A year before
you came on the Enterprise.

289
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,429
- You never met her.
- I know that.

290
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,990
If you have only a vague intuition...

291
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,793
You can't just dismiss this.

292
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,630
If I'm right, then you are
responsible for this whole situation.

293
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,872
I think it's time
that I met Cmdr Sela.

294
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,879
We are at war.

295
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,390
Gowron should forbid challenges
until we are victorious.

296
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,432
A Klingon does not postpone
a matter of honour.

297
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,075
A Klingon should place the Empire
above his own pride.

298
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,919
Now Gowron no longer suits you?

299
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,112
Perhaps you wish to challenge him
for leadership?

300
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,390
- No!
- Then do not speak of this!

301
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,715
I did not wish to follow Gowron.

302
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,152
You came to me and insisted
that we support Gowron

303
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,430
against the Duras family.

304
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,755
The time for debate is over.

305
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,958
We are Klingons. He is our leader.
If that is not enough for you,

306
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,631
perhaps you made the wrong choice
when you put on that uniform.

307
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,836
Well, Captain, what is this
urgent matter we need to discuss?

308
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,793
Won't you sit down?

309
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,235
I'm afraid you have
misinterpreted our presence here.

310
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,397
I assure you
that we have no hostile intention.

311
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,356
So then I can tell my superiors

312
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,032
that a fleet of 23 Federation
starships is on our border for what?

313
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,718
Humanitarian reasons?

314
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,398
It is our intent
to prevent any external power

315
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,590
interfering in Klingon affairs.

316
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,553
Nor do we have any plan to do so.

317
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,951
But, if for any reason,
we chose to enter Klingon territory,

318
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,308
how would you stop us?

319
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,159
With our cloaking devices,
we can slip by you.

320
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,829
Then why don't you
just take your ships across?

321
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,719
You sound eager for us to try.

322
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,799
Perhaps you've discovered a method
in detecting our ships?

323
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,392
However, I don't think you want
to discuss our military situation.

324
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,310
Alright. Why did I invite you?

325
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,395
You want the answer
to the only question on your mind.

326
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,431
How could Tasha be my mother?

327
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,955
It's been suggested that she was
on the Enterprise-C 24 years ago,

328
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,469
that she was one of the survivors,

329
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,275
and you're a product of a union
between her and a Romulan.

330
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,353
But you know that's impossible.

331
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,914
She was a child
when that battle occurred.

332
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,033
But you claim it is possible, that
you're the daughter of Tasha Yar.

333
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,393
Yes, she was on that ship
24 years ago.

334
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,071
She was sent there, by you,
from the future.

335
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,760
She was among those few
who survived.

336
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,633
They were to be executed
after interrogation.

337
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,514
But a Romulan general saw her
and became enamoured with her.

338
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,517
So a deal was struck.

339
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,189
Their lives would be spared
if she became his consort.

340
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,191
I was born a year later.

341
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,195
I want to meet your mother.
Can you arrange that?

342
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,677
One night, when I was four,
she came to me.

343
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,588
She bundled me up
and she told me to stay quiet.

344
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,875
I realised she was taking me away,
from my home, my father.

345
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,353
So I cried out.

346
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,271
My father offered her life.
He gave her a home, a child.

347
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,436
And how did she repay him?

348
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,993
By betrayal.

349
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,438
They executed her.

350
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,755
Everything in me that was human
died that day.

351
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,192
All that's left now is Romulan.
Never doubt that.

352
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,355
Doubts? I'm full of them.

353
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,191
But nothing can persuade me
that what you have told me is true.

354
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,276
And I do know one thing.

355
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,790
It will not affect my judgement
at our next encounter.

356
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,714
You have 1 4 hours, Captain.

357
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,035
I suggest you use them wisely.

358
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,759
Is something wrong?

359
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,075
Welcome, Worf, son of Mogh.

360
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,789
- What do you want?
- The same as you.

361
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,798
Personal honour.
Glory for the Empire.

362
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,275
Your family has never valued honour.

363
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,277
You only knew our brother.
We are not like him.

364
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,039
Our brother made many mistakes.

365
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,799
One was to make you an enemy.

366
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,911
We would rather be your friend.

367
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,235
Then you should not oppose Gowron.

368
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,032
Gowron is nothing!

369
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,228
Toral is Duras's only son.

370
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,716
And he will be the leader
of the Council.

371
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,956
In your heart, even you know that.

372
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,959
- But Toral needs guidance.
- A firm hand.

373
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,548
A father figure.

374
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,754
That could be you,
if you were mated to B'Etor.

375
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,792
The rewards could be greater
than you can imagine.

376
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,116
Nothing will stand in our way.

377
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,118
We could rule the Empire together.

378
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,358
Join us.
Usher in a new era for our people.

379
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,074
An era where honour has no meaning?

380
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,078
Where Klingons trade loyalties
in dark rooms?

381
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,919
And the Empire is ruled from Romulus?

382
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,914
Enough, Lursa. You failed.

383
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,998
I need to know the strength
of the Federation fleet.

384
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,078
I don't have time for this.
Turn him over to the guard.

385
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,760
B'Etor can have him
when they're finished.

386
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,029
Come!

387
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,957
In 1 3 hours, we'll be forced to
withdraw or fight the Romulans.

388
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,640
Neither alternative is acceptable.

389
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,911
We must expose their involvement
before the deadline.

390
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,758
What is it you propose?

391
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,314
If you launch an attack now,

392
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,273
then the Duras fleet
will call for supplies.

393
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,675
Lursa and B'Etor will call for help.

394
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,349
The Romulans will try to run
the blockade. We'll be ready.

395
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,911
Once the Romulan connection
has been exposed,...

396
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,199
..support will fall away
from Lursa and B'Etor. Very well.

397
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,276
I will make preparations.

398
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,071
One thing more, Picard.

399
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,398
Worfhas been captured by the Duras.

400
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,111
I hope he dies well.

401
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,599
Qapla'!

402
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,154
When Gowron attacks,
we will make our move.

403
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,078
Excalibur will fall back
with engine problems.

404
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,839
You take the Akagi
and the Hornet here

405
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,155
to open a gap in our detection net.

406
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,034
If the Romulans know of the field,
they'll run the blockade.

407
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,878
Exactly. But when they do,

408
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,310
the Enterprise and the Tian An Men
will swing around,

409
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,035
close the gap
and catch them in the act.

410
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,239
Very nice.

411
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,998
I'd better get back.

412
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,559
- Good luck, Will.
- Good luck, Captain.

413
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,392
We've received a message
from Lursa and B'Etor.

414
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,318
Gowron's forces attacked
in three sectors.

415
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,829
The Duras are nearing defeat.

416
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,033
You mean they were caught unprepared
and they're crying for help.

417
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,675
Have the science sections found
a way to circumvent the grid?

418
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,199
We think so.

419
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,309
Just before we cross,
we send out a massive tachyon pulse.

420
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,150
A burst that large should disable
a part of their network.

421
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,474
Good.

422
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,632
One of their ships
is moving off the blockade.

423
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,398
Their warp drive is failing.

424
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,354
Picard is redeploying the fleet
to compensate for the missing ship.

425
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,833
- There's a gap in the net.
- He doesn't have enough ships.

426
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,952
If we act quickly,
we can move through.

427
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,475
- Commander!
- No.

428
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,998
- I don't think so.
- It's what we've waited for.

429
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,270
I know. And so does Picard.

430
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,076
He's giving us what we need.
He expects us to take it.

431
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,112
No. We won't step into Picard's trap.

432
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,155
We will disable part of his network
here, where they're weakest.

433
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,912
We'll direct the energy burst at
the ship with the android captain.

434
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,469
Sir, the net is picking up activity
from the Romulans.

435
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,717
1 5 cloaked ships
spreading out along the border.

436
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,638
- Signal the fleet to stand by.
- Aye, sir.

437
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,915
Now!

438
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,914
Come to course 080, mark 295.

439
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,032
There's a disruption
in the tachyon detectors.

440
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,119
It's localised to this segment
of the net.

441
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,716
Open a channel to the Sutherland.

442
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,034
Data here, sir.

443
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,197
We're reading a disruption
of the net in your area.

444
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,914
The Romulans released
a high-energy burst.

445
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,192
The net is no longer effective
in radius of 10 million kilometres.

446
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,155
That's where they're going through.
Send a signal.

447
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,068
All ships to Gamma Eridon.
We'll re-establish the net there.

448
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,428
Aye, sir.

449
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,074
All Federation ships proceed
at maximum warp to Gamma Eridon.

450
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,318
Acknowledge the signal.
Ensign, engage at warp 9.3.

451
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,793
Aye, sir.

452
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,759
What are you doing?

453
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,713
In disrupting the net,
the Romulans may have caused

454
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,638
a tachyon signature
around their own ships.

455
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,558
- But we have no way of detecting it.
- All stop.

456
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,318
Aye, sir. All stop.

457
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,875
Sir! The fleet's been ordered
to Gamma Eridon.

458
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,514
The tachyon signatures
will not last long.

459
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,234
By the time we deploy,
it will be too late.

460
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,670
Reconfigure the sensors
to detect ionised particles.

461
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,678
The area's been flooded
with tachyon particles!

462
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,030
We'll never find
what we're looking for.

463
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,516
I am aware of the difficulties.
Bring the phasers on line.

464
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,154
That will flood three decks
with radiation!

465
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,919
We will initiate radiation protocol.

466
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,828
You don't give a damn about people's
lives! We're not machines!

467
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,670
Mr Hobson! You will carry out
my orders or I will relieve you.

468
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,434
Yes, sir.

469
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,788
The Sutherland isn't heading
for the rendezvous point.

470
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,115
She's come to a full stop.

471
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,719
Open a channel.

472
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,550
The Enterprise wants to know
the reason we've stopped.

473
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,318
Display sensor schematic.

474
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,595
Display sensor sweep, maximum range.

475
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,309
Are you going to answer
the Enterprise?

476
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,513
Open a display
with tachyon emissions.

477
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,631
Highlight any tachyon signatures
which show inertial displacement.

478
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,875
Concentrate a sensor sweep
in that area.

479
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,390
This is pointless.
Those readings could be anything.

480
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,557
There's no way to be sure
the Romulans are there.

481
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,194
Reconfigure photon torpedo
warhead yields.

482
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,390
Set for high-energy burst level six.

483
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,114
- Level six? But that won't even...
- Do it!

484
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,432
Torpedoes ready.

485
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,072
Another message coming in.
It's Capt Picard.

486
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,678
Mr Data, you were ordered
to rendezvous at Gamma Eridon.

487
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,869
Acknowledge.

488
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,833
Stand by, Captain.
Mr Hobson, prepare to fire.

489
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,032
- Didn't you hear Capt Picard?
- Fire.

490
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,834
Fire!

491
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,558
They have discovered us.

492
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,110
Reverse course. Order the fleet back
to Romulan territory.

493
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,518
The Duras need this convoy!
Without supplies, they cannot win.

494
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,710
We've been discovered. It's over.

495
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,559
What should I tell Lursa and B'Etor?

496
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,878
Tell them... they're on their own.

497
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,713
They're changing course,
heading back to Romulan space.

498
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,431
Make a report to the flagship.

499
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,031
Take the phasers off line
and begin a radiation clean-up.

500
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,388
Yes, sir.

501
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,113
Captain.

502
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,553
- Defeat!
- How? Where are the Romulans?

503
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,193
They never came!

504
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,039
Kill him!

505
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,675
No!

506
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,995
Toral, the next leader of the Empire.

507
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,151
Gowron is looking forward
to seeing you again.

508
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,319
Captain's personal log,
stardate 45025.4.

509
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,237
With profound relief,

510
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,670
I have ordered the fleet
back to Federation territory

511
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,839
following the Romulan withdrawal
and the news of Gowron's victory.

512
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,474
We have arrived
at the Klingon Homeworld,

513
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,355
where I will present the High Council
a full report on our encounter.

514
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,190
Come.

515
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,994
Captain, I wish to submit myself
for disciplinary action.

516
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,953
I disobeyed an order
from a superior officer.

517
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,117
Although the result of my actions
proved positive,

518
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,356
the ends cannot justify the means.

519
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,958
No, they can't.

520
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,233
However, the claim,
"I was only following orders,"

521
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,433
has been used to justify
too many tragedies in our history.

522
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,030
Starfleet doesn't want officers
who blindly follow orders

523
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,230
without analysing the situation.

524
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,352
Your actions were appropriate
for the circumstances.

525
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,789
I have noted that in your record.

526
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,074
Mr Data.

527
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,233
Nicely done.

528
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,673
Sir.

529
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,831
The Council appreciates
your report, Captain.

530
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,478
The information
on the Romulan supply ships

531
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,397
will prove very useful.

532
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,077
Before you leave...

533
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,189
..there is one last matter
to attend to.

534
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,193
Bring him.

535
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,800
Toral, son of Duras.

536
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,554
You stand convicted of treason.

537
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,436
The Duras family
will one day rule the Empire!

538
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,357
Perhaps.

539
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,078
But not today.

540
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,755
Worf.

541
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,476
This child's family
wrongly took your name...

542
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,355
..and your honour from you.

543
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,472
In return,...

544
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,508
..l give his life to you.

545
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,116
What's wrong?

546
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,753
Kill him!

547
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,194
No.

548
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,676
But it's our way.
It's the Klingon way.

549
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,678
I know.

550
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,156
But it is not my way.

551
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,352
This boy has done me no harm.

552
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,914
I will not kill him
for the crimes of his family.

553
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,439
It falls to Kurn.

554
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,158
No.

555
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,989
No, you gave me his life.
I have spared it.

556
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,518
As you wish.

557
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,839
Request permission
to return to duty, sir.

558
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,714
Granted.
