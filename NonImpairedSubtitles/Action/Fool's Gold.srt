1
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,130
You fuck, you broke it.

2
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:22,410
What the hell was that?

3
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:24,068
What was what?

4
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:27,114
I'm referring to the enormous
underwater explosion.

5
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,414
- Alfonz?
- What?

6
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,614
Do you have any idea what this is?

7
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:39,319
I would guess it is a piece of a plate
from Howard Johnson's.

8
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,929
Do you have any idea what this is, buddy?

9
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,258
This is it.

10
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:46,561
This is it, man, this is what
I've been looking for for eight years.

11
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:48,431
Eight years.

12
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:50,531
Huh?

13
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,198
Oh, good God. Oh, thank you.

14
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,277
Oh, baby, I knew you were here.
Oh, yes, you are.

15
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,507
Where's the boat?

16
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,876
- Where's the boat?
- I don't know.

17
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:04,180
What, did somebody just take it?

18
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:11,617
I found it.

19
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,527
- What do you mean? Where is it?
- It will come to you.

20
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,566
Oh, no.

21
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,209
For some reason,
I'm not entirely surprised.

22
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:29,402
Oh, no.

23
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:05,410
- Hey, guys.
- Get in.

24
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:09,847
- You wanna know where the boat went.
- It took us a minute to figure it out too.

25
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,749
- You sunk it.
- Listen, Curtis, forget the boat.

26
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,288
We found something.
I mean, we found something.

27
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,258
Bigg Bunny spent some major bank
on that leaky-ass piece of shit.

28
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:20,521
How come it sunk?

29
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:22,926
Look, boats sink.
I mean, nobody knows why.

30
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,396
Can I show you what I found?

31
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,694
- I think it was the compressor.
- Don't help me.

32
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,804
I want them to know it was you
who stole their money.

33
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,564
You didn't buy a new compressor?

34
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:35,476
- It's okay if I take off now?
- Yeah, man, we don't care about you.

35
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,046
Oh, you disloyal Ukrainian prick.

36
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:47,716
Ho! Ho! Ho! Easy.

37
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,085
Get in the damn boat.

38
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:00,231
Oh...

39
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:14,106
Oh...

40
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,320
What perfect hair.

41
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:20,513
What a perfect hairstyle.

42
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,990
Oh, my God, what perfect nails.
Where did you get them done?

43
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:29,393
You did them yourself? Oh, my God.

44
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:32,432
They're so incredibly perfect.

45
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:37,471
Like your incredibly perfect face,
and your...

46
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,838
...perfect personality.

47
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:44,705
Ugh. Ooh.

48
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,746
That's nice.

49
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,251
Lillian, I've called Teddy and Purdy...

50
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:58,621
...and they're not going to tell
their editors...

51
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:00,853
...not to publish stories about her.

52
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,498
It's how they make a living. Anyway...

53
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,294
...what about the other half-dozen
bloody magazines...

54
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:08,460
...she's always appearing in
half-clothed...

55
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:11,129
...and halfway on her way
to the bloody halfway house?

56
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:12,399
Crush them too?

57
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,635
No, no, no, I assure you
that as soon as Gemma arrives...

58
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:19,406
...I have every intention of giving her
a very firm talking-to, and I...

59
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,974
Hello? Oh...

60
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:27,145
My ex-wife.

61
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,186
Yes, sir.

62
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,595
Was there something else, uh?

63
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,866
- Tess.
- I'm sorry. Tess, yes.

64
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,400
No, sir.

65
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,336
I just wanted to tell you how much
I appreciate you accommodating me.

66
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:46,907
How did I do that?

67
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,235
You know, by agreeing to stop
in Key West for my thing tomorrow.

68
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,342
Your thing?

69
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:57,186
Oh, yes, I remember.
Married, are you getting?

70
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:59,913
Oh, no.

71
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:01,848
Divorced.

72
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,659
Oh.

73
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:05,951
Your idea?

74
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,595
Yeah.

75
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:10,031
I don't mean to pry, just...

76
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,101
That's all right.
I'll tell you all about it sometime.

77
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,728
If you like.

78
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:20,799
Anyway, thanks again.

79
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,272
You're welcome.

80
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:36,754
I authorized $62,581.43 to fix that boat.

81
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:42,120
So where my money at?

82
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:44,926
Oh, God, I don't know, um...
It's all over.

83
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:46,295
All over where?

84
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,832
The world.

85
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,131
All over the world?

86
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,937
The Caribbean, mainly.

87
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,769
Hell, I was pretty much blown out...

88
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:56,639
...at just about every dive supplier
south of Key West.

89
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,705
- I don't believe this guy.
- Look.

90
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:01,509
I used the money
to pay off some old debts...

91
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,482
...which, if anything,
should reassure you.

92
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:09,054
Because now I owe you money,
and you know that I'm good for it.

93
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,191
Huh?

94
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,596
Now, can we talk about the plate?

95
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:18,828
Come on.

96
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,301
A plate from Howard Johnson's.

97
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:30,536
It is not a plate
from Howard Johnson's, man.

98
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,807
That's got half the Vangor family crest
stamped on the back of it.

99
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:36,247
And if you just let me get back
down to my boat...

100
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,683
...all right, before my books rot,
I'll prove it.

101
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:41,322
Shit look more to me
like half a Arby's logo or something.

102
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:47,091
Look at the filigree scalloping on the rim.

103
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,893
Do you understand what this means?

104
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:57,568
Get his embezzling ass off my island.

105
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,946
Fine.

106
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,012
Can I have my shard back?

107
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,880
You ain't gonna need it.

108
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:13,921
So you do know what it means.

109
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,858
No, no, no, get...

110
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:22,520
You guys are making a big mistake.

111
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:27,032
<i>Bigg Bunny is never gonna find
the Aurelia without me.</i>

112
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:32,897
You ever hear the expression,
"miss by an inch, miss by a mile"?

113
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:35,774
It's a diving expression.

114
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,778
It means, you miss by an inch,
you miss by a mile.

115
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:43,345
Now, that wreck could be scattered
over 20 miles, guys.

116
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:46,320
Any last words?

117
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,062
Yeah.

118
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,691
Tell Tess I love her.

119
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:01,530
Okay.

120
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:03,529
Who's Tess?

121
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,835
It's my wife.

122
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:10,468
At least she will be
till 10:00 tomorrow morning.

123
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,243
She's divorcing me...

124
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:17,482
...and I still don't know what I did wrong.

125
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,953
Well, brother, you ain't never
gonna find out, neither.

126
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,754
- Let's go.
- Curtis, hold it, help.

127
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,659
Help. Help!

128
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,091
Oh, shit.

129
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,967
Hey.

130
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:44,780
Hey. Don't move.

131
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,491
Oh, shit.

132
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,063
Whoa. Whoa.

133
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,172
Get him.

134
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:18,211
Use the boat. Start the engine.

135
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,851
Oh, shit!

136
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,384
Whoo!

137
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,888
Shit.

138
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:57,645
Shit.

139
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:35,252
Please, Lord,
don't let me shoot off my foot.

140
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:14,558
Okay, guys...

141
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,290
...wish me luck.

142
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:19,662
Good luck, honey.
Don't lose your nerve at the last minute.

143
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,134
She don't need her nerve,
10-to-1 the guy don't even show up.

144
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:27,071
- Why do you say that?
- Because that's his nature.

145
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:29,301
- What the hell do you know?
- That's right.

146
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:32,106
Defend that bastard
and attack your friends who love you.

147
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,441
I've got no feelings.

148
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,312
I'm just saying you don't know
anything about my marriage.

149
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,885
- Well, I heard enough.
- Hmm.

150
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:41,318
Do I comment on your love life?

151
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,483
You could, if I didn't happen to be
the most fortunate guy in the world.

152
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:47,252
Get out of here.

153
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:51,627
I just want you to have the happiness
me and Eddie thank God for every day.

154
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,098
He's not exaggerating, either.
We really do that.

155
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:56,794
Apparently this makes me
some kind of deranged animal.

156
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:59,532
You make it sound
like I never meant anything to him.

157
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:04,044
All I said was the guy has a tendency
to miss a lot of appointments.

158
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,877
Behold this dude.

159
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,603
What's up?

160
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,374
Oh, my God, are you from Cuba?

161
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,951
Lucky for you we happened along,
my most superfluously toasted friend.

162
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,485
Water, water.

163
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:23,250
It appears that you have run dry
of the sacred nectar.

164
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:24,517
Oh, yeah.

165
00:17:27,362 --> 00:17:28,852
Yeah.

166
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:34,094
All hail Neptune,
and those who party on his mighty waves.

167
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,635
- Hail, Neptune. Whoo!
- Hail, Neptune. Whoo!

168
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,104
Decent rescue.

169
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,078
Holy shit.

170
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,424
Go faster. Whoo!

171
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:02,987
Take a left right here.

172
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:13,373
I'll give him a few more minutes,
Mr. McCintry...

173
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:17,310
...but if he's not here by a quarter past...

174
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:22,712
...I'll be forced to award everything
to Mrs. Finnegan here...

175
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:24,250
...by default.

176
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,082
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Do you wanna go to prison?

177
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:30,784
If it gets me out of Florida?

178
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:34,551
Honey, Florida didn't ruin your life.
You did.

179
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,258
You married a guy for the sex,
and then expected him to be smart.

180
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:44,702
Aah.

181
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:46,934
Maybe he had car trouble.

182
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,104
Car trouble?

183
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:50,711
<i>Yeah. You know...</i>

184
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,138
...car trouble.

185
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,610
He'd have to own a car...

186
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,682
...which he couldn't even if he wanted to
because he has no money.

187
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,655
<i>He has no credit.</i>

188
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:07,352
He has no clue how to behave
like a responsible adult.

189
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:08,987
Oh...

190
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:15,660
Which is why I can't get a loan,
because everything is in our name. Ha-ha.

191
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:20,335
I can't even pay for school
and finish my degree...

192
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,875
...which is what I was doing
in the first place...

193
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,445
...before I got dragged down here
on spring break.

194
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:30,811
But like you said, the sex was really...

195
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,254
...really, really great.

196
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:39,688
Do you have any idea
how humiliating it is...

197
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,762
...to get divorced by yourself?

198
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:57,812
Your Honor, this is a big mistake.

199
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,709
This woman...

200
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,115
...and I still love each other.

201
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:06,449
Don't do this, Tess.

202
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,852
Look, I know I messed up, all right?

203
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:12,050
But I'm willing to change in any area
that you feel needs work.

204
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:13,660
I wanna make you happy.

205
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,927
I'll do anything.

206
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,562
I'll see a counselor.

207
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:27,566
Will you come to Chicago with me
like you promised?

208
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:31,741
Could be... I mean, that could work.

209
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:35,478
I'll definitely see the counselor.

210
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:41,655
Mr. Finnegan...

211
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:45,892
...I can't tell you what a pleasure it is
to inform you that under Florida law...

212
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:50,397
...you and this woman have been divorced
for the last 50 or 60 seconds.

213
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:54,558
Moreover, as you were not present
at the time of the proceedings...

214
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:57,330
...she got everything.

215
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:04,238
We're divorced?

216
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,480
I'm afraid so.

217
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:17,422
Why?

218
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:22,986
Excuse me.

219
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,775
Oh, wait, Tess.
I gotta tell you what happened.

220
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,969
Tess.

221
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,571
We found it. Me and Alfonz.

222
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:44,981
About a hundred yards off the reef.
Right where we always said she'd be.

223
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,818
Oh...

224
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:50,818
Prove it.

225
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:58,228
Excuse me, excuse me,
you have a pen, paper?

226
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,663
Anybody got a pen, pencil,
paper, anything?

227
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:04,135
Your uselessness is epic.

228
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:07,537
What does that mean? Here we go.

229
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:12,010
All right. Alfonz and I are diving...

230
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:16,751
...and I come across this plate,
dinner plate, about yay big.

231
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,886
It's plain white...

232
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,453
...but this...

233
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,551
...was stamped on the back...

234
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,257
...in blue.

235
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:30,260
It's the Vangor family crest, Tess.

236
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,765
You were right all along.
You were right before anybody.

237
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,539
- Where did you find this?
- A hundred yards off the reef.

238
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:43,100
Wow, Finn. Oh, my God.

239
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,109
That's what I'm saying.

240
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,275
Where's the plate?

241
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:50,742
Well, I don't have it on me
this minute.

242
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:52,277
Where do you have it?

243
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,388
Well, it's back there.

244
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:58,686
Wow.

245
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:01,386
Wow.

246
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:05,260
I know what you're thinking, Tess.
But I swear to God it's the truth.

247
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:06,458
You can ask Alfonz.

248
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,626
Okay. Where is he?

249
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,066
Well, he's back there too.

250
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:12,832
I can't believe you would dangle this
in front of me.

251
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:15,067
I can't believe it.

252
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:18,542
- You really think I'd lie about this?
- Why not? You're a liar.

253
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,045
But this is an inappropriate time
to dwell on that.

254
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:23,184
You... I can draw this picture too.

255
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:26,912
Hey, Tess, I'm telling you, we solved
a 300-year-old mystery yesterday.

256
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:28,249
Married or not...

257
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:32,018
...if we don't go after that ship,
it's gonna haunt us the rest of our lives.

258
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,526
I wasted eight years of my life
on this bullshit.

259
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:37,358
I'm going back to Chicago.
I'm gonna get my Ph. D...

260
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:41,332
...and I'm going to spend the rest of my life
teaching, reading and writing books.

261
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,768
And somewhere in there I'm gonna meet
an intelligent, successful man...

262
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,877
...who can get through an entire
conversation without using "definitely. "

263
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:55,874
First of all,
I hardly ever say that anymore.

264
00:23:56,451 --> 00:24:00,410
And when are you gonna stop selling
this crap about going back to school?

265
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:03,922
You want history?
It's under the ocean, lady.

266
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:08,392
What, are you telling me you wanna
spend your life in some dark room...

267
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:10,963
...taking notes and writing books...

268
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:14,296
...about what some old putz in
another room cooked up in his head...

269
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:16,903
...about things
that you have actually seen...

270
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:20,838
...and touched and pulled out of the sand
with your own hands?

271
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:25,742
Bullshit.

272
00:24:28,283 --> 00:24:30,979
I'm so glad we're not married anymore.

273
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,492
Well, where are you gonna get
the tuition money anyway?

274
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:43,825
That's the best part. By selling the boat.

275
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,064
By selling my boat, which belongs to me,
which used to belong to us...

276
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,704
...but you missed the divorce
so now it belongs to me.

277
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:54,333
I'm gonna fix it up, I'm gonna sell it,
and I'm going back... What?

278
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:55,635
This is hard to say.

279
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,437
What is?

280
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:17,922
Well, you act like this is totally my fault.

281
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:21,597
Can I borrow this cane
for a second, please?

282
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,499
Oh, come on, Tess.
You're not gonna hit me.

283
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:24,934
Ugh.

284
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:30,370
Sorry.

285
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,509
Oh, my God.

286
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:07,875
Oh, my God.

287
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:10,516
Oh, God.

288
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,605
I take it they didn't kill you.

289
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,985
No...

290
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:49,284
...but thanks for your help.

291
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:52,324
- You need help.
- You are not my mother.

292
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:53,518
You're right.

293
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,131
I guess maybe I act like your mother
sometimes because I never had one.

294
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,357
Easy, Gary, easy.

295
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,468
Okay, look, the main thing is
we get away from Key West.

296
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:05,470
The second Finn lays eyes on this boat,
he's gonna be onboard in 10 minutes.

297
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,074
What do you mean?
You told him you're working here?

298
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:10,473
- Are you kidding?
- Then I don't get it.

299
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,139
He needs money, Gary.

300
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:16,283
Another boat, new equipment, everything.

301
00:27:16,451 --> 00:27:19,682
And I doubt he's gonna squeeze
another dime out of that Bugs Bunny.

302
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:23,051
- Bugs Bunny?
- The rapper guy we had the fight about.

303
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,021
- You mean Bigg Bunny Deenz?
- Yeah.

304
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:27,991
- Bigg Bunny Deenz is Finn's investor?
- Yeah.

305
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:31,257
- Hey, Gary?
- He is a very dangerous guy.

306
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:33,799
I did like that one song he had,
"Call Me Thumper. "

307
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:35,162
That was some funny shit.

308
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:37,635
- Anyway...
- There's something wrong with my bisque.

309
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:39,205
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Anyway...

310
00:27:39,374 --> 00:27:42,104
But I don't get it,
because has Finn ever even met Nigel?

311
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:44,939
No. But he will, don't you understand?

312
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:47,809
He is a genius at exactly three things:

313
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:53,420
Treasure salving, finding money
for treasure salving, and one other thing.

314
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,324
- What other thing?
- What other thing?

315
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,721
I don't wanna talk about it.

316
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:03,022
How do you plan to get another boat?

317
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:06,463
I can't think about this right now, Alfonz.

318
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,068
I just got divorced.

319
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:12,433
May I make a suggestion?

320
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:14,974
No.

321
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,709
You see that big yacht lying offshore?

322
00:28:19,347 --> 00:28:20,371
No, which one?

323
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:23,381
The owner is Nigel Honeycutt.

324
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:26,278
- So what?
- I only mention it...

325
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:31,790
...because he is worth $ 700 million.

326
00:28:33,928 --> 00:28:37,625
And just to let you know,
I'm back onboard, obviously.

327
00:28:38,032 --> 00:28:40,592
So whenever you want to weigh anchor
is great.

328
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:42,836
Thank you.

329
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:45,370
So should I tell the captain?

330
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,667
Ready to weigh anchor?
Ready to push off?

331
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:50,506
Actually, no.

332
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:53,806
My daughter, Gemma, is joining us today...

333
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,973
...and I said I would wait here for her.

334
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,619
Oh, great. God.

335
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:01,614
When is she coming?
Where is she coming from?

336
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,815
How far away is she? How great.

337
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:06,386
I sent the chopper to Miami...

338
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:09,496
...but she could be anywhere.

339
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:13,156
That's so funny that you would wait
in Key West for her...

340
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,064
...when she's coming by chopper.

341
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,296
- Is it?
- Well, just because the helicopter...

342
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:20,202
...could just meet the boat anywhere.

343
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:24,607
I mean, anywhere at all, that's what's
so incredibly great about helicopters.

344
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:28,138
She wants to do some shopping.

345
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,446
What do you do, Tess?

346
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,026
I'm the new steward.

347
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,027
But what do you really do?

348
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,465
What makes you think I do anything
besides stewarding?

349
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:52,834
Stewing, stewarding,
stewarding? Stewarding.

350
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:57,706
My infallible lifelong instinct
for sizing people up.

351
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,813
Have you sized me up?

352
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:04,576
Not quite.

353
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:10,318
You don't mind the work,
but you're not here for long.

354
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:15,990
You have a deep but not entirely unclouded
love for the sea.

355
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:20,126
You perform your duties
with superlative efficiency and ease...

356
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:23,099
...suggestive of someone expending
approximately one-tenth...

357
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:25,136
...of her available brain power.

358
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:27,874
So...

359
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:31,440
...what do you do
with the remaining 90 percent...

360
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:33,547
...when you're not getting divorced?

361
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,381
I hope I'm not being too personal.

362
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:46,057
No, not at... Not at all.

363
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:53,358
It's just been a crazy couple of years.

364
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:58,871
It's probably his helicopter.

365
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,167
His daughter
is supposed to be arriving today.

366
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:04,072
The whole town is buzzing
with excitement.

367
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:26,431
Hey, so where you say
this, uh, museum is at?

368
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:30,332
Number 2, Water Street.

369
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:34,032
Okay, uh, every street on this island
is called Water Street.

370
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,938
This place has a magic atmosphere.

371
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:39,079
Will you just find
the damn address, man?

372
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:41,772
Yo, Cordell, we got MapQuest
on these things?

373
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,324
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, darling.

374
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,830
Hello, my baby.

375
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:32,694
Daddy.

376
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:40,870
- Pleasant flight?
- Uh-huh.

377
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:44,810
So, um, is this the whole boat?

378
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:50,210
- Yes.
- Oh, so cute.

379
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,717
I can't believe we're at sea.

380
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,050
Well, uh, technically, we're at anchor.

381
00:32:56,224 --> 00:33:02,163
Oh, wait, okay. So that just means
that the anchor is in the water, right?

382
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,361
- Yes.
- Yes.

383
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:07,933
Okay. Because I totally wanna learn
all the sea terms.

384
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:09,933
And so you shall, my darling.

385
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:13,335
Okay, let me try again.
Excuse me, Nigel.

386
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:15,874
Yes, my dear.

387
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,603
You know what,
let's not do the accent thing.

388
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:20,337
It's no good?

389
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,813
It's fine.

390
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,212
Um... Anyway...

391
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:31,222
Nigel, remember when you asked me
this afternoon what I really did?

392
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,903
Have fun shopping.

393
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:48,702
Thank you, Daddy.

394
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:51,344
Do try to keep it
under 50 thousand.

395
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,170
What? Ha.

396
00:33:54,982 --> 00:33:56,176
Supper's at 7.

397
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:00,047
I was supposed to meet some friends,
but I'm gonna try to get out of it.

398
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:02,485
Invite them aboard if you like.
Just let me know.

399
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:04,682
Okay, I will. Love you.

400
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:25,376
My hat.

401
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,555
Hey, look. The hat, he is a Frisbee.

402
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:38,885
Can you turn the boat around?
Thank you.

403
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,688
Okay, but we never gonna catch him.

404
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:07,284
Whoa!

405
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,482
God.

406
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,097
- Oh, shit.
- Oh.

407
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,128
Oh, my God. You killed him.

408
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,165
Ow. Ow. Ow.

409
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:31,971
What in God's name happened?

410
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,606
Daddy, this man saved my life.

411
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:37,444
Sir, sir...

412
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,979
...I really don't think you should get up
until I make sure...

413
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:53,159
Is this your hat?

414
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:54,995
Yes. Ha-ha.

415
00:35:56,204 --> 00:36:01,801
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

416
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:07,645
Sir, thank you so much.

417
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:08,839
Thank you.

418
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:10,711
- Thank you, indeed.
- He'll be okay.

419
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,785
Just a little bump on the head.

420
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:16,515
Just try not to move around too much
for the next few hours.

421
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:21,355
- But I gotta go back to town.
- Oh, I really don't advise it.

422
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:22,923
Oh...

423
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:24,461
Now what am I gonna do?

424
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,425
Uh...

425
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,833
May I suggest a hot shower,
some clean clothes...

426
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:32,302
...and cocktails at 6:30?

427
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:36,070
Okay. Thanks.

428
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:39,745
Take him to the Saint Regis.

429
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:46,009
Whoa, whoa.
Yep, yep, yep, I'm good. I'm good.

430
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:48,913
Hey, Mr. Honeycutt?

431
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,753
Miss Honeycutt,
she leave him on the boat.

432
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:56,556
Gemma. Your lifeline
to civilization, darling.

433
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:00,791
Oh.

434
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:04,003
Oh, my God, I would have been so dead.

435
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:06,139
Here you are, darling.

436
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:18,274
Well, Mr. Deenz, I'm always delighted
to welcome an entrant into my field...

437
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:20,784
...whether it be on land or sea.

438
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:24,119
But I feel I need to warn you.

439
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:26,552
There's no way
of getting away from treasure...

440
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:29,389
...once it's fastened itself on your mind.

441
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:32,054
I want you to find me the Queen's Dowry.

442
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:33,564
Heh.

443
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:37,602
- Well, now, Bunny, uh...
- Bigg Bunny. It's one word.

444
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:42,735
Well, that's an emerald
of a different color, isn't it?

445
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:45,038
Cordell.

446
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:55,517
This is a piece of the plate
that we found in the Bahamas...

447
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,490
...off of Topsail Cay.
Now, if you turn it over...

448
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,118
...you may notice that it has
the Vangor family crest stamped on it.

449
00:38:03,297 --> 00:38:05,231
That's what that is right there.

450
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,230
That's very nice, uh...

451
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:12,264
...but who the hell are the Vangors...

452
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,274
...and why the hell should I give
a rat's ass about their family crest?

453
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:25,115
It's not an investment, per se,
because you probably won't see a dime...

454
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:28,084
...but it's a chance to pull out
a piece of living history...

455
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:31,088
...from the sand
with your own two hands.

456
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:35,522
<i>To the Aurelia.</i>

457
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,467
Hey, babe.

458
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:42,396
What are you doing here?

459
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,162
Have a good dinner.

460
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:47,765
<i>Bon appétit, everybody.</i>

461
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:50,000
Ugh!

462
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:56,444
I take it you've met.

463
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:02,048
So Tess and I first hooked up when
we worked for this cat named Moe Fitch.

464
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:05,989
He's kind of a local character, you know,
big talker, lot of tall tales...

465
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,559
...a lovable, old sea dog.

466
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:11,391
- You should live to be so eccentric.
- Ooh...

467
00:39:11,565 --> 00:39:12,964
Thank you, babe.

468
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:15,034
I do wish you would sit down.

469
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:19,299
Moe Fitch is the most respected and
successful treasure salvor in the world.

470
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:21,532
- Nobody said he wasn't.
- When Finn met Moe...

471
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,904
...he was repairing outboards
and lawn mowers...

472
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:26,546
...during the brief intervals
he wasn't getting fired.

473
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:28,614
Two times, Tess. I got fired two times.

474
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,648
I'll be off in one second.

475
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:34,020
Moe picked him out of a puddle
of motor oil and suntan lotion...

476
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:38,420
...gave him a job, a vocation,
taught him everything he knows.

477
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:42,289
Almost.

478
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:47,234
Anyway, then they had a tremendous
falling-out over this cannon we found...

479
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:49,164
On our day off.

480
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:52,430
<i>From the Aurelia,
three miles east of Vero Beach.</i>

481
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:56,133
Which the court ruled was Moe's,
because we borrowed his equipment.

482
00:39:57,912 --> 00:40:00,380
The sea is all attached, right?

483
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:02,545
To what, darling?

484
00:40:02,716 --> 00:40:05,276
Kerry and Vivante
grabbed a plane for the Yucatân...

485
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:07,683
...and I thought
we could hook up with them...

486
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:10,722
...instead of just sailing around
doing nothing.

487
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,761
Tell us about the treasure.

488
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:24,694
July 31 st, 1715.

489
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:28,638
A hurricane sinks the entire Spanish
treasure fleet off the coast of Florida...

490
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:31,300
<i>...including her flagship, the Capitana...</i>

491
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:35,575
...which, according to its manifest,
carried the Queen's Dowry.

492
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:39,116
Forty chests
of jewelry and gold crowns...

493
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:42,312
...especially crafted in the Orient
for the new queen of Spain.

494
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,958
When we say jewels, we mean...

495
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:51,031
...Indian diamonds, Burmese rubies and
Colombian emeralds the size of your fist.

496
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:55,032
We should probably start with what Tess
and I got excited about on our honeymoon.

497
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,261
Well, I think we can all guess.

498
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:01,298
After we lost the court case...

499
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:04,205
...we decided to go backpacking in Spain
for two weeks.

500
00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:09,276
Ended up spending two years
in the Archives of the Indies in Seville.

501
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,645
You spent your honeymoon in a library?

502
00:41:12,086 --> 00:41:13,348
<i>Okay.</i>

503
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:18,990
I love you.
Oh, baby, I love you too.

504
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,857
Where every known record,
official transcript and royal decree...

505
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,498
...relating to the fleets
has been kept for centuries.

506
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:28,897
<i>At first it was for fun, but then
we decided to look up the Aurelia...</i>

507
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,766
...because of the cannon we'd found in
Florida, and it became our pet project.

508
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,377
Especially when we learned the captain was
an 18-year-old kid named Sebastian Vangor.

509
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:40,309
Who we also discovered
was the illegitimate son...

510
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:43,917
<i>...of Captain General Don Juan Ubilla
of the Capitana...</i>

511
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:47,247
...and his Mexican mistress,
Francesca Vangor.

512
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:51,289
We thought it was an interesting sidebar
and really didn't think much more of it...

513
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:57,488
...until Tess found this very obscure
Spanish book published in 1905...

514
00:41:57,665 --> 00:42:01,157
<i>...titled, The vangors:
An 18th Century Family.</i>

515
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:04,099
- It was a collection of letters.
- So why is this important?

516
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:08,708
Because the Vangors controlled
the mule train that transported the Dowry...

517
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:11,538
...over the mountains
from the Pacific to the Caribbean...

518
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:14,681
...and then loaded it onto Spanish galleons
here in Veracruz.

519
00:42:14,848 --> 00:42:18,249
So I'm reading this, and all
of a sudden I start hyperventilating...

520
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:22,856
...because there it is right in front of me
in Ubilla's last letter to Francesca.

521
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:24,650
He wrote:

522
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:28,450
<i>"My faith in the Aurelia
is that she is swift and light...</i>

523
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,530
...and can outrun the storms
we will most certainly encounter.

524
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:35,396
But it is my faith in Sebastian
that knows no bounds.

525
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:39,335
Our son is good and strong
and wiser than this old fool...

526
00:42:39,506 --> 00:42:42,441
...who leaves your bed
more and more reluctantly.

527
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:48,344
The glory of the Spanish Crown
rests in his capable hands. "

528
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:52,041
So...

529
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:54,384
...Ubilla pulled a switch.

530
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:56,045
Mm.
- With the Vangors' help.

531
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:02,194
<i>And moved the Queen's Dowry
from the Capitana to the supply ship.</i>

532
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:03,387
Because?

533
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:05,725
<i>The Capitana
was already way overloaded...</i>

534
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:08,367
...so it was very heavy and very slow.

535
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:10,799
It wasn't just hurricanes
they had to worry about.

536
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:13,269
British warships,
French privateers, you name it.

537
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,841
About the time Finn and I were ready
to leave, we found this article...

538
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,640
...about a Spanish sailor
who was rescued off a deserted island...

539
00:43:20,814 --> 00:43:22,907
...after being shipwrecked for three years.

540
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,277
Off Topsail Cay?

541
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:27,682
- Right. 1718.
- Three years after the hurricane.

542
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:31,621
A Dutch frigate had come to grief
on the shoals off of Topsail Cay...

543
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:34,260
...and while waiting for the tide to rise...

544
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:37,488
...they saw what they thought
was an old man paddling out on a log.

545
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:41,260
Only he wasn't an old man.
He was 21 years old.

546
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:44,461
Looked like Tom Hanks in that movie.
What was that movie?

547
00:43:44,638 --> 00:43:45,662
Um...

548
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,765
<i>- Cast Away.
- Ha-ha.</i>

549
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:50,034
- Yes.
- Ha-ha.

550
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,976
He told the Dutch captain
his name was Raphael Serrano...

551
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:56,639
<i>...of the tobacco ship Francesca.</i>

552
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,250
Ha. As in mother of Sebastian.

553
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,512
- Yes.
- Exactly.

554
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:02,486
Now, he said...

555
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:06,148
...he had struck the same reef
and sunk in just 30 feet of water.

556
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,059
Wow.

557
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,196
You guys must really like treasure.

558
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,356
Yes. I mean, it's very impressive...

559
00:44:14,535 --> 00:44:17,402
...but it's still thin.

560
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,802
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Only Francesca...</i>

561
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:23,633
...she didn't sink off Topsail Cay.

562
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:28,178
She sank off the coast of Veracruz
in 1708...

563
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:31,944
...with all hands,
including her captain, Raphael Serrano.

564
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:34,386
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Neither did we.

565
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:38,992
<i>Until we discovered the Francesca
had been owned by the Vangor family.</i>

566
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,023
Yeah.

567
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:46,462
So, what do we know
about Sebastian Vangor?

568
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:52,963
Well, we know for a fact that
he survived a hurricane, a shipwreck...

569
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:57,133
...starvation, pirates, most likely,
and then he lied about it.

570
00:44:58,345 --> 00:45:02,247
Now, why lie about being part
of the greatest treasure fleet in history?

571
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,084
Unless you're sitting on top
of a huge secret.

572
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:10,815
A secret that nobody, not even
the king of Spain, knew existed.

573
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:14,560
Well, I can think of only one reason:

574
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:17,025
Honor.

575
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:20,523
Because his father had entrusted him...

576
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:22,896
...with precious gifts
mankind had never seen...

577
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,507
...he had to survive
to fulfill the privilege...

578
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:30,370
...Ubilla had bestowed on him
that fateful day in Veracruz.

579
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:31,602
That's why he lied.

580
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:37,679
That's why he lived.

581
00:45:38,585 --> 00:45:40,576
And that's why we can't give up.

582
00:45:44,725 --> 00:45:48,889
Sebastian Vangor is the unsung hero
of an entire nation...

583
00:45:49,062 --> 00:45:51,053
...and we intend to prove it.

584
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:54,929
- So, what happened to him?
- Sebastian?

585
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:57,631
He was taken off the Dutch ship
in Martinique...

586
00:45:57,805 --> 00:46:00,569
...and died a week later of consumption.
- Oh...

587
00:46:00,741 --> 00:46:02,265
He drank too much?

588
00:46:03,377 --> 00:46:07,814
No. Um... Consumption, darling.
As in tuberculosis.

589
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:12,247
Not to be confused with consuming,
as in guzzling.

590
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:15,388
Oh, man. I'm so dumb.

591
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:17,614
Huh. You wanna hear dumb?

592
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:22,751
I used to think that it meant he died
having sex, as in consummating.

593
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,225
- You did?
- Yeah.

594
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:26,559
You did?

595
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:28,291
Yeah.

596
00:46:28,802 --> 00:46:31,066
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

597
00:46:34,408 --> 00:46:38,071
Anyway, that's our idea.

598
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:41,737
It's Tess' mostly, she was always
the brains of the operation.

599
00:46:43,617 --> 00:46:47,519
Well, Gemma? What do you think?

600
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:49,315
You're asking me?

601
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:50,514
I am.

602
00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:53,524
A treasure hunt in the Bahamas?

603
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:57,994
Or a month with Kerry and Vivante
in the Yucatân?

604
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:06,167
Will you teach me how to dive?

605
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:09,632
Yes, I will.

606
00:47:10,978 --> 00:47:12,502
- Tess.
- Hey, Alfonz.

607
00:47:13,313 --> 00:47:15,747
- Long time.
- This is Mr. Nigel Honeycutt. Alfonz.

608
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,315
Welcome aboard.

609
00:47:17,484 --> 00:47:19,384
This is Gemma Honeycutt. Alfonz.

610
00:47:19,553 --> 00:47:21,453
Pleased to meet you.

611
00:47:38,505 --> 00:47:39,699
Like that.

612
00:47:40,307 --> 00:47:42,070
- There you go.
- Thank you.

613
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:45,273
And... Whoa.

614
00:47:59,526 --> 00:48:01,357
Okay. Okay.

615
00:48:10,003 --> 00:48:12,062
Now, the island is basically triangular.

616
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:14,833
You got cliffs and breakers,
harbor and town, and beach.

617
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:18,102
Now, I found the plate near the reef
just on the other side.

618
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:20,803
But you haven't got
the exact coordinates?

619
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,506
The exact position
of the find is irrelevant.

620
00:48:23,684 --> 00:48:26,915
- Why?
- We, uh, kind of left a marker.

621
00:48:27,087 --> 00:48:30,056
We set the boat on fire,
and then we sank it.

622
00:48:30,223 --> 00:48:33,090
- But we would never do that to your boat.
- Nope, just my boat.

623
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,557
- Our boat.
- My boat.

624
00:48:34,728 --> 00:48:36,059
- Our boat.
- My boat.

625
00:48:36,229 --> 00:48:41,223
Hey, did you know that this entire island
is owned by Bigg Bunny Deenz?

626
00:48:41,702 --> 00:48:44,262
- Who?
- He owns the whole island?

627
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,931
Bigg Bunny Deenz.

628
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:50,906
Oh, yes, I remember.

629
00:48:51,078 --> 00:48:55,208
Didn't he murder someone
named Fuzzy Dice...

630
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:57,009
...or Pogo Stick or something?

631
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,584
His name was Exta-C.

632
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:01,311
You're really close.

633
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:02,955
And he was totally acquitted.

634
00:49:03,123 --> 00:49:07,787
Well, it was difficult to secure a conviction
because he murdered all the witnesses.

635
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:10,395
You are really incredible, Finn.

636
00:49:10,564 --> 00:49:14,364
Okay, so he owns the island. So what?
He doesn't own the water.

637
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,970
And how's he gonna feel when we're
hauling treasure up out of the water...

638
00:49:18,138 --> 00:49:20,106
...in front of his beach house?

639
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:24,469
- Supportive?
- I told you not to get involved with him.

640
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:28,342
What if we need food or fuel
or flashlight batteries?

641
00:49:28,515 --> 00:49:30,312
Will you relax, Tess?

642
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:33,577
<i>It's Aurelia.</i>

643
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:39,518
She's right around the corner,
and she's all ours.

644
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,500
Hey, guys.
Come look at this boat.

645
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:57,133
It's got these really big, um, tubes
going in the water off the back.

646
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,187
Is that where you found the plate?

647
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,394
Man, oh, man.

648
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:25,129
Anybody but me wanna spend
a weekend in Paris with that boat?

649
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:28,433
- I think she's already taken.
- What?

650
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:36,816
Oh, you son of a...

651
00:50:36,983 --> 00:50:38,007
Bitch.

652
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:39,709
- What's the matter?
- It's Moe.

653
00:50:39,886 --> 00:50:41,353
- What?
- What is it?

654
00:50:45,092 --> 00:50:47,754
What's happened?
- I'm pretty sure hell just froze over.

655
00:50:48,495 --> 00:50:51,191
Well, don't that just beat all.

656
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:55,497
<i>The Aurelia's mine, goddamn it.</i>

657
00:50:55,669 --> 00:50:57,603
Not if I find her first.

658
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,331
Looks like he's only been here
a day or two.

659
00:51:02,509 --> 00:51:05,205
- How can you tell?
- It's a full day's work to lay the grid.

660
00:51:05,378 --> 00:51:07,312
But... So, what are they looking for?

661
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,006
Do you really not know
the answer to that?

662
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:16,684
Darling.

663
00:51:18,391 --> 00:51:19,585
Huh.

664
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,489
Oh...

665
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:24,663
- I will go comfort her.
- No, you stay there.

666
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,458
I'm sorry, but she's gotta learn...

667
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:29,625
...there's better ways to get attention
than acting like a bimbo.

668
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:31,464
Like what?

669
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:00,463
Ahoy there. Good morning.

670
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:04,161
Morning to you.
That's quite a bucket you got there.

671
00:52:04,337 --> 00:52:05,361
Hello, Moe.

672
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:09,534
- Hey, darling.
- Small world, huh?

673
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,768
Where's that good-for-nothing husband?

674
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:14,311
- Ex-husband.
- Congratulations.

675
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,626
Find anything yet, Mr. Fitch?

676
00:52:35,802 --> 00:52:39,135
Well, sir, we're just gonna set
off some charges and take a look.

677
00:52:39,306 --> 00:52:43,766
You might wanna ease back a ways just
in case we accidentally scratch your finish.

678
00:52:43,944 --> 00:52:45,241
I'll tell the captain.

679
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,642
Let's blow some holes.

680
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:51,940
Come on.
I'm getting old, let's find some gold.

681
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:03,654
Oh, my God.

682
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:06,394
- What?
- Delay, delay.

683
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:08,397
Uh, excuse me, Moe?

684
00:53:09,069 --> 00:53:14,097
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the Ukrainian sidekick.

685
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:17,038
I don't think of myself that way.

686
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:21,510
I am the lead character in my own story.
Ha.

687
00:53:21,848 --> 00:53:26,444
But why does everyone I know think
I'm hot except the ones on this boat?

688
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,917
We think you're hot.

689
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:29,715
- Are you kidding me?
- I know I do.

690
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,085
Gemma. I need your help.
No time to explain.

691
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:36,093
What do you want?
Some expert advice on how to be stupid?

692
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,821
Oh...

693
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:41,900
Look. See how dumb they are?

694
00:53:43,937 --> 00:53:45,029
Yeah.

695
00:53:45,205 --> 00:53:48,732
They can't help it. You can. The end.

696
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,001
Let's go.

697
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,974
- Okay.
- Okay, you're on.

698
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,676
- Okay.
- All right, go, go, go.

699
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:05,917
Hi.

700
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:08,761
Hi. I'm Gemma.

701
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:10,658
Hi.

702
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,195
Hey. Hey, hey.

703
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:17,133
- It's Gemma Honeycutt.
- Are you serious?

704
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:18,362
It's Gemma Honeycutt.

705
00:54:18,538 --> 00:54:22,634
- Hi. What are your names? Oh.
- I'm Happy.

706
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:25,073
- I'm Jim.
- Hi.

707
00:54:25,245 --> 00:54:27,338
- Hi.
- Petruchio, eh.

708
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,415
So did you all grow up on this boat?

709
00:54:30,817 --> 00:54:33,809
- Oh! Oh, my God, there's Finn.
- Gemma.

710
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:40,456
Goddamn bastard. I'll get
that little shit out of there myself.

711
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:46,398
What, are you crazy, Moe?

712
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:53,061
Who the hell set off that charge?
There's a man down there.

713
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:54,900
- What the hell?
- Right over here.

714
00:54:55,075 --> 00:54:57,134
He ripped up the grid.
Nobody rips the grid.

715
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:59,938
Anybody gonna kill that boy,
it's gonna be me.

716
00:55:00,113 --> 00:55:01,512
Okay.

717
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,061
Finn?

718
00:55:27,107 --> 00:55:29,166
- Hey, honey.
- Ha-ha-ha!

719
00:55:29,342 --> 00:55:32,106
- You go, girl.
- I'll be right over.

720
00:55:32,278 --> 00:55:33,472
Hey.

721
00:55:33,646 --> 00:55:36,513
Bravo. Bravo.

722
00:55:36,683 --> 00:55:39,481
Oh, shit.

723
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:44,582
Oh, hello, Moe.

724
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:47,855
Hello, Finn. Anything broke?

725
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:51,561
- I don't think so.
- Good.

726
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:56,267
- Finn!
- Finn! Oh!

727
00:55:58,238 --> 00:55:59,899
Is that all you got, old man?

728
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:05,708
It's difficult to maintain enthusiasm
for your leadership...

729
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:09,838
...when you keep getting beat up
by that old man.

730
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:12,814
He's 56 years old.

731
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:14,247
I can't hit him.

732
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:16,685
That's quite obvious.

733
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:26,256
Was that a yellow and white
Cessna 206 seaplane?

734
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:30,767
I would describe it more
as banana and cream.

735
00:56:30,937 --> 00:56:34,930
I still can't get over the way
he just came up out of the water like that.

736
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:36,803
I know, and holding the sword.

737
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,308
And then he just makes
this totally perfect toss...

738
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,141
...and the sword ends up sticking
straight up in the deck.

739
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,942
Amazing.

740
00:56:44,117 --> 00:56:48,781
But it's more than just the sheer power
of his raw sexuality.

741
00:56:48,955 --> 00:56:52,948
It's a totality of his emotional commitment
to the task at hand.

742
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:55,060
Yeah, it's the focus. It's the focus.

743
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:57,093
He sees it. He wants it.

744
00:56:57,564 --> 00:57:00,931
- He goes after it. He gets it.
- He sure got me.

745
00:57:01,101 --> 00:57:02,625
Do you mind?

746
00:57:03,703 --> 00:57:05,830
- I'm sorry.
- We're sorry.

747
00:57:11,311 --> 00:57:12,608
Well...

748
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:16,909
Here's to a wonderfully exciting first day...

749
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:21,042
...and to the safe landing
of our glorious leader.

750
00:57:21,888 --> 00:57:25,915
Hear, says I. Hear, hear, Nigel.
You the man.

751
00:57:27,594 --> 00:57:29,152
No, he meant you, stupid.

752
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:30,853
What?

753
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,498
- No, Finn, honey, Finn.
- Oh.

754
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:36,567
There's port in the salon
if anyone's interested...

755
00:57:36,736 --> 00:57:38,636
...and a wonderful selection of cigars...

756
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:42,263
...if anyone feels like
ruining the evening for the rest of us...

757
00:57:42,442 --> 00:57:43,739
...and cupcakes.

758
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,468
Are there any prostitutes?

759
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,576
Sorry. No.

760
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,445
Well, maybe we can call some.

761
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,487
Oh. My God, are you serious?

762
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:59,287
Pay him no attention, Gemma,
he's a provocateur.

763
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:03,190
Okay, but we're not in France right now,
we're in America.

764
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:09,893
- Think I'm gonna head to bed.
- That's it for me tonight.

765
00:58:12,105 --> 00:58:15,302
A coincidence that we got up together,
and we're both going to bed...

766
00:58:15,475 --> 00:58:18,137
...because we're not going
to bed together.

767
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:19,335
- Obviously.
- No.

768
00:58:19,512 --> 00:58:21,707
Well, it's really none of our business.

769
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:23,781
Or even interesting.

770
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,781
- What she's trying to say...
- Good night.

771
00:58:25,952 --> 00:58:27,385
Good night.

772
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:30,248
Good night.

773
00:58:30,623 --> 00:58:33,319
Nigel, great day.
Gemma, sweet dreams.

774
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:43,163
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Tess.

775
00:58:47,874 --> 00:58:49,535
I hope...

776
00:58:50,743 --> 00:58:52,472
I hope, Gemma...

777
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:57,772
...it hasn't been too dull for you here.

778
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,478
Of course not, Daddy.
It's been really fun.

779
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:03,315
Yes.

780
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,782
Do you still play gin rummy?

781
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,486
Oh, my God, all the time.
Whenever I fly.

782
00:59:11,564 --> 00:59:13,532
Oh. Penny a point?

783
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:36,450
Hey, it's Tess.

784
00:59:36,623 --> 00:59:42,892
Don't get the wrong idea,
I just, uh, wanna talk. Um...

785
00:59:43,463 --> 00:59:49,402
I just thought,
since I've been kind of critical recently...

786
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:54,930
...maybe I should tell you
how magnificent you were today...

787
00:59:55,108 --> 00:59:58,202
...you know, taking out their grid and...

788
00:59:59,545 --> 01:00:01,513
You couldn't hit Moe back.

789
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:04,712
Uh, it just reminded me of how...

790
01:00:08,754 --> 01:00:10,517
Are you in here?

791
01:00:18,163 --> 01:00:19,289
Oh.

792
01:00:27,339 --> 01:00:28,806
Gin.

793
01:00:28,974 --> 01:00:30,669
What?

794
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,548
Hundred and five.

795
01:00:36,715 --> 01:00:38,808
Twenty-eight thousand.

796
01:00:39,885 --> 01:00:43,719
- Dollars?
- Well, it's all going to charity, Daddy.

797
01:00:45,757 --> 01:00:48,089
Well, darling, I'm very pleased
you've inherited...

798
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:51,161
<i>...not only your mother's beauty
and na:ï:ve charm...</i>

799
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:57,092
...but also her singular talent for
getting huge sums of money out of me...

800
01:00:57,269 --> 01:00:59,533
...with a modicum of effort.

801
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:05,535
What's wrong?

802
01:01:08,046 --> 01:01:09,445
I don't want it.

803
01:01:09,615 --> 01:01:12,709
I'm sorry. It was a joke.

804
01:01:16,355 --> 01:01:18,448
I mean, be honest...

805
01:01:18,624 --> 01:01:23,118
...she didn't exactly marry me for love,
did she?

806
01:01:30,636 --> 01:01:32,763
My mother...

807
01:01:32,938 --> 01:01:38,103
...was a 24-year-old blackjack dealer
from Nebraska.

808
01:01:38,944 --> 01:01:43,176
You had to tip her $500
just to have a drink with you.

809
01:01:43,348 --> 01:01:46,875
You got married two weeks later
at the age of 175.

810
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:48,747
- 51 to be precise.
- Now you're mad...

811
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:52,152
...because she had the brains to get
some money before you dumped her?

812
01:01:52,324 --> 01:01:53,757
No, I'm mad about the amount.

813
01:01:53,926 --> 01:01:57,418
Oh, well, okay, you can have mine.
Because I'm cutting myself off.

814
01:01:57,596 --> 01:02:00,827
I don't want anything from you anymore.

815
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,036
Except for food. And clothes.

816
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:09,068
And rent and, like, travel.

817
01:02:09,241 --> 01:02:11,402
And I'm totally serious.

818
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:18,174
Yes, that's what is so frightening
about it.

819
01:02:20,919 --> 01:02:22,580
Gemma?

820
01:02:26,758 --> 01:02:28,487
For what it's worth...

821
01:02:28,961 --> 01:02:32,419
...I loved your mother, and I love you.

822
01:03:17,476 --> 01:03:20,274
You believe in ghosts, Curtis?

823
01:03:21,246 --> 01:03:25,410
You know what,
you are some kind of stupid.

824
01:03:25,584 --> 01:03:28,075
Now you sound like my wife.

825
01:03:28,253 --> 01:03:29,550
Bunny around?

826
01:03:29,721 --> 01:03:34,249
You know, I can't hear you,
you talking to my deaf ear.

827
01:03:34,426 --> 01:03:36,189
Oh, sorry.

828
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,158
Curtis?

829
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,848
Take me to see Bigg Bunny.

830
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:04,546
Bigg Bunny ain't never wanna find out
you didn't drown the first time.

831
01:04:05,891 --> 01:04:07,222
Okay.

832
01:04:09,094 --> 01:04:10,584
Shit.

833
01:04:12,998 --> 01:04:15,398
When's the last time
you had this thing sharpened?

834
01:04:16,601 --> 01:04:18,000
1715.

835
01:04:22,407 --> 01:04:24,204
Okay, okay, okay, one second.

836
01:04:24,609 --> 01:04:29,308
Now look, 20 people saw me today,
everybody on Moe's boat.

837
01:04:29,481 --> 01:04:32,109
Now if you guys take me to Bigg Bunny...

838
01:04:32,284 --> 01:04:36,380
...it's gonna look a lot better than if
he finds out I'm alive from someone else.

839
01:04:37,522 --> 01:04:41,253
- It ain't his decision no more.
- Now, who in the hell are you?

840
01:04:50,435 --> 01:04:52,096
Ow.

841
01:04:52,537 --> 01:04:55,131
Ain't no fool like a gold fool.

842
01:04:55,307 --> 01:04:57,502
Ain't that right, Mr. Finnegan?

843
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:00,705
Who's the new guy?

844
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:05,710
This here is Cyrus.
He's my new, uh, chief of staff.

845
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:09,720
He's helping me to refocus, reform,
and renew.

846
01:05:10,422 --> 01:05:13,858
What do you need him for, huh?
We handling it.

847
01:05:18,096 --> 01:05:19,120
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

848
01:05:19,297 --> 01:05:22,061
God, jeez. What's the...?

849
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:24,133
Why'd you do that?

850
01:05:24,302 --> 01:05:26,065
Just a little restructure.

851
01:05:26,638 --> 01:05:30,802
See, you let this boy get past
you not just once, but twice.

852
01:05:30,976 --> 01:05:32,238
So I hope you focused now.

853
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:35,174
Oh, extremely focused. Very motivated.

854
01:05:35,347 --> 01:05:39,181
My morale probably 20 percent higher
than when I came in here.

855
01:05:39,351 --> 01:05:41,546
- Can I get a word in?
- What? What do you want?

856
01:05:42,621 --> 01:05:44,919
I wanna buy some time.

857
01:05:45,991 --> 01:05:47,982
You still breathing, ain't you?

858
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:50,894
Yeah, thank you.

859
01:05:51,463 --> 01:05:52,521
Now, hear me out.

860
01:05:53,598 --> 01:05:57,193
All right, the way I see it, you bet
on Moe, you got a fifty-fifty chance...

861
01:05:57,369 --> 01:06:01,863
...but you bet on the both of us, and we
cover twice the ground in half the time...

862
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:07,478
...and I'm willing to give you 10 percent
of everything I find.

863
01:06:08,246 --> 01:06:11,181
Plus what I already owe you, of course.

864
01:06:12,017 --> 01:06:13,917
How much you say?

865
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:16,679
Ten percent, across-the-board.

866
01:06:16,855 --> 01:06:18,220
Ten percent, huh?

867
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,218
Wow.

868
01:06:21,026 --> 01:06:23,586
- Say it again.
- Come on, what...?

869
01:06:23,762 --> 01:06:25,161
You know, 12 percent's cool.

870
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:27,924
You know, I couldn't even hear you.
What you say?

871
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:31,125
- Fifteen percent, but I gotta find...
- I'm sorry, how much?

872
01:06:31,303 --> 01:06:34,272
- Eighteen, but I owe other people.
- That don't sound right.

873
01:06:34,439 --> 01:06:36,839
- Twenty percent, but that's it, final.
- Oh.

874
01:06:37,008 --> 01:06:38,839
Damn it. What? How much do you want?

875
01:06:39,711 --> 01:06:41,542
I'll tell you what.

876
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:48,144
You find the treasure and I won't kill you.

877
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:07,394
- How much do you owe him?
- Whoa.

878
01:07:08,473 --> 01:07:10,464
Jesus, Tess.

879
01:07:11,576 --> 01:07:12,702
How much do you owe him?

880
01:07:16,214 --> 01:07:19,183
Owe who? Owe who what?

881
01:07:19,584 --> 01:07:20,744
Bigg Bunny.

882
01:07:21,753 --> 01:07:23,220
I don't owe him any money.

883
01:07:23,388 --> 01:07:26,880
Finn, how much do you owe him?

884
01:07:27,459 --> 01:07:29,984
Just tell me so I'll know.

885
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:33,562
Oh, God, Tess. I mean, that's so hard
to be specific about.

886
01:07:33,732 --> 01:07:36,200
- It's a really complex payment schedule...
- How much?

887
01:07:36,368 --> 01:07:41,032
Sixty-two thousand, five hundred and
eighty-one dollars and forty-three cents.

888
01:07:43,108 --> 01:07:44,370
But we're good now.

889
01:07:45,243 --> 01:07:47,575
Is there a reason
you didn't tell me this before?

890
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,270
Yeah.

891
01:07:53,018 --> 01:07:54,781
You wouldn't have come.

892
01:07:56,521 --> 01:07:58,148
Yeah, I would.

893
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:03,321
Just wouldn't have come with you.

894
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:14,295
Are we finished?

895
01:08:18,376 --> 01:08:20,207
We sure are.

896
01:08:33,024 --> 01:08:34,218
- You good?
- Yeah.

897
01:08:34,392 --> 01:08:36,019
Okay.

898
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:38,895
What happened to your face?

899
01:08:39,998 --> 01:08:42,432
Somebody hit me with a cricket bat.

900
01:08:42,634 --> 01:08:43,999
Ah.

901
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:48,799
- This is a new type of regulator...
- Shove it up your ass.

902
01:08:48,973 --> 01:08:51,237
- All right, we're good to go.
- Ready, darling?

903
01:08:51,409 --> 01:08:53,274
Drop dead.

904
01:08:54,212 --> 01:08:56,703
This is just like the old days, huh?

905
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:29,842
Hello, darling.

906
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:32,740
Drink?

907
01:09:34,786 --> 01:09:36,117
I have one.

908
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:47,855
You know what else
is really bugging me?

909
01:10:48,626 --> 01:10:49,991
No.

910
01:10:50,161 --> 01:10:54,393
Please, tell us. Because I may personally
drop dead from disappointment...

911
01:10:54,566 --> 01:10:58,764
...if I don't find out the 700-millionth thing
about life on planet Earth...

912
01:10:58,937 --> 01:11:00,598
...that is bugging you.

913
01:11:01,172 --> 01:11:02,537
Well, this is fun.

914
01:11:02,707 --> 01:11:04,140
No, listen.

915
01:11:04,776 --> 01:11:08,337
If I am the Dutch frigate
stuck on a reef in a dead calm...

916
01:11:08,513 --> 01:11:11,573
<i>...in the same cove
the Aurelia sank three years earlier...</i>

917
01:11:11,749 --> 01:11:15,947
...in less than 30 feet
of the clearest water in the world...

918
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:20,723
Then how come I can't see her?

919
01:11:24,896 --> 01:11:26,921
Because she isn't there.

920
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:30,493
Yeah, I don't know.

921
01:11:30,668 --> 01:11:34,627
No, no, no. Sebastian specifically said
that's where she sank.

922
01:11:34,806 --> 01:11:36,637
- And he said it.
- Yeah.

923
01:11:36,808 --> 01:11:41,074
My dear children, your entire theory
is predicated on the proposition...

924
01:11:41,246 --> 01:11:46,013
...that Sebastian lied about everything he
could to prevent the ship being found.

925
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:50,314
So why on Earth would
he tell the truth about where she sank?

926
01:11:51,322 --> 01:11:54,519
<i>I mean, it seems to me that
the Aurelia can't be in the cove...</i>

927
01:11:54,692 --> 01:11:58,128
...for the simple reason that
that's where Sebastian said she was.

928
01:12:13,611 --> 01:12:14,737
Sorry to disturb.

929
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:17,609
We've had to move to the lee side
on account of the storm.

930
01:12:17,782 --> 01:12:19,807
She won't fit in the marina?

931
01:12:19,984 --> 01:12:23,613
Afraid not. A taxi will take you
to the beach on the north end.

932
01:12:23,788 --> 01:12:26,780
- Call, we'll pick you up on the launch.
- Better safe than sorry.

933
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:28,391
Sir.

934
01:12:29,093 --> 01:12:31,994
I've grown rather fond of not sinking.

935
01:12:32,196 --> 01:12:34,221
Ugh. Don't even say that.

936
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:37,334
Oh, it would be a shame
to lose the art collection.

937
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:38,693
Or Gemma's shoes.

938
01:12:39,604 --> 01:12:43,233
Especially because we're so close
to shore, you know?

939
01:12:47,078 --> 01:12:48,170
Oh, my God.

940
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:51,548
What?

941
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,178
Oh, my God, of course.

942
01:12:53,351 --> 01:12:55,012
Of course what?

943
01:12:57,221 --> 01:12:59,746
You are a genius.

944
01:13:01,593 --> 01:13:02,753
Stefan.

945
01:13:03,194 --> 01:13:05,287
- Stefan.
- Yes.

946
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:08,224
Why did you pick the north beach?

947
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:11,861
I didn't. It's the only beach on the
island not blocked by the reef.

948
01:13:12,637 --> 01:13:15,765
Yes. Yes. He ran her aground.

949
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,601
What are you so happy about?

950
01:13:17,775 --> 01:13:20,300
- He ran her aground.
- What?

951
01:13:20,478 --> 01:13:26,178
To save the Dowry. Sebastian ran
the whole goddamn thing aground.

952
01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:30,943
Bet you $ 1000 I find something
between here and that beach.

953
01:13:31,122 --> 01:13:32,851
You don't have $ 1000.

954
01:13:33,591 --> 01:13:34,683
Fine, make it 10.

955
01:13:35,259 --> 01:13:36,726
You don't have $ 10.

956
01:13:37,495 --> 01:13:39,554
Fine, make it a million.

957
01:13:45,803 --> 01:13:47,361
What are you doing?

958
01:13:47,538 --> 01:13:50,371
You think I'm letting you go out
there alone, you're crazy.

959
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:52,198
What, you don't trust me?

960
01:13:52,377 --> 01:13:54,937
Why on Earth would I trust you?

961
01:13:56,447 --> 01:13:57,971
Huh.

962
01:15:15,293 --> 01:15:17,158
- I found a cannon.
- I found a cannon.

963
01:15:17,328 --> 01:15:18,989
- You did what?
- You mean there's two?

964
01:15:19,163 --> 01:15:20,653
- There's two cannons.
- Aah!

965
01:15:20,832 --> 01:15:23,699
- And I owe you a million dollars. Aah!
- Yes, you do. Oh!

966
01:15:23,868 --> 01:15:25,301
Whoo!

967
01:15:25,737 --> 01:15:27,568
<i>We got the Aurelia, baby!</i>

968
01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:32,233
Listen to me, if anybody finds out about
this outside of our crew, we are screwed.

969
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:35,004
Wow. Can't you just enjoy this
for a second?

970
01:15:36,247 --> 01:15:38,272
Oh, I'm enjoying it.

971
01:15:42,153 --> 01:15:45,316
Oh, God. Thank God.

972
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,394
Whoo-hoo!

973
01:16:18,623 --> 01:16:19,920
Well, there's not much here.

974
01:16:20,091 --> 01:16:24,027
Now, they probably burned the ship
and took everything inland.

975
01:16:24,195 --> 01:16:27,653
Look, a pistol.
Cool.

976
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:31,165
All right, well, what do we know
about Topsail Cay?

977
01:16:31,569 --> 01:16:33,901
We got the town, the church...

978
01:16:34,071 --> 01:16:35,197
There's Preacher's Cave.

979
01:16:35,373 --> 01:16:38,399
We were up there once.
It said something about first settlers...

980
01:16:38,576 --> 01:16:39,600
...religious freedom...

981
01:16:39,777 --> 01:16:42,302
God, I think that is just so important.

982
01:16:44,015 --> 01:16:45,312
Yeah, but that was like...

983
01:16:46,217 --> 01:16:49,709
- Oh.
- Like 1780-something.

984
01:16:50,855 --> 01:16:54,120
I mean, Sebastian beat them here
by almost 70 years.

985
01:16:54,292 --> 01:16:56,487
If there are any records,
they're in the church.

986
01:16:56,661 --> 01:16:59,892
- Letters, journals, sermons.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

987
01:17:01,232 --> 01:17:03,359
That's smart, Tess.

988
01:17:04,135 --> 01:17:06,569
It's the oldest building on the island.

989
01:17:08,472 --> 01:17:09,871
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

990
01:17:17,982 --> 01:17:19,677
When Moe finds out we're gone...

991
01:17:19,851 --> 01:17:22,319
...he's gonna come barreling up
your ass like a freight train.

992
01:17:22,486 --> 01:17:24,716
Oh, my, that ought to be interesting.

993
01:17:24,889 --> 01:17:27,756
Well, I'm just saying
we don't have much time.

994
01:17:28,392 --> 01:17:29,450
Oh, my God.

995
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:31,252
Stop the boat!

996
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:35,456
I just figured it out. It's been
right in front of us this whole time.

997
01:17:35,633 --> 01:17:36,759
What?

998
01:17:37,368 --> 01:17:39,598
<i>Precious Gem.</i>

999
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:41,462
Yes.

1000
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:47,673
Well, do you realize how incredibly similar
the word "gem" is to "Gemma"?

1001
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:51,279
Uh... I thought I did.

1002
01:17:51,449 --> 01:17:52,848
My God.

1003
01:17:53,017 --> 01:17:56,714
Daddy, you named the boat after me
and didn't even know it.

1004
01:17:58,289 --> 01:17:59,415
I didn't?

1005
01:18:00,524 --> 01:18:01,650
Don't you see?

1006
01:18:04,795 --> 01:18:09,232
You were running away to sea,
only you wanted to bring me along.

1007
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,528
So you unconsciously
named the boat after me.

1008
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:17,908
That is so beautiful.

1009
01:18:24,148 --> 01:18:26,912
Of course I named it for you, Gemma.

1010
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:33,254
But it wasn't unconscious.
I gave it a lot of thought.

1011
01:18:33,424 --> 01:18:37,258
No. You did it unconsciously.

1012
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:42,424
And then I did it unconsciously.

1013
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,050
Good afternoon.

1014
01:19:09,226 --> 01:19:11,285
Afternoon. May I help you?

1015
01:19:11,462 --> 01:19:14,090
- I hope so. I'm Finnegan.
- Nice to meet you.

1016
01:19:14,265 --> 01:19:15,459
- Tess.
- Tess.

1017
01:19:29,447 --> 01:19:30,971
Don't even think about it.

1018
01:19:31,749 --> 01:19:34,809
- What?
- Don't "what" me. You know what.

1019
01:19:35,987 --> 01:19:39,184
It's weird, right?

1020
01:19:40,658 --> 01:19:43,821
- What?
- This.

1021
01:19:44,462 --> 01:19:46,089
Us, together.

1022
01:19:46,497 --> 01:19:50,331
It's complex, but not in a good way.

1023
01:19:55,239 --> 01:19:59,300
Well, can I just say
I really wish we were still married?

1024
01:20:04,448 --> 01:20:05,972
No.

1025
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:16,292
Oh, my God, listen to this.

1026
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:19,327
Listen. "That we are by no means...

1027
01:20:19,497 --> 01:20:21,590
...the first Europeans to visit here...

1028
01:20:21,766 --> 01:20:25,293
...is finally proven
by the discovery of a Spanish gravestone...

1029
01:20:25,469 --> 01:20:27,027
...that of a woman.

1030
01:20:27,204 --> 01:20:29,399
I cannot but wonder who she was...

1031
01:20:29,573 --> 01:20:32,838
...and how she came to die here,
for the headstone reads simply...

1032
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:35,240
...'Aurelia, 1715."'

1033
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:36,812
Holy shit.

1034
01:20:36,981 --> 01:20:40,473
"Forsake her I could not.

1035
01:20:40,651 --> 01:20:44,109
And so it was here,
on this beautiful hilltop...

1036
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:47,746
...that I resolved to bury our own dead...

1037
01:20:47,925 --> 01:20:51,918
...and begin work building a church. "

1038
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:55,294
He marked it with a headstone.

1039
01:20:55,466 --> 01:20:57,957
And this guy built a church around it.

1040
01:20:58,135 --> 01:21:00,569
- It's in the cemetery.
- It's in the cemetery.

1041
01:21:06,577 --> 01:21:07,839
- Finn.
- Mm-hm.

1042
01:21:09,513 --> 01:21:11,003
Oh...

1043
01:21:12,216 --> 01:21:14,184
- No, come on.
- Here we go.

1044
01:21:14,351 --> 01:21:15,875
Oh, shit, I got you.

1045
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:20,117
Mm-hm.

1046
01:21:33,370 --> 01:21:35,099
Anything?

1047
01:21:36,373 --> 01:21:38,307
It's not here.

1048
01:21:38,509 --> 01:21:41,034
I refuse to believe that.

1049
01:21:41,545 --> 01:21:46,642
Well, just because you refuse to
believe something doesn't make it true.

1050
01:21:46,817 --> 01:21:48,512
Or false.

1051
01:21:49,386 --> 01:21:51,911
Or whatever the hell I'm saying.

1052
01:21:52,089 --> 01:21:53,113
Something wrong, Tess?

1053
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:56,157
Something wrong?
Why would anything be wrong?

1054
01:21:56,327 --> 01:21:58,955
We just had sex in a church
and we're not even married...

1055
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:01,064
...and now we're gonna dig up a grave.

1056
01:22:01,232 --> 01:22:02,927
What is that, like a triple sin?

1057
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,500
I can't believe we haven't been
struck by lightning. Oh!

1058
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:08,335
- Ow.
- Oh, shit, you okay?

1059
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:11,703
Stupid rock.
That's the second time I've done that.

1060
01:22:11,876 --> 01:22:13,207
Okay, we can't have that.

1061
01:22:13,377 --> 01:22:15,743
Come here, you rock. Stupid rock.

1062
01:22:21,919 --> 01:22:23,284
Wait, stop.

1063
01:22:23,454 --> 01:22:25,649
Oh... Honey, it's heavy.

1064
01:22:27,925 --> 01:22:30,189
So is this.

1065
01:22:56,654 --> 01:22:58,281
Finn? Finn?

1066
01:23:00,124 --> 01:23:01,148
Finn.

1067
01:23:01,325 --> 01:23:02,917
- What?
- What if it's a body?

1068
01:23:06,497 --> 01:23:09,830
Well, then he was a midget
with very cheap relatives.

1069
01:23:12,336 --> 01:23:15,794
- What if it's a head?
- Do you mind?

1070
01:23:59,416 --> 01:24:01,384
Oh, my God.

1071
01:24:04,989 --> 01:24:06,354
It's his.

1072
01:24:06,991 --> 01:24:09,221
"To my everlasting relief...

1073
01:24:09,393 --> 01:24:13,022
...and after a year's toil
in this lonely place...

1074
01:24:13,197 --> 01:24:17,395
...have I finally stumbled upon
a suitable place...

1075
01:24:17,568 --> 01:24:19,559
...for my cargo...

1076
01:24:19,737 --> 01:24:23,901
...fortified by nature
against the encroachments...

1077
01:24:24,074 --> 01:24:25,507
...accidental or deliberate...

1078
01:24:25,676 --> 01:24:30,875
...even of those who would force
our tongues to betray its trust.

1079
01:24:31,849 --> 01:24:37,378
The low December tide showed us
the only way in and the only way out.

1080
01:24:37,554 --> 01:24:39,317
But from January to November...

1081
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:43,688
...the beached whale's spout
is both ingress or egress.

1082
01:24:43,861 --> 01:24:47,922
Thus is the vault rendered,
made virtually impenetrable. "

1083
01:24:48,098 --> 01:24:52,262
The beached whale's spout?
Are you sure?

1084
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,635
Yeah.

1085
01:25:02,112 --> 01:25:04,603
It's a blowhole.

1086
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:08,049
It's the one at Clifton Point.

1087
01:25:08,218 --> 01:25:12,314
- The low December tide drops so low...
- The winter solstice.

1088
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:15,617
The lowest tide of the year
exposes the mouth of the blowhole...

1089
01:25:15,793 --> 01:25:19,251
...which is normally
under 15 to 20 feet of water.

1090
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:21,925
Two days out of the year it's a cave.

1091
01:25:22,433 --> 01:25:25,561
They float the chests in, the tide returns...

1092
01:25:25,736 --> 01:25:28,034
...then the place becomes a deathtrap.

1093
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:32,768
Did we just find our treasure?

1094
01:25:34,244 --> 01:25:35,973
Sound like it.

1095
01:25:37,815 --> 01:25:39,510
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Finnegan.

1096
01:25:40,117 --> 01:25:41,675
Hey, Bunny.

1097
01:25:41,852 --> 01:25:43,752
What the hell are you doing here?

1098
01:25:44,421 --> 01:25:46,048
- Give me the book.
- Come on, Bunny.

1099
01:25:46,223 --> 01:25:51,525
I mean, are you sure you don't wanna,
you know, give it to the new guy?

1100
01:25:58,135 --> 01:26:00,194
What you think you're gonna
do with that, huh?

1101
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:05,534
Hey, you better put the damn shovel...

1102
01:26:09,146 --> 01:26:12,047
Hey, hey, hey, look, you know,
I don't want no trouble.

1103
01:26:12,216 --> 01:26:13,308
Get me out the hole!

1104
01:26:16,954 --> 01:26:19,013
Get him, baby, get him.

1105
01:26:27,531 --> 01:26:28,964
Finn!

1106
01:26:30,934 --> 01:26:33,198
Where you...? What you...? Grab him.

1107
01:26:37,374 --> 01:26:38,739
Come on.

1108
01:26:41,445 --> 01:26:42,935
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
01:26:43,113 --> 01:26:44,171
Come on, go, go, go.

1110
01:26:45,349 --> 01:26:47,340
Hey. Hey...

1111
01:26:51,688 --> 01:26:53,178
Get after them, damn it.

1112
01:26:55,259 --> 01:26:56,283
Hang on.

1113
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:59,224
Cyrus, my bike. Hey, you.

1114
01:27:00,931 --> 01:27:01,955
Are you shot?

1115
01:27:03,267 --> 01:27:05,394
- What?
- Shot? You?

1116
01:27:05,569 --> 01:27:09,096
- No. Are you shot?
- No, not yet.

1117
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,432
We got the book, Cyrus.

1118
01:27:12,609 --> 01:27:14,008
Finn!

1119
01:27:14,178 --> 01:27:15,202
I got you, Tess!

1120
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:19,239
- Duck!
- What? Ugh!

1121
01:27:20,317 --> 01:27:22,148
- Finn!
- Uh-oh.

1122
01:27:26,523 --> 01:27:28,889
Finn. No.

1123
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:35,595
No. Finn. Oh, my...

1124
01:27:42,072 --> 01:27:43,903
Finn.

1125
01:27:45,676 --> 01:27:47,303
Let's go.

1126
01:27:57,821 --> 01:28:01,120
You sure he's dead? I've been
disappointed a lot of times before.

1127
01:28:01,291 --> 01:28:04,488
I should've aimed at your head,
you little son of a bitch.

1128
01:28:04,862 --> 01:28:06,329
I'm gonna tell you what.

1129
01:28:06,497 --> 01:28:09,830
I'm gonna have my boys submit your theory
to a little academic review...

1130
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,264
...while I go sit my balls on some ice.

1131
01:28:36,493 --> 01:28:39,223
After this wave,
you've got about 50 seconds.

1132
01:28:44,268 --> 01:28:45,758
Would you just get in the hole?

1133
01:28:46,203 --> 01:28:48,433
Whoa! Whoo!

1134
01:28:55,712 --> 01:28:57,179
I can't.

1135
01:28:57,381 --> 01:28:58,541
Uh...

1136
01:28:58,715 --> 01:29:00,273
Excuse me, Curtis.

1137
01:29:00,717 --> 01:29:02,651
Get in the hole.

1138
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:07,017
Damn, Cyrus.
Why you always in my business, huh?

1139
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:09,556
I'm handling this shit.

1140
01:29:16,567 --> 01:29:18,398
You know what? You run it.

1141
01:29:20,637 --> 01:29:22,127
You run it.

1142
01:29:42,025 --> 01:29:43,515
It's not here.

1143
01:29:43,694 --> 01:29:45,719
Check underwater.

1144
01:29:47,497 --> 01:29:49,158
There's nothing but rock.

1145
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:50,925
I'm supposed to believe you, am I?

1146
01:29:51,101 --> 01:29:55,800
You want a second opinion, come on down.
Get me out of here.

1147
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:57,201
Please.

1148
01:29:57,407 --> 01:29:58,874
Pull her up, man.

1149
01:30:02,613 --> 01:30:03,637
Hey.

1150
01:30:03,814 --> 01:30:05,782
Say hi to your husband.

1151
01:30:05,949 --> 01:30:07,177
What? No.

1152
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:08,875
What the hell are you doing, man?

1153
01:30:09,052 --> 01:30:10,542
Oh, God.

1154
01:30:17,561 --> 01:30:19,392
Throw me the rope.

1155
01:31:47,384 --> 01:31:48,476
Whoo!

1156
01:31:48,652 --> 01:31:51,553
Now that's what I'm talking about.

1157
01:32:00,063 --> 01:32:01,189
<i>Talk to me.</i>

1158
01:32:01,364 --> 01:32:03,229
It's here. Bring the tanks.

1159
01:32:03,734 --> 01:32:06,635
We're gonna have to go in
through the ocean.

1160
01:32:06,803 --> 01:32:07,895
<i>And the girl?</i>

1161
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:09,231
Uh...

1162
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,039
She won't need one.

1163
01:32:32,395 --> 01:32:33,419
This better be good.

1164
01:32:33,597 --> 01:32:36,532
Moe, it's Finn. It's bad, it's real bad.

1165
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:38,531
<i>- They got Tess.
- What?</i>

1166
01:32:38,702 --> 01:32:41,068
The treasure's in the blowhole
at Clifton Point.

1167
01:32:41,238 --> 01:32:42,262
They took her hostage.

1168
01:33:03,627 --> 01:33:07,586
That is one big-ass,
sensible-sized emerald.

1169
01:33:10,734 --> 01:33:13,202
Sure, go have fun.
Go get yourselves killed.

1170
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:15,565
Go pump some lead in your fellow man.
Go ahead.

1171
01:33:15,739 --> 01:33:16,763
What a sissy.

1172
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:18,931
He is more man
than you'll ever be, honey.

1173
01:33:19,109 --> 01:33:20,576
Hey. You ladies wanna move out?

1174
01:33:21,144 --> 01:33:23,772
They could have killed
a whole graduation class by now.

1175
01:33:23,947 --> 01:33:25,505
Daddy.

1176
01:33:26,416 --> 01:33:29,510
- I'm scared.
- She's going to be all right.

1177
01:33:29,686 --> 01:33:32,553
- I promise.
- I'm worried about you.

1178
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:36,085
Oh, bless you for that.

1179
01:33:37,227 --> 01:33:38,558
I'll see you at breakfast.

1180
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:25,606
Hey! Hey!

1181
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:29,000
Goddamn.

1182
01:34:29,179 --> 01:34:31,374
How many times am I gonna
have to kill this boy?

1183
01:34:39,022 --> 01:34:40,649
Shit.

1184
01:34:45,228 --> 01:34:46,889
Oh, shit.

1185
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:52,198
Somebody help.

1186
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:55,330
Tess!

1187
01:34:56,072 --> 01:34:57,699
Finn?

1188
01:34:58,875 --> 01:35:00,172
Finn!

1189
01:35:11,254 --> 01:35:12,846
Shit.

1190
01:35:47,023 --> 01:35:49,992
Whoo. There's a whole lot more
where this came from.

1191
01:36:04,841 --> 01:36:07,639
- Where's Cyrus?
- He said he'd be right up.

1192
01:36:12,983 --> 01:36:14,644
Mm.

1193
01:36:17,954 --> 01:36:18,978
Ugh.

1194
01:36:23,393 --> 01:36:24,485
Find out who that was.

1195
01:36:24,694 --> 01:36:26,719
- Huh?
- You heard me.

1196
01:37:36,666 --> 01:37:38,065
Oh, my God.

1197
01:37:38,935 --> 01:37:39,993
Shit.

1198
01:37:41,171 --> 01:37:42,331
Cover me.

1199
01:37:42,505 --> 01:37:43,733
Where you going?

1200
01:37:43,907 --> 01:37:46,102
Where's he going? Wait.
Where are you going?

1201
01:37:46,276 --> 01:37:47,402
Shit, man.

1202
01:37:56,119 --> 01:37:57,347
Aah!

1203
01:37:58,521 --> 01:38:00,785
You son of a bitch.

1204
01:38:01,157 --> 01:38:02,454
Uh-oh.

1205
01:38:21,377 --> 01:38:24,676
Here, cock it. Cock it.

1206
01:38:25,648 --> 01:38:28,173
I can't make it cock.

1207
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:36,183
No, no, no.

1208
01:38:46,769 --> 01:38:48,498
Give that to me.

1209
01:38:52,142 --> 01:38:55,077
- You okay, Moe?
- Yeah, great.

1210
01:38:55,245 --> 01:38:58,442
- Get in the plane. Get...
- No. Aah!

1211
01:39:00,283 --> 01:39:03,150
- No.
- Get your hands off her.

1212
01:39:09,859 --> 01:39:10,985
Get in the plane.

1213
01:39:26,176 --> 01:39:27,473
Sit back.

1214
01:39:29,512 --> 01:39:32,572
Get your hands... Sit back now.
Sit back now.

1215
01:39:34,017 --> 01:39:35,609
Shit.

1216
01:40:00,176 --> 01:40:02,701
Gemma. No.

1217
01:40:06,716 --> 01:40:09,446
- Get me on that plane.
- Hang on.

1218
01:40:09,619 --> 01:40:13,020
Go. Go. Go.

1219
01:40:13,723 --> 01:40:15,588
You happy now, you big butch bastard?

1220
01:40:15,758 --> 01:40:18,852
Just go help Moe. Go help him.

1221
01:40:20,530 --> 01:40:23,260
I want you to pull me right up
next to the port side.

1222
01:40:23,433 --> 01:40:24,730
What's a port side?

1223
01:40:24,934 --> 01:40:26,799
Uh... The left side.

1224
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:28,403
- Oh, okay.
- Right next to her.

1225
01:40:42,919 --> 01:40:44,750
- Go, go, go, stay with it.
- Okay.

1226
01:40:48,858 --> 01:40:52,385
- My God, what are you doing?
- Pull right up next to the pontoon.

1227
01:41:19,589 --> 01:41:20,886
Whoa!

1228
01:41:24,861 --> 01:41:27,694
Now that's a man who loves his wife.

1229
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:35,669
That's it.

1230
01:41:36,806 --> 01:41:38,137
That's it.

1231
01:41:58,094 --> 01:41:59,118
Oh!

1232
01:42:05,968 --> 01:42:08,334
- Tess!
- Finn!

1233
01:42:16,612 --> 01:42:17,840
Tess!

1234
01:42:18,581 --> 01:42:19,673
Oh!

1235
01:42:19,849 --> 01:42:22,943
Damn, baby,
since when do you know how to fly?

1236
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:25,178
Don't. Can't.

1237
01:42:26,956 --> 01:42:31,916
Well, you're doing a great job.
I mean, we're still in the air, right?

1238
01:42:32,128 --> 01:42:33,425
Technically.

1239
01:42:34,464 --> 01:42:35,488
Oh, shit.

1240
01:42:36,699 --> 01:42:39,031
I think he hit the engine.

1241
01:42:39,769 --> 01:42:42,431
Okay. Um...

1242
01:42:42,672 --> 01:42:47,473
Wings, flaps, air speed, altitude...

1243
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:51,612
...pedals for the rudder. Check. Okay.

1244
01:42:51,781 --> 01:42:53,942
- How do you know what to do?
- You know...

1245
01:42:54,117 --> 01:42:56,017
...PlayStation. Ha-ha!

1246
01:42:58,054 --> 01:43:00,022
Oh, God.

1247
01:43:00,289 --> 01:43:01,722
- Oh, God.
- Hang on, hang on.

1248
01:43:01,891 --> 01:43:03,518
Here we go. Aah!

1249
01:43:06,896 --> 01:43:09,262
Whoo! Finn!

1250
01:43:09,799 --> 01:43:12,290
- Wow. Whoa.
- Hey, you're doing it.

1251
01:43:12,468 --> 01:43:16,802
Way to go. That's great, oh, wow.
We're flying.

1252
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:18,898
Yep.

1253
01:43:19,442 --> 01:43:20,568
How do we land?

1254
01:43:22,245 --> 01:43:23,542
Yep.

1255
01:43:25,515 --> 01:43:26,982
How'd you do it in the game?

1256
01:43:32,321 --> 01:43:37,554
I'm rich! I'm rich! I'm rich!

1257
01:43:48,471 --> 01:43:51,599
Now, honey, this next part...

1258
01:43:51,774 --> 01:43:55,141
...I'm not exactly sure how to pull off.

1259
01:43:55,578 --> 01:43:59,378
I do know that we've got to completely
stall out just before we hit the water.

1260
01:43:59,549 --> 01:44:01,210
- Stall?
- Stop flying.

1261
01:44:01,384 --> 01:44:04,615
- Stop flying?
- Yeah, and land.

1262
01:44:05,455 --> 01:44:08,288
On the nice soft... water.

1263
01:44:09,459 --> 01:44:11,893
- Are we gonna die?
- No.

1264
01:44:12,295 --> 01:44:13,990
No, we're not.

1265
01:44:18,468 --> 01:44:20,902
Oh, shit, where's Finn?

1266
01:44:21,471 --> 01:44:23,439
Probably he's flying the plane.

1267
01:44:23,606 --> 01:44:25,540
You mean there's hope?

1268
01:44:25,708 --> 01:44:28,108
Not necessarily.

1269
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:33,312
- Hey, let me just say this.
- No.

1270
01:44:35,017 --> 01:44:36,951
- Well, why not?
- Because.

1271
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:39,280
Tell me after we crash.

1272
01:44:41,524 --> 01:44:43,890
That'll give me something
to look forward to.

1273
01:44:57,139 --> 01:44:58,800
Okay.

1274
01:45:14,323 --> 01:45:15,688
One hundred.

1275
01:45:19,829 --> 01:45:22,161
We got it, baby. Eighty.

1276
01:45:23,566 --> 01:45:25,090
Sixty.

1277
01:45:28,004 --> 01:45:29,028
Forty.

1278
01:45:32,008 --> 01:45:33,703
Pull her up, boy.

1279
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:37,208
Baby, baby...

1280
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:38,870
- I love you.
- I love you.

1281
01:45:39,048 --> 01:45:40,106
Pull her up.

1282
01:45:54,297 --> 01:45:55,321
Oh, shit.

1283
01:46:13,716 --> 01:46:15,479
Finn?

1284
01:46:18,454 --> 01:46:19,887
I'm sorry.

1285
01:46:20,056 --> 01:46:23,719
I love you.
I've learned a lot from my mistakes.

1286
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,052
Marry me.

1287
01:46:25,261 --> 01:46:26,956
No...

1288
01:46:27,463 --> 01:46:29,260
...you haven't.

1289
01:46:29,765 --> 01:46:31,528
And, yes...

1290
01:46:31,701 --> 01:46:33,362
...I will.

1291
01:46:39,742 --> 01:46:40,902
Baby.

1292
01:46:41,077 --> 01:46:42,567
What?

1293
01:52:21,216 --> 01:52:23,207
ENGLISH SDH
