1
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,870
Oh, my God.

2
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,190
Oh, Frank, thank God.

3
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,630
I'm dead.

4
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,510
Frank, I'm sorry. I got lost.
This town is so confusing.

5
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,790
There's Connecticut,
Vermont, Massachusetts...

6
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,030
Man, what a day.

7
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,470
My wife had to work early,
so I took my kid to his new school.

8
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,070
He won't stop crying.

9
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,310
Says he wants
to move back to Chicago.

10
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,910
It broke my heart.

11
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,630
Any more excuses?

12
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,150
Good.

13
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,150
When you work with me,
you be punctual.

14
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,630
You got it?

15
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,390
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

16
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,310
- Come on.
- Frank, how you doing?

17
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,430
- Marty.
- Good to see you again.

18
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,470
Sorry we were late.

19
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,990
Al, could you go downstairs
and help out Jimmy and Raul?

20
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,750
- Please?
- Yeah, sure.

21
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,470
- Appreciate it.
- This is his.

22
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,830
Hi, you guys.

23
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,190
- You don't trust me.
- I live in a crappy neighborhood.

24
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,110
Yeah?

25
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,390
- Got that funny money?
- Yeah.

26
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,870
Right here.

27
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,070
Looks good.
Looks real good.

28
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,990
- We're in business.
- Excellent.

29
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,990
There’s just one problem.

30
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,470
This guy Al keeps asking me questions
about my counterfeiter.

31
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,630
- Really?
- He asked too many questions.

32
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,310
My instinct usually tells me
when there's something wrong.

33
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,750
There's something wrong here,
so I had him followed.

34
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,230
He's a fucking Secret Service agent.

35
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,270
What do you think I ought to do?

36
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,030
Make sure the body
doesn't wash up on shore.

37
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,110
I want you to pop him for me.

38
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,070
I think maybe you’re with him.

39
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,590
You came to me, remember?

40
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,790
So pop him.
Show me I'm an asshole.

41
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,630
I'm just a businessman.

42
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,590
So pop him...

43
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,670
and let's do some business.

44
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,510
Yes, that's what
I'm looking for.

45
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,750
Let's go get an omelet.
You like omelets?

46
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,910
I know a good place.
We'll have chili and cheese.

47
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,830
Let me get my pistoli.

48
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,670
My gun.

49
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,350
You're under arrest.

50
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,750
You're under arrest too.

51
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,190
Secret Service.

52
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,750
You knew the gun was empty, right?

53
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,750
You knew from the weight
of the gun...

54
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,590
that the chamber was empty?

55
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,910
- There could have been one bullet.
- Oh, my God.

56
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,790
Do you think we can go someplace
and talk about this?

57
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,270
You killed guys before?

58
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,830
- Does it get to you?
- It gets to you.

59
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,430
I don't know if I'm cut out
for this undercover stuff.

60
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,910
I was so scared.

61
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,150
You know, I joined
the Secret Service because...

62
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,310
I always wanted
to protect people.

63
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,950
The idea of throwing yourself
in front of a gun...

64
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,830
hoping the bullet hits you instead
of the guy you’re protecting...

65
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,350
You find that appealing?

66
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,910
I don't know.

67
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,510
Maybe I'm...

68
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,150
Maybe I'm just wrong
for the job.

69
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,030
You're a good man.
You'll make a good agent.

70
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,190
How do you know? This is
the longest conversation we ever had.

71
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,550
I know things about people.

72
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,590
Come on.
Let's get something to eat.

73
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,070
I want to go home,
hug my wife and kid.

74
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,110
A lot of guys warned me
you were a pain in the ass.

75
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,510
And they were right.

76
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,510
- I'll see you in the office.
- Damn. The office.

77
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,350
Monroe wanted us
to check out some wacko.

78
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,470
- I'll take care of it.
- I'll go with you.

79
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,110
You go home,
hug your wife and kid.

80
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,910
Lam not nosy lady.

81
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,950
I don't snoop,
but smoke alarm was going off.

82
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,870
I get scared.

83
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,390
I get more scared when I see
what is there inside.

84
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,710
Smoke was from crumbs
in oven left on.

85
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,110
Thirty-one years
I'm in this country.

86
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,550
I love United States.

87
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,310
I go to White House.

88
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,750
Only United States
can just anybody go...

89
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,270
to the house
of the president to visit.

90
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,910
So when I see this...

91
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,350
these killing things...

92
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,230
I call police.

93
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,150
They say they call Secret Service.

94
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,550
But two days,
you don't come.

95
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,870
The president gets approximately
1,400 threats a year, ma'am.

96
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,790
We have to check them all.

97
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,070
You say this fellow's name
is McCauley?

98
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,070
No, Joseph McCrawley
from Denver, Colorado.

99
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,750
I still remember like yesterday.

100
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,670
I cry and cry.

101
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,390
Joseph McCrawley of Denver,
right?

102
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,830
That's right.

103
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,830
Died over 30 years ago, age 11.

104
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,230
Your guy must have got himself
a duplicate birth certificate...

105
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,270
then used it
to get a driver's license.

106
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,270
- Thanks, Jack.
- See you.

107
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,950
Federal agents.
Open up.

108
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,270
Ma'am.

109
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,550
Oh, my God.

110
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,070
That's you.

111
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,910
Yeah.

112
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,710
Frank Horrigan?

113
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,150
Yeah.

114
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,230
The Secret Service agent?

115
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,270
Yeah, what did I win?

116
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,150
My God, it's really you?

117
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,190
Who the hell is this?

118
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,870
That was you
in my apartment last night.

119
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,910
McCrawley?

120
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,830
Why not call me Booth?

121
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,350
Why not Oswald?

122
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,630
Because Booth had flair,
panache...

123
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,630
the leap to the stage
after he shot Lincoln.

124
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,670
- Where are you?
- Closer than you might imagine.

125
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,070
It's very exciting to talk to you.
I feel like I know you.

126
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,630
How's that?

127
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,550
I've read about you,
seen photos.

128
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,590
You were JFK's favorite agent,
the best and the brightest.

129
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,670
But that was along time ago.

130
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,870
What's kept you in the game
all these years?

131
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,110
Why don't we get together for a drink?
We could talk about that.

132
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,310
I’d love to, but the less
you know about me the better.

133
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,990
- Why?
- I’m planning to kill the president.

134
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,030
You shouldn't have said that.

135
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,110
It's a federal offense
to threaten the president.

136
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,990
You could go to jail
even if you don't mean it.

137
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,390
I mean it, all right.

138
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,950
John F. Kennedy said
all someone needs is a willingness...

139
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,030
to trade his life
for the president's.

140
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,710
- Right?
- That's right.

141
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,150
I'm willing.

142
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,510
Going up against you...

143
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,030
raises the game
to a much higher level.

144
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,470
Fate has brought us together.

145
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,030
I just can't
get over the irony.

146
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,550
What irony?

147
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,310
You being intimately involved...

148
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,510
with the assassinations
of two presidents.

149
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,990
Hang on a second.
I got something on the stove.

150
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,310
He was only in the building
for three weeks.

151
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,070
He came and left at odd hours.

152
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,910
What's really weird is that the other
tenants noticed him on the stairs...

153
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,350
but never really saw him.

154
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,190
Depending on who you talk to
he was between 5'8"and 6'2"...

155
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,150
between 165 and 180 pounds.

156
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,710
- Age?
- Between 28 and 45.

157
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,030
Two months before an election,
you get panic on a good day.

158
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,830
- They've been waiting for you.
- Sam.

159
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,390
Been a long time
since you’ve been over here.

160
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,790
I hear the new director
isn't much fun.

161
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,990
- I've been the director for two years.
- Yeah.

162
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,870
- Al D'Andrea.
- Director.

163
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,510
- You know Matt Wilder?
- Yeah.

164
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,510
He still owes me 20 bucks
from Super Bowl XXI.

165
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,270
He always liked Denver.

166
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,670
This is Agent-in-Charge
Bill Watts.

167
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,910
- And Lilly Raines.
- Hello.

168
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,350
Secretaries get prettier
and prettier around here.

169
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,830
And the field agents
get older and older.

170
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,590
Lilly's an agent.

171
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,430
I knew that. I just wanted to see
if she had a sense of humor.

172
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,430
Have a seat.
Let's talk about this guy.

173
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,870
- I guess we're calling him Booth?
- Yeah.

174
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,710
- What do you know about him?
- Well, he's dangerous.

175
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,150
- How do you know?
- I know things about people.

176
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,870
Why didn’t you take
appropriate steps...

177
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,710
to know more that first night?

178
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,950
We had a busy day, Bill.

179
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,630
Too busy to investigate properly?

180
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,350
Your report says you were only
in the room ten minutes.

181
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,790
I didn't have a warrant.

182
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,270
Given your reputation
for undercover work...

183
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,190
- What reputation are you talking about?
- Let's get back on track.

184
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,430
- What's he referring to?
- Let's drop it.

185
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,070
Am I being paranoid
or is he busting my balls?

186
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,590
Probably a little of both.

187
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,830
Bill, there was a time around here
when I was almost as arrogant as you.

188
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,470
I don't have time for this.

189
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,630
I have to pull 75 agents
out of Miami.

190
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,350
Keep me posted, Sam.

191
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,950
- What do we do with this guy?
- We'll keep investigating.

192
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,510
Meanwhile,
you could have my phone tapped.

193
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,750
- What makes you think he'll call again?
- He'll call again.

194
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,510
He's got panache.

195
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,630
- "Panache"?
- It means flamboyance.

196
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,710
- I know what it means.
- Really?

197
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,790
- I had to look it up.
- We'll tap your phone.

198
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,750
By the way, Frank...

199
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,470
Watts is nowhere near as arrogant
as you were when you had Kennedy's ear.

200
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,030
Just what reputation
was Watts referring to?

201
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,990
You know damn well.

202
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,310
Is it because I'm considered
a borderline burnout...

203
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,790
with questionable social skills?

204
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,350
What do you want to talk to me about,
besides your reputation?

205
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,270
I want to be assigned
to the president.

206
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,430
- Protection?
- That's right.

207
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,870
After all these years?
Christ, you're a dinosaur.

208
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,830
This guy's gonna make a try,
and I've gotta be there.

209
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,790
- Watts would fight me tooth and nail.
- Then fight him back.

210
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,030
You owe it to me
after 30 years of favors.

211
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,030
If you knew how many times
I protected your job...

212
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,470
I've got to come back.

213
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,990
You really want to stand post again,
at your age?

214
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,350
Yeah.

215
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,510
I've got at least one pair
of good shoes in the closet somewhere.

216
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,030
All posts, we're stopping.
Traveler wants to work the ropes.

217
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,510
The French president's going with him.
Get a security man up here.

218
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,230
He's coming over here, look!

219
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,310
Goddamn it.

220
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,510
- Mr. President!
- Get back.

221
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,910
- What's going on here?
- Horrigan had a heart attack.

222
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,750
- Pal, you okay?
- Take it easy.

223
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,830
Get the hell out of here.
What the hell's going on?

224
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,670
I got a call
there was a cardiac case.

225
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,350
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm on my break here.

226
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,750
I get it.

227
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,670
You bastards.

228
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,590
Who's the wise guy?

229
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,110
Everybody back to work.

230
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,230
All right, who was the joker
who called those guys?

231
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,910
It may not have been a joke.
You were looking peaked out there.

232
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,910
I find out who it is,
I'll pay him back in spades.

233
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,310
How can you be sure
it was a "him"?

234
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,350
You missed my street, Al.

235
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,470
Why don’t you have a car?

236
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,550
I lived in New York a lot of years.
I like public transportation.

237
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,190
You like buses.
That's great.

238
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,830
Why make me go out of my way
every night?

239
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,630
I like your company.

240
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,950
He's a weird-looking guy,
isn't he?

241
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,310
Yeah, if he still
looks like that.

242
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,150
Pull up over here.

243
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,710
- It's a weird subculture, Al.
- Yeah.

244
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,790
I'd like you to send some field agents
to check these things...

245
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,230
ask about some wackos.

246
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,630
Sure. First thing in the morning,
I'll get on it.

247
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,830
- I'll talk to Jack about it.
- Hang on. I got the other line.

248
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,790
Yeah.

249
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,990
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine, thanks.

250
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,750
Hang on a second.
Let me get rid of the other call.

251
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,110
- You got it?
- We got it.

252
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,230
Keep him on the line
till we get the ANI.

253
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,790
- Yeah.
- Trying to trace me?

254
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,430
Why didn't I think of that?

255
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,670
You did or you’re not
the adversary I'd hoped for.

256
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,830
Speaking of which, how are you?
I was worried about you today.

257
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,350
- Why?
- In the motorcade...

258
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,470
I thought you were
gonna pass out.

259
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,590
You should get in shape
for that kind of duty.

260
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,510
Yeah, maybe you’re right.

261
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,150
By the way,
I'm watching your movie.

262
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,230
Movie?

263
00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:00,270
November, 1963. Kennedy's last days,
the arrival in Texas.

264
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,350
It must have been
exciting for you.

265
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,230
Dallas,
that morning at Love Field.

266
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,470
You all look so radiant:

267
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,670
JFK, Jackie and you.

268
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,910
You look so young and able.

269
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,070
What did happen to you that day?

270
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,110
Only one agent reacted
to the gunfire...

271
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,070
and you were closer
to Kennedy than he was.

272
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,510
You must have looked up at the window
of the Texas Book Depository...

273
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,870
but you didn't react.

274
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,830
Late at night,
when the demons come...

275
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,590
do you see the rifle
coming out of that window...

276
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,070
or do you see Kennedy's head
being blown apart?

277
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,150
If you'd reacted
to that first shot...

278
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,670
could you have gotten there
in time to stop the big bullet?

279
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,630
If you had, that could have been
your head being blown apart.

280
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,230
Do you wish you'd succeeded
or is life too precious?

281
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,270
What's done is done.

282
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,550
I have that "Esquire" magazine article
on the tenth anniversary...

283
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,230
about you and all the other agents
that were there that day.

284
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,790
So sad how your wife left you
and took your little daughter.

285
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,830
You were so forthright
about your drinking problem...

286
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,990
and the fact that
you weren't easy to live with.

287
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,990
I was so moved by your honesty.

288
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,590
The world can be
a cruel place...

289
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,150
to an honest man.

290
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:41,110
What about you, Booth?
What's your story?

291
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,870
It's an epic saga.

292
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,510
I'll talk to you again soon.

293
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,070
Nice to have a friend.

294
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,830
- Did you get him?
- We got him.

295
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,870
Go!

296
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,830
Get on the floor!

297
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,990
Get your hands
where I can see them!

298
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,750
He could have a device
that manipulates the ANI...

299
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,150
and fakes the line's identification.

300
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,230
Makes it seem like
he's calling from another number.

301
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,630
Where would he get this device?

302
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,230
He could build one if he were
knowledgeable in digital circuitry.

303
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,910
- But you can't trace the call.
- You can run a parity check.

304
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,070
If his line is wired
for digital switches.

305
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,510
You can trace the call?

306
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,030
Not if it's an old,
twisted-pair, analog line.

307
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,030
Damn it, Jack,
give a straight answer...

308
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,430
or my partner
will shoot off his foot.

309
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,430
He calls again,
you keep him on the line.

310
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,150
We'll see what we can do.
Right, Tony?

311
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,790
You might suggest to the police that
they don't knock down any more doors.

312
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,910
I'm intrigued,
but why play it for me?

313
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,030
We'd like you to consider canceling
the president's dinner tomorrow.

314
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,910
The state dinner,
at the French embassy?

315
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,670
Do you know how long it took to line up
this trip this close to the election?

316
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,150
This guy's manipulated
the phone system.

317
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,630
If he has a knowledge of explosives,
there could be problems.

318
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,670
Do your job,
there won't be any problems.

319
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,190
It's not that hard to smuggle weapons
inside an embassy.

320
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,470
You think the French want to knock off
the president? Are you nuts?

321
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,230
- They love him.
- Why does every chief of staff...

322
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,790
You have no reason to believe
this guy is any more dangerous...

323
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,190
than thousands of others
who make idle threats...

324
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,630
but you want me to alter the itinerary
of the world's most powerful man...

325
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,590
and risk offending
40 million French.

326
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,990
Isn't it possible this guy
has pushed some buttons in you?

327
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,710
Maybe you’re overreacting a little.

328
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,150
I'm just trying
to protect your boss, damn it.

329
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,790
So am I. We're trailing 12 points
in the latest polls.

330
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,590
He could be out of a job
in six weeks.

331
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,510
- He's got to be seen.
- Even if it kills him?

332
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,430
Next order of business?

333
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:31,070
How could being a dozen points down
look like good news?

334
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,630
The president
was even worse off weeks ago.

335
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,510
His aides will keep him out
with the voters as much as they can...

336
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,950
especially in the midwest.

337
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,430
Then an all-important swing
through California.

338
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,590
Ladies and gentlemen...

339
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,270
the President and the First Lady
of the United States...

340
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,750
and His Excellency,
the President of France, and his wife.

341
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,030
- Agent Raines, you look devastating.
- Thank you.

342
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,550
Good enough to eat, I might add,
if you’ll pardon the expression.

343
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,390
Every time I start
to sympathize with you...

344
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,750
you say something
that really annoys me.

345
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,590
Why sympathize?

346
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,950
The tape of that phone call,
when he mentioned your wife.

347
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,590
Ex-wife.

348
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,190
At any rate, I'm sorry.

349
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,550
It's strange that the only sympathy
I get these days...

350
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,550
is from a would-be assassin
or a woman I tend to annoy.

351
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,110
Would you care to dance?

352
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,750
Perhaps some other time.

353
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,670
I get off in a couple hours.

354
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,310
What are you looking at?

355
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,470
I was wondering
where you hide your firearm.

356
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,310
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

357
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,070
We're on final approach
to Los Angeles.

358
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,390
The temperature isabalmy76degrees.
It's a beautiful day out there.

359
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,110
Thanks for flying with us.
We look forward to seeing you again.

360
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,950
I'd like to deposit this
in the new account.

361
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,110
I'll need to see
your corporate resolutions.

362
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,470
Microspan Corporation.

363
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,510
- What kind of business are you in?
- Software.

364
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,750
- Up in San Jose.
- Yes.

365
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,590
Based there, but I'm opening
an office here in Los Angeles.

366
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,830
I like San Jose.

367
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,390
- Are you from there?
- No.

368
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,990
- Where are you from?
- Minneapolis.

369
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,750
You're kidding.
So am I.

370
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,830
Wow, it's a small world.

371
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,150
I hated the winters.

372
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,590
Nine months of the year
I'd stay indoors and pig out.

373
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,150
I moved here and have lost
30 pounds so far.

374
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,470
- What high school did you go to?
- New Brighton High School.

375
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,790
There isn't any
New Brighton High School.

376
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,710
There was when I was there.

377
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,870
Maybe I'm just confused.

378
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,870
It happens a lot.

379
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,990
What was the name of that high school
on Third just across from...

380
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,310
I'm sorry, but I'm very late
for a meeting. Will this take long?

381
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,390
Not at all.
Just another minute.

382
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,070
Thank you.

383
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,590
You have a very pleasant way
about you.

384
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,270
Thank you, Mr. Carney.

385
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:38,150
Agent Raines, how would you like
to give a colleague a ride home?

386
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,190
Why do you keep flirting with me?

387
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,430
Am I flirting with you?

388
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,990
You know it can't possibly go anywhere,
so why keep doing it?

389
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,870
Maybe it's because I know
it can't possibly go anywhere.

390
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,870
Give me a lift.
I'll buy you an ice cream.

391
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,350
No further obligations.

392
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,550
Oh, boy.

393
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,190
I’ve never worked
with a female agent before.

394
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:02,030
- How many are there?
- About 125.

395
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,430
- Pure window dressing.
- Excuse me?

396
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,630
Window dressing.

397
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,990
About 125
out of a little over 2,000.

398
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,230
They have you all around
so the president can look good...

399
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,910
to his feminist voters.

400
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,390
Do you make an effort
to be obnoxious or is it a gift?

401
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,190
It's a gift.

402
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,270
Half the things we do
are window dressing.

403
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,350
Take running alongside
that limousine.

404
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,310
It'd take an antitank missile
to put a dent in that damn thing.

405
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,830
There we are out for show...

406
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,710
trying to make the president
look more presidential.

407
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,710
If I'm here to court
the feminist vote...

408
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,070
what demographics
do you represent?

409
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,470
Let's see.

410
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,150
White, piano-playing heterosexuals
over the age of50.

411
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,190
There ain't a whole lot of us,
but we do have a powerful lobby.

412
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,510
Well, time flies
when you're being annoyed.

413
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,030
- Where are you going?
- I have a date.

414
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,470
- With whom?
- That's none of your business.

415
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,830
You want a ride?

416
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,590
I don't think so.

417
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,470
I like it here this time of day.
I'll hang out.

418
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:19,390
Thanks for the ice cream.
See you.

419
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,830
You're welcome.

420
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,070
If she looks back,
that means she's interested.

421
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,390
Come on now,
give me a little look.

422
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,550
One little glance back.

423
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,750
Give me that smug look
and be on your way.

424
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,670
Well, Abe...

425
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,550
Damn, I wish I could have
been there for you, pal.

426
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,550
Hi, baby.
How are you doing?

427
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,590
Come on up here. Give me a kiss.
That's a good boy.

428
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,670
Yes, I missed you too.

429
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,070
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

430
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,470
- I got your address from the phone book.
- But I'm not listed.

431
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:29,150
Uh-oh.
I suppose I better come clean.

432
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,110
I followed you.

433
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,550
I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at this.

434
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,750
I'm new in town.

435
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:40,110
I was wondering if you would care
to join me for dinner tonight.

436
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,030
That's very sweet, but I...

437
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,390
And I also wanted to apologize
for lying to you this afternoon.

438
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,270
We both know
I'm not from Minneapolis.

439
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,670
I shouldn't ask so many questions.

440
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,230
Did you mention
our conversation...

441
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:58,990
to anyone at the bank
this afternoon?

442
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,150
May I?

443
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,630
Rory, settle down!

444
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,630
Pam, what's going on?
Hi.

445
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,030
This is my roommate.
Sally, this is Mr. Carney.

446
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,790
Call me Jim.
How do you do?

447
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,470
Nice to meet you.
I was just on my way out.

448
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:23,230
I'm afraid I can't let you ladies
leave this evening.

449
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,310
What?

450
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,550
You shouldn't have been
from Minneapolis.

451
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,230
Look, I don't know
what you want, but...

452
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,470
- Hi, this is Sally.
- And this is Pam.

453
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,870
We're either out having fun
or we're asleep.

454
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,590
So leave your name and number
and we’ll call you back.

455
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,030
Bye.

456
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:12,030
Frank, I hope you don't mind me
calling you at the office.

457
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,110
I was in the neighborhood.

458
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,910
No, why don't you drop by?

459
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,630
I’d love to.

460
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,430
Let me take some time to welcome
those who are joining us late.

461
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,630
I’d love to drop by.
I'd like it a lot.

462
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,750
We've got so much in common.

463
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,870
We do? Like what?

464
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,830
We’re both willing to trade
our lives for the president.

465
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,110
We're both honest
and capable men...

466
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,550
who were betrayed
by people we trusted.

467
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,150
- I wasn't betrayed, Booth.
- Sure you were.

468
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,710
The Warren Commission's report
on the assassination...

469
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,510
They called your procedure
"seriously deficient".

470
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,830
They criticized you
and the other agents...

471
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,390
who were out drinking late
the night before...

472
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,910
as though Kennedy would be a live today
if you'd been in bed at 10:00 p.m.

473
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,510
That's ludicrous.

474
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,150
Maybe they were right.

475
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,870
As a matter of fact,
they weren't right.

476
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,870
You wanted to station agents
on his bumpers and sideboards.

477
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,590
He refused. Do you know why
I think he refused?

478
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,430
I think he refused
because he had a death wish.

479
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,710
He talked all the time
about being assassinated.

480
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,390
His favorite poem was
"I Have a Rendezvous with Death"...

481
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,910
which is not a good poem.

482
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,830
I think he wanted to die.

483
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,350
I think he didn’t care that his death
would ruin your life.

484
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,750
I think he was a selfish bastard.

485
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,190
But what do you think?

486
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,310
What about you?
Who betrayed you?

487
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,790
I don't think he's scrambling it.

488
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,550
Some of the same people.

489
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:52,310
But I'm gonna get even.
I’ll have my day in the sun.

490
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,550
The question is:
Will you have yours?

491
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,870
- It's coming.
- You're in for a lot more pain.

492
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,110
How much of this shit
do I have to listen to?

493
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,390
Jesus!

494
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,830
He's right across the street:
Lafayette Park. Keep him on.

495
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,230
Are you guys crazy?

496
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,350
Do you see somebody over there?

497
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,070
I told you to get in shape.

498
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,310
This is your current address?

499
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,150
And you didn't see anybody suspicious
hanging around that phone booth?

500
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,590
That's him.

501
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,350
Secret Service.
I'm impounding this car.

502
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:57,950
He put his hand down here.
We got fingerprints.

503
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,430
You all right?

504
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,990
- Tony.
- Yeah?

505
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,830
Have a look at this.

506
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,710
- This the print from Secret Service?
- Yeah.

507
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,590
Something strange here.

508
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,270
Shit. It's a C-12.
We can't tell them.

509
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,590
- I'm afraid that we've drawn a blank.
- You sure?

510
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,470
We ran that print
against everything we've got.

511
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,950
What do we do now?

512
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,030
I'm leaving with the president
in the morning.

513
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,070
- You keep investigating.
- What should I do?

514
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,390
You're an adult human being.
Think of something.

515
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,310
You're a real pain in the ass
when things don't go your way.

516
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,910
Your friends warned you about that.

517
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,190
The president
hit the campaign trail today.

518
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,150
He left
from Andrews Air Force Base...

519
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,950
on a whirlwind tour of 12 states
over the next six days.

520
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,270
With just over a month to go
before the election...

521
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:04,190
the president is trailing
his opponent by ten points.

522
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:07,550
To close that gap, he’ll concentrate
his campaign efforts in the midwest...

523
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,310
where he's sagging in the polls.

524
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,630
The campaign swing will windup
in Chicago with a big rally.

525
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,190
The president’s campaign staff
is hopeful that by that time...

526
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,110
Reservations, Donna Lynn.
May I help you?

527
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,990
I'm calling to find out when
you would have a flight on Tuesday...

528
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,870
from Washington to Los Angeles?

529
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,310
All right.

530
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,710
If possible, I'd like to get
an open-ended ticket...

531
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:31,590
because I may have to make some stops
in the midwest on my return.

532
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,470
Denver Command Post, C-5 Agents.

533
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,030
We'll off-load the choppers first.
Who's our route agent?

534
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,350
C-5Agent,
that will be Jack McKeen.

535
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:43,630
Denver Command Post, Watts.
We have arrival: 1315.

536
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:47,390
C-5Agent, where are we keeping
these cars secured?

537
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,590
Denver Police Department
has a fenced area for us.

538
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,630
Security Room, Watts.
We're ten minutes out. Situation report.

539
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:57,790
Here in Denver, we gather today
in the shadow of giants:

540
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:01,470
Brave pioneers who overcame
terrifying obstacles...

541
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,470
to carve a new nation
from a wilderness.

542
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,710
Today we are asked to match
our vision to their vision...

543
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,470
and to pass that legacy
of a boundless...

544
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,030
Horrigan to I D.
Sector three secured?

545
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,030
Sector three is secure.

546
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,310
A legacy of tolerance...

547
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,230
The president campaigning today
in Denver.

548
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,590
Here in Washington this afternoon,
the Senate again delayed action...

549
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:38,990
We are living in a time
of global economic transition.

550
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:44,070
We need compassion and vision
to create a future...

551
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:48,110
of peace and progress
for every American.

552
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:51,230
That was the president
stumping in Nebraska today.

553
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,950
He's due to arrive here in Los Angeles
later in the month...

554
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,590
to compete for California’s crucial
54 electoral votes.

555
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,590
Hi, Sandy Riggs calling
for James Carney.

556
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,310
If you're serious
about trying to catch a rally...

557
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,030
while you’re in the midwest,
you best call me.

558
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:27,230
The president's schedule changes
hour by hour.

559
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,990
In answer
to your other question...

560
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,550
just send a check here
to party headquarters.

561
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:34,350
Thanks again.
I'm looking forward to meeting you.

562
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,830
Ladies and gentlemen
of Holland, Michigan...

563
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:39,550
the President
of the United States!

564
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,790
We've gone a long way
toward achieving that goal...

565
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,710
but there's a lot left to do.

566
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,950
Watts, Flynn. We got some trouble
on the tracks up ahead.

567
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,030
You better notify
the White House staff.

568
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,350
Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.
We've only got one site.

569
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,390
May I have your attention, please?

570
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:07,550
Flight318 to Milwaukee
is now boarding at Gate 21.

571
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,630
Please have
your boarding passes ready.

572
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,550
All passengers should proceed
to the boarding area now.

573
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,350
Checking.

574
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:24,190
Found any bombs today?

575
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,710
- Agent Raines.
- Agent Horrigan.

576
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,270
How's the first lady?
Did she ask about me?

577
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,030
Have you gotten to know them yet?

578
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,910
I prefer not to get to know
the people I'm protecting.

579
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,510
Why is that?

580
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,270
You might decide they're
not worth taking a bullet for.

581
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,390
Here comes my replacement.

582
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,670
- Care to join me in the bar?
- We can't drink on the road.

583
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,390
Of course not, but they've got
a hell of a piano player.

584
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:02,910
I've played for presidents,
and I've played with presidents.

585
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:07,070
Nixon and I once did
a halfway decent duet of "Moon glow".

586
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,950
I heard he didn't like you.

587
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,870
That's not true.
We got on all right.

588
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,750
His chief of staff
was another matter.

589
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,350
Once at a rally in Boston...

590
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:19,550
he ordered me to get rid
of some antiwar protesters.

591
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:24,150
I said I couldn't do that.
Freedom of speech, that kind of stuff.

592
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,710
He said, "When I'm talking to you,
I am the president".

593
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:32,350
And I said, "You look more like
a sack of shit in a cheap suit, sir".

594
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,830
I like the "sir".
It's a classy touch.

595
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,950
- I thought so.
- Mm-hmm.

596
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,590
So how come you never wear shades
standing post?

597
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,470
I like the wackos to see
the whites of my eyes.

598
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,870
A good glare can be
just as effective as a gun.

599
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,270
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

600
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:17,230
You got me.

601
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:20,350
You better stick
to the shades, sweetheart.

602
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,510
Agent Raines,
what are you afraid of?

603
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,030
Afraid of making a big mistake.

604
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,230
Good night.

605
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,190
We're looking at this route
to the hospital...

606
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,950
Oh, good.

607
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,390
We've got some updates
on Milwaukee tomorrow.

608
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,830
Thanks.

609
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:55,590
Call Advance and see
if we can get a backup route.

610
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,030
- Don't answer it.
- Shit.

611
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:49,470
Traveler's lost ground in Georgia,
so Milwaukee's off.

612
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:53,150
They're staging a rally outside Atlanta
in a town called Woodstock.

613
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,870
We need you down at Communications,
right away.

614
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,790
I'll be right down.

615
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:07,870
Traveler's losing ground in Georgia,
so Milwaukee's out tomorrow.

616
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,550
And they're staging a rally
somewhere outside Atlanta.

617
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,790
Damn.

618
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,230
Oh, dear.

619
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,350
What am I doing?

620
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,270
Shit. Ow.

621
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,790
Oh, boy.

622
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,190
Damn.

623
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:39,990
I gotta put all that shit back on,
goddamn it.

624
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,390
Please open your purses
for inspection.

625
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:51,630
You don't know how glad I am to see you
all out in the rain with me today.

626
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,430
I've been going around saying...

627
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:57,470
"Don’t just vote for me,
join me".

628
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,310
Today you certainly have.

629
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:03,310
We may feel a tad damp today...

630
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:07,390
but guess who’s going to be all wet
on election day?

631
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,430
What about the watch list?

632
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,670
I've got 23 regional crazies
under surveillance.

633
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,750
Chicago intelligence has nine more.

634
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:24,350
- The hospital?
- St. Ann's.

635
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,070
Extra units of Traveler's
blood type on hand.

636
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,950
Accessible to that
alternative route as well.

637
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,190
ETA Chicago: Ten minutes.

638
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,750
- Under the weather?
- Sick as a dog.

639
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:46,150
Yeah? What's this?

640
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,790
"Psychological Profile
of John Booth".

641
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:52,350
- Did you make a mistake?
- What?

642
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,750
You said you were afraid
of making a big mistake.

643
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:05,630
Let's be realistic. This job
is not like we work in a bank.

644
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,950
You had an affair with an agent,
and it came out badly.

645
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,870
He wasn't an agent.

646
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:15,510
He left you because you wouldn't quit.
You were brokenhearted.

647
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:20,310
I left him because I wouldn't
quit my job for him.

648
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:22,230
It did break my heart.

649
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:27,710
You vowed to never let a man
come between you and your career.

650
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:34,710
Except now you’re in love with me,
and it scares you a little.

651
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,470
Blow your nose. Here.

652
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:38,910
Sorry.

653
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,430
What were to happen
if I gave up my job for you?

654
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:54,230
Why would you do that?

655
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,630
Maybe I vowed
to never let my career...

656
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,150
come between me and a woman.

657
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,990
- Yeah?
- Be careful, will you?

658
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:16,990
This whole event tonight has been
advertised in advance. Just be alert.

659
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:32,830
This is Horrigan.
It's a zoo out here.

660
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,790
It's not very secure.
We've got to take Traveler underground.

661
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:37,790
All posts, this is Watts.

662
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:41,070
We're using the alternate
arrival site: Underground.

663
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,470
Horrigan to Watts.
I think Booth may be here.

664
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,870
I thought
you couldn't identify him.

665
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:01,790
I can't.
Just call it a hunch.

666
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:05,310
With all due respect to your psychic
abilities, we’ll stick to the game plan.

667
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:07,230
All posts, take your positions.

668
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:12,030
- You've got a fever.
- Just stay alert in there.

669
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:22,710
There is one quality above all
that marks this president.

670
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:26,390
It has earned him the affection
of every working man and woman.

671
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,270
- Give us our president!
- That quality is courage!

672
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,750
The question to us is:

673
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:37,310
Will we stand by the man...

674
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:40,030
who has stood by us?

675
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:43,350
- Post check. Stage right?
- Stage right all clear.

676
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:45,990
- Stage left?
- Stage left clear.

677
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,590
- Stage center?
- Stage center clear.

678
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:54,910
- Mezzanine left?
- Mezzanine left all clear.

679
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:58,110
The President of the United States
and the First Lady.

680
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,310
Gun!

681
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:38,990
Get down!

682
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,390
Get these people
out of here!

683
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,990
Hold all radio traffic.

684
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:55,470
Security room.
What the hell's going on in there?

685
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,590
I'm all clear.

686
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:02,150
False alarm.

687
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:05,750
Traveler's secure.
All posts resume positions.

688
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,470
- You all right, Mr. President?
- I'm all right.

689
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:13,150
Everything's all right, folks.
Everything will be just fine.

690
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,870
We had a little false alarm there.

691
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:19,830
Wasn't that exciting?

692
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:22,750
Take your seats, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

693
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,590
Security Room, Raines.

694
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,230
It was just a balloon popping.
All clear.

695
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,150
Traveler wants to continue.

696
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:54,630
Do you have any idea
how many votes you cost us last night?

697
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:57,910
The president came off looking
like a coward on national television.

698
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,550
He came off all right.

699
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,470
You were the one that
looked like the damn coward.

700
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:03,790
This is a joke to you?

701
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:06,150
No, you're a joke to me, Harry.

702
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:08,790
- You have no idea what we do here.
- That's enough!

703
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:12,350
You call me Harry again, you'll be
busting counterfeiters in Alaska.

704
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,630
You keep him away from the president,
away from the White House...

705
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:17,550
and you sure better
keep him away from me!

706
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,870
You don't talk
to the chief of staff like that!

707
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:24,230
- I don't work for him.
- No, you work for me. You did.

708
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,910
You're off my detail.

709
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:37,150
My Super Bowl debt.

710
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,110
In case I don't see you
after this trip.

711
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:52,510
You know, if you were just
to acknowledge...

712
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:54,590
that it was
an unfortunate situation...

713
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,630
I won't apologize
for doing my job.

714
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:58,910
I'm not saying you should...

715
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:01,310
but the president was humiliated.

716
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:02,910
He's alive, isn't he?

717
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:05,470
We're here to safeguard
his dignity as well.

718
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:06,990
I'm not paid for that.

719
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:10,510
What about the time Kennedy's girlfriend
was caught in the White House...

720
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,750
and you said she was with you?

721
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,550
Don't believe every rumor
someone tells you.

722
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:20,590
Wilder told me
the whole story...

723
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:23,350
about how you were
suspended a month without pay.

724
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,750
I'd say that was
safeguarding his dignity.

725
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:28,430
That was different.
He was different.

726
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,190
Maybe you were different.

727
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,670
I was different.

728
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,070
The whole damn country was different.

729
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:35,670
Everything would be different
right now too...

730
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,990
if I'd been half as paranoid
as I am today.

731
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,430
Fuck.

732
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:02,670
Why not just retire, Frank?

733
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,230
Live off your pension.

734
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,950
I mean, what's the point?

735
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:10,910
Somebody else asked me that
not long ago.

736
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,350
Hell, you don't spend any money
on anything except jazz records.

737
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:17,630
I want to stay
on the Booth case.

738
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,070
All right.

739
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:26,390
- As for protective detail, I can't...
- I understand.

740
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:37,350
That thing in Chicago...
I just don't understand.

741
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:39,990
I've never been on the wrong side
of a judgment call like that.

742
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,390
You had the flu,
for Christ's sake.

743
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,790
It's been known
to impair judgment.

744
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:47,870
Face it.

745
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,550
You're too old for this shit.

746
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:47,910
- Hello.
- What happened in the Windy City?

747
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:54,270
The balloon get you
in a little panic?

748
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:59,440
- You were there?
- Yes, I was.
