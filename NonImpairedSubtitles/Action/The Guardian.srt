00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,343
<i>There's a legend</i>
<i>of a man who lives beneath the sea.</i>

2
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,313
<i>He is a fisher of men,</i>

3
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:52,278
<i>the last hope of all those</i>
<i>who have been left behind.</i>

4
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:55,879
<i>Many survivors claim to have felt</i>
<i>his gripping hands beneath them,</i>

5
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,889
<i>pushing them up to the surface,</i>

6
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,120
<i>whispering strength</i>
<i>until help could arrive.</i>

7
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,527
<i>But this, of course, is only a legend.</i>

8
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,867
Help!

9
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,002
Over here!

10
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,369
Sherilyn!

11
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,568
Help!

12
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,580
Ma'am, I'm a Coast Guard
rescue swimmer.

13
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,172
I'm here to help you.

14
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,854
Sir, stay with your flotation.
I'll be back for you.

15
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,981
- Don't leave me!
- Just stay there.

16
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,116
Don't you leave me!

17

<i>Basket is outside</i>

<i>Swimmer and survivor</i>

24
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,175
Put your head in first.

25
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,214
I gotta get out!

26
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,511
<i>Easy, forward.</i>

27
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,048
Let go! Let go.

28
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,722

<i>We're taking the load.</i>

33
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,143
<i>Whoa, big wave.</i>

34
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,680
Get out! Get out!
What's wrong with you?

35
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,416
Sit there and shut up.

36
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,437
<i>Swimmer in sight.</i>

37
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,545
<i>Prepare to take the load.</i>

38
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,608
<i>I have the ready-for-pickup signal.</i>

39
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,655
<i>Swimmer is approaching cabin door.</i>

40
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,232
<i>Survivor looks unconscious.</i>

41
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,994
<i>Swimmer inside the cabin door.</i>

42
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,334
<i>Cabin door closing.</i>

43
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,284
I think you just broke my nose.

44
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,019
And you may have killed your wife, sir.

45
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,259
<i>Twenty minutes to Kodiak.</i>

46
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,094
<i>Roger.</i>
<i>He's giving her CPR.</i>

47
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,962
<i>Comstate Kodiak,</i>
<i>this is Coast Guard 6096.</i>

48
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,663
<i>We have</i>
<i>two hypothermic survivors onboard.</i>

49
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,762
<i>We'll be there in 20 minutes.</i>

50
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,865
<i>Requesting to have an ambulance</i>
<i>on-scene when we land.</i>

51
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,126
Whoa, there we go.

52
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,958
- <i>Got her?</i>
- Got her!

53
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,274
Attaway, baby.

54
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,951
There's dead,

55
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,885
then there's dead.

56
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,421
I swear,
you get better with age.

57
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,854
- Had to hit him, huh?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,223
You are not. You stay over there!
You stay over there!

59
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,290
Seems like it's always the big ones
that crack.

60
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,461
Lieutenant.

61
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,200
Crew said that she went under.
They thought you'd lost her.

62
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,666
Lucky guess.

63
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,709
Luck, my ass.

64
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,100
- I didn't think you were serious.
- Of course you didn't, Ben.

65
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,831
How could you possibly think
I was serious?

66
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,100
I'm not some nameless
drowning victim.

67
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:19,110
Oh, gee, I'm sorry saving lives
doesn't jive with our social...

68
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,602
That's...

69
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,876
That's my chair.

70
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,010
Oh, he's right. Not that chair.

71
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,753
I'm sorry. I was just pointing things out
in the living room. He didn't know.

72
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,623
I would never take your chair.

73
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,665
Pick it up, would...

74
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,269
Doesn't have to be messy, Ben.

75
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,778
It's clean, simple for both of us.
We don't have kids.

76
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,950
Well, what about Friday?

77
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,717
What about Friday?

78
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,222
We were gonna go
with Carl and Bridget, you know,

79
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,657
to that dinner-dance thing at the base.

80
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,788
The base? All-you-can-eat wings?

81
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:15,459
A dart game to settle the tab?
That's the date that we can't break?

82
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,628
- You're right. You're right.
- Wow.

83
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,935
Look, we'll... We'll go away, all right?
Just us.

84
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,735
It's too late, Ben.

85
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,608
I don't know what I can say to you
that I haven't said already.

86
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,113
It's time for me to rescue myself.

87
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,253
Maybe... Maybe I should be the one
to move out.

88
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,417
<i>Hi, you've reached Helen.</i>

89
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,619
<i>And Ben.</i>

90
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,718
<i>Leave a message.</i>

91
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,922
You don't even know where anything is
in this house.

92
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,157
It's much easier this way.

93
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,700
<i>Senior Chief, please report to base.</i>

94
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,829
I can... I can fix this, all right? I...

95
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,573
I can...

96
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,834
I can fix this.

97
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,548
Just tell me what to do.

98
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,978
Tell me what to do.

99
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,085
- Just let me go.
- No.

100
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,225
- Just let me go.
- No.

101
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,371
You should answer that.

102
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,610
<i>Ready rescue helo 6096.</i>
<i>Swimmer One, return to base.</i>

103
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,577
- I don't wanna lose her.
- Then change.

104
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,311
Ben, how many times
have we had this conversation?

105
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:43,412
The only way for you to save it
is to give this up and fly a desk.

106
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,121
Exactly. She just wants to live.

107
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,627
Hey, maybe we can get a hobby.
Both of us.

108
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,165
Something like fishing.

109
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,794
- Fishing?
- Yeah.

110
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,234
Guys like us don't fish, Carl.

111
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,465
It'll work out. Always does.

112
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,967
Let me ask you something, seriously.
Is it too soon for me to ask her out?

113
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,475
I guess so.

114
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,450
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>
<i>Mayday!</i>

115
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,509
<i>This is cargo vessel</i> Seaqueen.

<i>We're taking on water.</i>

119
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,662
We're abandoning ship.
I repeat, abandoning ship.

120
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,206
Son, look at me. Look at me.
You're gonna be okay. Got that?

121
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,404
Got that? We're gonna be okay.

122
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,570
Okay.

123
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,656

- <i>No.</i>

- <i>Forty minutes to bingo.</i>

128
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,372
- <i>All right, take the stick.</i>
- <i>Okay, I have the controls.</i>

129
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,842
<i>All right, huddle time, boys.</i>

00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,983
<i>Well, how about fathers and sons?</i>

156
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:05,048
<i>Flare! Flare! We got a live one here.</i>
<i>We got a live one!</i>

157
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,059
<i>You got five minutes,</i>
<i>then we're hauling your ass back up.</i>

158
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,257
<i>Kodiak Ops,</i>
<i>this is Coast Guard 6096.</i>

159
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,766
<i>We have people in the water,</i>
<i>and we are deploying our swimmer.</i>

160
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,996
6096, Kodiak Ops, copy.

161
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,504
<i>One's holding the flare.</i>
<i>I see no other movement.</i>

162
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,597
<i>Roger that.</i>

163
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,971
<i>Swimmer's ready to deploy.</i>

164
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,102
- <i>Check swimmer.</i>
- <i>Roger. Checking swimmer.</i>

165
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,411
<i>Swimmer's dressed out.</i>
<i>Checklist is complete.</i>

166
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,952
<i>Five minutes.</i>

167
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,350
<i>Swimmer's away.</i>

168
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,157
<i>Swimmer's okay.</i>

169
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,465
- <i>Clear to move back and left 30.</i>
- <i>Clear back and left.</i>

170
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,923
<i>How we looking</i>
<i>on fuel there?</i>

171
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,222
<i>Two minutes to bingo.</i>

172
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,697
I'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer
here to help you, son.

173
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,467
You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you in that helicopter.

174
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,077
- <i>I have the ready-for-pickup signal.</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

175
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,118
<i>Basket is going out the cabin door.</i>

176
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,988
<i>Bingo. We're at bingo. Gotta go.</i>

177
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,390
<i>Ease it back.</i>

178
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,424
- <i>Basket is in the water!</i>
- <i>We're out of time. We gotta go, Carl.</i>

179
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,558
<i>Hold position. Steady. Hold.</i>

180
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,499
<i>He's putting the survivor in the basket.</i>

181
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,299
<i>Your rad alt's going crazy.</i>

182
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,204
<i>Yeah, yeah, I know.</i>
<i>I'm all over the place.</i>

183
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,743
<i>Come on, Carl, we gotta go now!</i>

184
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,078
<i>I don't have</i>
<i>a ready-for-pickup signal yet.</i>

185
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,020
Whoa! Carl! Behind you!

186
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,419
<i>Holy shit!</i>

187
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,252
<i>We lost our tail rotor!</i>

188
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,531
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

189
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,665
<i>Coast Guard 6096 is going down!</i>

190
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,967
<i>Mayday! Mayday! 6096 is going in.</i>

191
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,879
Carl. I'm here.

192
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:21,942
Carl.

193
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,024
Hold on, Carl. Hold on.

194
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,451
They'll be coming for us.

195
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,723
I got you. You're okay now.

196
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,798
You're okay. I'm here, Carl.

197
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,897
We're okay. Hang on. I got you.

198
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,670
- You think they're coming?
- Oh, yeah, they're coming.

199
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,813
I want a C-130
over that crash site now.

200
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,819
Lieutenant Krauss,
start the mishap checklist.

201
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:55,876
Aye, Captain.

202
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,786
Captain, I've got an EPIRB hit
on Randall's survivor suit.

203
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,847
Launch ready helos. Swimmer provide.

204
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,088
We have a C-130 coming off a case
off Attu. It's already low on fuel.

205
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,595
I don't care. Have them cut an engine.

206
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,255
I want him to know
he's not alone out there.

207
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,796
Listen. Listen.

208
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,431
You hear that?

209
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,883
Hold on, Carl.
Here we go, Carl. I got you.

210
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,395
What's the ETA on the backup helo?

211
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,489
Helo's en route to Cold Bay.

212
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,295
They should be on-scene,
three, maybe four hours.

213
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,392
Make it three.

214
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,446
Jesus. How much more of that stuff
do you think I got in me?

215
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,745
Feel that?

216
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,890
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

217
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,984
That means you're alive.
I'm not gonna let go.

218
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,731
- Don't you!
- I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna.

219
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,012
serious fractures,
like in the C-spine,

220
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,488
which could cause paralysis.

221
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,118
Mostly what we see is old fractures
in the arms, also in the leg,

222
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,061
but nothing acute.
Nothing new with this injury, luckily.

223
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,626
We just hope the kidneys kick in

224
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,997
and start to help him
resolve a lot of that fluid.

225
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,592
Thank you very much.

226
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,305
We've been friends a long time,
haven't we?

227
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,403
I've always been good to you,
haven't I?

228
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,711
Didn't promote you to a desk when
you turned 40 like everybody else.

229
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,807
That's right.

230
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,945
All right,
so now I need you to listen to me.

231
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,147
Okay.

232
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,658
There's an instructor opening
at "A" School, that...

233
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,921
No. The answer is no.

234
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,327
You just said you'd listen. Sit down.

235
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,765
I'm not interested, Captain.

236
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,291
Well, it's no longer a request,
Senior Chief. Sit down.

237
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,894
You're serious?

238
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,546
You have two choices.

239
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,879
Sign the papers today and you can
live life as a civilian here in Kodiak,

240
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,680
if that's what you want.

241
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,914
Or you can take that "A" School
opening I'm offering you.

242
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,924
I've already spoken to command
down there.

243
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,893
It will be your class.
You will be in charge.

244
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,760
You can take the time
to work your way back into shape.

245
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,059
I am in shape.

246
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,125
God damn it,
that's not what I'm talking about.

247
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,206
Ben, all I'm asking is that
you go down there for a few months.

248
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,834
You work with the kids, you recharge.

249
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,471
Download that epic résumé
where it's gonna do some good.

250
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,243
You can't always be
the one in the water, Ben.

251
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,914
You'll know
when you're ready to come back.

252
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,631
You people got 15 seconds
to get off this bus.

253
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,572
Move! Move! Let's go! Get off the bus!

254
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,381
Hurry up.
Let's go, let's go.

255
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,489
Put your white books
in your red bags.

256
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,455
Let's get that squared away now.
Put those books away.

257
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,933
Females,
grab your bags, fall out to the rear.

258
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,993
Follow Chief Flight
and Petty Officer Hall.

259
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,801
The rest of you, pick a bunk,
put on your ODUs.

260
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,342
You started with 15 minutes,
you are now down to 12.

261
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,402
Move! Move, move, move!

262
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,112
Move it out. Get changed
out of those working blues.

263
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,912
Hurry up. Move it out.

264
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,112
Find your rack. Quit wasting my time.

265
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,486
Hey. Hey! That's my stuff, man.

266
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,885
Hey, that's his bunk.

267
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,255
You two a couple?

268
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,124
It's okay. I like the top better anyway.

269
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,230
<i>Out of the 39,000</i>
<i>men and women</i>

270
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,135
<i>who make up</i>
<i>the United States Coast Guard,</i>

271
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,141
<i>there are only 280 rescue swimmers.</i>

272
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,540
Let's go! Let's go, mermaids!

273
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,601
<i>This is because</i>
<i>we are the Coast Guard's elite.</i>

274
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,544
<i>We are the best of the best.</i>

275
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,947
<i>When storms shut down entire ports,</i>
<i>we go out.</i>

276
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,876
<i>When hurricanes ground</i>
<i>the United States Navy, we go out.</i>

277
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,549
<i>And when the holy Lord himself</i>
<i>reaches down from heaven</i>

278
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:43,560
and destroys his good work with winds
that rip houses off the ground,

279
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,727
we go out.

280
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,327
And the attrition rate at this school
is well over 50%.

281
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:55,066
So if by some miracle you actually
have what it takes to become one of us,

282
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,575
then you get to live a life of meager pay

283
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:03,774
with the distinct possibility
of dying slow, cold and alone

284
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,673
somewhere in the vast sea.

285
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,152
However, you also get the chance
to save lives,

286
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,490
and there is no greater calling
in the world than that.

287
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,962
So, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
Welcome to "A" School.

288
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,589
Are there any questions?

289
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,736
Captain, Airman Fischer.
Just have one question.

290
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,030
That guy who holds all them records,
is he still alive?

291
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,537
Why do you ask?

292
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,135
I just thought you ought to let him know

293
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,975
I'm about to knock his name
off that board.

294
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,447
Really?
Why don't you let him know yourself?

295
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,975
He's standing right behind you
in the back of the room.

296
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,756
Class, turn around
and greet Senior Chief Ben Randall.

297
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:51,287
Senior Chief Randall will be your
lead instructor for the next 18 weeks.

298
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,992
Senior Chief Randall is one of
the most decorated rescue swimmers

299
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,160
in the history
of the United States Coast Guard.

300
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,366
Ben, would you care
to address the class?

301
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,376
No, I think there's been enough talk
for one day.

302
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,106
Chief Skinner, they're all yours.

303
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,080
Attention on deck.

304
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,082
- Carry on.
- Aye, Captain.

305
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,183
PT test begins at 0700 tomorrow.

306
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,484
Class dismissed.
You will file through the front door.

307
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,081
First row first, followed by the second.

308
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,625
Frank.

309
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,792
"When God rips houses
off the ground"?

310
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,456
I was rolling.

311
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,595
And I didn't mean
to put you on the spot up there.

312
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,339
And I was real sorry
to hear about your crew.

313
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,104
Come on. I'll show you around.

314
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,071
- So I hear you're staying in a single?
- Yeah.

315
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,181
Helen's got some family business
she's gotta take care of up there.

316
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,854
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday!</i>

317
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,951
<i>This is</i> Ballmariner! Ballmariner!

318
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,725
<i>We are on fire! We are on fire!</i>

319
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,510
Go!

320
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,555
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Let's go, logs.

321
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,915
Let's move it out! Let's move it out!

322
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,290
Work as a team! Work as a team!

323
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,187
- Two lines.
- Two lines.

324
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,561
- Two lines.
- Two lines.

325
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,418
Do you understand me?

326
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,853
Yes, Petty Officer Hall.

327
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,551
Very well, let's try it. Lean and rest!

328
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,319
Pop tall.

329
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,921
Oorah!

330
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,464
- What the hell was that?
- That was terrible.

331
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,521
That was the worst
I've ever seen.

332
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,589
That was terrible.

333
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,158
Let's try that again.

334
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,273
Twenty-two.
Come on!

335
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,610
- Up!
- Twenty-three.

336
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,048
Down. Up.

337
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,176
- Twenty-four.
- Get that ass down, Cable!

338
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,618
- Up!
- Twenty-five.

339
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,215
That is absolutely horrible.

340
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,191
Pop tall to the lone pine and back! Go!

341
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,627
Move your ass!
Let's move it! Get it going!

342
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:39,821
Let's go.

343
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,056
Let's go.

344
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,598
Bring them back.

345
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,638
- Circle back!
- Let's go! Get back here!

346
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,037
- Get back in line!
- Let's move!

347
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,870
- Back in formation.
- Let's move, move, move!

348
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,842
Back in formation.

349
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,437
Lean and rest. Senior Chief on deck.

350
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,044
Pop tall.

351
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,342
Oorah!

352
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,817
I don't care who you are,

353
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,022
where you are from
or where you are going.

354
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,024
I care about one thing
and one thing only.

355
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:44,084
That is the future victims
that you will be asked to save.

356
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,928
If I feel that you will fail them,
I will fail you, understood?

357
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,297
Yes, Senior Chief!

358
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,100
Hodge. Where are you from, Hodge?

359
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,368
I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey,
Senior Chief!

360
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,535
Hodge is our triple repeat.

361
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,846
Do you plan on making it this time,
threepeat?

362
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,176
I really hope to, Senior Chief.

363
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,080
Yeah, well, hope don't float, Hodge.

364
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,177
You better start to learn to swim
against the current and not with it.

365
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,154
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

366
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,185
Fisch.

367
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,891
Fisch. Why are you here, Fisch?

368
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,363
I'm here to exceed your expectations,
Senior Chief.

369
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,959
I'm a rescue swimmer at heart,
born, bred and water-fed. Oorah!

370
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,498
Wow. I bet you practiced that
all morning.

371
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,733
Mr. Fischer is
our high school swim champ.

372
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,607
He's had scholarships
to every lvy League.

373
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,606
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that he was so qualified.

374
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,284
I mean, you set records in a pool?

375
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,177
That's amazing.

376
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,984
I'll bet it was like, what,
eight feet deep in the deep end?

377
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,720
What if your nose plug didn't work?

378
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,888
What if another swimmer
had cut into your lane?

379
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,429
For the love of God,
you could have been killed.

380
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,707
Your schedule says that you will
perform a PT test this morning.

381
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,640
That will not be necessary.

382
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,372
Water is where
you've been called to serve.

383
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,311
Water is where you will be tested.

384
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,217
This will serve
in place of your PT in-test.

385
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,849
This is a golno-go exercise.

386
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,695
You will tread water for one hour.

387
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:29,330
You touch the wall, you fail.
You touch the bottom, you fail.

388
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,425
You fail and you go home.

389
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:35,500
Senior, this school operates
on a two-challenge rule.

390
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,598
You can't throw them out
on their first day.

391
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,700
If you cannot survive
in a warm pool of water,

392
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,145
then you have no business being here.
Does this class understand?

393
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,511
Yes, Senior Chief!

394
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,573
Oorah, Class 5506.

395
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,347
Now, who here can tell me
the rescue swimmer's motto?

396
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,251
"So others may live," Senior Chief!

397
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,813
Oh, I feel safer already.

398
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,986
You willing to sacrifice your life
so others may live, Goldfish?

399
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,926
Yes, I am, Senior Chief.

400
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:03,525
You will have to earn that right.
I want all of you to think about that.

401
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,097
There's going to come a time

402
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:11,572
when you reach the point of exhaustion
and you wanna give up.

403
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:15,035
Question is, will you?

404
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,949
There are three letters
that will set you free.

405
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:32,463
DOR. Drop on Request.

406
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,304
Look at that.

407
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,575
Waste of time.

408
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:05,021
- You all right?
- Hey. Come on, stay up.

409
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,705
Somebody help him out.

410
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,443
Hey, he's going under, man!

411
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,876
Help him out.

412
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,014
Come on!

413
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,244
- Help him out.
- Help him out!

414
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,227
Guys, relax, man!

415
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,232
Come on.

416
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,795
Come on, man.

417
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,834
You're dismissed.

418
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,134
- I cramped up.
- You're gone.

419
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,140
Let's go, Lyons,
out of the water. Hurry up.

420
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,240
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

421
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,509
On your feet.

422
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:08,289
muscle does not float.

423
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,762
Petty Officer Watson,
pull them out of the pool.

424
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,990
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

425
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,293
Let's go, people, out of the water.

426
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,762
Hurry up! Let's move, people!

427
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,065
Hurry up! Hurry up!

428
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,106
Class leader, right here.

429
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,573
I thought you said you were willing
to sacrifice your life for another.

430
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,143
I am, Senior Chief.

431
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,775
Then why didn't you
save your teammate

432
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,979
when he reached out for you?

433
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,848
I wasn't aware we were working
as a team, Senior Chief.

434
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,124
That's the only way we work,
swim champ.

435
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,601
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

436
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,046
Asshole.

437
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,243
- Come again?
- You heard me.

438
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,684
Hey, hey, hey! Ease up! Ease up!

439
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,145
- It's not worth it.
- Come on.

440
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,748
Good news, Lyons. I think there's
an opening on my buoy tender.

441
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,124
I'll put in a word for you, huh?

442
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,962
I'm really gonna miss that guy.

443
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,004
- Hey, man, what are you doing?
- Got your bunk back.

444
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,743
- Captain.
- Ben. Come in.

445
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,884
You work fast.

446
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,683
Lyons,
he was one of our top candidates.

447
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,990
Sometimes you gotta shoot a hostage.

448
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,460
Look, we all know
that you're a legend and all,

449
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,091
but our program
has been proven to work.

450
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,294
There's a gap between training and
what really happens out there, Cujo.

451
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,768
- Oh, really?
- That's right.

452
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,270
My intention is to narrow that gap.

453
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,331
Now, if someone has a problem
with that idea,

454
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,034
I'd like to hear about it.

455
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,814
Is this how it's gonna be, sir?

456
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,019
Yes, it is.

457
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,554
- Permission to be dismissed, sir?
- Granted.

458
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,092
Let's go. Let's go.
Keep it together. Look tight!

459
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,035
Keep it together. Let's go. Let's move.

460
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,734
You've got three minutes
to get this gear on. All of it.

461
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,406
Set! Go!

462
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,969
Let's go.

463
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,011
Are you ready?

464
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,123
Come on, rescue swimmer!

465
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,895
Don't quit on me.

466
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,278
Do you hear me?

467
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,748
Do you hear me?

468
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,578
Pop tall! Pop tall! Pop tall!

469
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:31,090
If you make a mistake, just fess up to it.
Take your licks and we'll press on.

470
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,854
Everybody now is gonna pay
for your potty mouth.

471
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:38,026
- Down. Up.
- One!

472
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,262
Down.

473
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,599
- Up.
- Three!

474
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,070
Down. Up.

475
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,835
Five! Six!

476
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,500
- Forward.
- Seven!

477
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,742
Are you crazy?

478
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,643
I'm the commander! Get up!

479
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,185
- Oorah!
- Get down! Get down!

480
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,111
Oorah!

481
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:05,684
Go.

482
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,033
Oorah.

483
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,769
Oorah.

484
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,171
Oorah!

485
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,903
Can you die from chlorine poisoning?

486
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,730
I can't feel my legs. I'm serious.

487
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,175
I don't know about you guys,
but I feel good.

488
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:56,304
This Randall guy, he's operating
on some whole other cylinder.

489
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,372
What is it, two weeks, and he's failed
almost half the class already?

490
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,849
He's a legend.

491
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,749
They say he's got
something like 200 saves.

492
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,583
I heard it was 300.

493
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,646
Who cares what his number is?

494
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,192
If he's such a stud,
what's he doing here?

495
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,887
How we feeling, boys?

496
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:12,894
Hey, Z, where you going?

497
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,831
My sister's best friend
is getting married,

498
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,765
and they're having
a big reception downtown.

499
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,700
I promised her I'd go.

500
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,601
Wait, you said wedding reception?

501
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,120
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

502
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,183
Hi.

503
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,293
- Congratulations.
- Hi.

504
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,353
Nice to meet you.

505
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:52,202
Yes, Kodiak, Alaska.
The number for Helen Randall.

506
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,441
Okay, try Helen Freeman.

507
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,711
You betcha.

508
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,321
<i>Hi, you've reached</i>
<i>Helen. Leave a message.</i>

509
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,885
<i>Helen, it's Ben.</i>
<i>Jesus, that was weird.</i>

510
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,917
<i>Haven't had to use your maiden name</i>
<i>since we were kids.</i>

511
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,921
Helen, if you're there, just pick up.
We need to talk.

512
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,626
<i>Please.</i>

513
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,848
All right. All right.

514
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,887
To those who have fallen,
to those who have survived Phase 1.

515
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,753
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

516
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,056
- Oorah, oorah, oorah.
- Guys, this is great.

517
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:55,758
And to our gal Lindsey.
You can rescue me anytime.

518
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,165
- Did he just say that?
- You did not just say that.

519
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,964
- Did he just say that?
- You did not just say that.

520
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:03,973
You know what, Doran?
You, I think I might actually let drown.

521
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,271
Oh!

522
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,249
Hey, Senior Chief.

523
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,782
Ben, she's hot tonight.

524
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,489
This place has not changed.

525
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,398
- <i>From Kodiak, Alaska...</i>
- Don't.

526
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:40,103
<i>... Senior Chief Ben Randall</i>
<i>is in the house,</i>

527
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,543
<i>big as day and still alive.</i>

528
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,843
<i>I must owe somebody money.</i>

529
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,884
- You're terrible.
- Oh, Ben.

530
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,649
I heard a rumor you were gonna be
teaching here in town.

531
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,989
If that ain't the karmic wheel spinning,
I don't know what is.

532
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:01,731
Well. To the prodigal's return.

533
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,400
- Where's your better half?
- She decided to stay home.

534
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,299
- Oh.
- Work stuff.

535
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:14,634
Yeah. Winter in Kodiak.
Let me see. Winter in Louisiana.

536
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,203
- All right, stop. Stop.
- "She decided to stay home."

537
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:21,476
Well, it's a good thing
we got a full bottle and half the night.

538
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,951
Yes, we do.

539
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,453
Check it out. She's staring at you.

540
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,854
That girl right there
is not staring at me.

541
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,725
Did you just point at her?

542
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,924
- Did she see you point?
- I don't know.

543
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,030
All right, now you gotta go talk to her.
You gotta go make a move.

544
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,071
- Yeah.
- I can't.

545
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,073
I just don't feel comfortable right now
talking to women.

546
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,075
You're telling me
you wanna jump out of helicopters

547
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,474
- for a living...
- You're talking to me.

548
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,876
...but you can't go talk to a girl?

549
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,608
- That's exactly what I was telling you.
- You're smooth.

550
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,547
All right, look,
I'm gonna help you out here.

551
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,551
I'll show you how it's done.

552
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,253
Pick out the hottest girl in here.
I'll take her home.

553
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,847
- Oh, gosh.
- Okay.

554
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:04,383
- Here he go, now.
- No, how about I will find the girl?

555
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,621
All right.

556
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,598
- Okey-doke.
- Who you thinking?

557
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,429
Make sure she's hot.

558
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,528
- Where you looking?
- Okay.

559
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,038
At the bar. Two o'clock.

560
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,201
- Yes.
- That's a good one.

561
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,138
There's no way in hell
she's talking to you.

562
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,944
- That one?
- Yeah, that one.

563
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,676
Hundred bucks says
she shuts you down

564
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,219
in less than a minute.

565
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,146
Boom.

566
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,192
- That looks like a bet to me, Jake.
- That's a bet.

567
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,595
All right. All right.

568
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,827
Hundred bucks says I close
in less than a minute.

569
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,459
Oh, absolutely.

570
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,732
- Hats off, man.
- Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

571
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,800
Clock starts when I talk to her.

572
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:54,902
That's fine.

573
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:55,968
This is
gonna be embarrassing.

574
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,070
All right, buddy.

575
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,409
What do you think?
What do you got?

576
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,541
- You think he's gonna do it?
- Yeah.

577
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,716
Evening, ma'am.
Can I buy you a drink?

578
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,724
I don't think so.

579
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,756
You don't know what you're missing.

580
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,968
You sure you wanna go with that one?

581
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,634
That's, like, your top-of-the-line,
A-game material?

582
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,673
See, the way I see it,
you got two choices here:

583
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,211
walk away from me,

584
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,753
or walk out of here with me
and split the cash.

585
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,545
Cash?

586
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,790
What cash?

587
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,193
The money you bet your friends
you could pick me up.

588
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,496
See, that makes me nervous.

589
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,126
She's shutting him down.

590
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,767
How much time you got left?

591
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,472
- About 20 seconds.
- Shall we?

592
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,848
- Oh, my gosh.
- No way.

593
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,384
It looks like they're leaving
the bar together, is what I see.

594
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,079
No way!

595
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,644
You have got to be kidding me.

596
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,212
- Unbelievable.
- How did he do that?

597
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,315
- I'm impressed.
- I'm impressed.

598
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,089
There's a bar outside your base
called Maggie's. You know it?

599
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,221
Yeah.

600
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:23,494
Good. Meet me there next Friday
around 8:00?

601
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,660
- You got a name?
- Yeah.

602
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,168
Don't forget my money.

603
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,142
You got a middle name?

604
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,544
You do realize I can't go back in there.

605
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,116
<i>This is the sound of death knocking.</i>

606
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,954
<i>SAR alarms and sleep deprivation</i>
<i>are part...</i>

607
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,963
Where the hell are they?

608
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:09,045
You know, the first stages
of hypothermia are the most critical.

609
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,102
Why?

610
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,074
Because you still have
the ability to think. Say it.

611
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,314
You still have
the ability to think.

612
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,186
The decisions you make
during this stage

613
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:24,091
are gonna determine
whether you live or die.

614
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,558
There a reason
you're not breathing, Goldfish?

615
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,127
Is there a reason
why you're not breathing?

616
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,092
I don't know anyone
who can stay alive without breathing

617
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,967
for 15 minutes, Senior Chief.

618
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,700
Are you a coroner?

619
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,040
Because pronouncing people dead
is not part of our job description.

620
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,601
What do we always say?

621
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,148
There's dead
and then there's dead.

622
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,877
We never stop, Jake,
not from the cabin to the tarmac.

623
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,978
- We never stop.
- Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

624
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,718
- Understood?
- Yes, Senior Chief.

625
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,590
Okay, Jake, in the pool.
Hodge, you're up.

626
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,126
You're with the dummy.

627
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,360
All right, now. Three letters.

628
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,200
Three letters will get you people
a cup of hot coffee and a blanket.

629
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,130
What do you say, Goldfish?

630
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,437
I'm actually not that cold anymore,
Senior Chief.

631
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:18,003
You're not cold anymore
because blood is moving

632
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,346
from your outer extremities
to your heart.

633
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,749
That's why your arms won't work.

634
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,950
You can plan on spending
roughly 60% of your career

635
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,958
in a mildly hypothermic state.

636
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,625
Senior Chief, may I have a word?

637
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:46,832
Sir?

638
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:51,337
Why wasn't I informed of this?
You know, we have classrooms.

639
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:55,215
Your assignment is to simply teach
the stages of hypothermia.

640
00:45:55,352 --> 00:46:00,847
Sir, in about two and a half minutes,
they'll understand.

641
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,722
Permission to carry on, sir?

642
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:09,788
Go ahead.

643
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,815
Three letters, people, will get you
a hot cup of coffee and a warm blanket.

644
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,684
What do you say, Class 5506?

645
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,914
Oorah.

646
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,796
<i>This is an oxygen-deprivation</i>
<i>anaerobic exercise.</i>

647
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,903
<i>You and your partner</i>
<i>will push your brick</i>

648
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,430
<i>along the bottom of the pool,</i>
<i>down and back.</i>

649
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:57,109
<i>If you need air, you may surface.</i>
<i>One breath.</i>

650
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:01,615
<i>Your partner must remain underwater</i>
<i>until you return.</i>

651
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:07,013
<i>Your brick can only move</i>
<i>while both of you are touching it.</i>

652
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:11,861
<i>If you both surface, you both fail.</i>

653
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,261
<i>This exercise is designed</i>
<i>to teach you teamwork.</i>

654
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:20,935
<i>On my whistle, drop your gear,</i>
<i>enter the pool and pair up.</i>

655
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,830
I said one breath, Sunkist. Let's go!

656
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:56,698
- I can't.
- Come on!

657
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:57,967
- I can't.
- "I can't."

658
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,703
Get your ass out of the pool! Let's go!

659
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,772
Come on! Lean and rest.

660
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,840
You wanna quit, just quit now.
I could use those new shoes.

661
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,182
Senior Chief, we got a problem.

662
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,056
Somebody's missing.

663
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:19,962
Jesus Christ.

664
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,501
That's gotta be a new record. Oorah.

665
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,778
I'm so sick of records. Go get him.

666
00:48:56,166 --> 00:49:00,296
You think I'm impressed because
you can hold your breath, Goldfish?

667
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:06,208
I wouldn't venture to say
what would impress you, Senior Chief.

668
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,976
All right. Get him out of the pool.
We're done for the day.

669
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,714
Out of the pool, Fischer. Let's move.

670
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,117
- Oorah!
- Move your ass.

671
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,622
Pop tall, Sunkist.

672
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,290
Out of the pool.
Out of the pool.

673
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,796
Records.

674
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,835
Never stare
directly into the flame, people.

675
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,847
It will impair your night vision.

676
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:48,749
This is a Mark 58 flare.
This is what it looks like.

677
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,651
It'll light up a 50-foot swath of water

678
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,589
and can be detected by infrared
miles out.

679
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,289
This is a demonstration model.

680
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,024
The normal one will burn
for 40 to 60 minutes.

681
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,759
Hey, pay attention.

682
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:07,668
The Mark 58 is used to reference
the wind, to detect a current.

683
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:10,332
Petty Officer Watson is gonna talk
a little bit more about that.

684
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,068
<i>Five minutes.</i>

685
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,575
The vessel you're looking
at right now,

686
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,244
people, is listing to the port side.

687
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,915
As a rescue swimmer, when you get
to the door of the helicopter,

688
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,753
you need to look down
and pay attention

689
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:31,191
to what you really have down there.

690
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:34,788
It's very important
that you understand your limitations.

691
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,494
Limitations without understanding
are gonna get you killed.

692
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:42,800
Case in point, this vessel's trapped
in pancake ice in the Bering Sea.

693
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,040
And as you can see,
the crew are out on the deck

694
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,838
in a relatively manageable
hoisting position.

695
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,503
But suddenly...

696
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,408
Those pieces of ice can weigh in
upwards of thousands of pounds.

697
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:59,217
Now imagine yourself trapped
in between 2,000-pound pieces of ice

698
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,916
trying to free-swim.

699
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,083
Thank you, Chief.

700
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,719
Next scenario, Petty Officer Watson.

701
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,786
Before you leave
that helicopter, going down to a...

702
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:12,767
Standardization is one of the reasons
we were so successful during Katrina.

703
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:15,737
We had crews come in
from all over the country,

704
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:19,242
but it didn't matter, because we have
all been trained the same way.

705
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,039
I didn't know my pilot,
I didn't know my copilot,

706
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,137
I didn't know my flight mechanic.
But guess what?

707
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,613
It didn't matter, because...

708
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:26,808
That's why we do it.

709
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,374
So you have to get your mind
wrapped around that idea.

710
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:33,253
When that helicopter starts going,
when the wind starts coming...

711
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:35,154
Twenty!
Down! Up!

712
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,988
- Twenty-one!
- Down! Up!

713
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,960
- Twenty-two!
- Down! Up!

714
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,020
<i>Twenty-three!</i>

715
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,588
- Two!
- Down!

716
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,224
- Up!
- Three!

717
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,495
<i>Don't need no land</i>
<i>Don't need no tree</i>

718
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,038
<i>Out in the water</i>
<i>That's where I wanna be</i>

719
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,187
- Hey, Mags, can I have a beer?
- Sure.

720
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,083
Well, well.

721
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,954
So you are gonna
have a drink with me.

722
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:16,795
No, I'm having a drink near you.
Entirely different thing.

723
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:21,869
You're a regular lightning rod,
aren't you?

724
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,135
- What's your name?
- Daisy Buchanan.

725
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,542
You're lying, Daisy Buchanan.

726
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,972
- There is that possibility.
- No.

727
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,040
That was a sure-fire lie.

728
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,951
So I take it
you've read <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

729
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:43,314
- Where's my money?
- It's not on me.

730
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,188
But it is close. In a very safe place.

731
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:52,160
Now, I've drawn a map
with a complex set of clues.

732
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:56,032
Each one is more fiendishly clever
than the last.

733
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,569
That works, too.

734
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,313
This is just a picture of your pants.

735
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:10,911
Yeah, but it's a bad picture, which is
what makes it so fiendishly clever.

736
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:12,243
Nice.

737
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,688
How did Emily Thomas
become a schoolteacher?

738
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,658
Well, how does Jake Fischer
become a guy

739
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,194
who wants to jump out of helicopters?

740
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,762
I killed a couple guys
and had to get out of Dodge.

741
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,562
- You're lying.
- There is that possibility.

742
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,133
The truth.

743
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,703
My bull-riding career
was going down the drain.

744
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:39,545
- Okay, that's better.
- All right, now you.

745
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,484
I really should go.

746
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,785
Go? What? No, you're not going.

747
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,291
We're just starting to have fun.
You're insulting my drawing.

748
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,260
No, you were insulting your drawing.

749
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,263
Although, to be fair,
it's a pretty lame drawing.

750
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,822
All right. Well, you can't go,
'cause you owe me a dance.

751
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,060
No, I don't think so.

752
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,931
Well, then, I'm gonna
have to take that money back,

753
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,698
'cause I wouldn't feel right
taking the money...

754
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:03,966
Look, every 18 weeks,
a new bunch of you guys comes in,

755
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,167
all looking to score with the local talent.

756
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,336
I live here. I work here.

757
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,279
It's a good thing
I'm just asking for a dance, then.

758
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,112
Okay, one dance.

759
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,016
No attachments. Just casual.

760
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,356
I'm a guy. I can do casual.

761
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:26,856
Mmm-hmm.

762
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,228
I am the king of casual.

763
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,262
There's just one thing, though.

764
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,966
You're gonna have to stop
undressing me with your eyes,

765
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,838
'cause there's no way
you're getting me into bed.

766
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:23,981
Hey, you.

767
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,621
I gotta get to work.

768
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,489
- I'm late. I fell asleep.
- What...

769
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,291
- They're gonna kill me.
- They won't kill you.

770
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,388
This isn't like school.

771
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,797
They don't hand out tardies
in the military.

772
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:42,434
- You smell really good.
- I smell like you.

773
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,939
- He never came back?
- Nope.

774
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:53,314
Wow.

775
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:57,046
Four years as lead instructor,
I never had one go missing.

776
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,050
All right, take the others to the pool.
I'll catch up.

777
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,785
Aye, aye, Senior.

778
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:22,409
Oh, God, there they are.
Stop. Stop the car. Stop.

779
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,468
- Here?
- Yes.

780
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,570
- Okay.
- I'll call you.

781
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:25,739
You better. Bye.

782
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,641
Jake! Jake! Jake!

783
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,779
<i>Airman Fischer's</i>
<i>coming in late, yeah</i>

784
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:33,845
Here.

785
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:36,824
<i>Airman Fischer's</i>
<i>coming in late, yeah</i>

786
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,882
Hi.

787
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,791
<i>Must be nice to go out on a date, yeah</i>

788
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:47,894
<i>Must be nice to go out on a date, yeah</i>

789
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,902
Oh, my goodness, look at this.

790
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,674
Look at this.
"Freshman Leads Team to State Title."

791
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,745
That's you.

792
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:00,573
Holy smokes.

793
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,882
"At only 16, Jake Fischer displays
the traits of a seasoned athlete.

794
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:10,182
"One thing's for sure: the future
looks bright for this young competitor."

795
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:15,362
Guess they didn't know
you were gonna flunk out of "A" School.

796
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,492
You have a nice evening?

797
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,239
Get dressed.

798
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,757
Think we need another brick.
Bring it in.

799
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:50,694
Goldfish.

800
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,433
Goldfish.

801
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,607
Thanks to Mr. Fischer's
extracurricular activities,

802
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:10,983
you have all now gone 36 hours
without sleep.

803
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,514
Blow it.

804
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:21,457
Class leader, you are done.
Form it up in the shallow end.

805
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:22,691
Aye, Senior Chief!

806
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:25,461
Class 5506, form it up!

807
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:30,430
No. No, no, no. You're with me.

808
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,340
<i>I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am</i>

809
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,745
<i>I'm here to pull your ass out of this jam</i>

810
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:42,080
<i>I jump from the helo</i>
<i>and swing from the cable</i>

811
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,142
All right, knock it off.

812
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:47,682
I am having a hard time
figuring you out, Fischer.

813
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,790
I mean, you like seeing your picture
in the paper.

814
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:55,062
In it for the glory, maybe a few chicks.
Am I right?

815
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:56,564
But when it comes down to it,

816
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,466
you will choose yourself over them
every time,

817
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,369
like you did on the first day in the pool,

818
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,637
like you did yesterday
by missing muster.

819
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,142
Won't happen again, Senior Chief!

820
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,742
Why don't you do us both a big favor
and quit?

821
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,544
<i>I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am</i>

822
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,810
<i>I'm here to pull your ass out of this jam</i>

823
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,880
<i>I jump from the helo</i>
<i>and swing from the cable</i>

824
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,586
<i>I'm not Tarzan</i>
<i>I'm just willing and able</i>

825
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,560
Give me something else, Senior Chief.

826
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,465
Thirty!

827
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,771
Thirty-one!

828
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:39,868
Thirty-two!

829
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:41,832
Thirty-three!

830
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,643
Thirty-four!

831
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,381
Thirty-five!

832
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,382
Thirty-six!

833
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,382
Stop. Drop them.

834
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,888
Senior Chief's on deck. Pop tall.

835
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,858
Oorah!

836
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,089
Morning, class.

837
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:02,529
Today we were going to learn

838
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,501
about how to approach
a drowning victim in high seas,

839
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,530
but I think there are some here
who aren't interested in that victim.

840
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,200
Fact, I think there's some in this class

841
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,245
who aren't interested
in saving lives at all.

842
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,612
I believe there are some

843
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:22,651
who are more interested
in setting records.

844
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,715
So today is record day.

845
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,235
5:28.

846
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,635
Put one on the board for Goldfish.

847
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,275
Wow, he's fast.

848
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,212
He's good.

849
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,682
You got it, man! You got it, Fisch!

850
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:04,224
Another record. Chalk it up, Chief.

851
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:06,853
- Get some.
- You are the man!

852
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:10,262
You people do not deserve
to be in the same pool as Jake.

853
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,233
He's destroying you.

854
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,672
Wow, look at him go! He's fast!

855
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,467
Wow, he's fast.

856
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:22,841
Come on, you're all fighting for second.
Just first loser.

857
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:23,936
This is fun.

858
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,072
We'll pass out trophies later.

859
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,579
Unbelievable.

860
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,783
Unbelievable.

861
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:44,760
You want me to pull these pansies out?

862
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:54,965
- You do not wanna hear about my day.
- Yeah, I do.

863
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,140
Man, this guy Randall...

864
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:04,346
You know, it doesn't matter what I do.
It's just not good enough.

865
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,854
Well, maybe he's just trying
to push you to be better.

866
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:09,323
You know, we teachers do that
to the ones we believe in.

867
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,656
No, it's personal with me.

868
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,559
He knows that I'm better than he was.

869
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:17,825
I mean, today,
I broke every one of his records.

870
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,800
I own them all.

871
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,693
Not all of them.

872
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:24,262
There's one record you won't break.

873
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,036
This is the <i>Aegis.</i>

874
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,572
Medical ship. Caught on fire.

875
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,938
It was a nightmare.
People burning in their beds.

876
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,678
And Ben Randall
got every one of those people off there,

877
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,186
except for this one guy.

878
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,620
And right when the ship
started to go down,

879
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,988
he reaches down and grabs this guy.

880
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,422
He's hanging from the cable
with this man's life in his hands,

881
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:47,963
and the winch jams.

882
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,557
It's 20 minutes to the base.
The man's screaming.

883
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,799
Ben looks him dead in the eye,
and you know what he said?

884
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:56,600
He said, "I won't let go."

885
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:57,934
What happened?

886
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:01,135
Dislocated his shoulder,
tore every tendon in his hand.

887
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,677
But he didn't let go.

888
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:05,612
Twenty minutes, just fingertips.

889
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,446
You break that record
and you give me a call.

890
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,599
My day was all right.

891
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,541
So here's my thinking.
We should go on a date.

892
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:45,173
- Well, what do you call this?
- No, no, no.

893
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,443
I'm talking about, like, a real date.

894
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:51,008
You know, with, like, a nice restaurant,
some nice clothes.

895
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:53,078
I'll get you some flowers.

896
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:55,715
I thought we agreed
to keep this casual.

897
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,986
Look, it's one steak. What is...

898
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:03,259
One steak is not gonna forge some
kind of a lasting emotional bond.

899
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,034
I'm serious.

900
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,494
Yeah?

901
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,538
- Yeah.
- So am I.

902
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,073
It's one dinner. What's it gonna hurt?

903
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:15,269
Well, if you ordered a steak,
I'd imagine a cow would be involved.

904
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:18,472
What do you have, an art gallery
over here? What is this "2"?

905
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:23,445
It's so the guy behind me knows
what place he's coming in.

906
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:26,013
What about this one?

907
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:33,017
That is the initials of the guys
on my high school relay team.

908
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:36,296
A drunken celebration gone wrong?

909
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,263
Something like that.

910
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:43,100
- So, about this date.
- God. It's just dinner, right?

911
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:48,166
No flowers, where we will discuss
nothing emotional or important?

912
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,603
I am fully prepared

913
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:56,677
to do an entire hour
on nothing but the Chicago Bears.

914
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:59,314
And we can have
completely meaningless sex

915
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,288
immediately afterwards.

916
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:04,758
You think I'm gonna sleep with you
on our first date?

917
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:06,694
Think again.

918
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:10,126
You just head-butted me.

919
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,765
I'm gonna teach you the breaststroke.

920
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:17,534
It's pretty complicated,
different than that of the butterfly.

921
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:24,878
I guess I can't sleep.

922
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,174
Well, of course you can't.

923
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,681
Your wife left you.
Your best friend died.

924
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,746
You sound like a damn country song.

925
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,520
If you had a dog,
he'd be run over by now.

926
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:40,426
- So, did she send you papers?
- Yeah.

927
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:42,253
And did you read them?

928
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,255
No, I did not.

929
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:48,493
Well, you think you might ought to?

930
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,375
You know,
there never was anyone else, Mags.

931
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,038
Like hell, Ben.

932
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,144
You're a bigamist.

933
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,318
You been married to the Coast Guard
all along.

934
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,288
Give me that shoulder.

935
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:12,352
You probably swum it out of socket
trying to prove you're still 19.

936
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,462
Am I right?

937
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,495
When the heck did we get old?

938
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,833
Hell, I've always been old, Ben.

939
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,736
You know what, though? I don't mind.

940
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,469
I mean, if my muscles ache,
it's 'cause I've used them.

941
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,704
If it's hard for me
to walk up them steps now,

942
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:34,546
it's 'cause I walked up them every night
to lay next to a man who loved me.

943
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,107
I got a few wrinkles here and there,

944
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:40,884
but I've laid under thousands of skies
on sunny days, yeah.

945
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:46,518
I look and feel this way,
well, 'cause I drank and I smoked,

946
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:50,361
I lived and I loved,
and danced, sang, sweat

947
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:53,925
and screwed my way
through a pretty damned good life,

948
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,662
if you ask me.

949
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,830
Getting old ain't bad, Ben.

950
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,000
Getting old, that's earned.

951
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,276
There will come a time
when you might have to decide

952
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:38,210
who lives and dies out there.

953
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:41,147
It's a terrible responsibility,
