1
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:53,698
VARNA

2
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,139
VARNA BULGARIA

3
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:11,024
Ladies!

4
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:26,104
<i>Baccarat.</i>

5
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:28,343
<i>Exquisite.</i>

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,740
Tihomir.
Hang up.

7
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:06,313
Bradley Fine.

8
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:15,515
- I'm honored.
- Pleasure is all mine.

9
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:18,206
Tell me where the bomb is?

10
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:19,855
10 seconds or
you’re dead.

11
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,935
Interesting.
You see.

12
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:24,676
When my men
and I hid it.

13
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:29,226
I made sure to
erase any witnesses.

14
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,939
And then I erased
the erasers.

15
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:36,723
Which means.

16
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:38,503
I'm the only one who knows...

17
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:41,002
just where that
dangerously compact

18
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:43,593
and transportable nuke is.

19
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:45,308
So.

20
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,755
I'll say I have
more than 10 seconds.

21
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,309
Well then.
In that case.

22
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,860
I say you better start...
Ah-choo.

23
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:01,108
Oh.

24
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:02,495
Fuck.

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,283
Oh my god.
What...

26
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,895
Why did you do that?

27
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:09,061
I didn't do it on purpose.
There's like a ton of pollen in here.

28
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:12,696
Oh God. Christmas on a cracker.
Did you take your medicine.

29
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:15,013
- I forgot it on the plane.
- I told you this morning

30
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:17,255
I put extra in
all your jackets.

31
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:18,256
You did.

32
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,841
Great.
Shit.

33
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:21,276
- Thanks.
- No. You know what.

34
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:23,804
That's on me because I heard
you sniffled a while ago

35
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,833
and I did nothing with
that information. So.

36
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,968
It's-That's blood on my hands.
Really, okay.

37
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:29,673
You know what?
You got 3 coming in.

38
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:33,044
Get out the back door now.
Move.

39
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:40,315
Anybody in here?

40
00:03:40,316 --> 00:03:44,866
Yeah, we got 1 coming
around the corner now.

41
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,767
Your 3 guests are coming out
of the door behind you right now.

42
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:49,138
Watch your 6.

43
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:55,037
- Yahtzee.
- Oh, zinger. Heh-heh

44
00:03:55,038 --> 00:03:57,396
Should have brought
more bullets.

45
00:03:57,397 --> 00:04:00,689
I thought they were chocolate sprinkles
which I would eat normally by the fistful.

46
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,858
But this tasted like, there's
no other way to say it really.

47
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:05,415
Like
a rat sauce.

48
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,789
Hey guys.
Can you please keep it down.

49
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,015
Look. Unfortunately there's
vermin in the ceiling again.

50
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:14,089
And I hate to say it but they-
well they pooped all over your cake.

51
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,710
- Am I going left?
- No.

52
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:18,054
Okay. I need you to go right.
and head down the tunnel.

53
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:19,613
You got 1 coming
around to your right,

54
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:21,092
and he's got a
swarm behind him.

55
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:25,013
- That's my girl.
- Oh, I don't know.

56
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,720
Watch your back.

57
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:44,502
Oh.
It's a close one, Fine.

58
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:47,005
- Whose the finest of them all?
- You are.

59
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:49,761
Oh, Bradley, you're so fine.
You're so fine, you blow my mind.

60
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:51,368
Hey, Bradley.

61
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:52,829
Oh god!
Duck!

62
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:57,838
Nice moves, Fine.

63
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,489
Bodies has been
working out for you.

64
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,697
- You noticed? - You just seemed looser
(Are you kidding.)

65
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:05,186
in your hips.
I mean athletically...

66
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:06,814
speaking.
I don't know.

67
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:09,070
I guess you don't seem
so awkward. (Oh, shut up.)

68
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:12,276
- Going straight?
- No. Go right up the stairs.

69
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:18,237
You're going to find a little friend
on the first landing.

70
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,288
- Thanks for your help.
- Okay, you are clear to the top.

71
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:26,429
Get moving.

72
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,825
Oh my god.
The rats can fly!

73
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:31,696
Come on, you guys.

74
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:33,847
Alright, Fine.
Stop at the door.

75
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:35,893
Okay, you have a guard approaching.
I'll tell you when.

76
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:37,420
Wait for it, Fine.

77
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,421
3.

78
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:40,324
2. 1.
NOW!

79
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:46,048
Oh dear.
Did I forget to knock?

80
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,771
They're culling at my hair.
I can't see!

81
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:55,312
What do you mean
you can't see?

82
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,863
I'm good.
You got SUV approaching.

83
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:01,385
- Go to the dock!
- Dock.

84
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:02,652
Excellent idea.

85
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,113
Fine, there are boats
at the end.

86
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,975
Uh-
No keys, Coop

87
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:27,906
Panel is on the lower left,
under the steering wheel.

88
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:31,007
You can.
You can hot wire it.

89
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,552
I can't get to the wires.

90
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:36,255
Then stay down and
hold your ears.

91
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:37,974
And how will I
hear your beautiful voice.

92
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:41,385
Stop being adorable
and get down.

93
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,849
Lock on coordinates:
43.16547, 27.94654

94
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,506
Fire.
Now!

95
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,119
Ha ha.
Bonsoir!

96
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:09,218
Nice drone work, Coop.

97
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:11,444
- I can kiss you.
- Oh well.

98
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:12,538
Well I would

99
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,567
I would accept that
with an open mouth.

100
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,032
Ha ha. Soon as I'm back,
dinner's on me.

101
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,214
Great work, Coop.
Oh, hey.

102
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:22,066
Pick up my dry cleaning for me
would you.

103
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,615
Also get my car.

104
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:25,021
Oh sure.
No problem.

105
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:26,806
Oh, and I have to
fire my gardener.

106
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:29,362
He keeps running over the
sprinkler heads with the mower.

107
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:31,561
Could you cut him
loose for me.

108
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:32,980
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

109
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:35,850
Sure, you kidding.
I love it.

110
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:37,398
You're the best.

111
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,379
- Smell you later, pal.
- God.

112
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,520
Poor Jaime.

113
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:44,351
The thing is.

114
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:46,082
Jaime, that uh...

115
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:48,188
Oh.

116
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:50,369
These your-These your children.

117
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,414
- Children here.
- Yeah, I have children.

118
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,070
Just have to cover

119
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,071
the eyes.

120
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:58,073
They're looking right at me.

121
00:07:58,074 --> 00:07:59,432
Please.
Don't fire me.

122
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,054
No.
I mean I would never...

123
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:04,015
This is... more of a
review.

124
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:05,027
Oh.

125
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:06,461
Oh.
Jaime.

126
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:12,078
Oh.

127
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:14,551
The... lawn... mower...

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh.

129
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,359
Right to the lawn mower.

130
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:31,859
You're a killer, Susan.

131
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:25,186
Oh.
These look delicious!

132
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,609
I don't want to be critical,
but this is very chewy.

133
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,070
Coop.
You're eating a hand towel.

134
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:47,602
Just,
cleansing my palate.

135
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:51,383
Jes. You had to take me
to such a dump?

136
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,042
Come on, cheapskate.

137
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:56,408
- Burger King was booked up.
- Ha!

138
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:58,680
- Sorry.
- Hey, I've been thinking.

139
00:10:58,681 --> 00:10:59,681
Yeah.

140
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,326
I couldn't do what I do
without you.

141
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:06,271
And I've been thinking about
doing something special for you.

142
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:07,272
So.

143
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,019
Good gravy, Fine.

144
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:16,900
Oh.
That's...

145
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:19,091
It's a crazy cupcake.

146
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:24,034
- You love cakes.
- Wow. That is wonderful.

147
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:26,081
Imagine, how
awkward it would've been.

148
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:29,203
If it had been a
diamond ring or something.

149
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:31,357
Not a diamond ring.
No.

150
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,018
Oh, I wouldn't had see it like that.
I wouldn't want to marry you.

151
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,665
I don't want your
musclely arms and hands,

152
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:41,178
rubbing my back with Nivea
for the rest of my life.

153
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:43,873
There are 3 kids running.
You know.

154
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:47,138
Karen, Tommy and Billy
and you said get out of here.

155
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,599
No, thank you.

156
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,817
I'll just... You know.
I'll just...

157
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:53,545
Giving me a little jewellery
I can actually wear.

158
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,736
Not going to wear it?

159
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:57,075
Yes.

160
00:11:57,825 --> 00:12:00,061
- I was just saving it. I mean.
- Put it on.

161
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:03,258
- Look at that, wow. That's a...
- That's an adjustable toggle.

162
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,115
Adjustable toggle.
You don't.

163
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:06,961
You don't see that.
It's a lot of jewellery there.

164
00:12:06,962 --> 00:12:10,735
- It's so you.
- Is it? Wow, perfect.

165
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:12,895
Seriously.
I- I couldn't do what I do

166
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:15,002
without you
in my earpiece.

167
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:16,815
I can never do what you do.

168
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,864
Can you imagine
me as a spy?

169
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:19,865
My god.

170
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:21,964
- Out in the field.
- Yeah.

171
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:23,396
- With a gun.
- What?

172
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:24,849
Elaine would
never let me be a spy.

173
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,194
I can't even
can't even dress like a spy.

174
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:29,767
I mean, you know. Look at you
and your tailor and your...

175
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:32,383
Everything is cut right,
and my, it's like a

176
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,608
lumpy, pumpkin
sag dress.

177
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,595
I...
It doesn't even have a label.

178
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:38,577
It doesn't even have a label.
I think my mom made it.

179
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,189
No. Stop.
Enough.

180
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,650
No.
Good god.

181
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:44,203
- Go easy on yourself.
- Okay.

182
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:46,061
We're a perfect team.
That's why we work.

183
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:47,062
Yeah.

184
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:49,088
Come here.

185
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,323
Come here.
Look close.

186
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,675
I think you're
getting a pinkeye.

187
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,290
- What? No. No. No.
- Right there.

188
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,171
Did you like wiped your eye
after you cleaned out the cat box.

189
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,722
I don't have cats.

190
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:05,883
- Why did I think that?
- I don't-I don't know.

191
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:10,204
You should get some.
There's good company.

192
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:13,613
LANGLEY

193
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:16,009
- LANGLEY, VIRGINIA-
We intercepted a chatter that the

194
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,336
weapon is still being offered
to the highest bidder.

195
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:20,857
Someone other than Boyanov
knows where that nuke is.

196
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:22,557
It's probably
his daughter, Rayna.

197
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:24,650
She's really the only
person he trusted.

198
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:26,400
Jesus, Cooper.
Do you have pink eye?

199
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,365
Go home.
You're going to infect everybody.

200
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,063
- Told ya.
- No.

201
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:31,703
It's not pink eye, ma'am.

202
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:34,899
It's just... I'm having a bit
of a allergic reaction.

203
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,436
Well, I'm allergic to disgusting
childhood illness. So stay away from me.

204
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:39,437
Sorry.

205
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,731
Anyway, you are right.
After Boyanov's death,

206
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:45,228
Rayna went to a safety deposit
box of a DSK bank in Varna.

207
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:47,541
- The chatter picked up later that
night. - What do we know about her?

208
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,681
I can pull up her file.

209
00:13:49,682 --> 00:13:51,290
Oh, that's stuck.

210
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:55,092
So warm in here.
I'll pull up my file.

211
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:58,691
Jesus, not on my keyboard,
with your pink eye infected fingers.

212
00:13:58,692 --> 00:14:01,471
Why don't you just cry directly
into my mouth while you're at it.

213
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,786
It really is just
a allergic reaction.

214
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:05,340
Sit down.
I'll do it.

215
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:06,508
Okay.
I'm going to sit down.

216
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:09,513
Rayna Boyanov.
Major at international law at Oxford,

217
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:10,649
top of her class.

218
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,715
Been living in London
for the past 10 years.

219
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:14,520
Now, we know she has
been communicating

220
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,790
with the heads of several
terrorist organizations.

221
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,197
Most ominously,
Solsa Dudaev,

222
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,061
The Al Qaeda funded leader
of the Chechen Martyrs Brigade

223
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,259
We have compelling evidence that
he has the machinery in place

224
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,509
to get that nuke to New York.

225
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,509
In time for next week's
UN general assembly

226
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,706
I'm already packed.

227
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:32,058
One of sources was told she's taken
residence outside of Sofia.

228
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:33,249
Go get her.

229
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,200
Grab my things, Coop.

230
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:40,167
Jesus, Cooper. Go put on
some sunglasses or something.

231
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:42,468
Feel like you're a gypsy,
cursing me with it.

232
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:43,987
Yup.
I'm on it.

233
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:46,858
God.
My life is a disaster.

234
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:50,261
- No, it's not.
- I'm 40, I live by myself.

235
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:52,498
I've not been in a
real relationship since

236
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:55,592
- Jerry left me 3 years ago.
- Jerry was a jackass.

237
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:57,770
I mean, when I gave up
teaching to join the CIA

238
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,001
I thought everything is
going to be different.

239
00:14:59,002 --> 00:15:00,524
I thought I was going
to be this amazing spy.

240
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,152
I'm just the same boring person
like I was before.

241
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,952
Well, for what it's worth.
I think you're brilliant as you are.

242
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:07,547
You're exciting.

243
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,934
You know what?
You played it too safe.

244
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:11,238
I don't know.
Maybe you're right.

245
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:13,139
I just.
I still- you know.

246
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,222
Hear my mom's voice.

247
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:17,553
Well behave woman,
often make history.

248
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:18,627
Yes, you do know the phrase.

249
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:21,322
"Well behaved women seldom...
make history."

250
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:23,304
Yeah that's, never heard she said it.

251
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:24,887
What about this.

252
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:27,423
Oh, just blend in.
Let somebody else win.

253
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:29,115
- Classic. Yup.
- I got that a lot in my schools.

254
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:31,740
And there was a
"Give up on your dreams, Susan."

255
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:34,665
She used to write that
in my lunch box.

256
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,285
Oh.
I mean, look.

257
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,286
Okay.

258
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:41,753
What's really so different
between us and Karen Walker.

259
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:43,876
I think-I think literally.
Everything.

260
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:44,954
No, hang on.
No.

261
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:46,737
Because you were just as
good as out in the Carvela.

262
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,790
She-She has more successful
missions than even Fine.

263
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,730
Oh.
She's the worse.

264
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:54,357
Look at her.
She's so perfect, isn't she?

265
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:58,155
Oh, hi. I'm Karen Walker,
Super spy. Heh-heh-heh.

266
00:15:58,156 --> 00:16:00,224
Perfect hair.
Perfect face.

267
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,935
She probably cries herself
to sleep every night.

268
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:04,030
- I don't think she probably does.
- She probably does.

269
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:06,570
And not like
sort of cute little tears.

270
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,469
Like brilly.
Sort of you know.

271
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,610
Silent kind of thing.

272
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,673
I don' think that.

273
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,742
Like sort of upside
down kidney bean.

274
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,598
- This is what I look when I'm asleep.
- Shh shh, shut up. Be quiet.

275
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:21,116
She wouldn't know who we are
She's not in front of us now.

276
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:23,613
Hi. Hey Nancy.
Hi Susan.

277
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:24,844
- Hi.
- Hi.

278
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:28,840
Hey, you 2 cuties sitting here
being all cute.

279
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:30,391
- Uh.
- Ha-ha.

280
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:34,113
Can I have an
Old Fashioned, please.

281
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:36,145
- His service is really slow.
- Super slow.

282
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:37,983
You're not getting that
in the next hour.

283
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:40,094
- Here you go, Miss Walker.
- Thank you.

284
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:41,370
- Oh.
- Wow.

285
00:16:41,371 --> 00:16:43,766
Alan and I go way back.
I come here all the time.

286
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,589
So do we.
Right Alan?

287
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,690
Hey, Alan.
How... Alan.

288
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:48,943
Big A.
Big A.

289
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:50,789
Yoo-hoo, Al!
You got a hole.

290
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,592
Miss Walker.
These 2 bothering you?

291
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:54,698
- Oh no. Thank you, they're fine.
- Okay.

292
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:56,683
- Alan.
- He's the sweetest.

293
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,797
- He just pretends not to know.
- He's funny.

294
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:01,697
Yeah, well.
Anyway, I'm taking some time off.

295
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:03,518
So I'll see you guys
when I get back.

296
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,067
- Oh.
- Where're you going?

297
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:07,698
- Capri.
- Capri. - Capri.

298
00:17:07,706 --> 00:17:09,850
I wished I could just
stick around here, you know.

299
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:11,492
Curl up with a good book.

300
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:14,847
- But, I have a yacht full of
friends waiting for me. - Wow.

301
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:17,218
Anywho.
I'll see you guys when I get back.

302
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,554
All freckle and tanned

303
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:19,989
- We're gonna see you.
- Yeah.

304
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

305
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:26,197
Oh, sorry.
Susan's ill.

306
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,371
It's her stomach

307
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:32,193
My god.
Thank you for that.

308
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:33,852
- Why would you do that?
- I'm sorry, I panicked.

309
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,903
What a great moment.

310
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:39,019
- Just looked a her.
- Oh, I know. That dress.

311
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,575
Look at her confidence.

312
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:44,626
They are even allowed
to smoke in here.

313
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:46,057
I'm gonna go home.

314
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:48,271
- No, come on.
- Yes.

315
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:49,272
Susan.

316
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:51,053
- Sorry.
- Feel better.

317
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:53,194
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.

318
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:56,606
- Fine. You good?
- Okay, Coop. Just pulling up.

319
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,922
Susan, you're killing it.

320
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:00,475
Oh good.
You know what, they are chicory.

321
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:01,886
- Oh.
- Yeah.

322
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,103
Any sign of her in the house?

323
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:07,974
Heat sensors aren't
picking anything up.

324
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:11,033
There's some kind of interference.
I don't like this, Fine.

325
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,746
I'm up for the challenge.

326
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:14,077
Let's go in.

327
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,470
Shoot. There is something
wrong with your camera.

328
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:21,962
Can you switch out
for a new one.

329
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:22,963
Too late.

330
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:24,457
Oh.

331
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:32,096
No security.

332
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:36,070
Her father would never have
let himself this exposed.

333
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:39,157
Okay. Pull back, Fine.
This is too easy.

334
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:41,938
I like things that are easy

335
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:49,636
Oh my god, Fine.

336
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,920
I don't know how you
do things like that.

337
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:54,452
Hey.
Who's the finest of them all?

338
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:55,873
I don't know.

339
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,227
I'm guessing,
you?

340
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,655
Drop your weapon.

341
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:02,161
Fine, what's happening?

342
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:06,258
Let me guess, whoever is in your ear
wants to know what's happening?

343
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:08,179
He's about to die.

344
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:09,526
That's what.

345
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:16,210
Awfully big gun
for such a little girl.

346
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:18,436
God.
Don't say stuff like that.

347
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,531
Okay. There's a knife rack
directly to your right.

348
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:22,920
The way she's holding the gun,
she's not experienced.

349
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,833
If you jump and launch.
You get the knife and disarm her.

350
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:29,706
Did someone just suggested
you grabbed one of those knives.

351
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:30,987
No-no-no...!

352
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:32,414
Damn it!

353
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,259
Fine?

354
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,757
Can they see me right now?

355
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:41,888
Let me adjust
the angle a little bit.

356
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:46,616
Oh my god.

357
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:50,822
His name was Bradley Fine.

358
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,554
He worked for the CIA.

359
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,466
Other top agents include,

360
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:59,890
Matthew Wright, Timothy Cress,
Rick Ford and Karen Walker

361
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,221
Come on, Fine.
Come on.

362
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:05,968
I know who all
your active agents are.

363
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:09,700
So. Unless you like the
body count to grow.

364
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:13,260
I suggest you stay
far away from me.

365
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:14,798
Now grab some tissues,

366
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,820
because it's about
to get real sad.

367
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:19,421
No, don't.
No!

368
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,601
Oh my god.
Fine.

369
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:26,713
As Deputy Director.

370
00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:30,685
I've never had
a more difficulty duty,

371
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:34,653
than to bid farewell
to colleagues taken from us.

372
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:35,794
From Dover,

373
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:38,320
to the family services.

374
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,367
To memorials like these.

375
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:41,757
It's tough to say goodbye.

376
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:43,875
There's nothing you could
have done, Susan.

377
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,196
Bradley Fine.

378
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:48,429
Was more than just
a co-worker and a friend.

379
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,130
He's a part of our family.

380
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:53,201
As family, even knowing that
the universe has a plan

381
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:55,252
for each human life.

382
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,743
It's hard to accept the
sudden lost of such a

383
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:00,064
good and decent person.

384
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:04,926
Okay. There's a knife rack
directly to your right.

385
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:07,868
Susan. I got your assessment
report on Rayna Boyanov.

386
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:10,528
I know you're probably feeling
a lot of emotion right now,

387
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:14,979
but please refrain from
using the term "thundercunt".

388
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,770
Oh my god. I-I didn't realise
I wrote that, I'm sorry.

389
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:28,951
Nancy,
I'm sending you a photo.

390
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:33,642
It's in pretty bad shape.
Can you enhance it.

391
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
Paris.

392
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,727
How the fuck did this thwart,
find out our fucking names?

393
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:48,139
We don’t know.

394
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,273
And I've looked way back
where the 'T' word for.

395
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:52,051
You're not immune
from the HR department.

396
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:54,830
Grow up. The thwart means something
completely different in England.

397
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:56,633
Well, here it means vagina.

398
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:58,797
Anyway.
Obviously we're talking about a mole.

399
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:00,711
It could be a mole that
could've hacked our system.

400
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:02,863
It's anyone's guess.
The bottom line is.

401
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:06,350
Rayna Boyanov is about to sell
a small scale tactical nuclear weapon

402
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:07,743
to a terrorist organization.

403
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,319
And we don't know where
she or the bomb is.

404
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,772
And fortunately, our analyst,
Susan Cooper found the lead.

405
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:16,552
Rayna had the number
of Sergio De Luca.

406
00:22:16,553 --> 00:22:18,467
We've long suspected
that De Luca of working

407
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:20,941
as an intermediate
with terrorist groups.

408
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:23,509
Rayna maybe using him
to find buyers for the nuke.

409
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,956
The number was to a office
he keeps in Paris.

410
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:28,441
I told you to send me
in there instead of Fine.

411
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:29,460
And you didn't.

412
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,582
And now Fine is dead.
I'm kind of fuck in.

413
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,673
You can't.

414
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:34,676
We need someone to follow De Luca
without being detected.

415
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:36,767
And I would hopefully
takes us to Rayna.

416
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:39,045
But it can't be
any of you.

417
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:40,966
Here's what we do.

418
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,915
I go into the
face-off machine.

419
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,572
Get a whole new face.

420
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,838
I turned up.
They'll never know it's me.

421
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,479
Do you have quarters?
'Cause it cost 50 cents.

422
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,796
What, I've got to pay?

423
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:52,139
No, because it doesn't exist.

424
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,232
Yes, it does!

425
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:57,140
I heard Chress and Wright
talked about it in the shitter.

426
00:22:57,141 --> 00:22:58,934
I'm pretty sure that
they're pulling your leg.

427
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:01,189
You pair of fucking vaginas.

428
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,484
Seriously.
You got to cut that out.

429
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:06,195
Jesus. Look, one of us
has to go in.

430
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:07,854
Doesn't matter if
we've been exposed.

431
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,989
We've all gone deep before,
and we always gotten our guy.

432
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,412
Guys.
This is more than just a kill mission.

433
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:16,318
Now we get Rayna, De Luca
and some top terrorist leadership

434
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,565
and get the weapon back,
if we do this right.

435
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:22,697
We just need someone who could shadow
them without attracting attention.

436
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:24,522
- We need someone invisible.
- I'll do it.

437
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:26,466
Okay, thanks lunch lady.

438
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,189
I'm serious.
I...

439
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,159
I've never been
out in the field.

440
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,604
Exactly.
Stupid fucking idea.

441
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:33,889
My point is that

442
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,799
it's highly doubtful
I've ever been exposed

443
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,731
But you worked with Fine.

444
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:40,075
They may have a
record of you too.

445
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:41,318
Possibly.
But.

446
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,264
You know. The odds of them
knowing my face are very low.

447
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:46,781
Ms. Crocker,
I would really like to do this.

448
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:47,782
For Fine.

449
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,361
You're not seriously
considering this, are you?

450
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,219
If you think,
I'm going to sit by

451
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,857
and let you send in a fucking
secretary to do my work.

452
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:58,786
You might as well accept
my resignation now.

453
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:00,170
If I can jump in.
I'm

454
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:03,957
I'm technically,
classified as an agent.

455
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:04,958
Look.

456
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:07,308
Full.
Full agent, so.

457
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:08,967
Agent, agent, agent.

458
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:10,068
I'm agent.

459
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,972
Are you considering this?

460
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:15,131
For your safety and the safety
of those around this table.

461
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:16,598
I'm considering it.

462
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:19,419
Then consider this.
I quit.

463
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:23,744
And I know there is a
fucking face-off machine.

464
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:27,935
You're just keeping it
a secret from me.

465
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,990
That hasn't happened before.

466
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:34,214
It is quite a lovely office.

467
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:36,080
What's your deal, Cooper?

468
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:38,596
- What do you mean?
- You got a faery side?

469
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:42,042
I really did in that report
mean to write cunning.

470
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:43,617
I've been going over your files.

471
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:45,777
You're top of the class
at the academy

472
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:48,469
in all computer and support skills.
No surprise there.

473
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,112
But you have a certain tame

474
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:54,152
demeanor around the office that
says you've never even held a gun.

475
00:24:54,153 --> 00:24:55,203
So imagine

476
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:01,510
my surprise when I saw footage
from this drill back at the farm.

477
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:04,815
Is that... kidding.

478
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:06,811
Is that me?
That can't really...

479
00:25:06,812 --> 00:25:08,542
Stupid gun.
Eah!

480
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,801
- Somebody definitely sped this up.
- Son of a bitch.

481
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,892
Camera angle,
does not make...

482
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,391
- Cooper. Cooper. Stop it,
- Okay, uh.

483
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:18,392
Ouch.

484
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:20,757
Those contacts, that's a,
you know.

485
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,612
I must have watched
this 15 times now.

486
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:24,521
Because,
what the fuck.

487
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,304
- Well, I...
- I almost put it up on YouTube.

488
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:29,270
Well, I was, to say the least,
uncomfortable.

489
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:30,486
with the event.

490
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,697
But I would also like to say
it was over 10 years ago.

491
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,075
The instructor was not harmed.

492
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,408
- Fine, was your mentor. Right?
- Yes.

493
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,891
Why did you not
become a field agent?

494
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:42,018
Well, we're such a great fit
and a great team.

495
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,083
I mean Fine,
made some great points

496
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,896
You know, maybe I match
better with... just staying.

497
00:25:46,897 --> 00:25:48,577
- In the Bureau.
- Well.

498
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:49,808
Yeah.
He sniped you.

499
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:52,085
All the top agents used to
do that before I got here.

500
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:54,933
I really thought he
made some great points.

501
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:55,934
Women.

502
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:58,207
Alright, have you any
field training since then.

503
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,616
- 10 years is a long time.
- No, ma'am.

504
00:26:00,617 --> 00:26:02,340
Normally I would send
you back to the farm,

505
00:26:02,341 --> 00:26:04,189
but there's no time and
I can't take a chance

506
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,268
of anyone leaking your name.

507
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:08,009
Am I-Am I going?

508
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:11,146
- You're going.
- Okay. (Jes...)

509
00:26:11,147 --> 00:26:16,607
- But it's a track and report
mission only. - Got it.

510
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:20,169
We'll be giving you a new identity.
You will not longer be Susan Cooper.

511
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,616
- Oh, I have a few ideas for that.
- Your new name.

512
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:26,311
I was just spit-balling and I thought
Serafina, Mannix, Gisele.

513
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:27,722
Carol Jenkins.

514
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:29,386
Carol
Jenkins.

515
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,774
You know.
If I may, ma'am.

516
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:33,551
There was a 13 year old
girl name Carol,

517
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:36,073
that used to come take me
around the neighbourhood

518
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:37,916
and used my braid as a dog leash.

519
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,156
And made me begged for biscuits.
So.

520
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:43,765
- Carol Jenkins.
- Yes, Carol Jenkins.

521
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:46,248
Carol Jenkins is a
single mother of 4.

522
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:50,404
Temporarily relocated from Delaware to
increase sales for a software company.

523
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:52,477
Okay.
That is-That is.

524
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,158
a different occup...
Huh!

525
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,581
- Is there a problem?
- No!

526
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,912
Just wondering if

527
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:01,976
this is my family of 4,
taken hostages.

528
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:03,185
I'm just not sure

529
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,715
how De Luca is going to take me
seriously if I looked like this.

530
00:27:05,716 --> 00:27:07,424
De Luca is not going
to take you anything.

531
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,721
In case you did not
hear me.

532
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:11,908
You're not to make direct
contact with any of the targets.

533
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:13,639
Track and report.

534
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,932
Now we're setting you
up in a surveillance office

535
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,246
across the street from De Luca's.

536
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:18,917
You'll be tapped into
the same telecom trunk

537
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:21,524
and have access to voice and
data coming into his office.

538
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:23,382
And that's as sexy
as it gets.

539
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:26,793
One mistake, and we got a
nuclear bomb in the hands of terrorists.

540
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,727
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

541
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:33,958
Go see Patrick.
He's got special equipment for you.

542
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:37,184
Oh my god.

543
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:39,994
What are you doing?

544
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:43,422
Oh, did you come up
with your spy name yet?

545
00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:45,790
My would be
Amber Valentine.

546
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,874
That sounds like you're
an adult film star.

547
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,470
No,
I did this 'Find name formula'.

548
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:52,295
Amber was the name of my first pet
and I grew up on Valentine Street.

549
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,073
Did you come up
with your porn name?

550
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:55,904
- Oh, no. Amber is a spy name.
- Yes

551
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:57,496
- No.
- What was yours be?

552
00:27:57,497 --> 00:28:01,013
Meatball Martin Luther
King Junior Boulevard.

553
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,514
- Yeah.
- Wow.

554
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:05,304
Oh my god.

555
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:08,237
I'm so excited.

556
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:12,173
- You're a spy.
- I know, I know. I guess you can say...

557
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:14,348
Oh, I got to get one of those. You
think you're going to get one of those!

558
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:16,271
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.

559
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:17,642
Look at that.

560
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:19,855
That looks high tech.

561
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:22,046
It's like the future.

562
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:23,903
- Patrick.
- Susan.

563
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:25,189
- Hey, Patrick.
- Yes.

564
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,588
I was given specific
instructions by Elaine

565
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:30,012
to tailor these
gadgets to you.

566
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:31,455
Wow.
Look at them.

567
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:34,276
- These are not yours.
- Oh.

568
00:28:36,872 --> 00:28:38,511
Is that a whistle

569
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:40,619
Elaine wanted you to
only be carrying items

570
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,997
of single woman traveling
through Europe would have.

571
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:45,790
But she can get that
from any pharmacy

572
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,393
Not this whistle.

573
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,642
When you blow
through this whistle.

574
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,457
A small poisonous dart flies out,
neutralizing your target.

575
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:55,449
Also, it needs your
finger prints on it to work.

576
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,287
Okay, that is-that is really neat.

577
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:59,467
That is really super cool.

578
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:02,404
This anti-fungi spray
can freeze and disable

579
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:04,184
any security system.

580
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:05,555
Wow.
That is

581
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:08,070
quite an image to be
carrying all over Europe.

582
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:09,671
It's also a pepper spray.

583
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:12,023
Why not, just make it
look like pepper spray.

584
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:13,034
It's a...

585
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:15,126
It's a pretty good idea.
Alright. Well, next time.

586
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:16,479
Well, I can-I can wait

587
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,501
if you wanna print up
a new label.

588
00:29:18,502 --> 00:29:21,252
No, I'll have to
turn the printer on again.

589
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:22,966
I don't really want to.

590
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:24,772
Each of these are
filled with chloroform.

591
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:26,783
Oh, that is and un...

592
00:29:26,784 --> 00:29:28,613
settling amount of
hemorrhoid wipes.

593
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:30,412
Makes me kind of wonder

594
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:32,701
what exactly is
going on back there.

595
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:34,224
I wouldn't know.
I don't have that problem.

596
00:29:34,225 --> 00:29:35,578
I don't have that problem.

597
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,633
If you ever feel like
you've been poisoned.

598
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:40,007
- Chew one of these.
[Stool softener_LAXATIVE]

599
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:42,458
[Stool softener_LAXATIVE]

600
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:47,351
Have I-Have I done something
to you, to upset you or...

601
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,672
This is peculiar theme.

602
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:50,775
Finally.

603
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:54,640
Every agent gets a night vision scope
hidden in their watch.

604
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:57,227
Okay. I've read about this,
I've even looked it...

605
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,628
- Oh.
- Who's that?

606
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:01,226
That is Bette Midler
and Barbara Hershey.

607
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:03,711
- From Beaches.
- Mm-Hm.

608
00:30:03,712 --> 00:30:06,713
How much am I
suppose to like Beaches.

609
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:09,089
I would imagine a lot
if you have the watch.

610
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,072
- Hey Pat, I'm flying!
- Anthony.

611
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:12,640
Don't wear out
the battery on that.

612
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:14,123
Am I-Am I getting that?

613
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:15,692
No. You are not going
to get that, alright.

614
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:17,376
I've already packed your bags.

615
00:30:17,377 --> 00:30:19,178
Hurry up and get dressed.

616
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:21,767
Carol Jenkins has to get
to the airport immediately.

617
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:23,795
And may I say.
I think it's very brave of you

618
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:25,979
to sacrifice your life
for your country.

619
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,870
Oh, not sacri...
I'm-I'm coming back.

620
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:29,971
Let's see.

621
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:42,761
You look amazing.

622
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:46,926
I look like someone's
homophobic aunt.

623
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:47,927
PARIS

624
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:49,997
PARIS_FRANCE

625
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,990
Wow.
Hotel Modiere please.

626
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:58,522
This is so exciting.

627
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,523
Oh.

628
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:02,002
The Louvre.
Wow.

629
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:05,945
Oh, that's a beautiful hotel.
Not that one?

630
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:08,070
Oh. I hope it's that.
Is it that one?

631
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:11,031
No? Oh, no.
Maybe next time.

632
00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:15,852
We're getting into
a- a little dicier of an area.

633
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:18,371
Oh.
It's a little unsavory.

634
00:31:18,372 --> 00:31:21,943
I think we can probably
go back towards

635
00:31:21,944 --> 00:31:22,944
my hotel.

636
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,126
No no. No no.
I hope it's-it's...

637
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:30,863
It's-I don't believe this could
be the Hotel Modiere.

638
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:33,921
Don't you think.
HOTEL MODIERE

639
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:36,432
Oh, this is.
Yes it is.

640
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:01,904
Oh man.

641
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:17,719
Keep it together,
Susan okay.

642
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:20,330
Nancy?
Please tell me you can hear me.

643
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:22,083
- I'm here, I'm here. I got you.
- Okay.

644
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:24,045
Okay. You'll be pleased to hear
that the bats are officially gone.

645
00:32:24,046 --> 00:32:27,832
We have now vermin free.
Did you get your gun, Carol?

646
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:29,654
Yes.
And don't call me that.

647
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:32,349
Oh, my God. I cried.
Peed, I think.

648
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,976
Having a heart attack.
I can't do this, Nancy.

649
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:36,791
Fine was the real spy, not me.

650
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,916
Don't worry.
I'm here for you, okay.

651
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,528
Everything is going to be fine. I'm
gonna talk you through this, alright.

652
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:43,424
Put your camera in.
I want to see your room.

653
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:46,924
Ewf. No, you don't.
It's that bad.

654
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:49,726
Martha Stewart had a
breakdown kind of feel.

655
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:50,777
Ooh.
Wow.

656
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:54,505
Looks like they put you up
in a Shits Carlton.

657
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:55,998
Hey listen.
Try and get some sleep, okay.

658
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:57,882
And we'll get started
first thing in the morning.

659
00:32:57,883 --> 00:33:00,251
I don't know what I'm going to do
when I see that Rayna woman.

660
00:33:00,252 --> 00:33:02,169
I want her dead for
what she did to Fine.

661
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,906
Okay, deep breaths.
Listen to me.

662
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:09,088
You're not going to get anywhere near
her, so there's nothing to worry about.

663
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:10,089
Guys!

664
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:12,490
There's a mouse on my tits.

665
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,195
I think you're safe there.

666
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:17,186
- Alright, goodnight.
- Night.

667
00:33:27,578 --> 00:33:29,628
You got this, Susan.

668
00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:32,018
You're a warrior.

669
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,534
You're a weapon.

670
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,431
Okay.
Look, no sweat.

671
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,883
Looks like you're
sweating to me.

672
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:38,884
Jesus!

673
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:42,887
What are you doing in my room?

674
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:45,271
What? How did I get into
this shit box hotel room?

675
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:47,630
- Because I'm a real spy.
- I thought you quit?

676
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:49,854
We have to stop the sale
of a nuclear bomb.

677
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:52,996
And they send in someone who
looks likes Santa Claus' fucking wife.

678
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,466
Uh.
Did you forget I'm undercover.

679
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,058
Because you're not
suppose to be here?

680
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,975
Well. I make a habit of doing things
that people say I can't do.

681
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:02,957
Walk through fire.
Water ski blindfolded.

682
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,809
Take a piano at a late age.

683
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,179
And I'm gonna take down
De Luca and Rayna and Dudaev.

684
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,729
And I'm gonna
get that bomb back.

685
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,439
- Why do you even care what I do?
- You think you're ready for the field?

686
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,369
I once used the
defibrillators on myself.

687
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,604
I put shards of glass
in my fucking eye.

688
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:21,199
I jumped,
from a high rise building.

689
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,006
Using only a raincoat,
as a parachute.

690
00:34:24,007 --> 00:34:25,786
I broke both legs upon landing.

691
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:27,426
And I still had to pretend

692
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:29,865
I was in a fucking
Cirque Du Soleil show.

693
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:33,001
I've swallowed enough microchips
and shit them back out again.

694
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:34,444
To make a computer.

695
00:34:34,445 --> 00:34:37,194
This arm has been
ripped off completely.

696
00:34:37,195 --> 00:34:39,503
And re-attached with
this fucking hand.

697
00:34:39,504 --> 00:34:43,300
You know it's, that's impossible.
I mean medically.

698
00:34:43,301 --> 00:34:46,072
During the threat of
an assassination attempt

699
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:47,654
I appeared convincingly,

700
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:50,584
in front of Congress,
as Barack Obama.

701
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:53,989
In black face?
That's not appropriate.

702
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,068
I watched the woman I loved,
get tossed from a plane.

703
00:34:57,069 --> 00:34:59,693
And hit by another plane,
midair!

704
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:03,964
I drove a car off the freeway,
on top of a train,

705
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:06,628
while I was on fire.
Not the car!

706
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:08,139
I was on fire.

707
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,528
Jesus.
You're intense.

708
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:13,849
Took this from your mini-bar.

709
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,220
Well, that's not right.

710
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:23,545
You're going to ruin this mission.

711
00:35:23,546 --> 00:35:26,530
No.
You're going to ruin this mission.

712
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:27,901
No.
You are.

713
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:32,208
No, you're going to.

714
00:35:32,993 --> 00:35:35,763
- You times infinity.
- Oh.

715
00:35:36,683 --> 00:35:40,003
Could this hotel be more murdery.

716
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:50,152
Okay.
So my office is in here.

717
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:56,153
Which means that De Luke's is
right across the street at 39...

718
00:35:57,706 --> 00:36:00,811
Oh God. Tell me that's not
De Luca's building?

719
00:36:00,812 --> 00:36:02,868
De Luca must have known
we were coming.

720
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,669
What am I suppose to do now?

721
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,236
Okay, don't panic.
Lemonade out of lemons.

722
00:36:07,237 --> 00:36:10,107
Stay focus.
We can do this.

723
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:12,998
Excuse me, please.
- Yes?

724
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,250
When this building burned down?

725
00:36:16,895 --> 00:36:20,085
Last night.
It was a big fire.

726
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:22,435
See.
There.

727
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:25,181
- Can I?
- Here You Go.

728
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,684
Does this man
lives on this street?

729
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:37,089
No, no.
I don't know him.

730
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,488
Okay.
I got it. I got it.

731
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:44,489
I'll run it through the system.
It will take a few minutes.

732
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:48,973
Nothing's coming up.

733
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,484
Might just be a looky-loo.

734
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:53,288
Well. Keep looking.
I've got a feeling about this guy.

735
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:58,459
Well, I've got a feeling
you're about to fuck things up.

736
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,167
Oh. Bugger me with a fishfork.
It's Ford.

737
00:37:01,168 --> 00:37:03,463
Sharon? Ford is in the field.
Did you know this?

738
00:37:03,464 --> 00:37:05,647
Until he checks in,
there's nothing I can do.

739
00:37:05,648 --> 00:37:08,016
You go make some friends
and stop stalking me.

740
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,232
Was it your mission
to tip off the target,

741
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:12,811
so he burns everything
in their butts?

742
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:14,907
It's so well done.
Phenomenal.

743
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:18,106
I'm sure they got suspicious because
they've been seeing you all over the place.

744
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:20,356
- You're going to get yourself killed.
- Nothing kills me.

745
00:37:20,357 --> 00:37:23,524
I am immune to
179 different kinds of poison.

746
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:26,271
I know because I
ingested them all at once.

747
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:28,915
When I was deep undercover
in an underground,

748
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,614
- poison ingesting crime ring.
- Wow.

749
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:34,213
It was like dog fighting.
But instead of dogs fighting

750
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:39,960
It was humans ingesting poison and rich
people will bet whether we would live or die.

751
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:42,279
Yeah. I'm having a hard time
with this one.

752
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,021
I died for 5 minutes,
and then I came back to life.

753
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:48,116
Was it worth... He looks like
he's in the cast of Newsies.

754
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:49,908
Does Crocker even
know you're here?

755
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:52,453
I don't need anyone's permission
to save the country.

756
00:37:52,454 --> 00:37:54,914
and avenge my dear friend,
Bradley Fine's death.

757
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:57,662
You've didn't ever liked him.
You used to call him Beverly Whine.

758
00:37:57,663 --> 00:38:00,186
You had him as secret Santa
and you gave him tampons.

759
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:01,864
It's called the rivalry of men.

760
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,278
You wouldn't understand it.
Unless you got the dong

761
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:05,724
up underneath that skirt.

762
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:08,957
Okay. That's super rude and
don't say dong. Don't do that.

763
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:12,162
Nobody sees me when
I don't want them to.

764
00:38:12,163 --> 00:38:15,123
I move like a fucking shadow.

765
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:17,177
Oh.
Excuse me, sir.

766
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,803
He's gone all sorts of rogue.

767
00:38:18,804 --> 00:38:20,661
Sharon says he really did quit.
Elaine couldn’t stop him.

768
00:38:20,662 --> 00:38:21,889
He's out for blood.

769
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:27,390
Yeah, a real tough guy and
his Louis Vuitton backpack.

770
00:38:27,718 --> 00:38:29,242
Nancy, do you see that?

771
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:31,822
It's the man from the fire.

772
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:34,817
- I'm follow him.
- Oh, exciting.

773
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:36,359
And I'm follow you,
follow him.

774
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,690
So I'm having
quite a day here.

775
00:38:43,982 --> 00:38:46,353
Do you think Ford is
leading him to a trap?

776
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:50,994
Idiot doesn't even know
he is being followed.

777
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:55,004
Okay. He is meeting with some woman.
I don't recognize her.

778
00:38:55,005 --> 00:38:56,664
You have any idea who she is?

779
00:38:56,665 --> 00:39:01,905
No, it's hard to make out.
Can you get any closer?

780
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,046
Nancy, our guys just switched
Rick Ford's backpack.

781
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:06,467
It's a setup.

782
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,313
I got to go warn him.

783
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,775
Ford! Ford! Look out!
I got to get through!

784
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:15,278
I left my baby in the shop.

785
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:17,718
Get out of the way!
Let me through, I'm sick!

786
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,866
Susan, tell them
you shat your pants.

787
00:39:19,867 --> 00:39:21,713
That would get me
out of your way for sure.

788
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:23,404
I shat my pants!

789
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:26,012
Excuse me.
Ford!

790
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:29,998
He's got a friend.

791
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:34,121
Hello everyone!
Hands up!

792
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:36,329
Let's dance!

793
00:39:46,077 --> 00:39:47,077
Ford!

794
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:49,569
Ford!
Ford!

795
00:39:56,608 --> 00:39:58,132
I need your mic!

796
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:00,003
No... I need.
No!

797
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,639
I...
No!

798
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:04,598
No no no.
Don't.

799
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:07,915
Susan, you're meant to be blending in.
What are you doing?

800
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:08,966
No!
Move!

801
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:11,968
Rick Ford!

802
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:16,307
Give me the mike!

803
00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:19,854
What you're doing doesn't help!

804
00:40:19,855 --> 00:40:20,855
Oh god.

805
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,390
Rick Ford!

806
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:27,191
They switched the bag!

807
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:30,049
Oh, fuck!

808
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:32,987
Get out of the fucking way!
Move!

809
00:40:32,988 --> 00:40:34,661
Get out of his way!

810
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:35,662
Move!

811
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,770
Oh, no.

812
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,686
Nancy, I'm in pursuit on
one of the terrorists.

813
00:40:57,687 --> 00:40:59,456
He took my picture,
he's going to blow my cover.

814
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,840
You're in pursuit.
What will you do if you catch him?

815
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:03,216
What in god's name are you
going to do when you catch him.

816
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:05,372
Knock him over with a hammer.
I don't know.

817
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:07,566
I'm still tracking and
reporting his location.

818
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,455
This all seem very
Rick Fordy to me.

819
00:41:09,456 --> 00:41:15,456
I do not condone this sexy but
reckless action of yours, Susan.

820
00:41:23,421 --> 00:41:25,665
Oh God.
He went into a building.

821
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,875
Okay, girl.
Well done, that's it.

822
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:29,545
Time to call it a day now.

823
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:31,715
Location is officially noted.

824
00:41:31,716 --> 00:41:33,957
- I'm following him in.
- What?

825
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,468
I'm doing this for Fine.

826
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:46,703
He's at the top of the stairs.

827
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,289
Oh God.
Please be careful.

828
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,597
You are incredibly
out of your league.

829
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:52,812
Oh. This is just like when I
watched myself in a sex tape.

830
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:54,709
There is just a lot of philandering
and laughable moments.

831
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,764
Nancy, I need you to not talk,
until I ask you to.

832
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:02,505
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm really nervous.

833
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:05,245
Be careful Susan.

834
00:42:43,087 --> 00:42:45,791
Oh, hey.
Imagine, running into you up here.

835
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:47,619
I was just looking for my bird.
I..

836
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,980
just looking...
Hey, Mr. Beanbag!

837
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,169
You like birds?
Alright. Alright.

838
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,712
Let me give you a warning.
I don't want to see anymore of that

839
00:42:56,713 --> 00:42:59,097
funny bomb stuff.
You know?

840
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,788
Alright, that's enough.

841
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,215
Drop the knife or I'll shoot.

842
00:43:03,216 --> 00:43:04,926
I don't think you will.

843
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:10,444
You see. It works better when
you have the bullets inside the gun.

844
00:43:10,445 --> 00:43:11,445
Oops.

845
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:14,795
I guess that CIA training
isn't what it used to be.

846
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:17,616
Guess you're right, asshole!

847
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:23,762
No, no, no!

848
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:30,188
Oh God.

849
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:34,968
Oh Susan, what did you do?

850
00:43:39,018 --> 00:43:42,348
Oh God. Not on him.
Not on him!

851
00:43:50,314 --> 00:43:53,791
Well. Rayna's people obviously
knew Ford was in Paris.

852
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:56,830
And getting footage of a CIA operative
setting off a bomb in a public

853
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:59,348
could be a PR qoof
for any terrorist group.

854
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:01,351
Do we have anything
on that woman he met?

855
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:03,206
Facial recognition
isn't showing anything.

856
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,832
They were all over Ford.
Are you able to track him?

857
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:08,807
Oh, God damn Ford is
still off the grid in Paris.

858
00:44:08,808 --> 00:44:12,265
I know, because he keeps trying
to hack into our system for Intel.

859
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:14,682
He's like a dog that gets
loose from his yard. And just.

860
00:44:14,683 --> 00:44:16,900
keeps humping and shitting
his way through the neighborhood.

861
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:17,996
Okay, here's a video.

862
00:44:17,997 --> 00:44:19,745
Make sure you got
everything on camera.

863
00:44:19,746 --> 00:44:22,280
Phase out of the hotel
and go back after the attack.

864
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:23,884
I'll take Renaldo to Rome.

865
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:26,391
Renaldo. We have a record
of anyone with that name?

866
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:27,646
Not that I'm aware of.

867
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:30,967
Nicola.
Are you listening to me?

868
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,444
- I was just testing the camera.
- Stop it. Find Ford.

869
00:44:35,445 --> 00:44:39,676
Hey, Nancy. Can you pull up Fine's
POV cam from Boyanov's office. And.

870
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,301
Look on the desk
there's some photos there

871
00:44:41,302 --> 00:44:47,302
and see if you can find one
of him standing next to a car.

872
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:53,527
Renaldo is a Rolls Royce.

873
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:55,205
Hack into the Rolls tracking system.

874
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:58,082
That car's a Wraith so is has a
Satellite Aided Transmission.

875
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,732
And tap into Boyanov's feed

876
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:03,199
His GPS should tell you exactly
where De Luca is in Rome right now.

877
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,597
I'm gonna head to the airport.

878
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:07,088
Forget it Cooper.
You're coming back immediately.

879
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:08,733
Ma'am, I really think
I can do this.

880
00:45:08,734 --> 00:45:12,254
And I'm not one to toot my own horn, but
you know what, I'm gonna toot.

881
00:45:12,255 --> 00:45:14,470
And say that, I just
saved a lot of people.

882
00:45:14,471 --> 00:45:17,474
We're so close in getting
Rayna and that bomb.

883
00:45:17,475 --> 00:45:21,705
- Pull back that rug in the corner.
- Oh.

884
00:45:24,132 --> 00:45:27,326
- You'll be given a new identity.
- Oh, thank God!

885
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:28,327
Oh!
No!

886
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,844
Your name is Penny Morgan.
You're a divorced housewife from Iowa.

887
00:45:32,845 --> 00:45:35,674
You sold more Marry Kay products
than anyone else in your state.

888
00:45:35,675 --> 00:45:39,203
You traded in a free car you won
to fund a trip through Europe.

889
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:42,979
My hobbies are decopatch
and needlepoint. I collect

890
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,500
porcelain dolls. And I am the
Vice President of the Ames Garden Club.

891
00:45:45,501 --> 00:45:47,028
I couldn't even be president?

892
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:50,862
Maybe I should just be married to one
of the dolls. Just to make it extra sad.

893
00:45:50,863 --> 00:45:52,966
10 cats?
What do I have 10 cats?

894
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,927
Is that even legal?

895
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,703
You know Fine,
he got to be a businessman.

896
00:45:57,704 --> 00:45:59,788
Once he was even
a race car driver.

897
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:01,654
Well, there's the 10 cats.

898
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:04,950
Just missing the shirt that says
I've never felt the touch of a man.

899
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:06,469
Oh Cooper, you're right.

900
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:09,613
You did good work back there.
That would had been a real mess.

901
00:46:09,614 --> 00:46:11,304
Thank you ma'am.

902
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:13,583
You still
went with the cat lady.

903
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:16,454
It was already in the floor.

904
00:46:18,043 --> 00:46:19,043
ROME

905
00:46:20,073 --> 00:46:21,123
ROME_ITALY

906
00:46:38,231 --> 00:46:40,961
Hi beautiful!
How are you?

907
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,058
Oh my god.
So pretty.

908
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,380
Great.
That's a real confidence builder.

909
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:51,910
- Did you find De Luca?
- He's been at the Majestic hotel,

910
00:46:51,911 --> 00:46:54,873
but he's just left.
Heading south, okay.

911
00:46:54,874 --> 00:46:57,573
I'll guide you to him.
I've sent a ally to drive you.

912
00:46:57,574 --> 00:46:59,603
Elaine said nothing fancy,
so I

913
00:46:59,604 --> 00:47:01,884
I've gone with earthy.

914
00:47:05,632 --> 00:47:06,772
Woo.
Whoa.

915
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,611
- He stopped the car.
- Alo, Fuck off!

916
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:13,292
- Hi.
- Welcome.

917
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:18,965
- Hi beauty.
- Oh.

918
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:22,185
- Welcome to Rome!
- Thank you. Oh.

919
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:23,736
Thank you.
Oh.

920
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:25,609
I am Aldo.

921
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,573
Like, the shoe store
found in American malls.

922
00:47:29,574 --> 00:47:31,418
I'm Penny, like the penny.

923
00:47:31,419 --> 00:47:32,789
Like a penny.

924
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,984
- I like penne alla vodka.
- Okay.

925
00:47:35,985 --> 00:47:38,287
Did you just grab my butt?

926
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,428
Yes.
Come.

927
00:47:40,415 --> 00:47:43,565
We need to get you to De Luke.

928
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,620
Gravity Christmas!

929
00:47:52,457 --> 00:47:53,647
Oh, my God!

930
00:47:55,671 --> 00:47:58,181
Don't worry, I have you.

931
00:47:59,457 --> 00:48:00,507
Slow down!

932
00:48:01,531 --> 00:48:03,743
Nancy, are you sure this
guy is even an agent?

933
00:48:03,744 --> 00:48:05,318
Absolutely.
No, he's the best.

934
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:10,497
He's-He. Oh. Though there had been
some complaints filed against him.

935
00:48:10,498 --> 00:48:13,292
- Hey, watch the road! Watch the road!
- Hey, Mary! I love you!

936
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:14,849
Oh my god!
Watch the road!

937
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,884
Wow.
Aldo is making great time.

938
00:48:17,885 --> 00:48:18,885
Awww!

939
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:24,973
Watch the cart!

940
00:48:25,107 --> 00:48:26,107
Dead end!

941
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:29,122
This can't be right.

942
00:48:29,123 --> 00:48:30,223
Oh my god.

943
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:42,208
- God!
- Intriguing lady, we're here.

944
00:48:42,209 --> 00:48:45,536
Now.
You must go because I fear,

945
00:48:45,537 --> 00:48:49,640
if I stare into your beautiful
green eyes a moment longer,

946
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:51,097
I will fall in love.

947
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:52,558
Oh.
Too late.

948
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,222
Might as if it ever worked?

949
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:57,069
- I will take that as...
- That's a no.

950
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,911
- I Know.
- Take that as a no.

951
00:48:59,912 --> 00:49:00,912
God.

952
00:49:03,543 --> 00:49:04,733
Hey, ma'am.

953
00:49:06,186 --> 00:49:07,326
Ah, typing.

954
00:49:07,816 --> 00:49:09,866
I admire your thumb.

955
00:49:10,432 --> 00:49:12,054
You know.
You were just hitting on me.

956
00:49:12,055 --> 00:49:13,747
- I like to play the odds.
- yeah.

957
00:49:13,748 --> 00:49:17,689
Here is my phone number.
Memorize it, then burn it.

958
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,513
Do you have something for me?

959
00:49:19,514 --> 00:49:21,865
Do I have something for you?

960
00:49:21,866 --> 00:49:24,850
- Would you like something from me?
- I-Not that.

961
00:49:24,851 --> 00:49:26,690
What do you want from me?

962
00:49:26,691 --> 00:49:29,183
You're suppose to have an
envelope with my gun in it.

963
00:49:29,184 --> 00:49:30,848
I don't have a gun.

964
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:34,399
I am just arouse
from looking you.

965
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,432
It was a joke.
There is no gun.

966
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:42,078
They said you would no longer
be needing one.

967
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,129
Good luck.

968
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:45,783
Bye.

969
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,478
Gravy.
Was Pepe Le Pew not available?

970
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:51,777
Oh.
Stop complaining, Susan.

971
00:49:51,778 --> 00:49:54,361
You're getting more actions
than I had in days.

972
00:49:54,362 --> 00:49:57,083
Months. Years.
3 years and 40 days.

973
00:49:57,084 --> 00:49:58,928
Do you have an
update on De Luca?

974
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:02,931
Yes, yup. He should be
pulling up right about now.

975
00:50:09,367 --> 00:50:11,467
Oh, wow.
He is hot.

976
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:14,003
I'm not going to lie to you. I don't
think I can be objective anymore.

977
00:50:14,004 --> 00:50:16,579
I'm rooting for that guy.
I want him to win.

978
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,984
I'm joking Susan,
don't report me.

979
00:50:18,985 --> 00:50:20,787
Ewk.
And he is handsy.

980
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:24,040
Let's set up camp in the
pastry shop behind you.

981
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:26,570
According to our data De Luca
spends all night at the casino.

982
00:50:26,571 --> 00:50:29,908
- I'm going in, Nancy.
- Susan, you heard Elaine.

983
00:50:29,909 --> 00:50:32,792
Track and report.
No contact.

984
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:35,495
I'll track De Luca inside,
and then I'll report.

985
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:39,415
And if he initiate contacts with me,
I'll just- I'll go with it.

986
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:42,259
Susan, your cat lady look is
not going to fit in, in there.

987
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,244
That's right. Penny Morgan is
gonna burn her cat T-shirt

988
00:50:44,245 --> 00:50:46,140
and spend some of that
Mary Kay money.

989
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:48,691
This is full blown rogue.

990
00:50:59,237 --> 00:51:03,450
Hey, beautiful looking!
You are so pretty! Beautiful!

991
00:51:03,451 --> 00:51:05,849
You guys are terrible.
Awh.

992
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,934
I really hope De Luca is
still in there, for your sake.

993
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:09,693
And they're not going to
reimburse you for that.

994
00:51:09,694 --> 00:51:11,285
You should've gone to
cheaper stores, Susan.

995
00:51:11,286 --> 00:51:14,599
- Okay. I'm going offline, Nancy.
- Wait-wait. Wait-wait. Su...

996
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Susan!

997
00:51:21,588 --> 00:51:23,390
Well.
Bonjour now, boys.

998
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:26,567
If I'm not out in 10 minutes
it's because I won the place.

999
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:28,339
Let me just
rub that for luck.

1000
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,601
Oh, that's an oily-
that's an oily scalp.

1001
00:51:31,602 --> 00:51:34,512
Enchanté.

1002
00:51:40,652 --> 00:51:43,726
I'm sorry.
But I have to check you in.

1003
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:46,351
- Your name, please.
- Penny Morgan.

1004
00:51:46,352 --> 00:51:49,010
I- I don't see you on the list.
I'm so sorry.

1005
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:50,521
She's with me.

1006
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:51,599
Darling.

1007
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,403
You’re late.
The way you look,

1008
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:56,350
I say it's more than
worth the wait.

1009
00:51:56,351 --> 00:51:58,565
- Come. Let's get a drink.
- Ow.

1010
00:51:58,566 --> 00:51:59,926
Such a gentleman.

1011
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:02,868
You look absolutely stunning tonight.
And darling...

1012
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,541
What the fuck
are you doing in here?

1013
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:07,152
Well, that's quit a tone changes
and what are you doing in here?

1014
00:52:07,153 --> 00:52:09,093
You're completely
compromising me right now.

1015
00:52:09,094 --> 00:52:11,194
Oh, I'm compromising you?
Fucking hilarious.

1016
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:13,354
You're about to cause a scene
trying to get into this fucking place.

1017
00:52:13,355 --> 00:52:14,906
Give me a little credit.
What do you think I'm going to do?

1018
00:52:14,907 --> 00:52:16,646
Run over and be like:
"Hey, I'm a crazy lady!

1019
00:52:16,647 --> 00:52:17,392
Where's the buffet?

1020
00:52:17,393 --> 00:52:19,786
I'm from the Midwest.
Where's Blue man group?"

1021
00:52:19,787 --> 00:52:22,063
Okay. I'm not an idiot, Ford!
You're an idiot!

1022
00:52:22,064 --> 00:52:24,109
You should not be in this casino,
because De Luca here.

1023
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,193
- And I need to get close to him.
- Yeah. How are you going to do that?

1024
00:52:26,194 --> 00:52:27,547
How are you going
to do that, Cooper?

1025
00:52:27,548 --> 00:52:30,037
What. You're going to seduce him?
That your big fucking plan?

1026
00:52:30,038 --> 00:52:32,209
Yeah. What if it is?
Why is it so hard to believe?

1027
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,445
Because you look like a flute
player in a wedding band.

1028
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:37,226
That's fucking why!
I'm here to take De Luca out.

1029
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:39,589
Oh, sounds romantic.
I hope you get lucky.

1030
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,848
God damn it.
If I was trying to sound romantic,

1031
00:52:41,849 --> 00:52:43,836
you would be on another floor,
soaking wet and breathless.

1032
00:52:43,837 --> 00:52:45,769
Wondering what came over you.
But I'm not!

1033
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,061
So get the fuck out of my way.

1034
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:49,282
I need you to rein it in, buddy.
Okay.

1035
00:52:49,283 --> 00:52:51,420
If you take out De Luca,
we don't have a shot at getting Rayna.

1036
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:53,562
So take it down like 5000 notches.

1037
00:52:53,563 --> 00:52:56,183
- Take it down. That's how you get
polonium 2000. In your drink - Oh God.

1038
00:52:56,184 --> 00:52:58,881
I got 18 months in intensive care
for radiation poisoning.

1039
00:52:58,882 --> 00:53:02,659
I got 6 months without eyes, While
everyone I ever loved is gunned down.

1040
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,302
Really. Everyone that you loved has been
gunned down, and just you survived.

1041
00:53:06,303 --> 00:53:08,695
Did you ever think that maybe
everybody you loved is not being killed,

1042
00:53:08,696 --> 00:53:12,096
but they're killing themselves because
they can't stand to be around you.

1043
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:14,015
This shit is the real deal.
Life and death.

1044
00:53:14,016 --> 00:53:16,199
This, the field, is hell
a lot different than

1045
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,608
sitting behind your fucking
monitor googling shit.

1046
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:21,413
Stay away from me, Ford.
And do not let De Luca see you.

1047
00:53:21,414 --> 00:53:24,192
And by the way, I can see your gun
sticking out of your back pocket.

1048
00:53:24,193 --> 00:53:25,800
Unless you're so extreme,

1049
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:30,491
you got a second dick
coming out of your hip!

1050
00:53:59,381 --> 00:54:02,421
Oh, Konichiwa.

1051
00:54:02,655 --> 00:54:03,843
- Ma'am,
- Yes yes.

1052
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:07,059
- Seats are reserved.
- Of course they are, yes.

1053
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,856
I'm going to have to
ask you to wait outside.

1054
00:54:08,857 --> 00:54:10,263
Yes, absolutely.

1055
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:12,084
No?
Another door?

1056
00:54:12,505 --> 00:54:14,816
I knew that.
Of course there's another door.

1057
00:54:14,817 --> 00:54:16,337
Probably happens all the time.

1058
00:54:16,338 --> 00:54:19,859
- It's never happened before.
- Okay.

1059
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,410
- Ma'am?
- Yes.

1060
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:26,661
Ma'am, right here is okay.
No more exploring, please.

1061
00:54:26,662 --> 00:54:28,072
Okay.
Lovely.

1062
00:54:40,761 --> 00:54:42,531
- Nancy?
- Susan?

1063
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:44,461
Oh my god.
Hi.

1064
00:54:44,566 --> 00:54:47,270
I found her. I found Rayna.
She's with De Luca.

1065
00:54:47,271 --> 00:54:52,491
You did it.
Excellent trucking and reporting, madam.

1066
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:09,009
Oh my god. Somebody just
put something in her drink.

1067
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:12,077
- What is it? Is it poison?
- I don't think it's a fiber supplement.

1068
00:55:12,078 --> 00:55:13,968
She killed Fine, Nancy.

1069
00:55:13,969 --> 00:55:15,673
I could really enjoyed just

1070
00:55:15,674 --> 00:55:17,610
watching her die right now.

1071
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:19,401
And she's the only one
who knows where the bomb is.

1072
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:21,344
So Dudaev will never
get his hands on it.

1073
00:55:21,345 --> 00:55:25,046
Oh god, Susan.
What're you going to do?

1074
00:55:25,047 --> 00:55:26,709
Excuse me, ma'am.

1075
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:28,651
Ma'am, hi.
Do you speak English?

1076
00:55:28,652 --> 00:55:32,408
Because I think somebody just
put a roofie in your cocktail.

1077
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:34,912
- Are you sure it wasn't you?
- What?

1078
00:55:34,913 --> 00:55:36,846
No.
God, I wouldn't-I wouldn't never.

1079
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:38,551
Could you point the man out?

1080
00:55:38,552 --> 00:55:41,328
Well, he just kind of
zipped out that door.

1081
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:44,429
He's wearing a purple bow tie.

1082
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:51,372
Thank you, Miss...?

1083
00:55:51,373 --> 00:55:53,103
Oh. Penny Morgan.

1084
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:55,980
Oh, it's no trouble.
Really, I mean.

1085
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:59,075
I think us ladies,
have to watch out for each other.

1086
00:55:59,076 --> 00:56:01,351
I mean these kind of thing
happens all the time.

1087
00:56:01,352 --> 00:56:04,269
And people often try to roofie... you?

1088
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:08,054
Once, I asked someone for a Tylenol,
and they gave me a Tylenol PM.

1089
00:56:08,055 --> 00:56:12,695
I'm not sure what
their intentions were. But.

1090
00:56:14,312 --> 00:56:17,575
It seems they may have found him.
Would you come with me to identify him?

1091
00:56:17,576 --> 00:56:19,911
Yes, of course.
I'm...

1092
00:56:19,912 --> 00:56:21,372
happy to help.

1093
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:27,019
Holy shit.

1094
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:36,567
My friend here says she saw
you put something in my drink.

1095
00:56:36,568 --> 00:56:38,394
I don't know any of you people.

1096
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,116
Okay, I'm just in Rome on business.

1097
00:56:40,117 --> 00:56:42,427
I was about to head back
to my hotel and go to sleep.

1098
00:56:42,428 --> 00:56:43,428
Perfect.

1099
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:45,897
Just in time for a night cap.

1100
00:56:45,898 --> 00:56:51,898
- Apparently there's nothing wrong
with it. - I don't want your drink.

1101
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:02,081
Fuck you, Rayna.

1102
00:57:03,769 --> 00:57:05,539
Mmm.
Scrumptious.

1103
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:09,169
So.
Jokes on you.

1104
00:57:13,427 --> 00:57:14,427
Fuck you.

1105
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,083
Fuck you.

1106
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:43,535
How long was I out?

1107
00:57:43,536 --> 00:57:45,409
You fainted just long enough
for us to laugh at you.

1108
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:48,589
- What happened?
- It was all a dream.

1109
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,857
I'm just kidding.
A man's throat dissolved.

1110
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:53,728
Sorry, that wasn't my fault.

1111
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:57,883
Oh, thank you.
That's...

1112
00:57:58,533 --> 00:58:00,374
surprisingly polite.

1113
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:01,856
Sorry about that.
I just...

1114
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:04,211
I mean I've seen a lot of things
in my days. I just never

1115
00:58:04,212 --> 00:58:06,810
I have never
seen that, exactly.

1116
00:58:06,811 --> 00:58:07,811
Penny.

1117
00:58:08,096 --> 00:58:14,070
Do you feel the need to tell
anybody about what you just saw?

1118
00:58:14,071 --> 00:58:16,344
Am I going to tell anybody?
You know that

1119
00:58:16,345 --> 00:58:18,224
asshole got what he deserved.
I mean.

1120
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:20,756
I knew the second I saw him,
I thought.

1121
00:58:20,757 --> 00:58:22,607
That guy doesn't deserve a throat.

1122
00:58:22,608 --> 00:58:24,388
So.
Good on you.

1123
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:29,132
I would like to take you to dinner,
to say thank you.

1124
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:31,169
And we must discuss
this hideous dress.

1125
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,734
It's just hysterical.

1126
00:58:32,735 --> 00:58:34,297
Oh, ha ha.
Good.

1127
00:58:34,298 --> 00:58:37,045
That's-
That's what I was hoping... for.

1128
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,146
Oh.
And by the way!

1129
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,343
Christo is suppose to be
looking after me at the bar

1130
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:46,524
making sure nobody would
put anything in my drinks.

1131
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:50,826
Thought I give him a talking to.

1132
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:53,645
Seems fair maybe
dock him a day's wage.

1133
00:58:53,646 --> 00:58:57,591
Or shoot him in the head.
That always works.

1134
00:58:57,592 --> 00:58:59,577
- You know, Rome is quite amazing.
- Rome is the worst.

1135
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,488
- Yes.
- So boring and tacky.

1136
00:59:01,489 --> 00:59:05,156
I'm so glad one of us finally said it.
Eh-heh-heh

1137
00:59:05,157 --> 00:59:08,221
- You have lipstick on your teeth.
- Really?

1138
00:59:08,222 --> 00:59:10,047
Looks like you had
a box of crayons.

1139
00:59:10,048 --> 00:59:11,048
Damn it.

1140
00:59:12,238 --> 00:59:13,518
Here we are.

1141
00:59:13,877 --> 00:59:16,013
These should have been brought out
when we first sat down.

1142
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,782
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1143
00:59:17,783 --> 00:59:20,876
So far I'm riddled with
disappointed at the service.

1144
00:59:20,877 --> 00:59:24,927
So sorry. You know, ma'am.
I apologize.

1145
00:59:26,995 --> 00:59:30,599
You know, I once saw someone
eat one of

1146
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,830
these before

1147
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,794
This is strange.

1148
00:59:36,825 --> 00:59:38,532
Do you always tear your
food up into little pieces?

1149
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,544
You look like a squirrel.

1150
00:59:40,545 --> 00:59:44,545
I was just checking
for the consistency

1151
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,635
- Mm.
- You eat like a baby.

1152
00:59:47,636 --> 00:59:48,686
Thank You.

1153
00:59:48,763 --> 00:59:52,357
So, would you like to have
a look at the wine list?

1154
00:59:52,358 --> 00:59:55,088
Yes.
Penny, you can order.

1155
00:59:55,138 --> 00:59:56,958
Okay. Oh.
Passum.

1156
00:59:59,182 --> 01:00:02,065
OK. I'm feeling-
I'm feeling a red

1157
01:00:02,066 --> 01:00:04,521
Kind of a red.
Like a lot of noise.

1158
01:00:04,522 --> 01:00:07,423
Like a little bit of
a- a barky finish.

1159
01:00:07,424 --> 01:00:11,635
I tend to like a white, with the grid
of a hamus

1160
01:00:11,636 --> 01:00:13,996
That’s, of course,
been thinned out.

1161
01:00:13,997 --> 01:00:18,637
<i>Okay, here. I will have the
Sapori e Delicia.</i>

1162
01:00:19,733 --> 01:00:23,326
Right. That is the
name of this restaurant.

1163
01:00:23,327 --> 01:00:25,489
Yes, I'm aware of that.
So.

1164
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:28,658
Why don't you surprise us
with something we don't know?

1165
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,345
Like a delicious bottle of wine.

1166
01:00:30,346 --> 01:00:33,250
Right, sorry.
I'll be back in 5 minutes, okay.

1167
01:00:33,251 --> 01:00:35,870
So hard to get good help
these days.

1168
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:37,361
Don't you find that?

1169
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:39,522
When I was a little girl
growing up in Bulgaria

1170
01:00:39,523 --> 01:00:41,168
which is the worse by the way.

1171
01:00:41,169 --> 01:00:44,273
Poor people everywhere and
cabbage is continuously cooking.

1172
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:47,188
There was this woman who
was kicked out of her house.

1173
01:00:47,189 --> 01:00:48,799
And she lost all her money.

1174
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,435
She couldn't even sell her body.

1175
01:00:50,436 --> 01:00:53,252
So she became a clown
on the streets.

1176
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:55,611
She would performed all
her tricks standing in mud.

1177
01:00:55,612 --> 01:00:57,802
And just cry and cry.

1178
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,571
You remind me of this woman.

1179
01:01:01,572 --> 01:01:02,913
Yo, thank you.

1180
01:01:02,914 --> 01:01:05,814
Come on!
We're going to Budapest.

1181
01:01:05,815 --> 01:01:08,333
- Bu-Budapest?
- I have some business to finish there.

1182
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:10,460
And you can take my private jet
when we're done.

1183
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:12,199
Anywhere you want to get home.

1184
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,588
My way of repaying you
for saving my life.

1185
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:15,589
Okay.

1186
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:22,173
Is there a problem?

1187
01:01:26,336 --> 01:01:29,076
No, not at all.
Let's go.

1188
01:01:30,092 --> 01:01:32,964
Hey, what? What?
I'm just talking with the girl.

1189
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:34,889
Okay okay.
Let's not make a scene.

1190
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:38,894
You know what I need. Just get my room key
out and I'll grab a bag and pack my things.

1191
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,983
It's Susan.
She's sending a code.

1192
01:01:40,984 --> 01:01:43,598
- No, they can collect you back later.
- Shut

1193
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,556
And if the rest of your
clothes are like that dress

1194
01:01:45,557 --> 01:01:46,200
down

1195
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:48,561
I can send someone
to burn them for you.

1196
01:01:48,562 --> 01:01:51,562
- the power.
- Quit a zinger.

1197
01:01:53,162 --> 01:01:55,261
Shut down the power
to the casino in Rome.

1198
01:01:55,262 --> 01:01:56,262
What?

1199
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:59,583
Well, shut the entire
bloody grid down then. Now!

1200
01:01:59,584 --> 01:02:01,634
That would be great.

1201
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:09,754
Everybody please remain calm.
Stay where you are.

1202
01:02:15,327 --> 01:02:17,967
Oh, no!
What's happening?

1203
01:02:25,932 --> 01:02:27,212
I have this.

1204
01:02:28,504 --> 01:02:31,324
What the fuck just happened?

1205
01:02:32,362 --> 01:02:34,915
- God damn it.
- Oh my god. Rayna.

1206
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,602
Thank god your hair
broke your fall.

1207
01:02:36,603 --> 01:02:38,431
I don't know what happened.
The lights were going out.

1208
01:02:38,432 --> 01:02:41,914
And I thought it was a robbery.
Two of your guys slammed into me.

1209
01:02:41,915 --> 01:02:45,127
And took you down.
I think one of them touched my bottom.

1210
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,716
Are they going to be okay?

1211
01:02:46,717 --> 01:02:51,957
I wouldn't be worried about them.
Their fate has just been sealed.

1212
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:55,317
Sorry, oh.
I'll let you go. Let you go.

1213
01:02:55,318 --> 01:02:56,688
Shame on you!

1214
01:03:04,536 --> 01:03:05,536
Wow!

1215
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,658
This is a really jetsy plane.

1216
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:10,312
Is this yours?

1217
01:03:10,403 --> 01:03:12,534
- It is my father's.
- Oh.

1218
01:03:12,535 --> 01:03:14,400
You've never been
on a private jet before?

1219
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:15,401
Oh no.

1220
01:03:15,714 --> 01:03:20,977
I did get upgraded to premium
economy once, which was pretty plush.

1221
01:03:20,978 --> 01:03:22,568
Premium economy.

1222
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:25,108
Sounds like a pen
for dirty animals.

1223
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:29,800
Yeah, probably.
But it was not quite like this.

1224
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:30,851
Thank you.

1225
01:03:31,803 --> 01:03:34,020
Why are you being
so nice to me?

1226
01:03:34,021 --> 01:03:37,467
Can't just be because I remind
you of some sad Bulgarian clown.

1227
01:03:37,468 --> 01:03:39,600
You remind me of my mother.

1228
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:40,601
Oh.

1229
01:03:41,362 --> 01:03:43,881
Really? You know that...
I mean, you and I are.

1230
01:03:43,882 --> 01:03:46,102
You know, pretty close in age.

1231
01:03:46,103 --> 01:03:48,981
You're funny.
It's the Bulgarian clown in you.

1232
01:03:48,982 --> 01:03:50,720
- Okay.
- She was marvelous.

1233
01:03:50,721 --> 01:03:54,977
But she was different.
Eccentric, like you are.

1234
01:03:54,978 --> 01:03:57,667
The moment I saw you standing
there in that abortion of a dress

1235
01:03:57,668 --> 01:04:00,158
- Oh, come on.
- It's as if to say

1236
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:04,442
This is what I got, world.
It's hideous, but it's mine.

1237
01:04:04,443 --> 01:04:07,173
- This was her.
- Oh, wow!

1238
01:04:07,571 --> 01:04:10,422
Hey, how did you get that picture of me?
I look amazing.

1239
01:04:10,423 --> 01:04:12,283
Hello doppelganger.

1240
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:14,759
She was the only person
I could ever trust.

1241
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,941
- Well. Here's to your mom.
- To my mother.

1242
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:21,205
- And to you.
- And here's to you.

1243
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:24,181
You may never be
as wise as an owl,

1244
01:04:24,182 --> 01:04:26,648
but you'll always be
a hoot to me.

1245
01:04:26,649 --> 01:04:29,357
What a stupid fucking
retarded toast.

1246
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:32,858
- You're delightful.
- As are you.

1247
01:04:34,574 --> 01:04:38,354
Now.
Where did you say we're headed?

1248
01:04:41,751 --> 01:04:42,751
Headed

1249
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:46,113
Where did you say we're...

1250
01:04:46,114 --> 01:04:47,114
Oh God.

1251
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:49,480
If you ever feel like
you've been poisoned

1252
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:53,351
Chew one of these.
Chew one of these.

1253
01:05:07,131 --> 01:05:08,541
What happened?

1254
01:05:08,595 --> 01:05:11,643
I've never seen somebody
dive for stool softener before.

1255
01:05:11,644 --> 01:05:13,821
That's one thing that happened.

1256
01:05:13,822 --> 01:05:17,158
What did you do?
Did you drug me?

1257
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:20,161
Of course I did.
I told you, I can't trust anybody.

1258
01:05:20,162 --> 01:05:22,370
I had to look through
your things. Anyway.

1259
01:05:22,371 --> 01:05:25,944
Tell me. Are you hemorrhoids
particularly large or just tenacious?

1260
01:05:25,945 --> 01:05:27,265
Stop texting!

1261
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,310
I'm not texting
if you must know.

1262
01:05:29,311 --> 01:05:32,008
I'm playing Candy Crash.
And I just made level 95.

1263
01:05:32,009 --> 01:05:34,199
God, that is so rude.

1264
01:05:36,973 --> 01:05:38,793
Jesus, Colin,
What the fuck are you doing?

1265
01:05:38,794 --> 01:05:41,542
I'm sorry, Rayna but there's
been a change of plans.

1266
01:05:41,543 --> 01:05:42,743
Who paid you off, Colin?

1267
01:05:42,744 --> 01:05:46,325
Colin hasn't worked here for
like 8 months. I'm Frederick.

1268
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:49,001
Is that why you are doing this? Because
I didn't remember your fucking name?

1269
01:05:49,002 --> 01:05:52,053
Let's just say there are people who
really want what you're selling.

1270
01:05:52,054 --> 01:05:53,616
You don't have to do this.

1271
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,835
I can give you a very
comfortable life. Col...

1272
01:05:56,836 --> 01:05:58,798
- Mmm.
- You forgot my name again, didn't you?

1273
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,173
- No. No, I didn't.
- Yeah.

1274
01:06:00,174 --> 01:06:01,544
It's...
Hmm.

1275
01:06:01,797 --> 01:06:03,563
Don't say fucking Colin.

1276
01:06:03,564 --> 01:06:07,334
Fuck. I don't give a shit what your
name is. You're the fucking help.

1277
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:08,812
Nice try, Colin.

1278
01:06:08,813 --> 01:06:10,461
But Stan and I already se...

1279
01:06:10,462 --> 01:06:13,142
It's Frederick!
Frederick!

1280
01:06:15,826 --> 01:06:18,012
Sorry lady. But they
only paid me for one...

1281
01:06:18,013 --> 01:06:19,013
Aw!

1282
01:06:25,203 --> 01:06:26,663
Wha!
Come on!

1283
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,085
Rayna, go to the cockpit
and level us out!

1284
01:06:31,086 --> 01:06:35,546
Like I know how to fly
a fucking aeroplane!

1285
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:37,289
This was weird.

1286
01:06:42,674 --> 01:06:44,625
Blow that thing
all you want, lady.

1287
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:47,291
Yeah.
Why don't you blow me, Colin.

1288
01:06:47,292 --> 01:06:49,432
Aww.
It's Frederick.

1289
01:07:13,709 --> 01:07:14,759
Ewk.
Eww.

1290
01:07:30,617 --> 01:07:32,577
Oh.
For fuck sake.

1291
01:07:32,884 --> 01:07:35,944
I got it.
I know what to do.

1292
01:07:38,242 --> 01:07:40,022
Oh, are you okay?

1293
01:07:40,121 --> 01:07:42,703
No! I got a dead
man's head up in my ass!

1294
01:07:42,704 --> 01:07:46,074
This one's for Fine.
Down draft!

1295
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:51,060
Not again! Do you have any idea
what you are fucking doing!

1296
01:07:51,061 --> 01:07:54,316
Oh.
The controls are so sensitive.

1297
01:07:54,317 --> 01:07:58,411
God. One of these dead fuckers
just shit his pants.

1298
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:00,462
Okay, wait a minute.

1299
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:03,540
I got it.
I think I got, okay.

1300
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:04,541
Okay.

1301
01:08:07,497 --> 01:08:11,228
Good thing I learned to use
that Flight Simulator app, huh.

1302
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:13,814
Congratulations
Penny Morgan.

1303
01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:16,365
You just blew your cover.

1304
01:08:16,601 --> 01:08:20,971
Now put the plane on
autopilot and get up.

1305
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:27,268
Any bullshit and I'll blow your
CIA brains all over that control panel.

1306
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,329
I know what you're thinking.

1307
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,110
And you're wrong.

1308
01:08:31,725 --> 01:08:33,325
My real name is

1309
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,786
Did you come up with your spy name yet?
- No.

1310
01:08:35,787 --> 01:08:38,744
- My would be.
- Amber Valentine.

1311
01:08:38,745 --> 01:08:41,236
What are you?
A porn star?

1312
01:08:41,237 --> 01:08:43,549
You're fucking hilarious, huh?

1313
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:46,799
I'm a private bodyguard, and your
father hired me to protect you.

1314
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,160
Bodyguard.
You? Please.

1315
01:08:49,446 --> 01:08:51,741
That's funny. 'Causes the way I see it.
Without me.

1316
01:08:51,742 --> 01:08:54,140
You would currently be
crashed in the Alps right now.

1317
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:56,627
Or you'll be laying in the morgue
with a hole burned in your throat.

1318
01:08:56,628 --> 01:08:58,981
You little spoiled piece of shit!

1319
01:08:58,982 --> 01:09:02,889
Why would my father
hired somebody like you?

1320
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,013
Because he trusted me.

1321
01:09:05,014 --> 01:09:08,113
And for whatever fucking reason,
he loved you.

1322
01:09:08,114 --> 01:09:10,531
Didn't even want you to know
I'm watching you.

1323
01:09:10,532 --> 01:09:14,732
So...He's the one who made me come up with
this whole loser Penny Morgan bullshit.

1324
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:18,839
Yeah, Oh, you looked like dead,
like my dead mama.

1325
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:23,226
And fuck you for saying I look
anything like that fucking beast!

1326
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:25,503
No wonder your father
never had the son he wanted.

1327
01:09:25,504 --> 01:09:29,696
You fuck that monster once and you just
dropped the fucking mic and walked out.

1328
01:09:29,697 --> 01:09:32,232
Fuck you!
Everything you said is a lie.

1329
01:09:32,233 --> 01:09:33,939
Oh, what happened?

1330
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,512
Did I hit a little sore spot?

1331
01:09:35,513 --> 01:09:38,872
Yeah. He always wanted a son,
and you knew it.

1332
01:09:38,873 --> 01:09:41,011
Look. He wanted you to
take over the business.

1333
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:43,443
He's just afraid
you'll get yourself killed.

1334
01:09:43,444 --> 01:09:46,103
So, if you want to live and
you want to load that bomb,

1335
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:47,732
you stick with me.

1336
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:49,993
And if you got
a problem with that...

1337
01:09:49,994 --> 01:09:52,864
Know what you can do, Rayna?

1338
01:09:53,872 --> 01:09:59,611
You and your bullshit accent can
land this fucking plane by yourselves.

1339
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,202
Okay, bodyguard.

1340
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:04,792
But if I find out you're lying
to me about of any of this,

1341
01:10:04,793 --> 01:10:09,669
I'll show you ways to die
you've never even dreamed of.

1342
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:12,885
Now let's go to Budapest.
I need a fucking drink.

1343
01:10:12,886 --> 01:10:15,666
Yeah, I bet you fucking do.

1344
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,566
Oh my God.

1345
01:10:26,593 --> 01:10:27,593
BUDAPEST

1346
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,269
BUDAPEST_HUNGARY

1347
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:41,377
FOUR SEASONS HOTEL

1348
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,808
Welcome back to the
Four Seasons Budapest, Miss Boyanov.

1349
01:10:43,809 --> 01:10:45,848
Don't talk to me, you're not my friend.
Get away from me.

1350
01:10:45,849 --> 01:10:48,719
Okay, move.
Move! I got it!

1351
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:51,576
So. What's the plan?
Who are we meeting?

1352
01:10:51,577 --> 01:10:53,724
You're my bodyguard,
not my business partner.

1353
01:10:53,725 --> 01:10:55,417
So just focus on
guarding my body.

1354
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:57,643
So not knowing who we're meeting
tonight is going to make me

1355
01:10:57,644 --> 01:10:59,559
...extra effective.
That's okay, I get it.

1356
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,142
I've got shit to do,
you'll probably be fine.

1357
01:11:01,143 --> 01:11:05,561
Why don't I go get you a nice dress
to be buried in. Dumb ass.

1358
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:08,808
I'm meeting a potential bidder
if you must know.

1359
01:11:08,809 --> 01:11:12,004
If they don't top the current,
offered sale will happen tomorrow.

1360
01:11:12,005 --> 01:11:14,965
- Where?
- I don't know yet.

1361
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:23,097
- Anton.
- Ouch!

1362
01:11:23,519 --> 01:11:26,064
Anton is part of my security team,
psycho.

1363
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:28,523
Yeah. Well, guess what.
I don't like his face.

1364
01:11:28,524 --> 01:11:30,225
I don't like the looks
on your face!

1365
01:11:30,226 --> 01:11:31,570
And who the fuck are you?

1366
01:11:31,571 --> 01:11:34,788
I'm the person that's gonna cut your
dick off and glue it to your forehead

1367
01:11:34,789 --> 01:11:37,773
so you look like a limp dick unicorn.
That's who the fuck I am!

1368
01:11:37,774 --> 01:11:40,671
Your name should be
Mr. Bagofdicks, not Anton.

1369
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:43,685
Okay, Jesus!
Let's just calm down, okay?

1370
01:11:43,686 --> 01:11:45,616
Does he not look
like a bag of dicks.

1371
01:11:45,617 --> 01:11:49,225
Enough! I can see why
my father like you now.

1372
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:51,678
Amber is my
hired bodyguard.

1373
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,271
Be more like her.

1374
01:11:53,272 --> 01:11:58,592
And your head had better
not broke my fucking phone.

1375
01:12:06,011 --> 01:12:07,639
Got a big night ahead of us.

1376
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,566
Don't be afraid to clean
yourself up, Amber.

1377
01:12:09,567 --> 01:12:11,052
Take a shower,
that's what I'm saying.

1378
01:12:11,053 --> 01:12:12,852
Yeah? Don't be afraid
to hit water yourself.

1379
01:12:12,853 --> 01:12:15,101
You smell like a dead hooker
that washed up on the beach

1380
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:17,749
and then roasted in the sun for a week
before they've even found her body.

1381
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,449
Okay, you need to take it,
way down.

1382
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:20,651
- I'm sorry, that's too much.
- I've told you.

1383
01:12:20,652 --> 01:12:23,187
- Okay. That was too much. Too much.
- Oh Jesus.

1384
01:12:23,188 --> 01:12:29,138
M.R. Sumon @subscene.com

1385
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:33,272
What are you staring at?

1386
01:12:33,418 --> 01:12:35,514
- Give me your fucking coat.
- This is a man's coat. So.

1387
01:12:35,515 --> 01:12:37,617
Yeah, but I don't see a man,
do I?

1388
01:12:37,618 --> 01:12:39,235
I see a reject from
"The sound of Music."

1389
01:12:39,236 --> 01:12:40,850
Well, I won't give it to you.

1390
01:12:40,851 --> 01:12:43,825
I've been in this dress for
12 fucking hours. Give me your coat.

1391
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:44,826
No.

1392
01:12:44,976 --> 01:12:47,547
- I'm gonna take that fucking coat.
- Aw.

1393
01:12:47,548 --> 01:12:50,269
I warned you. You Swedish
gummy fish motherfucker.

1394
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:51,270
Ouch!

1395
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:56,190
Oh my god.

1396
01:12:57,114 --> 01:12:58,214
Oh my god.

1397
01:12:59,552 --> 01:13:01,296
- Nancy.
- Oh my god. Susan.

1398
01:13:01,297 --> 01:13:05,291
Hello. Hello?
Just say something to me, please.

1399
01:13:05,292 --> 01:13:08,331
Susan, anything.
I cannot handle this, Susan.

1400
01:13:08,332 --> 01:13:10,894
There is nothing in real life
that someone could do to a spy

1401
01:13:10,895 --> 01:13:14,538
that is filthier or more upsetting than
what my brain would cook up right now.

1402
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:17,134
So save me from myself, Susan!

1403
01:13:17,135 --> 01:13:18,443
Because you know
what's gonna happen?

1404
01:13:18,444 --> 01:13:19,861
I'm gonna get chattier, aren't I.

1405
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:22,487
Did you know that you can't
have a change having big thoughts

1406
01:13:22,488 --> 01:13:24,972
- or the brain... - Oh my god, Nancy.
You're driving me nuts.

1407
01:13:24,973 --> 01:13:27,304
I couldn't talk because I was
in an elevator filled with people.

1408
01:13:27,305 --> 01:13:29,349
Oh, you're alright.
Oh thank god.

1409
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:32,164
You disappeared for 12 hours.
We didn't know what had happened.

1410
01:13:32,165 --> 01:13:34,605
Well, I had to take off my
earpiece and my camera.

1411
01:13:34,606 --> 01:13:38,049
Rayna is on to our agents. So she was
going to spot my equipment from a mile away.

1412
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,587
You're with Rayna?

1413
01:13:39,588 --> 01:13:42,285
You're not suppose to be
within a mile away of her.

1414
01:13:42,286 --> 01:13:45,356
Nancy, I know. But I'm in deep
and I'm getting such good Intel.

1415
01:13:45,357 --> 01:13:48,650
Please, I just need to remain on
radio silence just a little bit longer.

1416
01:13:48,651 --> 01:13:51,543
Okay, don't worry. Because I'll be out
to keep a better eye on you now.

1417
01:13:51,544 --> 01:13:53,980
Why are you saying that?
How?

1418
01:13:53,981 --> 01:13:56,154
- Eh.
- Wait. Wh-What are you doing here?

1419
01:13:56,155 --> 01:13:59,410
Elaine wanted to know exactly what
you're up to, so I tracked your earpiece.

1420
01:13:59,411 --> 01:14:01,925
- They sent me here to find you.
- They sent you?

1421
01:14:01,926 --> 01:14:04,705
Well. I was as unknown as you are,
so they thought my cover was safe.

1422
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:06,478
Did they give you an identity?

1423
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:09,525
It's so cool. I said I wanted
to be Amber Valentine. And.

1424
01:14:09,526 --> 01:14:10,946
- What?
- And they let me use it.

1425
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,520
Hey I don't know why you
get to pick your identity.

1426
01:14:12,521 --> 01:14:14,058
I had to go with
the freaking cat lady.

1427
01:14:14,059 --> 01:14:15,514
- Amber! -
Yes. - Yes.

1428
01:14:15,515 --> 01:14:16,991
- Who is this?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1429
01:14:16,992 --> 01:14:18,358
I didn't know the
police were here.

1430
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:19,803
This is my colleague.
Detective

1431
01:14:19,804 --> 01:14:21,749
The one I fucking
told you about.

1432
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,359
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did, Helen Keller!

1433
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,968
So, you're both named Amber?

1434
01:14:25,969 --> 01:14:28,781
Whoa! What did I tell
you about talking to me?

1435
01:14:28,782 --> 01:14:31,092
Nothing. You just said
nothing about talking.

1436
01:14:31,093 --> 01:14:34,312
You know what. You want me to have Cagney
and fucking Lacey explain it to you.?

1437
01:14:34,313 --> 01:14:36,065
Cagney's coming down
your fucking throat.

1438
01:14:36,066 --> 01:14:37,474
Lacey, she's gonna
come up your ass

1439
01:14:37,475 --> 01:14:39,169
I'm gonna meet them
in the fucking middle

1440
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:41,128
and play your heart
like a fucking accordion.

1441
01:14:41,129 --> 01:14:43,126
I'm gonna pump
that shit until it pops.

1442
01:14:43,127 --> 01:14:45,410
- You Swedish bitch!
- You wouldn't dare!

1443
01:14:45,411 --> 01:14:47,792
You gonna cry?
You little Swiss fucking pussy.

1444
01:14:47,793 --> 01:14:49,561
- I'm not going to cry.
- You're crying now!

1445
01:14:49,562 --> 01:14:52,712
I'm not.
It's so fucking hot.

1446
01:14:53,097 --> 01:14:57,239
Okay. You know. Just let's leave
Anton alone for now, please.

1447
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,769
What's your name?

1448
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:00,580
- Susan Cooper.
- What?

1449
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:03,342
- Oh, sorry. It came out.
- What did I just...

1450
01:15:03,343 --> 01:15:05,018
Not suppose to fucking
say her real name.

1451
01:15:05,019 --> 01:15:06,978
She's one of my best.
She's highly fucking skill.

1452
01:15:06,979 --> 01:15:08,483
- Very skill.
- At what?

1453
01:15:08,484 --> 01:15:11,456
Getting things out of
a higher cupboard?

1454
01:15:11,457 --> 01:15:14,706
That's-That's very good.
Because I'm tall?

1455
01:15:14,707 --> 01:15:16,992
Really, I'm not very good
at reaching high things.

1456
01:15:16,993 --> 01:15:19,698
A doctor once said to me that
I had the muscles capacity of an infant.

1457
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:24,109
- My arms are like 2 noodles...
- Get down!

1458
01:15:31,139 --> 01:15:33,610
Susan, get Rayna to safety.
Now!

1459
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:35,891
- I've got her.
- Go!

1460
01:15:39,711 --> 01:15:40,711
Go away!

1461
01:15:48,087 --> 01:15:53,597
Who puts a roof on a scooter!
What are you, the pope?

1462
01:16:04,076 --> 01:16:06,086
Get out of the way!

1463
01:16:12,849 --> 01:16:13,949
Oh my god!

1464
01:16:21,266 --> 01:16:26,337
They're driving crazy,
I can't keep up with them.

1465
01:16:26,338 --> 01:16:28,388
Okay, wait a minute.

1466
01:16:29,825 --> 01:16:30,835
I got it.

1467
01:16:31,811 --> 01:16:34,401
Alright.
A little detour.

1468
01:16:40,982 --> 01:16:43,402
Oh god.
Let's do this.

1469
01:16:49,946 --> 01:16:51,686
I am so bad ass!

1470
01:16:56,877 --> 01:16:59,634
Got it.
I know what you're saying.

1471
01:16:59,635 --> 01:17:03,595
Do your project now!
Just get to work!

1472
01:17:05,618 --> 01:17:09,083
Where are we going?
Smells like cheese over here!

1473
01:17:09,084 --> 01:17:10,911
Stick with me,
you'll be safe.

1474
01:17:10,912 --> 01:17:14,530
Crawl with me. I must protect you.
Crawl with me.

1475
01:17:14,531 --> 01:17:16,796
Fucking ridiculous clown show.

1476
01:17:16,797 --> 01:17:19,117
This fuckery stops now.

1477
01:17:39,661 --> 01:17:42,695
- Excuse me. Do you know if there is a
Popeyes Chicken around here? - What?

1478
01:17:42,696 --> 01:17:47,500
I saw a KFC down the way,
but I'm more of a Popeyes guy.

1479
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:53,501
The food is really weird I...
Oh my God, I'll ask someone else!

1480
01:18:06,262 --> 01:18:07,582
Okay, enough!

1481
01:18:19,103 --> 01:18:20,833
Drop your weapon!

1482
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,901
Oh my god. Karen.
Why aren't you at Capri?

1483
01:18:24,902 --> 01:18:27,332
I'm so sorry I shot you.

1484
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:30,447
You must have not known
it was me either. I changed my hair.

1485
01:18:30,448 --> 01:18:33,988
Oh, yeah. Looks really good.
Are those extensions?

1486
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:36,635
No.
It's just-It's just my hair.

1487
01:18:36,636 --> 01:18:39,726
- You know, a few clips, colored.
- Okay, if you say so.

1488
01:18:39,727 --> 01:18:43,967
I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry about this too.

1489
01:18:48,581 --> 01:18:49,771
Oh, my God.

1490
01:18:53,536 --> 01:18:54,726
No no no...

1491
01:18:55,684 --> 01:18:58,644
Susan, my thighs are on fire.

1492
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:00,829
I don't care.
Where is Rayna?

1493
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:03,263
I don't know. She slipped off me,
I was very sweaty.

1494
01:19:03,264 --> 01:19:04,754
- Karen Walker is dead.
- What?

1495
01:19:04,755 --> 01:19:05,910
She's a double agent.

1496
01:19:05,911 --> 01:19:07,891
Somebody shot her right in front of me.
I don't know who did it.

1497
01:19:07,892 --> 01:19:09,619
I don't know how deep
this whole thing goes.

1498
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,220
Oh my God.
Oh!

1499
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:12,447
Oh.

1500
01:19:12,858 --> 01:19:16,353
Get your motherfucking
asses up here!

1501
01:19:16,354 --> 01:19:17,354
Now!

1502
01:19:17,824 --> 01:19:18,824
Shit!

1503
01:19:19,064 --> 01:19:21,772
People are trying to kill me, and all
that's left of my fucking security team

1504
01:19:21,773 --> 01:19:27,773
is you two defending me! You look like
somebody's demented aunts on vacation!

1505
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:32,268
Do you have anyone on your team,
other than this asthmatic Big bird?

1506
01:19:32,269 --> 01:19:34,331
Yeah.
We usually just use her for

1507
01:19:34,332 --> 01:19:36,715
non-physical security resources.

1508
01:19:36,716 --> 01:19:38,792
I'm very non-physical resourceful.

1509
01:19:38,793 --> 01:19:42,421
I do a lot of reading.
I read palms and maps.

1510
01:19:42,422 --> 01:19:44,245
And I read all of
"The Hunger Games".

1511
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:45,927
How is that helpful!

1512
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:47,391
I don't know,
I'm panicking.

1513
01:19:47,392 --> 01:19:51,384
And you! You have to stop with
this stupid Penny Morgan outfit.

1514
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:54,303
You have to dress like
an actual human!

1515
01:19:54,304 --> 01:20:00,304
Get me more security when I come
back out here, or you're both dead!

1516
01:20:05,081 --> 01:20:06,743
Suck on this, Rayna.

1517
01:20:06,744 --> 01:20:08,826
This mission is going to cost you,
you know.

1518
01:20:08,827 --> 01:20:11,029
The clothing allowance cut off
half way through the last...

1519
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:14,118
Oh god. Could you please concentrate
on getting the new bodyguard.

1520
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:16,761
- God damn me! Please.
- Alright. Alright.

1521
01:20:16,762 --> 01:20:21,032
Crappy.
I've already contacted the agency.

1522
01:20:22,122 --> 01:20:23,492
Oh.
Come on!

1523
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:26,078
You, in this outfit.

1524
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:29,170
Magnifico.

1525
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:48,222
- You have anything yet?
- No one so far, Susan.

1526
01:20:48,223 --> 01:20:50,519
Slight intimidating crowd, however.

1527
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,750
Hello.
You look nice.

1528
01:20:54,233 --> 01:20:56,885
Ah, just keep laughing.
Looks fade.

1529
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:59,436
Just keep your eyes open.

1530
01:21:00,809 --> 01:21:03,549
God damn it.
I told you to dress up.

1531
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:06,212
And take off those gloves.
You look like Darth fucking Vader.

1532
01:21:06,213 --> 01:21:08,418
You know the reason I'm wearing these
gloves is because I don't know what kind

1533
01:21:08,419 --> 01:21:10,140
of woodland creatures is
going to come crawling

1534
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:11,766
out of that fucking nest
on top of your head.

1535
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:14,017
Whatever.
Keep a eye out for this woman.

1536
01:21:14,018 --> 01:21:17,446
She's the one coming
to make the bid.

1537
01:21:17,447 --> 01:21:19,367
He's got a friend.

1538
01:21:21,357 --> 01:21:24,135
I need you to keep your eyes open.
I may need your help out there.

1539
01:21:24,136 --> 01:21:28,054
To close my eyes in the presence of
this beautiful body would be a crime.

1540
01:21:28,055 --> 01:21:29,055
Oh god.

1541
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:33,677
Nancy. Okay, you know that women
I spotted in Paris, the bomber?

1542
01:21:33,678 --> 01:21:35,370
Well, she's coming tonight
to make the bid.

1543
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:39,302
If she really works for De Luca so we know
some things up. I need you to keep an...

1544
01:21:39,303 --> 01:21:42,083
God.
Son of a beast thing.

1545
01:21:47,243 --> 01:21:50,062
Excuse me, he's mine.
Yeah.

1546
01:21:50,063 --> 01:21:52,678
I didn't mean to hit her that hard.
God. You look like a balloon animal.

1547
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:54,409
Here, take those.

1548
01:21:54,941 --> 01:21:58,061
- Hi. What are you doing, Ford?
- I'm here to help you, Cooper.

1549
01:21:58,062 --> 01:22:00,496
You may have found Rayna,
but you cannot lose her.

1550
01:22:00,497 --> 01:22:02,377
- This isn't fucking play time, anymore.
- Yeah?

1551
01:22:02,378 --> 01:22:04,854
It's play time on your face
with your stupid mustache.

1552
01:22:04,855 --> 01:22:06,743
You look like a pervert
bus driver.

1553
01:22:06,744 --> 01:22:08,017
- Cooper?
- Yeah.

1554
01:22:08,018 --> 01:22:09,068
It helped.

1555
01:22:10,652 --> 01:22:11,652
Let go.

1556
01:22:12,211 --> 01:22:13,682
Yeah, who's dominating now?

1557
01:22:13,683 --> 01:22:16,048
You're putting this entire
operation in danger.

1558
01:22:16,049 --> 01:22:19,382
Your girlfriend, from the Paris bombing,
is on her way here to meet Rayna.

1559
01:22:19,383 --> 01:22:22,107
If she sees you, only my cover's blown.
And then we're both dead.

1560
01:22:22,108 --> 01:22:23,683
Just worry about yourself, Cooper.

1561
01:22:23,684 --> 01:22:27,425
Thank you for the beautiful ladies.
You guys okay?

1562
01:22:27,426 --> 01:22:28,796
Let's welcome

1563
01:22:28,935 --> 01:22:30,125
Mr. 50 Cent

1564
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,960
What's up Budapest.

1565
01:22:44,144 --> 01:22:46,424
Oh, shit.
She's here.

1566
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,177
Okay. We can't let Rayna see her.

1567
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:51,673
So, you need to take out her
bodyguards, and I'll deal with her.

1568
01:22:51,674 --> 01:22:55,105
- Hey. Nobody orders me around.
- God. Do you have a better idea?

1569
01:22:55,106 --> 01:22:57,186
We'll release
a gas in the club

1570
01:22:57,187 --> 01:22:59,556
causing everybody to get
temporary amnesia.

1571
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:01,065
- Get a 100 sticks of dynamite...
- Oh god.

1572
01:23:01,066 --> 01:23:02,936
Just go!
Just go!

1573
01:23:04,544 --> 01:23:07,756
Nancy, I need you
to get in here now!

1574
01:23:07,757 --> 01:23:09,394
I'm coming, Susan.
I'm here, I'm here.

1575
01:23:09,395 --> 01:23:11,215
Pardon, excuse me.

1576
01:23:11,225 --> 01:23:13,674
Okay.
I'm here. I'm here.

1577
01:23:13,675 --> 01:23:14,675
Oh, wow!

1578
01:23:15,289 --> 01:23:18,440
50 Cent a piece.
Thanks for letting me know.

1579
01:23:18,441 --> 01:23:22,190
Do not let Rayna see that woman.
Create a diversion, now!

1580
01:23:22,191 --> 01:23:26,101
- What kind of diversion?
- A big one.

1581
01:23:30,687 --> 01:23:32,287
50, I love you!

1582
01:23:34,729 --> 01:23:37,123
50, I love you!
Kiss me.

1583
01:23:37,124 --> 01:23:39,764
- Get her!
- Take me now!

1584
01:23:43,006 --> 01:23:44,236
Turn around.

1585
01:23:45,105 --> 01:23:47,508
- Get off!
- I'm coming in.

1586
01:23:47,509 --> 01:23:49,346
Nancy, I got her.
Meet me outside.

1587
01:23:49,347 --> 01:23:52,723
Okay, great. No, I'm fine now.
Thank you so much. Okay.

1588
01:23:52,724 --> 01:23:54,440
Now I got my wish.
And that was it.

1589
01:23:54,441 --> 01:23:58,010
For a hob, now I got to drop
Michael Bublé in Croatia. He wants me.

1590
01:23:58,011 --> 01:23:59,962
Okay, Cooper.
I got this under control.

1591
01:23:59,963 --> 01:24:02,243
You're coming with me.

1592
01:24:06,428 --> 01:24:07,952
Oh my god.
Susan!

1593
01:24:07,953 --> 01:24:11,853
Okay, bigger diversion!
Huge diversion!

1594
01:24:15,243 --> 01:24:16,243
Bitch!

1595
01:24:20,821 --> 01:24:26,821
I got to know who she's working for.
Get Rayna out of here.

1596
01:24:32,002 --> 01:24:33,692
That's not fair!

1597
01:24:34,423 --> 01:24:36,153
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

1598
01:24:40,078 --> 01:24:41,358
God damn it!

1599
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:46,076
- Nancy, where are you?
- A bit indispose.

1600
01:24:46,077 --> 01:24:49,473
It turns out 50 Cent doesn't have
a great sense of humor or irony.

1601
01:24:49,474 --> 01:24:53,804
I need backup!
I lost my gun in the club!

1602
01:25:18,094 --> 01:25:19,094
Okay.

1603
01:25:24,372 --> 01:25:28,112
Aw! Why did I get
rid of my gloves?

1604
01:25:36,209 --> 01:25:37,209
Ah!

1605
01:25:44,082 --> 01:25:45,082
AW!

1606
01:25:45,356 --> 01:25:46,546
Ah-ha-ha...

1607
01:25:50,064 --> 01:25:51,924
Aw!
Motherbuttler!

1608
01:26:03,204 --> 01:26:07,304
You got a lot of rage
in that jumpsuit.

1609
01:26:43,835 --> 01:26:45,475
- Get up!
- Aw.

1610
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:53,650
You are under arrest by Susan Cooper
and the government of the United States.

1611
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:03,673
Rayna, how did you do that?

1612
01:27:03,674 --> 01:27:04,814
I didn’t.

1613
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:06,190
He did.

1614
01:27:13,259 --> 01:27:14,489
Hello, Coop.

1615
01:27:18,637 --> 01:27:19,687
Fine.
Aw.

1616
01:27:20,572 --> 01:27:21,572
Hey.

1617
01:27:22,868 --> 01:27:23,868
Coop.

1618
01:27:36,777 --> 01:27:37,777
Wake up!

1619
01:27:38,824 --> 01:27:40,972
Did you have a nice nap?

1620
01:27:40,973 --> 01:27:42,444
You were snoring very loudly.

1621
01:27:42,445 --> 01:27:45,776
Well, this is really not the
most upsetting news right now.

1622
01:27:45,777 --> 01:27:47,676
My father used to
bring people here.

1623
01:27:47,677 --> 01:27:50,912
Did he also make you dressed
like a slutty dolphin trainer?

1624
01:27:50,913 --> 01:27:54,003
He starved them, tortured them.

1625
01:27:54,037 --> 01:27:55,317
You name it.

1626
01:27:55,509 --> 01:27:59,294
But he especially didn't like it
when people lied to him.

1627
01:27:59,295 --> 01:28:01,002
Not that I bought it.

1628
01:28:01,003 --> 01:28:02,835
- You knew?
- Of course I knew.

1629
01:28:02,836 --> 01:28:05,573
I told you you were better
off in the basement, Coop.

1630
01:28:05,574 --> 01:28:08,978
- You could have avoided all of this.
- And what, Fine?

1631
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:12,153
Now you're a nuclear black marketer?
A terrorist?

1632
01:28:12,154 --> 01:28:13,154
No.

1633
01:28:14,457 --> 01:28:16,647
He's just fucking me.

1634
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:26,045
You're a loud kisser.

1635
01:28:26,046 --> 01:28:28,060
- Excuse me?
- You're a loud kisser.

1636
01:28:28,061 --> 01:28:30,323
And it's gross and unappealing.

1637
01:28:30,324 --> 01:28:32,095
You look like some
old toothless woman

1638
01:28:32,096 --> 01:28:34,738
sucking the jelly out of a donut.

1639
01:28:34,739 --> 01:28:37,891
Hey. How's it like sleeping with
the man who killed your father?

1640
01:28:37,892 --> 01:28:39,352
Nice try Coop.

1641
01:28:40,299 --> 01:28:44,697
- She already know it was Cress.
- Ah. Okay.

1642
01:28:44,698 --> 01:28:48,575
You probably always been in love
with him, haven't you?

1643
01:28:48,576 --> 01:28:50,456
Talking in his ear,

1644
01:28:50,457 --> 01:28:55,182
hoping eventually one day
he'll fall in love with you.

1645
01:28:55,183 --> 01:28:57,935
Poor little pathetic Susan Coleman.

1646
01:28:57,936 --> 01:29:01,166
Reminisce my last name so truly
not much of a burden, is it?

1647
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:02,757
- Coppin.
- No.

1648
01:29:03,351 --> 01:29:04,351
Cropon?

1649
01:29:04,567 --> 01:29:07,973
Are you-Are you thinking Groupon?
No, my name is not Groupon.

1650
01:29:07,974 --> 01:29:09,884
Croop?
Keep going.

1651
01:29:09,897 --> 01:29:12,452
- Kapalski.
- It's getting further from it.

1652
01:29:12,453 --> 01:29:14,608
Well.
Whatever the fuck it is,

1653
01:29:14,609 --> 01:29:16,338
Let's just call it Dead!

1654
01:29:16,339 --> 01:29:18,576
Hey, baby. I thought we were
gonna hang on to her till tonight?

1655
01:29:18,577 --> 01:29:20,447
I changed my mind!

1656
01:29:23,514 --> 01:29:24,514
Goodbye.

1657
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:32,440
Like I waste a bullet on you.

1658
01:29:32,966 --> 01:29:35,066
Put her in the room.

1659
01:29:39,559 --> 01:29:40,559
Aw.

1660
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:44,569
Eah!

1661
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:53,680
Hey Aldo.

1662
01:29:54,782 --> 01:29:56,782
Hello captured lady.

1663
01:29:57,108 --> 01:29:58,108
I failed.

1664
01:29:59,752 --> 01:30:01,880
I failed the mission.

1665
01:30:01,881 --> 01:30:03,571
Fine's alive and

1666
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:05,516
he's a traitor.

1667
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,957
Don't be downhearted.

1668
01:30:08,824 --> 01:30:11,014
My mama,
said to me.

1669
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:12,697
Aldo,

1670
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:13,950
life is

1671
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:15,751
full of sorrow

1672
01:30:16,353 --> 01:30:17,763
and surprises.

1673
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:20,205
But a

1674
01:30:21,112 --> 01:30:22,202
magnificent

1675
01:30:23,319 --> 01:30:24,779
pair of bosoms

1676
01:30:26,224 --> 01:30:27,224
will...

1677
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:32,315
Good story.

1678
01:30:45,507 --> 01:30:47,012
- Susan.
- Get away from me.

1679
01:30:47,013 --> 01:30:49,482
No, listen.
I haven't got much time.

1680
01:30:49,483 --> 01:30:51,058
Why did you do it, Fine?

1681
01:30:51,059 --> 01:30:53,390
This was my only way in.

1682
01:30:53,391 --> 01:30:56,449
I had to fake my death
to gain Rayna's trust.

1683
01:30:56,450 --> 01:31:00,469
I jammed the signal.
Popped out my lens. It was easy.

1684
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:03,663
I hated to do it to you, Coop.
But I had to, I had to.

1685
01:31:03,664 --> 01:31:05,219
Rayna knew all about our agents,

1686
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,777
'cause Karen Walker
sold her the names.

1687
01:31:07,778 --> 01:31:10,181
I just couldn't trust anyone at the
agency not to give me away.

1688
01:31:10,182 --> 01:31:11,481
Not even you.

1689
01:31:11,482 --> 01:31:13,384
How would I know
you're telling me the true?

1690
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:15,429
Did Karen Walker
tried to kill you?

1691
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:18,536
- You shot her?
- I'm deep undercover.

1692
01:31:18,537 --> 01:31:21,944
But not so deep that
I can't still protect you.

1693
01:31:21,945 --> 01:31:23,741
Alright.
Look me in the eye.

1694
01:31:23,742 --> 01:31:27,472
- Huh?
- Really. Look me in the eye.

1695
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:31,133
One of your eyes is
bigger than the other.

1696
01:31:31,134 --> 01:31:32,724
- Really?
- No.

1697
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:36,509
You're perfect.
God damn it.

1698
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:37,510
Asshole.

1699
01:31:39,533 --> 01:31:41,443
- Ou!
- That hurt.

1700
01:31:41,636 --> 01:31:43,791
Good, it's suppose to.

1701
01:31:43,792 --> 01:31:45,263
- Bosom.
- Huh?

1702
01:31:45,264 --> 01:31:48,943
- Is he dangerous?
- Only if you have boobs.

1703
01:31:48,944 --> 01:31:51,344
So. Does Rayna really
know I was a spy?

1704
01:31:51,345 --> 01:31:52,345
No.

1705
01:31:52,501 --> 01:31:54,794
Not until you blew your cover
back at that kitchen.

1706
01:31:54,795 --> 01:31:57,282
I really thought she was
more experienced than that.

1707
01:31:57,283 --> 01:32:00,212
Thank God she's not.
Because if she was,

1708
01:32:00,213 --> 01:32:01,730
you would be dead now.

1709
01:32:01,731 --> 01:32:04,613
- I used your pretty good covers...
- I got to go.

1710
01:32:04,614 --> 01:32:06,905
We're heading to De Luca De villa
to meet with Dudaev.

1711
01:32:06,906 --> 01:32:09,636
Then we're taking him
to wherever the bomb is.

1712
01:32:09,637 --> 01:32:12,277
This thing is almost over.

1713
01:32:12,551 --> 01:32:13,691
Hang tight.

1714
01:32:18,557 --> 01:32:20,377
Hello, bound lady.

1715
01:32:20,901 --> 01:32:22,325
Not now, Aldo.

1716
01:32:22,326 --> 01:32:26,006
I think Mr. Fine
underestimated you.

1717
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:28,567
You found your target,
you tracked them down.

1718
01:32:28,568 --> 01:32:30,367
You fought very hard.

1719
01:32:30,368 --> 01:32:31,368
Susan.

1720
01:32:33,212 --> 01:32:35,312
You're a good agent.

1721
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:40,175
You'll get them next time, huh?

1722
01:32:40,797 --> 01:32:42,757
Unless we die here.

1723
01:32:45,438 --> 01:32:47,128
Maybe we'll not.

1724
01:32:47,526 --> 01:32:49,683
You know what?
I'm not going down like this.

1725
01:32:49,684 --> 01:32:51,213
I need you to untie me.

1726
01:32:51,214 --> 01:32:53,502
No. You heard Mr. Fine.
He's working a plan.

1727
01:32:53,503 --> 01:32:57,553
- We have to stay put.
- Untie me. Now!

1728
01:33:00,035 --> 01:33:01,415
That's my ass!

1729
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:04,439
It is very difficult to see
or gauge my position.

1730
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,588
You're just simply
grabbing my ass.

1731
01:33:06,589 --> 01:33:08,654
Let's roll to our side.

1732
01:33:08,655 --> 01:33:10,115
God! Oh!
Aye!

1733
01:33:11,264 --> 01:33:14,346
The knot is very tight,
but I am making progress.

1734
01:33:14,347 --> 01:33:15,804
You hand is
way up in there.

1735
01:33:15,805 --> 01:33:19,991
My right hand is restraint
from the weight of my body.

1736
01:33:19,992 --> 01:33:22,182
Okay.
I got an idea.

1737
01:33:22,507 --> 01:33:23,607
Oh my god.

1738
01:33:24,233 --> 01:33:26,218
- Oh Jesus.
- Don't move.

1739
01:33:26,219 --> 01:33:27,866
- Wait, wait. Wait.
- Stay still.

1740
01:33:27,867 --> 01:33:30,442
- No-no-no...
- Yes-yes-yes...

1741
01:33:30,443 --> 01:33:32,189
- Good god.
- Scusa.

1742
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,503
Can't be happening.

1743
01:33:33,504 --> 01:33:37,996
God damn it. I was having such an
empowering moment before you started.

1744
01:33:37,997 --> 01:33:38,997
My penis

1745
01:33:39,897 --> 01:33:41,548
may be gently kissing

1746
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:43,169
the back of your head.

1747
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:45,099
Just untie me before
I crush your nuts!

1748
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,924
Oh, please!
If only we had time for

1749
01:33:47,925 --> 01:33:49,425
such pleasures.

1750
01:33:49,808 --> 01:33:50,808
God!

1751
01:33:51,185 --> 01:33:53,235
Oh, stop licking it!

1752
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:59,450
- It is done.
- Thank you Aldo.

1753
01:33:59,451 --> 01:34:01,340
I don't want to know
why my neck is wet but

1754
01:34:01,341 --> 01:34:03,170
- you did excellent work.
- Prego.

1755
01:34:03,171 --> 01:34:05,408
Okay. Turn around.
Let me untie you

1756
01:34:05,409 --> 01:34:09,149
and let's get the
fuck out of here.

1757
01:34:11,663 --> 01:34:12,663
Stop!

1758
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:54,146
I need you to alert
CIA and Interpol.

1759
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:56,117
I'm going to De Luca's
and backup Fine.

1760
01:34:56,118 --> 01:34:58,988
You know where the villa is?

1761
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:01,598
I know everything.

1762
01:35:01,904 --> 01:35:05,674
One day, Lady superspy.
Susan Cooper.

1763
01:35:06,705 --> 01:35:08,395
I will fuck you.

1764
01:35:49,554 --> 01:35:52,014
Love this new car smell.

1765
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:53,360
Really nice.

1766
01:35:55,856 --> 01:35:56,856
Mmm.

1767
01:36:46,072 --> 01:36:48,373
Welcome to Lake Balaton.

1768
01:36:48,374 --> 01:36:52,579
I found this staircase and made
them built a house around it.

1769
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:56,560
Our dear Mr. Dudaev
will be arriving shortly.

1770
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:57,561
You.

1771
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,809
are about to become
a very rich woman, Rayna.

1772
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:05,195
Which means you'll have to be a little
more careful about the company you keep.

1773
01:37:05,196 --> 01:37:06,929
So many people have such

1774
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:08,610
terrible agendas.

1775
01:37:08,736 --> 01:37:11,143
Like perhaps,
your friend here.

1776
01:37:11,144 --> 01:37:14,784
I can see his obvious
outer appeal.

1777
01:37:14,901 --> 01:37:17,019
You've terrific eyes.

1778
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:18,020
Thanks.

1779
01:37:18,287 --> 01:37:20,807
But he also works for
the CIA, doesn't he?

1780
01:37:20,808 --> 01:37:22,357
Mr. De Luca, it's true.

1781
01:37:22,358 --> 01:37:25,308
I worked for the CIA.
But they think I'm dead.

1782
01:37:25,309 --> 01:37:29,441
You and Karen Walker,
both double agents.

1783
01:37:29,442 --> 01:37:31,356
What's going on in the CIA?

1784
01:37:31,357 --> 01:37:35,127
Drones taken all the cool assignments?

1785
01:37:35,626 --> 01:37:37,119
If we don't get rid
of him right now,

1786
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:39,720
I'm calling off the deal.

1787
01:37:40,288 --> 01:37:42,658
Don't you fucking dare.

1788
01:37:42,662 --> 01:37:44,124
Yeah. Why don't you
listen to that, asshole.

1789
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:46,495
Don't you fucking dare.

1790
01:37:46,678 --> 01:37:49,935
You're a bit outnumbered here.
Miss...

1791
01:37:49,936 --> 01:37:51,645
I'm sorry,
what the fuck is your name?

1792
01:37:51,646 --> 01:37:54,087
Susan Cooper.
I'm with the CIA.

1793
01:37:54,088 --> 01:37:57,133
Jesus. Rayna, did you invite
the entire agency here

1794
01:37:57,134 --> 01:37:59,012
or are they just having a

1795
01:37:59,013 --> 01:38:01,076
company retreat at
the villa next door.

1796
01:38:01,077 --> 01:38:02,816
God, you're funny.
Huh.

1797
01:38:02,817 --> 01:38:05,022
It's just me.
As could be in your best interest

1798
01:38:05,023 --> 01:38:06,899
to keep Fine and me alive.

1799
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:10,071
I'm trying, but I not quite
following your logic.

1800
01:38:10,072 --> 01:38:11,880
You want me to slow it
down for you. Okay.

1801
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:13,318
You're about to meet
with Solsa Dudaev.

1802
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:16,684
A man I've been collecting
intelligence on for years.

1803
01:38:16,685 --> 01:38:20,004
And I'm guessing your boys here
are too busy manscaping

1804
01:38:20,005 --> 01:38:21,912
to tell you how
he does business.

1805
01:38:21,913 --> 01:38:24,189
It's about half the people
he deals with end up dead.

1806
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,849
I'll tell you another thing.
Your little girlfriend,

1807
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:28,606
one from the Paris bombing.

1808
01:38:28,607 --> 01:38:30,722
She's just using you
to get to Rayna.

1809
01:38:30,723 --> 01:38:33,970
If it hadn't for me last night, she
would have kidnapped her at the club.

1810
01:38:33,971 --> 01:38:35,932
And you would be standing
here with your dick in your hand,

1811
01:38:35,933 --> 01:38:37,462
because you'd never find that bomb.

1812
01:38:37,463 --> 01:38:39,484
So.
You need me, De Luca.

1813
01:38:39,485 --> 01:38:45,405
And I'm not going to help you
unless you keep Fine alive.

1814
01:38:47,992 --> 01:38:49,443
So.
Let me get this straight.

1815
01:38:49,444 --> 01:38:51,044
You work for the CIA.

1816
01:38:51,045 --> 01:38:53,593
Yet you're willing to help
me sell a nuclear bomb,

1817
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:55,413
in order to save this man's life.

1818
01:38:55,414 --> 01:39:00,308
- Why would I believe that?
- Because she's in love with him.

1819
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:03,285
Yeah, so what?
This idiot doesn't even know it.

1820
01:39:03,286 --> 01:39:07,226
Too dump to know
I'll do anything for him.

1821
01:39:07,227 --> 01:39:09,234
Look.
Fuck the CIA, right.

1822
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:10,789
What did they
ever done for me?

1823
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:13,031
Took 10 years of my life,
give me shitty pay.

1824
01:39:13,032 --> 01:39:15,812
Put me in the basement
with a ceiling full of bats.

1825
01:39:15,813 --> 01:39:18,228
Pretty sure give me a pink eye
or at least an allergy.

1826
01:39:18,229 --> 01:39:21,331
Something got fuck up in my eye.

1827
01:39:21,332 --> 01:39:25,885
I would have mal a long time ago
if it hadn't been for Fine.

1828
01:39:25,886 --> 01:39:26,886
So, yeah.

1829
01:39:27,314 --> 01:39:30,977
I'll do anything it takes
to keep him alive.

1830
01:39:30,978 --> 01:39:33,978
That's pretty pathetic, right?

1831
01:39:33,998 --> 01:39:35,858
Extremely pathetic.

1832
01:39:35,988 --> 01:39:37,423
God, you're an asshole.

1833
01:39:37,424 --> 01:39:40,976
When this is over,
I'm gonna shave that fucking head.

1834
01:39:40,977 --> 01:39:43,020
Alright, Miss Hair Vision.

1835
01:39:43,021 --> 01:39:44,547
I'll take you up on your offer.

1836
01:39:44,548 --> 01:39:48,457
But if you try anything,
I mean anything.

1837
01:39:48,458 --> 01:39:53,710
I'll make your dream come true and
send you and your boyfriend to heaven.

1838
01:39:53,711 --> 01:39:54,721
Let's go.

1839
01:40:07,981 --> 01:40:09,121
Mr. Dudaev.

1840
01:40:09,653 --> 01:40:11,182
Welcome to Hungary.

1841
01:40:11,183 --> 01:40:14,791
Like Chechnya,
only easier to pronounce.

1842
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:17,292
Enough with the bullshit.

1843
01:40:17,674 --> 01:40:19,451
Where is the package?

1844
01:40:19,452 --> 01:40:22,682
Once my client sees the payment.

1845
01:40:22,689 --> 01:40:25,702
She'll take us all to
it's very secure hiding spot.

1846
01:40:25,703 --> 01:40:27,843
Wherever that may be.

1847
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:38,390
I got it, handsome.

1848
01:40:39,628 --> 01:40:45,318
100 million euros doesn't buy
what it used to, does it?

1849
01:40:45,848 --> 01:40:47,488
Nice ice, Solsa.

1850
01:40:49,423 --> 01:40:50,423
Right.

1851
01:40:51,567 --> 01:40:53,031
It's all yours.

1852
01:40:53,032 --> 01:40:56,532
Gentlemen.
If you would follow me.

1853
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,216
- Here it is.
- What is this bullshit?

1854
01:41:25,217 --> 01:41:26,217
Bullshit?

1855
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:28,696
Solsa, I'll have you know.

1856
01:41:28,697 --> 01:41:30,207
It's the nuke.

1857
01:41:31,459 --> 01:41:32,689
Clever girl.

1858
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:41,307
Huh.
A lead lined compartment.

1859
01:41:41,308 --> 01:41:45,569
Correct. The lead lining is said
to mask any radiation detection.

1860
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:47,799
My father was extremely
good at his job.

1861
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:50,871
Unbelievable! You know.
You could have warned me, Rayna.

1862
01:41:50,872 --> 01:41:56,872
I have been throwing my gym clothes
in that uh-uh thing for a week.

1863
01:42:10,048 --> 01:42:12,188
It is beautiful, huh?

1864
01:42:12,364 --> 01:42:13,554
Yes, it is.

1865
01:42:18,824 --> 01:42:20,827
What the fuck are you doing?

1866
01:42:20,828 --> 01:42:22,778
Conducting business.

1867
01:42:28,029 --> 01:42:29,219
Uh-uh-uh...

1868
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:32,757
Put it in the helicopter.

1869
01:42:32,758 --> 01:42:35,308
Don't forget my diamonds.

1870
01:42:37,659 --> 01:42:39,230
What the fuck is going on?

1871
01:42:39,231 --> 01:42:42,301
De Luca played you, Rayna.
And you lead him right to it.

1872
01:42:42,302 --> 01:42:44,679
You didn't expect me to
let him have it, did you?

1873
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,575
I mean. Like giving a
strafe of areas to a hillbilly.

1874
01:42:47,576 --> 01:42:51,519
I have a buyer who is willing to
pay me 500 million euros for it.

1875
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,624
And Dudaev would've never be able
to get that bomb onto American soil.

1876
01:42:55,625 --> 01:43:00,150
My buyer will have it in the middle
of New York city and use it next week.

1877
01:43:00,151 --> 01:43:03,459
So, you know.
If you haven't seen "Phantom" yet...

1878
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:04,460
So what?

1879
01:43:05,511 --> 01:43:07,887
Does this me you're going
to kill me too, Sergio?

1880
01:43:07,888 --> 01:43:09,398
I'm afraid so.

1881
01:43:10,103 --> 01:43:12,829
Sorry Rayna. It's just cleaner
that way, you understand.

1882
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:15,520
Explain it to me, De Luca!

1883
01:43:21,144 --> 01:43:23,834
Oh God.
He-He means well.

1884
01:43:23,951 --> 01:43:27,374
At this stage,
it keeps getting better and better.

1885
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:33,375
Thank for the performance folks.
But. Sorry, Rayna, the show's over.

1886
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:38,640
Go!
Go!

1887
01:43:57,269 --> 01:43:58,319
Holy shit!

1888
01:43:58,671 --> 01:44:01,491
- Where's De Luca?
- Susan!

1889
01:44:01,969 --> 01:44:02,969
Get down!

1890
01:44:04,364 --> 01:44:05,364
No!

1891
01:44:12,233 --> 01:44:14,552
I should have killed
when I had the chance.

1892
01:44:14,553 --> 01:44:15,937
- Rayna.
- What?

1893
01:44:15,938 --> 01:44:17,398
Under the car.

1894
01:44:18,016 --> 01:44:19,386
Push it over.

1895
01:44:21,275 --> 01:44:22,206
Seriously?

1896
01:44:22,207 --> 01:44:26,897
Can't you just fucking
burn arms and push it.

1897
01:44:31,879 --> 01:44:33,069
Ha-ha-ha...

1898
01:44:33,762 --> 01:44:34,762
Aw!

1899
01:44:35,745 --> 01:44:38,262
What happened?
Did I get him?

1900
01:44:38,263 --> 01:44:40,914
De Luke has got the bomb
to the helicopter. Get up!

1901
01:44:40,915 --> 01:44:43,515
Ah, fuck me.
I got this.

1902
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:51,850
No!

1903
01:44:51,926 --> 01:44:53,976
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

1904
01:44:54,743 --> 01:44:55,743
Come on!

1905
01:45:00,809 --> 01:45:01,809
Kill her.

1906
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:06,790
I got this.
I've done this before!

1907
01:45:10,058 --> 01:45:11,900
I bet you're gonna
fuck this up!

1908
01:45:11,901 --> 01:45:13,681
Shut up and help!

1909
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:20,330
Are you kidding me?

1910
01:45:24,552 --> 01:45:26,343
Ford, what the hell
are you doing?

1911
01:45:26,344 --> 01:45:29,968
I'm gonna crawl up you
and take out De Luca.

1912
01:45:29,969 --> 01:45:31,339
Get your hands off my boobs!

1913
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:32,655
I'm saving you!

1914
01:45:32,656 --> 01:45:34,899
Oh my god.
Those do not belong on those!

1915
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:39,681
I can't get a good grip.
Your pants are too slippery.

1916
01:45:39,682 --> 01:45:42,417
Hold on tight! I'm gonna swing
like I'm on a trapeze.

1917
01:45:42,418 --> 01:45:44,934
And leap my way up
to the COCKPIT!

1918
01:45:44,935 --> 01:45:45,935
Awww!

1919
01:45:47,452 --> 01:45:52,142
I told you you're gonna
fuck this up, Cooper!

1920
01:45:55,537 --> 01:45:56,817
Oh, I split.

1921
01:45:57,807 --> 01:45:59,540
Woo, that's high!

1922
01:45:59,541 --> 01:46:00,541
Ohh!

1923
01:46:05,963 --> 01:46:07,243
God damn it.

1924
01:46:09,011 --> 01:46:10,741
Fucking new suit.

1925
01:46:10,903 --> 01:46:12,863
This shit ends now!

1926
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:16,711
- Freeze!
- Oh my god!

1927
01:46:16,712 --> 01:46:18,799
I'm not in the fucking mood
for your bullshit!

1928
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:22,080
Oh yeah?
Then you'll love this!

1929
01:46:22,301 --> 01:46:23,975
I'm not in the mood

1930
01:46:23,976 --> 01:46:25,796
for your bullshit!

1931
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,200
Back off.

1932
01:46:28,129 --> 01:46:30,378
Sorry, spy.
Play time's over.

1933
01:46:30,379 --> 01:46:32,501
Yeah, it is.
Say goodbye to your toy.

1934
01:46:32,502 --> 01:46:33,938
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Do not you dare!

1935
01:46:33,939 --> 01:46:36,309
Oh my god!
The stones!

1936
01:46:37,892 --> 01:46:39,492
No!
Oh my god!

1937
01:46:54,621 --> 01:46:55,621
Die.

1938
01:47:00,235 --> 01:47:01,235
Woo-hoo.

1939
01:47:02,025 --> 01:47:03,754
I just shot a man!

1940
01:47:03,755 --> 01:47:06,449
Is it wrong?
It felt so right.

1941
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:07,690
It's so me!

1942
01:47:10,188 --> 01:47:11,918
Hey, heroic lady!

1943
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:16,660
In my country there is a saying
about women like you.

1944
01:47:16,661 --> 01:47:17,941
Hot as fuck!

1945
01:47:18,321 --> 01:47:20,691
Oh god.
Not now, Aldo!

1946
01:47:20,972 --> 01:47:21,972
Go Susan!

1947
01:47:22,326 --> 01:47:26,066
Oh!
That was not a part of my plan!

1948
01:47:27,969 --> 01:47:31,267
Just like a women.
To wear jewelry into battle.

1949
01:47:31,268 --> 01:47:34,275
Although this is the ugliest
fucking necklace I've ever seen.

1950
01:47:34,276 --> 01:47:36,496
Yes, it is.
And it's all yours.

1951
01:47:36,497 --> 01:47:39,087
With an adjustable toggle!

1952
01:47:51,474 --> 01:47:53,842
Okay, here we go.
No problem.

1953
01:47:53,843 --> 01:47:54,843
Come on!

1954
01:47:55,788 --> 01:47:59,118
Okay, okay.
I got it. I got it.

1955
01:48:05,715 --> 01:48:07,827
Nice copter.
Where did you get it?

1956
01:48:07,828 --> 01:48:09,478
It's 50 Cent's.

1957
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:12,592
I had to deputize him
to let us use it.

1958
01:48:12,593 --> 01:48:14,585
He is so afraid of me.

1959
01:48:14,586 --> 01:48:16,259
I'm a motherfucking spy.

1960
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:17,819
Let's go shoot somebody else.

1961
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:21,452
Oh, zip it up, 50 Cent
or I'll mouth you again!

1962
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:23,714
This day is just getting
better and better.

1963
01:48:23,715 --> 01:48:24,995
He wants me!

1964
01:48:26,378 --> 01:48:28,395
I think we should land!

1965
01:48:28,396 --> 01:48:31,496
I dropped a nuke in the water.

1966
01:48:44,263 --> 01:48:46,502
Good job guys.
Sorry about the lake.

1967
01:48:46,503 --> 01:48:48,042
Alright, muscle.
Don't push.

1968
01:48:48,043 --> 01:48:50,639
You'll get your pictures.
There's enough 50 to go around.

1969
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,067
You know I just help
because of terrorist, right?

1970
01:48:52,068 --> 01:48:53,584
You ever seen Kanye
do some shit like that.

1971
01:48:53,585 --> 01:48:55,635
He never.
He never.

1972
01:48:59,048 --> 01:49:00,633
Well.
Isn't this wonderful?

1973
01:49:00,634 --> 01:49:03,208
I was hoping to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

1974
01:49:03,209 --> 01:49:05,017
Give me some quality time
to deal with the fact

1975
01:49:05,018 --> 01:49:07,814
that I was sleeping with the man
who killed my father.

1976
01:49:07,815 --> 01:49:10,580
Anyway, call my lawyer.
Get the turf from the hotel.

1977
01:49:10,581 --> 01:49:13,513
- I need everything on time...
- Do you think I still work for you?

1978
01:49:13,514 --> 01:49:15,514
Whatever.
Fuck you.

1979
01:49:16,279 --> 01:49:18,969
I knew you really like me.

1980
01:49:20,249 --> 01:49:21,249
Hey.

1981
01:49:23,496 --> 01:49:24,866
Fuck you too.

1982
01:49:30,036 --> 01:49:32,906
Don't touch my fucking hair.

1983
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:34,980
Watch it.

1984
01:49:39,652 --> 01:49:41,022
Oh god, Aldo.

1985
01:49:41,153 --> 01:49:44,294
I'm-I'm too tired to fend
you off your groping.

1986
01:49:44,295 --> 01:49:47,515
Please.
I understand completely.

1987
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:50,631
Look.
My real name is Albert.

1988
01:49:50,723 --> 01:49:51,723
MI6.

1989
01:49:51,761 --> 01:49:54,513
Look. I'm sorry if my
disguise was a bit much.

1990
01:49:54,514 --> 01:49:56,370
I just like to really
get into character.

1991
01:49:56,371 --> 01:50:00,763
Although I fear I may have become
over excited at certain points.

1992
01:50:00,764 --> 01:50:03,142
- A little bit.
- By way of apology.

1993
01:50:03,143 --> 01:50:06,070
Should your work ever
bring you to London

1994
01:50:06,071 --> 01:50:08,538
I would love
to take you for dinner.

1995
01:50:08,539 --> 01:50:10,269
Okay. Yeah.
I...

1996
01:50:10,283 --> 01:50:11,654
That would be nice.

1997
01:50:11,655 --> 01:50:12,655
Wonderful.

1998
01:50:17,118 --> 01:50:18,118
God!

1999
01:50:18,454 --> 01:50:21,318
How do you like my
English accent? Huh?

2000
01:50:21,319 --> 01:50:24,585
I learned it from
the Downton Abbey.

2001
01:50:24,586 --> 01:50:26,686
No, I'm only joking.

2002
01:50:26,877 --> 01:50:29,067
- Or am I.
- My god.

2003
01:50:30,681 --> 01:50:32,501
Coop.
Great work.

2004
01:50:32,787 --> 01:50:34,962
What a job!
SuperCooper.

2005
01:50:34,963 --> 01:50:36,499
- Really, amazing.
- Thanks.

2006
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:38,890
Yes, it was.
You really came through.

2007
01:50:38,891 --> 01:50:39,958
Thank you ma'am.

2008
01:50:39,959 --> 01:50:42,044
I like to keep you out
in the field for now.

2009
01:50:42,045 --> 01:50:43,045
Wow.

2010
01:50:43,132 --> 01:50:44,795
We need you to fly
to Prague tomorrow

2011
01:50:44,796 --> 01:50:47,682
to infiltrate an international
drug smuggling ring.

2012
01:50:47,683 --> 01:50:50,233
Here's your new identity.

2013
01:50:51,473 --> 01:50:53,023
You in, Cooper?

2014
01:50:53,512 --> 01:50:55,815
Agent, Susan Cooper.
Reporting for duty, ma'am.

2015
01:50:55,816 --> 01:50:58,609
Yeah. Nobody says or
does that but great.

2016
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:00,340
Okay.
Thank you.

2017
01:51:01,232 --> 01:51:03,507
Francis Mays is an
unemployed telemarketer

2018
01:51:03,508 --> 01:51:04,823
living off her disability cheques.

2019
01:51:04,824 --> 01:51:06,464
Oh, sweet Jesus!

2020
01:51:06,797 --> 01:51:09,431
Any who wears reading glasses
in their passport photo?

2021
01:51:09,432 --> 01:51:12,802
She's only kidding.
She got you.

2022
01:51:13,412 --> 01:51:16,562
Oh my god.
It was a good one.

2023
01:51:17,444 --> 01:51:19,638
Yeah, actually I'm not.
I don't have a sense of humor.

2024
01:51:19,639 --> 01:51:22,233
- No, you don't.
- We'll talk soon.

2025
01:51:22,234 --> 01:51:24,228
Got the pink eyes under control.

2026
01:51:24,229 --> 01:51:26,393
But...
It was actually an allergy, ma'am.

2027
01:51:26,394 --> 01:51:27,854
Okay.
Got it.

2028
01:51:27,941 --> 01:51:29,657
So.
You're a spy now, Coop.

2029
01:51:29,658 --> 01:51:30,658
Yeah.

2030
01:51:30,896 --> 01:51:33,315
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

2031
01:51:33,316 --> 01:51:37,056
I don't think I'll ever find anyone
as good as you in the basement.

2032
01:51:37,057 --> 01:51:38,057
Well.

2033
01:51:38,339 --> 01:51:43,239
I think you will. There's a lot
of good people down there.

2034
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,799
So, hey.
The thing is.

2035
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:48,928
I know a great little restaurant
right near here. Maybe

2036
01:51:48,929 --> 01:51:51,449
you and I
could go for a nice long

2037
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:52,450
dinner.

2038
01:51:59,174 --> 01:52:00,536
You know what.
I just

2039
01:52:00,537 --> 01:52:03,810
got a feeling like a
a girl's night.

2040
01:52:03,811 --> 01:52:07,294
- You understand, right?
- Yeah, sure.

2041
01:52:07,295 --> 01:52:09,674
I'll catch you later.
You go have a great time.

2042
01:52:09,675 --> 01:52:10,725
Thank you.

2043
01:52:12,230 --> 01:52:13,370
Hey.
Coop.

2044
01:52:14,325 --> 01:52:19,105
All those things you said
about me to De Luca.

2045
01:52:19,356 --> 01:52:21,226
Did you mean that?

2046
01:52:21,916 --> 01:52:24,692
You're a lot furrier than
I thought you'd be.

2047
01:52:24,693 --> 01:52:26,042
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

2048
01:52:26,043 --> 01:52:28,183
Smell you later, pal.

2049
01:52:28,795 --> 01:52:30,422
Glad you're still alive
Beverly.

2050
01:52:30,423 --> 01:52:33,503
- You silly fucking girly wanker.
- Aw! God!

2051
01:52:33,504 --> 01:52:35,324
Nice work, Cooper.

2052
01:52:35,573 --> 01:52:38,021
Wow.
Is that a compliment?

2053
01:52:38,022 --> 01:52:39,524
That's not easy
for you to do.

2054
01:52:39,525 --> 01:52:41,287
Ah fuck it.
Look, you did a good job.

2055
01:52:41,288 --> 01:52:42,934
Probably just beginner's luck though.

2056
01:52:42,935 --> 01:52:44,217
Ah, there we go.

2057
01:52:44,218 --> 01:52:47,238
- Where did you get that suit?
- I fucking made it, didn't I.

2058
01:52:47,239 --> 01:52:50,409
It's nice.
You're still out of the CIA?

2059
01:52:50,410 --> 01:52:52,172
Probably not.
They need me.

2060
01:52:52,173 --> 01:52:54,608
I think I need to spend some
time on my own first, though.

2061
01:52:54,609 --> 01:52:56,069
Clear my head.

2062
01:52:56,682 --> 01:52:58,927
I'm going to take
this down the coast.

2063
01:52:58,928 --> 01:53:02,868
Maybe, spend some time in Italy.
Travel to Greece.

2064
01:53:02,869 --> 01:53:05,990
Sometimes a man
needs to go to sea.

2065
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:09,311
Sounds good, Ford.
Good for you.

2066
01:53:09,337 --> 01:53:10,387
Take care.

2067
01:53:11,211 --> 01:53:12,211
Bye.

2068
01:53:14,422 --> 01:53:15,692
Arrivederci!

2069
01:53:18,549 --> 01:53:24,109
- Do you think he knows that's a lake?
- No. I don't.

2070
01:53:27,173 --> 01:53:28,974
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2071
01:53:28,975 --> 01:53:31,184
I can't let anybody see
how sore I am.

2072
01:53:31,185 --> 01:53:32,593
- I got you.
- Okay.

2073
01:53:32,594 --> 01:53:35,972
- Come here.
- Oh, my glutes are really season up

2074
01:53:35,973 --> 01:53:37,526
If you're sore,
I'll tell you what.

2075
01:53:37,527 --> 01:53:39,515
Take a hot bath and then
we get to celebrate.

2076
01:53:39,516 --> 01:53:43,118
- I hope you like champagne and beef
jerky. - Well. Oh, that's a...

2077
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:45,699
You have to.
Because I stole a case of it.

2078
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:49,368
- I don't know if I like them together.
- Out of 50 Cent's helicopter.

2079
01:53:49,369 --> 01:53:51,369
Oh.
Slower. Slower.

2080
01:53:51,456 --> 01:53:54,826
Come on!
Is this a fucking lake?

2081
01:53:55,402 --> 01:53:58,642
How the fuck do I get to Italy?

2082
01:54:15,839 --> 01:54:19,249
Oh, stop screaming.
You loved it.

2083
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:21,319
Oh god.

2084
01:54:34,774 --> 01:54:40,774
