1
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,003
Pleased to meet you.

2
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,013
Pleased to meet you.

3
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,983
Two of the horses run off, but
that pinto you're riding hung around.

4
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,052
You got no idea what
they were after?

5
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,496
Offend anybody lately?

6
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,694
Not for five years.

7
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,932
- Jefferson City?
- No. Leavenworth.

8
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,272
Never been in there.

9
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,980
They jumped you
out of the blue?

10
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,849
I had to get up anyway.

11
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,147
Me, I'm riding along
minding my own business.

12
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:10,958
Four cowboys come by, and we decide
to ride together. Friendly as can be.

13
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,160
I figure you should approach life like
everybody's your friend or nobody is.

14
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,202
Don't make much difference.

15
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,263
Suddenly everybody's
pointing their gun but me.

16
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,133
Guess they admired my horse.

17
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:29,045
Looks like that's not all
they admired.

18
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,846
Yep. My whole rig.

19
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,888
I don't care much about the rest...

20
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,322
but I surely will miss
that bay.

21
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,819
At least they didn't kill me.

22
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,923
That was right considerate,
I thought.

23
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,067
They were laughing
when they left me.

24
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,503
Thought it was real funny.

25
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:02,576
I walked for a little while,
but it was no use so I gave it up.

26
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,617
Figured it was just bad luck.

27
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,187
Looks like those boys
are headed south...

28
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,689
so they weren't the same ones
that jumped me.

29
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,886
Where are you going?

30
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,692
Where's the pinto going?

31
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,502
I'll get these horses tended to.

32
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,817
I'm good for it.

33
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,852
Just a minute. When I'm done
helping the lady, I'll come here...

34
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,987
I'll take this one.

35
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,400
This one is $20.

36
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:40,411
- How much to borrow it?
- The guns are for sale.

37
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,475
What can I get for that?

38
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,564
Look, Mal

39
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,689
This is the man, Sergeant.

40
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,323
He claims the animal was stolen.

41
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,502
How do I know
this is your horse?

42
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,803
Can't you see this horse loves me?

43
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,868
I had a gal do that to me.
It didn't make her my wife.

44
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,074
On the underside of that saddle
I got my name scratched.

45
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,242
Take a look and you'll see.

46
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:57,282
- And what would your name be?
- Paden.

47
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,461
P-A-D-E-N.

48
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,066
Hello, Cobb.

49
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,867
Hello, Paden.

50
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,905
How're you doing?

51
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,873
You know this man?

52
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,139
I surely do.

53
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,581
Troopers, let's take a look
at this saddle.

54
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,781
All right.

55
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,884
Move along, folks.
Get these children out of here.

56
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,557
And you, get some clothes on.

57
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,764
I see you've been prospering
without me.

58
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,506
It's been a while.

59
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,304
Where's the dog?

60
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,983
Appreciate the loan.

61
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,913
I'm good for it.

62
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,755
Let's talk about that.

63
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,092
I'm looking for some men.

64
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,735
- I've given that up.
- So have I.

65
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,935
I've got a legitimate job now.
I could use a guy like you.

66
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,538
You've got a legitimate job?

67
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,946
Yes, sir, you wouldn't believe it.

68
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,677
You're right.

69
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,321
This is mighty sweet, Paden.

70
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:41,086
I think I finally found my place
in the world.

71
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,359
Well, I'm...

72
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,421
real happy for you, Cobb.

73
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,192
But I think I'll just
keep looking for mine.

74
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,367
He's getting out.

75
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,809
Come on, Paden.
This oughta interest you.

76
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,120
Look who's here, Tyree.

77
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,072
Our old ridin' buddy.

78
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,071
I invited Paden to join us...

79
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,379
but he's not having any.

80
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,397
Where's the dog?

81
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,827
You owe me $13.

82
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,207
Thirteen.

83
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,212
Bad luck.

84
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,516
I see what you like.

85
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,526
She's mighty pretty.

86
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,188
And bridle-wise, too.

87
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,562
The only thing I lost
I really cared about...

88
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,431
except for maybe my hat.

89
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:34,836
It's a great one.
Black with a pretty silver band on it.

90
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,535
My head spent three years
training it.

91
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,171
Sure do miss that hat.

92
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,148
I got to be going.

93
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,117
Going to Turley, was it?

94
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:52,590
Yeah. I gotta stop off there,
meet a guy. Head out for Silverado.

95
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,261
What's Turley like?

96
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,193
It's a town.

97
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,794
Got a saloon?

98
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,702
I expect.

99
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,775
Women?

100
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,572
I expect.

101
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,792
Baxter! Hawley!
Where the hell you been?

102
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,237
You're late, and I tell you
I don't like it. It's a bad start.

103
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,743
I got my people down there
throwing snowballs and rearing to go!

104
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,543
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend.
My name ain't Baxter. He ain't Hawley.

105
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,776
- You're not Baxter?
- Name's Emmett.

106
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,251
- You're not Baxter, either?
- No. I'm not Hawley.

107
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,720
Goddamn it!

108
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,782
They ain't Baxter and Hawleyl
Where the hell is Baxter and Hawley?

109
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,420
Quit yelling, you old coot.
We're right here.

110
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,158
Who you calling a coot?

111
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,633
Calm down, Mr. Hobart.
I'm Nord Baxter.

112
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,865
- There's my partner, Tom Hawley.
- You're late. It's a bab start.

113
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,499
Yes. That means we'II have to get you
to Silverado that much quicker.

114
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,566
All right. Let's get goin'!

115
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:29,102
You remember my letter, don't you?
Half now and half when we get there.

116
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,308
I remember.
Open the box.

117
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,017
Thank you.

118
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,586
- Don't you even want to count it?
- Not at all, friend.

119
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,598
We trust you.

120
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,034
Let's get this wagon train
to Silverado.

121
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,798
You bet!

122
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,109
What do you want?

123
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:36,307
I haven't had a whiskey
or slept in a bed in ten days.

124
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,917
Give me a bottle.

125
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:59,232
Hey, what are you doing, buck?

126
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,273
Having a drink.

127
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,873
No, you're not.
Get outta here.

128
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:18,354
I haven't had a whiskey
or slept in a bed in ten days.

129
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,392
You ain't gettin' it here.

130
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,826
I'm real sorry to hear that.

131
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,397
- Doesn't look quite fair.
- Which way do you mean?

132
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,661
What's all this then?

133
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,499
This nigger's breaking up my place,
Sheriff Langston.

134
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,232
I don't like that word much,
Carter.

135
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,139
We don't serve them here
and you know it.

136
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,235
I asked him to leave
and he went crazy on us!

137
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:17,271
- Now he owes me money for this damage.
- Is that a fact?

138
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:21,479
Afraid not, Sheriff.
These other fellas started the ruckus.

139
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,386
Are these your friends?

140
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,924
I wanted a drink and a bed.

141
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,927
- Guess I came to the wrong place.
- Came to the wrong town.

142
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:35,558
I don't tolerate this. It's hard
on the peace and the furniture.

143
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:41,197
Knowing a bit about Carter, I'll let
you go without paying for the damage.

144
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,367
But go you will,
and I mean now.

145
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,310
Is there a place in town
that takes my kind?

146
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,611
You misunderstand.
I want you out of town.

147
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,846
In fact, I want you all the way
out of my jurisdiction.

148
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,955
That ain't right.

149
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:02,892
I decide what's right
in this jurisdiction. Now move.

150
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,782
Who's gonna pay for this, Sheriff?

151
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,854
Don't press your luck, Carter.

152
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,792
Now, let's talk about you chaps.

153
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,599
- We'd rather stay.
- We'll see about that.

154
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,664
I'm Sheriff John Langston.

155
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,142
As you may have guessed,
I am not from these parts.

156
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,773
You're kidding?

157
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,874
But the good citizens of Turley
have taken me in their embrace...

158
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,318
and for one simple reason:
I maintain the peace.

159
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:40,290
So, when strangers come to town,
I always ask them their business.

160
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,528
Have you come for the hanging?

161
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,087
I'm just meeting a guy here
and moving on.

162
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,360
So far I haven't been able
to find him.

163
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:52,733
In my town, if you're looking
for someone, you ask me.

164
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:56,900
All right. He's a young fella,
full of juice, about my size...

165
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,943
wears a fancy two-gun rig.

166
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,942
I know where that gentleman is.

167
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,923
I want everyone to behave himself.

168
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,160
Emmett?

169
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,964
Howdy, Jake.

170
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:24,126
I'm glad to see you!

171
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,726
Keep back.

172
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,064
- Thank you.
- What's going on here?

173
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:33,168
You got mel
This is a crazy town.

174
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,078
I think we ought to just
get out of here.

175
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,206
All I did was kiss a girl.

176
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:43,243
- That's why they got you in jail?
- Yeah, I kissed a girl.

177
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,381
This guy dibn't like it...

178
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:50,053
so we had some words
so I decided to get outta there.

179
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,825
So I did!
I got out of there.

180
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,299
You know me.
I don't want no trouble.

181
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,360
So I walked out into the street.

182
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:03,238
- He tries to shoot me in the back.
- You had to kill him?

183
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,209
No, I winged him
and he dropped his gun.

184
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,508
You're in here for winging a guy?

185
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:14,577
No, not exactly, because then
his friend opened up on me.

186
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,178
- What friend's that?
- The one with the shotgun.

187
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,314
The dead one.

188
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,097
Jake. Jake!

189
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:31,727
I'm gonna ask you once.
Was it self-defense?

190
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,201
Honest to God,
he would've killed me.

191
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,436
The jury saw it differently.

192
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,414
- He's the guy you're gonna hang?
- Tomorrow morning at 10:00.

193
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,750
I was afraid of that.

194
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,382
Emmett, can't you help me?

195
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:58,054
You know the law, Jake.
You know what they did to me.

196
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,798
Blind Pete always said you'd hang.

197
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:11,266
I guess tomorrow at dawn,
he'll be proved right.

198
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,368
10:00 a.m.

199
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,437
Right. I always thought
they dib it at dawn.

200
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:21,380
So long, kid.
I'm sorry.

201
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:35,262
I hate to see any man swing.
It's bad luck.

202
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:39,531
Bad luck for me.
I gotta bust him outta there.

203
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:48,538
You'll have to deal me out
on that.

204
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,879
I've had some experience
with that sort of thing.

205
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,114
- I don't want any more.
- I understand.

206
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:04,087
- It's not going to be easy.
- It never is.

207
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,430
But he's my brother.

208
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,469
We're going to California together...

209
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:15,939
but first we're stopping off in
Silverado, see our sister, say good-bye.

210
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,800
I can't show up there
with a story like this.

211
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,714
I guess this is where
we part ways.

212
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:30,386
- Sorry.
- No hard feelings.

213
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,514
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

214
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,156
You ain't got any money.

215
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,629
You buy me a drink.

216
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,203
You know, a good, smelly saloon...

217
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,240
is my favorite place in the world.

218
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,580
You're wearing my hat.

219
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,688
What else you got that's mine?

220
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,356
Mister, I don't know
what you're talking about.

221
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:58,741
I hope your fingers aren't tickling
my ivory-handled colt.

222
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:10,277
If you stand up slow and let me see,
you might live through this night.

223
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,292
Sure.

224
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:39,745
You're making a big mistake.

225
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,309
That's what I told 'em.

226
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:04,573
You mean you ain't coming
with Emmett and me?

227
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,974
I can't say I'm convinced
you're going anywhere.

228
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,775
We sure are!
We're leaving at dawn.

229
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,719
I have no reason to run.

230
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,952
It was a fair fight
and there were plenty of witnesses.

231
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,789
Yeah, that's what happened
with me, too.

232
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,296
The other guy drew first.

233
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,163
Right.

234
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,448
Sheriff, open up!

235
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,358
Sheriff Langston, come quickl

236
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,462
Lock the door.
Don't let anybody in.

237
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,637
Blind Pete used to do this
all by...

238
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,339
touch.

239
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,661
All right, where is he?

240
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,806
- He left.
- Like hell!

241
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,398
This is the only way out.

242
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,908
I woke up and he was gone.

243
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:57,584
All right, kid, come on out.
I know you're under there.

244
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,415
You, get over here.

245
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,060
Yeah, you, get over here.

246
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,657
Gimme your hands.

247
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,343
Did you get him?

248
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,359
Thanks for giving me a hand.

249
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,383
What now?

250
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,260
We wait.

251
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,887
Let's go.

252
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,630
Come on, Jake, let's go!

253
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,171
Get 'em at the river.

254
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,396
Here's a trick for you, kid.

255
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,047
- That them shooting?
- No, it's coming from those rocks.

256
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:28,591
- Let's go. He ain't hitting nothing.
- He's hit everything he's aimed at.

257
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,560
They won't be out of our jurisdiction
until they pass Flat Top.

258
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,994
Today my jurisdiction
ends here.

259
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,666
Pick up my hat.

260
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,901
Hey, Langston!

261
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,940
10:00!

262
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,853
This a friend of yours?

263
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,859
He is now.

264
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,360
Who is he?

265
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:08,762
- A guy who got run out of town.
- Just like us.

266
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,775
Hobart, what are you people
doing here?

267
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,511
Look.

268
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,681
Baxter and Hawley killed poor Eb
and stole the money box.

269
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,058
They went north.
We're going after 'em.

270
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,395
Forget the money.
You gotta get these people outta here.

271
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,069
This is bad country.

272
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:56,038
No place to be setting
with women and kids.

273
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,737
- The next water ain't for three days.
- We got no life without that money.

274
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,303
Everybody put in.
That's our whole stakel

275
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,212
- How long they been gone?
- About an hour.

276
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,262
I'll go with you, Mal.

277
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,140
Deal me in.

278
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,738
Jake, you know the way outta here.

279
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,981
Get this train moving to Silverado fast.
I'll go with these guys.

280
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,616
You men, stay with your wagons
and your families.

281
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,093
- Get rolling, keep your eyes peeled.
- Wait a minute.

282
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:55,622
Even if you do get the money,
how do we know you'II come back?

283
00:38:56,867 --> 00:39:00,564
If we don't,
you can keep my brother.

284
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,572
I'm trusting you, mister.

285
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,767
You trusted Baxter.

286
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,243
I don't plan on letting these men
out of my sight.

287
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:12,646
If I brought a pretty lady like that
into a place like this, I'd stay close.

288
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,912
That's none of your business.

289
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,783
Let's get going.

290
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:31,930
You got a point.
Maybe I better stay here with her.

291
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,946
Let's get turned around
and get these wagons rollingl

292
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:54,957
Everybody rides! Everybody rides!

293
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:21,012
Hanging around with you is no picnic.

294
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,957
Anybody got any ideas?

295
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:31,390
You really did it this time, Nord.

296
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,431
Thank you, boss.
Tom did his part, too.

297
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,371
Comin' in!

298
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,683
- Should I kill him, Mr. Dawson?
- In a minute.

299
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,159
I wouldn't do that. You're gonna need
every gun when that posse gets here.

300
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,423
Posse? What the hell
are you talking about?

301
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:10,160
Me and my partner robbed a bank. We
headed out with a posse on our tails.

302
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,829
My partner caught one. He kicked off
while I was looking for this canyon.

303
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:18,102
You're Dawson, ain't you? Tex LaRue.
I rode with Ry Morris. You know him.

304
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:22,407
Simms told me there's a hideout here
so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.

305
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,880
Mind?

306
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:30,410
You brought a posse to my best hideout
and you ask me if I mind?

307
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,788
Mister, I don't know
any of those names.

308
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,793
You're about to die.

309
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,319
Hold on! You don't believe me,
ask them two there.

310
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:43,525
They saw me and my pal in Turley
before we did the job.

311
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:47,901
I seen him there all right.
Don't know nothing about any bank job.

312
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,806
If you took the bank in Turley,
where's the money?

313
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,413
I'd get down if I were you.
They might be up there right now.

314
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,477
- No money, huh?
- It's in my saddlebags.

315
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,488
I ain't getting out in the open
to get it.

316
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,543
Stop your firin'...

317
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,212
until you see something.

318
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:42,186
If we charge them, they won't stand
a chance. We gotta get to the horses!

319
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,160
- Horses? What're you talking about?
- Cover mel

320
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,741
Brave man.

321
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:10,219
I think there's only a couple of guys
up there and this asshole's one of 'em.

322
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:24,401
Get that guy!
Keep him from getting the horses!

323
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,983
That was some idea of yours.
Next time you go in.

324
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:24,617
I knew itl
Put that box on my horse.

325
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,768
Mister, you got a lot to learn
about people.

326
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:08,031
They got a place south of Silverado.
Guess they've done okay.

327
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,869
Good enough, anyway,
so when my mama wrote me last time...

328
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:14,843
she said they needed my help
to work the place.

329
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,040
That was almost nine months ago
she wrote.

330
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:22,279
Letter took a while to find me, but
when it did it was just the right time.

331
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,020
Where were you?

332
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:30,525
Chicago. Working
in the slaughterhouses.

333
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:33,461
Chicago?
You've been to Chicago?

334
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,925
Was it wonderful?

335
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,737
Hey, Paden...

336
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,742
where you been?

337
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,608
I was just...

338
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,614
checking the...

339
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,550
You know, looking in.

340
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:04,088
Geez, Paden, her old man
ain't even cold yet.

341
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,012
Looks pretty shallow here.
We could just go off.

342
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:39,428
Pull 'em up. Yeah.

343
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,206
That's all right
Let 'em go.

344
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,141
The bank is soft on the other side.

345
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,256
Let's go.

346
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,554
Well, this is it, gents.

347
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:42,388
My mama told me
to head through that notch.

348
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,290
Good luck, Mal.

349
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,852
Maybe we'll see you around sometime.

350
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,420
Yeah, maybe.

351
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:50,989
So long.

352
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,741
- So long, Mal!
- Bye.

353
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:21,192
- Hope to see you again, ma'am.
- I'll ride along with the lady.

354
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:27,166
Take a look at this farmland
before I come into Silverado.

355
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,434
See what makes a trip this hard
worth taking.

356
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,510
I'll see you around.

357
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,513
I'll be around.
Jake, let's gol

358
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,459
See you in Silverado, Paden!

359
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,795
I'll be there.

360
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:02,390
Mr. And Mrs. Parker have agreed
to join their parcel to mine.

361
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,060
We'll work them together.

362
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,535
Mine starts right over there.

363
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,866
It's all I've ever wanted.

364
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,270
Pretty land, isn't it?

365
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,369
And a pretty lady.

366
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,375
A lot of men have told me that.

367
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:24,249
Maybe it's true.

368
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:27,848
I guess some women are slow
to believe it.

369
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:29,789
Believe it.

370
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:34,728
They're drawn to me by that,
but it never lasts.

371
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,493
Why?

372
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,763
Because they don't like
what I want.

373
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,804
What's that?

374
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,067
I want to build something.

375
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,075
Make things grow.

376
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:50,443
That takes hard work.
A lifetime of it.

377
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:54,109
That's not why a man comes
to a pretty woman.

378
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:00,114
After a while,
I won't be so pretty...

379
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,658
but this land will be.

380
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,162
Come here.

381
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:25,306
- Hi, J.T.
- Jake, how are you?

382
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,350
Come on, son.

383
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,179
You remember us?

384
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,780
Yeah.

385
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,989
Hi, Augie.

386
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,870
It's good to be home, Kate.

387
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,235
Daddy?

388
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,644
I saw the light.

389
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:37,483
I thought maybe Rae
had come back to see me.

390
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:41,888
I never thought it'd be my boy.
I never thought that!

391
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,918
Mama?

392
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,828
She was sick a long time.

393
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,530
She was sick when she wrote you.

394
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,093
But she didn't say it.

395
00:52:55,172 --> 00:53:00,371
I never thought you'd come back,
but she did.

396
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:05,176
- Where's Rae?
- She's gone. Gone to town.

397
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,581
She hated working the farm...

398
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,813
just like you.

399
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,616
What happened?

400
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,680
They run me off.

401
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:17,556
They burned me out!

402
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:20,528
Made it so I couldn't do...

403
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,157
just like Georgia!

404
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,168
You own this land.

405
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:30,297
I paid the government for it.
That don't mean much out here.

406
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:35,902
Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat
in a cave in them hills.

407
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,141
Hidin' out.

408
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:43,243
- Afraid to walk my own land.
- What about the law?

409
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,984
Whose law? The law here runs a man down
just like these cattle.

410
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,019
That ain't right.

411
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,759
I had enough of what ain't right.

412
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,960
What we got here is a bad situation.

413
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,766
Those homesteaders you brought in
are gonna make it worse.

414
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:06,536
When they come to stake their claims,
it's gonna be the start of big trouble.

415
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,635
Gonna cut McKendrick off
in the north.

416
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:14,014
A man could die of thirst before anybody
offered him a drink around here.

417
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:20,654
Maybe you oughta come to California
with Jake and me.

418
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,726
Augie's gonna grow up here.

419
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,889
There's nothing wrong with the land.
It's just some of the people.

420
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:32,492
The problem is, Emmett,
you killed the wrong McKendrick.

421
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:37,733
Watch what you're saying around Augie.
Emmett didn't kill anybody.

422
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,702
Well, it was self-defense
sure enough.

423
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,975
But I do think you'd have to say
I killed old Murdo.

424
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:47,380
I think that's definitely the word.

425
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:52,717
The son is worse than the old man. He's
smoother so you don't hear him coming.

426
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,848
He'll do anything
to keep his range free.

427
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:59,918
I'm worried what he's gonna do
when he finds out you boys are back.

428
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:03,124
I think Jake here
can take care of himself.

429
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,066
I just did five years
I didn't owe.

430
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:10,266
McKendrick oughta be satisfied with that
and let it lie.

431
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,576
What brings you out of your hole,
Johnson?

432
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,206
Who's that with you, Ezra?

433
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:25,277
This is my son.
He's come home.

434
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:29,655
Ain't that sweet, Red?

435
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:35,755
- You're trespassing on McKendrick land.
- You got it all wrong, mister.

436
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,630
- This is our place.
- What?

437
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,466
Mr. McKendrick bought this place
from your father.

438
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,870
That's a liel

439
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:47,501
Tomorrow we're going to town and
straighten that out once and for all.

440
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:50,705
The next day we'll be back here
farming.

441
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,305
And them cattle better be gone.

442
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:58,548
If I find any cattle
on our land after tomorrow...

443
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:01,181
I'm gonna start carving 'em
into steaks.

444
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:04,283
And believe me,
that's one thing I know about.

445
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:09,025
Killing cattle is a hanging offense
in these parts.

446
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:13,399
If we shot you down right now,
we'd be within our rights.

447
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,600
You ever seen what a Henry rifle can do
in the hands of an expert?

448
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:21,075
Who would that be? You?

449
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:30,017
This ain't the end of it.

450
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,606
What can I do you for, stranger?

451
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,252
- You work here?
- I run the place.

452
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,084
- What can I get you?
- Bourbon.

453
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:41,714
Right.

454
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,995
Nifty.

455
00:57:56,072 --> 00:58:01,203
The world is what you make of it.
If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.

456
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:05,008
I'll drink to that.
Will you join me, Miss...

457
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,106
Stella.

458
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:09,208
Paden.

459
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,457
Stella.

460
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:19,256
Are you the Midnight Star herself?

461
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:25,098
I am. I'm always there,
but I only shine at night.

462
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,868
Compliments to you, Miss Stella.

463
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,503
This is what I call a saloon.

464
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:39,343
Thanks. That's what I call it, too.

465
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:42,942
- And I know what I'm talking about.
- You like a good saloon?

466
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,180
It's the only place I'm happy.

467
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:49,487
Me, too!
What's wrong with us?

468
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:55,655
You wouldn't be needing any help
around here, say, with the gambling?

469
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,867
See that fellow playing with his hair?
That's Kelly, my so-called partner.

470
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:05,635
- He runs that side.
- So-called?

471
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:09,041
Yeah. Apart from being
a loudmouthed, lying cheat...

472
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,546
he's just the man
I would've picked.

473
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:14,583
- Why'd you go into business with him?
- I don't own this place.

474
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,950
The man who does,
stuck me with Kelly.

475
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:21,787
- Who's the owner?
- Here he comes right now.

476
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,135
Well, look at this.

477
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:41,938
Two of my favorite people
in the world talking to each other.

478
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:49,817
Stella, this is one of my oldest
surviving friends.

479
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:53,515
- Treat him right.
- That was my plan.

480
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,526
You two are gonna get along just fine.
You got a lot in common. Kellyl

481
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,824
Get over here.

482
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:03,627
You didn't come all this way just
to pay me back that money, did you?

483
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,531
- Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
- Howdy.

484
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:12,098
Give the man a line of credit.
He already owes the house 13 bucks.

485
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:19,772
- You got a place to stay?
- I just got into town.

486
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:24,843
- We still got that extra room out back?
- It's not in use at the moment.

487
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,952
What brings you to my saloon?

488
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:32,961
Luck, I guess.

489
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,759
Good olb Paden.

490
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:40,064
I was hoping maybe you'd changed
your mind about the job.

491
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:43,470
You didn't tell me
you owned a saloon.

492
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:49,178
That ain't the half of it, friend.

493
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,237
Welcome to heaven.

494
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:31,180
Where's the other one, Johnson?

495
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:34,746
Our orders are to run you two
out of here.

496
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,262
You couldn't leave well enough alone,
could you, old man?

497
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:48,998
You tell us where your son is.
There don't have to be any shooting.

498
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:53,133
You're lying, Hoyt,
like always!

499
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,973
Not this time.
I got my orders.

500
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,275
My son's on the way to town.

501
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,416
That's too bad.

502
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,119
You're just gonna have to go
by yourself.

503
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,331
Daddy?

504
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,260
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman.

505
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:31,534
- But she's got a hard idea for living.
- Yeah?

506
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,570
All I'm saying is you won't trip over me
if you look her up.

507
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,274
I'm going to California
with my brother.

508
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:44,945
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett.
He's a friend of mine.

509
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:48,388
- This is Sheriff Cobb.
- Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

510
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:52,257
The pleasure's mine. Always happy
to meet a friend of Paden's.

511
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,762
Stella, bring Kelly out here,
will you?

512
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,324
Aren't you Kate Hollis' brother?

513
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:00,835
That's right.

514
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:05,829
You're the one who killed
old Murdo McKendrick.

515
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,141
I didn't have much choice. He was about
to shoot my brother in the back.

516
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:16,146
Can't be having that now, can we?

517
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:20,679
Wanna see me?

518
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:25,284
Kelly, we're gonna make
an adjustment.

519
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,626
I wanted you to be here
when I offered Paden your job.

520
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,826
I think he could do it
without getting greedy.

521
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:37,429
Stella and I are tired of you
skimming our profits.

522
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:42,068
- What are you talking about?
- I'm done talking. Get out.

523
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:45,272
- You can't do this.
- Really?

524
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,665
Want the job?

525
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,735
I see you're an understanding boss.

526
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,201
Nothing like that
would ever happen between us.

527
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,973
Maybe we oughta ask Stella?

528
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,717
You'd be welcome.

529
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:24,548
No, Kelly, he'll kill you!

530
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:34,757
Thanks for warning me.

531
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:49,103
Didn't have much choice.

532
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,224
All right, stand back.

533
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:17,296
I never enjoy killing a man.

534
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:35,452
Excuse me. Sheriff, I'm a gambler
who'd like to run an honest game here.

535
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:39,790
To whom do I speak about that?
I hope it's not this gentleman.

536
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,361
That's him.

537
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:54,139
I better find somebody
to clean up this mess.

538
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:01,879
You used to ride with that guy?

539
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,862
What are you doing?

540
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:19,367
I told you to practice on a horse
that's not moving, huh?

541
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:27,908
Where are you going?

542
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:31,140
I got things to do, kid.
I'm a busy man.

543
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,477
I'll go with you.

544
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:38,452
A grown man can't have a little boy
with him everywhere he goes.

545
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,819
Who's a grown man?

546
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,497
Hello, Rae.

547
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:03,540
What are you doing here?
I thought you were done with our family.

548
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,637
Daddy's dead.

549
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:12,780
He was murdered.

550
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,413
Who did it?

551
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:18,586
I'm not sure, but I've got an idea.
When I'm sure, they gonna pay.

552
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,754
That's just fine.

553
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:25,232
Where were you when Mama and Daddy
needed you? It's too late, Mal.

554
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:30,204
Now you finally show up, and all you
can think is to get yourself killed.

555
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:39,145
- You okay, Rae?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

556
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:42,710
Introduce me to your friend.

557
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:46,619
He's not my friend.
He used to be my brother.

558
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:53,217
Calvin Stanhope.
But my mother called me "Slick."

559
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,695
Excuse me.

560
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,904
- Why are you here? This ain't for you.
- That's none of your business.

561
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:13,438
Rae, all we got is each other.

562
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,552
I don't have any family anymore.

563
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:48,242
I'm surprised to see you
out here today.

564
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,588
Just come out to say good-bye.

565
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,386
Good-bye?

566
01:09:56,458 --> 01:10:01,191
Yeah. Jake and me will be heading out
for California soon.

567
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:06,727
You came all the way out here just
to tell me you're going to California?

568
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:10,431
All you had to do was go.
We'd never see each other again.

569
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:14,101
- That's why I'm here.
- Why?

570
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:17,976
You don't make it easy on a fella.

571
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:24,478
Maybe you thought
you'd be back this way someday.

572
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,689
Yeah.

573
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,126
That must've been it.

574
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:43,663
It's McKendrick's men!

575
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:34,954
Move!

576
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,237
All right, let's go!

577
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:05,953
Goddamn it! We won't quit!
You bastards!

578
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,330
Is that a fair mix?

579
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:20,926
I'm saving lives here. Straight stuff
would raise a blister on boot leather.

580
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:24,531
I meant it seemed like
a lot of whiskey.

581
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:30,537
- What's this?
- That's the good stuff.

582
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:32,842
Yeah? How good?

583
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:50,130
- Here's to the good stuff.
- May it last a long time.

584
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,369
You better get out here.

585
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:02,105
- Nothing happened. This is my job.
- Shut up.

586
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:06,443
I don't believe a lady has to explain
anything to a man this ugly.

587
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:13,518
What's the trouble here?

588
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:15,523
Stay out of this, Paden.

589
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:18,788
He can't do that.
Cobb's hired him.

590
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:21,295
That's Cobb's mistake.

591
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:23,661
Come out of there, Phoebe.
You've done enough.

592
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:34,208
Go home.

593
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:37,544
All I did was kiss the girl.

594
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:42,215
That's what you said in Turley.
Remember how that ended?

595
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:47,248
What's the matter? You afraid
I couldn't get those two behind me?

596
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,191
I don't want you gettin' anybody
in my place.

597
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,466
Boom.

598
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,771
I should've killed you
a long time ago.

599
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:12,847
Why not now?

600
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:24,557
Don't do it, Tyree.

601
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:28,585
I just lost a partner. If you kill him,
I'll never get anyone to work in here.

602
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:31,957
You better start lookin'.

603
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,057
You really are a gambler, aren't you?

604
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,772
Give me some of the good stuff.

605
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,618
Whoa! Hold it.
Sorry about that.

606
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:33,826
- Where'd you get this horse?
- This is my uncle's horse.

607
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:37,457
- Like hell it is.
- What's the problem, Swann?

608
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,161
Yeah.
What's the problem?

609
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,309
Emmett.

610
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:51,378
McKendrick.

611
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,314
I didn't know you were out.

612
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,450
Seem short to you?

613
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:09,058
That's all over with as far
as I'm concerned. I'm satisfied.

614
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,224
Sounds good.

615
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,827
All right, then.
Let's go.

616
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:19,169
- Don't you recognize this pinto?
- What?

617
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,971
- That's Lee's horse.
- Shut up, Swann.

618
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:25,642
Wait a minute.

619
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,876
Get down from there, Augie.

620
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:59,404
The man who lost this horse
must've been working for you.

621
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:02,407
I should've known.

622
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,682
You changed your brand, Ethan.

623
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:09,850
A lot of things changed
when my father died.

624
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,989
- He must be pretty good.
- He's good, all right.

625
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,358
Too good for my men.

626
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,897
That's why you've
gotta take care of it.

627
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,999
- What about his brother?
- We'II handle that.

628
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,129
He's careless.

629
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,998
Things are gettin' messy around here.

630
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,546
I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.

631
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:07,548
I heard that, too.

632
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,945
Did you hear his son
is still around?

633
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:18,281
Cobb, looks like you're finally
gonna earn your money.

634
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:27,295
From what I've seen,
Paden doesn't care about money.

635
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,394
He says he doesn't care about anything,
but he does.

636
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:31,803
There's just no tellin'
what it's gonna be.

637
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,807
Howdy, Mr. Slick.

638
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,776
Let me tell you
about your friend Paden.

639
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:39,643
Me, him, Tyree and a few others...

640
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,275
did a good bit of riding together
a few years back.

641
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:46,377
Business was pretty good.

642
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:50,824
We were movin' around a lot the way you
have to in that line of work.

643
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,986
Somewhere along the line
we picked up this dog.

644
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:58,021
One of the boys took to feedin' it,
so it followed us everywhere.

645
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,228
One time we were leaving
a little Missouri town...

646
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:04,795
with a bunch of locals
hot on our tail.

647
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:08,741
This dog got tangled up
with Tyree's horse.

648
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,835
Tyree went flyin'.

649
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:16,781
Tyree was mad, and being Tyree...

650
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:18,877
he shot the dog.

651
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,013
He didn't kill him, though.

652
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:24,149
Before you know it,
Paden is off his horse...

653
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:26,353
and he's holding this dog.

654
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,659
He got strange,
said we should go on without him.

655
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:32,700
I thought he was kidding,
but he wasn't.

656
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,534
Tyree was ready to plug 'em both.
All this with a posse after us.

657
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,606
I thought we were pals
after all the ridin' we'd done together.

658
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:45,737
All of a sudden he's worried
about some mutt.

659
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:49,645
We did like he asked
and we left him.

660
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:53,279
He went to jail for a dog.

661
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:57,554
You want to hear the funny part?

662
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,220
Paden didn't even like that damn dog.

663
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:04,297
It evened out in the end.

664
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,300
They locked me up.

665
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:08,495
The dog sprung me.

666
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,238
Where's the dog now?

667
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,575
He left me.

668
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:19,045
Come on, Paden.
I'll buy you a drink.

669
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,158
I took out $13.

670
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:38,932
This is a lot of money.

671
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,662
I told you this was a sweet setup.

672
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:43,795
It is that.

673
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:47,200
Maybe you could run it without Stella.

674
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:52,077
This is her life.

675
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,615
I'll go before she does.

676
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,243
Easy, boy.
It's just an idea.

677
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,287
Thanks but forget it.

678
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:06,551
Paden, what makes all this work...

679
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:08,596
is me doing my job.

680
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:13,326
Those fellows you come to town with
are causing some trouble.

681
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,767
It's gonna take
some straightening out.

682
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:18,831
I have my responsibilities.

683
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:22,365
I want you to understand
it has nothing to do with us.

684
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:25,508
What is it you want from me?

685
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,013
Nothin'.

686
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:29,249
Do nothin'.

687
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:31,844
Don't get between us.

688
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:37,857
I'm a great believer in doing nothin'.

689
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,526
We understand each other.

690
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:45,763
Don't worry about me.

691
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:50,294
If you're taking on Emmett, the last
place I want to be is between you.

692
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:41,855
You're empty.

693
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:34,908
Ain't you dead yet?

694
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:37,467
Cobb said he'd be hard to kill.

695
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:40,673
I guess you couldn't hear us comin'.

696
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:44,182
He was practicing so hard
for a fight...

697
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:47,244
he missed the whole thing.

698
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:48,949
So long, stranger.

699
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:56,955
I don't wanna kill you
and you don't wanna be dead.

700
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,334
He can't be that good.

701
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,128
You wanna find out?

702
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:08,102
I think we should do like he says.

703
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,898
How you feeling?

704
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,597
I'd be a lot worse
if you hadn't come along.

705
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:37,638
I didn't just come along.
I was lookin' for you.

706
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:40,833
Jake said you were out there.

707
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:45,073
He told me about that business
the other day.

708
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:49,139
He said you boys took
a Henry rifle...

709
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,344
off one of McKendrick's men.

710
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,517
- I wanted to see it.
- That's it.

711
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:07,562
This was my father's.
The man who killed him took it.

712
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:10,737
I'm sorry.

713
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:18,303
I gotta get to my brother. They come
after me, they'll want him, too.

714
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:20,472
- You'll never make it.
- I've got to.

715
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:25,852
I'II go.

716
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,552
I'll bring Jake here.

717
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:44,499
You be careful.

718
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,870
You're in it now.

719
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:49,466
It's gonna get mean.

720
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,621
Augie, I've had enough of this.

721
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:10,255
Kiss your father
and get in bed.

722
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:25,936
Get out.
We have nothing to talk about.

723
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:29,040
- I need help.
- Why come to me?

724
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:32,575
Because you're my sister.
There's nobody else.

725
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:41,788
The men who killed Daddy are after Jake.
I've gotta talk to him.

726
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:45,321
- What's stoppin' you?
- They're watching. I can't get through.

727
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,301
What makes you think I could?

728
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:50,496
Why would they stop you?

729
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:55,606
'Cause I'm your sister.

730
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:59,112
He ain't in the saloon, either.

731
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:05,375
Where is that boy?

732
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:09,222
You're crazy!

733
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:27,602
- Why him?
- You need help, don't you?

734
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,975
Jake said he'd meet you
behind the church.

735
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:40,350
Be careful.
They're all over the place.

736
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:42,922
Thanks.

737
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,558
Good luck.

738
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:05,936
You must be Ezra Johnson's boy.

739
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:09,315
Now don't shoot the sheriff.

740
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:12,419
That's against the law.

741
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:19,084
So is killing a deputy.

742
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:28,128
We're gonna give you a fair trial...

743
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:32,706
followed by a first-class hangin'.

744
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:37,068
Or you could ride out of here
before bawn.

745
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:42,073
You just have to tell me where
I can find your friend Emmett.

746
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,600
Why are they doing this?

747
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:03,563
Because they enjoy it.

748
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:08,567
- What happened to Emmett?
- Cobb's men almost killed him.

749
01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:10,804
That's what happened.

750
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:13,108
I got there just short of too late.

751
01:29:15,149 --> 01:29:16,582
Lucky.

752
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,619
Yeah.

753
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:23,018
It's working out real good.

754
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:26,459
Where's Emmett now?

755
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:30,193
You're working for Cobb these days,
aren't you?

756
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:37,062
Your friends have been beating me
to find that out.

757
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:39,629
You think I'm just gonna tell you?

758
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:44,170
You waltzed in here easy.

759
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:46,611
You can go out the same way.

760
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:50,983
Me they figure to carry out.

761
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:15,834
Is he all right?

762
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,572
Looks bad, Rae.

763
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:20,773
He's a hard man.

764
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:23,180
He won't give them what they want.

765
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,446
It's gonna cost him.

766
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,249
Can't you stop 'em?

767
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,258
I don't think so.

768
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:39,489
What is it?

769
01:30:54,315 --> 01:30:57,682
Oh, Kate.

770
01:30:57,752 --> 01:30:59,185
Sweet Kate.

771
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:22,707
Don't.

772
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:28,880
Jake's been with me all evening.
I just left him.

773
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,418
- Where is he now?
- Went home.

774
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:39,751
Been with you all evening?
Even after Slick came to get him?

775
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:41,795
Slick didn't come.

776
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:49,989
Stop it!

777
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,998
He saw us.

778
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:53,499
Bring him.

779
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:34,740
Fire!

780
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:37,539
The land office is on fire!

781
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:53,426
Help J.T.

782
01:33:53,494 --> 01:33:55,894
Where's Augie?
Her boy must be upstairs.

783
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:59,922
No. No.
They took him.

784
01:34:00,001 --> 01:34:02,526
They took my Augie.

785
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:15,481
You go around the back of the house.

786
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:18,416
Wyoming, you go over there
and help out.

787
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:25,423
Tom, you help with the buckets, too.

788
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,757
Nathan, help with that wagon.

789
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:11,337
Give it up.

790
01:35:15,476 --> 01:35:19,139
I hate to see this kind of thing
in my town.

791
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:21,738
Gonna have to look into this.

792
01:35:21,816 --> 01:35:23,477
Maybe I will, too.

793
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:26,982
I thought we talked about that.

794
01:35:28,422 --> 01:35:30,890
We didn't talk about this.

795
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:34,693
They took the little boy, Cobb.

796
01:35:57,218 --> 01:36:00,016
You're still worried about the dog,
aren't you?

797
01:36:01,989 --> 01:36:05,015
You've gotta calm down. Everything
will be put straight in a few days.

798
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:10,427
Yeah. I saw how you put
Mal Johnson straight.

799
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:19,831
Never could count on you
to be reasonable.

800
01:36:21,175 --> 01:36:24,110
Don't force me to make an adjustment
around here.

801
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:30,848
Cobb, you got nothing I need.

802
01:36:33,587 --> 01:36:35,885
I'm not thinking
about your future, Paden.

803
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:39,292
I'm worried about Stella.

804
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:47,632
What's she got to do with this?

805
01:36:49,069 --> 01:36:51,003
Not a thing.

806
01:36:52,273 --> 01:36:54,400
She's just a mutual friend.

807
01:36:56,577 --> 01:37:00,377
But if you wind up
on the wrong side of this...

808
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:02,381
she's gonna get hurt.

809
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:09,455
I'm trying to save you from yourself.

810
01:37:10,424 --> 01:37:12,415
Don't change your luck.

811
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:49,151
- What is it that I can't figure?
- What do you mean?

812
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:55,358
Cobb's got something on you
and it must be pretty good.

813
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:57,461
What makes you say that?

814
01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:00,837
If he didn't, you'd never sit still
with all this going on.

815
01:38:00,908 --> 01:38:03,103
You sure?

816
01:38:03,177 --> 01:38:05,304
Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.

817
01:38:08,015 --> 01:38:09,607
What's he got?

818
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:22,125
Cobb says there's no tellin'
what you're gonna care about.

819
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:25,799
Is that what he said?

820
01:38:28,168 --> 01:38:30,966
He figured it okay this time.

821
01:38:59,967 --> 01:39:03,994
Look who's here, Johnson.
Your sweet little sister.

822
01:39:04,071 --> 01:39:08,770
Maybe I better search her.
It won't be easy.

823
01:39:09,677 --> 01:39:12,305
I've only got one good hand.

824
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:51,914
Garth, you in there?

825
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,670
To my Midnight Star.

826
01:40:17,044 --> 01:40:19,945
Cobb's using me to stop you.

827
01:40:21,448 --> 01:40:25,851
Good people are being hurt
because of me.

828
01:40:25,919 --> 01:40:28,046
That makes me mad.

829
01:40:30,724 --> 01:40:34,660
Some people think
because they're stronger or meaner...

830
01:40:34,728 --> 01:40:37,094
they can push you around.

831
01:40:37,164 --> 01:40:39,462
I've seen a lot of that.

832
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:44,269
But it's only true
if you let it be.

833
01:40:44,338 --> 01:40:47,068
The world's what you make of it.

834
01:40:48,242 --> 01:40:52,372
I like your attitude,
but it can be risky.

835
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:57,007
I'm ready for that.

836
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:59,018
What about you?

837
01:41:01,422 --> 01:41:03,481
I don't want you to get hurt.

838
01:41:06,693 --> 01:41:11,062
He can't hurt me
if he's dead.

839
01:41:22,176 --> 01:41:24,269
Stella, come quick.

840
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:35,214
She sprung her brother all by herself
and this is what happened.

841
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:38,690
- He brought her here.
- Where'd he go?

842
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:43,458
I told him about Jake and the
little boy. He went off after Emmett.

843
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:47,330
Stop crying. Get Doc Skinner
and bring him to the shed.

844
01:41:50,904 --> 01:41:53,805
Pick her up.
I've got a place to hide her.

845
01:41:56,343 --> 01:41:59,904
You better get in there with her
until this thing is over.

846
01:42:25,038 --> 01:42:26,972
Where's Jake?

847
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,407
- McKendrick's men got him.
- Is he alive?

848
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:36,116
It's worse than that.

849
01:42:36,183 --> 01:42:38,413
They took him at your sister's house.

850
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:40,976
Her husband was shot. I don't know
if he's gonna make it.

851
01:42:42,055 --> 01:42:44,285
- Kate?
- She was hurt.

852
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,426
Pretty bad.

853
01:42:51,732 --> 01:42:53,962
They took the little boy with them.

854
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:49,651
Put on one of these.

855
01:43:51,325 --> 01:43:53,259
This ought to do.

856
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:33,462
Garth?

857
01:44:33,533 --> 01:44:34,966
Fox!

858
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:45,836
Get Kyle and Dusty over here.
And keep your eyes open.

859
01:44:45,912 --> 01:44:48,437
We're running out of deputies.

860
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:07,083
Stampede!

861
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:11,143
Turn 'em aroundl

862
01:49:03,603 --> 01:49:05,036
Go!

863
01:49:47,447 --> 01:49:49,472
Augie, where's Jake?

864
01:49:49,549 --> 01:49:51,016
He's dead.

865
01:49:51,084 --> 01:49:52,517
What?

866
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:56,412
He was trying to get away...

867
01:49:56,489 --> 01:49:59,754
and he fell off his horse,
off a cliff.

868
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:03,957
Jake fell off his horse?

869
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:09,291
It's all right.

870
01:51:23,176 --> 01:51:25,838
Yeah! Where's Emmett?

871
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:27,345
Inside.

872
01:51:29,749 --> 01:51:32,775
- Where have you been?
- Playing dead.

873
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:38,513
- Let's get out of here.
- Right.

874
01:52:28,441 --> 01:52:30,773
- Jakel
- Uncle Jake!

875
01:52:32,378 --> 01:52:33,811
Hi, guys.

876
01:52:38,384 --> 01:52:40,318
Come on, Augie.

877
01:52:42,288 --> 01:52:44,882
Come on, Augie, jump.

878
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:46,391
Come on I

879
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:53,529
He's on the roof, Paden.

880
01:53:46,586 --> 01:53:49,214
It never should've got this far, Cobb.

881
01:53:49,289 --> 01:53:51,382
This is as far as it's goin'.

882
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:53,687
I'll do my part...

883
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,194
but you better watch your ass.

884
01:53:56,262 --> 01:53:58,628
These guys will shoot it off.

885
01:54:12,579 --> 01:54:14,945
I'm gonna enjoy this.

886
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:19,918
It used to be a peaceful town.

887
01:54:23,656 --> 01:54:26,090
What's goin' on, Sheriff?

888
01:54:27,694 --> 01:54:30,094
Hide anb watch.

889
01:54:39,405 --> 01:54:42,806
Everybody off the streets.
There's gonna be trouble.

890
01:54:59,092 --> 01:55:02,528
- Any sign of Stella?
- Been looking.

891
01:55:02,595 --> 01:55:06,122
- See if you can find Rae.
- Yeah.

892
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:40,020
You wait till we get back.
Don't come in.

893
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:51,209
See you around.

894
01:55:52,312 --> 01:55:54,678
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.

895
01:55:56,182 --> 01:55:57,615
You're on.

896
01:55:58,952 --> 01:56:00,783
Let's get 'eml

897
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:05,481
Hey, Paden.

898
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,693
Good luck.

899
01:56:34,587 --> 01:56:37,249
I'm going for the doctor.

900
01:56:37,323 --> 01:56:39,791
You're going to be all right.

901
01:57:31,744 --> 01:57:34,178
Don't be afraid, baby.

902
01:57:34,247 --> 01:57:38,343
I'll stay with you
until your little friend comes back.

903
01:57:45,925 --> 01:57:49,224
Come on out, boys!
Jake's in town! Let's start the ball!

904
02:00:12,705 --> 02:00:14,138
Mal.

905
02:00:16,209 --> 02:00:19,610
I'm glad you're here. I've been watching
her, but she needs a doctor.

906
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:25,683
Yeah.

907
02:00:54,213 --> 02:00:56,374
Looking for this?

908
02:01:09,662 --> 02:01:12,187
It's all right.
I'm here now.

909
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:29,110
What a waste.

910
02:05:30,823 --> 02:05:33,690
This could've been such a sweet deal
for us.

911
02:05:35,427 --> 02:05:37,725
Yeah.

912
02:05:37,796 --> 02:05:39,354
Bad luck.

913
02:05:47,973 --> 02:05:49,531
Good-bye, Cobb.

914
02:05:51,544 --> 02:05:53,444
Good-bye, Paden.

915
02:06:48,167 --> 02:06:49,600
To California.

916
02:06:58,877 --> 02:07:01,437
- Got to go.
- Right.

917
02:07:11,857 --> 02:07:14,291
You take care of yourself,
you hear?

918
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:16,627
You, too.

919
02:07:21,934 --> 02:07:24,095
Jake, Paden.

920
02:07:27,373 --> 02:07:29,307
Come on, Molly.

921
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:51,160
Weren't you gonna come out
and say good-bye?

922
02:07:51,230 --> 02:07:53,892
I already did that.

923
02:07:53,966 --> 02:07:56,196
You know where I'll be.

924
02:07:57,136 --> 02:07:58,569
Yeah.

925
02:08:17,556 --> 02:08:18,989
So long, Paden.

926
02:08:19,058 --> 02:08:21,754
So long, Jake.

927
02:08:27,466 --> 02:08:29,866
You might make a farmer yet.

928
02:08:30,536 --> 02:08:33,505
I got a job.

929
02:08:43,348 --> 02:08:45,373
Let's get goin'.

930
02:08:56,462 --> 02:08:58,760
Take care of your folks.

931
02:08:58,831 --> 02:09:00,264
I will.

932
02:09:08,073 --> 02:09:10,041
We'll be backl
