00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,000
Stand back.
Shocking at 360.

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,530
- Clear!
- You're killing him!

Previously,
on <i>Chicago Fire...</i>

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,400
My mom is up for parole,

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,000
and I'm trying
to help her get out.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,170
I just didn't want you to think
I was blowing you off.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,210
You don't have to worry.

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,340
I'm not gonna tell
anybody at work.

9
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,750
This is our thing.
Nobody else's.

10
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,780
You don't get to come back,

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,450
married and pregnant,
saying that you miss me.

12
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,120
You walked away.

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,420
- Did you start that fire?
- I didn't do anything wrong.

14
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,390
Who the hell are you?

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,260
What are you doing
with Ernie?

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,600
I said, what are you
doing with that kid?

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,430
I've never seen anyone
return to full duty

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,400
- after this surgery.
- Rene, she's transferring

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,400
to Madrid for her job
and found a great rehab unit.

20
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,170
- How long you staying?
- I'm moving there.

00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,550
Oh. [laughs]

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,550
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no.

24
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,820
- Come on.
- No!

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,290
Wow.

26
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,360
Do you mind
taking our picture?

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,760
Sure.

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,130
[laughs]

29
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,430
Apartment fire.
Ten-car pile up.

30
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,140
- Hand caught in a machine.
- Okay, all right.

31
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,540
In Madrid,
it is going to be,

32
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,340
um, tapas, tapas,
dance club,

33
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,610
and, um,
Catholic church.

34
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,350
You think I can dance?

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,420
Well, I can dance
and you can just watch.

36
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,680
That, I can do.

37
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,320
- I've never done that before.
- Oh, yeah?

38
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
- Yeah.
- Wow.

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,820
Well, then I guess
this is gonna be the first

40
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,490
- of many new things then, huh?
- Yeah.

41
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,390
Yeah.

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,730
What is it?

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,170
I met this doctor.

44
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,640
- A doctor?
- Not like that.

45
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,440
I just, um...

46
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,340
Well, I put out
some feelers

47
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,510
to my medical contacts
and, um,

48
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,420
it turns out that
the Chief of orthopedics

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,150
over at River Forest Hospital

50
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,390
is pioneering some kind of
experimental spinal surgery,

51
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,460
and he wants to meet you.

52
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,260
- Really?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,630
You know what?
Maybe this will help you

54
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,630
get to Madrid even sooner.

55

Chief Boden.

57
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,740
Do you remember me?

58
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,380
- Ernie.
- Yeah.

59
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,620
What's going on?

60
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,780
You okay?

61
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,520
No.

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,160
[sighs]

63
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,320
Talk to me.

64
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,760
Where are you?

65
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,500
Ernie.

66
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,900
Ernie.

Not good.

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,490
Cruz, Mills,
vent the roof.

72
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,360
Hardware store's got

- Not breathing.

Fire's out, Chief.

another dumpster fire.

Sync and corrected by Gianluca Belfiglio

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,690
- What's up?
- Door's jammed.

87
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,860
I told Chief we needed
to grease this puppy

88
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,400
- before the weather turned.
- And what, he ignored you?

89
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,000
No, he told me to do it,
but I forgot.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,770
I've been preoccupied.

91
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,770
Weren't you and Cindy
using protection?

92

We've got
four kids, Mouch.

I was counting on my sperm
being too tired

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,580
to make the swim.

95
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,340
Well, I'm gonna
head inside

96
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,810
and check the levels
on the hot chocolate.

97
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,880
Yeah, I'm gonna
provide back-up.

98
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,060
You know, my grandmother
had this garage door

99
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,820
that was always stuck
2 feet off the ground.

100
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,630
So one time I tell
my brother nick,

101
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,790
I say, "Go inside
and grab some butter."

102
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,300
- What?
- We got a rule.

103
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,030
You tell a story
that we've all heard

104

a million times,
we raise our hand,

105
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,600
you gotta shut up,
no questions asked.

106
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
That's actually impolite
and insulting.

107
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,640
Like that's on us. [laughs]

108
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,870
I haven't heard the story.

109
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,610

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,810
Where are you guys going?

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,640
Oh, I asked Cruz
to give me driving lessons.

I'm actually next in line
to drive 81.

if anyone wants it.

Don't even think about it.

118
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,730
Had a dog over at 80
when I was there.

119
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,400
Still have the teeth marks
in my ankle to prove it.

120
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,530
My dad says he's gonna
throw it in the river

121
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,800
if I don't get rid of it.

122
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,370
I'll take it, or at least I can find
 a home for it or something.

Well, there's that.

126
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,480
Does he have a name?

127
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,680
Aw, dad,
can we keep it?

128
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,820
Huh, can we?
Can we? Can we?

129
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,480
Keep what?

130
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,750
The dog.

was gonna drown it

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,390
- if we didn't take him.
- He can't stay.

134
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,370
I got a call at 67
over at Morningside.

135
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,970
They need relief
for the next two shifts.

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,940
- I'll do it.
- What?

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,700
That's the slowest house
in the city.

138
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,810
I'll do it.

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,840
Oh, what the hell?

140
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,130
You've got a 
medical furlough, Severide.

141
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,810
That means you're medically
required to be out drinking.

142
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,780
Yeah, well...

143
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,880
this may be more
than just a furlough.

I'm moving to Spain
with Renee.

Between your history
with us

and your father's
distinguished career,

I can get you

Or the academy.
Your choice.

149

I appreciate it, Chief,
I do.

150
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,040

You okay?

157
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,900
You were right about Ernie.

158
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,800
He called,
said he was in trouble,

159
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,570
and then he hung up.

160
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,710
Right before we responded
to another dumpster fire.

161
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,440
I don't know where
to find him.

162
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,050
You tried
to help him, Chief.

163
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,910
- Did I?
- You reached out to him.

164
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,850
You invited him in.

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:42,920
Kelly, I saw him
with this man...

166
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,130
Everything about it
felt wrong.

167
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,590
And you handed it over
to the police.

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,860
And what have they done, huh?
Nothing.

Hey, I must have
misheard Cap,

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,580
because he said something
about you going to Spain.

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,880
Yeah. I was gonna
tell you this morning,

00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,820
but... I missed you.

have you known this?

You've been shot, baby.

you're about to pop.

it wasn't gonna work. Ever.

- Wow.
- Yeah, I know.

I mean, it's exactly
where I imagined my life at 30,

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,830
back with Barb and Gene
in my room,

- with the no doubt poster.
- Right.

- Yeah.
- And don't forget pregnant.

what you're thinking.

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,840
What's that?

246
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,310
That the way I live my life
finally caught up with me.

That's not
what I'm thinking.

And you would be right.

I just came back

'cause I wanted to say
thank you again.

my mom's release every year,

needs to hear to deny parole.

Ernie!

297
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,310
We take parts of bone
and cartilage from one vertebra

298
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,510
and fuse it onto the next.

299
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,010
And then we inject
your own platelets

300
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,980
into the area,
which increases healing.

301

Recovery time
could be four weeks

instead of one year.

I didn't hear about this

from my other surgeon?

This isn't covered
by an H.M.O.

It's experimental.

In four years, you've never
spoken before, Mr. Casey.

Why now?

What's changed?

325
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,060
Well, uh,
when I was seven,

326
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:11,160
I, uh, I stole a baseball mitt
from a sporting goods store.

327
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,400
I got caught,
and the owner

00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,700
wanted to call the cops,
teach me a lesson.

329
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,310
But my mom came down there
and, uh,

330
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,610
got him to agree
to let me work off

331
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,710
the cost of the mitt
by sweeping his floor.

332
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,310
And when my sister
crashed the family car,

333
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,280
my dad wanted
to kick her out of the house.

334
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,120
But my mom talked to him,

335
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,220
worked it out
where Christie could work off

336
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,490
the repairs
by cleaning dad's office.

337
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,500
What I'm trying to say is that
my mom understood punishment,

338
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,000
but she also
understood forgiveness.

339
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,600
She did a horrible thing

340
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,070
that she regrets terribly,

341
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,740
and she's paid the price

342
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,040
with 15 years
of her life.

343
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,650
But now it's time
for forgiveness,

344
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,780
from all of us.

345
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,350
We lost both our father
and our mother that day.

346
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,130
So, uh...
So what's changed?

347
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,730
Well, I have.

348
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,140
I forgive her now.

349
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,810
Okay.

350
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,340
Thank you, Mr. Casey.

351
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,710
Thank you.

352
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,350
Would anyone else
like to speak,

353
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,820
either for
or in opposition to

354
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,090
Ms. Casey's possible parole?

355
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,270
All right, then,
Ms. Casey.

356
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,610
We'll start with
a simple question.

357
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,850
Do you feel remorse
for your crime?

358
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,320
Yes.

359
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,660
Yes. Yes, I do...

360
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,690
Every day.

361
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,810
Hey, there, fellas.

362
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,550
I'm Brian Zvonecek.

363
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,350
I'm relieving here
for the next couple shifts.

364

Hey.

367
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,170
I said hey.

368
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,740
I know what you're doing.

369
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,810
Oh, yeah?
What am I doing?

370
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,620
You're not pissed at me

371
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,330
because I didn't tell you first.

372
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,490
You're pissed off because
 you don't want me to go.

373
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,160
Clarice is moving in.
She's gonna need your key.

374
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,570
[chuckles] This guy,

375
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,480
he has a heart attack
coming down the stairs.

376
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,840
I mean, his heart stops
and everything.

377
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,240
- I think heard about that.
- Yeah, yeah.

378
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,450
And we had to put
the paddles on him and...

379
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,810
[clicks mouth] he pops
 right back up,

380
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,680
like, no big deal,
you know?

381
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,820
I mean,
he completed training.

382
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,490
- I think he's over at 94.
- [man laughs]

383
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,820
Gave him the nickname
"Dead Frank."

[laughter]

385
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,190
I know where I heard
that story before.

386
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,790
You're the guy
with the podcast.

387
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,930
We love that podcast.

388
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,630
Herrmann, right?

389
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,340
He put you up to this.

390
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,540
No, nobody did.

- Yeah?

394
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,850
- Why don't you drive?
- Seriously?

395
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,280
Yeah, I'm getting tired of it.

396
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,380
Been looking for someone
to take over.

397
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,560
[engine starts]

398
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,560
It's weird
without Otis here.

399
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,900
Who am I supposed to jag?

400
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,400
Don't look at me.

401
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,760
And Severide's gone too.

402
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,870
I mean, he's as cocky
as they come,

403
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,640
but if you were
lying in the street,

404
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
he'd give you the shirt
off his back.

405
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
If you're
lying in the street,

406
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,410
why do you need
his shirt?

407
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,710
You know what I mean.

408
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,240
How many times
I gotta tell you to stay out

409
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,910
of the first watch crate,
Mouch?

410

The tempt me with
these marshmallows, Lieutenant.

411
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,780
What am I supposed to do?

412
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,920
Give me one.

413
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,760
- Hey.
- Hey.

414
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,820
- You hear anything?
- Not yet.

415
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,430
It could be a couple days.

416
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,690
Fingers crossed.

417
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,300
Thanks.

418
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,270
Chief, maybe we should
rethink the dog, eh?

419
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,300
Time 51 got one.

420
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,740
Plus, it would really
piss off Mouch.

421
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,870
No way.

422
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,770
Peter Mills,
where is that dog?

423
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,940
Um, I found a home for it.

424
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,380

A little boy?

499
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,410
Step back! We got it.

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,860
[truck beeping]

501
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,230
Nice work. [chuckles]

502
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,170
These older houses
are a tight squeeze.

503
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,870
Thanks.

504
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,110
You know, I come from
a family of doctors.

505
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,210
But the first time
I saw a firefighter

506
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,210
jump into a truck
and roar off,

507
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,110
man, I knew I wasn't
going to medical school.

508
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,820
I wanted to drive
a fire truck.

509
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,080
Your parents
okay with that?

510
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,220
Nope, but I am.

511
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,120
[laughs] Good for you.

512
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,460
Hey, you know,
this spot in our house

513
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,390
is gonna be permanent.

514
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,160
You should put in
for a transfer.

515
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,500
- What, are you serious?
- Hell, yeah.

516
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
I've laughed harder this week
than the last two years.

517
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,100
[both chuckle]

518
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,070
You should see this place
in the summertime.

519
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,000
Girls everywhere,

It's the best house

Public defender

If they wanna
have that discussion...

526
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,460
You're having it now.

527
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,130
I apprehended a suspect
in an arson and murder case,

528
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,560
a suspect with an A.P.B.
out on him

529
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,130
who the C.P.D. did not
have enough manpower...

530
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,530
Do you wanna go back
and take the cop's test?

531
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,140
Because it's not too late.

532
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,110
- Ah, come on now, Wallace.
- No, no, no.

533
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,250
These are my bugles.

534
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,920
I'm going on furlough.

535
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,880
When I get back,
you can tell me

536
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,520
if I should
put 'em back on again.

[bugles clattering]

538
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,090
Chief, I just wanna
let you...

539
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,860
Not now.

540

[car door closes]

541
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,890
I'm a stupid ass.
I know.

542
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,190
Yup.

543
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,590
And I'm sorry.
I should've...

544
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
I should've camped outside
your room

545
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,170
to tell you first.

546
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,640
You're my best friend, Shay.

547
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,640
Next time...

548
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,550
- Hey.
- [Shay laughs]

549
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,250
No next time,
I swear.

550
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,550
I'm glad you're
getting yourself healthy,

551
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,420
even if it means
I have to let you go.

552
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,390
No one's letting go.

553
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,230
Come on, let's go in.

554
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,230
- I'm cold.
- All right, yeah.

555
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,140
Hey, you know, tasers
are totally against the rules.

556
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,540
Yeah, I know that.
It's page one.

557
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,040
All you.

You...

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,320
- Hey.
- Hi.

562
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm not sure what
we're gonna do without you.

563
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,160
- [Severide exhales]
- Cheers.

[background chatter, laughter]

565
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,160
Hey.

566
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,100
Look, I promise you
that I understand,

567
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,400
you know, this is just
an opportunity

568
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,070
for us to be roommates.

569
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,240
Nothing more...

570
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,080
What was that?

571
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,480
I love you.

572
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,250
I've always loved you.

00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,020
I love you too.

574

You sure you wanna do this,
Peter Mills?

I've been waiting
 all day, baby.

576
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,640
Wanna sneak out of here?

577
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,180
Your place, ten minutes?

You're on.

Mm...

[laughter]

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,520
- Kick flips?
- No, you.

582
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,760
No, you.

583
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
I'm telling you, guys,
it wasn't that bad.

584
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:02,230
[audio muffled, fading]

585
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,750
Sorry.
Have you seen Kelly?

586
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,650
Yeah, he's over there.

587
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,420
- Or, was...
- Oh.

588
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,270
[engine turns off]

589
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,780
[distant laughter]

590
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,750
So it's 15 degrees,
and there was

591
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,420
this homeless guy
that used to hang around

592
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,690
in an alley
behind the house.

593
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,350
And we find him,
and he is frozen solid.

594
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,390
I mean,
he's a block of ice.

595
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,590
So I call the morgue
and I say, "Listen.

596
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,090
We got a frozen dead guy,
and you gotta

597
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,730
come and pick him up."

598
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,230
And they say,
"Well, he can't just be dead.

599
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,270
He's gotta be warm and dead
before we'll come and get him."

600
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,140
So we dragged the homeless guy
across to the apparatus floor,

601
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,470
and we wait for him
to thaw out,

602
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,570
for about ten hours.

603
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,710
Anyway, eventually
he got warm enough

604
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,740
and dead enough
to actually be dead,

605
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,250
so they came and got him.

606
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,320
You still telling
that one?

607
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,650
Well, I'll be damned.

608
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,760
- Guys.
- Hey.

609
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,790
- How you doing?
- Dad.

610
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,230
- You want something to eat?
- Oh, nah.

611
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,500
I'm good, thanks.

612
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,240
Uh... [deep breath]

613
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,280
I'm leaving the C.F.D.

614
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,280
What happens when
you and this Renee

615
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,880
get tired of each other,
and you find yourself

616
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,190
in some godforsaken country
with nothing to show for it

617
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,750
- but a pension?
- I don't know.

618
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,820
This doesn't look so bad.

619
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,220
Trust me.

620
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,290
You're worried about
partial paralysis?

621
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,830
How about full paralysis?

622
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,900
'Cause that's what this is.

623
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,240
There is no replacing
rescue squad...

624
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,180
But you already know that.

625
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,750
That's why
you came out here,

626
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,890
so I could talk you
out of going.

627
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,830
Look. I know I wasn't
there for you

628
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,930
like I could've been
or should've been,

629
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,630
and I'm three wives
removed from your mother

630
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,300
and I'm in no position
to give you advice.

631
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,740
But you're scared, Kelly.

632
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,810
And you know
why you're scared?

633
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,240
'Cause you're not ready
for this.

634
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,910
Bennie, you ready?

635
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,960
She's counting on me.
I promised her.

636
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,860
She'll get over it.

637
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,960
Disappoint anyone...
Hell, disappoint everyone,

638
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:22,230
but don't ever
disappoint yourself.

639
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,710
It's good to see you.

640
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,840
You too, pop.

641
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,360

[distant siren]

643
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,750
Hey.

644
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,290
What's going on?

645
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,060
I'm, uh...

646
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,930
I'm gonna get the surgery.

647
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,300
Oh, Kelly, come on.

648
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,870
It's... It's just not
worth the risk.

649
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,670
I mean,
we'll do it right.

650
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,840
You'll come with me.

651
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,040
You'll recuperate
in Madr...

652
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,450
You wanna stay.

653
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,030
I should've known. [chuckles]

654
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,840
I was that close
to not even telling you.

655
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,940
And you would've
come with me to Madrid.

656
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,840
And... the sky would've
been the limit for us.

657
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,950
Hey, hey.

658
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,750
What you did might be
the most important thing

659
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,820
anyone's ever done for me.

660
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:31,360
Thank you.

661
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,110
Well, uh...
I guess now we're even.

662
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,010
Yeah. We're even.

663
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,190
[knock at door]

664
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,690
Shonda.

665
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,500
Wallace.

666
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,830
Can I please see Jimmy?

667
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,900
No.

668
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,170
- He's not your son.
- The hell he ain't.

669
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,710
I raised him
from the time he was three.

670
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,710
Never used the word
"stepson."

671
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,540
Not once.

672
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,480
I need to see him.

673
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,090
[dog barks]

674
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,590
Hey. Ralphie.

675
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,630
How are you?
I miss you, boy.

676
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,570
Dad.

677
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,750
[murmurs emotionally]

678
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,010
[tap on glass]

679
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,550
You ready?

680
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,220
Yeah. I'm ready.

681
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:28,090
