00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:59,014
ABOMINABLE!

166
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,015
REGARDEZ.

167
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:02,017
VOILA, MONSIEUR
DAVID WARFIELD.

168
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:05,020
THAT TYCOON WHO OWNS
THOSE SLEAZY TABLOIDS?

169
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,522
AU CONTRAIRE,
MON AMI.

170
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:08,524
HE OWNS THOSE
SLEAZY TABLOIDS

171
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:10,526
Both:AND THEDAILY PLANET.

172
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,027
TEDIOUS.

173
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:14,029
DON'T TELL ME
YOU ONLY READ PICTURES.

174
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:18,534
THE FACT IS, MR. WHITE,
THAT I ONLY READ THE LEDGER,

175
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:21,537
A LEDGER WHICH
THE PREVIOUS OWNERS

176
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:23,038
PAID SO LITTLE
ATTENTION TO,

177
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:26,041
I BOUGHT THE PAPER
OUT FROM UNDER THEM.

178
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,544
IT HASN'T MADE ANY MONEY
IN THREE YEARS!

179
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:31,046
AND THE NAME OF THE GAME
IS MAKING MONEY.

180
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:34,550
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
MY DAUGHTER,

181
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,051
LACY WARFIELD.

182
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:37,052
THANKS, DADDY.

183
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:39,054
IT'S VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU, MA'AM.

184
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:42,558
MR. WHITE,
LACY WILL BE HELPING YOU.

185
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:45,060
HELPING ME?
HELPING ME WHAT?

186
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,062
I HAVE SOME MOCK COPIES

187
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:50,065
OF OUR NEW LAYOUT.
SUPER, ISN'T IT?

188
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:52,568
THE SUIT'S NOT RIGHT,
BUT WE'LL CHANGE IT.

189
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:54,570
EXCUSE ME, MR. WARFIELD,

190
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,572
BUT THE WORLD ISN'T
REALLY ON THE BRINK.

191
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:59,074
ISN'T THAT HEADLINE
IRRESPONSIBLE?

192
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:01,577
MAYBE, BUT IT'LL SELL
A LOT OF NEWSPAPERS.

193
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:05,080
DON'T DO ANYTHING RASH.

194
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,083
I WON'T LET YOU TURN
THIS GRAND OLD LADY

195
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,084
INTO ONE OF YOUR BIMBOS!

196
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:10,085
MR. WHITE.

197
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,589
MAY I POINT OUT THAT DADDY
HOLDS ALL YOUR CONTRACTS,

198
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,091
WHICH YOU WILL
HAVE TO HONOR.

199
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:19,094
EXCUSEZ-MOI...
YOUR SPOILEDNESS.

200
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:21,597
WHY IS LOIS TRYING
TO SPEAK FRENCH?

201
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:23,098
I'M FLYING TO PARIS

202
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:25,601
FOR THE EMERGENCY
MINISTERS CONFERENCE--

203
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:29,104
NOT SO FAST.
ALL TRIPS ARE CANCELED.

204
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:32,107
MY TRIP TO PARIS
IS CANCELED?

205
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:34,610
MR. WHITE,
SHOW ME YOUR BOOKS.

206
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,613
EVERYBODY ELSE,
GET BACK TO WORK.

207
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,615
WE'RE BEING
TREATED UNFAIRLY.

208
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:40,616
I'LL SPEAK
TO MISS WARFIELD.

209
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:41,617
ME, TOO.

210
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:42,618
EXCUSE ME,
MISS WARFIELD?

211
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:43,619
YES?

212
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,621
I THINK I SPEAK FOR
ALL OF US WHEN I SAY

213
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,623
THAT WE'LL ALL DO
OUR BEST TO COOPERATE.

214
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,124
THANK YOU.

215
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,626
BUT A REPORTER'S
FIRST ALLEGIANCE

216
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:52,127
IS TO THE TRUTH.

217
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:55,130
THIS CITY'S PEOPLE
DEPEND ON US.

218
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,132
WE CAN'T
LET THEM DOWN.

219
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:58,634
THANK YOU.

220
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,140
IS HE FOR REAL?

221
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,144
100%, AND I LIKE
HIM THAT WAY, OK?

222
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,647
YOU HAVE
A THING FOR HIM?

223
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:14,149
FOR CLARK?
NO! HA HA HA!

224
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:16,151
HE'S KIND OF CUTE.

225
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,654
UH, LOOK,
MISS WARFIELD...

226
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:22,157
CLARK IS THE OLDEST
LIVING BOY SCOUT, OK?

227
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,660
HE'S TRUSTWORTHY,
HE'S HELPFUL,

228
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,662
HE'S LOYAL,
 HE'S OBEDIENT,

229
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:28,163
HE...

230
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:31,166
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TELL YOU THIS.

231
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,671
I JUST DON'T THINK HE'D BE
ATTRACTED TO SOMEBODY LIKE YOU.

232
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:38,173
DON'T BE SILLY.
ALL MEN LIKE ME.

233
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:40,175
I'M VERY, VERY RICH.

234
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:43,595
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
AIR TRAVEL EXPENSES?

235
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,597
I USUALLY
GET AIR SICK,

236
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,599
ESPECIALLY
WHEN IT'S BUMPY.

237
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,102
LOIS, GET IN HERE!

238
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,606
LOIS, EXPLAIN THIS
COLUMN OF FIGURES.

239
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,609
CHIEF, THE PRESIDENT'S
COMING ON LIVE.

240
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,111
OH, HE IS? OH.

241
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,113
I DOUBT
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

242
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,115
IT WON'T BE
THAT TERRIBLE.

243
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,617
HOPEFULLY,
VERY TERRIBLE, MISS LANE.

244
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,619
WE COULD DOUBLE
OUR CIRCULATION

245
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,122
WITH A GOOD
INTERNATIONAL CRISIS.

246
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,624
AND BECAUSE
THE SUMMIT HAS FAILED,

247
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,626
WE HAVE NO CHOICE

248
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,629
BUT TO STRIVE
TO BE SECOND TO NONE

249
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,631
IN THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE.

250
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:24,136
THEREFORE, I AM ANNOUNCING 
THE FOLLOWING MEASURES--

251
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,642
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL UPSET
BY THE CRISIS.

252
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:34,646
THE BEST THING WE CAN DO
IS THINK POSITIVELY.

253
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,150
NOW, IS THERE
ANYTHING WE CAN DO?

254
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,152
DOESN'T ANYONE
HAVE A SUGGESTION?

255
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,155
ALL RIGHT.

256
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,157
I'LL MAKE A SUGGESTION.

257
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,160
LET'S WRITE
OUR CONGRESSMEN.

258
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,162
THAT'LL DO
A LOT OF GOOD.

259
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:54,166
SOMEBODY HAS TO BE
AN OPTIMIST.

260
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,667
JEREMY?

261
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,172
WHAT CAN WE DO
ABOUT THE CRISIS?

262
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,673
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

263
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:06,678
I'D WRITE A LETTER TO SOMEONE
THAT WOULD DO SOME GOOD.

264
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,180
WHO, SANTA CLAUS?

265
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,682
NO! SUPERMAN!

266
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,185
SUPERMAN, THE SUBJECT
OF OUR NEWEST EXHIBIT,

267
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,188
HAS GRACIOUSLY DONATED A STRAND
OF HIS HAIR TO THE MUSEUM,

268
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,691
SO WE CAN SEE HOW STRONG
HE REALLY IS.

269
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,694
HERE YOU CAN SEE
A 1,000-POUND LOAD

270
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,696
EASILY SUSPENDED
BY HIS SINGLE HAIR.

271
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,199
THE MUSEUM WILL
BE CLOSING SOON,

272
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,202
SO WE SHOULD
HURRY A LITTLE.

273
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,206
YOU KNOW WHAT
I CAN DO WITH THAT HAIR?

274
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,709
YOU CAN MAKE
A TOUPEE THAT FLIES.

275
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,211
THAT HAIR IS A SAMPLE

276
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,213
OF SUPERMAN'S
GENETIC MATERIAL,

277
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,715
THE BUILDING BLOCKS
OF HIS BODY.

278
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,219
WITH ENOUGH NUCLEAR POWER
TO MUTATE THE GENES,

279
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:52,224
I CAN CREATE A BEING WHO'S
MORE POWERFUL THAN HIM,

280
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,727
WHO HAS TOTAL
ALLEGIANCE TO ME.

281
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,230
[SNAP]

282
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,737
YOU BETTER
STAND BACK.

283
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,240
KEEP YOUR EYE OUT.

284
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,244
[ALARM]

285
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:39,688
YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME?

286
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:42,691
YEAH, HI, CLARK.
PLEASE, COME IN.

287
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,694
I'VE COME UP WITH
A BRILLIANT IDEA.

288
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,195
OH...REALLY?

289
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:49,197
WELL, DADDY THINKS
IT'S BRILLIANT.

290
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:51,199
YOU'LL WRITE THIS NEW SERIES

291
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,201
CALLEDMETROPOLIS AFTER HOURS.

292
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,203
WHO, ME? I...

293
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:57,205
IT'S WONDERFUL.

294
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:59,207
IT'S GREAT,
ISN'T IT?

295
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:01,209
I'M NOT
RIGHT FOR THIS.

296
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:03,211
YOU'RE PERFECT
FOR IT.

297
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:04,212
YOU'RE YOUNG,

298
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,214
YOU'RE SINGLE,
YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL.

299
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,717
I'M USUALLY
IN BED BY 10:30.

300
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:11,219
THAT'S JUST IT.
YOU DON'T FLAUNT IT.

301
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:13,722
YOU'RE NO SLAVE
TO FASHION, ALTHOUGH...

302
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,724
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED 
USING CONTACTS?

303
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:18,727
UH, THEY, UH,
MAKE MY EYES ITCH.

304
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:22,731
LISTEN, I THOUGHT WE
COULD DO THIS TOGETHER.

305
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,233
I KNOW ALL
THE RIGHT PLACES.

306
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,736
I BELONG
TO THE RIGHT CLUBS.

307
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,738
WE'LL START TONIGHT
AT THE METRO CLUB.

308
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:31,239
OH, TONIGHT?

309
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,741
YEAH. IT'S A DATE.

310
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,242
A DATE?

311
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:35,243
A DATE?

312
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:37,746
UH, WELL, IT'S JUST 
BUSINESS, ACTUALLY.

313
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:41,750
I'VE GOT A LETTER
FOR SUPERMAN, CARE OF ME.

314
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,752
SUPERMAN
GETS MAIL HERE?

315
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:46,254
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
A PICTURE REQUEST.

316
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:47,255
I COULD LOOK AFTER
IT FOR YOU, LOIS.

317
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:49,758
I THINK IT'S MORE
THAN A FAN LETTER.

318
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,760
I THINK YOU
SHOULD READ IT.

319
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,263
"DEAR SUPERMAN,
MY TEACHER IS SPEAKING

320
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:57,265
"ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S
SPEECH ON THE ARMS RACE.

321
00:21:57,265 --> 00:22:01,770

OK, YOU TRY IT NOW.

648
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,771
OK.

649
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,775
LET'S SET IT
A LITTLE HIGHER FOR YOU.

650
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,777
JUST PUSH DOWN.

651
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,781
ARE YOU OK?

652
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,283
NEED SOME HELP?

653
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,784
JUST STEP DOWN.

654
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,286
THANK YOU.

655
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,289
YOUR FRIEND DOESN'T
KNOW HIS OWN STRENGTH.

656
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,291
CLARK,
THIS IS PAUL.

657
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,293
HE'S A TRAINER
HERE.

658
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,296
I GOT JUST
THE THING FOR YOU.

660
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,299
CLARKEY?

661
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,305
IT'S NICE OF HIM
TO HELP ME OUT.

662
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,307
HERE, TRY THIS ONE.

663
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,309
OH, CLARK,
ARE YOU OK?

664
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,310
YEAH.

665
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,311
SORRY.

666
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,313
NO PAIN, NO GAIN.

667
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,317
JEEZ, WHAT A JERK.

668
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,319
I NEVER
REALIZED IT BEFORE.

669
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:19,323
I GUESS A LOT OF
PEOPLE I KNOW ARE JERKS.

670
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,826
MAYBE YOU THINK I'M ONE,
SO YOU AVOID ME.

671
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,828
NO, I DON'T THINK THAT.

672
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,831
I'VE JUST BEEN REALLY
BUSY, THAT'S ALL.

673
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,835
YOU KNOW LOIS IS DOING
THAT INTERVIEW WITH SUPERMAN

674
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,837
ABOUT HIS PEACE MISSION?

675
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,841
MAYBE THE FOUR OF US
COULD MEET FOR HIGH TEA.

676
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,843
IT'S VERY CHIC.

677
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,345
Paul: COULD YOU HAND ME
THOSE WEIGHTS, CLARK?

678
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,846
UH, EXCUSE ME.

679
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,848
WAIT A MINUTE,
LACY.

680
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,849
COME EARLY.

681
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,851
THE VIEW IS SO ROMANTIC
FROM MY BALCONY.

682
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,852
SEE YA.

683
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,356
OH, SURE. HERE.

[LOW-PITCHED HUM]

687
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:09,323
WHAT WAS THAT?

688
00:45:11,825 --> 00:45:14,328
UNCLE LEX,
YOU'RE SPOOKING ME OUT.

689
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:17,331

THANK YOU

00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:49,363
I'M INCREDIBLE.

INTERNALLY GENERATED HEAT.

I AM THE FATHER NOW.

707
00:46:40,914 --> 00:46:41,915
YOU HAVE MY VOICE.

708
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:45,419
NO, YOU HAVEMYVOICE.

00:46:45,419 --> 00:46:47,921
JUST REMEMBER,
I MADE YOU.

710
00:46:47,921 --> 00:46:50,424
YOU'RE JUST
AN EXPERIMENT, FREAKO.

00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:54,428
WHAT'S THAT?

712
00:46:54,928 --> 00:46:55,929
OH, NO.

713
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,931
I'M AN EXPERIMENT?

I'M FREAKO?

IF ANYONE'S FREAKO HERE,
IT'S GOT TO BE ME!

OH, WOW!

00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:18,952
DESTROY.

722
00:47:19,453 --> 00:47:21,955
DESTROY SUPERMAN NOW.

723
00:47:21,955 --> 00:47:25,459
YOU SWEET THING!
BUT NOT QUITE YET.

UNCLE LEX.

727

HE'S, LIKE...
HE'S, LIKE, COLD.

00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:51,485
OF COURSE HE IS.

730
00:47:51,985 --> 00:47:53,487
THAT'S
HIS VULNERABILITY.

731
00:47:53,987 --> 00:47:55,989
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
HE CAN BE STOPPED.

732
00:47:55,989 --> 00:47:57,991
WHAT?

733
00:47:58,492 --> 00:48:00,994
LENNY,
MY LOUD-MOUTH NEPHEW,

734
00:48:00,994 --> 00:48:02,996
HE GETS HIS ENERGY
FROM THE SUN.

735
00:48:02,996 --> 00:48:05,999
WITHOUT IT, HE'S
LIKE YOU AT NIGHT...

736
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:07,000
USELESS.

737
00:48:21,515 --> 00:48:22,983

739
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:30,691
YOU KNOW, I NEVER HAD
A DOUBLE DATE BEFORE.

740
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:34,194
THIS IS FUN.
HOW DO I LOOK?

UH, LISTEN, LACY,

00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:43,203
I DON'T WANT
TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE,

745
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:46,206
BUT CLARK WON'T NOTICE
WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

OH, MAYBE IT'S
JUST SUPERMAN.

NO.

A DIFFERENT KIND OF ENTRANCE.

HAVE ANY CHANGE.

HI, CLARK.

760
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,743
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
THESE QUESTIONS

761
00:49:22,743 --> 00:49:25,746
MR. WARFIELD GAVE ME
TO ASK SUPERMAN.

"ARE YOU PART OF A PLOT TO
WEAKEN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE?"

HOW CAN I ASK SUPERMAN
THESE QUESTIONS?

THAT'S A VERY
ATTRACTIVE OUTFIT.

I THINK WE BETTER
START OUR INTERVIEW.

OR SOME OTHER GOOD DEED.

788
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:36,316
SOMETHING
SMELLS WONDERFUL.

789
00:50:36,316 --> 00:50:37,818
OH, THANK YOU.

792
00:50:43,323 --> 00:50:46,326
IN CASE WE GOT
HUNGRY AFTERWARDS.

793
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:48,829
UH...I MEAN, LATER.

794
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:53,333
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE
TO ALL THAT TROUBLE.

795
00:50:58,338 --> 00:51:01,341
SHOULD WE GET ON
WITH THE INTERVIEW?

796
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:04,344
YES, LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

CONFISCATING
THE MISSILES?

801
00:51:12,352 --> 00:51:14,354
THERE ALWAYS WAS
THE POSSIBILITY

802
00:51:14,354 --> 00:51:15,355
THAT SOME WARPED
INDIVIDUALS

803
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:17,357
WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE

804
00:51:17,357 --> 00:51:19,860
OF THE WORLD'S
GOOD WILL, BUT--

805
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:22,863
IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

806
00:51:26,867 --> 00:51:28,869
OH, MY DINNER!

807
00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:30,871
UM, I'LL BE 
RIGHT BACK!

808
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:46,887
HI.

I MISSED YOU, CLARK.

810
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:52,392
IT'S SO BORING UP THERE

YOU'D BETTER HAVE
AN EXPLANATION, WHITE,

MUST HAVE BEEN
ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL,

1155
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,594
BECAUSE I CONVINCED
THE BANKERS OF THIS CITY

THAT OURDAILY PLANET
