1
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:47,049
Come on. Let's go, guys.
I'm missing the Oscars.

2
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:16,803
-Calabrese, nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you too.

3
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,086
This is our friend I told you about.

4
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,925
Calabrese.

5
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:23,972
I know you.

6
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:26,443
Who are these other mystery guests?

7
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:33,242
Murder is a very serious
business, my friend.

8
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:35,768
And an expensive one.

9
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:39,050
You'll be very well compensated,
Mr. Calabrese.

10
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:41,972
Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.

11
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:43,971
You can take that to the bank.

12
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,124
Slo wly. Slo wly.

13
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:48,645
And always with caution.

14
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:52,766
Listen! I want you to turn
Senator Caldwell into a memory.

15
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:56,363
I'm not waiting for him
to die of natural causes.

16
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,242
All I'm counseling is patience.

17
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:02,883
The man is public.
He's in the papers every day.

18
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:05,931
Next time I read about him,
it better be the obituaries.

19
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:07,885
Who are you?

20
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:10,086
Get out of the shadows.

21
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:11,612
Enough bullshit.

22
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:15,932
-Can you do this job or not?
-It'll be taken care of.

23
00:03:16,573 --> 00:03:20,361
Gentlemen, enough bickering.
This is business.

24
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:24,362
I think we understand each other.

25
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:27,124
Then let's just stick to business.

26
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:31,607
It's a light plane.

27
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,925
A Lear P-61 .

28
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:38,292
We want it to take off.
We don't want it to land.

29
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,368
You told me this dock was clean.

30
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,849
Mikey! Quit playing
with yourself back there.

31
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:12,972
-Get that bastard!
-Let's get out of here.

32
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:40,367
I don't want him to get an hour older!

33
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,609
He won't, Mr. Assemblyman.

34
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:47,405
No kidding.

35
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:52,047
-And the winner is--
-Ben Kingsley for Gandhi !

36
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:56,086
Amigo , are you deaf?

37
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:58,931
Storm on 3.

38
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:01,962
Line 3.

39
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,566
Throwing away dimes now?

40
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:07,646
This doesn't go out.
For your ears only.

41
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:13,763
What?

42
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:16,203
Calabrese.
I got his ass on film.

43
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:17,972
You're full of shit.

44
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:22,525
Him and his pet cockroach, Valero.
On film and audio, laying out a hit.

45
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:26,282
Two guys I couldn 't make out.
I think they'll come up on film.

46
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:30,652
I think this is the big one.
Our own little Academy Award.

47
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:32,566
It's good. Ready?

48
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,964
-Shoot.
-Listen, Carlito.

49
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,003
Nobody but us knows about this.

50
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:43,573
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

51
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:50,452
-How you doing tonight?
-What can I do for you?

52
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:52,570
Got any champagne?

53
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,844
Right next to the caviar.

54
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,245
-That was funny.
-Great.

55
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:00,843
In the big cooler back there.

56
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:03,926
How come you're not watching
the Oscars tonight?

57
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:06,049
The Oscars?

58
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:08,766
I hate the Oscars.

59
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:10,526
You're not having a good time?

60
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:13,207
Who needs the goddamn movies?

61
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:17,013
I got a show in here every night.

62
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:18,811
You got horror, sex. . .

63
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,244
. . .freaks, violence.

64
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:24,488
And I don't got to pay no 4 bucks.

65
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,006
You should film it.
Get your own show.

66
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,130
I'll be great in a porno.

67
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,011
Better dial 91 1 .

68
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,086
You don't want to call 91 1 .

69
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,925
Holy shit!

70
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:44,770
You remember me, viejo ?

71
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:46,927
That's right.

72
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:48,608
You remember.

73
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,322
He grew some hair
since we last seen him.

74
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:52,483
Not a lot!

75
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:53,643
Where's the rug?

76
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:58,652
You know what I want.
Go ahead!

77
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:00,121
Move!

78
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,285
That's my money!

79
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:07,850
Take my life savings.

80
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,285
Where's a cop when you need one?

81
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:14,724
They're out eating doughnuts.

82
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:20,727
I got half a mind to bash your--

83
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:27,807
Now you only got half a mind.

84
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:30,165
Take him out, man.

85
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:32,772
Let's go, hero!

86
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,851
That's it, right here.
What are you grinning at?

87
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:37,572
You know. . .

88
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,488
. . .there's only four of you guys. . .

89
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:43,412
. . .and you only have one shot left.

90
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:55,692
Go low, man!

91
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,451
Get the maricón, man!

92
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:03,049
What are you doing on the ground?!

93
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,051
I'll cut your heart out!

94
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,722
Yeah? Come and cut my heart out.

95
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:17,970
Come and cut my heart out.

96
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:19,686
Come on, punk.

97
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:23,688
I know what you're thinking.
Mine's bigger than yours.

98
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:25,412
It's not fair.

99
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,171
I'll throw it away.

100
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:32,282
What if I show you
what it's like to be a victim?

101
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,762
-Come on.
-You're fucking dead, man!

102
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:40,642
It's still not fair.
Okay, I'll get down on my knees.

103
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:42,241
Better?

104
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:45,328
Come get some.

105
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:51,162
Looks like you won the Oscar, Storm.

106
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,363
You'll be very well compensated,
Mr. Calabrese.

107
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,569
Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.

108
00:09:14,813 --> 00:09:16,769
You can take that to the bank.

109
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,168
I know that voice.

110
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,371
Is that you, honey?

111
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:06,487
Yeah, baby.

112
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,405
In the flesh.

113
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,612
What are you doing?
Come on.

114
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:26,605
I'm raiding the icebox.

115
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:29,202
I gave up my diet for Lent.

116
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:34,606
Champagne?

117
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:38,003
Does that put you in the mood?

118
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,251
Think this could do it?

119
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:52,327
I had to bribe him to go to bed
with six cookies. . .

120
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,285
. . .and a glass of orange juice.

121
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:01,283
I wish I could sleep like that.

122
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,524
Maybe I can help you.

123
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:06,048
Is that for me, Dad?

124
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,766
You faker.

125
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:14,372
Here you go.

126
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:16,292
There you go.

127
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:21,210
-Did you say your prayers?
-I wanted to do them with you.

128
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:26,330
There's a trick to getting
what you want when you say prayers.

129
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,330
What, Daddy?

130
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:32,407
You ask for things for other people,
like your mom and Uncle O'Malley.

131
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,730
Then how do I get stuff for myself?

132
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:38,607
That's why God invented work.

133
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:41,768
Want to say a little prayer with me?
Come here.

134
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,764
Want to say your prayers?

135
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:48,966
Now I lay me down to sleep.

136
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:53,561
And we say together:
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

137
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:56,362
If I die before I wake. . .

138
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:59,451
. . .I pray the Lord my soul to take.

139
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:01,490
Amen. Very good.

140
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,171
Good night, Dad.

141
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:14,485
Sleep well, champ.

142
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:20,246
Here's to us.

143
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,363
I had a shitty day today.

144
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,325
There's blood on your shirt.

145
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:43,165
It's not my blood.

146
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:45,768
So you don't have to worry.

147
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,972
If people knew how sweet you are. . .

148
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,968
. . .they'd never be scared of you.

149
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,286
I'm not scared of you.

150
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,451
Maybe you should be.

151
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:24,765
We'll try to squeeze it in.

152
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,001
I'm in a silly mood.

153
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,570
I love you.

154
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:51,764
I love you too.

155
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:50,481
I'm ready.

156
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:52,889
What?

157
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:01,963
Motherfuckers!

158
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,288
Mason!

159
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:12,088
Sweet dreams.

160
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:28,371
Becker! Storm on 3!

161
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:40,767
I got the coke on the dresser.
Put yours in the nightstand.

162
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,772
I got it.

163
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:45,172
Fix his ass!

164
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:51,969
Got all the tapes?

165
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:54,326
A shitload. Hurry!

166
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:56,365
Just hurry!

167
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,402
The kid!

168
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:05,091
Get that kid and kill him!

169
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:17,411
That fucking Storm!

170
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:21,163
Get your ass in the van
and stop complaining.

171
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:25,570
-What happened, Max?
-Another dead asshole. Let's go!

172
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:36,531
Assemblyman Trent,
when did you meet Mason Storm?

173
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:38,889
I've known him since. . .

174
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,452
Jesus Christ!

175
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:42,844
. . .I was City Attorney. . .

176
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,164
. . .and he was a young. . .

177
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:47,211
. . .homicide detective.

178
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:49,852
We worked together. . . .

179
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:54,769
We worked on several cases.

180
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,163
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

181
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:00,441
Assemblyman Vernon Trent. . .

182
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:03,969
. . .distraught over the loss
of an officer he knew.

183
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:08,168
Terrible circumstances here
outside the emergency room. . .

184
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:12,406
. . .and a calamity-filled mob scene
of policemen. . . .

185
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,212
What makes people do this?

186
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:18,563
Would somebody please tell me that!

187
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:21,883
Hulland!

188
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:23,409
Captain Hulland!

189
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:32,531
Is he a national treasure?

190
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,048
Blood pressure: 70 over 40.

191
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:40,366
I get no pulse.

192
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:43,088
They always said Storm was superhuman.

193
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:46,166
Know why?
He was jacked up on coke.

194
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:51,964
I'll tell you something.
He was the cleanest man I knew.

195
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:54,687
He had more honor than
this whole department.

196
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:57,772
If I ever hear you
talk that puke again. . .

197
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:00,089
. . .I'll put you where you belong.

198
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:02,363
What the fuck is l.A. doing here?

199
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,450
-Taking over the show.
-Bullshit!

200
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:06,928
This is Homicide, not lnternal Affairs.

201
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,567
We got 2 cops down with
money and drugs all over.

202
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:11,968
This came from the commissioner.

203
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:13,883
Capt. Hulland?

204
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:17,812
Storm is dead.

205
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:31,807
O'Malley. . .

206
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,565
. . .I know you and Storm were tight.

207
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,564
For what it's worth. . .

208
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,566
. . .I'm sorry.

209
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:50,369
The most unstoppable
son of a bitch I ever knew.

210
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:54,209
He got stopped tonight.

211
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:06,043
Excuse me.
Are you with the police?

212
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,164
Lt. O'Malley.
What do you got?

213
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:11,172
A live cop is what I've got.

214
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:16,563
-Lieutenant, what's happening?
-No comment. It's over.

215
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:21,967
We've got a pulse.

216
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:24,568
Your man's alive, Lieutenant.

217
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:27,089
Who else knows he isn't dead?

218
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:28,931
Just the people in here.

219
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:31,084
I want to see each of them.

220
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:34,842
And no one else comes in here
as of now. You got that?

221
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,968
Lieutenant, this is still a hospital.

222
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,169
I appreciate your problem.

223
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:48,405
But I'm acting under orders
of the police commissioner.

224
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:51,406
-I hope you can document that.
-I can and will.

225
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:57,249
Mason Storm's going to vanish,
and you'll help make that happen.

226
00:19:57,693 --> 00:20:02,369
Till he can give us some answers,
the deader he is, the safer he is.

227
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,812
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm in your corner.

228
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:30,489
--and you can take that to the bank!

229
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:36,884
The governor appointed
Assemblyman Vernon Trent...

230
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:41,524
... to the Senate seat vacated by
the tragic death of Caldwell.

231
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:49,089
You inspire me to work harder.
I will not tolerate crime.

232
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:53,043
And you can take that to the bank!

233
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:11,651
It's 6 a.m.

234
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:13,042
Morning, Martha.

235
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:17,050
What do we got?
"lnquiring minds want to know"?

236
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:21,212
Doctor Carlin's ordered
a glucose drip for Jimmy C.

237
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:24,963
Max's E.E.G. monitor's
developing a nice electronic hiccup.

238
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:26,606
Poor Max!

239
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:29,526
And your boyfriend turned his head.

240
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,002
He did?

241
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:35,570
I thought he was going to sit up.
I almost shit.

242
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:40,563
See you for a cup of tea
in a few minutes.

243
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:47,162
I knew it.

244
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:02,445
You moved your head today,
you little devil.

245
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:05,282
Let's see,
what can I do for you here?

246
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:12,211
Very nice!

247
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:15,488
Great.

248
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:19,202
I've got a little surprise for you.

249
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:20,846
Be right back.

250
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:28,207
Would you like a little pussy?

251
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:31,684
A little bitty pussy.
Look what I've got here.

252
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:40,289
John Doe, can you hear me?

253
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:45,924
I know my words are getting through.
I don't care what the doctors say.

254
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,452
I'm going to keep
talking to you today. . .

255
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:53,807
. . .and tomorrow and the day after,
till you respond.

256
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:58,092
Besides, you've got so much to live for.

257
00:22:59,173 --> 00:23:01,050
Please wake up!

258
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,483
Got to go see Jimmy C.

259
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:08,642
Bye.

260
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,966
Stupid machine.

261
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:58,841
Nurse.

262
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:00,567
Nurse.

263
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,932
We'll run some tests.
Alert X-ray for a CAT scan.

264
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:12,365
Call the lab.
We need a complete blood work-up.

265
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:26,201
John Doe.

266
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:28,571
Here we are.

267
00:25:34,693 --> 00:25:37,207
Internal Affairs.
Detective Sergeant Goodhart.

268
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:41,691
My name's Andrea Stewart. I'm calling
from the L.A. Coma Research Center.

269
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:44,686
I'd like to speak to
Captain O'Malley, please.

270
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,324
What is this in regards to?

271
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:50,844
I have a John Doe coma patient,
code access 461 -Zebra. . .

272
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:54,204
. . .with instructions to notify
in case of change in condition.

273
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,081
What's the change?

274
00:25:56,453 --> 00:25:59,763
The patient has come out
of a coma after 7 years.

275
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:02,203
Nolan, get Hulland, quick.

276
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:10,646
I'm sorry, Captain O'Malley's
no longer with this division.

277
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:12,287
I'll take the information.

278
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,605
And please, contact
no one else on this matter.

279
00:26:15,813 --> 00:26:18,202
It would be better
for the patient's welfare.

280
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,723
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

281
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:26,488
President Bush has caught
the public eye with his antics.

282
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:29,247
From throwing the first ball
on opening day...

283
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:32,411
... to kissing a pig
for the farmers ' affections.

284
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:35,486
George Bush is becoming
a real crowd-pleaser.

285
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:39,848
This is Andrew Louis
for Cable Hospital News.

286
00:26:47,013 --> 00:26:48,731
What year is it?

287
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,930
-Try not to talk.
-What year is it?

288
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:54,811
It's 1 990.

289
00:26:58,293 --> 00:27:00,761
Your charts go back for 7 years.

290
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,847
Do you have any recollection
of anything?

291
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:09,209
I remember everything.

292
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:13,685
You're the first patient
to come out of a coma of this duration.

293
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,288
You'll be famous.
You'll be on the news.

294
00:27:16,613 --> 00:27:18,490
Listen to me very carefully.

295
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,412
I'm a cop.

296
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:24,772
My wife and family were murdered.

297
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:27,169
That's how I got here.

298
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:31,490
If you don't get me out
of this hospital. . .

299
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:35,051
. . .within an hour, we'll both be dead.

300
00:27:35,373 --> 00:27:37,523
You're my cutest patient,
but not my only one.

301
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:40,167
-You're making a mistake.
-I'll be back.

302
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:42,483
No! Don't go.

303
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:51,411
How's it going, brother?

304
00:27:52,293 --> 00:27:53,328
Who are you?

305
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:58,084
I'm Danny, the physical therapist.
I'm going to give you a massage.

306
00:27:58,413 --> 00:28:00,927
-I'll make you feel all right.
-Get the fuck out.

307
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,203
I'll just take you down the hall.

308
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:15,892
Can I see your list of patients
in your coma care unit?

309
00:28:20,693 --> 00:28:25,130
Get me out. Thanks for the massage,
but stop and get me out of here.

310
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,650
Just relax. You'll get out
of here real soon, I promise.

311
00:28:29,453 --> 00:28:31,523
Morning, Sheri.
How you doing?

312
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:37,329
Thank you.

313
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:39,329
Thank you.

314
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:47,693
-You know that doctor?
-No.

315
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,251
John Doe!

316
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:34,289
Excuse me.

317
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:35,761
Doctor?

318
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:40,771
I have to check everyone
on these floors.

319
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:43,485
Can I get your l.D., please?

320
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,563
You can't have too much security.

321
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:57,324
If you feel up to it, I'll get you some
lemon chiffon pie out of the freezer.

322
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:58,926
Get me out of here.

323
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:01,249
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of you.

324
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:03,921
If you want, I'll hook you up
with some pizza.

325
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:06,243
You got to learn to relax.

326
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,768
Orderly!
Give me a little help.

327
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:12,125
Give me some help down here!

328
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:18,728
What's he doing down there?!

329
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:20,687
What's wrong?

330
00:31:21,253 --> 00:31:22,527
Russ!

331
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:24,172
What happened?

332
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:25,369
He's dead.

333
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,364
My poor back!

334
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:17,172
You son of a bitch!

335
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:26,929
Storm, you son of a bitch!

336
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:49,242
Oh, my God!

337
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,171
Russ! Danny!

338
00:33:27,013 --> 00:33:28,924
I'll get you, Storm!

339
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:53,003
J.D. !

340
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:54,687
Oh, my God!

341
00:33:56,813 --> 00:33:58,690
Now will you listen to me?

342
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:05,887
Hold tight!

343
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:09,042
Sorry.

344
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,083
Stop!

345
00:34:11,813 --> 00:34:12,609
Hang on!

346
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:21,167
Watch out!

347
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,045
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are going to put a stop to it. . .

348
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,086
. . .and we're going to start right here!

349
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:34,083
We are going to put an end. . .

350
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:39,088
. . .to violence in this state.
And you can take that to the bank!

351
00:35:43,453 --> 00:35:46,172
Hulland, plaster Storm's ass
with slime in the press.

352
00:35:46,453 --> 00:35:50,287
Make him responsible for that
hospital mess. Tail people he knows.

353
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:52,085
We know how to do our job.

354
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:55,928
Then show me. I'm starring in the
son of a bitch's home movies.

355
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:59,364
If that crap gets out,
I'm looking at 30 years.

356
00:36:49,093 --> 00:36:50,765
Geraldo.

357
00:36:51,573 --> 00:36:53,006
Who's this guy?

358
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:56,967
Our program came to an
unexpectedly violent conclusion.

359
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:16,569
Are you crazy?
I can't come in to work.

360
00:37:16,813 --> 00:37:19,566
I can't even go
to my apartment, Martha.

361
00:37:19,813 --> 00:37:21,531
People are dead.

362
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:22,968
Then where are you?

363
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:26,245
I can't tell you. Besides,
you're better off not knowing.

364
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:37,485
The people 's candidate, Senator
Vernon Trent, promises no new taxes.

365
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:40,373
And you can take that to the bank!

366
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,045
What'll I do with this guy?
I want to help him. . .

367
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:51,007
. . .but he's all over TV.
He's a crooked cop involved in--

368
00:37:54,493 --> 00:37:56,131
Why are you out of bed?

369
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:57,522
I've got you.

370
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:59,525
Police speculate that Storm...

371
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:03,772
... who is known to have ties
with criminal elements...

372
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:06,772
...could have involved
his contacts in his escape.

373
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:10,290
Storm was thought to have been
a murder victim. A casualty...

374
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:13,372
...of his own greed.
A widespread search is now being--

375
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:21,723
This is Mason Storm. I'd like
to speak with Jerry Dunphy.

376
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:26,648
No, it's not a joke.

377
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:32,684
We can't stay here.
They'll trace us from the hospital.

378
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:36,409
Nobody knows I'm here.
I'm housesitting.

379
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:39,452
It belongs to a friend of my parents.

380
00:38:39,773 --> 00:38:42,333
He's in China on research for 6 months.

381
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:45,767
The medical center
only has my apartment address.

382
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:48,925
Not even my friends have this number.

383
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:52,169
You've got to believe me.

384
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,563
You're safe here, okay?

385
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:01,492
This reporter was contacted personally
by the infamous "Coma Cop"...

386
00:39:01,733 --> 00:39:03,371
...fugitive officer Mason Storm...

387
00:39:03,613 --> 00:39:06,571
... who, until days ago,
had been in a 7-year coma.

388
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:11,404
Storm said he's innocent of charges
made against him in the press...

389
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:14,167
...and that he has
indisputable proof of this.

390
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:17,968
He has promised me a first look
at his alleged proof.

391
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:22,803
I want 24-hour surveillance
on that son of a bitch. . .

392
00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:25,362
. . .and those 2 nurses from the hospital.

393
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:37,602
No, I can do it myself.

394
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:39,605
You do it then.

395
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:50,965
You give me this beard?

396
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:02,442
You tried.

397
00:40:12,373 --> 00:40:15,570
-You ever been to Chinatown?
-Yeah. Why?

398
00:40:17,293 --> 00:40:21,571
This is a list of herbs and needles
that I need for my recovery.

399
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,083
Where did you learn to write Chinese?

400
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:30,363
When I was a kid, my dad was a
missionary. I was raised in the Orient.

401
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:32,884
As a young white boy over there. . .

402
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:36,563
. . .I needed to learn how to fight,
as you can imagine.

403
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:37,962
I remember. . .

404
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:41,172
. . .my first martial arts teacher
said to me:

405
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,803
"So why do you come to me?"

406
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:46,604
I say,
"To learn how to fight. "

407
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:49,566
And he says,
"So you want to hurt people.

408
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:53,172
But do you want to be great?"
I say, "Yeah.

409
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:55,964
I want to be great. "

410
00:40:56,613 --> 00:41:01,482
He says, "Then first learn how
to heal people to be great.

411
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,202
To hurt people is easy. "

412
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:27,087
Look at you!
You look great.

413
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:28,408
Like it?

414
00:41:40,773 --> 00:41:43,241
That's enough.
Why don't you go sit down?

415
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:54,366
That bad?

416
00:41:57,693 --> 00:42:00,571
If you need me,
I'll be in the outer room.

417
00:44:33,853 --> 00:44:35,889
O'Malley's the key.
We must find him.

418
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:40,211
You can't compare blood pressure
now with when you're in a coma.

419
00:44:40,413 --> 00:44:42,688
What's this?
555 over four digits.

420
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:44,884
That's crazy.
Let me see that.

421
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:48,930
Martha's chicken scratches.
She probably can't even read them.

422
00:44:49,173 --> 00:44:50,765
You know what it is?

423
00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:52,765
It's a phone number.

424
00:45:18,253 --> 00:45:22,565
When you phoned I asked
everyone here at the home. . .

425
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:27,165
. . .and there is no O'Malley here.
But it is possible. . .

426
00:45:27,653 --> 00:45:30,645
. . .O'Malley is a relation
of someone here.

427
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:36,048
Why not leave me your number and
I'll call you if there's any contact.

428
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:38,852
Can I phone you?

429
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:41,571
Of course, my dear.

430
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:45,771
-Here, let me do that.
-That's all right.

431
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:12,571
You old devil!

432
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:39,364
Mason Storm.

433
00:47:44,573 --> 00:47:46,450
Hi. I'm sorry.

434
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:49,848
I don't mean to interrupt.

435
00:47:50,973 --> 00:47:53,441
I was just passing by and I thought. . .

436
00:47:55,253 --> 00:47:57,005
. . .you might like a flower.

437
00:48:53,173 --> 00:48:54,925
I like that.

438
00:49:53,853 --> 00:49:56,526
Now I lay me down to sleep....

439
00:49:58,213 --> 00:50:00,363
Now we say it together, okay?

440
00:50:00,613 --> 00:50:03,286
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

441
00:50:03,773 --> 00:50:05,968
If I die before I wake...

442
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,926
...l pray the Lord my soul to take.

443
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:22,172
This is Martha Coe.
I can 't come to the phone--

444
00:50:22,373 --> 00:50:24,762
Pick up, Martha.
Please pick up!

445
00:50:26,213 --> 00:50:28,124
Are you there?
I'm coming over.

446
00:50:45,853 --> 00:50:47,923
Are you there?
I'm coming over.

447
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:50,365
You called it right, Axel.

448
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,925
Our girlfriend just showed up.

449
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,161
Martha, open up.
It's me.

450
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,406
What's up?

451
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:21,842
Looking for Martha?

452
00:51:22,373 --> 00:51:23,726
You know where she is?

453
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,369
You haven't seen the news?

454
00:51:29,733 --> 00:51:31,132
She's dead.

455
00:51:32,413 --> 00:51:34,973
She was strangled over in Westwood.

456
00:51:36,453 --> 00:51:37,363
Know something?

457
00:51:38,453 --> 00:51:40,808
You look like the bitch
whose picture's on TV.

458
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:46,168
The one whose house they found her at.

459
00:51:46,493 --> 00:51:48,768
Hey, get over here!

460
00:51:52,653 --> 00:51:54,371
Okay, boys, mount up.

461
00:52:12,973 --> 00:52:15,931
Ernie, you forgot my buttermilk!

462
00:52:16,253 --> 00:52:17,368
Shit!

463
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:46,566
O'Malley.

464
00:53:03,693 --> 00:53:05,604
That's Sonny, all right.

465
00:53:06,693 --> 00:53:08,092
The kid's a track star.

466
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:10,568
He does the hundred in 1 1 flat.

467
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:14,084
He's going to be real fast,
like his old man was.

468
00:53:14,373 --> 00:53:15,772
What do you mean "was"?

469
00:53:16,653 --> 00:53:18,371
I'm not over the hill.

470
00:53:19,013 --> 00:53:20,651
At least, I hope not.

471
00:53:22,053 --> 00:53:23,964
How'd you pull this off?

472
00:53:24,973 --> 00:53:27,328
He made it to my house
the night you were shot.

473
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:31,569
I got him hidden, played it out
like he was dead. . .

474
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:34,083
. . .staged his funeral
with yours and Felicia's.

475
00:53:34,573 --> 00:53:36,370
Everybody bought it.

476
00:53:39,293 --> 00:53:41,682
Where is he?
ls he safe?

477
00:53:42,173 --> 00:53:45,927
Ventura Trinity Prep School,
under my mother's maiden name, Wade.

478
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:49,127
No one has any idea that he's your son.

479
00:53:49,373 --> 00:53:51,443
So that was your mother that Andy found.

480
00:53:51,893 --> 00:53:56,205
Your nurse friend? Yeah.
She left a number and I traced you here.

481
00:54:02,013 --> 00:54:04,163
I don't know how to thank you.

482
00:54:04,733 --> 00:54:06,371
I have no words.

483
00:54:07,653 --> 00:54:10,167
Just seeing your ugly ass alive
is enough for me.

484
00:54:22,813 --> 00:54:24,769
That night in the hospital. . .

485
00:54:26,173 --> 00:54:28,562
. . .I found the audio tape in your vest.

486
00:54:29,373 --> 00:54:31,933
I must've played that tape 1 000 times. . .

487
00:54:32,213 --> 00:54:36,604
. . .Iooking for little quirks
in the voices, phrases that repeat.

488
00:54:36,893 --> 00:54:37,882
Nada.

489
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:39,646
Where is the tape?

490
00:54:39,893 --> 00:54:41,963
-I turned it in for evidence.
-What?

491
00:54:42,173 --> 00:54:43,572
Don't worry, I made a dupe.

492
00:54:43,893 --> 00:54:46,691
Meanwhile, I thought you'd
take some pleasure in this.

493
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:50,764
And there's more in the car.

494
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:53,969
You were not wrong, my friend.

495
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:56,965
You were not wrong.

496
00:55:05,373 --> 00:55:07,364
What's happened to you?

497
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:20,972
I was on the case
maybe a year and a half. . .

498
00:55:21,173 --> 00:55:23,562
. . .trying to find out
who pulled the trigger.

499
00:55:24,773 --> 00:55:26,809
But it was like swimming through shit.

500
00:55:27,013 --> 00:55:31,564
Everywhere I turned,
people told me to back off, get lost.

501
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:34,244
Then one morning the phone rings.

502
00:55:34,533 --> 00:55:36,444
Immaculate Heart Emergency.

503
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:39,963
Someone ran my mother off the road.

504
00:55:40,293 --> 00:55:42,966
Her back's broken.
She's paralyzed.

505
00:55:44,213 --> 00:55:46,363
I'm sorry, O'Mal.

506
00:55:48,493 --> 00:55:53,408
That night, there's a note in my locker
telling me it's no accident.

507
00:55:54,453 --> 00:55:56,045
What the hell could I do?

508
00:55:56,293 --> 00:56:00,172
I've got my hands tied behind
my back. I can't wave or salute.

509
00:56:01,293 --> 00:56:03,568
So I put my papers in.

510
00:56:04,613 --> 00:56:06,763
Took a 3/4 pension.

511
00:56:07,733 --> 00:56:10,167
You know me,
I never would have backed off.

512
00:56:10,693 --> 00:56:14,402
But there was Sonny to worry about.
What if they found him?

513
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:17,689
-Or you?
-No, you did the right thing.

514
00:56:17,893 --> 00:56:19,690
Then wasn't the time.

515
00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:21,252
Now's the time.

516
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:25,412
We're outgunned and undermanned,
but we're going to win.

517
00:56:25,693 --> 00:56:27,285
And I'll tell you why.

518
00:56:27,613 --> 00:56:31,128
Superior attitude,
superior state of mind.

519
00:56:34,773 --> 00:56:36,411
We'll get them, buddy.

520
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:38,172
Believe me.

521
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:48,330
Every fucking one of them.

522
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:10,411
One more favor:
Get Sonny out of that school now.

523
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:15,124
With me up and running, they'll
do anything to find Sonny to get to me.

524
00:57:15,373 --> 00:57:17,603
Get him someplace safe, anywhere.

525
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:19,451
Consider it done.

526
00:57:20,653 --> 00:57:22,644
I'm going straight to get that film.

527
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:25,208
As soon as you get that audio,
and Sonny's safe. . .

528
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:27,529
. . .we'll bring it in to Jerry Dunphy.

529
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:29,451
We'll see quite a show on the news.

530
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:31,971
You got it, partner.

531
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:43,408
I must've played that tape
1000 times...

532
00:57:43,613 --> 00:57:47,572
...looking for little quirks
in the voices, phrases that repeat.

533
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:51,689
Two guys I couldn 't make out,
but they'll come up on the film.

534
00:57:51,893 --> 00:57:54,532
-You can take that to the bank.
-I know that voice.

535
00:57:54,733 --> 00:57:59,329
Your charts go back 7 years. Do you
have any recollection of anything?

536
00:58:00,253 --> 00:58:04,690
I have them on the same film in
the same camera, right where I left it.

537
00:58:05,013 --> 00:58:09,370
The people 's candidate, Senator
Vernon Trent, promises no new taxes.

538
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,371
And you can take that to the bank.

539
00:58:14,893 --> 00:58:18,010
You can take that to the bank.

540
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:23,970
I'm going to take you to the bank,
Senator Trent.

541
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:26,165
To the blood bank.

542
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:01,766
Martha's dead.

543
00:59:05,893 --> 00:59:06,803
I'm sorry.

544
00:59:17,493 --> 00:59:19,165
It's all right.

545
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:21,969
O'Malley was here today.

546
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:26,170
He was?
How did he get here?

547
00:59:26,493 --> 00:59:29,963
You found him.
The old lady was his mother.

548
00:59:33,933 --> 00:59:35,969
My son's alive.

549
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:44,762
We better get out of here.
Really. Let's go.

550
00:59:46,813 --> 00:59:49,566
This ain't going to be
my best packing job.

551
01:00:04,693 --> 01:00:06,012
Where are we going?

552
01:00:06,293 --> 01:00:07,612
Out of here.

553
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:20,364
-Hurry up.
-I'm just about done.

554
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:24,449
Mason!

555
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:45,522
It's jammed!

556
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:05,722
Let's go.

557
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:21,002
Get down!

558
01:01:27,413 --> 01:01:28,812
Come quick.
Let's go!

559
01:01:51,053 --> 01:01:52,611
I'll slit your throat!

560
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:55,043
You're going to bleed like a pig!

561
01:01:55,573 --> 01:01:56,847
They're out back!

562
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,692
We're on them!

563
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:34,168
Hang on!

564
01:02:37,173 --> 01:02:39,243
Hulland!
You son of a bitch!

565
01:03:12,853 --> 01:03:15,242
I forgot to lock the door.

566
01:03:34,053 --> 01:03:35,884
You like my coche ?

567
01:03:37,733 --> 01:03:39,485
How hot is it, homes?

568
01:03:39,813 --> 01:03:41,087
Smoking.

569
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:45,481
You got it.

570
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:13,164
Maybe you should wear
these kind of clothes all the time.

571
01:04:13,373 --> 01:04:16,251
Only next time,
we'll use your credit card.

572
01:04:20,173 --> 01:04:21,925
Daddy, I don 't want you to go.

573
01:04:24,613 --> 01:04:28,447
You look really great for someone
who changed in a gas station.

574
01:04:29,773 --> 01:04:34,642
We're from Hillstar Real Estate.
We can market your home effectively.

575
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:37,731
We aren't even thinking about selling.

576
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:39,611
In fact, we're adding a nursery.

577
01:04:40,053 --> 01:04:41,327
It's a mess!

578
01:04:41,533 --> 01:04:44,172
-I'd love to see the nursery.
-Over here.

579
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:46,529
We don't know if it's a girl or a boy. . .

580
01:04:46,773 --> 01:04:48,570
. . .so we did a splatter effect.

581
01:04:59,013 --> 01:05:01,288
-What are you doing?
-Raiding the icebox.

582
01:05:13,773 --> 01:05:16,048
The plasterer might have fallen!

583
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:17,686
What about your baby?

584
01:05:22,213 --> 01:05:24,443
Just the way I left you.

585
01:05:29,413 --> 01:05:30,402
Good grief!

586
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:35,921
I'm sorry, but I think your
contractor's doing a lousy job.

587
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,851
These things happen.

588
01:05:47,613 --> 01:05:49,092
Thank God!

589
01:05:54,293 --> 01:05:55,521
Hang on, Mrs. O'Malley.

590
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:58,327
O'Malley left there
3 hours ago with the tape.

591
01:05:58,733 --> 01:06:00,405
It doesn't matter about the tape.

592
01:06:00,613 --> 01:06:03,411
We have to get this film
to Dunphy's studio. . .

593
01:06:03,653 --> 01:06:05,769
. . .before I have a nervous breakdown.

594
01:06:06,093 --> 01:06:07,811
Mrs. O'Malley, listen.

595
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,926
I'm across from the Bonaventure Hotel.

596
01:06:11,173 --> 01:06:13,289
I need you to do me a favor.

597
01:06:13,573 --> 01:06:17,771
Have O'Malley deliver a message
to the desk under Andrea Smith.

598
01:06:18,093 --> 01:06:20,607
No, we're not checking in.
That's too dangerous.

599
01:06:20,813 --> 01:06:24,647
But the desk will hold the message
if you tell them we're coming in later.

600
01:06:24,973 --> 01:06:26,531
All right? Thanks.

601
01:06:28,053 --> 01:06:29,611
Andrea. . .

602
01:06:30,893 --> 01:06:32,167
. . .Smith.

603
01:06:32,813 --> 01:06:35,088
Bonaventure Hotel. . .

604
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:38,331
. . .and leave a message. . .

605
01:06:38,573 --> 01:06:39,449
...at the desk.

606
01:06:39,653 --> 01:06:41,245
Baby, that's beautiful!

607
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:43,324
I love it.

608
01:07:03,213 --> 01:07:05,443
Where's my glove, Uncle Mal?

609
01:07:05,933 --> 01:07:08,766
Take it easy.
Sonny, hurry up, dear.

610
01:07:09,013 --> 01:07:11,243
Sonny, forget the mitt.
We got to get going.

611
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:14,843
The number for the
Bonaventure Hotel, please.

612
01:07:17,973 --> 01:07:19,452
When this is over. . .

613
01:07:19,693 --> 01:07:22,571
. . .you, me and your pop
will rent a boat. . .

614
01:07:22,893 --> 01:07:27,045
. . .and catch the biggest fish in the sea.
I'm not talking goldfish either.

615
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:30,052
The last time I went fishing with Pop. . .

616
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,131
. . .we caught an old tire.

617
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:36,246
Not this time, Sonny.
We'll get us a big, fat tuna.

618
01:07:36,933 --> 01:07:37,843
It's them.

619
01:07:38,093 --> 01:07:39,446
Let's go.

620
01:08:00,573 --> 01:08:02,006
Captain Hulland, L.A.P.D.

621
01:08:02,253 --> 01:08:06,690
I need to check any messages
for an Andrea Smith.

622
01:08:49,133 --> 01:08:53,046
Do you have any messages
for an Andrea Smith, please?

623
01:09:13,773 --> 01:09:15,968
Don't worry, Sonny's okay.

624
01:09:16,173 --> 01:09:20,132
He's with O'Malley, who has the tape.
They're headed for Union Station.

625
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:23,803
Great. Let's go get the car.
Just a minute.

626
01:09:44,693 --> 01:09:45,682
Cover me.

627
01:09:45,933 --> 01:09:47,366
Don't move!
You're surrounded.

628
01:10:01,453 --> 01:10:02,886
Send for backup!

629
01:10:07,253 --> 01:10:09,767
Hey! You can't do that in Dallas!

630
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,165
That's a rented car!

631
01:10:15,773 --> 01:10:17,172
Get the goddamn car.

632
01:10:17,453 --> 01:10:18,852
Get the car!

633
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:02,571
Your train's the Southwest Chief.

634
01:11:02,813 --> 01:11:05,247
It departs for Albuquerque at 1 1 : 1 0.

635
01:11:05,533 --> 01:11:07,251
Have a safe trip.

636
01:11:18,693 --> 01:11:20,524
My hands are shaking.

637
01:11:20,773 --> 01:11:22,445
Don't worry, kid.

638
01:11:23,213 --> 01:11:26,842
Even your old Uncle Mally's paws
wobble a bit from time to time.

639
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:28,243
Put this on.

640
01:11:28,453 --> 01:11:31,490
Watch out for the hot dog.
Don't spill mustard.

641
01:11:39,373 --> 01:11:42,649
I know it's hard to put together
after all these years.

642
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:47,572
I'm sorry I told you your dad
was dead. I thought it was best.

643
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,244
I know it's awkward.

644
01:11:50,893 --> 01:11:53,453
But your father loves you very much.

645
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:57,323
You've got to get to know each
other again. It'll take time.

646
01:11:57,533 --> 01:11:59,251
Now listen up.

647
01:12:00,053 --> 01:12:03,443
If your dad gets here on schedule,
you both get on the train.

648
01:12:03,693 --> 01:12:06,161
If he doesn't, you'll be going alone.

649
01:12:06,413 --> 01:12:09,450
One of us will be one step behind.
Don't worry.

650
01:12:13,533 --> 01:12:15,171
One step behind.

651
01:12:15,413 --> 01:12:18,769
Just like we planned in the car
on the way here.

652
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:23,601
O'Malley, long time no see!

653
01:12:24,853 --> 01:12:26,809
Make sure your father gets this.

654
01:12:32,133 --> 01:12:33,885
Are you taking a trip?

655
01:12:34,413 --> 01:12:38,611
Yeah, me and my kid are visiting
my mother in New Mexico.

656
01:12:40,253 --> 01:12:41,208
That's your son?

657
01:12:42,493 --> 01:12:44,927
Funny, he doesn't look much like you.

658
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:47,251
Does he, Quentero?

659
01:12:47,973 --> 01:12:49,406
As a matter of fact. . .

660
01:12:49,853 --> 01:12:52,447
. . .I think I've seen
his ugly face before.

661
01:12:52,693 --> 01:12:55,048
Kind of looks like Mason Storm.

662
01:12:59,213 --> 01:13:03,206
Enough of this fucking around.
We want the tape.

663
01:13:03,453 --> 01:13:04,408
Run, Sonny!

664
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:40,252
Take him!
We're going after the kid.

665
01:13:42,533 --> 01:13:44,683
I love you, Sonny.

666
01:13:45,733 --> 01:13:48,406
You fucks don't deserve your badges!

667
01:13:50,493 --> 01:13:53,053
Come here,
you little son of a bitch!

668
01:13:54,213 --> 01:13:56,169
-The kid's got the tape.
-Get his ass!

669
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,652
He's going in the alley!

670
01:14:15,573 --> 01:14:17,529
I'll call the police!

671
01:14:17,773 --> 01:14:19,126
Get out of the way!

672
01:14:22,533 --> 01:14:24,091
Help! Help!

673
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,488
This guy's crazy.
He broke my gate!

674
01:14:27,653 --> 01:14:28,881
Stop!

675
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:30,288
Please stop!

676
01:14:44,893 --> 01:14:46,565
My hand's bleeding bad.
Go ahead!

677
01:15:05,173 --> 01:15:06,925
Stop!
You little bastard!

678
01:15:20,493 --> 01:15:22,449
Come on, don't mess with me!

679
01:15:23,213 --> 01:15:25,090
You fuck! My leg!

680
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:29,885
Come here or I'll kill you!

681
01:15:37,253 --> 01:15:38,652
I broke my fucking leg!

682
01:15:59,613 --> 01:16:01,171
Coma Cop, let's see what you got.

683
01:16:58,053 --> 01:17:00,203
-Take care of him.
-Where are you going?

684
01:17:00,453 --> 01:17:03,251
One more take-out order.
You're safe with her.

685
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:04,642
You're okay with me.

686
01:17:17,053 --> 01:17:18,168
Who are you?

687
01:17:18,813 --> 01:17:20,963
It's a very long story.

688
01:17:21,253 --> 01:17:22,845
You got a few minutes?

689
01:18:00,853 --> 01:18:02,047
Senator!

690
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:08,330
I know it's a bad time,
but things have happened--

691
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:11,366
I want Quentero and the others here now.

692
01:18:11,613 --> 01:18:13,843
Storm is just nuts enough
to come after me.

693
01:18:14,053 --> 01:18:15,964
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

694
01:18:16,373 --> 01:18:19,251
Can we have a little privacy, please?

695
01:18:20,253 --> 01:18:22,244
I'll be downstairs.

696
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:28,442
We're not going to make the
ballet tonight. Take a hike.

697
01:18:28,693 --> 01:18:29,887
Get lost!

698
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,643
I'll show you guys how to break.

699
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,844
How's the action, boys?

700
01:19:30,093 --> 01:19:31,242
Mind if I play?

701
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:38,491
I know you're thinking, if I have
this in my hand, I can't play.

702
01:19:39,133 --> 01:19:40,327
How's this?

703
01:19:40,573 --> 01:19:42,245
I'll put it away.

704
01:19:49,013 --> 01:19:51,322
Well? Somebody hand me a cue.

705
01:20:12,493 --> 01:20:13,289
Impressive.

706
01:20:16,293 --> 01:20:18,249
That's for my wife.
Fuck you and die!

707
01:21:14,773 --> 01:21:15,808
Son of a bitch!

708
01:21:30,413 --> 01:21:33,211
How does it feel to know
you're about to die?

709
01:21:37,373 --> 01:21:42,208
I'll give you more time
than you gave my wife and son.

710
01:22:00,133 --> 01:22:01,452
I got to tell you!

711
01:22:01,653 --> 01:22:03,723
You can't do this!
It wasn't me!

712
01:22:10,013 --> 01:22:12,004
Now you're a good cop.

713
01:22:22,373 --> 01:22:23,567
Vernon?

714
01:22:27,293 --> 01:22:29,409
Let's try in here.

715
01:22:43,453 --> 01:22:46,013
Maybe you're behind this painting.

716
01:22:47,053 --> 01:22:50,011
No. You're so good at this, Vernon.

717
01:22:50,573 --> 01:22:53,007
Maybe you're under the bed.

718
01:22:54,173 --> 01:22:56,641
No, not under the bed.

719
01:23:01,373 --> 01:23:03,603
What about in here?

720
01:23:12,133 --> 01:23:14,408
Vernon, where are you?

721
01:23:36,813 --> 01:23:38,804
How do you like this, Vernon?

722
01:23:39,053 --> 01:23:42,409
I'd like to kill you so bad,
I can barely contain myself.

723
01:23:42,653 --> 01:23:44,006
But I've been thinking.

724
01:23:44,253 --> 01:23:47,211
Death is far too merciful
a fate for you.

725
01:23:47,453 --> 01:23:49,330
So what I'm going to do is. . .

726
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:52,485
. . .put you in prison.

727
01:23:52,693 --> 01:23:56,527
A nice petite white boy like you
in a federal penitentiary. . . .

728
01:23:56,813 --> 01:24:01,728
Let me put it this way: You won't be
able to stay anal-retentive very long.

729
01:24:02,453 --> 01:24:04,683
I'm going to take
these handcuffs here. . .

730
01:24:05,133 --> 01:24:09,411
. . .then I'll arrest you and
I'll take you in. How's that?

731
01:24:21,173 --> 01:24:22,003
Freeze!

732
01:24:22,493 --> 01:24:24,802
Drop the gun! Slowly!

733
01:24:25,213 --> 01:24:27,568
Get on your knees,
with your hands in the air.

734
01:24:27,773 --> 01:24:29,843
Thank God!
Thank God you guys are here!

735
01:24:30,293 --> 01:24:31,806
Do it now!

736
01:24:34,413 --> 01:24:35,766
You got to stop him.

737
01:24:40,573 --> 01:24:42,404
Let me go! Storm, no!

738
01:24:46,933 --> 01:24:48,924
Storm, no!
Hold it right there.

739
01:24:49,813 --> 01:24:52,566
Sergeant, talk to him.
Tell him to let me go.

740
01:24:57,573 --> 01:24:59,052
Give me the gun.

741
01:25:03,653 --> 01:25:05,211
Give me the gun.

742
01:25:11,933 --> 01:25:13,605
We saw the film.

743
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:16,051
We know you were set up.

744
01:25:17,173 --> 01:25:19,209
Senator, you're under arrest.

745
01:25:20,613 --> 01:25:21,728
Cuff him.

746
01:25:23,933 --> 01:25:26,003
What the hell are you talking about?

747
01:25:26,373 --> 01:25:29,410
What are you talking about?
You can't do this to me!

748
01:25:29,853 --> 01:25:33,607
I'm a senator, for Christ's sake!
You can't do this to me!

749
01:25:39,173 --> 01:25:40,572
We're sorry, Storm.

750
01:25:43,293 --> 01:25:44,806
You're a dead man, Storm!

751
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:53,043
-Are you all right?
-I love you, Storm.

752
01:25:55,013 --> 01:25:56,492
I'm the Senator!

753
01:25:56,893 --> 01:25:59,088
How about a nice vacation?

754
01:26:08,853 --> 01:26:10,809
This guy is going to be famous.

755
01:26:11,133 --> 01:26:14,603
I can hear tomorrow's weather report.
"Killer Storm strikes back. "

756
01:26:14,853 --> 01:26:18,766
It shows Senator Trent making a deal
with his underworld cronies.

757
01:26:19,013 --> 01:26:21,846
You'll be very well
compensated, Mr. Calabrese.

758
01:26:22,293 --> 01:26:24,887
Money now, and lots more
when I get in that office.

759
01:26:25,133 --> 01:26:27,408
And you can take that to the bank.

760
01:26:30,613 --> 01:26:33,366
We have the greatest respect
for Storm 's courage.

761
01:26:33,613 --> 01:26:37,367
You told me this dock was clean.
What the hell's going on here?

762
01:26:37,573 --> 01:26:40,087
Are you people listening to me?

763
01:29:02,053 --> 01:29:04,044
