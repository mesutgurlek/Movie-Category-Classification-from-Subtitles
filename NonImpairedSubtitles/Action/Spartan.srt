1
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,066
You had your whole life
to prepare for this moment.

2
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,639
Why aren't you ready?

3
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,970
I'm tired, sir.

4
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,475
Do you wish to quit?

5
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:02,287
If your mission is to quit,
there's no better time than right now.

6
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,946
You can quit now, get it over with.

7
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,089
I can't catch her.

8
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,694
I understand.

9
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,593
Just take those numbers off
and put them in my hand.

10
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,601
Forget that!

11
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,447
You better catch her.

12
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,642
- Well done.
- Sir.

13
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,173
You looked back for my sign.
Well done.

14
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,081
- I don't even know why I did it.
- Yeah, well...

15
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,654
...you know what Napoleon said:

16
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,155
- "Give me a man who's lucky."
- Yes, sir.

17
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:19,162
- What they got you teaching, sergeant?
- Edged weapons, sir. Knife fighting.

18
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,326
Don't you teach them knife fighting.
Teach them to kill.

19
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,437
That way they meet some son of a bitch
studied knife fighting...

20
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,630
...they send his soul to hell.

21
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,908
It's all in the mind, sergeant.
That's where the battle's won.

22
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:37,011
Mr. Scott.
Black, Jacqueline A., U.s. 24341924.

23
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,550
I hope you'll remember and reach out
for me, if you could use me.

24
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,085
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

25
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,583
Thank you.

26
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,398
You guys cleaned up good.

27
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,671
- It's good to see you.
- What's happening, brother?

28
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,901
You ain't looking too bad
yourself there, big boy.

29
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,705
In one piece.

30
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,719
Hey, check it out.

31
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,790
I see you.

32
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,924
Talk to me.

33
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,900
How you doing, sir?

34
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,669
What's that then?

35
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,364
This was my father's.

36
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,068
- He carry it over there?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,675
- He come back?
- Yes, sir, he did.

38
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,574
You carry it then.

39
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,777
Maybe it'll save your life.

40
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,816
Light a fire with it or something.

41
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,049
Hey, Bobby! Bobby.

42
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,288
- Yeah, give me that.
- Thanks.

43
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,954
Sir.

44
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,736
- I would like to say, to meet you...
- You haven't met me.

45
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,133
You've been up for a week.
You been seeing snakes.

46
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,969
Fall out of the bleachers!
Grab your bags.

47
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,704
All you men are returning to unit.
Let's go.

48
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,841
Have your number in your right hand.

49
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:23,148
- Can't imagine how they live with it.
- Your number in your right hand.

50
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,191
Can't you?
I thought I saw you considering it.

51
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,693
- What the hell is that?
- That's a wedding ring, sir.

52
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,524
You hear that?

53
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,433
The sentry you're sneaking up on,
he can hear it too.

54
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,536
You've been around long enough
to know that.

55
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,141
- Thank you, sir. My name's curtis...
- Do I need to know?

56
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,503
If I want camaraderie,
I'll join the Masons.

57
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,508
There's just the mission.

58
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,782
- He got the letter from his wife.
- Yeah? How's she doing?

59
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,445
Sir.

60
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:02,224
- Orders up! Get your eyes in the boat!
- All right, I want your numbers.

61
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,625
- Get these fucking numbers off.
- You heard him.

62
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:08,699
You don't need them no more.
Come on, now. You think I have all night?

63
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,065
I've got two things for you boys.
That's a stiff dick and bubble gum.

64
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,002
And guess what,
I'm out of bubble gum.

65
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:19,270
Are you deaf or are you just trying
to try my patience? Get those numbers off!

66
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,935
Let's go.

67
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,177
Number nine and number 12.
Who the fuck is that? Stand up, now!

68
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,446
You two are the first two.
On me.

69
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,747
Pick it up, people. I don't have all night.

70
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,359
- Yes, sir!
- Thanks for coming down, master gunner.

71
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,621
Sure thing, boss.

72
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,982
Here you go, sir.

73
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,886
- Grossler?
- Yes, sir.

74
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,050
- Curtis.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,731
This is the final selection event.

76
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,964
Follow my instructions.
Nothing more, nothing less.

77
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,271
On my command, execute.
The last man standing, walk out that door.

78
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,346
You will be admitted to the unit.

79
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,754
Execute.

80
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,788
- It's not current.
- Why not?

81
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,488
It seems she got a makeover today.
We're working on it.

82
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,789
- Four p.m., cut n' curl?
- They gave her a crew cut, dyed it blond.

83
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,364
- Any idea why?
- Nope.

84
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,433
And then met with the boyfriend at 9.

85
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,899
- Then?
- We don't know.

86
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,005
But your man was on post
till he turned her over to night watch.

87
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,970
- He says he was.
- What else you got?

88
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,269
I gotta get you on a landline.
We got the boyfriend, Michael Blake.

89
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,276
- Where is he?
- We're shaking the trees.

90
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,247
And Professor Gerald sloane,
notably chummy with his female students...

91
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,113
...of which she was one.
Weekend home, Martha's vineyard.

92
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,155
I'm light. I'm light, people.
I need another team on the professor.

93
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,760
- I need an over-watch on the boyfriend.
- Is the phone up? Get the phone up.

94
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,418
Got it. We're up!

95
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,325
- You just come from cadre?
- Yes, sir.

96
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,490
- How long since you've slept?
- Not significant.

97
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,899
I don't have the bodies.
Call them in. Call them in.

98
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,308
His post was Harvard Yard.

99
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:49,444
Harvard Yard, northeast corner,
Lowell House, across from her dorm.

100
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,311
Night watch relieved him there, midnight.

101
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,484
Want to help me out?

102
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,248
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

103
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,724
- I'm making myself clear to you, right?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,092
Okay, then. Once again.

105
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,495
She had lunch with her father.

106
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,898
Lunch with her father.
You were seconded to that?

107
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,538
- No, sir, I just had her.
- You just had her?

108
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,873
I had her all day.
Tucked her in at 1 o. And she...

109
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,742
Yeah, she had a tiff with her boyfriend,
Michael Blake.

110
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:26,078
- What was it about?
- I think it was about her...

111
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:31,588
- Her haircut. So it wasn't a serious...?
- No, no. No.

112
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:36,825
- And then I held the post until relieved.
- Well, then we've got a little problem.

113
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,588
I was there.

114
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:43,258
2312 hours, 19 May, Harvard Yard,
northeast corner, Lowell House...

115
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,734
...reveals no secret service presence.

116
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:50,736
Neither his post, nor adjacent.
A second tour, 233o, reveals similarly.

117
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,401
- I was there, sir.
- Who's lying, you or him?

118
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,309
You son of a bitch, I got 15 years in.
I got two kids.

119
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,882
You're not gonna sit there
and lie away my pension.

120
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,417
- I was...
- Do not say you were there.

121
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,350
I was on post.

122
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:07,083
Get up, motherfucker!
Don't you say you were on post!

123
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,523
Get up! You son of a bitch!

124
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,563
- Get up! You motherfucker!
- Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!

125
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,336
Okay, sit down.

126
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,106
Shall I tell you what's gonna happen
to you when we find you out?

127
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,547
Were you fucking her?

128
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,809
- We're gonna find out.
- No, l...

129
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,715
where is the girl?
Where is your principal?

130
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,888
We're gonna have to take this
from the top again.

131
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,720
- Okay, Mr. Gaines?
- Yes, sir.

132
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,294
I want the clock up.
Let's get the clock up, please.

133
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:48,194
We got until her Monday-morning class,
then it's Meet the Press and "where is she?"

134
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,460
The professor.
Who's got the professor?

135
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,103
- Where is he?
- Martha's vineyard.

136
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,795
- Who's got him?
- Parr and shannon.

137
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,464
Wake him up, shake him up.
He don't wanna talk...

138
00:12:56,642 --> 00:13:00,442
...here's what we have him doing with his
female students. Show them to his wife.

139
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,980
- We got the state cops on the scrambler.
- The photo.

140
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,019
This is the last known photo of the girl.

141
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,854
Sir!

142
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,183
It's the professor.

143
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,386
- You had him at his home.
- We were in error.

144
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,724
- Where is he?
- Best guess puts him on his boat.

145
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,732
Last seen, west Tisbury,
Martha's vineyard.

146
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,961
- Show me.
- Right here.

147
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,197
Find him. Put the guard on him.
Get me an overflight.

148
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,205
- I hear you.
- I'm 25 men light here.

149
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,674
- Who's got the coast Guard?
- I got them.

150
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,939
I need an overflight.
Coast Guard search and Rescue.

151
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,549
Coast Guard on the red phone.
New Bedford!

152
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:42,915
- What's the name of his boat?
- The Colophon, out of west Tisbury.

153
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,578
Sir.

154
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,455
- It's the boyfriend. He's moving.
- I need a stalker on the boyfriend. Now.

155
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,859
- I've got him.
- Call it out. Hold surveillance.

156
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,468
I've got two days to run in
before the press wakes up.

157
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:57,897
Yes, sir.

158
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,662
Let me see your hands, son.

159
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,766
Right now.

160
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,637
Drop it.

161
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,442
Did you lose your mailbox key, son?

162
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,073
- You a student here?
- Yes.

163
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,378
Can I see some identification, please?

164
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,818
- Section 12, this is...
- No, please. Please.

165
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,049
Calm down.
It's gonna be what it's gonna be.

166
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,820
Can I talk to you for one minute?
Just one minute, all right?

167
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,692
This... It's not what it looks like.

168
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,562
I broke up with my girlfriend.
This is her mailbox. It's Laura.

169
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,361
- Laura Newton.
- Laura?

170
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,800
- Yes.
- Newton?

171
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,372
The Laura Newton?

172
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,442
That's right. We broke up.

173
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,671
- They know who I am.
- They?

174
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,373
- The secret service.
- Secret service?

175
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,983
That's right.

176
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,087
They know who I am.
They cleared me.

177
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,280
They didn't clear you for this.
Let's go.

178
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,448
- Okay...
- Let's go.

179
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:31,153
- I was just trying to retrieve the letter.
- This is not very nice language.

180
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,730
"You deserve everything
that's gonna happen to you."

181
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,891
What's gonna happen to her?
Did you hurt her?

182
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,764
Did you hit her?

183
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,633
Hit her? No.

184
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,975
- I called her a whore.
- What's this sign?

185
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,111
What does this sign mean?

186
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,007
Right here.

187
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,777
She signs all of her letters with that.
It's because she...

188
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,249
...sees things cockeyed, like Picasso.
- Picasso.

189
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,320
She says they call her Picasso.

190
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,252
Why did you fight with her, son?

191
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,521
She got her hair done.
Dyed it blond. She cut it off.

192
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,186
I called her a slut.

193
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,231
Wait. We've all seen the pictures.
Beautiful young girl like that...

194
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,493
...what do you care what color
she dyes her hair?

195
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,467
Now why does that make her a slut?

196
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,103
She's fucking another guy.

197
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,303
You want to talk about it?

198
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,840
If you want to talk about it,
I will give you one minute.

199
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,687
Nothing hurts worse than that,
if she's sleeping with another guy.

200
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,457
There's this...

201
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,788
This teacher that...

202
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,524
I shouldn't be telling you this.

203
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,465
She's sleeping with a teacher?

204
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,499
Well, she says she isn't.

205
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,540
I said if she wants to fuck old men, she
should go to the Back Light, go all the way.

206
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:56,272
- Back Light?
- Yeah. It's this club by the Fenway.

207
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,882
It's like a joke at school, like a rumor.

208
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,952
This girl or that girl went with
a businessman for one night...

209
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,486
...made a thousand bucks.

210
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,220
This is a lovers' quarrel, all right?

211
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,261
I said something that I regret.
I sent a note that I regret.

212
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,391
I can assure you, officer...

213
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,659
...if you see your way clear
to give me a break, it'll never...

214
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,100
The Back Light.
It's a club in the Fenway.

215
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,101
A club in the Fenway.

216
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,511
No morgue. No hospital. No note.

217
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,908
The parents?

218
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:34,678
The mother, you know where she is.
She's a drunk. He's holding up.

219
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,378
- He was in town yesterday to see her.
- He was?

220
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,081
- We snuck him in and out.
- How long were they together?

221
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,284
- Parker.
- One second.

222
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,886
- He copped to it.
- Copped to what?

223
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,967
Left his post. Punched out early
to go boffing his girlfriend.

224
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,700
Hope she was worth it.

225
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,166
- Sir.
- All right. Let's get back on it.

226
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:02,210
Okay. Back Light.
A restaurant, The Black Night...

227
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,645
...The Black Light, a bar,
a supper club.

228
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,614
Black Light, that's it.

229
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,609
Put up the graphics on the girl.
Take a look at this.

230
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:43,050
We ran it up from a description
of the colorist from the beauty parlor.

231
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,053
Show him what we got.

232
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,024
Transport is under command of state.

233
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,628
We refer to section two.
Yeah, I understand.

234
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,425
- May I have your jacket?
- Right, I got it.

235
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,828
Yeah.

236
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,265
Get their guys off the perimeter.
Get our guys in.

237
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,665
I need $5ooo.

238
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,932
- Annie.
- I heard it, $5ooo.

239
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,704
- Scraping the bottom of the barrel, huh?
- Yes, sir.

240
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,041
Five thousand dollars.
Need you to sign for it.

241
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,807
You sign for it.

242
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,576
All right.

243
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,317
- What happened to your wedding ring?
- I took it off.

244
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,151
Did you go off your wife?

245
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,122
No, sir, I'm working.

246
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,229
Keep your mouth shut, your eyes open.
And form on me.

247
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,713
Move aside. Move aside!

248
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,145
Oh, Jesus.

249
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,754
All right, then. Who saw it?

250
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:56,216
I believe he had a hideout piece.
Who frisked him?

251
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,692
Who frisked the son of a bitch?

252
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,931
The girl he went to see, get her in.
The one he was fucking.

253
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,537
- Two guys to her house, right now.
- Seal the room off.

254
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,174
Check out the file.

255
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,872
Seal the room off.

256
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,037
He was off post when
he snatched the girl?

257
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,048
Yeah, well, apparently he felt bad
about it.

258
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,750
- Show me a set of keys.
- I ain't got them.

259
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,059
Here, you take the chain.

260
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,298
You've got the over-watch.

261
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,031
Swing the chain.
You're a guy walking the dog.

262
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,270
Loosen your collar.

263
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,623
Told me 2:oo.

264
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,154
It's closing time, gents.
Time to pack it up.

265
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,230
Don't gotta go home,
but you can't stay here.

266
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,839
Closing up.
Can't sell booze after 2 a.m.

267
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,966
No, I just wanted to pay you
that money I owe you.

268
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,811
- How about them sox, huh?
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?

269
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,974
Yeah. "curse of the Bambino,"
isn't that what you call it?

270
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,177
That's right. Where are you from?

271
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,790
Yeah, well, actually,
I was just trying to find my niece.

272
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,926
Oh, that's what you're looking for?

273
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,927
Because a lot of guys come in here
looking for someone else's niece.

274
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,361
No. Girl like that...

275
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,125
...been in tonight?

276
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,796
- Pretty girl.
- Yeah, that's my type.

277
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,337
Girl like that been in?

278
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,372
You sure you're looking
for your niece?

279
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:55,707
Because a lot of guys come in here and
go home with some rather younger girl.

280
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,940
No, no. Why...?
Why would...

281
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,108
...a younger girl like that
want to be with a guy like me?

282
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,168
Howdy, pard.

283
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,403
I was wondering
if I could ask you a favor.

284
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,478
I love you, baby,
but the season's over.

285
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,707
Your friend said you
were sort of a matchmaker.

286
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,681
Look, you can't believe
everything you hear.

287
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,493
- Catch you later.
- You know it.

288
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,391
Okay, lock it up.

289
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,998
Drive safely, now.

290
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,641
- Yeah?
- I was looking for a girl.

291
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,401
For a young girl.

292
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,075
Well, aren't we all?

293
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:05,046
My question was, why would
a young, pretty girl like that...

294
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,653
...go out with a guy like me?
And if you could answer that...

295
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,287
Look, bub...

296
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,409
what is this?

297
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,308
What's this? It's Rohypnol, is it?

298
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:43,420
Is this Ro? Is this Roofy? Is this a
one-sided conversation? What's his name?

299
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,523
- Jerry Zimmer.
- Jerry. Jerry.

300
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,156
Where's the girl?
Where's the girl, Jerry?

301
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,354
- Jerry, where's the girl?
- What girl?

302
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,566
Dose her? You dose her, Jerry?

303
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,964
- Hey.
- What?

304
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,901
- About 1 o, 15 thou.
- What's that for?

305
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,478
- I think you broke my arm!
- Where's the girl?

306
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,841
I think you broke my arm!

307
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,042
Now it's broken.

308
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,187
Where is the girl, Jerry?

309
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,513
I never saw that girl.

310
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,262
Where's the girl?
Where did you take her?

311
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,992
Where did you take this girl, Jerry?

312
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,002
That's not the girl.

313
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,974
Where did you take this girl, Jerry?

314
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,637
Take your knife out.

315
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,239
Where did you take the girl, Jerry?

316
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,948
Take his eye out.

317
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,682
You bet your life.

318
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,053
Wait! Wait! Wait!

319
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,259
I took the girl.

320
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,861
I took the girl to...

321
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,334
Three units remain on the perimeter
until further instructions.

322
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,562
The sniper is to stand down.

323
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,107
Plainclothes, transport in the south alley.

324
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,976
I got it.

325
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,676
- Is that right?
- Yes.

326
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:22,479
We run an escort service. There is no
impropriety here. There is no illegality.

327
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,554
- Who is she?
- Nadya Tellich.

328
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,987
Serb. Green card,
five years ago.

329
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,718
They sign a contract
with us for personal services...

330
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,194
...and they pay us so much
for each call, and the girls pay us.

331
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,357
- They show you proof of their age?
- Of course. What do you think?

332
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,833
- Have you seen this girl?
- I have not.

333
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,767
Here's the first one.

334
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,502
Was this girl here?

335
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,404
She's new.
This is her first night.

336
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,137
How about that?
Put some fucking clothes on.

337
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,045
I want my lawyer.

338
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,740
You don't need one.
We need the girl. Give us the girl.

339
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,943
This girl was not here.

340
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,748
I'm entitled to my lawyer.

341
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,380
You're entitled to shit.
You're entitled to tell me what you know.

342
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,857
If the girl was here...

343
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,395
...if you cooperate,
I'll see what I can do.

344
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:10,467
I think I can help you,
if you tell me now.

345
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,536
Why would I not tell you
if the girl was here?

346
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,130
The girl is new.

347
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,141
They told us
that it was her first night.

348
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,440
But look here.

349
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,246
There's two pinholes in the photo.

350
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,051
They moved it over.

351
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,091
Photo's missing.

352
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,035
Where is she?

353
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,508
- I don't want to get in trouble.
- You don't know what trouble is.

354
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,802
I'm not even sure that was her.

355
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,674
She was sick.
She was not very well.

356
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,145
- She came in here and...
- she came here?

357
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:02,082
They took her. I told Nadya
she shouldn't be here. They took her.

358
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,016
Who is "they"?

359
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,020
They took her?

360
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,818
Where did they take her?

361
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,821
Honey, you got all the slack
in the world until I leave this room.

362
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,628
And then I'm going to zero you out.

363
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,570
Two men.

364
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,534
They gave her a shot.

365
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,535
I think that was her.

366
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,006
- Where is she?
- I'm entitled to my rights.

367
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,650
- I'm entitled to my phone call.
- You don't understand.

368
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,049
You'll leave your life, or you'll
leave the information in this room.

369
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,747
Where is the girl?

370
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,290
They'll kill me.

371
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:43,755
Who did you call?

372
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,919
How did you know
to come pick her up?

373
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,258
How did they know to get her?
Who did you call?

374
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,060
It's just a number...

375
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,027
write it down.

376
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,662
Write it down. I'm gonna see what I can do.
Just give me the number.

377
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,674
I don't understand.
She's just some girl.

378
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,402
Oh, my God.

379
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,809
They don't know who they've got.

380
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,375
Sir.

381
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,166
Where's the girl?

382
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,529
Sir, we believe she was
abducted from this club.

383
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,035
That she was taken to...

384
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,503
That she was taken to a bordello.

385
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,302
- Here in Boston?
- Yes, sir, and that... That...

386
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,037
- Let's hear it.
- She may have been delivered for sale.

387
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,340
May have been sent down
the pipeline, overseas.

388
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,278
- To get to her father?
- No, sir.

389
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,248
We believe they don't
know who she is...

390
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,852
...that they just took some girl.

391
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,545
- Just some girl.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,749
How certain are you she was
the girl in the whorehouse?

393
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,019
- We...
- she dyed her hair.

394
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,425
They see that red hair...

395
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,760
what do they do, her hair grows out,
when they see that red hair...

396
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,232
...somebody recognizes her?

397
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,598
What do they do when
they realize who they took?

398
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,262
They kill her.

399
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,498
You're fucking-A right, they kill her.
Okay.

400
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,167
Now, let's talk some common sense.

401
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,812
Who is he?

402
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,451
What can you do for me?

403
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,449
What can you do for me?
I need it now.

404
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,954
I need it before the press gets it on
Monday, because they will kill her.

405
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:24,186
The press gets this, the jackals start
a feeding frenzy, and she's dead. Help me.

406
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,990
This is the number of a public phone
in downtown Boston.

407
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,633
It's a cutout between
the bordello and the abductors.

408
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,962
A call is placed when they
have a package.

409
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,537
- Stake out the phone.
- We have a watch on the phone.

410
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:38,335
But more importantly, NsA reports
calls placed to that phone regularly.

411
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,569
- They can track calls to the pay phone?
- Yes.

412
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,077
- How?
- They were made from a federal prison.

413
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,647
This is Tariq Asani.

414
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,614
He's a Lebanese national
serving life without for kidnapping.

415
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,949
He's the second man
in a sex-slavery scheme.

416
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,853
And where is he?

417
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,358
He's in Florence Federal Penitentiary.
He placed the calls to the pay phone.

418
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,163
- We have a plan. I hesitate to...
- Give it to me.

419
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,232
Got some action on the pay phone.

420
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,876
Who's walking up on us?

421
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,683
He's Boston P.D.

422
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,946
In the city, always a reflection.
In the woods, always a sound.

423
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,612
What about the desert?

424
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,020
You don't want to go in the desert.

425
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,907
Let's go. Let's go.
We're moving.

426
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,429
- Where's he going?
- Hold on. Hold on.

427
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:12,025
One-five-four-nine Alpha-sierra,
Mass. Registration, william Barak.

428
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,933
- Somerville, Mass.
- Is that where he's going?

429
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,734
Owner of record in Essex.

430
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,639
Is he heading toward Essex?
What kind of place would it be?

431
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,279
Lt'd be a beach house.

432
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,778
Get me there.

433
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,848
Get it on the Net.
Everyone off.

434
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,281
Call everyone off. Just me.
Just me and him.

435
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,110
Indicate you heard me.

436
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,847
State Police, standing by.

437
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,721
Turn off the white car.
Turn off the white car.

438
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,887
The shooters are going to the beach.
Team of two going to Essex.

439
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,353
Confirm, assault team of two
to the beach.

440
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:08,049
- Withdraw and hold at condition two.
- State Police, request verify.

441
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,251
We believe the hostage is...

442
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,658
Six-five and Mobile 4 are RTB.
Acknowledge.

443
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,627
Stand down and squawk on your A vX.

444
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,858
Get me there.

445
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,849
If the girl's in the house,
I'm taking her out.

446
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:13,115
If it ain't me or her, kill it.

447
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,258
Clear.

448
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:13,173
Well, I hope you both feel better
in the morning. Good night.

449
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,874
- Yes?
- Does an Alan Palmer live here?

450
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,816
- Yes, my husband's at work.
- This is just a routine check, Mrs. Palmer.

451
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,865
We have a license-plate number,
but we're not sure of the accuracy.

452
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,697
May I come in?

453
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:49,504
- What the fuck?
- I heard the Tv, so I came in.

454
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,450
Why the hell do you got the Tv on?
There's no one here.

455
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,846
I don't want to hurt you.
I just want to know why the Tv's on.

456
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,819
I just came to...
That's what I want to know.

457
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:06,961
I'm telling you why I came in.
What do you make of that?

458
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:11,864
That's the thing. This time of the night...
Do you hear what I'm telling you?

459
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,911
- Question.

460
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,649
Even it up. Where's the girl?
Where is the girl?

461
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,445
It's not too late.
Look at me. Look at me.

462
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,918
Where is the girl?

463
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,050
Where is she?

464
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,291
It's curtis. I'm coming in.

465
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,782
Abort. Abort. Abort.

466
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,394
Cold LZ. Cold hole.

467
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,757
Stand by. Await instructions.

468
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,600
She sets the styles.
She brings us smiles.

469
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,709
She's Betty Coed in college
and she's in the news again.

470
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,402
- Shit.
- She had her hair restyled, cut and dyed.

471
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,014
- We caught up with her stylist...
- Turn it off.

472
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:08,709
...and have reconstructed that new look.
And you're looking at it.

473
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:14,957
I'm out of time.

474
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,499
Keep it locked up.

475
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,966
What about if we had to go
off the meter?

476
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,639
I need a man, a man who can
unquestioningly follow orders.

477
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,445
The door is closed, sir.

478
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,021
I need to ask you to do something.

479
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,886
I am here to get the girl back, sir.

480
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,658
And there is nothing I will not do...

481
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,191
...to get the girl back.

482
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,500
This man...

483
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,535
...placed a phone call yesterday...

484
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,766
...from the phone bank at Florence
to the copley pay phone.

485
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,070
Here's the cutoff point. Here it is.

486
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,806
This man, Tariq Asani,
is to be transported tomorrow...

487
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:15,315
...with another convict,
a man on death row.

488
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,147
A man on death row...

489
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,085
...for their medical procedures.

490
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,557
I'll take you step by step through what
we've envisioned is gonna happen.

491
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:40,570
Dispatch acknowledges Florence Unit 5
is Code 7 at Highway 15.

492
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,814
You fellas all right?

493
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:00,255
Hey, help me. Help me, man.
Buck me up, man.

494
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,450
- Hey, I need some help.
- Yeah, I'll help you out. Get out.

495
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,323
Me and my brother need
some shit right here.

496
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,557
- You marked him paid in full.
- Yeah, that's what I did.

497
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,223
Hey, give me a cigarette, man.

498
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,393
Wait over there. I'll be right back.

499
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,266
Yeah, but break me out of this.

500
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,340
Hey, yo, just throw me the keys,
and I'll do it.

501
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,500
I gotta do some cleaning first.

502
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:10,443
Motherfuckers want to hook me up
to some injection machine, man.

503
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:14,483
Motherfuckers want to take my life
who just got well here, you know?

504
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,558
Who just got well.

505
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:23,696
Then the hand of God came down with
an outstretched arm and freed my ass.

506
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,334
You know?

507
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,732
Hey, baby, pass me some my way,
you know?

508
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,663
Sorry, my man. Traveling light.

509
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,244
No, wait. Wait. Don't shoot me.
Don't shoot me.

510
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:42,181
I can get us out of the country tonight.
Oh, God, please don't shoot me! No!

511
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,913
I swear on my mother.
Look at me. Please.

512
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,420
No.

513
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,856
I swear to you. A seaplane, tonight.

514
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,586
Help me.

515
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,526
Please, believe me.

516
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:58,634
Now, why in the world would I
believe a lying convict like you?

517
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,202
I can get us out. I swear.

518
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:04,136
Help me. Help me, and I will
treat you like a brother.

519
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,104
My brother used to beat me.
Nice guess, though.

520
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,802
No, no, hold on! Wait.
Just make one phone call.

521
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,006
One fucking phone call. Go into the house
and make one phone call.

522
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,582
An aviation company.

523
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:20,122
Tell them the word I say, and they will say
the plane will meet us tonight.

524
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,815
I swear. The plane will meet us tonight.

525
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,295
You a fag, my friend?

526
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:38,168
- No, I'm not.
- Then what are you looking at me for?

527
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,937
I was just thinking how fucking
surprised you're gonna be.

528
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:45,104
Because, baby, you just did
that fucking good turn.

529
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:48,251
I'm gonna make you rich, fat and happy
for the rest of your life.

530
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,353
No, just get me on the plane.

531
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,683
You like girls?

532
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,250
Better question: Where you been
so long, do you like girls?

533
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,394
We have... You will have...

534
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,054
...the most beautiful...
- Yeah, beautiful women.

535
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,790
Not women, baby.

536
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:06,697
Girls. You got to trust me.

537
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,930
All young. All blond.

538
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,371
And this all takes place where?

539
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,206
In Dubai. In Yemen.

540
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,441
When we get to Maskala.

541
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,674
And now, what's Maskala?

542
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,445
- When we get to Dubai.
- What's Maskala?

543
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,484
It's where we clean them up.

544
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:26,987
We ship them rough...

545
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:30,558
...we make them nice and smooth,
and everybody's happy.

546
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,494
You're just a philosopher, then, huh?
How about making me happy tonight?

547
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,893
If there's a girl in the pipeline tonight,
you shall have her.

548
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,798
What do you say to that?

549
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,735
I say you're a stone-cold whoremaster.

550
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,014
Fuck.

551
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,607
I'm bleeding bad, my friend.

552
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:09,859
- What you need?

553
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,160
Need some tailoring tools.

554
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,737
If I had a wish list, I'd get you to
a drugstore. I'd get some morphine.

555
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,937
That'd get you back on Happy Street.
Then you get me on that plane tonight.

556
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,380
- Where's the gauze, ma'am?
- Right behind you.

557
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,340
The helo just went down.

558
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:02,485
Don't whisper. It draws heat. The helo?

559
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,678
The assault helicopter.

560
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,688
You'll be alone for
the first few minutes. Then...

561
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,056
That's it. You'll have
no backup at the house.

562
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,128
Well, there you go, then.

563
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,699
You said never go in without
an over-watch.

564
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,199
Yeah, that's fine, pal,
but this is the fleet.

565
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,470
You deliver him in the door,
you know they're gonna waste you.

566
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:26,469
Give me all your magazines.

567
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:29,203
Give me all your magazines.

568
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,539
Give me your piece.

569
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,428
Okay.

570
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:51,963
Just this, ma'am.

571
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,037
Fourteen ninety-five.

572
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,004
- Keep the change.
- I want to talk to you.

573
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,759
Give me your ammunition.

574
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,496
Hey, mister, you forgot your change.

575
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,325
It's a cop! It's a cop!

576
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,033
Don't move. Stay still.

577
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:06,732
Call 9-1-1!

578
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,810
Get back! Call 9-1-1!

579
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:15,979
No hostage, no hostage. We're in recovery.
Our 10 fast ropers...

580
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:17,677
Kill it.

581
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,321
Get us the fuck out of here.

582
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:23,653
All right, break it down, pack it up.
Now, now, now. Move it!

583
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,222
They hit the house. Girl wasn't there.

584
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,731
They found some signs.
She may have been there.

585
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,803
So we're going home
to deploy to Dubai.

586
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,241
Pack it up, strap it down.

587
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:45,371
The girls are taken from the house.
A holding facility, a compound?

588
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,078
It is my understanding, a compound.

589
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,948
- Drugged?
- He said.

590
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,886
"We ship them rough.
We clean them up.

591
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:59,017
Taken from Maskala
to the Royale Hotel in Dubai."

592
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,764
- All right. That's it.
- I've got you.

593
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,162
Affirmative.

594
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,895
Affirmative. No, keep the line open.

595
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,836
They'll have satellite photos
of the Maskala house...

596
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,409
...and the Royale Hotel, Dubai,
on the ground.

597
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:18,514
You'll restage, wheels up for Dubai
two hours after touchdown.

598
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,343
How many teams?

599
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,651
What? Three.
Three teams for Dubai.

600
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:30,558
Press has the report.
She missed her first class.

601
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:33,059
- Punch out the TRX...
- How you doing, chief?

602
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,822
Five by five.

603
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,895
All my readings are nominal.
Six two. Seven two.

604
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,871
What time is it?

605
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,705
What do you care?

606
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,777
I fucked up.

607
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,609
Hey, you want a...?

608
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,550
You want some more dope?
Want a Dr. Pepper?

609
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,585
I tried to help.

610
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,749
Yeah, well...

611
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:07,221
...that's usually when people do
fuck up.

612
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,963
Listen.

613
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:12,659
You're gonna take that fight
to bed with you for a long time.

614
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:15,634
You don't gotta do it all now.

615
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,602
Where's the girl?

616
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,075
We gotta get the girl back.

617
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,815
I saw the sign.

618
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,281
What?

619
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,786
I saw the sign.

620
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,192
Then you are truly blessed.

621
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,466
Yep, all set up.

622
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:56,237
All right, let's get your flight plans.

623
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,107
- There's one on the thing.
- Yeah.

624
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,273
I got three pallets for the lead plane.

625
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,622
You still carrying that?

626
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,815
Yeah, I suppose I do.

627
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:19,894
Black, Jacqueline A. 24341924.

628
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,368
Can you get me on, sir?

629
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:23,904
Can you get me on?

630
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,669
- I'm just a worker bee.
- Two fellas in green.

631
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,142
Man-to-man, can you get me
on the plane?

632
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,076
Why would I want to do that, sergeant?

633
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,581
I mean, if you owed me money
or something...

634
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,384
...might want to give you a job.
- They're gonna need a woman there.

635
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,887
For her.

636
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,719
They haven't thought about that yet,
but they will.

637
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,327
Can you get me on the plane?

638
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,495
Thank you, sergeant.

639
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,668
Stand by, number five.

640
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:00,372
- All right.
- Keep on top of the tac air navigation.

641
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:02,341
Everyone's gotta be in the loop.

642
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:08,007
Guard frequency is 1727.9.

643
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:14,590
All right, gentlemen, may I have your
attention for one moment, please.

644
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:17,090
We'll be going through it on the plane.

645
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:21,219
The mission is to safely extract
the hostage.

646
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:24,265
To safely extract the hostage.

647
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:29,736
In outline, this is a smash and grab.
It is a straightforward extraction.

648
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:33,774
The hostage will be in transit.
One team will assault the vehicle.

649
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,174
One team will secure the perimeter.

650
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,473
Who's got the girl?

651
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,745
One team ready to lay supportive fire.

652
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,819
And exfil as per your ops plan.

653
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:48,446
The rules of engagement are:
Weapons free.

654
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,985
- Weapons free.
- Go.

655
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:56,191
We expect slight, I repeat,
slight opposition.

656
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,932
Okay, let's pack it up
and put it on the bus.

657
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,660
Sir!

658
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,907
It is confirmed.
The death of Laura Newton.

659
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:18,248
We have word from the Coast Guard
that the bodies have been identified.

660
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,117
Reporting from Harvard Square,
this is Jody Snider.

661
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:25,387
- Can there be any doubt?
- The Secret Service, for obvious reasons...

662
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:28,827
...keep meticulous records,
the DNA, the fingerprints.

663
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:32,833
- Yes.
- And she had just been in the water...

664
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,630
...for four hours, apparently.

665
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:40,502
And she had been sailing with
one of her professors, Gerald Sloane.

666
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:47,413
We are gonna have some video
coming in just now.

667
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:51,213
And we see the body bags
being removed from the water.

668
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:55,222
This is off of Martha's vineyard, here.

669
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:59,795
The divers, the Navy divers in the water,
who recovered her body...

670
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,261
...and that of Professor Sloane.

671
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:08,860
As we look at these... This video,
shocking video of...

672
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,504
You might want to eat something.

673
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:18,938
Real deal is:

674
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,810
The boat went down...

675
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,420
...girl and the professor
washed up naked.

676
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,487
Coked out.

677
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,647
Coast Guard dresses them up.

678
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,792
Nice knife.

679
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,329
Yeah.

680
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,326
Got it off an East German fella.

681
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:43,031
He give it to you for a gift?

682
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,571
No.

683
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,838
As I recall, he was...

684
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,980
...rather reluctant to part with it.

685
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:58,684
Yeah, I always knew you Marines
were a weepy bunch of motherfuckers.

686
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,916
I got something in my eye.

687
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:03,559
- Tragedy such as this.

688
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:08,494
Yes, particularly coming right at the start
of his reelection campaign.

689
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,692
Hey, Joe, come take a look at this.

690
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,439
- How you been?
- Here you go, Dad.

691
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,131
- Working hard.
- Bet you have.

692
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,140
- Morning.
- Howdy, kiddo.

693
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,539
How you been, Billy?

694
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,579
- Gallon gonna be enough?
- You been looking at my house?

695
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:28,946
Nope. Just trying to sell paint.
But now that you mention it...

696
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,916
- John.
- Hey, Mr. Reese.

697
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:34,284
- How's life on the road?
- Made some sales, missed some sales.

698
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:36,652
- Yeah.
- Those new seeds come in?

699
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,192
No, John, they have not.
I beg your pardon.

700
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:43,822
I know that little plot is your baby.
I'm gonna call them up and make it right.

701
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,366
I want to plant them
in the dark of the moon.

702
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,767
- That's the old ways, isn't it?
- Is it? Yeah, I suppose it is.

703
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:53,636
- Expected to see you a few days ago.
- Yeah. Took the long way home.

704
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,026
How'd you find me?

705
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,369
Well, didn't I just draw down
on my luck.

706
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,139
- Bobby, I need to talk to you.
- My name ain't Bobby.

707
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:33,009
I need to talk to you.

708
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:42,014
What's the matter, you got
post-traumatic stress disorder?

709
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:45,252
I hear they say there might be
environmental causes.

710
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:48,056
- Are they going to Dubai?
- How would I know?

711
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:51,928
Because there's a slave trade
going on of American women.

712
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:55,628
- They sending you in?
- We'll leave that to our betters.

713
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,171
- Why don't you ask them?
- Why would I want to know?

714
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,037
I ain't a planner, I ain't a thinker.
I never wanted to be.

715
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:03,611
You got to set your motherfucker
to receive.

716
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,213
Listen to me.

717
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:07,906
They don't go through the door,
we don't ask why.

718
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:10,712
That's not a cost, it's benefit.

719
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:13,856
Because we get to travel light.
They tell me where to go.

720
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,617
- Tell me what to do when I get there.
- What about...?

721
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,988
You wanted to go
through the looking glass.

722
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,689
How was it?
Was it more fun than miniature golf?

723
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,068
- Who frisked the son of a bitch?
- What son of a bitch?

724
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,470
The secret service agent, shot himself?

725
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,872
Screwing his girlfriend.
Killed himself in shame.

726
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,069
- Shot himself with a hideout pistol?
- Yeah.

727
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,408
Who frisked the son of a bitch?

728
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,710
You'll have to go half-speed, baby,
because I don't follow you.

729
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:46,083
- Is there an operation in Dubai, sir?
- Pal...

730
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,820
...the girl fell off a boat. She's dead.

731
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,518
I'm on leave.
I don't know nothing about Dubai.

732
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,323
I don't know what the hell
you want with me.

733
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,499
There's a Army depending on us
for the truth.

734
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:05,737
You can lie to anyone else.
Never lie to a Ranger.

735
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,877
Okay, so that's you calling me a liar.

736
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:11,372
Sir, I saw the sign!

737
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:16,343
- What sign is that?
- At the beach house. She was there.

738
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:19,386
She wasn't there. She died on a boat.

739
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,417
I saw the sign.

740
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:25,689
Sir.

741
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,921
You saw the sign?
You were up for a week.

742
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:30,327
You don't know what you saw
your first time out.

743
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,297
Sir, I know what I saw.

744
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:36,029
You didn't see no sign because she
wasn't there. The hardest thing?

745
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:39,402
You know what it is?
It isn't going in the door, it's coming out.

746
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,437
You ever come down off of drugs?

747
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,910
The most powerful drug
in the world is adrenaline.

748
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,879
- I told you everything I know. Stand down.
- Look in the bag.

749
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,781
- Stand down!
- Sir, under my mat!

750
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:54,054
This got caught in my mat
at the beach house.

751
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,657
Would you tell me what that is?

752
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:09,297
The girl is not dead, sir.

753
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,125
Would you show me
where you found the earring?

754
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,496
I laid the mat down right here.

755
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,731
What?

756
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,699
The house looked closer that night.

757
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:50,278
Barometer's falling.
Low pressure, objects appear farther.

758
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:53,313
Watch the weather, baby,
because it's going to change.

759
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,882
Yeah.

760
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,485
Will you show me
where you saw the sign?

761
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,878
Yeah, hold on.

762
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,830
Hey, it was over here!

763
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,353
Let me speak to the chinaman.

764
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:22,617
You tell him, "The only man
ever heard him call on Jesus."

765
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,316
Yeah.

766
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:31,365
Yoke me out.

767
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:35,026
New set of clothes from the skin out.
Full set of papers.

768
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,696
I don't care where, but now.
You gotta get me to the tall corn.

769
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,968
I'll get you the money.

770
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,208
All right.

771
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,076
Two hours.

772
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,113
No.

773
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:51,548
Wait.

774
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,249
Not two hours.

775
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,257
Something later.

776
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,292
I'll get back to you.

777
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:10,729
The original building,
of course, dates to 1928.

778
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,673
The center for the treatment of alcoholism,
later, of substance abuse...

779
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:19,110
...takes its current name, The clearings,
from the original Johnson farm.

780
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,341
Would you please follow me
to the right.

781
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:25,044
The farm and its 2ooo acres were
a gift from the Johnsons...

782
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:15,533
- what could be worse than losing a child?
- Yes.

783
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,007
You'd like to comfort them,
but you don't know how.

784
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,871
I always think it's best just to...

785
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:25,445
- what is it?
- Security breach. Probably a phone threat.

786
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,208
It's all right. They're moving her
down to transport now.

787
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:30,011
It's okay, I'm with secret service.

788
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:35,180
Guess again. I'm secret service. And you'll
follow my directions, or I'll shoot you dead.

789
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:37,087
- Yes.
- Step away from the door.

790
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:39,352
Yes. I have a message for her.

791
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:43,831
- I have something to tell her.
- Take two steps to your left.

792
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:49,467
Yes. I have a message for Mrs. Newton.

793
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:52,869
I'm sure you do. Spread your arms,
please, out to the sides.

794
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,669
Open your hands.

795
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,308
- Open the box.
- I...

796
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,577
I'm 1 o minutes from the bomb squad.
If it's happy birthday, let's do it now.

797
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:05,243
Open the box.

798
01:07:30,525 --> 01:07:32,186
They took her protection.

799
01:07:32,394 --> 01:07:33,520
Her father was in town.

800
01:07:33,695 --> 01:07:36,789
They took the secret service detail off her
to take him tomcatting.

801
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:39,092
He didn't come to see her,
he came to get laid.

802
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:40,757
He's been doing it for years.

803
01:07:40,936 --> 01:07:43,769
He took her protection.
She got snatched.

804
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,270
The girl on the boat,
how do you fake the DNA?

805
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:50,639
- Laura Newton's alive.
- I don't know if Laura Newton's alive.

806
01:07:50,812 --> 01:07:53,007
I know they lied.
How do you fake the DNA?

807
01:07:53,181 --> 01:07:55,843
You don't fake the DNA.
You issue a press release.

808
01:07:56,418 --> 01:08:00,047
- Her father would let her die?
- Did you try to contact him?

809
01:08:00,222 --> 01:08:02,622
- I did, yes.
- And you still don't get it, do you?

810
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:05,089
You don't get it.
These people are savages.

811
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,319
They don't know
how many children they have.

812
01:08:07,496 --> 01:08:09,862
She was snatched
while he was cheating on his wife.

813
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:12,432
It comes out, they lose the election.

814
01:08:13,268 --> 01:08:16,260
So they said, "Let her go."

815
01:08:16,938 --> 01:08:19,463
- Who?
- His handlers.

816
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,575
- What does he know?
- What they tell him.

817
01:08:21,743 --> 01:08:24,109
- What did they tell him?
- That she was dead.

818
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:28,113
- Why?
- So he'd stop looking for her.

819
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:31,312
Oh, baby.

820
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:35,388
Where are you going?

821
01:08:35,557 --> 01:08:39,152
- I have to get a lot of running room.
- Wait. Who will get her back?

822
01:08:40,495 --> 01:08:42,156
- What?
- Who will get her back?

823
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,093
- I did my part.
- What part was that?

824
01:08:44,266 --> 01:08:46,598
- They gotta get her back.
- There is no "they."

825
01:08:46,768 --> 01:08:48,429
- I'm just a worker bee...
- she'll die.

826
01:08:48,603 --> 01:08:50,901
- Then go through the mother.
- I'm her mother!

827
01:08:56,645 --> 01:08:59,739
She gave birth to her. I raised her.

828
01:09:04,986 --> 01:09:08,046
I'm her mother.
She's just a little girl.

829
01:09:09,091 --> 01:09:11,321
You have to get her back.
I have nobody.

830
01:09:11,493 --> 01:09:14,121
Nobody ever loved her but me.

831
01:09:14,296 --> 01:09:16,924
She's just a little girl.

832
01:09:28,009 --> 01:09:31,775
It's been quite a long while
since my last confession.

833
01:09:34,249 --> 01:09:37,116
We were getting shelled in the open.

834
01:09:37,285 --> 01:09:40,846
And I confessed that I was frightened.

835
01:09:42,124 --> 01:09:43,989
So I suppose I'm...

836
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:46,525
I suppose I'm frightened now.

837
01:09:49,364 --> 01:09:51,525
There was a king...

838
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,861
...and he had a daughter...

839
01:09:54,035 --> 01:09:56,663
...and she was abducted.

840
01:09:57,539 --> 01:10:00,804
He vowed to protect her, you see, but...

841
01:10:00,976 --> 01:10:05,208
...while he was indulging
himself, shamefully...

842
01:10:06,815 --> 01:10:09,045
...she was abducted.

843
01:10:13,555 --> 01:10:17,616
They tried to get her back and failed.

844
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:22,822
Now, his advisors realized
that if the girl returned...

845
01:10:22,998 --> 01:10:27,765
...it would reveal the king's shame
to the country.

846
01:10:29,137 --> 01:10:33,073
So they told him that she was dead.

847
01:10:34,609 --> 01:10:37,601
Ain't nobody here
but two people in green.

848
01:10:39,014 --> 01:10:41,380
It goes beyond that.

849
01:10:41,883 --> 01:10:44,317
Nothing goes beyond that.

850
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:05,133
This girl, they told the king
that she was dead...

851
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:07,639
...and everybody grieved.

852
01:11:08,376 --> 01:11:10,776
But she was alive.

853
01:11:12,848 --> 01:11:15,146
Then you better go get her.

854
01:11:19,487 --> 01:11:21,512
We know this house.

855
01:11:22,424 --> 01:11:25,416
Maskala is a suburban villa in Dubai.

856
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:28,053
Some people operate
a halfway house there...

857
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,698
...for young women they have
coerced or drugged...

858
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:35,667
...into spending their short lives
as whores for Arabian tourists.

859
01:11:35,837 --> 01:11:40,274
Of late, the girls have been, in the main,
from the former sov bloc.

860
01:11:40,442 --> 01:11:44,208
Now and again, a North American girl,
if she is exceedingly lovely...

861
01:11:44,379 --> 01:11:46,643
...blond, usually blond...

862
01:11:46,815 --> 01:11:49,340
...will unfortunately find
her way to Dubai.

863
01:11:50,151 --> 01:11:51,812
They travel drugged.

864
01:11:51,987 --> 01:11:55,980
They are tidied up and sold. For some
reason, most of them are sold to Yemen.

865
01:11:56,424 --> 01:11:59,621
The girls are generally held in Dubai
till the end of the month...

866
01:11:59,794 --> 01:12:03,355
...when the merrymakers fly in to examine
their purchases and take them home.

867
01:12:03,531 --> 01:12:06,625
- And then?
- That is "and then."

868
01:12:06,801 --> 01:12:09,269
- This is an American girl?
- And if that were so?

869
01:12:09,437 --> 01:12:12,600
If that were so, why don't
your people go and fetch her?

870
01:12:12,774 --> 01:12:17,837
- Why don't they go and get her, Bobby?
- Your intel, two men. Infil, exfil.

871
01:12:18,013 --> 01:12:20,709
- Hardware and comms.
- And comms to what? I cannot give you.

872
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:23,942
- You could when you were a Boy scout.
- I'm not in scouts anymore.

873
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:27,316
You heard of the private sector?
That's where you found me.

874
01:12:27,489 --> 01:12:29,582
Well, then sell me something.

875
01:12:29,758 --> 01:12:32,283
What the fuck are we talking about?

876
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,430
- That's what it costs?
- That's what it costs you.

877
01:12:41,603 --> 01:12:43,298
It's a straight-up snatch.

878
01:12:43,471 --> 01:12:45,371
We got one, two guys
take down the car.

879
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:49,169
Then what are we talking about?
A conex container? One guy for a day?

880
01:12:49,344 --> 01:12:53,178
Who's looking for a whore?
This job's a gimme. This job's nothing.

881
01:12:53,715 --> 01:12:55,740
Then why don't your people
go and get her?

882
01:12:55,917 --> 01:12:58,408
- I could hire anybody.
- So go hire them.

883
01:12:58,586 --> 01:13:01,453
You talked to me. That's my price.

884
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:06,223
- There's another alternative.
- What?

885
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:08,885
As I said, we know this house.

886
01:13:09,297 --> 01:13:12,232
- There are some people in this house...
- Avi.

887
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,800
...that if you were to go
while you were there...

888
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:17,768
...if you said hello to them for me,
I could cut your price.

889
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:20,772
- What do you think I am?
- I don't know what you are.

890
01:13:20,942 --> 01:13:22,910
You ain't a planner.
You're a shooter.

891
01:13:23,078 --> 01:13:26,912
I don't know what you are doing here.
I think you're off the reservation.

892
01:13:27,849 --> 01:13:31,046
And I think there are people
looking for you.

893
01:13:31,219 --> 01:13:34,552
You call, "Yoke me out."
Then you call for information.

894
01:13:34,723 --> 01:13:38,557
You don't need information.
You need advice.

895
01:13:38,727 --> 01:13:41,787
You wanna get this girl?
Are you sure she is there?

896
01:13:41,963 --> 01:13:44,397
Are you sure she is alive?

897
01:13:46,334 --> 01:13:48,768
You let me make a call,
and I will tell you.

898
01:13:48,937 --> 01:13:51,098
I will see if I can make peace.

899
01:13:51,272 --> 01:13:54,639
If I cannot, I will help you disappear.

900
01:13:55,944 --> 01:13:58,811
Because you heard me call on Jesus.

901
01:13:59,714 --> 01:14:02,808
Let me help you to see
if you can go home.

902
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:12,653
Excuse me. Fasten your seat belt.

903
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:14,920
We're landing soon.

904
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:16,757
Thank you.

905
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:55,035
Sir, your container is
booked out on Transgeneve.

906
01:14:55,203 --> 01:14:56,830
Flight 562.

907
01:14:57,005 --> 01:14:58,836
134o, tomorrow.

908
01:14:59,007 --> 01:15:01,942
Good. Thank you very much.
I appreciate your help.

909
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:06,342
Mate, can I have a quick word?
I've got an outbound at 8:15.

910
01:15:06,514 --> 01:15:08,675
- I'm in a bit of a hurry.
- Just a moment.

911
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:12,342
- Yes, sir. Let me see your form.
- Thanks, man, I really appreciate it.

912
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:28,128
Let me see your form.

913
01:16:20,989 --> 01:16:25,949
- Sir? Sir?
- Yes, I'll seal you in.

914
01:16:26,127 --> 01:16:31,394
- Sorry to press you.
- No, no. It's been a very busy day.

915
01:16:35,937 --> 01:16:38,497
Same wherever you go.

916
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:44,043
Guess that's just human nature,
but no need to tell you your business.

917
01:16:45,547 --> 01:16:49,074
There you go. Your container
is all sealed for you.

918
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,115
- Thank you for your patience.
- Thank you.

919
01:16:51,286 --> 01:16:52,844
Have a great day.

920
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:03,588
Hey, mate.

921
01:17:03,765 --> 01:17:05,027
Hey, mate.

922
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,827
Are you Mr. Brown's cousin?

923
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:08,935
No, Mr. Jackson couldn't come.

924
01:17:13,942 --> 01:17:17,844
- I was expecting you on a later flight.
- How about that?

925
01:17:22,116 --> 01:17:25,244
Yes, this is good work.

926
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:30,449
Your job tomorrow is put us in,
seal us in, walk away.

927
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:33,822
- And in Geneva?
- Let's go look at the ground.

928
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:38,427
About 25, 26 yards from the corner,
I want the gasoline.

929
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,625
Tomorrow, the car comes
around the corner...

930
01:17:40,802 --> 01:17:42,963
How do we stop the car?

931
01:17:43,137 --> 01:17:46,698
- We slow it down with two Bedouin women.
- What do you want the gasoline for?

932
01:17:46,874 --> 01:17:48,671
- Do you speak Arabic?
- Yes, sir.

933
01:17:48,843 --> 01:17:52,176
I want the women here.
At your signal, they go in the street...

934
01:17:52,347 --> 01:17:55,043
...start a screaming match.
I shoot the tires out.

935
01:17:55,216 --> 01:17:57,514
The driver comes out. You cap him.
I get the girl.

936
01:17:57,685 --> 01:18:00,552
- What if he doesn't come out?
- I got five gallons of gasoline.

937
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:05,182
I douse the car. I throw a match.
They're coming out.

938
01:18:07,228 --> 01:18:09,958
When you get me the two women...

939
01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:14,296
...pay them half now, half tomorrow.

940
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:17,563
Then I want you to show me the hive.
We'll lay low till tonight.

941
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:20,537
Then show me the house
where they keep the girl.

942
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:49,694
All right. Limousine, usually.

943
01:18:49,871 --> 01:18:53,238
It makes a turn, comes down
Abu Baku, where we were today.

944
01:18:53,408 --> 01:18:56,935
My job is the hostage.
Your job is the opposition.

945
01:18:57,111 --> 01:19:01,172
You come in on the driver's side.
You cap the driver.

946
01:19:01,349 --> 01:19:04,011
The map's wrong.
This isn't north. It's flipped.

947
01:19:04,185 --> 01:19:07,780
You have to be on the east side.
I need the sun in the driver's eyes.

948
01:19:07,955 --> 01:19:10,423
I've gotta come in
on the opposite side.

949
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,582
How did you know that was north?

950
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:16,423
That's cassiopeia.
That's my girlfriend.

951
01:19:40,388 --> 01:19:42,413
They're moving the girl.

952
01:19:43,758 --> 01:19:45,123
Looks like it.

953
01:19:53,534 --> 01:19:56,128
- Did you burn me?
- Can't say I did.

954
01:19:56,304 --> 01:19:59,569
- You wanna prove it?
- Well, the Lord hates a coward.

955
01:19:59,874 --> 01:20:01,341
We're taking the girl now.

956
01:20:19,927 --> 01:20:23,454
Keep your eyes on me.
We're gonna fight the girl out.

957
01:20:23,765 --> 01:20:27,292
If I go down, get her to Geneva.
There's money in it for you.

958
01:20:27,468 --> 01:20:29,698
I'm gonna grab the girl.

959
01:20:31,139 --> 01:20:32,401
You keep them off my back.

960
01:20:32,573 --> 01:20:35,303
You wanna gossip
or you wanna shoot somebody?

961
01:20:55,096 --> 01:20:58,065
Stop. Wait, wait.

962
01:22:20,147 --> 01:22:21,705
Shut your fucking mouth.

963
01:22:58,653 --> 01:23:00,848
- Where am I?
- I'm here to take you home.

964
01:23:01,022 --> 01:23:04,514
You got to keep still.
I'm here to take you home.

965
01:23:13,467 --> 01:23:15,059
Drink it.

966
01:23:17,872 --> 01:23:20,864
- Who are you?
- Drink it.

967
01:23:34,355 --> 01:23:36,255
How are you?

968
01:23:36,924 --> 01:23:38,892
I'm sick.

969
01:23:39,493 --> 01:23:41,984
No, it's just a formal question.

970
01:23:43,864 --> 01:23:45,525
Cover your head.

971
01:23:46,867 --> 01:23:50,132
- What, you don't like blondes?
- The whole world likes blondes.

972
01:23:50,304 --> 01:23:53,137
That's why you're here. Put it on.

973
01:23:53,874 --> 01:23:55,967
Put it on.

974
01:23:58,012 --> 01:24:00,446
And stay away from the window.

975
01:24:03,384 --> 01:24:05,579
- I need a smoke.
- You can't smoke it.

976
01:24:05,753 --> 01:24:07,516
What's it gonna give me, cancer?

977
01:24:07,688 --> 01:24:11,681
Smell of American tobacco
carries in the desert air.

978
01:24:12,627 --> 01:24:15,221
That's why you wanna
stay out of the desert.

979
01:24:29,744 --> 01:24:32,736
I could make you give me the smoke.

980
01:24:38,152 --> 01:24:40,416
Keep it together.

981
01:24:40,588 --> 01:24:43,819
Keep your voice down.
We're gonna get you home.

982
01:24:54,802 --> 01:24:57,498
Fuck it. I don't wanna go home.

983
01:24:57,672 --> 01:25:00,106
Nobody there cares about me.

984
01:25:00,274 --> 01:25:03,209
I'm just a whore.
I'm just a little whore.

985
01:25:03,377 --> 01:25:05,242
Yeah, how'd you get like that?

986
01:25:07,148 --> 01:25:09,946
I was raised by wolves.

987
01:25:13,888 --> 01:25:16,550
What are you crying for?
We're going home.

988
01:25:22,863 --> 01:25:24,888
Did my father send you?

989
01:25:25,066 --> 01:25:26,465
That's right.

990
01:25:26,634 --> 01:25:28,124
Why?

991
01:25:28,803 --> 01:25:30,998
Why? He wants me dead.

992
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:32,906
He sent me.

993
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,175
One man.

994
01:25:35,342 --> 01:25:38,436
"One riot, one Ranger."
You ever heard that?

995
01:25:38,612 --> 01:25:40,546
Leonidas, King of sparta...

996
01:25:40,715 --> 01:25:45,516
...when a neighboring state would plead
for military aid, would send one man.

997
01:25:45,686 --> 01:25:48,655
- Well, there you go.
- You ever hear that?

998
01:25:48,823 --> 01:25:52,987
No. I think we went
to different schools.

999
01:25:53,227 --> 01:25:57,027
You ever hear the one about the king
who turned his daughter into gold?

1000
01:25:58,499 --> 01:26:01,696
Yeah. He turned his daughter
into gold.

1001
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:05,430
America's sweetheart.

1002
01:26:05,606 --> 01:26:10,043
His fucking trick pony. His election ad.

1003
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:13,271
Fucking cocksuckers.

1004
01:26:13,848 --> 01:26:17,784
He took the guards away.

1005
01:26:18,219 --> 01:26:23,316
I just wanted to talk to him.
He wouldn't even come and see me.

1006
01:26:23,491 --> 01:26:25,425
He said he would come and see me.

1007
01:26:25,593 --> 01:26:27,652
He sent a man.

1008
01:26:27,828 --> 01:26:32,629
"Here's what you tell the press.
Don't talk. Don't tell anybody."

1009
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,530
I told him I was gonna tell.

1010
01:26:35,703 --> 01:26:38,638
He had to come and see me.

1011
01:26:39,673 --> 01:26:42,642
And he wouldn't even come
and see me.

1012
01:26:44,245 --> 01:26:46,338
He sent me.

1013
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:03,820
I don't wanna go home.

1014
01:27:06,634 --> 01:27:07,965
Look, you go home...

1015
01:27:08,135 --> 01:27:11,969
...some wave their hats,
some turn their backs.

1016
01:27:12,139 --> 01:27:13,800
It's all the same.

1017
01:27:13,974 --> 01:27:16,408
None of them know where you've been.

1018
01:27:16,577 --> 01:27:19,137
It's all the same.

1019
01:27:20,014 --> 01:27:21,982
You tough, honey?

1020
01:27:23,684 --> 01:27:25,845
I think you're tough.

1021
01:28:06,627 --> 01:28:08,720
I'm cold.

1022
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:11,691
It'll be fine, baby.

1023
01:28:11,866 --> 01:28:14,460
You're gonna take a little flight
in here.

1024
01:28:15,836 --> 01:28:19,897
- You're coming with me.
- No, I've got to seal you in.

1025
01:28:20,074 --> 01:28:21,701
You want a cigarette?

1026
01:28:21,876 --> 01:28:25,141
- Can you produce one?
- Believe I can.

1027
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,604
Sit down.

1028
01:28:29,049 --> 01:28:31,813
You said they couldn't violate
their airspace.

1029
01:28:31,986 --> 01:28:35,888
- What?
- They couldn't violate their airspace.

1030
01:28:36,056 --> 01:28:39,856
That's right.
They couldn't violate their airspace.

1031
01:28:42,463 --> 01:28:46,797
- That's why you had to come alone.
- That's why I had to come alone.

1032
01:28:53,841 --> 01:28:56,002
But I tell you what...

1033
01:28:56,176 --> 01:28:57,939
...when this plane touches down...

1034
01:28:58,445 --> 01:29:02,575
...you will be in the bosom of
a company of United states Marines...

1035
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:06,743
...all straight up and down
and vying for your attention.

1036
01:29:08,055 --> 01:29:09,488
What could be better?

1037
01:29:11,692 --> 01:29:13,489
Do you have a comb?

1038
01:29:14,862 --> 01:29:17,353
I don't believe I ever carried one.

1039
01:29:22,436 --> 01:29:24,267
Thank you.

1040
01:29:24,438 --> 01:29:26,303
For what?

1041
01:29:26,473 --> 01:29:28,668
For coming for me.

1042
01:29:31,712 --> 01:29:33,077
Well, what the hell.

1043
01:29:45,192 --> 01:29:46,853
What's that?

1044
01:29:47,061 --> 01:29:49,791
I believe it's an apple seed.

1045
01:29:51,065 --> 01:29:54,728
- Johnny Appleseed.
- Yeah, that's me. Just a man of peace.

1046
01:30:47,654 --> 01:30:51,385
Get on the phone. Get to our people.
See if they can seal off...

1047
01:30:52,426 --> 01:30:53,552
There she is. Get her!

1048
01:31:07,975 --> 01:31:10,637
Cut him off. Cut him off!

1049
01:31:24,892 --> 01:31:26,382
Laura Newton!

1050
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,357
Laura!

1051
01:31:31,498 --> 01:31:34,228
You! The man.

1052
01:31:34,401 --> 01:31:37,336
Step away from the girl.

1053
01:31:37,638 --> 01:31:40,004
Walk to me, Miss Newton.

1054
01:31:40,174 --> 01:31:42,267
Walk to me.

1055
01:31:44,711 --> 01:31:48,442
My name is stoddard.
You've seen me in your home...

1056
01:31:48,615 --> 01:31:50,810
...with Mr. Burch.

1057
01:31:50,984 --> 01:31:54,147
You're almost home. Walk to me.

1058
01:31:55,656 --> 01:31:58,489
This man is a rogue agent.

1059
01:31:58,659 --> 01:32:00,991
He came here to take you...

1060
01:32:01,161 --> 01:32:02,788
...for the ransom.

1061
01:32:02,963 --> 01:32:06,558
Even if it was true,
you're coming with me.

1062
01:32:06,733 --> 01:32:08,963
- Get up.
- Laura?

1063
01:32:11,438 --> 01:32:13,736
This man was sent to harm you.

1064
01:32:13,907 --> 01:32:17,468
He knows I'm not leaving here
without you.

1065
01:32:17,778 --> 01:32:20,110
Give her up.

1066
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,646
Give the girl up...

1067
01:32:22,816 --> 01:32:24,147
...and we can talk.

1068
01:32:24,918 --> 01:32:28,012
We have control of the airport.

1069
01:32:29,456 --> 01:32:30,980
Let her come forward.

1070
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:35,555
We leave in a minute.

1071
01:32:37,431 --> 01:32:38,864
Let me see what's going on.

1072
01:32:39,032 --> 01:32:40,693
- Okay.
- Mr. Scott.

1073
01:32:40,868 --> 01:32:42,995
- Robert scott.
- One more lap. Okay?

1074
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:45,832
We're gonna go get you on that plane.

1075
01:32:46,006 --> 01:32:48,440
You're gonna make it. Okay?

1076
01:32:48,609 --> 01:32:51,635
- Okay. Here we go.
- Laura, walk away from him.

1077
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:54,479
He knows the game is up.

1078
01:32:55,582 --> 01:32:58,779
He knows it's over. You're safe.

1079
01:33:05,792 --> 01:33:08,158
- Get on the plane!
- Bring out the camera.

1080
01:33:08,328 --> 01:33:10,057
- What do you see?
- I'm getting it!

1081
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:13,996
Get it out! I'm not leaving
until I find out what's going on.

1082
01:33:14,168 --> 01:33:17,228
- Find it. What do you see?
- Hold on. Hold on.

1083
01:33:19,773 --> 01:33:22,708
We've got you. We've got you now.

1084
01:33:22,876 --> 01:33:24,400
We've got you.

1085
01:33:27,881 --> 01:33:29,314
Thank God we found you.

1086
01:33:31,151 --> 01:33:33,745
Here you go. Come get her!

1087
01:33:33,921 --> 01:33:35,821
Thank goodness we found you.

1088
01:33:36,156 --> 01:33:37,885
Hey, get her out of here!

1089
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:42,754
Clean this mess up.

1090
01:33:51,638 --> 01:33:55,631
I'm at the airport.
It appears to be a gunfight.

1091
01:33:55,809 --> 01:33:57,367
A gunfight!

1092
01:33:57,544 --> 01:34:00,536
No, I don't know who.
I'm staying to tape it.

1093
01:34:01,815 --> 01:34:02,804
Hold the plane!

1094
01:34:15,562 --> 01:34:19,123
You could have come home!
You know that?

1095
01:34:19,299 --> 01:34:23,599
You dumb son of a bitch!
We needed you!

1096
01:34:24,905 --> 01:34:27,874
It's world war III out there!

1097
01:34:29,009 --> 01:34:32,740
World war III!
Do you read the papers?

1098
01:34:33,981 --> 01:34:38,179
And that little whore wanted to
bring the man down. At this time!

1099
01:34:38,685 --> 01:34:43,554
- I'm going home?
- That's right, honey. You bet you are.

1100
01:34:46,126 --> 01:34:47,650
And just one more thing.

1101
01:34:47,928 --> 01:34:50,829
- I'm getting in the car.
- No, honey, there is no car.

1102
01:34:50,998 --> 01:34:52,761
We have to get you out of here.

1103
01:34:52,933 --> 01:34:55,561
No. Who are you?

1104
01:35:09,049 --> 01:35:12,678
Me and Mr. Scott came to take you home.

1105
01:35:19,426 --> 01:35:23,453
Do you know what we've
had to do all these years...

1106
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:25,655
...to keep her under wraps?

1107
01:35:27,801 --> 01:35:30,634
You shortened her life, pal!

1108
01:35:30,804 --> 01:35:34,865
We would have let her go to the desert,
but you had to put on your thinking cap!

1109
01:35:39,646 --> 01:35:41,443
Hold on one minute!

1110
01:35:41,615 --> 01:35:43,674
- Go on, what do you see?
- Okay.

1111
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:56,227
- Are you getting it?
- Get on the plane.

1112
01:36:01,601 --> 01:36:03,466
Oh, my God.

1113
01:36:07,307 --> 01:36:09,571
- I got her.
- Hold the plane! Laura Newton!

1114
01:36:09,743 --> 01:36:11,768
Get her on the plane!
Get her out of here!

1115
01:36:11,945 --> 01:36:15,142
- Call the tower!
- Wait! Wait!

1116
01:36:15,315 --> 01:36:16,873
- Laura!
- Get us out of here.

1117
01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:20,486
Get her on the plane!
Get this girl on the plane!

1118
01:36:21,121 --> 01:36:23,954
Get her on the plane!
Get her on the plane!

1119
01:36:25,092 --> 01:36:27,060
Get us out of here!

1120
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:32,223
Get us up!

1121
01:37:22,115 --> 01:37:24,015
Oh, baby.

1122
01:37:32,392 --> 01:37:34,223
Oh, baby.

1123
01:37:34,594 --> 01:37:36,585
Is she safe?

1124
01:37:37,364 --> 01:37:39,059
Yeah.

1125
01:37:39,566 --> 01:37:41,466
She's safe.

1126
01:37:55,348 --> 01:37:57,407
We brought the girl back.

1127
01:37:58,985 --> 01:38:03,081
Yeah. She just took the long way home.

1128
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:33,613
CSv World News International.

1129
01:38:33,787 --> 01:38:35,379
And as we return again...

1130
01:38:35,555 --> 01:38:39,389
...the administration,
forced by this terrible abduction...

1131
01:38:39,559 --> 01:38:41,789
- Thank God they had that ability.
- That's right.

1132
01:38:41,962 --> 01:38:46,399
To capitalize on the drowning deaths,
to capitalize on the unfortunate deaths...

1133
01:38:46,566 --> 01:38:49,592
...of those two people sailing.

1134
01:38:52,105 --> 01:38:55,370
Here is the arrival
of Laura's father.

1135
01:38:57,244 --> 01:39:00,008
Who can forget these images?

1136
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:03,240
- Laura Newton in the United States.
- Yes, indeed.

1137
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:06,852
Many believe that Robert Burch
is due not only the thanks...

1138
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:10,581
...but the admiration of the
entire American people for his role.

1139
01:39:10,757 --> 01:39:13,248
Terror takes many forms.

1140
01:39:13,426 --> 01:39:18,591
I can conceive of no act of terror
greater than the unforgivable...

1141
01:39:18,765 --> 01:39:22,929
...the ultimate destruction,
that of a human soul.

1142
01:39:23,103 --> 01:39:25,799
The kidnapping of Laura Newton
has revealed to us...

1143
01:39:26,006 --> 01:39:29,442
...has allowed us to confront
and will allow us to eradicate...

1144
01:39:29,609 --> 01:39:32,009
...the international traffic in souls.

1145
01:39:32,178 --> 01:39:35,409
It was brought about because of
a family's love for their daughter.

1146
01:39:35,582 --> 01:39:38,244
A simple American act.

1147
01:39:38,451 --> 01:39:43,411
The love of Americans
for all our daughters...

1148
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:45,683
...who are the soul...

1149
01:39:49,996 --> 01:39:52,988
Who are the soul of this great country.

1150
01:39:53,166 --> 01:39:55,134
- We thank God...
- Time to go home.

1151
01:39:55,302 --> 01:39:59,329
...this one daughter has returned home.
We vow that we will not rest...

1152
01:39:59,506 --> 01:40:02,600
- Lucky man.
...until all who have suffered her fate...

1153
01:40:02,776 --> 01:40:05,677
...are once again reunited
with their families.

1154
01:40:06,012 --> 01:40:07,775
Thank you.

1155
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:49,771
