James McCullen, you Scottish pig,

2
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:19,069
you've been found guilty of treason
for the sale of military arms

3
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:22,377
to the enemies of our Lord,
King Louis XIII,

4
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:25,452
even whilst you sold arms
to our Lord himself.

5
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,323
Your king is a vile bag of filth
who murders his own allies.

6
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:34,019
I should have charged him double.

7
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:39,031
You tried to overthrow the Crown
in conspiracy with its enemies.

8
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,365
Unlike your simpleton king,
his enemies know

9
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:46,805
that it is the true McCullen destiny
not simply to supply arms,

10
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,501
but to run the wars!

11
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,341
Do you have anything else to say
before the sentence is carried out?

12
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:52,936
Yes, I do.

13
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:55,414
Clan McCullen is far greater
and more powerful

14
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:57,610
than any of you could ever imagine.

15
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,656
My sons will continue to rise
long after I am gone,

16
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:03,123
as will their sons

17
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:06,024
and, God willing, their sons.

18
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,688
It shall not end with my death!

19
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:12,199
We are not going to kill you, McCullen.

20
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:14,862
We're going to make an example of you!

21
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:23,105
So that no man, woman nor child may
ever see your treacherous face again,

22
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:27,582
you shall wear this mask
for the term of your natural life.

23
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:31,552
No! No! No!

24
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,460
For nearly 4 centuries,
my ancestors have been

25
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:50,335
the greatest creators of weaponry
in the world.

26
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,374
But perhaps in this century,
I'll outdo them all.

27
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:57,814
Nanomites, perfect little soldiers

28
00:02:57,915 --> 00:03:01,078
originally developed
to isolate and kill cancer cells.

29
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:02,482
But at MARS Industries,

30
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:05,053
and with the help
of a little NATO funding,

31
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:08,387
we discovered how to program them
to do almost anything.

32
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:11,087
For example, eat metal.

33
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:15,298
Watch this test
of the world's first nanomite warhead.

34
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:20,000
Each of these warheads
contains 7 million nanomites

35
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:23,097
and has the ability to eat anything
from a single tank

36
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,733
to an entire city.

37
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,449
As you can see, it quickly converts
to eating any and all material in its path.

38
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:37,946
Once unleashed,
the nanomites will not stop, ever.

39
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:39,820
Once the target has been destroyed,

40
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:42,689
the launcher triggers
a kill switch unique to each warhead

41
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:47,094
that short-circuits the nanomites,
preventing any unwanted destruction.

42
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:50,293
Gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce
that tomorrow morning,

43
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:54,863
your first order of nanotech warheads
ships from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.

44
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,727
Weapons case on the move.
ETA 2 minutes to NATO team.

45
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,705
All right, listen up.
NATO wants the best of the best.

46
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:31,437
That's why we're here.
We got Panthers front and back.

47
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:32,876
RHINO's carrying the package
in the middle.

48
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:36,437
Minimum distance at all times.
Apaches are covering us from overhead.

49
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,644
Detail, attention. Fall out, boys.

50
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,185
Captain Hauser,
Mr. McCullen requires a signature.

51
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,552
Not gonna explode, is it?

52
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,024
They're not weaponized yet,
and the kill switches are inside.

53
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:48,924
All the same,
I'd avoid potholes if I were you.

54
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:52,297
- Hey, Bill?
- Yeah?

55
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,425
Put that in the RHINO, would you?

56
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,030
All right, ladies! Mount up!

57
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:18,016
Okay, Apaches, we're heavy,
so keep your eyes open.

58
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:20,526
Roger that.
Skies are clear all the way to Ganci.

59
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:32,474
- Hey, Duke, I've been thinking.
- You know, I warned you about that.

60
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:34,007
I've been thinking about
where we should transfer to.

61
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:35,736
- Don't say the Air Force.
- The Air Force!

62
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:38,074
What did I say? I thought
we were done with this conversation.

63
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,738
You were done with this conversation,
not me.

64
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:40,848
You know, I've been flying

65
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:41,974
- since I was 13 years old.
-13 years old.

66
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:44,552
You know, I don't think your dad's
crop-duster counts as hours logged.

67
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:48,650
I'm talking jets, man. Jets.

68
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:51,590
And you know I qualify
every time we're on leave.

69
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,587
- You want to get up in the air?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:56,858
- I'll buy you a trampoline.
- I filled out the application.

71
00:05:58,268 --> 00:05:59,792
Really? They accept those in crayon?

72
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:01,632
Come on, dude.
Give me one good reason why not.

73
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:05,139
'Cause I want to be on the ground,
in the fight, not flying over it.

74
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:19,984
Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2,
going night vision.

75
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,989
- Roger that.
- Go ahead and back off.

76
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,888
Give me some separation.

77
00:06:23,993 --> 00:06:26,359
Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2. Going NVS.

78
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:27,462
Roger.

79
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:31,959
Hey, Duke,
weren't we supposed to meet up

80
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:33,832
with the recon team at 40 klicks?

81
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:37,395
- Yeah. So?
- Well, we just passed kilometer 41.

82
00:06:39,676 --> 00:06:42,578
- Eyes out, eyes out!
- Sweep's still clear, sir.

83
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,342
Roger that.
There's nothing up here but us.

84
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,957
Tom, put a self-test on the flare
and start to scan for...

85
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,288
Holy...

86
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:59,092
What the hell is that?

87
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,435
Pioneer 1, you've been hit.

88
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:12,302
Stop!

89
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:17,081
- Bird down! Bird down!
- Back up! Back up! Back up!

90
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,582
All units, we are under attack!
They're after the warheads!

91
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:20,708
Pioneer 2, engage!

92
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,846
- Put that asshole on the ground!
- Roger that. Put some hurt on this guy!

93
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:29,318
Tommy guns. Firing, firing, firing!

94
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:33,325
- Missiles armed.
- Match and shoot.

95
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:34,831
Match and shoot! Missiles off!

96
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:40,695
They shot them right out of the air.

97
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:45,505
Oh, my God.

98
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:56,646
- Pioneer 2 is down! We've lost our air!
- They're boxing us in!

99
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:59,316
All units, fan out!
I repeat, all units, fan out!

100
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,570
I want SAMs on that thing!
Light him up! Light him up!

101
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,448
He's coming around.
Get those. 50s on him!

102
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:31,423
Incoming!

103
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,055
Hold on!

104
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,897
You okay?

105
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:44,027
Yeah, but my leg is pinned.
What the hell was that?

106
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,547
- Come on, we gotta get in this fight.
- Careful, my leg!

107
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,179
Come on, buddy, let's go.
Let's go, get up, come on!

108
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,526
Duke, you gotta go get those warheads!

109
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,861
Shut up! I gotta get you out of here first!

110
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:48,229
Fire at the opening!
Right side, right side!

111
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,007
Get up, get up, get up, get up!

112
00:09:57,947 --> 00:09:59,346
My damn leg!

113
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,449
- You wait here, okay?
- Where are you going?

114
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:03,780
I gotta go get that case.

115
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,150
Air Force, right.

116
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,630
Don't move!

117
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,235
- Hello, Duke.
- Ana?

118
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:27,038
Now, you have to admit,
you had that coming.

119
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:39,646
Ana!

120
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:43,686
Ana!

121
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:19,728
Bye-bye.

122
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:28,634
Ana! Ana!

123
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:43,583
Don't make me shoot a woman.

124
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:48,316
Incoming!

125
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:11,546
Stand down. Stand the hell down!

126
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,882
- Put the weapon down, sir.
- We're not the enemy.

127
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:16,217
Pointing your weapons at me doesn't
make you my friend, now, does it?

128
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:17,381
Please hand over the case, sir.

129
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,959
I don't know you, and I sure as hell
don't know who they are,

130
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,891
and until I find out,
I'm not lowering anything

131
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:23,224
and I ain't handing anything over.

132
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:25,958
If it weren't for us, you'd be out there
with the rest of your boys.

133
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:28,660
- So hand over the case.
- What's your unit?

134
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:29,861
That's classified.

135
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,029
Someone would like to have
a word with you.

136
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:38,370
State your name and rank.

137
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:41,512
- You first.
- My team just saved your life, son.

138
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:43,776
This is the part
where you get to say thank you.

139
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:45,250
Those aren't the words
that come to mind right now.

140
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:47,583
I wasn't told anything
about any support for this mission,

141
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:49,122
so why don't you tell your team
to stand down?

142
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:50,850
We could turn this
into one big turkey shoot.

143
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,119
Yep.

144
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:54,554
Or not.

145
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:56,658
Easy, Ripcord.

146
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:58,425
- How do you know me?
- Expert marksman,

147
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:02,469
second in your battalion.
Weapons specialist, jet qualified.

148
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:04,337
- I told you.
- Not now, Rip.

149
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:08,934
My name is General Clayton Abernathy.
Perhaps you've heard of me, Duke.

150
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:11,911
General Hawk.
Afghanistan, NATO forward command.

151
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:15,915
Yeah, that was my last job.
I'm in a whole new outfit now.

152
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:19,453
Hey, I just need to deactivate
the tracking beacon for security.

153
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:23,252
Put down that weapons case, son,
and let us deliver those warheads.

154
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,088
No way. I signed for them.

155
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:27,755
It's my mission, my package.
I carry them, I deliver them.

156
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:31,299
Well, that's just fine, but you seem to be
a little short of transportation right now,

157
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,130
so my Team Alpha
will deliver you to me.

158
00:13:34,703 --> 00:13:36,034
And where exactly are you, sir?

159
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,471
Come see for yourself.

160
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,851
I thought all you Special Ops guys
were tough.

161
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,551
We are tough. But we're also sensitive.

162
00:13:57,927 --> 00:13:59,189
I got it. Thanks.

163
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:01,923
Wow, this is some primo stuff here.

164
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:05,928
Hey, bro, you got
some real lifelike hair over there.

165
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:07,560
And a kung fu grip.

166
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:09,366
- Lie down.
- Okay.

167
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:10,940
What kind of outfit is this, anyway?

168
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:13,476
It's not regular Army,
based on all the accents.

169
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:15,937
You're British.
What are you, French North African?

170
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:17,570
Morocco. Where were you born?

171
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:19,876
Duke wasn't born.
He was government-issued.

172
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,817
- What about you?
- He doesn't speak.

173
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,888
- Why?
- He doesn't say.

174
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:27,947
He doesn't say.
So, somehow you're all in the same unit,

175
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:29,890
but one you can't tell me
the name of, right?

176
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,256
We'd get tossed for telling.

177
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:34,263
You're gonna go after those guys
that hit my convoy, huh?

178
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,067
Well, whoever you are
and whatever this unit is,

179
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:41,502
I want in.

180
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:17,869
General.

181
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:19,576
- What's up, girl?
- Good job, Joes.

182
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,043
Outstanding.

183
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:24,679
Welcome to the Pit, Duke.
I've read a lot about you two.

184
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:26,945
Well, you can't believe
everything you read. See, I actually...

185
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:29,851
I understand we even tried to recruit you
a few years back.

186
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:32,322
- I never got asked to join any Op group.
- Really?

187
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,791
You don't remember Thailand
about 4 years ago?

188
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,953
Right before you broke up that bar?

189
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:38,655
About 4 years ago,
my boy had issues.

190
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:40,096
I mean, his issues had issues.

191
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,958
I've been in the military my entire life

192
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:45,469
and I have never seen
a tac operation like this.

193
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:48,439
All right, you trusted me,
I guess I'll trust you.

194
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:51,669
Technically, G.I. Joe does not exist,
but if it did,

195
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:53,939
it'd be comprised
of the top men and women

196
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:57,539
from the best military units in the world,
the alpha dogs.

197
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:01,514
When all else fails, we don't.

198
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:05,157
10 nations signed on in our first year,

199
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:08,285
working together, sharing intel.
Now we have 23.

200
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:12,427
- What's that?
- Camouflage suit.

201
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:15,535
It photographs everything behind you
and puts it in front of you.

202
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:20,799
- Mr. McCullen is standing by, sir.
- Patch him through via TelePresence.

203
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:22,604
- So who hit us?
- Currently unknown.

204
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,937
But one thing's for sure,

205
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:26,604
she's got highly classified intel
and state-of-the-art weaponry,

206
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:28,544
which means there's a whole
hell of a lot of money behind her.

207
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:31,210
Their capabilities are beyond anything
we've ever encountered.

208
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,288
Yeah, that's the one and only reason
why we got our asses kicked out there.

209
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,687
We need to find out
everything we can about her.

210
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,486
Knowing is half the battle.

211
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:42,923
Gentlemen, Mr. McCullen,

212
00:16:43,364 --> 00:16:46,697
CEO of MARS Industries
and the builder of these warheads.

213
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:49,565
General, clearly you were the
security option I should have chosen.

214
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:53,438
What did you just say? My team
did everything we could out there,

215
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:56,408
- and a lot of good men went down.
- Yeah, but not you.

216
00:16:56,511 --> 00:17:00,140
That mission was classified,
so clearly someone sold us out.

217
00:17:00,248 --> 00:17:04,117
I spent 10 years and 13 billion euros
creating these 4 warheads.

218
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,882
Your job, Captain, was to protect them,

219
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:09,617
and if it wasn't for General Hawk,
you'd have failed.

220
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:13,388
That's not a fair assessment.
He followed his orders to the letter.

221
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:15,861
Well, that wasn't enough.

222
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,934
Now, so the bastards who attacked you
can't find you,

223
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:21,559
you need to disable
the tracking beacon hidden in the case.

224
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,572
- We already have.
- Good man.

225
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:27,836
But allow me to check them
to see if any have been damaged.

226
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:37,878
Open it, please.

227
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:40,456
My scan says they're intact, sir.

228
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:44,857
- What's the code?
-5-2-9-4-4-0.

229
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:11,552
Please keep me informed
of your progress, General.

230
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:17,651
Breaker?

231
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:21,562
My voice analyzer on that guy
was going up, down and sideways.

232
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,067
Looks like McCullen's working an angle
he don't want us to catch.

233
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:28,430
We're on a deadline.
We need those warheads now!

234
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,531
You knew that!
10 years setting this up,

235
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:35,544
wringing money out of NATO,
this was supposed to be the easy part.

236
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:38,514
If you had let me stage the assault
at your precious factory,

237
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,777
I could have contained the situation.

238
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,410
And lost the trust of our clients
in the process.

239
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,614
It had to be NATO's fault!

240
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,161
What happened?

241
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,990
- Did you hesitate when you saw him?
- No.

242
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,800
This had nothing to do with him.

243
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,733
Forgive my jealousy.

244
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,809
Have you tracked the case?

245
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,678
They, of course,
deactivated the homing beacon.

246
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,083
I gave them a code
to quietly reactivate it.

247
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:19,880
It's in Egypt.
The Pit, only mentioned in whispers.

248
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,087
I will get those warheads back.

249
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,020
I hope so.

250
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,300
If I were really there,
I might actually let you touch me.

251
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:35,932
- I'll send a jet.
- Business first.

252
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,909
Besides, I'm married, remember?

253
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:44,081
If you had sent me in the first place,
it would already be done.

254
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:48,851
I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.
No more mistakes.

255
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,924
The schedule mustn't be compromised
any further.

256
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,051
Keep your eye on her for me.

257
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:58,564
American politics,
governors, senators, congressmen.

258
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,394
No wonder nothing ever gets done.

259
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,833
That's what we're going to fix,
Mr. Zartan.

260
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:34,627
The king cobra, magnificent creature.

261
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:38,069
Nature's Grim Reaper
and symbol of lethal purpose.

262
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:40,573
Unseen until it strikes.

263
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:44,102
Its venom can kill a full-grown elephant
with a single bite.

264
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:47,410
- Very nice.
- So far we've created 20 Neo-Vipers.

265
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:50,314
-19 stand before you.
- Is it working?

266
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:55,549
We injected 1,000 cc of
the nanomite solution into each subject.

267
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:58,354
When they finally stopped screaming,

268
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:00,452
brain scans showed
a complete inactivity

269
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:02,690
of the self-preservation region
of the cortex.

270
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:04,163
English, Doctor?

271
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:09,698
They feel no fear.

272
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:16,969
Cortical nerve clusters
show complete inactivity.

273
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:23,077
They feel no pain.
Concepts of morality are disengaged.

274
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:27,121
They feel no regrets, no remorse.

275
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,055
The nanomites join together
as a fighting mechanism,

276
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:37,827
first blocking, then expelling
the cobra's venom.

277
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,466
And they're completely obedient?

278
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:47,907
Of course.

279
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,181
The real-world applications are endless.

280
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,446
So, you tell me, is it working?

281
00:21:57,654 --> 00:22:00,623
Send a team to rendezvous
with Storm Shadow and the Baroness.

282
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:04,991
Consider it done.
The Joes will never know what hit them.

283
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:11,525
The 20th Neo-Viper is already set up
in Washington, DC

284
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:12,830
and awaiting your signal.

285
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:16,168
You've done well. You've thrown
the caber clear out of the yard.

286
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:19,175
Construction of the presidential bunker
has also been completed.

287
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:21,745
Now, if we sold one warhead
on the black market,

288
00:22:21,846 --> 00:22:23,108
I could continue my research.

289
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:25,206
I appreciate your thirst
for knowledge, Doctor,

290
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:27,614
but this world is messy enough. No.

291
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:32,248
What it needs is unification, leadership.

292
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:37,886
It has to be taken out of chaos
by someone with complete control.

293
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:43,361
Beijing, Moscow, Washington...

294
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:45,463
When these missiles detonate,

295
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:48,631
the world will turn
to the most powerful man on the planet.

296
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:53,508
When I'm finished,
the money will take care of itself.

297
00:22:53,612 --> 00:22:56,639
You'll be able to do
all the research you want.

298
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:05,913
We grabbed this image
from one of our tactical cameras.

299
00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:08,789
Now we're running her face
through an infinity scan.

300
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,620
Hey, isn't that...

301
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:16,258
We have access to any photograph
on any server, anywhere in the world.

302
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:19,532
Yep. Everyone gets photographed
in some way at some time.

303
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,800
Football game, ATM machine, airport...

304
00:23:21,908 --> 00:23:25,036
We'll find her,
and then we'll find out who sent her.

305
00:23:25,144 --> 00:23:27,408
- From NATO, sir.
- Are you okay?

306
00:23:28,415 --> 00:23:30,042
What happened to her?

307
00:23:31,684 --> 00:23:35,450
Well, it appears that I've been made
official custodian of the warheads.

308
00:23:35,555 --> 00:23:37,580
Looks like your mission
is complete here, Duke.

309
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,285
When you move them, she's gonna
come after you. You know that, right?

310
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:43,056
And with her intel and toys,
she'll find you.

311
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:44,163
What's your point?

312
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:46,960
You're going after her first
and we want in.

313
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:50,093
General, it was our team that got wasted
out there. We deserve payback.

314
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:53,935
You don't ask to be part of G.I. Joe.
You get asked.

315
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:58,374
You scouted me 4 years ago.
Now I'm ready. Let's have at it.

316
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,277
Well, I've lost men, too, Captain.

317
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:02,009
- If you want revenge...
- I know her.

318
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:03,116
Excuse me?

319
00:24:03,217 --> 00:24:05,845
You said
knowing's half the battle, right?

320
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:07,887
Well, I know who she is.

321
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:10,984
She was a blonde.
Her name is Ana Lewis.

322
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:13,458
I could tell you everything
you need to know about her,

323
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:15,256
up until the last 4 years.

324
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:17,627
After that, obviously,
a lot of things have changed.

325
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,376
Finally, my wife is home.

326
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:46,860
Hello, Daniel. How was your meeting
with the Minister of Defense?

327
00:24:46,962 --> 00:24:50,260
He was thrilled.
The accelerator performed flawlessly.

328
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,697
I wish you would have been there.

329
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:55,066
You and your little lab rats
are so clever.

330
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:57,799
- How was Monte Carlo?
- I didn't get what I was after.

331
00:24:57,907 --> 00:25:00,603
- I suppose I should be grateful.
- Most husbands would be.

332
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,577
Most husbands don't have
such mysterious wives.

333
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,909
They know exactly where they are
and what they do.

334
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:07,277
They think they know.

335
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:10,546
Ana, I don't wanna fight. I missed you.

336
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:12,985
Well, I never tire of a good fight.

337
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:18,850
But not with you, darling. Let me
freshen up and I'll meet you downstairs.

338
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:22,021
I do love you, my beautiful Baroness.

339
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:32,437
McCullen gave me orders to kill
the Baron if he so much as touched you.

340
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:35,375
Well, he's my husband.
Of course he touches me.

341
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:38,880
And besides, his work at the lab goes
much better after we've touched.

342
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:40,916
And that's the important thing.

343
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:43,781
So what are you doing? Spying on me?

344
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:48,417
If I was spying on you,
you would never know.

345
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:53,418
Getting closer.

346
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:56,099
You were my best student.

347
00:25:57,935 --> 00:26:00,631
I'll be coming with you
to retrieve the warheads.

348
00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:02,205
We go at dawn.

349
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,095
Come on, Ana.

350
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:33,796
Okay, so, I've been wanting to do this
before we deploy.

351
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:45,181
Duke, it's beautiful. It's too beautiful.

352
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:48,151
I'm only going to buy one of these,
so why not?

353
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:52,414
So what do you say?

354
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:55,323
Say yes, you idiot.
He's a real American hero.

355
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:56,519
Thanks for ruining the mood, Rex.

356
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:58,960
I apologize. I just came to offer you
a ride back to post.

357
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:00,793
What? It's time already?

358
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,698
- Yeah, we got to go at 0500.
- Is it...

359
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:07,132
Yeah, it is, right? That's why
you're pulling Rex out of the lab.

360
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,540
- Ana, look, I'm sorry, but I can't...
- Yeah, yeah, classified, top secret,

361
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:13,202
you'd have to kill me if you told me,
blah-blah-blah.

362
00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:17,307
And speaking of classified information,
you still haven't answered me.

363
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:22,179
Yes. Yes. Of course it's yes.

364
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:24,982
On one condition.

365
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:29,126
You have to promise me
that you will not let my genius,

366
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:31,197
egghead brother get hurt.

367
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:34,198
He's the only family I've got left.

368
00:27:35,302 --> 00:27:37,202
Promise me, Duke.

369
00:27:37,304 --> 00:27:38,635
I promise.

370
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:44,710
- Hey! My 3 favorite people.
- Mr. Weems. Good, man?

371
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,040
- Yeah.
- Look.

372
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:49,843
Wow. Nice rock. That's a lot of love.

373
00:27:50,718 --> 00:27:52,515
- Are you proposing?
- I'm actually done proposing.

374
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,057
- I already said yes.
- Oh, my God! Congratulations!

375
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:59,615
Beautiful! You guys are like the little
white couple on the wedding cake.

376
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:02,120
How cute. Give me some love.

377
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:05,427
Congratulations. Wait. It's not official.

378
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:07,468
- What?
- It's not official.

379
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:10,197
- Not until you answer my question.
- Okay.

380
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:13,034
Do you love my boy?

381
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,741
Always and forever.

382
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:25,080
You may have blackmailed
your way onto this team.

383
00:28:25,186 --> 00:28:27,051
Doesn't mean I've got to like it.

384
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,456
But it does mean
I've gotta get you mission ready,

385
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,156
Joe style.

386
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,962
Standing in front of you
are Delta-6 Accelerator suits.

387
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:38,966
- What does it accelerate?
- You.

388
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:43,004
It'll make you run faster, jump higher
and hit harder than any of your enemies.

389
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,870
Let's suit up.

390
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:49,137
Head-to-toe hydraulics
and highly pressurized pneumatics.

391
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:54,382
An advanced cybernetics
heads-up display helmet,

392
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,212
which feeds into the suit.

393
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,287
You think it, it does it.

394
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:02,721
Twin gas-propelled grappling spears

395
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:05,885
and triple-explosive,
heat-seeking, fire-and-forget rockets.

396
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,622
And my personal favorite,

397
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,563
a 10-millimeter caseless
Gatling submachine gun,

398
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:14,899
capable of firing 50 rounds per second.
Fully self-contained firepower.

399
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,098
Perfect for a couple of cowboys like you.

400
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:21,203
I just missed everything you said.
Hey, how do I look?

401
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:22,801
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Any questions?

402
00:29:40,097 --> 00:29:41,257
Yo, Sergeant Stone.

403
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:44,062
- Are they Joes?
- Hell, no. They're jokes.

404
00:29:44,636 --> 00:29:45,694
Boys.

405
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:48,095
You're gonna need these.

406
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:57,348
Just so you know,
when I get a target in my sights,

407
00:29:58,116 --> 00:29:59,606
I take it down.

408
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:01,645
Oh, shit!

409
00:30:04,523 --> 00:30:06,252
- Again.
- Again?

410
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,670
Just so you know, some targets
are harder to hit than others.

411
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,510
- Again.
- You're gonna need that helmet.

412
00:30:44,963 --> 00:30:46,658
Stand down, Snake Eyes.

413
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:48,734
All right. Walk away. It's over.
This ain't pay-per-view.

414
00:30:53,673 --> 00:30:55,037
I'm nasty with it!

415
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,164
You missed one.

416
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:58,176
Come on. That gotta be
some kind of a record or something.

417
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:00,906
- The record is all 20 killed.
- Who did that? Let me guess.

418
00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:03,539
- Snake Eyes?
- No. Me.

419
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,711
If you're gonna shoot at something,
kill it. Otherwise, take up knitting.

420
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:18,091
Beginner's luck. Stay focused.

421
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:26,469
- Again.
- Again?

422
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,010
I have never seen Snake Eyes take a hit.

423
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:37,241
They're Joes.

424
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:39,744
Maybe.

425
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,486
Let's go.

426
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:52,326
Hey, man, Breaker told me that Scarlett
graduated college at 12 years old.

427
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,828
She's like some freaky little
deadly genius.

428
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:57,301
- Rip. I get it, Rip. You like her.
- Sorry, my bad.

429
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:04,101
- To hell with it.
- Rip. Rip.

430
00:32:06,782 --> 00:32:09,273
Into the valley of death rode the 600.

431
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:11,978
Hey, what are you doing?
A little beach reading?

432
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:14,779
Okay.

433
00:32:16,858 --> 00:32:20,555
Look, I think you and me
got off on the wrong foot.

434
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:25,727
See, I'm attracted to you.
And you, you're attracted to me.

435
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:27,761
And him, the damn Zen master,

436
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,700
he creeps me out.
What I'm trying to say is...

437
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:32,273
- We're attracted to each other.
- Thank you!

438
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:35,071
That's what you're saying.
It's not what I'm saying.

439
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:36,871
It's not?

440
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,709
So, what are you saying?

441
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,279
Attraction is an emotion.
Emotions are not based in science.

442
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:50,189
And if you can't quantify
or prove that something exists, well,

443
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:52,193
in my mind, it doesn't.

444
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:55,957
Okay. I'll get back to you on that one.

445
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:59,101
Attention! General on deck!

446
00:32:59,203 --> 00:33:01,602
At ease. Duke,

447
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:05,196
you scored in the top half percent
of all people we've ever tested.

448
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:09,540
Rip, if we average your scores
with Duke's, you pass, too.

449
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:11,412
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

450
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:13,847
- Provisionally, of course.
- Thank you, sir.

451
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:36,700
Sir, sensors detecting seismic activity
to the southwest.

452
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,502
Probably just a tremor,
but have a team check it.

453
00:34:26,926 --> 00:34:28,757
There's our little weapons case.

454
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:31,830
All right. You 3, guard the machines.

455
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,455
- Sorry to disturb you, sir.
- That's all right, Corporal.

456
00:35:02,562 --> 00:35:06,363
I need you to sign here, here and here.
And also here, here...

457
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:19,540
Goodbye, sweetheart.

458
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:27,412
That's right. You don't kill women.

459
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:30,046
For you, Zartan, I'd make an exception.

460
00:35:58,487 --> 00:36:00,045
Warheads, Rip! Come on!

461
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,486
Go, go!

462
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:13,033
We've got the warheads.
Prep the Mole Pods for evac.

463
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:15,262
- We're on our way.
- We're already on it.

464
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:34,218
- Now how do we get out of here?
- Follow me.

465
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,356
Like that's gonna happen.

466
00:36:49,238 --> 00:36:51,433
Find the control room.
Open the exterior hatch.

467
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,476
- And secure this area.
- We're on it.

468
00:36:58,448 --> 00:36:59,540
Clear.

469
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,486
Go, go!

470
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:17,867
- Can you fly one of these things?
- Don't move! Ana, put the case down.

471
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:21,070
Fine. Done.

472
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,643
Stop. Ana, stop right there.

473
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,303
- You can't shoot me, can you?
- I will if I have to.

474
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,108
Deep down, you're still the same man
I fell in love with.

475
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:34,777
- Don't force this.
- What could have been. Right, Duke?

476
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,186
Just give me the case, God damn it.

477
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:43,352
- Move and I'm gonna blow her away.
- Do it. You already killed me once.

478
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,457
Duke, watch out!

479
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,135
Ana, drop the case!

480
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:14,852
Hello, brother.

481
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:42,613
Damn!

482
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:48,822
Eat this!

483
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,251
Hey, genius!

484
00:40:28,298 --> 00:40:29,629
See you, Duke.

485
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:01,498
- How many warheads?
-4, Mr. President.

486
00:41:01,598 --> 00:41:04,761
- Any threats? Demands?
- None so far, sir.

487
00:41:04,868 --> 00:41:06,836
We take this to mean
the terrorists are unfocused.

488
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:08,837
- No clear goals.
- No.

489
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:12,298
It means they intend to use them.

490
00:41:13,544 --> 00:41:15,068
General Hawk is stable now,

491
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:17,511
but he won't be conscious
for another day or so.

492
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:19,343
He's one tough bastard.

493
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:32,588
Hey.

494
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,463
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

495
00:41:38,203 --> 00:41:41,037
- I didn't want anyone to see me like this.
- Why?

496
00:41:42,241 --> 00:41:44,299
I don't know. All the men we lost,
General Hawk wounded,

497
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:46,036
my neck just doesn't seem important.

498
00:41:46,144 --> 00:41:50,137
You almost lost your life out there.
You have a reason to be concerned.

499
00:41:52,451 --> 00:41:54,544
First fight I lost since I was a kid.

500
00:41:56,355 --> 00:41:58,380
My father taught me to win.

501
00:41:58,491 --> 00:42:04,157
Look, I don't see how you could teach
anybody to win everything every time.

502
00:42:06,198 --> 00:42:07,631
I mean, look at you.

503
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,590
You're still here, right?

504
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,435
You get knocked down, you get back up.

505
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,698
Maybe that's
what he wanted you to learn.

506
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:20,110
But then again,
that would be an emotional response,

507
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:22,874
one that can't be explained or quantified.

508
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,131
Hey. Looks like we're all
seeing ghosts today, huh?

509
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:23,033
Storm Shadow!

510
00:44:27,006 --> 00:44:30,134
English, Storm Shadow.
Where are your manners?

511
00:44:30,509 --> 00:44:31,942
He is hungry.

512
00:44:32,344 --> 00:44:36,372
We need to invite him in
and show him the path.

513
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,842
- He is a cur, a weakling!
- He does not fight like one.

514
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:48,757
Now, what shall we call you?

515
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:57,333
This belonged to an ancestor of mine.

516
00:44:58,104 --> 00:45:00,504
He was caught selling arms
to both sides.

517
00:45:00,607 --> 00:45:03,804
The French forced him to wear it
for the rest of his life.

518
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,403
They called him Destro,
destroyer of nations.

519
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:09,381
So why do you keep it?

520
00:45:09,482 --> 00:45:12,144
So that I never forget
the most important rule in dealing arms.

521
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:14,812
Let me guess. Never sell to both sides?

522
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,390
Never get caught selling to both sides.

523
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:22,692
Take the warheads to Paris.
Have them weaponized.

524
00:45:22,797 --> 00:45:24,923
- Then I want you to test one.
- Test one?

525
00:45:25,031 --> 00:45:27,728
We'll let CNN show the world
how well they perform.

526
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,229
Fear is a great motivator.

527
00:45:34,642 --> 00:45:38,739
I have a target in mind,
one the French will never forget,

528
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:42,913
as I've never forgotten
what they did to Clan McCullen.

529
00:45:52,828 --> 00:45:55,763
- Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?
- Born ready, Doctor.

530
00:45:55,864 --> 00:45:57,831
This is going to be
the achievement of a lifetime.

531
00:45:57,932 --> 00:46:00,902
Yes, as a master of disguise,
you have no equal, my friend.

532
00:46:01,003 --> 00:46:04,939
18 months of studying my target,
learning mannerisms,

533
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,837
but the devil is in the details.

534
00:46:06,942 --> 00:46:09,707
Gentlemen, let's get it going.

535
00:46:09,812 --> 00:46:11,006
One more thing.

536
00:46:11,114 --> 00:46:13,707
I'll control my own brain,
thank you very much.

537
00:46:17,185 --> 00:46:18,516
Let's do this.

538
00:46:37,407 --> 00:46:40,934
- Wow. That was a bit nasty.
- Think so?

539
00:46:42,212 --> 00:46:43,872
Let's run some tests.

540
00:46:45,515 --> 00:46:51,511
Eye color. Skin tone. Hair follicles.

541
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:55,856
And initiating facial reconstruction tests.

542
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:08,232
We gotta find out
who's holding their leash.

543
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:11,796
With their weaponry, financing
and intel, these guys are high-line pros.

544
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:13,605
That limits the possibilities.

545
00:47:13,712 --> 00:47:17,010
- Hey, the weapons case.
- What?

546
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:18,706
Remember, McCullen had us
open the weapons case?

547
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:20,511
- What about it?
- I bet you he gave us a code

548
00:47:20,617 --> 00:47:22,778
that reactivated the tracking beacon.

549
00:47:22,886 --> 00:47:26,379
You're right.
McCullen, that son of a bitch.

550
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:28,857
So, McCullen uses NATO
to fund his R&D

551
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,621
and then he steals the warheads back.

552
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:35,393
- And who says you're not a thinker?
- Hey, I found her.

553
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:37,899
Yeah, that's her all right.

554
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:41,904
Her name is Ana de Cobray.
Baroness, if you're feeling formal.

555
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:45,534
Baroness? Wow, she really traded up.
Financially, of course.

556
00:47:45,644 --> 00:47:47,702
- Who's he?
- Daniel de Cobray.

557
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:50,542
Big shot French scientist.
Runs a lab in Paris.

558
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:53,583
- Lab? What kind of lab?
- Particle accelerator.

559
00:47:54,853 --> 00:47:58,255
Oh, my God. They're going to use him
to weaponize the warheads.

560
00:47:59,158 --> 00:48:01,149
Well, that's where she's going.

561
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,420
I like croissants.

562
00:48:34,127 --> 00:48:36,856
- Go, go, go!
- Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

563
00:48:37,062 --> 00:48:38,552
Pull up on the truck!

564
00:48:42,235 --> 00:48:43,668
Go, go, go!

565
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:47,865
-2 o'clock!
- Go, go, go!

566
00:48:47,974 --> 00:48:49,305
Go, let's move!

567
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:55,040
- In the alley!
- Get down, get down!

568
00:48:55,148 --> 00:48:56,445
You see them?

569
00:48:58,785 --> 00:49:01,846
-2 more on the left!
- Get down!

570
00:49:01,956 --> 00:49:04,424
Dubble Bubble? It always helps me.

571
00:49:06,126 --> 00:49:08,686
Yeah. Hey, you good?

572
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:10,827
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

573
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,529
All right, Mr. Science Officer,
you're up, okay?

574
00:49:15,636 --> 00:49:17,536
You don't find it in 4 minutes,
you get out of there.

575
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:21,631
That house will not be there in 5.
I already called for the air strike.

576
00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:23,073
Come on! Here we go!

577
00:49:25,847 --> 00:49:27,712
I got you! Go, go, go!

578
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:31,445
Oh, crap!

579
00:49:34,756 --> 00:49:35,950
Rooftop!

580
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:40,787
Hey, Duke, I gotta level with you.

581
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:44,229
- I hate it when you level with me.
- It's going to be a long 5 minutes.

582
00:49:49,972 --> 00:49:53,169
No, no, no! It's too early. It's too early!

583
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:56,470
- Duke!
- Rex! Rex!

584
00:50:16,532 --> 00:50:17,658
Rex.

585
00:50:21,638 --> 00:50:23,572
Duke! Come on. We gotta go.

586
00:50:23,673 --> 00:50:25,163
- I gotta get Rex.
- We gotta go, man!

587
00:50:25,274 --> 00:50:28,073
Black Hawk's waiting! We gotta go!
Nothing you can do!

588
00:50:28,177 --> 00:50:30,145
- Nothing you can do, man! Come on!
- I gotta get Rex.

589
00:50:35,184 --> 00:50:37,779
Ready. Aim. Fire.

590
00:50:38,656 --> 00:50:40,283
Forward, march.

591
00:51:33,578 --> 00:51:35,705
Are you going to sign in or shall I?

592
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:01,196
Ana?

593
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:04,370
Who is this?

594
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:06,544
Hey! What are you doing?

595
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:08,579
- What's going on here?
- I need you to do something for me

596
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:10,512
and I don't have much time.

597
00:52:11,217 --> 00:52:12,946
What are these things?

598
00:52:13,052 --> 00:52:14,452
They're warheads, dear.

599
00:52:14,554 --> 00:52:18,216
And I need you to weaponize them
for me, or we'll kill everyone in here.

600
00:52:20,259 --> 00:52:23,023
Hey! This is a civilian laboratory!

601
00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:26,426
We don't have the correct
programming protocols for weaponizing!

602
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:30,629
The protocols are in the case.
I told you, I don't have much time.

603
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:44,680
Hey, is that Dubble Bubble?

604
00:52:45,285 --> 00:52:46,446
But it's my last piece.

605
00:52:47,355 --> 00:52:50,050
- Come on, give it to me.
- All right, there you go.

606
00:52:50,157 --> 00:52:53,092
All right. Stick to the plan.
Scarlett, Snake Eyes, take the front.

607
00:52:53,193 --> 00:52:55,684
Rip, Duke, take the back.
Breaker will be our eyes and ears.

608
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:57,025
I'll give the orders from here.

609
00:52:57,131 --> 00:52:59,895
- You do what I say, when I say. Got it?
- Yes, Daddy.

610
00:53:48,484 --> 00:53:49,678
Here.

611
00:53:50,386 --> 00:53:52,512
- They're all alive.
- Merci, Daniel.

612
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,940
I told you I'd kill him
if he touched you again.

613
00:54:13,309 --> 00:54:15,300
I heard you the first time.

614
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:23,915
Okay, we're almost there.
Scarlett, you better put your suit on.

615
00:54:34,165 --> 00:54:35,462
That's her.

616
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:44,336
Take that Hummer, Snake!

617
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:10,925
Careful.
They're worth millions of dollars each.

618
00:55:11,035 --> 00:55:12,662
Millions of dollars. Got it.

619
00:55:14,004 --> 00:55:17,600
- Jesus.
- My bad. My bad. Won't happen again!

620
00:55:21,112 --> 00:55:22,511
Thanks a lot, buddy!

621
00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:26,405
Come on, Scarlett, babe. You in or out?
We gotta get in this fight!

622
00:55:38,064 --> 00:55:41,363
Tracking signal is good.
Don't let go of that truck, Snake Eyes.

623
00:56:14,533 --> 00:56:16,228
Let's get that bastard off the roof.

624
00:56:45,399 --> 00:56:46,696
Look out!

625
00:56:50,103 --> 00:56:51,661
Hey, Heavy, it's getting thick out here!

626
00:56:51,772 --> 00:56:54,173
Yeah, I know. They're driving
right into the heaviest traffic.

627
00:56:54,275 --> 00:56:55,799
What kind of escape route is that?

628
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,902
Maybe they're not trying to escape.
Maybe they're heading somewhere.

629
00:56:59,013 --> 00:57:00,810
- Possible target?
- Yes.

630
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:06,981
Some place with a lot of metal.

631
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:14,361
- They're going to blow it up. All units!
- Guys, you have to stop them!

632
00:57:14,463 --> 00:57:15,862
Yeah, we're working on it.

633
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:17,064
I mean right now!

634
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:19,929
They're going to detonate one
of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower!

635
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:54,895
Crush him!

636
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:57,266
Snake!

637
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,704
He's underneath. Kill him!

638
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,462
That redhead is really starting
to piss me off.

639
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,123
Shit!

640
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,429
Oh, God!

641
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,768
I got you. I got you.

642
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:32,232
- Nice save, slick.
- Come on,

643
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:34,903
don't start being all nice to me now.
Gotta go.

644
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:40,743
Get in!

645
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:47,724
All right, Rip, let's take this thing down!
Hang on, Snake!

646
00:58:56,634 --> 00:58:58,829
Try this on for size, boys.

647
00:59:13,718 --> 00:59:14,878
Oh, shit!

648
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:35,263
We lost them!

649
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:37,133
Cut through that building
across the street.

650
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:38,835
- Where's the door?
- Make one!

651
00:59:38,945 --> 00:59:40,571
Right! Come on, Rip!

652
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,443
I'm coming. I'm coming!

653
00:59:44,717 --> 00:59:46,685
I don't have them! Where are they?

654
01:00:09,009 --> 01:00:11,602
- They're evacuating the Tower.
- We're only 2 kilometers away.

655
01:00:11,711 --> 01:00:13,804
Snake, we're running out of time.
You gotta do something.

656
01:00:13,913 --> 01:00:15,210
It's now or never.

657
01:00:24,758 --> 01:00:27,750
- He gave up.
- He never gives up.

658
01:00:40,742 --> 01:00:41,936
Coming through!

659
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:06,265
Okay, that was crazy.
I didn't expect that.

660
01:01:07,368 --> 01:01:09,803
- What happened to you?
- I went through the train.

661
01:01:09,905 --> 01:01:12,373
- What happened to you?
- I jumped over it.

662
01:01:12,808 --> 01:01:15,833
- You can do that?
- Yeah. I told you to read that manual.

663
01:01:15,944 --> 01:01:17,377
There's a manual?

664
01:01:21,517 --> 01:01:23,985
Next time, I'll drive.

665
01:01:37,032 --> 01:01:39,262
Here. Take the kill switch.

666
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:51,136
Come on. Get out of the way!

667
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,911
Hey, guys, they're alive
and they're on the move.

668
01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:59,284
And they've activated the warhead.
I'm tracking the kill switch now.

669
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:01,983
Duke! Duke, it's on the Baroness!

670
01:02:02,091 --> 01:02:04,617
Storm Shadow has one of the warheads,
and it's armed!

671
01:02:15,439 --> 01:02:18,066
Get out of my way! Get out!

672
01:02:19,075 --> 01:02:20,508
Get out!

673
01:02:21,778 --> 01:02:22,802
Nice shoes.

674
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,148
You get the warhead,
I'll get the kill switch.

675
01:02:35,258 --> 01:02:36,487
Yeah, I'm on it.

676
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:01,179
Damn, that ninja's fast!

677
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:05,679
No.

678
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:31,878
Oh, no!

679
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:46,791
- Bloody hell.
- No.

680
01:04:08,188 --> 01:04:09,552
They're gonna eat through
the entire city.

681
01:04:09,655 --> 01:04:11,418
Duke, you have to hit that kill switch!

682
01:04:43,824 --> 01:04:45,486
Oh, God.

683
01:05:08,284 --> 01:05:09,376
Disarmed.

684
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:25,399
Congratulations, Duke.
You just saved Paris.

685
01:05:28,304 --> 01:05:29,828
Or at least most of it.

686
01:05:59,803 --> 01:06:02,931
- Is that blood?
- Spaghetti sauce. Don't ask.

687
01:06:03,874 --> 01:06:05,739
- They got Duke.
- We know.

688
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:08,633
- What are you doing?
- Plugging into his cerebral cortex.

689
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:09,770
I hate to break the news to you,

690
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:12,145
but I don't think he's gonna
give you much in his dead condition.

691
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,115
The brain survives
a couple of minutes after death.

692
01:06:14,218 --> 01:06:16,845
We can retrieve the electrical impulses
from his most recent memories

693
01:06:16,953 --> 01:06:19,046
- and convert them to images.
- Well, can we find Duke?

694
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:20,714
We need to find
the other 3 warheads first.

695
01:06:20,825 --> 01:06:23,988
If this guy remembers his way home,
maybe we can find both.

696
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:28,026
Okay, here come the images.
Let's see where this guy's been.

697
01:06:33,604 --> 01:06:34,628
- He's still alive!
- He can't be.

698
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:35,797
He's got 3-inch needles in his head!

699
01:06:35,907 --> 01:06:39,001
- Hey, dead guys don't breakdance!
- What's happening, Breaker?

700
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:41,909
- Nanomites, they're eating him.
- Must be some sort of self-destruct.

701
01:06:42,014 --> 01:06:44,539
- Hurry, Breaker!
- Come on, come on, come on.

702
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:48,084
No. No!

703
01:06:50,254 --> 01:06:51,653
No, no, no!

704
01:06:53,392 --> 01:06:55,860
The beauty of nanotechnology.

705
01:06:57,529 --> 01:06:59,724
- We are screwed.
- Relax. I got everything I could.

706
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:01,958
What? Then what the hell was the,
"No, no, no, no!" for?

707
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:03,226
That was for McCullen.

708
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:06,031
- They were watching us.
- Okay. So what did you get?

709
01:07:06,138 --> 01:07:07,503
Actually, not that much. Just images.

710
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,506
Come on, Frenchie. I thought you said
you was the best at this.

711
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:10,905
- I am the best at this!
- All right.

712
01:07:11,009 --> 01:07:12,533
- Nobody can do what I just did.
- Okay.

713
01:07:15,148 --> 01:07:16,513
Wait, no.

714
01:07:17,016 --> 01:07:18,880
We didn't do it. We're the good guys.

715
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,348
- Put your hands up, Rip.
- We don't have time for this!

716
01:07:22,454 --> 01:07:24,183
We're not allowed to engage
with friendly forces.

717
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:27,191
They don't look too friendly to me.
I gotta get my boy.

718
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,158
- Look, Captain...
- Rip!

719
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,550
We're still trying to locate
the 3 remaining warheads, sir.

720
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:59,455
- What's the status of the Joes?
- They've been detained.

721
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:03,018
- The French are pretty upset.
- Of course they're upset.

722
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:06,164
Get me the French Ambassador.

723
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:17,506
...in a matter of seconds
by a strike by a missile...

724
01:08:17,611 --> 01:08:18,943
Hey, no, no!

725
01:08:20,215 --> 01:08:23,240
Please don't touch that!
That's my equipment. It's very...

726
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:26,145
Okay, he's touching it.

727
01:08:27,454 --> 01:08:29,548
- Nice going, slick.
- It's not his fault.

728
01:08:29,657 --> 01:08:31,750
He's just emotional.

729
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:34,420
- Here, let me look at that.
- I'm fine.

730
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:36,895
Just trying to help. General!

731
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:47,570
The French have agreed to let you all go
on the condition that none of you return.

732
01:08:48,743 --> 01:08:49,767
Ever.

733
01:08:49,878 --> 01:08:52,040
- Never?
- It could be worse.

734
01:08:52,148 --> 01:08:53,774
What do you mean by never?
Like, never, never, ever?

735
01:08:53,882 --> 01:08:55,349
There's more.

736
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:59,011
All of you have been recalled
by your respective heads of state.

737
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,521
Team Alpha is to return to the Pit.

738
01:09:02,892 --> 01:09:04,450
What about Duke?

739
01:09:11,366 --> 01:09:13,665
Call McCullen.
Tell him we have the 3 warheads.

740
01:09:13,769 --> 01:09:14,997
Right away.

741
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,508
Why didn't you just kill me?

742
01:09:19,608 --> 01:09:22,475
McCullen has something special
in mind for you.

743
01:09:22,578 --> 01:09:23,773
McCullen.

744
01:09:25,915 --> 01:09:27,439
What happened to you?

745
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:28,915
Now you care?

746
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:31,377
Okay.

747
01:09:32,755 --> 01:09:34,121
I am sorry.

748
01:09:35,325 --> 01:09:37,293
I'm sorry about Rex.

749
01:09:38,028 --> 01:09:40,622
I'm sorry that I couldn't bring Rex home.

750
01:09:41,564 --> 01:09:44,534
And I'm so sorry
that I couldn't face you afterwards.

751
01:09:46,002 --> 01:09:48,368
Well, everybody's sorry
about something.

752
01:10:56,108 --> 01:10:57,473
Master!

753
01:10:58,043 --> 01:10:59,238
Master.

754
01:11:20,934 --> 01:11:23,198
Okay, so what about Duke?
We're just gonna forget about him?

755
01:11:23,303 --> 01:11:24,497
We've got our orders.

756
01:11:24,604 --> 01:11:26,538
Look, man,
what if it was one of your guys?

757
01:11:26,639 --> 01:11:29,130
What if it was Scarlett or Breaker?
What would you do then?

758
01:11:29,242 --> 01:11:31,609
Looks pretty remote.
Might be a good location for a base.

759
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:34,475
Snow. That leaves us with what,
1/3 of the earth?

760
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:35,741
Yeah.

761
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:40,283
- Hey, is that McCullen's shadow?
- What you got?

762
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:42,753
- Spherical trigonometry.
- I must have missed that class.

763
01:11:42,856 --> 01:11:44,824
If you know the height of the object,
the length of the shadow,

764
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:46,358
and the time and date
that the image was captured,

765
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:48,654
- you can figure out its location.
- That's why I missed that class.

766
01:11:48,761 --> 01:11:50,524
All right, Breaker, give it to me.
What have we got?

767
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:55,830
Okay. McCullen is 180 centimeters tall.
His shadow is 46 centimeters.

768
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:57,665
This image has decayed 6%,

769
01:11:57,771 --> 01:12:01,138
which means
it's 51 hours and 17 minutes old.

770
01:12:01,675 --> 01:12:03,506
That's at the polar icecap.

771
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,135
- Heavy.
- Yep.

772
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,880
What do you say, sir?

773
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:10,212
I said you've been ordered back
to the Pit,

774
01:12:11,352 --> 01:12:14,516
but I didn't say when
and I didn't say which route to take.

775
01:12:17,659 --> 01:12:19,148
Maybe a northern one.

776
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:38,036
That is a lot of ice.

777
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:40,478
Thousands of miles across
and 10 stories thick.

778
01:12:40,582 --> 01:12:43,517
Locating McCullen's base will be
like finding a needle in a coal mine.

779
01:12:43,618 --> 01:12:45,643
- Haystack.
- Right.

780
01:12:46,121 --> 01:12:47,783
Haystack in a coal mine.

781
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,798
No! McCullen has plans for him!

782
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:47,277
Enough!

783
01:14:01,365 --> 01:14:02,890
And what was your plan?

784
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:05,935
Run 3,000 miles across the ice?

785
01:14:11,141 --> 01:14:12,632
Stupid soldier.

786
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:22,518
Move it.

787
01:14:22,988 --> 01:14:24,853
- That's strange.
- What?

788
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:27,885
When they stole the weapons case,
I set my scanner

789
01:14:27,992 --> 01:14:31,257
to look out for the tracking beacon
in case it came back on.

790
01:14:31,362 --> 01:14:34,127
- And it just came back on.
- That's my boy!

791
01:14:55,221 --> 01:14:56,245
3 left.

792
01:14:56,356 --> 01:15:00,121
Take the warheads to the missiles.
I want them ready to launch in one hour.

793
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:01,883
It will be done.

794
01:15:10,103 --> 01:15:12,071
My beautiful Lady of the Lake.

795
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:22,239
This bother you?

796
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:28,048
It's funny, isn't it? The entire balance
of power in the world about to shift,

797
01:15:28,155 --> 01:15:31,555
2 guys can still have a stare-down
over who gets the girl.

798
01:15:49,076 --> 01:15:51,203
I'm gonna make you very unhappy.

799
01:15:51,312 --> 01:15:53,280
- I'm already unhappy.
- Get up!

800
01:16:05,626 --> 01:16:08,220
Video from the Aqua Cam
is coming online now.

801
01:16:08,762 --> 01:16:10,196
Bloody hell.

802
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:13,558
They've built a military base
under the polar icecap.

803
01:16:13,668 --> 01:16:16,569
It's the perfect location.
Nearly undetectable, easily defensible.

804
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:19,230
- Duke's got to be in there somewhere.
- And the warheads.

805
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:21,434
We have to find a quiet way
to get inside.

806
01:16:23,945 --> 01:16:26,709
Elevator cables.
They've got a surface entrance.

807
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:31,047
Guys, there's something else.
Going to sonar view.

808
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:34,051
They've got tunnels
running through the ice pack.

809
01:16:34,155 --> 01:16:36,419
Hey, look, they've got
their own attack subs.

810
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:38,015
Okay, what's that?

811
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:40,788
- Missile tubes.
- Must be for the nanomite warheads.

812
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:44,162
Take us up. I'll create a distraction
from outside and keep them busy

813
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:46,861
while you lot infiltrate the facility
from above. We'll find Duke...

814
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,492
- Grab the warheads.
- Kill all the bad guys.

815
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:52,601
As you all know,
Team Alpha is under direct orders

816
01:16:52,707 --> 01:16:55,142
to return to their
respective national bases.

817
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:59,271
But I have something I need to do
which goes against all orders.

818
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:02,979
So, if any of you decide
that you have to leave now,

819
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,849
I will certainly not hold it against you.

820
01:17:15,866 --> 01:17:16,890
Okay, then.

821
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:19,261
What are you gonna do
with the warheads?

822
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:22,064
You take to your training well.
That's good.

823
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:23,934
Still trying to develop intel.

824
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,236
- So you won't mind telling me.
- Isn't it obvious?

825
01:17:26,343 --> 01:17:28,538
I'm a businessman.
I'm going to use them.

826
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:31,107
Millions of people are gonna die
if you launch those warheads,

827
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:32,238
so what is it that you want?

828
01:17:32,349 --> 01:17:36,479
To strike fear into the hearts of every
man, woman and child on the planet.

829
01:17:37,154 --> 01:17:39,384
Then they'll turn to the person
with the most power.

830
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:40,547
You?

831
01:17:41,224 --> 01:17:42,714
No, not me.

832
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:44,987
- You're not seeing the whole picture.
- Then tell me.

833
01:17:45,095 --> 01:17:47,121
I don't wanna spoil the surprise.

834
01:17:57,542 --> 01:17:58,542
Guests.

835
01:17:58,643 --> 01:18:01,476
Meet the genius
behind all my nanotechnology.

836
01:18:01,579 --> 01:18:04,309
Genius? You are too kind.

837
01:18:04,782 --> 01:18:07,909
As you can see,
we are loading my nanomite warheads

838
01:18:08,019 --> 01:18:09,850
into the high-V missiles.

839
01:18:09,954 --> 01:18:12,684
Once at maximum velocity, Mach 5,

840
01:18:13,057 --> 01:18:16,254
not even the Joes have
the technology to catch them.

841
01:18:16,361 --> 01:18:19,456
So, who's this? Another recruit?

842
01:18:20,466 --> 01:18:22,457
Albeit a rather unwilling one.

843
01:18:22,568 --> 01:18:25,001
I'll prepare him for the procedure.

844
01:18:46,225 --> 01:18:48,853
All teams, listen up,
this is General Hawk.

845
01:18:48,961 --> 01:18:52,056
The mission is a go.
I say again, the mission is a go.

846
01:18:52,766 --> 01:18:53,766
Good luck, Joes.

847
01:19:24,098 --> 01:19:26,657
- The teams have been deployed, sir.
- Get me a satellite uplink.

848
01:19:26,766 --> 01:19:29,234
I wanna see everything
that's going on down there.

849
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:43,242
You picking up anything?

850
01:19:43,349 --> 01:19:45,716
Negative.
There's nothing on the scanner.

851
01:19:58,332 --> 01:20:00,061
- Nice shooting.
- Thank you.

852
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:03,698
We're a long way from Miami.

853
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:07,973
That's a Night Raven.
They actually built one.

854
01:20:08,076 --> 01:20:10,636
Looks fast.
That McCullen got some gadgets.

855
01:20:12,047 --> 01:20:17,485
MARS Industries manufactures
70% of all arms on this planet.

856
01:20:17,886 --> 01:20:19,581
70%.

857
01:20:20,655 --> 01:20:23,681
Did you know that, Duke?

858
01:20:24,292 --> 01:20:29,094
There are 2 sides to McCullen's operation,
the Sword and the Shield.

859
01:20:29,465 --> 01:20:31,932
The Sword creates and sells weaponry.

860
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:36,436
The Shield creates defensive
technology, like high-tech bunkers,

861
01:20:36,538 --> 01:20:38,598
which are supposed
to protect one from anything

862
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:41,609
from a nuclear blast
to a nanomite warhead.

863
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:45,942
Unfortunately, the bunker
in which I took shelter

864
01:20:46,047 --> 01:20:47,742
was just a prototype.

865
01:20:47,849 --> 01:20:49,283
Who are you?

866
01:21:01,998 --> 01:21:03,226
Rex?

867
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:06,927
You son of a bitch! Ana buried you!

868
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:09,470
Moving ceremony, I'm sure.

869
01:21:09,572 --> 01:21:11,632
The 3-volley salute.

870
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:14,734
Boots on the ground.
A folded flag in her arms.

871
01:21:14,845 --> 01:21:17,279
Why? Why didn't you just come in?

872
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:20,315
Because I discovered something.

873
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,852
...subject number 23.

874
01:21:27,724 --> 01:21:29,624
This will only hurt a little.

875
01:21:29,726 --> 01:21:32,127
What comes next, more so.

876
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:34,697
Listen, Mindbender,
do whatever it takes.

877
01:21:34,798 --> 01:21:36,265
So will I.

878
01:21:36,366 --> 01:21:39,631
Remember, science requires sacrifice.

879
01:21:40,904 --> 01:21:43,373
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Stay where you are!

880
01:21:44,809 --> 01:21:46,572
Are you going to shoot me?

881
01:21:48,913 --> 01:21:51,813
These aren't chemical or nuclear,
are they?

882
01:21:51,915 --> 01:21:53,075
No.

883
01:21:53,184 --> 01:21:55,482
They're something much, much better.

884
01:21:55,587 --> 01:21:56,952
It is beautiful.

885
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:01,322
Nanomites, it's beyond...

886
01:22:01,826 --> 01:22:04,261
It's light years ahead
of what anyone else is doing in the field.

887
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:06,453
Proximity alert.

888
01:22:06,564 --> 01:22:10,261
Aerial attack imminent.
All personnel to the bunker.

889
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,602
Come on. Come on! What?

890
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:20,042
What are you doing?
Don't close that. Don't...

891
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:24,744
If we live, I'll show you everything.

892
01:22:29,455 --> 01:22:33,357
We survived that blast, somewhat.

893
01:22:33,459 --> 01:22:37,759
And Dr. Mindbender and I escaped
with his research, which I perfected

894
01:22:37,863 --> 01:22:40,923
and which you will
now experience first-hand.

895
01:22:41,033 --> 01:22:43,297
Does Ana know about this? About you?

896
01:22:43,402 --> 01:22:45,962
No, and she never will.

897
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:50,099
Commence the launch sequence.

898
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:55,772
Commencing launch sequence.
T- minus 4, 3, 2, 1.

899
01:22:56,215 --> 01:22:57,649
Ignite primary engines.

900
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:00,811
We have ignition.

901
01:23:06,626 --> 01:23:08,423
They're launching the missiles!

902
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:47,964
We lost the Beijing missile.
Warhead 3 is down, sir.

903
01:23:48,069 --> 01:23:50,094
- Alert all defenses.
- Yes, sir.

904
01:23:50,204 --> 01:23:51,502
He's here.

905
01:24:03,118 --> 01:24:05,484
- What about the other two?
- We gotta find the kill switches.

906
01:24:05,587 --> 01:24:06,747
They're already way too far out of range.

907
01:24:06,855 --> 01:24:09,551
Somebody has to get up there
and shoot those things down.

908
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:12,957
Well, I guess that's me.

909
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:15,059
- Sir.
- What is it?

910
01:24:15,163 --> 01:24:17,097
STRATCOM is tracking 3 warheads

911
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,962
that have just launched off
the polar icecap.

912
01:24:19,067 --> 01:24:20,067
One was downed immediately.

913
01:24:20,168 --> 01:24:22,068
The other 2 are currently entering
the upper atmosphere.

914
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,604
We need to get you
down to the bunker, sir.

915
01:24:23,706 --> 01:24:26,368
Well, they haven't made any demands.
What's their plan?

916
01:24:28,744 --> 01:24:30,735
Now, this is very cool.

917
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:33,544
- Yeah, but can you fly it?
- I can fly anything.

918
01:24:33,648 --> 01:24:36,174
You just find a way
to guide me to those warheads.

919
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:38,549
- Right. Ripcord...
- Yeah?

920
01:24:41,457 --> 01:24:43,219
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

921
01:24:43,592 --> 01:24:45,322
- Hey, do me a favor.
- Yeah?

922
01:24:45,428 --> 01:24:47,487
- Save Duke.
- You got it.

923
01:24:57,074 --> 01:24:58,336
Let's go!

924
01:25:09,686 --> 01:25:11,984
The floor is pressure-plated
and laser-protected.

925
01:25:12,089 --> 01:25:15,285
Anything larger than a quarter
that touches that floor gets fried.

926
01:25:18,328 --> 01:25:22,526
You left me for dead, Duke,
and look at me.

927
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:26,294
Now you'll know what it's like
to be a monster.

928
01:25:33,744 --> 01:25:35,644
- We don't have much time.
- Ana?

929
01:25:45,523 --> 01:25:47,012
Oh, my God.

930
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:51,420
- Ana!
- Security, to the operating chamber!

931
01:25:51,529 --> 01:25:54,054
- Rex!
- I press this, she dies.

932
01:25:54,165 --> 01:25:57,396
- You did this to your own sister!
- I loved my sister.

933
01:25:57,502 --> 01:26:01,405
Do you have any idea the state
she was in with me dead, you gone?

934
01:26:02,707 --> 01:26:05,676
Have you ever felt truly alone?

935
01:26:06,611 --> 01:26:10,639
I gave her a way to deal with the pain.
I gave her purpose.

936
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:13,683
You could have stopped all of this
just by letting her know you were alive!

937
01:26:13,786 --> 01:26:15,981
Science requires sacrifice.

938
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:18,521
All she's done was because of you!

939
01:26:18,623 --> 01:26:21,718
And because of you, Duke.
You abandoned her.

940
01:26:21,827 --> 01:26:25,024
- Let's not forget that point.
- I'm gonna kill you, Rex.

941
01:26:29,668 --> 01:26:31,693
- Is she still alive?
- For now.

942
01:26:31,804 --> 01:26:34,466
I thought we had complete control.
You said this couldn't happen.

943
01:26:34,573 --> 01:26:35,597
I didn't think it could.

944
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:39,337
I've never seen anyone override
the programming, even momentarily.

945
01:26:39,445 --> 01:26:41,174
She did this for him.

946
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:45,342
The pain must have been excruciating.

947
01:26:53,894 --> 01:26:55,486
What you'll have to do

948
01:26:55,595 --> 01:26:59,258
is to rewire the laser panel's brain
by carefully...

949
01:27:01,034 --> 01:27:03,332
- Or you can just stab it.
- This is Scarlett. We're in.

950
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:05,262
Deploy the SHARCs!

951
01:27:06,039 --> 01:27:07,301
Detaching SHARCs 1-3...

952
01:27:07,407 --> 01:27:10,308
Detaching SHARCs
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta.

953
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:12,901
- Full speed ahead.
- Detaching SHARCs.

954
01:27:13,013 --> 01:27:16,415
SHARCs Victor, Franklin, Tango
into flanking positions.

955
01:27:16,517 --> 01:27:18,849
All right, boys. Attack formation.

956
01:27:32,266 --> 01:27:34,860
Fan out.
Wait until the Joes break formation.

957
01:27:35,269 --> 01:27:37,999
Stay tight. Here they come.

958
01:28:00,562 --> 01:28:02,962
- Fire up the pulse cannon!
- We're on it, sir.

959
01:28:06,401 --> 01:28:07,800
- I'll do it!
- Put it down!

960
01:28:07,903 --> 01:28:09,393
Your choice, Duke.

961
01:28:10,138 --> 01:28:11,730
Charging pulse cannon.

962
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,014
Everybody stay tight on the enemy craft.

963
01:28:26,121 --> 01:28:27,986
Don't let that cannon catch you
out in the open.

964
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:29,786
Bogey at 10 o'clock.

965
01:28:29,892 --> 01:28:31,621
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!

966
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:36,392
Missile 2, all telemetry
and propulsion systems nominal.

967
01:29:04,395 --> 01:29:06,625
- Ripcord, can you hear me?
- Loud and clear, buddy.

968
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:08,857
Doing Mach 6 and loving it!

969
01:29:09,733 --> 01:29:11,701
Come on, girl.
Time to show me what you got.

970
01:29:14,305 --> 01:29:17,206
Okay, Rip, I have the coordinates
of the other 2 warheads.

971
01:29:17,308 --> 01:29:19,970
The closest target is Moscow.
You'll have to hit that one first.

972
01:29:20,077 --> 01:29:21,567
Target 2 is Washington.

973
01:29:25,884 --> 01:29:27,283
You'll be safe down in this bunker, sir.

974
01:29:27,385 --> 01:29:30,114
- How soon before it strikes the city?
-17 minutes, sir.

975
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:32,620
- It's all up to the Joes now.
- Please hurry, Mr. President.

976
01:29:32,723 --> 01:29:34,419
We need to get you buttoned up.

977
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:55,377
General Hawk, we've lost our engines.
We're completely disabled.

978
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,575
Somebody take out that damn cannon.
There's 200 Joes on that sub.

979
01:29:58,684 --> 01:30:00,617
We're on it, sir. All right, Snake,

980
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:02,016
the cannon control room
should be right there,

981
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,020
where all the laser conduits converge.

982
01:30:05,023 --> 01:30:08,585
Did you think she loved you?
Did you imagine your life with her?

983
01:30:09,095 --> 01:30:10,960
All I know is,
neither one of you deserve her.

984
01:30:11,063 --> 01:30:13,554
- That's it. She dies!
- Don't do it, Rex!

985
01:30:26,579 --> 01:30:27,842
Come on.

986
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:31,378
I'm gonna get you out of here.

987
01:30:33,419 --> 01:30:34,545
Get up!

988
01:30:35,187 --> 01:30:36,848
You're coming with me.

989
01:30:53,106 --> 01:30:56,473
Ripcord, the Moscow missile
will impact in 4 minutes.

990
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:58,066
All right, I got a visual on it.

991
01:30:58,578 --> 01:30:59,704
Dead ahead.

992
01:31:00,648 --> 01:31:02,912
You have to knock it down
before it re-enters the atmosphere.

993
01:31:03,017 --> 01:31:04,711
If those nanomites hit the ground,
it's all over.

994
01:31:04,885 --> 01:31:06,182
They'll destroy the whole city.

995
01:31:06,286 --> 01:31:07,810
Houston, we have a problem.

996
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:11,221
- The fire controls are not in here.
- What do you mean, not in there?

997
01:31:11,559 --> 01:31:13,220
I mean, I don't see them anywhere.

998
01:31:14,095 --> 01:31:15,460
It must be voice-activated.

999
01:31:15,563 --> 01:31:16,791
Okay. Fire!

1000
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,894
Shoot! Blast away! Bust a cap!

1001
01:31:23,471 --> 01:31:26,565
- Nothing's happening!
- I bet it's in a different language.

1002
01:31:26,674 --> 01:31:29,837
Wait a minute. McCullen is Scottish.
Maybe the plane responds to Celtic.

1003
01:31:29,944 --> 01:31:33,005
- Try Teine.
- What?

1004
01:31:33,115 --> 01:31:36,982
- Teine. It's Celt, Scottish for fire.
- Okay, got it.

1005
01:31:45,928 --> 01:31:48,294
Nice going, ace.
You just saved Moscow.

1006
01:31:48,397 --> 01:31:51,160
Just doing my job.
Now guide me to Washington.

1007
01:31:57,539 --> 01:32:00,633
Yeah. Yeah, thanks, that's great news.
I'll let him know.

1008
01:32:00,742 --> 01:32:03,575
Sir, one of the Joes shot down
the warhead heading for Moscow.

1009
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:04,977
Thank God.

1010
01:32:09,651 --> 01:32:11,915
What are you doing? Oh, my God!

1011
01:32:17,126 --> 01:32:18,491
It's done.

1012
01:32:31,474 --> 01:32:35,205
Hello, Mr. President.
Mr. McCullen sends his regards.

1013
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:37,513
Oh, my God.

1014
01:32:39,449 --> 01:32:41,178
So, that's what this is all about.

1015
01:32:43,686 --> 01:32:45,654
All right. Keep tight, boys.

1016
01:32:45,755 --> 01:32:48,623
All guns on that cannon.
Torpedoes away!

1017
01:33:00,437 --> 01:33:01,563
I've just lost my wingman.

1018
01:33:01,672 --> 01:33:03,731
Retargeting Joe submarine.

1019
01:33:06,243 --> 01:33:07,801
I've got a shot.

1020
01:33:28,632 --> 01:33:31,898
Pulse cannon fault. Pulse cannon fault.

1021
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:34,596
Cannon now offline.

1022
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:48,249
- The whole damn system's down.
- I'm trying to bring it back online.

1023
01:33:55,261 --> 01:33:56,319
Now you die.

1024
01:34:19,285 --> 01:34:20,547
Launch immediately.

1025
01:34:20,653 --> 01:34:22,644
- Chart a course up to the ice pack.
- Yes, sir.

1026
01:34:38,205 --> 01:34:40,673
- We gotta go after Rex and McCullen.
- How could it be Rex?

1027
01:34:42,275 --> 01:34:44,140
Hey, Scarlett, it's Duke!

1028
01:34:44,244 --> 01:34:45,871
- He looks fine.
- But what's he doing with her?

1029
01:34:58,126 --> 01:35:01,253
Okay, we got a track on McCullen's sub.
He's headed up into the ice pack.

1030
01:35:04,364 --> 01:35:05,490
Duke, behind us!

1031
01:35:09,237 --> 01:35:11,398
Looks like they're onto us.
Ana, shoot those guys.

1032
01:35:11,506 --> 01:35:12,564
Love to.

1033
01:35:56,885 --> 01:36:00,583
When our master was killed,
you took a vow of silence.

1034
01:36:01,357 --> 01:36:03,655
Now you will die without a word.

1035
01:36:07,663 --> 01:36:09,995
All right, the second one in my sights.

1036
01:36:10,099 --> 01:36:13,297
Okay, Rip, you only got 30 seconds
before it enters the lower atmosphere.

1037
01:36:26,483 --> 01:36:27,575
I got you!

1038
01:36:35,792 --> 01:36:37,282
- Ripcord, you missed.
- The warhead has entered

1039
01:36:37,393 --> 01:36:38,393
the lower atmosphere.

1040
01:36:38,495 --> 01:36:40,463
I know, I know! I'm on it, I'm on it!

1041
01:36:44,368 --> 01:36:45,426
Shit!

1042
01:36:47,571 --> 01:36:49,835
- I can't shake these guys.
- Duke, I'm out!

1043
01:36:50,207 --> 01:36:52,800
- All right, let's see what we got here.
- Black Ray, Eliminator, LAW.

1044
01:36:52,909 --> 01:36:55,572
Laser Artillery Weapon.
That sounds good.

1045
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:03,146
- Scarlett!
- Hey, Duke!

1046
01:37:03,254 --> 01:37:04,312
I'm going after McCullen and Rex.

1047
01:37:04,422 --> 01:37:05,480
You guys better get the hell out of there.

1048
01:37:05,590 --> 01:37:07,614
I can't. Rip has one more warhead
to take down.

1049
01:37:07,725 --> 01:37:08,725
Rip, where is he?

1050
01:37:16,067 --> 01:37:18,865
The missile's just gone drone.
It's going in for the kill!

1051
01:38:20,934 --> 01:38:23,368
Sir, there's a hostile Mantis craft
coming up behind us.

1052
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:24,767
- Seal the door.
- Sir.

1053
01:38:31,211 --> 01:38:32,701
There you are.

1054
01:38:42,656 --> 01:38:44,521
One got through. I hit them!

1055
01:38:47,227 --> 01:38:49,024
Duke! They're back!

1056
01:38:52,934 --> 01:38:55,266
Going hot in 3, 2, 1.

1057
01:39:08,016 --> 01:39:10,678
There's gotta be another way around
to Rex and McCullen.

1058
01:39:10,785 --> 01:39:13,118
Charting new course for alternate route.

1059
01:39:21,195 --> 01:39:23,186
20 seconds until impact.

1060
01:39:23,298 --> 01:39:24,789
Come on, come on, come on.

1061
01:39:28,203 --> 01:39:29,829
You're too close, Rip! Back off!

1062
01:39:29,938 --> 01:39:33,965
Actually, I think
I'm just about close enough.

1063
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:53,525
He's taking the nanomites
back into the upper atmosphere.

1064
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:05,738
Ripcord, get out of that plane!

1065
01:40:05,841 --> 01:40:07,537
Almost there!

1066
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:11,909
Eject, Ripcord, eject!

1067
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:24,616
He did it. He actually did it.

1068
01:40:25,228 --> 01:40:26,388
Ripcord?

1069
01:40:28,933 --> 01:40:30,264
Ripcord?

1070
01:40:32,803 --> 01:40:33,860
Ripcord!

1071
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:35,961
Didn't I ask you not to yell at me?

1072
01:40:38,575 --> 01:40:42,774
Everybody, listen up! We still have
a lot of Joes out there in harm's way.

1073
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,006
Let's bring them home.

1074
01:40:47,418 --> 01:40:50,046
- Did it work?
- Yes, yes, it worked.

1075
01:40:51,389 --> 01:40:55,155
Good. Because I think
I'm about to get arrested, again.

1076
01:40:56,761 --> 01:40:57,761
Don't move!

1077
01:40:57,862 --> 01:40:59,420
- Hey, hey, same team, same team!
- Hands up!

1078
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:01,192
Same team.

1079
01:41:01,299 --> 01:41:02,926
Okay, okay, okay.

1080
01:41:08,539 --> 01:41:11,668
- What's our status?
- We've lost aft thrusters and the sonar.

1081
01:41:11,777 --> 01:41:15,406
- We're running blind.
- Kill them. Kill all the Joes.

1082
01:41:15,514 --> 01:41:18,381
- Detonate the ice pack.
- Right away, sir.

1083
01:41:26,691 --> 01:41:29,819
They're telling the other ships to abort.
He's gonna blow the ice pack.

1084
01:41:29,928 --> 01:41:32,523
This is Duke calling all Joes.
The ice pack's coming down!

1085
01:41:32,632 --> 01:41:33,792
There's a ton of steel and ice

1086
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:34,900
- headed your way!
- What?

1087
01:41:38,937 --> 01:41:41,633
Everybody, pull back! Pull back now!

1088
01:41:47,914 --> 01:41:50,007
Door! The door, the door! Get the door!

1089
01:41:53,385 --> 01:41:54,648
Come on!

1090
01:42:02,061 --> 01:42:05,498
Ana, we could get out of here right now,
free and clear, safe and sound.

1091
01:42:08,901 --> 01:42:11,495
- Let's get them.
- That's my girl.

1092
01:42:24,617 --> 01:42:27,451
- This is cutting it close, Duke.
- I'm not letting those 2 get away.

1093
01:42:30,624 --> 01:42:32,285
Come on, guys, get out of there!

1094
01:42:40,234 --> 01:42:41,531
Snake!

1095
01:43:21,677 --> 01:43:24,544
- This is Scarlett. We're all clear.
- This is Duke. We're clear, too.

1096
01:43:24,647 --> 01:43:26,274
Yo, Joe!

1097
01:43:32,321 --> 01:43:33,686
Yeah!

1098
01:43:51,106 --> 01:43:53,701
Now that we have
a moment to ourselves,

1099
01:43:54,678 --> 01:43:56,111
I've designed something

1100
01:43:56,213 --> 01:43:59,181
- especially for you, James.
- No!

1101
01:44:00,749 --> 01:44:02,684
This will only hurt a little.

1102
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:07,957
What comes next, more so.

1103
01:44:13,029 --> 01:44:16,362
Nanomites, perfect little healers.

1104
01:44:29,981 --> 01:44:33,677
I've finally taken my place
in a long line of McCullens.

1105
01:44:33,783 --> 01:44:39,984
James McCullen is no more.
Now you are Destro.

1106
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:44,421
What have you done to me?

1107
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:57,566
The time has come for the cobra
to rise up and reveal himself.

1108
01:45:00,379 --> 01:45:04,678
You will call me Commander.

1109
01:45:16,295 --> 01:45:19,093
This is Captain Duke Hauser.
Prepare to be boarded.

1110
01:45:21,066 --> 01:45:22,158
Sir.

1111
01:45:24,936 --> 01:45:28,566
You are relentless, Duke.
I'll give you that much.

1112
01:45:29,676 --> 01:45:33,442
And what's to stop me
from blowing you out of the water?

1113
01:45:33,546 --> 01:45:36,912
Self-preservation. I'm taking you in, Rex.

1114
01:45:40,753 --> 01:45:42,584
You and what army?

1115
01:45:43,990 --> 01:45:45,252
My army.

1116
01:46:01,308 --> 01:46:04,766
You know, Duke,
this has only just begun.

1117
01:46:10,583 --> 01:46:12,211
I'll be waiting for you.

1118
01:46:24,665 --> 01:46:27,498
I've never seen encoding like this.
I mean, physically, she's fine,

1119
01:46:27,601 --> 01:46:30,229
but when Rex programmed them,
he sure didn't want them taken out.

1120
01:46:30,337 --> 01:46:32,670
- So there's nothing you can do for her?
- It'll take some time,

1121
01:46:32,774 --> 01:46:34,674
but we'll take them out.

1122
01:46:39,646 --> 01:46:41,238
Till we get those things
out of your head,

1123
01:46:41,348 --> 01:46:43,408
looks like you're gonna be
seeing a lot of me around here.

1124
01:46:43,518 --> 01:46:47,579
You can't save me, Duke.
No one can, not after all I've done.

1125
01:46:48,156 --> 01:46:50,021
Look, that wasn't you.

1126
01:46:52,894 --> 01:46:54,725
I'm not giving up on you.

1127
01:47:28,998 --> 01:47:31,592
- Man, we look good.
- Yeah, well, you better get used to it.

1128
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:34,464
Heavy Duty thinks you guys
ought to stick around permanently.

1129
01:47:34,570 --> 01:47:35,764
So, you're asking us, right?

1130
01:47:35,871 --> 01:47:36,964
Yeah, 'cause he didn't sound
like he was asking.

1131
01:47:37,073 --> 01:47:38,199
'Cause you gotta be asked
to join the G.I. Joes.

1132
01:47:38,308 --> 01:47:39,605
I'm asking.

1133
01:47:40,143 --> 01:47:41,200
Well, I'm in.

1134
01:47:41,310 --> 01:47:45,576
- How do you feel about this?
- I feel very emotional.

1135
01:47:46,482 --> 01:47:49,941
All Joes mobilize and ready check
for Operation Mongoose.

1136
01:47:50,053 --> 01:47:53,318
All ground transports,
rendezvous at Base Brothers Grimm.

1137
01:47:53,423 --> 01:47:56,323
All Howler Hunters will rendezvous
at Base Roman Ruin.

1138
01:47:56,425 --> 01:47:57,983
Good luck, Joes.

1139
01:47:59,592 --> 01:48:05,392
Subtitles: Arigon

1140
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:32,020
Mr. President, it's good to see you.

1141
01:48:32,129 --> 01:48:33,994
- Thank you. And you.
- It's nice to have you back safely, sir.

1142
01:48:34,098 --> 01:48:35,690
- Thank you. John.
- Welcome back, sir.

1143
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:38,735
Thank you. Thank you all so much.

1144
