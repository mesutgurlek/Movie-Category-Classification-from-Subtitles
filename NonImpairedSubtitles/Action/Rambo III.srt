1
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,674
John!

2
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,778
John Rambo!

3
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:30,879
I don't believe this!

4
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:40,890
- So where you're coming from?
- Washington.

5
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:44,119
- Good to see you again!
- Yeah, you too.

6
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,084
Do you want to tell me about it?

7
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:50,358
About what?

8
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:54,505
About yesterday, I've seen you stick
fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok.

9
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,211
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

10
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:00,697
And today I find you,
working in a monastery.

11
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:04,664
They let me live here and
I help out, fixing things.

12
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,247
And the stick fighting?

13
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:08,727
I just do that for their lack of money.

14
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,774
Yeah...I saw you give it to the monks.

15
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:15,477
You see a lot.

16
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,325
Colonel, who are they?

17
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:22,241
They're part of the reason I'm here.

18
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,103
This is Robert Griggs, he's a
field officer of our local embassy.

19
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:29,574
John Rambo.

20
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,872
Pleasure.

21
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,173
Well, you're sure not easy to find!

22
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:35,883
Why are you keepin' track?

23
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:40,046
Well, like the Colonel says,
good men are hard to find!

24
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:46,530
John, I'd like you to take a
look at some of these photos.

25
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:49,472
I don't know how much you
know about Afghanistan.

26
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:52,611
Most people can't even find it on a map!

27
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:55,274
But over two million civilians,

28
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:57,874
mostly peasants
farmers and their families,

29
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:01,733
have been systematically
slaughtered by invading Russian armies.

30
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,408
Every new weapon,

31
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,536
including chemical warfare, has
been used to eliminate these people.

32
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:13,565
And they've been very
successful, at many levels.

33
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:18,673
I assume that you're out of touch
with the current states of the war.

34
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,135
But after nine years of fighting,

35
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:24,118
the Afghan Forces are now
getting their Stinger missiles,

36
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:26,639
and are now beginning to hold
their own against the Air-Strikes.

37
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:30,686
Except for one region,
50 miles over the border.

38
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,915
Apparently, the Soviet Commander
there is exceptionally brutal,

39
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,729
as those photos indicate.

40
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:40,381
And he's managed to string
allow all aid from the outside.

41
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,819
So we want to...

42
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:47,868
investigate the problem firsthand.

43
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:49,972
And what that's got to do with me?

44
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,627
They've asked me to go in.

45
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:55,712
You're not gonna do it?

46
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:59,465
Yes. And I want you to
come with me, John.

47
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,487
I put in my time.

48
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,132
What does that mean?

49
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:06,261
It means my war is over.

50
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,384
I thought you said he
was this great soldier.

51
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:22,742
Well, Colonel...

52
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:25,948
that's like we've got a
long walk down those stairs.

53
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:45,762
Don't be tough on him,
he's just following orders.

54
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:49,097
This mission's important, John.

55
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:51,371
Do you really think we
can make a difference?

56
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,078
If I didn't, I wouldn't be going.

57
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:56,187
- It didn't before.
- That was another time.

58
00:11:57,694 --> 00:11:59,320
Come with me, John.

59
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:08,157
I don't know what you think
about this place, but I like it.

60
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:13,287
I like bein' here, I like workin'
here. I like belong into something.

61
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:16,005
You DO belong into something. Not this.

62
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:19,105
When you're gonna come full circle?

63
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:20,976
What are you talkin' about?

64
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:25,469
You said that your war is over.
I think the one out there is,

65
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:27,971
but not the one inside you.

66
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:31,636
I know the reasons you're here, John.
But it doesn't work that way.

67
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:36,140
You may try, but you can't get
away from what you really are.

68
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,477
And what is it I am?

69
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:39,077
A full-blooded combat soldier.

70
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,526
Not any more. I dont want it.

71
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,815
That's too bad, 'cause
you're stuck with it.

72
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:45,950
Let me tell you a story, John.

73
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,455
There was a sculptor and he
found a stone, a special stone.

74
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:52,914
He dragged it home and he
worked on it for months,

75
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:54,600
until he finally finished.

76
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:57,420
When he was ready, he
showed it to his friends,

77
00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:59,506
and they said he had
created a great statue.

78
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:01,921
The sculptor said he
hadn't created anything.

79
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:04,253
The statue was always there.

80
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:07,318
He just cleared away to small pieces.

81
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:10,976
We didn't make you
this fighting machine.

82
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:14,760
We just shifted away the rough edges.

83
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:17,447
Your own is gonna be
tearing away with yourself,

84
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:19,663
until you come to terms
with what you are!

85
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,273
Until you come full circle.

86
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:27,238
I guess I'm not ready yet.

87
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:34,659
Well, I got to move.

88
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:40,501
Promise me you'll look me
when you're next in the States.

89
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:42,539
I promise.

90
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:44,469
Colonel!

91
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,797
I'm sorry. But it's gotta
end for me sometime.

92
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:52,834
I understand.

93
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,389
Take cover!

94
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:46,606
Drop your weapons and
remain where you are!

95
00:15:47,969 --> 00:15:49,760
You cannot escape!

96
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:57,011
Drop your weapons!

97
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,103
You have no chance of escape!

98
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:03,017
Drop your weapons!

99
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:04,522
Now!

100
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,528
Rambo!

101
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,025
Something went wrong.

102
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,263
What happened?

103
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:39,118
Soviets intercepted the
team, just over the border.

104
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:43,649
Among we've gathered,
Trautman and the rest of his party

105
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,984
have been taken to the
regional commandment post.

106
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:48,225
And what are you doing about it?

107
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:51,282
I can't do anything about it.

108
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:53,056
I'm sorry.

109
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:55,795
I just thought you should know.

110
00:16:57,664 --> 00:16:58,966
What about me?

111
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,663
About you?

112
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:04,325
Can you get me in?

113
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:06,022
You're not serious.

114
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:07,667
Oh yeah, I'm serious.

115
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:11,677
It can't be done officially.

116
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:13,282
Make it unofficial.

117
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:18,017
If it can be done, I want you to
know upfront of your capture,

118
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:19,972
or any of this leaks,

119
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:24,389
we'll deny any participation, or
even knowledge of your existence.

120
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:27,312
I'm used to it.

121
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:30,279
We'll get back.

122
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,635
You want to buy? Many guns here!

123
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:01,701
No. I'm looking for Mousa Chanin.

124
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,791
- What's your name?
- John Rambo.

125
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:09,952
Wait here.

126
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:34,061
They sell many in Afghanistan.

127
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,282
Many landmines.

128
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:40,202
Landmines everywhere.

129
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:44,621
I am Mousa Chanin.
What is it you want?

130
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,079
I was sent by Griggs.

131
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:50,208
You do not look like
men Griggs sent before.

132
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,705
You not look like you are with military.

133
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:54,777
I'm not.

134
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,672
What you are? A mercenary?

135
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,866
No.

136
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:01,628
You're not a military, you're
not a mercenary, what are you?

137
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,492
Lost tourist?

138
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,481
I'm not a tourist.

139
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,317
Sorry.

140
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,046
Do you know where the American is?

141
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:18,778
Yes. In a Soviet fort.

142
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,778
Near the village of Khost,
30 miles over the border.

143
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:26,021
Mr. Griggs sent you the
supplies you asked for.

144
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,750
You wish to see them now?

145
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,106
Yeah.

146
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,313
Is this what you asked for?

147
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:35,039
Yeah.

148
00:20:35,593 --> 00:20:38,084
Never seen these things
before. What are these?

149
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:41,092
- Detonators.
- And this?

150
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:43,464
What is this for?

151
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,246
It's blue light.

152
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:47,682
What does it do?

153
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:50,313
It turns blue.

154
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,355
I see.

155
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:55,131
Can you tell me how many
more men come with us?

156
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,271
There's no rescue team. There's just me.

157
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,906
Just you? Come on, this is no good!

158
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,992
I can not take only one man to the fort.

159
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:03,974
You need more men to help.

160
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:07,201
Griggs said you'd take
me there. Take me there!

161
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,808
I am meant to take medical supplies,

162
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,096
if I not take it, many people will die.

163
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:13,630
Do you understand?

164
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:17,174
Well, I do not know who you really are,

165
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:20,823
but by the way you look, I can see
you have no experience in war. Do you?

166
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,462
Come on, do you?

167
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:26,655
I've fired a few shots.

168
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,785
A few shots?

169
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:35,483
Come on, maybe you should go back home,

170
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:37,148
and think it all over again.

171
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:38,714
For a very long time.

172
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,946
I did think it over.

173
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:48,120
You did?

174
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,325
Well, this is your choice.

175
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:55,211
But let me tell you, you can
not get this American alone.

176
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,969
If you fail, do not blame me.

177
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:01,178
I will accept no responsibility.

178
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:05,283
Sounds familiar.

179
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:44,095
My name is Colonel Zaysen,
Regional Commander of this sector.

180
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:52,271
You're here as the first
American captured in Afghanistan.

181
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:54,766
Congratulations.

182
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:59,269
I believe you're planning to
supply enemy rebels forces

183
00:22:59,322 --> 00:23:03,258
with Stinger missiles, intending
to destroy Soviet aircraft.

184
00:23:03,952 --> 00:23:05,244
If I'm gonna be interrogated,

185
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:07,996
I wanna be interrogated
by your superiors.

186
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:12,916
Out here, I have no superiors.

187
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:16,243
I am in full command.

188
00:23:18,424 --> 00:23:20,315
You're alone here.

189
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,840
Abandoned by your government.

190
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:32,140
- What do you want?
- Cooperation.

191
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:39,296
This sector has been under
total control for over five years.

192
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:43,777
There's little more I can do here.

193
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:48,671
It is, as you say, without challenges.

194
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,231
If you supply to me
worth information about most

195
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,669
stinger missiles
you're planning to deliver,

196
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:59,694
it could provide a way
out of this further post.

197
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:04,627
After all, the end what
everyone really wants...

198
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,844
...is peace.

199
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:10,301
The Kremlin's got a hell
of a sense of humor.

200
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:13,099
Please explain.

201
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:16,167
You talk peace and
disarmament to the world,

202
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:18,731
and here you are, wiping
out a race of people.

203
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:22,195
We are wiping out no one.

204
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:27,234
I think you're too intelligent
to believe such a propaganda!

205
00:24:28,411 --> 00:24:30,571
Now again: where are the missiles?

206
00:24:30,622 --> 00:24:32,140
I don't know anything
about any missiles!

207
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:33,658
Of course you do!

208
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:37,399
But you do not seem to realize
I'm providing a way out for us both.

209
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:39,376
You expect sympathy?

210
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,464
You started this damn war,
now you have to deal with it!

211
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:47,117
And we will. It is just a matter of time
before we achieve a complete victory.

212
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:48,545
You know there won't be a victory.

213
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:52,388
Everyday, your war machines lose
ground to a bunch of poorly armed,

214
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:54,471
poorly equiped freedom-fighters!

215
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:57,435
The fact is that you
underestimated your competition.

216
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,322
If you studied your History,

217
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:01,042
you'd know this people
never gave up to anyone.

218
00:25:01,194 --> 00:25:05,152
They'd rather die than be
slaves to an invading army.

219
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:07,156
You can't defeat a people like that.

220
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:10,849
We tried. We already had our Vietnam!

221
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:13,952
Now you're gonna have yours!

222
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:17,788
So, you wish to test me. Good.

223
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:58,622
This is Afghanistan.

224
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:02,377
Alexander the Great tried
to conquer this country,

225
00:26:02,673 --> 00:26:06,727
then Ghenghis Khan, then
the British, now Russia.

226
00:26:07,824 --> 00:26:10,555
But Afghan people fight
hard, they never be defeated.

227
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,328
Ancient enemy make prayer about
these people. Do you wish to hear?

228
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:19,356
Very good. It says:

229
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:22,058
"May God deliver us from
the venom of the cobra,

230
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:25,859
teeth of the tiger, and the
vengeance of the Afghans."

231
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:29,276
Understand what this means?

232
00:26:31,077 --> 00:26:34,079
That you guys don't take any shit.

233
00:26:34,831 --> 00:26:37,286
Yes, something like this.

234
00:26:42,295 --> 00:26:43,245
We go now!

235
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,162
In the north, there are many
caves, we'll travel through them.

236
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,002
It'll be safer. We go!

237
00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:30,965
This cave leads to the
"Valley of the Five Lions".

238
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:36,306
The Afghan King was asked to send
500 of his warriors into battle.

239
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:38,392
He sent only five.

240
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:44,060
His greatest five, and they won.

241
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:47,610
He said, it's better to send
five lions than 500 sheep.

242
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:51,240
- What do you think of this?
- I think the King was lucky.

243
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:57,110
- How much longer till the village?
- About two hours.

244
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,550
Where in my sector are the
missiles being delivered?

245
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,845
I don't know.

246
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:19,263
You liar.

247
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,435
Where?

248
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:28,397
Where?

249
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:30,779
OK, I'll tell ya.

250
00:28:32,742 --> 00:28:35,411
I knew you were lying.

251
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,594
Now, where are the missiles located?

252
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:42,740
Close.

253
00:28:43,462 --> 00:28:44,576
How close?

254
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:48,078
In your ass!

255
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,104
You've tried my patience long enough.

256
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:14,216
I tried to be civilian.

257
00:29:46,378 --> 00:29:47,956
The name John Rambo...

258
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:54,885
...do you know it?

259
00:29:56,638 --> 00:29:57,634
No?

260
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:01,328
He says that there's a
plan for a rescue attempt

261
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:03,726
with the help of some of the rebels.

262
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,186
He also says he knows
where this man is going.

263
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:13,440
We will welcome him.

264
00:30:32,383 --> 00:30:35,966
It's the last village in the
valley. About 200 man here.

265
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:39,953
There's a lot of lot of kids in.

266
00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:42,476
Yes, and they are good fighters, too.

267
00:30:42,936 --> 00:30:45,034
I'll tell the leaders you want to talk.

268
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:53,689
They've never seen men look like you.

269
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:02,517
Here are Mujahedin horsemen.

270
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:05,789
There are 10.000 horsemen
more waiting at the border.

271
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,790
They are waiting to get
weapons, when they'll get it,

272
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:09,728
they'll come back here to fight.

273
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:30,560
Let's go to the hospital.

274
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:38,157
He is the only doctor for 500 km.

275
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,362
The first medicine they
get in two months.

276
00:31:53,673 --> 00:31:57,457
More gifts from the Soviets. They
look like toys, but they're mines.

277
00:31:57,927 --> 00:32:00,179
We teach the childrens not to
touch, some of them too late.

278
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:06,310
Who's that?

279
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,846
His name is Juri. He's Russian.

280
00:32:09,314 --> 00:32:10,522
A deserter?

281
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:12,981
He calls himself a defector.
There are many like him.

282
00:32:13,444 --> 00:32:17,508
He is the one who can help the most,
he knows the inside of the fort.

283
00:32:21,493 --> 00:32:23,115
I think we should go now.

284
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:48,809
Mines start here: one meter like
this, then two meters like this,

285
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:50,468
and like this.

286
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:53,561
There are four towers, four guards,

287
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:57,146
here, here, here and here.

288
00:32:57,739 --> 00:32:58,926
Where do they keep the prisoners?

289
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,530
Here.

290
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:04,612
If we get in there,
is there another way out?

291
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:07,875
Underground, where
there's all dirty water.

292
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:10,747
But I do not know word for this place.

293
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:13,535
He means sewer. Where is it?

294
00:33:14,004 --> 00:33:18,298
Here. Outside, you go there.
Guards patrolls there.

295
00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:20,962
I do not think you go this way.

296
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,802
I wish we go to the minefields.
They'll never expect it.

297
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:28,448
This can not be done.
There are many Spetnaz commandos.

298
00:33:29,228 --> 00:33:31,958
We have all of this,
we've lost many men.

299
00:33:32,941 --> 00:33:34,046
We'll lose more men if we go there.

300
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:36,818
I don't need many men.

301
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,529
What is it you want to do?

302
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:42,115
I need two men to lead
me to the minefield,

303
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:43,740
and two to help to escape.

304
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:47,369
If this is done, Soviets
will come here like before,

305
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:48,892
and more people will die.

306
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:51,205
I can't wait.

307
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:54,331
You must wait for help the way we wait.

308
00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:59,210
- Then I'll go alone.
- And you will die!

309
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,880
Then I'll die.

310
00:34:09,268 --> 00:34:10,431
Wait!

311
00:34:11,939 --> 00:34:13,267
Please don't go.

312
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:22,864
My name is Masoud.

313
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,492
You must not judge us,

314
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:28,390
before you understand why
we are not directed to help.

315
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,158
Most of the Afghan
people are very strong,

316
00:34:33,627 --> 00:34:36,581
and we are determined not
to be driven from our land.

317
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,235
Our children die of disease,
mines, and poison gas.

318
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,841
And our women are raped and killed.

319
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:50,844
Last year, in the valley of
Legman, the next valley,

320
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:52,749
6.000 Afghans were killed.

321
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:57,395
Pregnant women were cut with bayonets,

322
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:01,191
and their babies thrown into the fire.

323
00:35:01,988 --> 00:35:06,319
This is done, so they will not have to
fight the next generation of Afghans.

324
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:10,237
Yet nobody sees anything, or
reads anything in the papers.

325
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,285
What you see here,

326
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:16,832
are the Mujahedin soldiers,

327
00:35:17,337 --> 00:35:18,713
holy warriors.

328
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:22,009
To us, this war is a holy war.

329
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:24,965
And there is no true
death for a Mujahedin,

330
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:27,462
because we have taken our last nights,

331
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:30,803
and because we consider us already dead.

332
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:35,304
To us, death for our
land and God is an honor.

333
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:37,138
So, my friend,

334
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:43,147
what we must do is to stop this
killing of our women and children.

335
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:47,024
If getting this man free,

336
00:35:47,716 --> 00:35:53,763
so he can tells to the free world, and
tell what happens here, is necessary

337
00:35:53,812 --> 00:35:55,581
then of course we will help.

338
00:35:57,921 --> 00:36:02,547
Leave us now, so we may
speak among ourselves

339
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:05,546
and find the best way to free this man.

340
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:13,979
- Thank you.
- We thank you.

341
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,124
Don't worry, they will decide soon.

342
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:43,943
- We got to leave tonight.
- What is your name?

343
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:49,963
This boy is very hard inside.

344
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:52,011
His parents were killed last year.

345
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,188
His brother died in the
fort where the American is.

346
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,600
He looks like a boy, but
he fights like a man.

347
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:02,391
- What's your name?
- Rambo.

348
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:05,696
- Where are you from?
- Arizona.

349
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,967
Arizona? How much days walk?

350
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:10,403
About two years.

351
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,115
Two years...

352
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:16,279
- Are you a soldier?
- No more.

353
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:20,628
I am a soldier. Are you here to fight?

354
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:23,248
- No.
- Are you scared?

355
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:28,715
What is this?

356
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,200
It's a knife.

357
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:31,847
- Can I see this?
- Sure.

358
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:41,148
Very good. Can I have it?

359
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:42,603
No.

360
00:37:44,778 --> 00:37:46,771
- What is this?
- You want everything!

361
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,861
- This is for luck.
- What is luck?

362
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:51,819
Luck is...

363
00:37:54,037 --> 00:37:55,846
Can I have it? I need luck.

364
00:37:55,847 --> 00:37:57,657
So do I!

365
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,545
What a child! Always like this.

366
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:10,345
Look there! It's our national sport.

367
00:38:10,804 --> 00:38:13,360
An old, insane game,
maybe 3.000 years old!

368
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,886
Look, they never stop playing.

369
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:22,040
War or not war, they don't mind.

370
00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:25,778
- You like it?
- I'll take football.

371
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,403
What is football? You
play it with the foot?

372
00:38:29,865 --> 00:38:31,027
Not really.

373
00:38:41,962 --> 00:38:43,336
Come on, let's go!

374
00:38:55,184 --> 00:38:58,137
- What are they saying?
- They want you to try.

375
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:02,470
It's a way to them for you to be with
them. If you want to try, go ahead but

376
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,312
I'm not responsible for it!

377
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:11,482
- I'll try it.
- Yes?

378
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,593
What are the rules?

379
00:39:14,698 --> 00:39:17,300
Well, you have to take
the sheep once around,

380
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:20,243
and then thrown it in the circle.

381
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:21,891
Why?

382
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:23,158
Because there is a circle there.

383
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:27,710
- That's it?
- That's it! Very simple.

384
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:31,506
Like football.

385
00:39:31,507 --> 00:39:33,796
God must love crazy people!

386
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,993
- Why?
- He makes so many of them!

387
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:17,639
Now you see how it is here.

388
00:47:19,025 --> 00:47:21,978
Somewhere in a war,
there's supposed to be honor.

389
00:47:22,445 --> 00:47:24,901
Where is the honor here? Where?

390
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:30,738
We're taking the survivors to
the border. Are you coming?

391
00:47:32,372 --> 00:47:33,652
I'm going to the fort.

392
00:47:34,123 --> 00:47:36,448
Have you not seen enough death?

393
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:41,790
Go away while you can.
This is not your war.

394
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:46,593
It is now.

395
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:53,267
So be it.

396
00:47:53,727 --> 00:47:55,055
You are a good friend.

397
00:48:05,657 --> 00:48:08,147
I stay. I will show you the way.

398
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:09,945
I will go too.

399
00:48:11,077 --> 00:48:12,108
No, you go with them.

400
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:17,076
I will not. They killed all
my family. I want to fight!

401
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:20,784
Not with me. You go!

402
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:23,293
Go on.

403
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,091
Why must you do this?

404
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,015
Cause he'd do it for me.

405
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:01,792
Are you decided to talk?

406
00:49:02,879 --> 00:49:03,875
No?

407
00:49:05,257 --> 00:49:06,205
Very well.

408
00:49:07,467 --> 00:49:11,513
Soon you will be my
guest down the hall...

409
00:50:43,399 --> 00:50:44,679
- Go back!
- No!

410
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:46,182
Go back!

411
00:51:15,097 --> 00:51:16,378
Go on!

412
00:51:18,392 --> 00:51:19,660
Stay here! Stay back.

413
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:21,346
I know this place. You need me!

414
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,517
I don't need you dead!
Now go back. You understand?

415
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:28,815
American?

416
00:58:30,412 --> 00:58:31,657
American?

417
00:58:54,103 --> 00:58:55,811
Colonel? Colonel?

418
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:04,229
John? How the hell did you get in here?

419
00:59:04,698 --> 00:59:07,532
- Can you move?
- I can.

420
00:59:09,576 --> 00:59:10,775
Let's go!

421
00:59:15,748 --> 00:59:16,726
John, behind you!

422
00:59:27,553 --> 00:59:29,095
Go!

423
00:59:34,686 --> 00:59:36,891
John, get out of here!
Get the hell outta here!

424
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:35,826
Over here!

425
01:01:36,286 --> 01:01:37,200
Come on!

426
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:45,505
Help me!

427
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:21,958
Take him!

428
01:02:43,521 --> 01:02:44,518
Come on!

429
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:49,855
Give me the boy!

430
01:03:09,672 --> 01:03:11,166
Come!

431
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:24,177
Come on!

432
01:03:26,315 --> 01:03:27,479
Take the kid!

433
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,019
Jump down!

434
01:04:45,521 --> 01:04:48,095
Give me the boy!

435
01:05:42,327 --> 01:05:46,372
Who is this terrorist? What
makes you so valuable to him?

436
01:05:46,831 --> 01:05:50,491
This bastard tried to destroy
me tonight. But he failed!

437
01:05:50,752 --> 01:05:55,000
At sunrise, I will track him down, and
have his skin hanging on the wall!

438
01:05:55,466 --> 01:05:58,669
- You don't have to hunt him.
- What?

439
01:05:59,137 --> 01:06:00,714
He'll find you.

440
01:06:03,932 --> 01:06:06,175
Are you insane?

441
01:06:06,645 --> 01:06:09,729
One man against trained commandos?

442
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:13,854
Who do you think this man is? God?

443
01:06:15,778 --> 01:06:19,028
No. God would have mercy. He won't!

444
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:35,401
It's all right. There's nobody there.

445
01:06:35,507 --> 01:06:36,402
Good.

446
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:37,609
This will hold a while.

447
01:06:39,173 --> 01:06:40,650
What's the fastest way outta here?

448
01:06:41,324 --> 01:06:43,971
Northwest, there's a
trail between mountains,

449
01:06:44,224 --> 01:06:48,056
about three kilometers from
here. The trail is very difficult.

450
01:06:50,063 --> 01:06:52,932
- You take the boy and go.
- I want to stay.

451
01:06:53,482 --> 01:06:54,870
You can't.

452
01:06:56,736 --> 01:06:59,904
You can not go back there.
We must all go to Pakistan.

453
01:07:00,574 --> 01:07:02,258
No, I gotta go back.

454
01:07:02,781 --> 01:07:04,986
I know he's your friend,
but you can't do this!

455
01:07:05,453 --> 01:07:08,033
You both will die.
For what? Come with us!

456
01:07:08,138 --> 01:07:09,153
Just do what I say.

457
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:14,247
Give me your gun.

458
01:07:19,509 --> 01:07:22,379
All right, let's go. Come on!

459
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:41,606
I will see you again?

460
01:07:42,366 --> 01:07:43,362
Sure.

461
01:13:40,644 --> 01:13:42,019
Come on!

462
01:13:53,324 --> 01:13:54,449
Can you fly that thing?

463
01:13:55,075 --> 01:13:55,990
Let's find out.

464
01:14:20,726 --> 01:14:22,386
Let's go!

465
01:14:49,422 --> 01:14:50,702
Hold on!

466
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:02,469
Over there!

467
01:15:08,316 --> 01:15:09,265
There!

468
01:15:28,669 --> 01:15:30,163
Hold on!

469
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:31,959
Get him up!

470
01:15:32,425 --> 01:15:34,381
Take my hand!

471
01:15:58,909 --> 01:15:59,857
We're going down!

472
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:16,333
Hold on!

473
01:16:32,944 --> 01:16:34,567
Take what you can!

474
01:16:35,028 --> 01:16:37,520
- Come on, move it, move it!
- Go on!

475
01:16:50,127 --> 01:16:52,285
- We gotta hit the border.
- We stay here.

476
01:16:52,755 --> 01:16:54,213
We know where to go.

477
01:16:54,673 --> 01:16:57,674
- Which direction, John?
- Northeast!

478
01:17:45,767 --> 01:17:47,261
Hold it, John!

479
01:17:50,605 --> 01:17:52,227
I gotta rest a minute.

480
01:17:54,442 --> 01:17:55,441
How's your wound?

481
01:17:56,484 --> 01:17:58,523
You taught us to ignore
the pain, didn't ya?

482
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,215
Has it worked?

483
01:18:01,674 --> 01:18:02,691
Not really!

484
01:18:04,243 --> 01:18:05,862
Don't take it personally!

485
01:18:07,538 --> 01:18:08,533
Thanks.

486
01:18:29,228 --> 01:18:31,897
You go on ahead and see if
you can find some cover.

487
01:19:44,137 --> 01:19:46,546
That was close, John! How are you?

488
01:19:47,431 --> 01:19:48,803
Well done!

489
01:20:00,278 --> 01:20:03,362
We won't make it easy for them.
We'd better split out!

490
01:20:04,657 --> 01:20:06,815
I'm sorry I got you into this, John!

491
01:20:07,284 --> 01:20:08,862
No, you're not!

492
01:21:09,472 --> 01:21:12,842
- Are you listening?
- Who are you?

493
01:21:14,228 --> 01:21:16,434
Your worst nightmare.

494
01:23:10,512 --> 01:23:11,509
It's good timing!

495
01:23:12,031 --> 01:23:13,027
What are friends for?

496
01:23:15,331 --> 01:23:17,834
You go back to the hole. I'll cover
you, and see if there's any more left.

497
01:26:35,386 --> 01:26:37,361
Across the valley is the border.

498
01:26:39,598 --> 01:26:40,922
We did it, John!

499
01:26:43,393 --> 01:26:44,674
Wait!

500
01:26:48,608 --> 01:26:50,647
What the hell is that?

501
01:26:54,028 --> 01:26:55,488
The son of a bitch!

502
01:27:21,431 --> 01:27:23,840
Do not try to retreat!

503
01:27:24,392 --> 01:27:25,769
You can not escape.

504
01:27:26,228 --> 01:27:28,553
We will not attack if you do not run!

505
01:27:29,231 --> 01:27:30,498
We do not want to hurt you.

506
01:27:31,542 --> 01:27:32,600
Somehow I don't believe him!

507
01:27:33,069 --> 01:27:37,066
I order you to come forward,
and you will be given a fair trial.

508
01:27:37,531 --> 01:27:40,088
Drop your weapons,
and remain where you are.

509
01:27:40,243 --> 01:27:42,034
You got any ideas?

510
01:27:43,412 --> 01:27:45,784
Drop your weapons!

511
01:27:46,456 --> 01:27:48,177
Surrounding them, Sir.

512
01:27:49,835 --> 01:27:52,458
Helluva time for humor, John!

513
01:27:52,922 --> 01:27:55,330
Drop your weapons! Now!

514
01:27:56,843 --> 01:27:58,503
You have no chance of escape.

515
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:02,753
Come forward! I want
to pick you back alive.

516
01:28:03,223 --> 01:28:05,431
This is your last warning!

517
01:28:08,689 --> 01:28:09,934
The choice is yours.

518
01:28:10,398 --> 01:28:12,057
What do you say, John?

519
01:28:14,276 --> 01:28:16,320
Fuck 'em!

520
01:28:34,549 --> 01:28:37,038
If we're gonna go, I would
crave to take that bastard with us!

521
01:29:15,172 --> 01:29:16,287
What is that?

522
01:29:26,309 --> 01:29:28,016
It's the rebels!

523
01:29:40,656 --> 01:29:41,438
Come on!

524
01:33:26,468 --> 01:33:27,381
John, get out of there!

525
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,940
You're sure you don't want to stay?
You fight good for a tourist!

526
01:35:09,906 --> 01:35:11,339
Maybe next time.

527
01:35:12,742 --> 01:35:14,366
Do you want this back?

528
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:17,984
No. You keep it.

529
01:35:18,705 --> 01:35:20,366
Can you not stay?

530
01:35:34,181 --> 01:35:35,509
I gotta go.

531
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:01,701
Goodbye.

532
01:36:09,882 --> 01:36:10,943
Hard to believe, John!

533
01:36:11,777 --> 01:36:12,733
What's that, Sir?

534
01:36:13,094 --> 01:36:17,341
Well, I hate to admit it, but the
truth is I think we're getting soft!

535
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:20,469
Maybe just a little, Sir...

536
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,659
Just a little!

537
