1
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,274
l can't support
this activity any longer, Max.

2
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,598
Relax, Jack. Only two more days and we
move our whole disposal operation north -

3
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,472
out of your jurisdiction.

4
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,559
You promised me those barrels'd
be leakproof for 1 50 years.

5
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,958
A slight miscalculation.
Look, it's this simple.

6
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,199
l have an obligation
to produce paint thinner.

7
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,474
You have an obligation to provide
a place to dispose of the waste products.

8
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,990
l'm not afraid of you any more, Potterdam.

9
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,591
lf l have to expose the whole operation,
l will. l'll bring us all down.

10
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,269
l think you're smarter than that, Jack.

11
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,755
You can't pay me enough, Max.

12
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,551
Kiss your chances of getting elected
mayor goodbye, Mr City Councilman.

13
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,319
lt's bigger than an election, Max.

14
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,915
Boss?

15
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,318
There's a time and a place
for everything, gentlemen.

16
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,515
You have an obligation to provide
a place to dispose of the waste products.

17
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,959
l got you.

18
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,474
(radio) Good morning. You're listening to
the Poor man on the world-famous KROQ.

19
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,194
And you still have time
to call in on open-line,

20
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,676
where at 5am, let's face it,
we can talk about absolutely anything.

21
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,270
lt's live, it's uncensored,
and l'm not even using the tape delay

22
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,391
because this is primetime radio,

23
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,718
the 2 to 6am show
where management sleeps.

24
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,796
l gotta go to work.

25
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,515
Could you leave your board?
l may go out later.

26
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,276
My surfboard?

27
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,559
Yeah. You promised me last night.

28
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,712
Yeah, you can use it.

29
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,799
No tape delay. Here we are on open-line.
Good morning. You're on the air.

30
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,275
- Hi, Poorman.
- Where are you calling from?

31
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,675
- (woman) South Bay.
- What can l do for you?

32
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,318
Well, my boyfriend just left me and
l'm really bummed cos l loved him a lot.

33
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,749
Why did your boyfriend leave you?

34
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,952
He found me and his best friend
in bed together.

35
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,390
What do you expect if he found you
in bed with his best friend?

36
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,557
l don't know. Maybe a bit more
understanding, you know.

37
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,195
Well, you got a problem
that you're gonna have to work out.

38
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,356
But not on my show.

39
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,152
(DJ laughs)

40
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,471
l hate politicians.

41
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,476
(phone rings)

42
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,910
Yeah.

43
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,951
Coming to work today, Mr Taylor?

44
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,038
Yeah, Walt,
l'm flyin' out the door right now.

45
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,552
Let's see if my favourite
little stewardess is up yet.

46
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,071
Lookin' good.

47
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,235
Oops!

48
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,237
Busted.

49
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,950
Fly those friendly skies.

50
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,029
Now that is the perfect relationship.

51
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,670
Wait a minute. Hello.

52
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,555
What are you looking at, pal?

53
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,038
Good morning.

54
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,395
Time for that morning cup of hot java.
Coffee for one. Three scoops, please.

55
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,193
Nice selection of wines.

56
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,835
Good California Chardonnay,
a bottle of Dom.

57
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,793
No market brands in this house.

58
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,876
Only the best.

59
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,675
Now for some sliced papaya,
if it's in season.

60
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,757
Shit! Mango. l should have known.

61
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,396
l wish l knew your name.

62
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,589
Carl. l thought you were
gonna be a no-show.

63
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,075
Almost. Thanks.

64
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,796
Frost and Luzinski?

65
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,510
Yeah.

66
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,909
Hey, l don't know about you, shitheads,
but we're on a time clock. Let's move!

67
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,078
Gina walked out on me last night.

68
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,192
- Really?
- Yeah. Moved all her stuff out.

69
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,551
You've been trying to bale out
of that relationship for a long time.

70
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,148
(Carl) l just didn't expect it
to be so sudden.

71
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,676
Paybacks are a bitch, James!

72
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,309
- You seen my gloves, amigo?
- ln the glove compartimente.

73
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,233
- Hey, mister!
- Shut up, you dickhead.

74
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,751
Yes, l'm still here.
Now, about those mailers.

75
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,793
First off, you did the colours wrong,
but l let it pass because l'm a nice person.

76
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,390
Now you're telling me, with the
election one week around the corner,

77
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,432
that the mailers are gonna go out late?

78
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,157
lf you don't get those mailers out
by tomorrow, l'm pulling the account.

79
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,032
Bye-bye.

80
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,275
Jerk.

81
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,916
l gotta hide this.

82
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,833
- A ton of things need your signature.
- Can it wait?

83
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,270
No, and l have a cassette of a band
we could use for the fundraiser.

84
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,472
Since we're short on time,
you could listen and decide.

85
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,479
l don't have time for that. lf you like 'em,
use 'em. l trust your judgment.

86
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,354
That's why l hired you as a campaign
manager. You gotta trust your staff.

87
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,835
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

88
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,031
Listen...

89
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,118
- You're doing a hell of a job.
- Thank you, Jack.

90
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,079
- (Carl) l didn't sleep for shit last night.
- Why not?

91
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,599
Gina.

92
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,280
Gina, Gina. Gina!

93
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,915
Let her go, man. Let her go.

94
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,793
l have, l have. She is historical.

95
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,153
She couldn't be with
a garbageman the rest of her life.

96
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,239
You're not gonna be a garbageman.
Didn't you tell her about our surf shop?

97
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,239
l told her. l think she was getting
pressure from her family.

98
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,636
- Her father never liked you.
- What does he know?

99
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,116
- Well, life's a bitch, right?
- Ain't that the truth!

100
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,790
l tell you, Carl, this is
the last year we throw trash.

101
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,309
- You said that last year.
- This year l mean it.

102
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,396
You meant it last year.

103
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,599
- Hey, Carl, is this yours?
- No, it ain't my colour.

104
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,116
lt's a bra, James.

105
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,636
Look at this smut.

106
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,793
Well, if it isn't the South Bay's finest.

107
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,992
What happened, Mike?
Did they take away your vroom-vrooms?

108
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,272
You see, this is the kind of scum you're
gonna have to get used to around here.

109
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,551
Jeff's new to the force,
so l'm giving him the tour.

110
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,391
He's also my new partner, so you're
gonna be seeing a whole lot more of him.

111
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,750
Wonderful.

112
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,871
You're gonna like it here, Jeff.

113
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,117
The air's clean, the women are beautiful
and the shifts are short.

114
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,553
Most of the folks here in Las Playas
are hard-working, with a future in mind,

115
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,830
with the exception of these two clowns.

116
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,158
They're part of the
''Don't let this happen to you'' crowd.

117
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,113
A word of warning,
my garbage-toting friends,

118
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,993
from your friendly
neighbourhood peace officer.

119
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,079
l've got my eye on you both.
lf you're not breaking the law now,

120
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,193
the smart money says that
it's only a matter of time before you will.

121
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,269
And you can bet that last dollar that my
ass is gonna be there to make the bust.

122
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,237
- Golf clap?
- Golf clap.

123
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,391
''Dear John. l'm sorry
things didn't work out for us.''

124
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,717
''You're a sweet man,
and l'll always love you.''

125
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,353
Ah!

126
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,717
You know, this is the kind of shit
that really breaks me up.

127
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,796
- lt's an epidemic.
- What is?

128
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,071
Just women, relationships, all of it.

129
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,589
l never have a problem with it.

130
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,676
- Hi, James.
- Morning, baby.

131
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,194
- That's cos you've got no heart.
- What?

132
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,793
You've got no heart. Who was
the last girl you were serious about?

133
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,110
Betsy Sabetta.

134
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,199
Betsy Sabetta? That was
in the ninth grade and she had a harelip.

135
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,276
- She did not.
- She did too.

136
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,073
- She did not!
- Did too, did too.

137
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,317
- What do you know about her, anyway?
- l know she had a harelip.

138
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,832
What an absolutely gorgeous day.

139
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,315
Warm sun, beautiful women.

140
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,313
And the air is just right for drinking.

141
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,549
Would you just look at all the activity
that's going on down here, Carl.

142
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,116
lt's close, man. l can see it.

143
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,595
Right here, right on the strand.

144
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,188
Carl and James' Surf Shop.

145
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,993
lt's gold. lt's gold, James. lt's a gold mine.

146
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,352
Just think of the garbage business
as a way station on the road to nirvana.

147
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,439
Maybe now you're single again, you'll be
able to put more time and energy into it.

148
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,439
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on, wait a minute, just a second.

149
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,155
l have put a lot of energy
into getting our surf shop together.

150
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,558
And we'd be a lot further along
if l didn't have to do the work of two.

151
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,799
Pardon me? Let's not forget that l chose
the bank that we went to to get our loan.

152
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,990
We didn't even get the loan.

153
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,829
lt's not like you researched it. You picked
the name out of the Yellow Pages.

154
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,030
What exactly are...

155
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,355
Good God!

156
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,391
What exactly are you trying to say?

157
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:35,029
What l'm trying to say, James, is that
sometimes you are completely hopeless.

158
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,796
- Really?
- Yes.

159
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,715
- Hey, Carl.
- Yeah.

160
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,197
- What exactly did you mean by hopeless?
- l meant exactly what l said.

161
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,788
l still don't understand.

162
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,990
Well, let's examine the word.

163
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,989
Hope less. Less than hopeful.
That's what you are.

164
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,957
But am l majorly hopeless
or partially hopeless?

165
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,629
l would say majorly. Why do you ask?

166
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,593
- l'll try to change.
- No, you won't.

167
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,397
l need to talk to you, Leo.

168
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,397
Hi. Nice to see you.

169
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,034
l need your help on something, Leo.

170
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,472
l know who's responsible for
the toxic dumping off Las Playas,

171
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,795
and l'm kind of involved.

172
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,069
Jesus, Jack.

173
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,873
l just never thought it would go this far.

174
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,436
Look, it's all on the tape. Listen to this.

175
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,636
(music plays)

176
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,070
What is this? Some kind of a joke?

177
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,668
This is not the right tape.

178
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,155
She took the wrong tape!

179
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,354
- What are you talking about?
- The wrong tape!

180
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,799
Hey, wait a minute.

181
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,074
Come on. Let's do the nasty.

182
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,035
- Do we have to?
- Yeah, afraid so.

183
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,076
- Nasty!
- Nasty!

184
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,391
- Nasty!
- Nasty!

185
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,953
Yeah, Dalton here. Listen,
Jack Berger was in here earlier today.

186
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,959
Claimed he knew who was responsible
for those Las Playas offshore dumpings.

187
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,674
Claimed he had some kind
of a tape that could prove it.

188
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,157
l don't know. This might be nothing,
but l thought you should know.

189
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,719
You did the right thing, Captain. l'm sure
it's nothing, but l appreciate the call.

190
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,796
- Any time.
- Thank you.

191
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,198
A tape.

192
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,196
A goddamn tape.

193
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,070
Shrewd move, Berger.

194
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,879
Hey, boys! Where's your originality, huh?

195
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,957
This means war, man.

196
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,469
Hey, this is shit. lt's shit!

197
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,434
Get it off me, Frost! Get it off!
lt's shit! lt's shit!

198
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,233
lt's payback time, you little shits!

199
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,636
Gentlemen, inside now.

200
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,110
- What's up, Walt?
- Nothing too serious today.

201
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,074
l got a complaint about banging trash
cans on P Street at 6am this morning.

202
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,873
- You boys know anything about this?
- No, sir.

203
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,237
Who rolled the bowling ball
down the alley into Avenue H?

204
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,078
Can't help you there either.

205
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,634
ln the two years you have worked here,

206
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,719
you have broken every city ordinance
that pertains to this line of work.

207
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,513
Well, you can't say
we haven't been a lot of laughs.

208
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,359
l'm glad you have a sense of humour,
Mr St James.

209
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,234
Unfortunately, the majority
of the people in this community do not.

210
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,275
Now me, personally, l like you boys.

211
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,075
Which is why
l'm giving you another chance.

212
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,113
Starting tomorrow, you boys
will be riding with a third party.

213
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,276
What?

214
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,393
l have decided to send an observer
along with you on your route.

215
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,829
A representative of Shoreline.

216
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,713
- Who's the observer?
- My brother-in-law.

217
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,116
Consider yourselves on probation.

218
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,028
l suggest you be on your best behaviour.

219
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,471
The nerve of Walt, sending us
on our route with a goddamn baby-sitter.

220
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,556
Don't worry about it.

221
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,309
What does a... phrenologist
feel and interpret?

222
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,115
- The size of Walt's asshole.
- Wrong.

223
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,190
No, a phrenologist feels and interprets
the bumps on your head, skull features.

224
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,675
Very good.

225
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,271
Who was Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff
during the final days of Watergate?

226
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,675
Oprah Winfrey.

227
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,110
No, that was... Alexander Haig.

228
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,156
That's right.

229
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,796
What does gasoline...

230
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,638
(shouting)

231
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,194
(woman) Jack! Jack!

232
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,596
(Jack) The tape!
What did you do with the tape?

233
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,791
Jesus Christ!

234
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,918
- What are you doing?
- l hate shitheads who bully their women.

235
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,277
- So what are you gonna do?
- Shoot him.

236
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,470
- What?
- lt's the principle, James.

237
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,592
With a pellet gun? What are you
gonna accomplish using that?

238
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,188
lt allows me to seriously
aggravate a situation

239
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,073
without actually changing
the course of history.

240
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,760
lt also stings like a bitch.

241
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,277
Well, l'm glad that's over.

242
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,956
Carl, what are you doing?
Everything's cool now.

243
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,277
Mister, it's nothing personal.

244
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,635
- Where do you think you got him?
- Butt shot.

245
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,115
He'll never lay a hand on her again.

246
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,234
( aria from Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci'')

247
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,635
Asshole! l wouldn't have
voted for you anyway.

248
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,228
- Stop it! Stop it!
- What?

249
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,353
Shoot him in the head,
his head's all over the place.

250
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,430
Touchdown! The tape! Touchdown!

251
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,516
Genius.

252
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,995
Man, this guy's really heavy.
l gotta start working out.

253
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,680
- You should go to the gym.
- l hate weights.

254
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,439
- You work on your cardiovascular.
- What's that?

255
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,869
- Get on one of those life cycles.
- What's that?

256
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,560
- Stationary bike.
- Yeah? How are they?

257
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,708
They're great. They got... cross-country
skiing machines, things where you row.

258
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,638
Come on, get him in there. l wanna go eat.

259
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,796
Come on, come on, come on.

260
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,279
l got it. Start the car.

261
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,231
Right, Jack, l have the tape.

262
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,112
Jack?

263
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,115
Jack?

and l swear to God, l'll kill you.

269
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,956
What'd l do?

270
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,396
Let's go a little bit faster, see if
you can put me through the windshield.

Time for work. Boy, oh boy!

275
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,756
James, do us both a favour.

276
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,276
Whatever you do,

277
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,912
don't give this observer guy
a hard time today.

278
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,558
l figure if we behave ourselves,

279
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,393
show him that
we're a couple of good guys,

280
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,114
we'll get him out of our hair a lot quicker.

281
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,632
OK.

282
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,396
For all we know...

283
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,038
he could be some crazed combat veteran.

284
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,035
You're driving too fast.

285
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,835
So, Louis, you're Walt's brother-in-law.
That's great. Speaks highly of you.

286
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,951
What do you know about anything?

287
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,036
Walt's a nice guy.

288
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,120
His sister must be nice too.
l've never met her.

289
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,834
When l feel like talking to you,
l will look at you.

290
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,916
Gotcha.

291
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,792
You writing stuff about us? Sorry. Sorry.

292
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,556
This sucks.

293
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,596
What did you say, son?

294
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,676
The name is James.

295
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,909
Well, James,
if you expect to keep this job,

296
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,271
l suggest you tell me what it was
you were mumbling over there.

297
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,356
James.

298
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,799
l said this sucks.

299
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,876
And, basically, so do you.

300
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,716
(Louis chuckles)

301
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,357
You little... l'll show you
not to talk to me like that!

303
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,557
This Louis guy's a total nightmare.

304
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,036
He's not playin' around,
let me tell you, James.

305
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,680
Yeah, l feel really bad about that, Carl.

306
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,954
Probably not as bad as l do.

- What?

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,758
No matter what you do,
do not provoke this guy.

311
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,029
- Promise.
- l'm serious.

312
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,116
l promise.

313
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,998
- How's that nose?
- lt's OK.

314
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,633
l still owe one to the intended receiver.

315
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,069
You know, man,
you're a total pain in the a...

316
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,829
Now, James, Louis is gonna be with us
for the next couple of weeks.

317
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,837
Accept this as fact.

318
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,919
Why don't you guys shake hands
and stop behaving like children?

319
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,115
Put it on the back of your neck.

320
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,109
There are several sacred things in
this world that you don't ever mess with.

321
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,152
One of them happens to be
another man's fries.

322
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,955
Now, you remember that
and you'll live a long and healthy life.

323
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,989
(bones crack)

324
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,516
(mouths)

325
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,876
James.

326
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,911
- James.
- What?

327
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,474
You better get over here
and take a look at this.

328
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,955
What is it, Carl?

329
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,196
Just take a look.

330
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,559
- What the hell is this, Carl?
- lt's a dead human being, James.

331
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,831
Yeah? What's he doin' on our route?

332
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,829
Oh, looky here. Looks like somebody
threw away a perfectly good white boy.

333
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,115
And he sure looks
a hell of a lot like that dude.

334
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,156
We're screwed.

335
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,438
What do you mean ''we''?
You pulled the trigger, pal.

336
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,630
Look, Louis, we gotta talk.

337
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,433
You see, Louis,
Carl sort of knows this guy.

338
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,073
- So?
- l don't know him at all.

339
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,272
- What l'm trying to say is he shot him.
- With a pellet gun.

340
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,630
- But he thought he hit him in the butt.
- l did.

341
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,718
You two seem to be
in some serious shit here.

342
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,114
l need a drink.

343
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,676
Look, Louis, l know
that l did not kill this man.

344
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,237
This guy was beatin' on his old lady,
so l took upon myself to end the dispute.

345
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,476
- So you shot him?
- With a pellet gun.

346
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,556
So you said.

347
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,031
- And you shot him from where?
- From my apartment.

348
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,674
So how in the hell did he end up here?

349
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,756
Why don't you ask him?

350
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,317
- Have some. lt'll settle your nerves.
- My nerves don't need settling!

351
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,079
What is the maximum sentence
for murder?

352
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,988
l did not murder anyone! Jesus Christ,
James, whose side are you on?

353
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,078
- l am not taking sides.
- You've already convicted me.

354
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,316
l'm on my way to death row.

355
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,714
Carl, come on.

356
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,115
Let me tell you,
you are in it as much as l am.

357
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,993
You were there.
That makes you an accomplice.

358
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,396
Look, you bastard, l never
wanted you to do it. l was against it.

359
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,399
- Try explaining that to the judge.
- l'm not explaining anything to any judge.

360
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,353
- This is your ball game, Carl.
- You are an asshole!

361
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,631
- You are a trigger-happy idiot!
- l will not rot in prison alone.

362
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,877
You're not gonna mess up my life,
you son of a bitch!

363
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,228
Hey!

364
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,555
You and your stupid pellet gun!

365
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,516
- Get off of me!
- l'll kill you!

366
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,438
You're a stupid man!
You're a stupid little man!

367
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,154
l said enough! l said cut it out!

368
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,033
Hey, you! l said knock it off!

369
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,399
Now look, unless one of you two guys
took a piece of rope or a piece of wire

370
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,034
and strangled this guy,
you're both in the clear.

371
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,515
How the hell do you know?

372
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,149
You can tell by the marks on his neck.
Look at that.

373
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,714
Pretty sloppy job, too.

374
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,389
Not a great idea to keep him
out in the open like this.

375
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,479
l don't like this, Carl.
l don't like this one bit.

376
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,909
- l'm goin' to the cops.
- What?

377
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,996
Looks like they're comin' to us.

378
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,276
l hate cops.

379
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,111
Well, well. Another fine day
in the dumps, eh, fellas?

380
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,595
Who are your friends?
l've never seen you around here before.

381
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,676
Louis here works for the company.

382
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,316
He'll be ridin' with us for the next
couple of weeks to police our activities.

383
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,713
- ls that right?
- Yes, sir, Officer, sir.

384
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,070
- What about you?
- He's...

385
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,555
l didn't ask you, garbageman.

386
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,638
l'm asking the punk who looks like
he's had a few too many.

387
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,832
What the hell's the matter with him?
He looks friggin' dead.

388
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:15,036
Well, the boy's had a rough night.
He's, you know, a... cousin of James.

389
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,951
He flew in from... Texas. We were
out late showin' him a good time.

390
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,868
Wherever he's from, he shouldn't be
out on the street in his condition.

391
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,312
l could haul you in, you know. But for now
l'm just gonna give you a warning.

392
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,035
- That's very kind of you, Officer.
- Yeah, it is.

393
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,119
Get him inside that truck and make sure
he stays there until he sobers up.

394
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,232
- Do l make myself clear?
- Crystal, sir. Let's go.

395
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,476
Not so fast.

396
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,313
l've got the whole Las Playas police
department clued into you two bozos.

397
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,396
You may have escaped me this time,

398
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,149
and all l can say is
''Relish this moment, gentlemen.''

399
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,272
This is wrong. This is just wrong, wrong,
wrong! We should have just told them.

400
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,436
Told them what?

401
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,596
That we found a body in the trash

402
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,110
that just happened to be Jack Berger,
the man l shot with a pellet gun?

403
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,189
Are you nuts? Those guys are
lookin' for any excuse to put us away.

404
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,678
Let's get outta here. We'll stash the body,
get back to work and figure this out later.

405
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,360
Son of a bitch!

406
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,789
l can't believe this. We lost the body.

407
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,150
Hey, relax. We didn't lose the body.

408
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,078
lt's in a big yellow can.
How can we miss it?

409
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,316
What do you mean, you've lost the body?

410
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,750
lt just kind of fell out
of the back of the car.

411
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,074
Well.

412
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,670
- Find it! Find it, find it, find it, find it!
- Yes, sir.

413
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,439
Your very lives
depend upon it, gentlemen.

414
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,228
- What the hell are you waiting for?
- Sir, we did find the tape.

415
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,512
Oh.

416
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,196
Thank God.

417
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,276
You're excused.

418
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,236
(music plays)

419
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,590
- Wait a minute. The girl.
- What girl?

420
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,030
- The girl we saw Berger fighting with.
- What about her?

421
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,118
Well, maybe she had
something to do with his death.

422
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,392
Yeah, so she strangles him, stuffs him in a
barrel and dumps him on the esplanade?

423
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,954
lt makes a lot of sense, Carl.

424
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,236
You know...

425
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,560
That stiff's startin' to get a little gamy.
You guys come up with anything?

426
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,036
Carl seems to think that
Berger's girl is somehow involved.

427
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,188
The last time we saw Berger alive was
in that fight across from my apartment.

428
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,118
- lt's not enough to go on.
- lt's a place to start.

429
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,869
How about going to the police? What
we should have done in the first place.

430
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,639
Carl's right. lt's a place to start.

431
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,630
We're not gonna accomplish
a goddamn thing standing around here.

432
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,672
So you guys are either
with me or you're not.

433
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,800
l thought you knew how to rig that thing.

434
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,835
l followed the instructions.

435
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,750
(Louis) Anything good
to eat in this place?

436
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,476
- (Carl) l could order us a pizza.
- Sounds great. Pepperoni, extra cheese.

437
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,878
Maybe we should put old Milhous
someplace a little less visible.

438
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,675
l need a large pepperoni, extra cheese,

439
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,635
to 828 Esplanade, apartment 405.

440
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,035
Last name, Taylor.

441
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,116
Yeah.

442
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,276
OK, what's the total on that?

443
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,999
Hey, Carl.

444
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,153
Hello.

445
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,636
(Louis) She hardly looks like
a cold-blooded killer.

446
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,075
What now, hotshot?

447
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,509
How about goin' over there and tellin' her

448
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,599
that we got her boyfriend's
dead body sittin' in our shitter?

449
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,316
What are we gonna do?

450
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,070
Stand here watching her like
a bunch of long-distance Peeping Toms?

451
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,430
No.

452
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,949
- l'm goin' over there.
- (both) What?

453
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,150
- l'm goin' over there.
- What for?

454
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,068
l don't know. Snoop around,
see what l can come up with.

455
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,716
Carl, this is not some game. What if
she didn't have anything to do with this?

456
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,038
Gee, James, you sound as if
you're really worried about me.

457
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,709
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- l'm not gonna get in over my head.

458
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,832
Well, that depends on
which head you're talkin' about.

459
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,636
Look, we got your back. lf anything funny
happens, don't be too shy to scream.

460
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,513
OK. Save me a slice.

461
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,680
Do you know where
he keeps that gun of his?

462
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,990
What is he doing?

463
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,076
What am l doing?

464
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,916
Uh-oh.

465
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,078
- Don't kill me!
- What?

466
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,156
What? l'm sorry.

467
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,516
- Are you OK?
- l'm fine. l've never been better.

468
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,158
- Do you live here in the...
- l'm sorry if l...

469
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,236
You first.

470
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,069
- Do you live here in the building?
- Yes, l do live here in the building.

471
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,555
For five years l've been in the building.

472
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,558
That's funny.
l've never seen you here before.

473
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,717
Well, l lead a very... private life.

474
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,559
l'm a... a... phrenologist.

475
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,640
What exactly does a phrenologist do?

476
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,039
Well, l feel and interpret the size of
Walt's asshole... l mean, skull features.

477
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,276
Wow.

478
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,871
Not to impose, but if we can go inside and
put some ice on this ankle, it'd be great.

479
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,434
- lnside where?
- Your apartment.

480
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,516
What's the matter with yours?

481
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,077
No, my ice machine is broken,
and yours is right here.

482
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,591
Are you gonna refuse a wounded man
in dire need of medical attention?

483
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,316
- No.
- Thanks.

484
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,995
- But l didn't catch your name.
- l'm Ted Blanston, the third.

485
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,156
Susan Wilkins, the first.

486
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,317
(James) He's inside.
He's inside her apartment.

487
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,276
Out that light.

488
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,194
(Louis) What the hell's Carl doing?

489
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,790
- l don't like this, man. l do not like this.
- (Louis) Shh.

490
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,555
(James and Louis) Asshole!

491
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,798
The hell with this. l'm callin' the police.

492
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,075
No cops. l hate cops.

493
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,156
l'm sorry, which ankle was it?

494
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,516
lt's the swollen one.

495
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,718
- l really appreciate this.
- lt's no trouble.

496
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,200
Are you friendly with the Cottlers?

497
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,550
- l think...
- Second floor?

498
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,274
- Ron and Ann?
- Oh, sure.

499
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,073
Well, l figured, since you're both doctors.

500
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,430
Right. We're all doctors.

501
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,192
Where do you practise?

502
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,757
l got a small office down
in the medical district and...

503
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,474
You know, l could really use a drink.

504
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,716
- Just one.
- Me too.

505
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,276
Thanks.

506
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,712
- Sorry.
- l could have brought it to you.

507
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,677
Thank you.

508
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,755
lt's for the pain.

509
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,396
l rarely touch the stuff.
Can l have another one?

510
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,671
(James) l don't believe this.
They're doin' shots, for Christ's sake.

511
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,518
l can't believe l've never met you before.

512
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,717
l thought l knew everyone
who lived in this building.

513
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,877
Well, as l said, l lead a very private life.

514
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,036
Very private life. Yeah.

515
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,955
You know, you're a very beautiful woman.

516
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,273
No, l mean that. l've always thought so.

517
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,152
What do you mean, always?

518
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,319
What l meant was that
you've probably always been beautiful

519
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,069
and it's a shame that
l'm just now discovering this.

520
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,750
Oh.

521
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,519
l'm sorry. l didn't mean to embarrass you.

522
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,311
Well, you did.
You wanna switch to champagne?

523
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,231
Sure, if the Dom Perignon is chilled,
that'd be perfect.

524
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,715
How did you know l had Dom?

525
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,675
How did l know you had Dom?
Doesn't everybody?

526
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,714
- Where are you going?
- l'm going to the bathroom, Louis.

527
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,151
Jesus! Carl spends the evening
with a beautiful woman

528
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,556
and l'm stuck here
with a lunatic and a corpse.

529
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,830
(Louis) l don't believe this guy.

530
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,156
(hums)

531
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,875
l can't do this with you starin' at me.

532
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,994
(knocking)

533
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,680
- Who is it?
- Pedro's Pizza and Pancakes.

534
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,476
Yeah!

535
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,712
OK.

536
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,593
- Large pepperoni, extra cheese.
- That's us.

537
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,473
- How much?
- Eight bucks.

538
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,073
OK. One, two,

539
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,350
three, four...

540
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,274
- What's going on here?
- Mind your own business.

541
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,277
OK. Thank you, sir.

542
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,595
You've seen too much.

543
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,358
- What the hell are you doing?
- He saw you with the body.

544
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,438
- He could start trouble.
- So you kidnap him? Good solution.

545
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,757
Here, take the money.
l won't say anything to anybody!

546
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,632
You bet you won't!

547
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,716
What the hell?

548
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,190
Extra cheese?

549
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,677
- You're a madman.
- He was provoking me.

550
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,110
This situation has definitely
gotten way out of hand.

551
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,800
Get back to that window
and keep Carl covered.

552
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,959
- What the hell do we do with him?
- We need some rope.

553
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,556
(phone rings)

554
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,436
Are you gonna get this or what?

555
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,591
Hello?

556
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,429
First, you lose the body,

557
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,438
and then you deliver me the wrong tape.

558
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,552
Now, l don't think that
either of you personally

559
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,752
set out to destroy my company.

560
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,829
But l sent you out on a simple task.
And, simply put, you loused it up.

561
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,234
(imitates bird call)

562
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,874
Now, apparently,

563
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,676
Berger had a special relationship
with his campaign manager,

564
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,157
a Susan Wilkins, 825 Esplanade.

565
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,272
That's where we iced Berger, chief.
l know where that is.

566
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,789
Well...

567
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,118
Did it ever occur to you two idiots
that she might have the cassette?

568
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,076
(hangs up)

569
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,475
l think he wants us
to kill some more people.

570
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,033
OK.

571
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,156
lf l had my 16,
l could pick her off so easily.

572
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,073
(helicopters, gunfire)

573
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,794
This is good. Did you make it?

574
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,710
(woman) ..reporting from Hanoi Hilton.
Yankee dogs, you might as well give up.

575
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,673
The war is lost. Jane Fonda was right.

576
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,314
Are you hungry? Would you like some?

577
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,512
- Don't give him any, James.
- Why not? He might be hungry.

578
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,918
He's a prisoner,
and he should be treated accordingly.

579
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,275
Have you completely lost your mind?

580
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,358
We're not soldiers and he's not
the enemy. He's a pizza man.

581
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,436
Back in Phu Bai,

582
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,751
he would have been killed
the second he knocked on that door.

583
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,668
l would've snapped his neck like a twig.
He never would've seen it coming.

584
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,952
- Louis, Louis, calm down.
- The commie bastard gets no food!

585
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,479
- (Carl) Yeah.
- (Susan sighs)

586
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,875
(Carl) Yes, indeed.

587
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,230
That is deep.

588
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,316
That is definitely deep.

589
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,516
Yes.

590
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,830
Hm.

591
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,916
That's an interesting one.

592
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,956
So is that one.

593
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,995
You were born through Caesarean, no?

594
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,037
- No.
- lt's not an exact science, of course.

595
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,515
Apparently not.

596
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,713
Mangoes. You love mangoes.

597
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:36,036
- How did you know that?
- Well, it's all here in the contours.

598
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,916
Yeah.

599
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,114
So, that's phrenology.

600
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,356
lt's fascinating, no?

601
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,630
No. Weird.

602
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,719
You know what? First, let's take this off.

603
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,599
And let's do something.

604
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:00,999
- We are doing something.
- Let's get out of here and do something.

605
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,271
- Like what?
- l don't know, but it'll be fun.

606
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,278
Why this sudden burst of energy?
My ankle's killing me.

607
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,356
Come on.

608
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,116
- You want me to get this?
- Oh.

609
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,110
Do you always look in people's trash?

610
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,038
Well, sometimes it's the best way
to get to know 'em.

611
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:30,234
(James) No, no, no. l wanna report
a murder and a kidnapping.

612
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,510
- Murder and a kidnapping.
- That's right.

613
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,757
- Did they take the body?
- No, no, no. l have the body.

614
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,394
- Did you kill the victim?
- No, l didn't kill him.

615
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,990
- Have you been kidnapped?
- l'm not the one who's been kidnapped.

616
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,510
- l know this sounds strange...
- l don't think we can help you, sir.

617
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,428
Well, fuck me! lsn't that what the police
are supposed to do - help people?

618
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,676
- l am telling you...
- (line goes dead)

619
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,315
They're leaving. Let's go.

620
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,599
Dammit!

621
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,190
Let's move it! Come on!

622
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,677
The pizza clown goes with us.
Get him on his feet. l'll get Tricky Dick.

623
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,316
l want you to know, James,
this is all going on my report.

624
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,591
That's great, Louis.
Just make sure you spell my name right.

625
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,915
Don't cross me, James.

626
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,599
All right, let's whack this broad
and get the tape.

627
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,674
Jesus Christ. That's Berger.

628
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,076
What the hell?

629
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,436
Get back here, you goof.

630
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,677
- Who's the kid in the clown suit?
- l don't know.

631
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,554
Oh! Oh, God! Oh, Christ!

632
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,871
Those bastards are gonna pay.

633
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,956
Oh, yeah. They're payin'.

634
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,872
Yo!

635
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,118
There's the broad. There goes the broad.

636
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,874
Come on, come on, come on, you moron.

637
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,870
Are we late for something?

638
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,395
- Faster, James, faster.
- l got it to the floor, Louis.

639
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,515
- Who are those guys?
- How the hell am l supposed to know?

640
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,718
And where do these guys
get off, takin' our body?

641
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,475
Come on, we're losing 'em.

642
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,036
Oh, Christ.

643
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,508
- Oh, shit.
- l've almost been waiting for this.

644
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,996
Now you see this here?
This complicates things.

645
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,429
l just don't like killing cops too much.

646
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,711
Forget about the body.
They're the ones drivin' around with it.

647
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,072
l say we stay with the girl.
Potterdam says she might have the tape.

648
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,431
Biff, help me, all right.
Who just died and made you king?

649
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,677
Hey, Mario, how about this?
Your mother did.

650
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,429
Don't you ever say anything,
ever, about my mother.

651
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,199
Your mother did, your mother did. Mario!

652
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,033
- How do we handle this?
- Just pull over.

653
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,873
(James) OK, everybody. Act natural.

654
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,596
Well, well, well. Look who we got here.

655
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,031
l am in no mood for this right now, Mike.

656
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,118
Just write up the ticket
so we can all get on with our lives.

657
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,312
Well, l might not be able
to let you off so easy there, Jimbo.

658
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,672
See, you were doing 65 in a 35,
and you ran a red light.

659
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,471
That's reckless driving
as far as l'm concerned.

660
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,160
Who else you got
in there with you, Jimbo?

661
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,318
What the hell is going on in here?

662
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,473
You're... you're never
gonna believe this, Mike.

663
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,593
l... we, uh...

664
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,668
l'm totally floundering.
l can't even come up with a good lie.

665
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,109
What'd l tell you, James?

666
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,677
l knew you were crooked and l knew
l'd catch up to you sooner or later.

667
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,795
Everybody out of the vehicle right now.

668
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,831
- Don't do it!
- Don't shoot!

669
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,635
- He's got a gun.
- (James) Don't shoot! Please, don't shoot!

670
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,672
Yeah, cop. l know you, man.

671
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,839
l know what you're thinking. ''We got us
another crazy nigger here with a gun.''

672
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,397
Well, let me tell you, human life means
very little to me at this point in time.

673
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:38,435
You see, l thrive on misery.
ln the jungle, misery's all you got.

674
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,235
But things are different back here
in the world, or so they seem.

675
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,397
Nobody wants to talk about
pain and suffering.

676
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,593
Everybody wants
everything to be nice and civil.

677
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:55,158
Well, OK, then. Let's be nice. Let's be civil.

678
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,513
Drop those guns before l pull this trigger
and change the way you feel about me.

679
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,793
Will the officer to the rear of the truck
kindly drop his revolver as well?

680
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,508
You know, you cops must really think
l'm as dumb as you look.

681
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,519
Now, don't you know that
when a flashlight hits the cement,

682
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,076
it makes a completely
different sound than a revolver?

683
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,839
Let's be good boys,
and do exactly as l say.

684
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:43,679
OK, now, l want Mr Sneaky Man to come
around and join his partner, Mr Bonehead.

685
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,870
Sorry, guys.

686
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:02,430
You will swing for this, James.
l shit you not!

687
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:10,314
l don't know, boys, but they look
pretty goddamn sweet to me.

688
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,076
What do you think?

689
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,070
What do you think?

690
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,070
How you doing?

691
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,430
l'm OK.

692
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,155
l think my body's gone into shock
from all the alcohol.

693
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,236
l'd like to sit down, actually.

694
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,316
What was that for?

695
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,996
You didn't like it.

696
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,315
No, l liked it... a lot.

697
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,396
Then shut up.

698
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,035
lt feels like we're drivin' in circles.
Carl could be anywhere.

699
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,754
( ''Reggae Ambassador''
by Third World)

700
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,516
You want some?

701
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,114
Promise you're not gonna scream
and cry if l take that gag off?

702
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,914
Now, if you're lyin',
Louis'll have to bash you.

703
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,996
You do understand, don't you?

704
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,956
Thank you. Thank you.

705
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,473
- lt needs sugar.
- What?

706
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,556
Nothing.

707
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,196
lt's not lookin' too good, is it?

708
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,558
- You givin' up?
- l never give up.

709
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,715
l never have. Never once, James.

710
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,037
l'm gonna take us back
along the esplanade.

711
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,517
- Feels like a long shot to me.
- At this point, everything's a long shot.

712
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,919
l can't see anything.
Frost, gimme some light.

713
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,350
This is just a little uncool, Luzinski.

714
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,029
Our brouhaha is with Carl,
not with the chick.

715
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,277
l'm just makin' a simple adjustment -
nothing major.

716
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,279
Shake 'em up a little bit.
Now, can l have some light, please?

717
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,873
Thank you.

718
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,560
- Come on, come on. Hurry up.
- Oh, yeah.

719
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:31,558
Now let's find James, and teach
that simple bastard a lesson too.

720
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,470
Hiya, kids. Are we having fun?

721
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,114
- Ted, what's happening?
- Who the hell are you?

722
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,913
Hey, shut up, you!

723
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,031
What the hell is that?

724
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,991
- lt's a Taser.
- A what?

725
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,953
A Taser. 65,000 volts of electricity.

726
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,915
lt completely incapacitates the victim
without killing him. l got it on sale.

727
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,871
Let's move it. Let's go.

728
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,956
Put your hands up.

729
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,872
Ted, you should do something.

730
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,037
lf you come up with any ideas,
please let me know.

731
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,390
We have the right to know
what's going on.

732
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,274
Hey, put a cork in it, sister.
You have no more rights.

733
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,039
And you, buying a goddamn laser gun.

734
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,037
- Taser.
- Whatever.

735
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,073
- You've always gotta be so different.
- l'm in no mood. Just lay off.

736
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,590
- No, you gotta be creative.
- l said lay off.

737
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:35,033
- When l say ''now'', start running.
- (men continue arguing)

738
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,550
You're an amazing man.
You know shit about absolutely nothing.

739
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,114
Now l've just heard everything.

740
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,878
Hold it, honey.

741
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,356
You listen to me, you ltalian
son of a bitch, and you listen good.

742
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,870
The day you tell me l don't know shit
and l let you get away with it

743
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,834
- is the day that that ocean freezes over.
- That's it. You're over.

744
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,116
Now!

745
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,709
- That's my car!
- Looks pretty undriveable. Come on!

746
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,274
Come on, let's go!

747
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,992
Ted!

748
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:29,072
- Ted, what the hell's going on?
- l left out a couple of things about myself.

749
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,954
- l'm waiting, you son of a bitch.
- First, my name isn't Ted. lt's Carl.

750
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,640
From now on when you yell for me
in a panic, yell Carl.

751
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,318
There's more?

752
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,637
Last night you and Jack Berger
had a fight in your apartment.

753
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,991
How the hell could you
have possibly known that?

754
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,759
Look, Susan, l don't live in your building.

755
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,350
l am a garbageman.
l live across the street from you.

756
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,994
l have been watching you
every day for six weeks.

757
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,476
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.
You have been spying on me?

758
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,717
- l don't really consider it spying.
- What do you consider it?

759
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,877
Let me finish! You and Jack
had a fight, you left angry.

760
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,639
The next morning
l found Berger's body in the trash.

761
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,069
- Jack's body?
- Somebody killed him, Susan.

762
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,714
- For a while l thought it was you.
- Jack is not dead.

763
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,594
- Jack was at my apartment last night.
- Trust me, Jack is dead.

764
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,632
Jack came over because
there was some mix-up with a tape

765
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,719
and l went down to my car to get
the right tape and... The tape, the tape.

766
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,628
This is what had Jack so worked up.
We gotta get this to the police.

767
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:30,116
- What the hell was that for?
- For lying to me. l hate liars!

768
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,353
Hates liars?

769
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,155
That's for spying on me!

770
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,393
Come on!

771
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,116
(groans)

772
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,998
What happened?

773
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:58,271
lt was something.
You got struck by lightning.

774
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,712
- Really?
- A freak storm.

775
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,316
- Police!
- Thank God.

776
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,670
- Police!
- Hello!

777
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,756
Over here, by the playground.

778
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,636
Ew.

779
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,073
Sorry, guys.

780
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,716
Wait! lt's not what it looks like.
Please, give us a hand.

781
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,638
No, l'm really not into it, but thanks.

782
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,515
Carl! Come on, Carl. Everything
l ever said about you, just kidding.

783
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,596
He was.

784
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,636
You're not really gonna leave us here,
are you? That would be...

785
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,549
- Come on, come on, already!
- About a thousand keys here.

786
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,076
- Try this one.
- l'm trying.

787
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,274
Hey, hey, hey!

788
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,277
- l got it!
- (Biff) Look out.

789
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,596
lt's my turn, asshole!

790
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,557
- What is he doing?
- What are you doing?

791
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,398
- l'm crashing!
- Down!

792
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,556
l'm back.

793
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,116
Let's go, honey.

794
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,837
Chief, we got 'em. We found 'em.

795
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:34,318
Allow me to introduce myself.
l'm Maxwell Potterdam the third.

796
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,876
Maybe you've heard of me. California
magazine just did a piece on me.

797
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,037
With the exception of being
misquoted several times,

798
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,277
l thought it was a pretty good article.

799
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,757
Anyway, all that is... unimportant.

800
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,071
This... is what's important.

801
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,919
Let's put these folks in the car

802
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,589
and go someplace a little more noisy.

803
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,916
Come on, move it.

804
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,632
Hey.

805
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,399
That's them. Getting into that limo.

806
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,833
- What the hell's goin' on?
- l don't know, but we're gonna find out.

807
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,275
l knew this was gonna get heavy.

808
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,193
A lot of good this thing is gonna do us.

809
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:07,999
A pellet gun? You've been holding me
hostage all night with an air rifle?

810
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,509
- Shut up.
- This is too much.

811
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,555
We gotta find a way in there.

812
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,429
l... l got a plan.

813
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,031
That oughta do them.

814
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:30,709
l would love to see
those bastards try and top this.

815
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:36,039
l would pay a million pesos to see their
faces when they try to stop this baby.

816
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,596
Hey, pal, the next time
we see Carl and James,

817
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:43,269
it's gonna be Walt
handing them their walking papers.

818
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,755
(clinking)

819
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,838
(whispers) Somebody's coming.

820
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,154
(mouths)

821
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,836
(James) Come on!

822
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,392
- Come on, move it. Get up there.
- (pizza man) OK, l'm going.

823
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,592
We do live in extraordinary times.

824
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,792
The lengths one has to go
to get the job done.

825
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,356
You're destroying the environment
and you don't even care.

826
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,870
How do you do it?
How do you live with yourself?

827
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,956
Gentlemen.

828
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,309
Although l'd prefer to dump you

829
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,910
along with the rest of this waste
at the bottom of the Pacific,

830
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:52,238
recent disruptions in our operation
have created a problem,

831
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:57,912
and now the Las Playas landfill
will become your final resting place.

832
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,634
- Buried alive?
- Not to worry.

833
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,878
You'll probably run out of oxygen
before we reach the dump site.

834
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,478
Seal 'em up.

835
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,272
(Susan) No!

836
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,675
(muffled shouting)

837
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,115
Hold on, everyone!

838
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,755
Hey!

839
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,394
Something's wrong. We're not stopping.

840
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,875
- What?
- We're not stopping!

841
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,428
Aaargh!

842
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,238
- What the hell was that?
- Move your ass and find out.

843
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,069
No, you two stay.
l want those barrels sealed. You two.

844
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,988
- Everybody all right?
- (Louis) Yeah.

845
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,076
Oh, shit.

846
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,516
Get off of me.

847
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,916
Come on, let's go.

848
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,077
No, no, no. No, no, no.

849
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:51,320
l am not some kind of comic-book
superhero. l'm a pizza man.

850
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,958
- Stay here and keep an eye on him.
- Yeah, right.

851
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,675
l want the trucks moving immediately.

852
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,349
l want every goddamn drop of waste
dumped before the sun rises.

853
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,436
OK, Mr Potterdam.

854
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,798
(muffled shouting)

855
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,188
Go this way!

856
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,519
Jesus!

857
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,914
Holy shit!

858
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,472
(driver) All right,
l'll pick it up on my way back.

859
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,836
- Hi, Carl.
- Hi, James. How are you?

860
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,596
Never better.

861
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,756
Susan! Come on.

862
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,870
(Carl) Come on! We can't lose 'em!

863
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,757
- (James) We're not gonna make it.
- We'll make it.

864
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,516
(police siren)

865
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,276
South Bay Security. Freeze!

866
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,269
Rent-a-cops. l hate rent-a-cops too.

867
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,357
Carl! What the hell are we doing?

868
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,596
l think l love this girl.

869
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,995
Really? How do you know?

870
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,873
She let me feel the bumps on her head.

871
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,956
(both) Whoa!

872
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,835
- (Carl) lt looks like the bolt broke!
- No shit!

873
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,590
- Hang on.
- OK.

874
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,031
Trees! Trees!

875
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,431
- Carl!
- What?

876
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,199
- How you doin' over there?
- Piece of cake.

877
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,796
- You need help.
- (growls)

878
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,075
Carl!

879
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,356
James!

880
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,235
Hey, Carl!

881
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,396
l think l got a problem over here.

882
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,557
All right, let me think of something.

883
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,074
Hey, James, l didn't think of anything yet.

884
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,192
Hey, Carl! l definitely
got a problem over here!

885
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,516
l'm coming.

886
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,316
(crash)

887
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,956
Mr Potterdam?

888
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,233
We're lookin' pretty outnumbered here.

889
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,840
l got an idea. Follow me.

890
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:32,834
- What the hell are you doing?
- Protecting the environment.

891
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,956
- Freeze.
- What are you...

892
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,670
Everybody freeze or l blow his head off!

893
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,472
- He'll do it.
- l'm not kiddin'.

894
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,158
- Don't push him.
- l mean it.

895
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,349
His whole head.

896
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,392
You two with the weapons,
over the side. Do it now!

897
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,390
Yeah, man, l know you.

898
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,991
l know what you're thinking. ''We got us
another crazy white boy with a gun.''

899
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:16,750
Well, let me tell you, human life means
very little to me at this point in time.

900
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,519
(police siren)

901
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,880
Relax, James, the cops are here.

902
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,516
This is the police.
You all drop those weapons.

903
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,398
Yeah. Yeah, you!
You there with the pellet gun,

904
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,149
drop it or l'll blow
your butt away for sure, buddy.

905
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,113
(garbled arguing)

906
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:56,951
A pellet gun? Do you think we'd use
a pellet gun for something like this?

907
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,991
Get 'em!

908
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,511
l gotta find Susan.

909
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,952
Susan!

910
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,512
Susan!

911
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,313
Uh-oh.

912
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,791
Stop 'em before they get away!

913
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,713
Susan! Susan!

914
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,836
Susan!

915
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,115
(Susan) Help!

916
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,837
Susan.

917
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,195
Ow! Oh!

918
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,155
- Where are we?
- You don't wanna know.

919
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,833
(James) Carl! Carl, over here! Get down!

920
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,478
Come on. Move out.

921
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,516
Move! Everybody in the car.
