10
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:22,993
We cannot hide our ways any longer.

11
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:24,206
Nor should we.

12
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:28,188
The Ori have amassed armies
that move to destroy us.

13
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:32,226
Everything we believe
or we are is an affront to them.

14
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,558
They will stop at nothing to destroy
every last shred of evidence

15
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,594
that opposes their fanaticism.

16
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:38,982
We have no choice.

17
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:40,599
We have tried to argue reason.

18
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,021
We can fight,

19
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:44,155
use what we know to oppose them.

20
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,453
We are so few compared to them.

21
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:48,172
<i>The Ark can change everything.</i>

22
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:51,027
Is forced indoctrination
really the answer?

23
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:53,699
You would deny the Ori
the very essence of self.

24
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,270
It is no different
than the murder they propose.

25
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,899
<i>The only moral way
to change someone's mind,</i>

26
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:01,184
make them see the truth as you put it,

27
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:02,932
is to present evidence.

28
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:05,668
<i>We believe
in the systematic understanding</i>

29
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:07,119
<i>of the physical world through</i>

30
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,634
observation and experimentation, through

31
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:15,118
argument and debate,
but most of all, freedom of will.

32
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:17,582
I will not compromise

33
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:20,020
the fundamental tenets of my devotion

34
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,079
in order to preserve it.

35
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:27,993
We acknowledge the incredible potential
of the technology of the Ark.

36
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:29,553
And the danger

37
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,219
such power presents.

38
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,060
It will not be used
as a weapon against the Ori.

39
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:36,959
The debate on the issue is closed.

40
00:03:58,765 --> 00:03:59,914
Give me a hand?

41
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,839
You really think this is it?

42
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:27,267
Well,

43
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:29,632
it's covered in Ancient writing.

44
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,301
These symbols here are a part
of the oldest dialect I'm aware of.

45
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:33,266
It says

46
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:35,239
"... safely kept is the
something of old."

47
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,310
What's the something, Daniel?

48
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,138
Well, if I knew for sure,
I wouldn't have said the something...

49
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,999
- Why am I answering her?
- Stop your yammering and open it.

50
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:45,879
- We can't just open it.
- Why not?

51
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:47,372
<i>{\Well, i}If this is what I think it is,</i>

52
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:49,263
<i>it's a powerful piece
of Ancient technology</i>

53
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,479
capable of making anyone
who looks into it believe

54
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,901
that the Ori are not gods.
As far as we know.

55
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:56,159
But we already believe that.
No harm done, open it.

56
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,799
{\I said "as far as we know". There may be other things it's capable of making you believe.}As far as we know. Maybe
it can make you believe other things.

57
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:00,692
Maybe, we're supposed to believe
{\those other things}them too.

58
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:03,504
{\You know, t}That's beside the point, there's
another reason we can't just open it.

59
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,959
<i>Look at my hands, all right?</i>

60
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,962
They are raw and bleeding.
I've broken every nail.

61
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,729
We've been out here
in the scorching heat for days.

62
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:13,079
- I haven't showered.
- None of us have.

63
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:15,076
That is painfully obvious.

64
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:16,808
Now, according to you,

65
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:18,519
this crusty old chest

66
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:22,186
is our salvation from oppression
at the hands of the Ori army.

67
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:23,932
Our best, and maybe,

68
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,967
only remaining chance that we have.

69
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:28,068
We have dug
how many holes in the ground?

70
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:30,307
- Help me out here, Muscles.
- Many.

71
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,344
<i>Now, all the years
the Jaffa were here,</i>

72
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:35,359
<i>they knew{\ that} Dakara was the first landing
place of the Alterans in this galaxy.</i>

73
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:37,959
You mean to tell me they never looked
for Ancient artefacts?

74
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,399
There were a few artefacts
that were excavated

75
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:42,479
<i>and catalogued
when the city was being rebuilt.</i>

76
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,079
But, with the constant change
of leadership, little time or manpow...

77
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,426
Bla bla bla.

78
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:49,369
But here we are.

79
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:52,546
Finally. We may have found it:
The Ultimate Weapon.

80
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,486
So could someone{\ please}
explain to me why we can't

81
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:56,574
confirm our blessed fortune
by simply opening it?

82
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,560
Because it's sealed shut.

83
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,479
It definitely won't open.

84
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,024
Why didn't you say so?

85
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:12,199
<i>{\Well, }I was trying to
but you wouldn't stop your yammering.</i>

86
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:16,913
No no! You can't do that! I told you
this is a piece of technology.

87
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,116
You could damage it.

88
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:19,874
It's been buried for millions of years.

89
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:20,960
<i>Quiet!</i>

90
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,239
What?

91
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,585
<i>Hey, kids! Guess what?</i>

92
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:28,239
<i>We are under fire!</i>

93
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:53,119
I do not remember sending out
invitations to this party.

94
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:03,309
We have to fall back!

95
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:17,999
Move ahead!

96
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:26,213
What are you doing?
We have to go there.

97
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,178
We know.

98
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,339
There's too many of them.

99
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:32,039
- There's no other way out of here.
- We know!

100
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:33,959
How about now?

101
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:35,756
Yeah, "now" works for me.

102
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,943
Commander, we have them trapped.

103
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,318
Vala, it's Tomin.

104
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:58,384
<i>Put down your weapons and surrender,</i>

105
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,405
<i>and I promise you'll all be spared.</i>

106
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:01,609
That's funny.

107
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:04,912
I was just about
to say the same thing!

108
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,519
Vala, you have to trust me. Your
position has been targeted from space.

109
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:11,719
<i>Comply now or you will be destroyed!</i>

110
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:14,159
I think we have to trust him.

111
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:15,157
Jackson?

112
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,599
What if we got them to open it?

113
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,047
Well it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world, would it?

114
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:30,531
All right.

115
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:32,871
Invite him in.

116
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,679
You can come in.

117
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:51,788
I look like crap.

118
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:09,937
Hi!

119
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,270
How are you?

120
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,188
What's new?

121
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,873
What are you doing here?

122
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:32,177
<i>We really are on the same page.</i>

123
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,797
Took the words right out of my mouth.

124
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,279
How did you know we were here?

125
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:42,432
The power of the Ori
need not be questioned.

126
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,890
Oh... Here we go.

127
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:55,439
Tell me.

128
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,357
What is this artefact you have found?

129
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:00,319
<i>Hang on a second.</i>

130
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:02,959
Shouldn't you know that, already?

131
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:06,433
Your logic.

132
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:08,839
<i>No, wait, wait.
No need to be difficult here.</i>

133
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,914
You wanna know what it is?
I'll tell you.

134
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:14,639
Inside this Ark is a secret
to destroying the armies of the Ori.

135
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,209
And I think the last thing
you wanna do is to open it.

136
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:20,959
You think I fear the content?

137
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,759
I'm saying you really should.

138
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:24,799
Open it!

139
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:28,873
- You didn't hear what I just said?
- Open it!

140
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:35,401
It's sealed shut.

141
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:39,432
Wait, no!

142
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:05,107
Not what I was expecting.

143
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:09,480
Foolhardy are those
who do not follow the path.

144
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:11,839
Anyone wanna bet
what he's gonna say next?

145
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,644
Kill them.

146
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:15,399
I could have made money on that one.

147
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:18,789
Prior!

148
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,894
I gave them my word,
if they surrendered peacefully,

149
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,734
<i>- they would be spared.
- Your word...?</i>

150
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:26,422
- {\The word of the Ori is all that matters!}Only the word of the Ori matters!
- The Book of Origin says the truth

151
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:27,906
is the begining of the path...

152
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:30,955
Tomin, I grow tired
of your questioning!

153
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:33,054
Kill them now or you shall burn

154
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:35,770
in a fire of everlasting torment.

155
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:41,567
<i>Don't do it.</i>

156
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,359
He can't hurt you, Tomin.

157
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:46,760
We trusted you.

158
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:49,337
Trust me now.

159
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:53,686
- Fire your weapon!
- You think he's testing you.

160
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:55,337
Really he's forcing you to do it

161
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:58,284
because he's realized that for
some reason beyond his comprehension,

162
00:11:58,443 --> 00:12:00,199
he's completely powerless.

163
00:12:00,848 --> 00:12:01,839
Kill them!

164
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,119
<i>Kill them now!</i>

165
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:08,919
I command you!

166
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:14,497
Stop! Do not fire!

167
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:29,203
How?

168
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:30,379
Here.

169
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,771
We can show you.

170
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,581
We use this device.

171
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:43,599
It temporarily neutralizes
their abilities.

172
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:01,288
<i>According to Tomin,</i>

173
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,198
the Ori crusade is planning to send

174
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:06,430
a new wave of ships
through the Supergate sometimes soon.

175
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:08,954
The coordinated attack on Earth
may be imminent.

176
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,478
It's a little non specific.

177
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:15,571
That's why I suspect the Priors release
details on a need-to-know basis.

178
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,712
Shame you didn't find the real Ark.

179
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:20,199
Yes, Sir.
But not for lack of trying.

180
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:22,402
No other useful intelligence?

181
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:25,012
Well, at the moment,
Tomin is coming to grips with the fact

182
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:27,860
that he's devoted his life
to serving false gods.

183
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:29,363
Great.

184
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:31,597
What does he want?

185
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,460
Who is that?

186
00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:36,987
Come on in.
You might as well meet him.

187
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:42,759
<i>General.</i>

188
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:45,803
Colonel Mitchell.
I recognized you from your file.

189
00:13:45,988 --> 00:13:48,896
Mitchell, this is James Merek.
IOA oversight.

190
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:52,714
I'm a huge fan, Colonel.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

191
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:55,665
What happened to Woolsey?

192
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:58,064
His time has been taken out
by the Atlantis expedition.

193
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:00,479
Which, quite frankly,
I'm grateful for.

194
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:02,879
It is a thrill for me to be here.

195
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:07,279
You have been doing such an incredible
job under such difficult circumstances.

196
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:10,342
I don't think this gonna be much
for me to do here other than...

197
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,999
stay out of your way.

198
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,679
What do you want?

199
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,197
I believe protocol requires me
to notify you

200
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:18,761
that I will be interrogating
the prisoner personally.

201
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:19,845
<i>What prisoner?</i>

202
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:22,931
I believe your report
refers to him as Tomin.

203
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:24,439
No last name.

204
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:26,969
Right. Sorry, I...

205
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:30,775
I get confused. See,
we were thinking of him more as a guest.

206
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,687
Of course.
My mistake.

207
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:39,124
I trust the enemy commander
hell-bent on our total annihilation

208
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,919
has been given comfortable quarters.

209
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,159
Yeah, he's had a change of heart.

210
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:45,290
Come on, Colonel.

211
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:47,919
Don't all bad guys say that
after we capture them?

212
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:50,192
Actually, he captured us,

213
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:51,879
and then, he surrendered.

214
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,319
And my people have already
questioned the man.

215
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:57,011
No, I see. Look,

216
00:14:57,342 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:00,685
I really don't wanna step
on any toes here.

218
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:04,273
My superiors have asked me to prepare
a report on this matter personally,

219
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:06,406
and I don't want to disappoint them.

220
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:08,679
You know, me being new
in my job and all.

221
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
You understand.

222
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:12,963
Of course.

223
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:17,119
<i>Thanks so much.
I can't tell you how exciting it is</i>

224
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:19,215
for me to be working here with you.

225
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:22,559
Actually, I used to do what you do,
Colonel, so I know exactly how it feels.

226
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,399
<i>I'm sure you know
I'm just trying to do my job.</i>

227
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,039
Thank you, Mr Merek.

228
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:29,438
General.

229
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:30,641
Colonel.

230
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:42,743
He used to do what

231
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:44,012
I do.

232
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:46,380
What{\ the hell} does that mean?
What's his background?

233
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,599
Former CIA. Black ops.

234
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,818
Oh great! So the IOA is...

235
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,434
having one of our own spies
spy on us.

236
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,959
I have no doubt
the IOA chose him carefully.

237
00:15:56,937 --> 00:16:00,082
Why do I get the feeling
we're gonna miss Woolsey?

238
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:05,159
The Ori are dead and gone.

239
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,879
As we said,
we don't exactly know for sure.

240
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:10,119
We know we sent
a weapon to the Ori galaxy

241
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,759
that was supposed to be
capable of destroying them.

242
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,308
But not those that worship them.

243
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:24,153
No. Not humans.
Just the ascended beings.

244
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:28,920
I know it sounds complicated
but the point is, unless we stop it,

245
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:31,060
this holy crusade
in the name of the Ori

246
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,181
could end in a bloody mess
for all humans.

247
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:35,111
A futile bloody mess.

248
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:37,470
And your hope is that this Ark
will convince those

249
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,328
that still believe in the Ori
to stop believing as they do.

250
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:42,921
In Ancient,
it's called "Armiria Veremas",

251
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:45,679
that loosely translated,
means the Ark of Truth.

252
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,599
I know I have no right to say this,
it just seems wrong.

253
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,853
Oh hey... I'm not saying it's right.
I mean,

254
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:53,431
obviously Alterans didn't think
it was morally right to use it

255
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:55,117
or we wouldn't be in this situation.

256
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:57,118
But compared to the bloodshed
we may be facing.

257
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:59,660
We think the Ark may be capable
of brainwashing people

258
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:01,959
to believe whatever it's programmed
to make them believe.

259
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:04,118
But how did you know where to look?

260
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,335
We didn't.

261
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:09,289
That chest we found
was obviously not the Ark.

262
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,039
But still you must have had some idea.

263
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,899
I've had a vision several times.

264
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:29,079
<i>Daniel shared his mind with
the former Alteran named Merlin</i>

265
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,988
for a short time.

266
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:34,055
<i>His consciousness is gone{\ now}, but he was
the one who helped me build the device</i>

267
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:36,110
<i>that was sent to eliminate the Ori.</i>

268
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:37,200
<i>We hope.</i>

269
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,517
We think that these visions might be
remnants of Merlin's memories,

270
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:44,423
left behind intentionally to steer us
in the direction of the Ark.

271
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:48,718
And you think I'm crazy
for believing in the Ori.

272
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:51,389
You're not crazy, Tomin. Just...

273
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:53,559
wrong.

274
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,279
You've both read the Book of Origin,
have you not?

275
00:17:58,441 --> 00:17:59,398
Yes.

276
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:02,038
Do you not remember
the part about Ortus Mallum?

277
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:04,888
You've got to forgive me,
I don't know it by heart.

278
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:08,039
Book with fine printing,
not many pictures.

279
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:12,759
Ortus Mallum
is the birth place of all evil.

280
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,036
The passage speaks of a mountain
that erupts and buries the place

281
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:18,092
where all evil once sprang forth.

282
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:22,482
Look, I only ask because you mentioned
a mountain that explodes in your vision.

283
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,207
Amelius, what are you doing?

284
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:42,542
It's time to go.

285
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:43,863
I know.

286
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,907
They have to know the truth.

287
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:52,711
They will find nothing.

288
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:54,323
All will be destroyed.

289
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:02,949
My notebook.

290
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:12,459
I had the most amazing idea last night.

291
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:48,484
Well, we think we could use
the ZPM on board the Odyssey.

292
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:50,443
Unfortunately,
it's nowhere near enough power

293
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:52,617
to sustain an outgoing wormhole
indefinitely.

294
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:55,787
I take it doing the whole Pegasus thing
again is not an option.

295
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:59,547
<i>The fact is we were lucky to avoid the
attack from the Wraith the first time.</i>

296
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,183
<i>However, using the Odyssey,</i>

297
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:03,975
we believe we can beam
4 Mark-9 nuclear devices

298
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:07,378
strategically in between
the Supergate's individual segments.

299
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:08,927
Hopefully, undetected,

300
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:11,187
they'll be triggered
by any inbound Gate activation.

301
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:15,092
The resulting explosion should,
theoretically, create a chain reaction

302
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:17,689
that will essentially utilize
the massive amounts of energy

303
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:21,032
being channeled into the Gate
from the dialing galaxy, to destroy it.

304
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:24,558
Don't blow it up just yet.
We may still need that Supergate.

305
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:25,790
Dr. Jackson.

306
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,456
The Ancients didn't bring the Ark with
them, Sir. It's still in the Ori galaxy.

307
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:54,425
Okay, then.

308
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:01,697
I just need to get a few things
straight here, for the record.

309
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:02,910
Okay?

310
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,131
Shouldn't be that hard.

311
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:09,114
So...

312
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,224
- you're a commander in the Ori army.
- I was.

313
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:13,397
Yes, was.

314
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:15,876
Of course.

315
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:17,576
So...

316
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:21,097
your duties as a commander involved...

317
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:23,502
Following the orders of the Priors,

318
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:27,520
supervising the warriors
under my command.

319
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:28,970
Well...

320
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,744
good.

321
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:32,347
See?

322
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,753
No big deal.

323
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,091
Okay, moving on.

324
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:41,380
In the time that you've been here in our
galaxy, how many innocent human beings

325
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,472
would you say you slaughtered?

326
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,603
I'm talking personally here.

327
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:50,169
I'm sure you didn't keep
a running tally.

328
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:52,976
So maybe you could just give me
a general estimate.

329
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:54,715
Hundreds? Thousands? More?

330
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:58,342
- What do you want from me?
- I just want you to answer my questions

331
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:00,610
and I have quite a few.

332
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:04,437
They cover things like your plans,
your tactics, your numbers, training...

333
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,186
anything that might help us in defending
against the attack that you say

334
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:11,002
is coming. How many innocent human
beings would you say you slaughtered,

335
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,829
because they chose
not to believe in the Ori?

336
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:24,159
Where's Vala?

337
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:26,595
She could not bear to watch.

338
00:22:27,024 --> 00:22:28,607
Did you hear the plan?

339
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,346
Tomin wishes to accompany us.

340
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:35,442
He believes he can help us establish
contact with the anti-Ori underground.

341
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:40,032
He may be in fact the best way to figure
out what Ortus Mallum actually is.

342
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,275
Well, we can definitely use
all the help we can get,

343
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:46,256
assuming of course the Ori
are actually dead.

344
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:49,740
Or this could be a very short mission.

345
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:51,276
Indeed.

346
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:55,576
- General.
- Colonel.

347
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:58,099
I was just giving
Dr. Jackson the good news.

348
00:22:58,219 --> 00:22:59,873
The mission's been approved.

349
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:01,804
I thought it was already approved.

350
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,002
<i>Actually,</i>

351
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:06,689
no mission is approved until
the IOA officially signs off on them.

352
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,260
You've been given
temporary command of the Odyssey

353
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,039
for the duration of this operation.

354
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:14,999
Sir, does that mean
I have to sit in the chair?

355
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,192
That it does.

356
00:23:17,324 --> 00:23:19,318
And I wish the fun ended there.

357
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:21,147
<i>Sir...</i>

358
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,519
Mr Merek will be overseeing
the mission.

359
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,332
Personally, I'm excited.

360
00:23:29,662 --> 00:23:30,832
Yeah, me too.

361
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:33,456
That's to be my first time
on one of our battle cruisers.

362
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,021
See you on board, Colonel.

363
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:36,951
Dr. Jackson.
General.

364
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,175
Can I confine him to quarters?

365
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:46,240
It's your call, Colonel.

366
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,719
One of the decisions those of us
in command have to make.

367
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:54,347
Thank you, Sir.

368
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,886
Thank you, Sir.

369
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:08,679
Ready to fly.

370
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,489
We're ready to go, Sir.

371
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:12,735
All right.

372
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,589
Weapons to maximum.

373
00:24:17,906 --> 00:24:18,619
Sir?

374
00:24:18,949 --> 00:24:20,887
It's a joke, Marks.
Make it go.

375
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:57,797
Nothing I have done since
turning against the Goa'uld

376
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:01,182
will make up for the atrocities
I once committed in their name.

377
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,841
Somewhere deep inside you,
you knew it was wrong.

378
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,886
A voice you did not recognize
screamed for you to stop.

379
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:15,206
You saw no way out.

380
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:17,886
<i>It was the way things were.</i>

381
00:25:18,581 --> 00:25:20,364
<i>They could not be changed.</i>

382
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:24,887
<i>You tried to convince yourself that
the people you were hurting deserved it.</i>

383
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,271
<i>You became numb to their pain
and suffering.</i>

384
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:31,701
<i>You learned to shut out the voice
speaking against it.</i>

385
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:35,719
There's always a choice.

386
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,094
- Indeed, there he is.
<i>- I chose to ignore it.</i>

387
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:39,758
Yet you sit here now.

388
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:43,854
I sit here,

389
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:48,055
and I cannot imagine the day
when I will forgive myself.

390
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:49,994
Because it will never come.

391
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:55,033
One day, others may try to convince you
they have forgiven you.

392
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:57,959
That is more about them than you.

393
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:01,928
For them, imparting forgiveness
is a blessing.

394
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:05,266
How do you go on?

395
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:07,313
It is simple.

396
00:26:07,723 --> 00:26:09,866
You will never forgive yourself.

397
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,448
Accept it.

398
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:13,798
You hurt others.

399
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:15,975
Many others.

400
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:17,987
That cannot be undone.

401
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:21,774
You will never find
personal retribution.

402
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:25,519
<i>But your life does not have to end.</i>

403
00:26:25,683 --> 00:26:28,844
That which is right, just and true
can still prevail.

404
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:35,279
If you do not fight for what you believe
then all may be lost for everyone else.

405
00:26:36,668 --> 00:26:38,552
<i>But do not fight for yourself.</i>

406
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,017
Fight for others.

407
00:26:41,712 --> 00:26:44,749
Others that may be saved
through your effort.

408
00:26:47,236 --> 00:26:49,261
That is the least you can do.

409
00:27:15,193 --> 00:27:17,004
Okay, I think we're ready.

410
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:18,540
Dial it up.

411
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:50,189
Looks like we have a stable connection.

412
00:27:52,855 --> 00:27:53,556
What?

413
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,749
Based on the intel Daniel provided
when he was a Prior,

414
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:01,600
- I was pretty sure this was gonna work.
- Yeah, I didn't doubt that. It's just

415
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:05,752
now that we're actually here,
it's kinda cool.

416
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:11,029
Take her in.

417
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:28,252
You see that?

418
00:29:28,372 --> 00:29:29,137
What?

419
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:37,051
That old man?
What about him?

420
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:40,618
Nothing.

421
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:43,782
Glad we had this chat.

422
00:29:46,723 --> 00:29:49,208
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

423
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:52,500
In fact I get the feeling
we're on the right track.

424
00:29:58,855 --> 00:29:59,873
This is Hermes.

425
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:02,471
Hermes, this is Daniel.

426
00:30:03,257 --> 00:30:04,483
Vala, my wife.

427
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:07,574
We are still married.

428
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:10,135
We'll talk about that later.

429
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,319
<i>Tomin tells me you've not heard</i>

430
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,635
the rumor that the fires of Celestis
have gone out.

431
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,336
Really?

432
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:21,064
I assume Tomin also explained
that we're not from around here.

433
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:22,326
That, he did.

434
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:26,038
Still, I'm surprised such news
wouldn't have spread far and wide.

435
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,552
You would think.

436
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:31,583
But perhaps Tomin didn't explain
exactly how far away we live.

437
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:34,901
The Priors have seen this as a sign
that the Ori are not pleased.

438
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:38,806
They say our efforts against
the crusade of evil are not enough,

439
00:30:39,196 --> 00:30:40,359
that we must do more.

440
00:30:40,504 --> 00:30:42,702
As I told you,
many more ships have been built.

441
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:44,573
They are ready to embark.

442
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:48,869
Tomin also tells me you seek
the true location of Ortus Mallum.

443
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:49,960
We do.

444
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,909
<i>I'm curious.</i>

445
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:55,154
What makes you think such a place
actually exists in the real world?

446
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:58,652
You {\do not}don't believe all that is written in
the Book of Origin to be based in some

447
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:00,267
true historical event?

448
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,350
What I believe is not the issue.

449
00:31:02,522 --> 00:31:04,583
Do you want me to tell you
what I believe?

450
00:31:04,703 --> 00:31:05,406
<i>No.</i>

451
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:08,327
I want you to prove it.

452
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:11,665
Well, that we can do.

453
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:26,380
There are ruins of a village

454
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,782
high in the mountains
that border the plains of Celestis.

455
00:31:29,982 --> 00:31:33,009
<i>That is believed to be the location the
Book of Origin references as the birth</i>

456
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:35,639
- place of Evil.
<i>- Well, that makes sense.</i>

457
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,400
The Ori followers built
their holy city on the planet

458
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,461
where they believed their gods
once triumphed over the Alterans.

459
00:31:41,581 --> 00:31:43,806
Celestis isn't on this planet though.

460
00:31:43,938 --> 00:31:45,511
<i>You got us here.</i>

461
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:48,430
If we show you our map, could you direct
us to the coordinates of the planet

462
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,126
where Celestis is?

463
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:55,189
We're talking about the Vatican
of the Ori followers, right?

464
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,498
<i>Well, if the fires are out,</i>

465
00:31:57,681 --> 00:32:00,289
then it's likely Merlin's device
worked, and the Ori are dead.

466
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:01,730
But the Priors are not.

467
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,463
{\Well, w}We didn't come all this way
to stop now, did we?

468
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:08,679
<i>Many times throughout history, the ruins
of Ortus Mallum have been searched</i>

469
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:10,139
by both the Priors of Ori,

470
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:12,133
and those that believe as we do.

471
00:32:12,818 --> 00:32:15,917
We have long searched for the artefacts
that{\ wi}'ll prove the truth about our past,

472
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:19,570
our ancestors, and the falsehood
of the Book of Origin.

473
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:22,504
<i>Nothing has ever been found there.</i>

474
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,875
<i>That's good.</i>

475
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:28,100
Let's hope that means
what we're looking for is still there.

476
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,898
Why was I not notified
that you had someone on board

477
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:42,117
with new intel about Ori army activity?

478
00:32:42,281 --> 00:32:45,332
Well, I'm sure I called for you,
there was no answer. Oh, wait.

479
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:47,909
I may have not pressed the com button
all the way down.

480
00:32:48,055 --> 00:32:50,222
<i>I must've looked stupid
standing there talking to myself.</i>

481
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,888
- Anyway, if you'll excuse us...
- Colonel.

482
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,614
I'm sure I don't need to remind you
about protocol.

483
00:32:57,544 --> 00:32:59,555
We are all going to find the Ark,

484
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:02,200
Mr Merek, it's just too late
for you not to join us.

485
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:04,101
You were granted the use of this ship,

486
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:06,882
the most valuable asset
Earth currently has at its disposal,

487
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:10,147
to prevent any further Ori ships
from getting through the Supergate.

488
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:12,771
- And that's what we're gonna do.
- Do you

489
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:15,781
or do you not have reliable intelligence
that more

490
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:17,768
Ori ships are about to leave?

491
00:33:18,836 --> 00:33:20,500
Stay out of my way.

492
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:27,881
- Your instructions were clear, Colonel.
- We're not there yet. Major Marks!

493
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:31,008
New coordinates have been entered
to the nav system. Take us there.

494
00:33:31,128 --> 00:33:32,101
Yes, Sir.

495
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:34,310
You have no idea
how much time we have.

496
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,041
I'm not gonna sacrifice
this mission,

497
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,134
Earth, or our galaxy
for some fool's quest.

498
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,090
Then replace me!

499
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,707
<i>You have the authority.</i>

500
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:46,761
Go ahead.

501
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:49,011
Replace me.

502
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:05,769
You sure you don't want the chair?

503
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:06,641
No.

504
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:08,260
It's all yours.

505
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:13,905
Got your back though.

506
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:14,989
Thanks.

507
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:46,512
Any idea where to start?

508
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:48,580
Not really.

509
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:13,714
You okay?

510
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,948
I was thinking about
what this place really was.

511
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:25,479
<i>Colonel Mitchell,
this is Major Marks, come in.</i>

512
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,106
We read you, Marks, go ahead.

513
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,842
<i>Sir, someone
has turned on the Asgard core.</i>

514
00:36:29,962 --> 00:36:30,784
What?

515
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:31,680
Who?

516
00:36:31,863 --> 00:36:33,381
Do you really need to ask?

517
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:36,416
According to the security access card
that was used,

518
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:37,780
it's Mr Merek.

519
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,752
<i>The room is sealed
and he's not responding on the com.</i>

520
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:43,486
It can't be shut down remotely.
What the hell does he think he's doing?

521
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:45,471
I don't know, but we better find out.

522
00:36:45,591 --> 00:36:48,234
Jackson! Teal'c!
We gotta go, keep looking.

523
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:50,437
- What's wrong?
- Merek's up to something.

524
00:36:50,557 --> 00:36:52,466
He's turned on the Asgard core.

525
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,912
That will alert the Ori ships
to our presence.

526
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:58,617
Yeah, I think that's the idea.
We got it, you guys...

527
00:36:59,422 --> 00:37:00,647
find the Ark.

528
00:37:01,168 --> 00:37:02,010
<i>Marks.</i>

529
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:05,284
<i>Transport Colonel Carter and myself
back up to the ship now.</i>

530
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:19,576
It's SG-3, Sir.
Transmitting from P6X-437.

531
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:20,684
On screen.

532
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,017
<i>General.</i>

533
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:28,302
<i>A Prior arrived thru the Gate 15 minutes
ago and immediately made contact.</i>

534
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:31,914
<i>Not sure how,
but he seemed to know we were here.</i>

535
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:34,805
<i>He says he has no intention of harming
us, just he has a message to deliver</i>

536
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:37,495
<i>- to the leaders of our planet.</i>
- What is it?

537
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:39,396
<i>Wouldn't get into it, Sir.</i>

538
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:41,600
<i>Says he'll only deliver it personally.</i>

539
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,662
He wants us to let him
through the Gate?

540
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:44,555
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

541
00:37:44,747 --> 00:37:48,094
Does he know this didn't exactly
work out well the last time?

542
00:37:48,377 --> 00:37:50,553
<i>More for the Prior
in question than us, Sir.</i>

543
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:51,467
True.

544
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:55,851
<i>He's pretty adamant.</i>

545
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,567
<i>Says the message is key
to human survival on Earth.</i>

546
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:02,079
<i>He says he knows
that we have a technology</i>

547
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:04,174
<i>that can temporary
neutralize his powers.</i>

548
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,484
- He does, does he?
- <i>Yes, Sir.</i>

549
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:10,481
<i>Apparently, word that SG-1 actually
killed a Prior is getting around.</i>

550
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,878
Give us an hour to make
the necessary preparations.

551
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:16,064
<i>Yes, Sir.
Reynolds out.</i>

552
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:25,562
Open the door, Mr Merek.

553
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:28,658
Do you really think
we can't bypass the security lock?

554
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:31,457
<i>Answer me, Merek.</i>

555
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:38,471
<i>You have put this ship and everyone
on board in serious danger.</i>

556
00:38:39,138 --> 00:38:41,936
<i>Look, you know
that activating the Asgard core</i>

557
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:44,782
<i>will alert
any Ori vessel to our presence.</i>

558
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:49,139
I assume that's your plan,
force me to take action against them.

559
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:51,627
- Carter?
- Almost.

560
00:39:02,127 --> 00:39:03,773
It won't shut down.

561
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:05,835
No.

562
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,027
It's creating something virtually.
What is it?

563
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:10,661
You'll see.
I believe it's almost done.

564
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:12,808
What the hell are you thinking?

565
00:39:12,928 --> 00:39:15,320
Unlike you, doing the job
that I was sent to do.

566
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,864
Stop any further Ori invasion
at all cost.

567
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:21,390
Well, how does getting us killed
and this ship destroyed accomplish that?

568
00:39:21,561 --> 00:39:23,428
I assure you
that's not the plan, Colonel.

569
00:39:23,548 --> 00:39:27,029
Oh, really? Because we're about to be
surrounded by a bunch of Ori ships.

570
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:28,615
So I figure we got 2 options.

571
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:32,011
<i>We can shut that thing down
and hope to outrun them,</i>

572
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,068
or we can stay and fight
and lose badly.

573
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:36,628
And that's where you're wrong.

574
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:39,976
There are always other options.
You're just failing to consider them.

575
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:58,769
I hate to be the downer
at this party, but this is hopeless.

576
00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:00,514
I'm not getting any energy readings,

577
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:03,600
so, short of literally looking under
every rock and stone on this mountain,

578
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,155
I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.

579
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:32,600
Or we could wait for Daniel
to have another one of his visions.

580
00:40:41,115 --> 00:40:43,341
Guys, I think there's something here.

581
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:16,110
I think
we're supposed to go down there.

582
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,632
<i>This is Colonel Carter, we need
an ARG in the Asgard core room now.</i>

583
00:41:25,752 --> 00:41:27,880
Don't worry, {\Colonel,} it's being contained
by a force shield.

584
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:31,278
For now. If you knew anything
about these things, you'd know

585
00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:34,157
- nothing will hold it for long.
- Do you have any idea

586
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:36,758
what it finally took
to eradicate these little buggers?

587
00:41:36,878 --> 00:41:40,310
Exactly why it will be so effective
in neutralizing the Ori fleet.

588
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:42,432
That's your plan?

589
00:41:43,384 --> 00:41:45,039
What are you? Totally nuts?

590
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,469
Not my plan.

591
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,278
It's the IOA's.

592
00:41:49,756 --> 00:41:53,071
In the event that the Supergate
on this side was impossible to destroy,

593
00:41:53,191 --> 00:41:55,036
a backup plan was devised.

594
00:41:55,407 --> 00:41:58,953
<i>We knew we could draw the Ori
to the Odyssey by turning on the core.</i>

595
00:41:59,468 --> 00:42:01,755
<i>Yes, we might lose an all out battle</i>

596
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:04,737
with a large number of them but we'd
certainly be able to hang in long enough

597
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:07,388
to get this Replicator
on board of one of their ships.

598
00:42:07,562 --> 00:42:08,896
<i>At which point,</i>

599
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:11,745
<i>hopefully, we'd be able to escape.</i>

600
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:13,852
And since you

601
00:42:14,205 --> 00:42:16,529
were unwilling to even try
to destroy the Gate,

602
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,160
you left me no choice.

603
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:21,038
We came here to find the Ark.

604
00:42:22,616 --> 00:42:24,519
Nobody expected you to find it.

605
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,429
Excuse me?

606
00:42:26,948 --> 00:42:28,994
The Ori ships are preparing to leave.

607
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:31,549
<i>For all we know,
they're already gone.</i>

608
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:33,953
Obviously, you didn't come up
with this on your own.

609
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:35,279
Who wrote this program?

610
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,835
Does it really matter?

611
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:41,207
Thank you.

612
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:44,730
The ARG won't penetrate the shield.

613
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,661
When I shut it down, don't hesitate.

614
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:48,243
- <i>And don't miss!</i>
- I won't.

615
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,280
Zats have no effect on them.

616
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:04,757
Neither did this thing.

617
00:43:04,888 --> 00:43:06,864
You need P-90s.
Don't let it get away!

618
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,175
This way.

619
00:43:08,592 --> 00:43:10,502
Why the hell didn't it work?

620
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:14,134
I believe that particular susceptibility
was programmed out of this version.

621
00:43:14,254 --> 00:43:16,887
You slick son of a mental,
why didn't you tell us?

622
00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:18,982
You obviously had no intention
of allowing me

623
00:43:19,105 --> 00:43:21,450
- to follow through with the plan.
- If we can't stop it,

624
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,125
it will cannibalize
this ship and start replicating.

625
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:25,542
I should hope so.

626
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:29,472
And thanks to you it's now the only
way we have of infecting the Ori fleet.

627
00:43:29,596 --> 00:43:31,632
And what the hell is the IOA gonna do

628
00:43:31,752 --> 00:43:35,119
when the Replicators finish with the Ori
fleet and {\they }decide to take a little trip

629
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:36,557
<i>back through the Supergate?</i>

630
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,520
Precautions to prevent that scenario
have been put in place.

631
00:43:40,547 --> 00:43:41,667
Self destruct.

632
00:43:42,812 --> 00:43:45,884
You built in some sort of shutdown
command into the programming.

633
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:47,079
<i>I told you.</i>

634
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:48,333
It wasn't me.

635
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:00,974
{\Sir, }12 teams of 2 have been armed
and are searching top to bottom.

636
00:44:01,094 --> 00:44:02,614
These things are crafty, Captain.

637
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:05,263
They'll avoid any area of the ship
exposed to internal sensors.

638
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:07,718
They're small enough to use
the ventilation shafts or

639
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:10,574
to move through hollow walls and it's
only a matter of time before we could

640
00:44:10,705 --> 00:44:13,128
- be dealing with more than one.
- We'll find it, Sir.

641
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:15,672
Carter, talk to me.

642
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:18,763
The Asgard core was designed
to be very user friendly.

643
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:20,475
Whoever wrote this program didn't have

644
00:44:20,595 --> 00:44:22,730
to have an extensive knowledge
of Replicator technology.

645
00:44:22,853 --> 00:44:25,890
They only had to explain what they
wanted{\to create and}, the core filled in the blanks.

646
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,195
- And?
- Unfortunately, that means

647
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:30,675
the complete program
exists only in the core database.

648
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:32,531
Which means
{\that }you have to leave the core on

649
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:34,154
{\if you're gonna}to find the self destruct command.

650
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:35,471
If it even exists.

651
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:36,690
How long?

652
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,555
I don't know. I'm trying to narrow down
the search parameters but it's huge.

653
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:42,284
{\Alright, look,}Just forget about the fact that
we're standing here screaming and waving

654
00:44:42,404 --> 00:44:45,757
our hands at the Ori. They probably
already know our position anyway.

655
00:44:45,877 --> 00:44:49,203
{\Alright,}Let's jump into hyperspace. At least the
Ori ships won't be able to attack us.

656
00:44:49,323 --> 00:44:52,240
Yeah but they can track us in hyperspace
and we can't stay there forever.

657
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,159
Believe me,
if we don't find that Replicator

658
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,400
or the self destruct command,
"forever": not going to be a big issue.

659
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:31,390
<i>Hey guys, it's Mitchell, we're about
to beam you onboard immediately.</i>

660
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,550
Wait, you can't, not yet.

661
00:45:33,768 --> 00:45:36,768
<i>Yeah, well,
Merek activated the Asgard core.</i>

662
00:45:36,888 --> 00:45:39,988
<i>So we're expecting Ori ships
around here sometime soon.</i>

663
00:45:40,558 --> 00:45:42,872
<i>Plus, we have
a little Replicator problem.</i>

664
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:45,243
<i>So we're going to jump into hyperspace
to avoid the bad guys</i>

665
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:46,724
<i>while we deal with it.</i>

666
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,134
I'm sorry, did you say
"Replicator problem"?

667
00:45:50,037 --> 00:45:51,825
<i>Unfortunately, yes, I did.</i>

668
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:58,779
Major Marks, transport the team
on the planet back up to the ship.

669
00:45:58,899 --> 00:46:01,678
As soon as they are safely onboard,
take us into hyperspace.

670
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,059
Sir, I'm attempting to transport
the team on the surface

671
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,039
but the system is not responding.

672
00:46:07,961 --> 00:46:10,283
I've lost control
of the ship's computer.

673
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:14,068
- It's plugged itself in somewhere.
- That was fast.

674
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,579
{\Well, i}It doesn't have much learning to do.
Everything about the Odyssey

675
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:19,577
and its systems has been preprogrammed
into the Replicator's memory.

676
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,729
I'm attempting to isolate life support,
navigation and hyperdrive command

677
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,597
and restrict it to the Asgard core.

678
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:27,103
Hopefully I can maintain
some measure of control from here.

679
00:46:27,227 --> 00:46:29,602
Right, I'm going to help
find the damn thing.

680
00:46:34,685 --> 00:46:36,062
What's a Replicator?

681
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:37,555
You do not wish to know.

682
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:40,867
<i>Yeah, it's me again.</i>

683
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,590
<i>Your friendly neighborhood
ship's commander.</i>

684
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,799
<i>Looks like you got
a little more time down there.</i>

685
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,638
<i>We're having a bit of trouble
with the beaming thing at the moment.</i>

686
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,807
<i>I promise you'll be the first to know...</i>

687
00:46:58,755 --> 00:46:59,792
Okay, so?

688
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,145
Onwards.

689
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,469
What do you think, Muscles?

690
00:47:30,668 --> 00:47:34,101
Wait wait wait, we can't.
We don't know how stable this tunnel is.

691
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:36,957
So we turn back then, Daniel Jackson?

692
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:42,605
Bombs away.

693
00:47:52,212 --> 00:47:54,999
<i>Sir, we have lost
the external communications array,</i>

694
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:58,527
<i>we are experiencing power fluctuations
throughout the power grid.</i>

695
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,345
Yeah, I got that.

696
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:04,603
Daniel Jackson.

697
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:24,128
This is it.

698
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:27,114
Oh, you're sure this time?

699
00:49:27,238 --> 00:49:28,238
Definitely.

700
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:30,301
We found it.

701
00:49:56,401 --> 00:50:00,173
You demonstrate great courage
facing me in person,

702
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:01,783
General.

703
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:05,478
Courage is only required
when facing that what you fear.

704
00:50:07,545 --> 00:50:11,093
The flames of ignorance
burn without pain.

705
00:50:11,722 --> 00:50:13,240
Beware the power,

706
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:16,187
or it will consume you
before you know.

707
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:18,702
You can skip the fire and brimstone.

708
00:50:19,386 --> 00:50:22,505
If you're here to tell me
that you're finally coming after Earth,

709
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:24,070
I already know.

710
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,813
It is not too late.

711
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:31,196
Allow me to deliver
the message to your world

712
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:34,033
that Origin is the way to salvation

713
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:36,627
and you will all be spared.

714
00:50:37,396 --> 00:50:40,576
I have to tell you,
even if I did let you have your say,

715
00:50:40,893 --> 00:50:43,113
I don't think my world is gonna listen.

716
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,144
Then you are all doomed.

717
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:50,263
That may be so.

718
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,559
But I don't think
it's you that's gonna do it.

719
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:57,429
I would not be so sure.

720
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:58,938
Really?

721
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,831
What took you so long?

722
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:04,137
Earth has to be the most
densily populated planet in the galaxy.

723
00:51:04,257 --> 00:51:05,977
What are you waiting for?

724
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:07,824
Sure you've tried to...

725
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,857
warn us a couple of times, but come on,
you can do better than that, can't you?

726
00:51:12,225 --> 00:51:13,559
We've been a tremendous

727
00:51:13,723 --> 00:51:16,006
pain in your proverbial backside.

728
00:51:17,765 --> 00:51:20,053
You don't really expect me
to believe that you...

729
00:51:20,173 --> 00:51:22,929
you've just been saving
the best for last, do you?

730
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:28,033
What's wrong?
You guys are never speechless.

731
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,273
I'll tell you what I think.

732
00:51:34,514 --> 00:51:36,168
I say this move

733
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,434
reeks of desperation.

734
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,654
You're not all that sure to slam-dunk.

735
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:46,003
Your defences are no match
for the might of the Ori

736
00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:48,702
which shall rain down Apocalypse upon...

737
00:51:48,822 --> 00:51:51,425
Right, right, here's a news flash.

738
00:51:52,557 --> 00:51:54,147
The Ori are dead.

739
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:56,310
We killed them.

740
00:51:57,441 --> 00:52:00,201
Sent a weapon devised by a ex-Ancient
through the Supergate,

741
00:52:00,321 --> 00:52:01,803
and wiped them all out.

742
00:52:02,401 --> 00:52:04,533
These beings you call gods,

743
00:52:04,853 --> 00:52:06,454
the ones who lied to you,

744
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:08,769
manipulated you,

745
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:11,839
for their own selfish
power-hungry reasons

746
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:13,199
are gone.

747
00:52:14,734 --> 00:52:17,473
And everything you think
you're doing in their name

748
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:19,337
is entirely without meaning.

749
00:52:21,357 --> 00:52:22,512
I was wrong.

750
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:25,807
You are not courageous, General.

751
00:52:26,471 --> 00:52:28,901
You are without reason.

752
00:52:29,442 --> 00:52:33,380
Your planet will burn
in all the depths of darkness.

753
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:35,207
We'll see about that.

754
00:52:36,002 --> 00:52:38,362
There is one thing I do know for sure.

755
00:52:39,794 --> 00:52:41,432
If we're going to hell,

756
00:52:42,378 --> 00:52:43,757
then you're coming with us.

757
00:52:47,217 --> 00:52:49,818
You go ahead and burst
into flames if you like.

758
00:53:05,703 --> 00:53:07,315
<i>Sir, we think we've traced the problem</i>

759
00:53:07,447 --> 00:53:09,869
<i>to the rear auxiliary
control room in your level.</i>

760
00:53:10,782 --> 00:53:11,896
Copy that.

761
00:53:30,556 --> 00:53:34,053
All personnel, this is Colonel Mitchell.
Please report, I got it.

762
00:53:37,478 --> 00:53:39,087
Oh, shit!

763
00:53:49,445 --> 00:53:53,269
{\Hey, Sam, t}They seem to be living up to their name.
There's {\definitely }more than one at this point.

764
00:53:53,389 --> 00:53:55,044
- How many?
- A lot.

765
00:53:58,628 --> 00:54:01,237
<i>The original has probably
converted into a queen by now.</i>

766
00:54:01,444 --> 00:54:04,576
The good news is {\that }it's likely stationary.
Other Replicators will bring it

767
00:54:04,696 --> 00:54:06,756
raw material {\that }
it will then use to create new blocks.

768
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,336
That's what you're looking for
at this point.

769
00:54:09,841 --> 00:54:10,645
Cam?

770
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:12,848
Cam!

771
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:29,291
Daniel, for goodness sake,
stop fussing,

772
00:54:29,411 --> 00:54:31,271
- and just open it!
- Wait, wait, wait!

773
00:54:42,209 --> 00:54:44,051
What was supposed to happen?

774
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,200
Nothing.

775
00:54:46,677 --> 00:54:48,731
I don't think it's turned on.

776
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:50,257
Maybe it's broken.

777
00:54:50,681 --> 00:54:52,605
Perhaps its power source
has been depleted.

778
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:55,559
- {\Well, i}It is millions of years old.
- I don't think it's turned on.

779
00:54:55,871 --> 00:54:57,640
Well, turn it on then.

780
00:54:58,182 --> 00:54:59,167
I think...

781
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:02,203
it has something to do with

782
00:55:02,408 --> 00:55:03,524
these symbols.

783
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,670
They look like buttons.

784
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,163
Perhaps we should examine
more closely on the surface.

785
00:55:16,283 --> 00:55:17,437
Good idea.

786
00:55:19,924 --> 00:55:20,727
Cam!

787
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:25,488
Cam, are you there? Please respond.

788
00:55:34,514 --> 00:55:37,622
Sorry about that Sam,
I ran out of ammo and had to hide.

789
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,076
Copy.

790
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:56,293
Colonel?
Four Ori mother ships on sensors.

791
00:55:57,022 --> 00:55:58,627
They're moving to surround us.

792
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:01,078
Got it. Jumping to hyperspace.

793
00:56:15,424 --> 00:56:17,395
Odyssey, this is Teal'c. Come in.

794
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:23,876
Odyssey, this is Teal'c. Come in.

795
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:25,519
Teal'c!

796
00:57:08,953 --> 00:57:11,395
I assume you haven't found
the magic shut off switch?

797
00:57:11,544 --> 00:57:14,560
No. The Replicators are going to come
after the core sooner or later.

798
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,226
I don't know why they haven't yet.

799
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:19,011
- Consolidating their numbers?
- Whatever they're trying to do,

800
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:21,654
eventually, they're going to want
to take total control of this ship.

801
00:57:21,774 --> 00:57:23,913
{\And i}In order to do that,
they{\'re gonna}'ll have to get into this room.

802
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:25,829
We should stop them from doing that.

803
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:28,093
I got people trapped all over the place.

804
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:30,908
Replicators have blocked down most
of the elevators and bulkheads.

805
00:57:31,056 --> 00:57:32,617
{\They're t}Trying to restrict the crew movement.

806
00:57:32,804 --> 00:57:34,807
They've also shutdown systems
all over the ship.

807
00:57:34,946 --> 00:57:37,111
It takes a lot of power to replicate.

808
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:40,275
My guess is the queen has set up shop
somewhere close to a main conduit.

809
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,239
Position all the personnel you have
right here, protect that room

810
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:47,002
- at all cost.
- We should probably weld the door shut.

811
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:49,450
- You won't be able to get out.
- If the Replicators make it

812
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:53,561
- into the core, it's not {\going to}gonna matter.
- Do it. I'm going to go find the queen.

813
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:54,475
<i>How?</i>

814
00:57:54,595 --> 00:57:57,976
Like grandma said,
you want honey, follow the bees.

815
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,562
Sounds like a good way
of getting stung to me.

816
00:58:25,516 --> 00:58:26,279
Hey!

817
00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:27,452
Hello?

818
00:58:28,892 --> 00:58:30,366
Let me out of here.

819
00:58:32,121 --> 00:58:33,144
Anybody?

820
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,126
Help!

821
00:59:27,548 --> 00:59:28,819
Daniel Jackson?

822
00:59:32,005 --> 00:59:33,475
Vala Mal Doran?

823
00:59:39,269 --> 00:59:42,319
Odyssey... This is Teal'c.
Do you read me?

824
00:59:44,977 --> 00:59:47,345
Odyssey, this is Teal'c.
Can you hear me?

825
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:23,159
God!

826
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:26,937
Your gods cannot save you now,
Daniel Jackson.

827
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:29,448
Well... That's just a statement

828
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:31,695
of general dissatisfaction.

829
01:02:58,296 --> 01:02:59,644
Please, mercy.

830
01:04:13,423 --> 01:04:14,666
They're comin'.

831
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,759
Carter, I found it.

832
01:05:29,276 --> 01:05:32,136
<i>It's in an access tube
off cargo hold three.</i>

833
01:05:32,256 --> 01:05:34,079
That's good.
Now get the hell out of there.

834
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:36,519
- <i>You don't want me to blow it up?</i>
- Not yet.

835
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,600
<i>Sam,</i>

836
01:05:42,879 --> 01:05:45,284
it's making more of
those little buggers right now.

837
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:49,606
<i>Destroying the Queen will likely draw
any other Replicators{\ on board} directly to you.</i>

838
01:05:49,767 --> 01:05:52,093
<i>Not a good plan until
we have the shutdown code.</i>

839
01:05:52,925 --> 01:05:53,799
Right.

840
01:05:53,961 --> 01:05:56,035
Besides, they're not coming
after the core just yet.

841
01:05:56,155 --> 01:05:58,679
When they do, we may need
the distraction to draw them away.

842
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,051
Copy that.

843
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:25,638
This program is huge.
That could take weeks to go through.

844
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:27,553
- Skim.
- What if I miss it?

845
01:06:27,673 --> 01:06:30,236
It's a base directive. It's like the one
that tells them to replicate.

846
01:06:30,356 --> 01:06:32,609
Only this one,
when transmitted on a certain frequency,

847
01:06:32,729 --> 01:06:34,769
will command them to disassemble.

848
01:06:34,889 --> 01:06:36,356
It should stand out.

849
01:06:46,405 --> 01:06:47,766
What the hell?

850
01:07:32,736 --> 01:07:34,283
So much for the rumors.

851
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:16,219
- Oh no!
- What?

852
01:08:16,365 --> 01:08:19,258
I asked the core to analyze the program
looking for the shutdown command.

853
01:08:19,378 --> 01:08:21,373
- It says there isn't one.
- Can we write one?

854
01:08:21,493 --> 01:08:22,775
Already started.

855
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:26,231
Good to see you, Mother.

856
01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:28,080
Or should I call you Vala?

857
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,186
I believe you renounced our
blood relation last time I saw you.

858
01:08:31,306 --> 01:08:33,513
Seems you have
no blood left to speak of.

859
01:08:33,671 --> 01:08:37,028
You'll be somewhat satisfied to know
that Merlin's weapon did work.

860
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,945
The Ori were destroyed.

861
01:08:39,314 --> 01:08:40,039
Really?

862
01:08:42,948 --> 01:08:45,630
Somehow,
you and your simple human friends

863
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:49,939
managed to destroy quite a large group
of very powerful ascended beings.

864
01:08:50,149 --> 01:08:52,025
Well, we're a very determined bunch.

865
01:08:52,145 --> 01:08:54,621
I always say you never know
what you can do until you try.

866
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:55,999
I agree.

867
01:08:57,121 --> 01:08:59,199
You don't seem too cut up about it.

868
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:00,992
No.

869
01:09:03,018 --> 01:09:05,317
The energy transferred to
the Ori by their human followers

870
01:09:05,481 --> 01:09:07,558
used to be spread out among many.

871
01:09:08,146 --> 01:09:09,838
<i>Now that I have ascended,</i>

872
01:09:10,155 --> 01:09:11,384
I get it all.

873
01:09:12,005 --> 01:09:13,879
If you don't kill us all first.

874
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:17,073
It's a shame I can't use
your little discovery

875
01:09:17,218 --> 01:09:19,795
to convince everyone
in your galaxy to follow me.

876
01:09:20,053 --> 01:09:21,691
It would be much more humane.

877
01:09:23,608 --> 01:09:25,326
Not as much fun, though.

878
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,674
Not wanting to give you any ideas
but why can't you use the Ark?

879
01:09:29,925 --> 01:09:31,445
It's just not the same.

880
01:09:31,617 --> 01:09:34,696
People need to be convinced
to see me for what I really am.

881
01:09:35,419 --> 01:09:37,296
A spoiled brat with a God complex.

882
01:09:37,533 --> 01:09:38,617
No, Mother.

883
01:09:39,066 --> 01:09:43,428
The Ark can only be programmed
to make people believe what is true.

884
01:09:44,684 --> 01:09:46,309
Once the Ancients have been destroyed,

885
01:09:46,429 --> 01:09:48,922
I will be a being
of unchallengeable power, worshipped

886
01:09:49,042 --> 01:09:50,439
by all those beneath me.

887
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:54,599
A true god by any definition,
wouldn't you say?

888
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,792
You know, I think we really...

889
01:10:43,307 --> 01:10:45,025
We got off on the wrong foot.

890
01:10:55,066 --> 01:10:56,506
Who am I kidding?

891
01:10:56,956 --> 01:10:59,269
I knew you were an asshole
the moment we met.

892
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:45,079
Colonel,
we're running out of ammo, here.

893
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,039
Cam, we could really use
that distraction now.

894
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:58,357
Roger that, Sam.
I'm working on it.

895
01:12:31,387 --> 01:12:34,239
We're being overrun.
You need to draw them away.

896
01:12:36,286 --> 01:12:38,128
I'm on it ASAP.

897
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,039
You're looking for this?

898
01:12:44,942 --> 01:12:46,052
Did I drop that?

899
01:12:46,911 --> 01:12:49,845
{\I don't suppose y}You'd mind flipping that switch
and blowing us both up, would you?

900
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:18,534
Why do you need to take on the Ancients?

901
01:14:19,033 --> 01:14:22,039
Seriously, how many human worshippers
do you really need?

902
01:14:22,201 --> 01:14:24,914
<i>Can't you just live with
what you have and be happy?</i>

903
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:27,927
I mean, my own mother
used to say to me: "Vala,

904
01:14:28,178 --> 01:14:30,742
happiness is not something you can buy."

905
01:14:32,248 --> 01:14:33,755
Or in my case, steal.

906
01:14:34,997 --> 01:14:37,589
- But I think the point is...
- They are a threat to me.

907
01:14:37,709 --> 01:14:40,075
From what I understand,
they don't even care about you.

908
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:42,543
They saw the Ori as a threat
and they did nothing about that.

909
01:14:42,675 --> 01:14:44,221
That's what you chose to believe.

910
01:14:44,406 --> 01:14:46,296
They gave you the means
to destroy the Ori.

911
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:48,253
They'll stop at nothing to destroy me.

912
01:14:48,531 --> 01:14:49,773
I will not rest

913
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:52,363
until they're all wiped from existence.

914
01:14:52,919 --> 01:14:55,482
I wish you hadn't inherited
my determination.

915
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:19,369
Sir, long range sensors just picked up
seven Ori mother ships

916
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:21,591
exiting hyperspace
in our solar system.

917
01:15:21,802 --> 01:15:23,480
I've Colonel Ellis for you.

918
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:27,319
<i>General, we have visual
of enemy contacts.</i>

919
01:15:27,604 --> 01:15:29,759
<i>They appear to be holding position, Sir.</i>

920
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:31,740
- For the moment.
- <i>Yes, Sir.</i>

921
01:15:31,952 --> 01:15:33,395
<i>Why do you think that is, Sir?</i>

922
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:36,346
<i>The weapons platform
in Antartica is incapable</i>

923
01:15:36,466 --> 01:15:39,155
<i>of defending the planet
against seven Ori ships.</i>

924
01:15:39,697 --> 01:15:41,123
So why are they waiting?

925
01:15:41,243 --> 01:15:42,340
Yes, Sir.

926
01:15:42,869 --> 01:15:45,919
I don't know. Just be glad
they're giving us a little more time.

927
01:15:47,196 --> 01:15:49,164
<i>Sir, given how seriously
outgunned we are,</i>

928
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:51,676
<i>I don't see how a little
more time really helps</i>

929
01:15:51,874 --> 01:15:53,879
<i>or what could possibly
save us at this point.</i>

930
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:56,076
I was hoping...

931
01:15:56,196 --> 01:15:58,442
SG-1 might show up at some point.

932
01:15:58,759 --> 01:16:00,450
- <i>Yes, Sir.</i>
- I tell you this much,

933
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:02,803
<i>we're not going down without a fight.</i>

934
01:16:03,001 --> 01:16:04,191
<i>Landry out.</i>

935
01:16:14,389 --> 01:16:15,919
We just dropped out of hyperspace.

936
01:16:16,081 --> 01:16:18,669
That's funny, I was just thinking
we couldn't get anymore screwed.

937
01:16:18,841 --> 01:16:21,519
The Replicators took back
navigation and hyperdrive control.

938
01:16:22,965 --> 01:16:25,252
Four Ori mother ships
just appeared on sensors!

939
01:17:22,363 --> 01:17:23,301
Kill me!

940
01:17:23,843 --> 01:17:25,481
Believe me, I'm trying.

941
01:17:25,601 --> 01:17:28,191
They did this to get
the self-destruct code.

942
01:17:29,988 --> 01:17:30,966
What is it?

943
01:17:31,161 --> 01:17:32,116
Tell me!

944
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:34,006
I don't know.

945
01:17:34,931 --> 01:17:36,959
It's on the other side of the crystal.

946
01:17:58,857 --> 01:18:00,072
<i>It's not over.</i>

947
01:18:01,528 --> 01:18:02,744
<i>Don't give up.</i>

948
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:06,303
You're not Merlin.

949
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:07,928
<i>I'm here to help you.</i>

950
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,109
Then help me.

951
01:18:14,046 --> 01:18:15,631
You must find the strength.

952
01:18:28,712 --> 01:18:29,650
Nope.

953
01:18:32,602 --> 01:18:33,315
No.

954
01:18:36,355 --> 01:18:37,822
No, I've had it.

955
01:18:38,456 --> 01:18:41,327
You know, I'm really not
in the mood for games right now.

956
01:18:43,732 --> 01:18:46,355
You're not a figment of my imagination
and you're not...

957
01:18:46,475 --> 01:18:47,538
Merlin.

958
01:18:49,626 --> 01:18:51,279
You're Morgan le Fey.

959
01:18:52,058 --> 01:18:53,299
You're delirious.

960
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:55,758
Merlin died.

961
01:18:56,828 --> 01:18:58,388
He didn't ascend.

962
01:18:58,613 --> 01:19:00,741
His consciousness left me and it's...

963
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:02,882
it's gone.

964
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,094
The Ancients must be able to see
through your disguise, I know I can.

965
01:19:08,226 --> 01:19:10,664
I just don't know
why you think it's necessary.

966
01:19:14,978 --> 01:19:17,999
You were once ascended.
You know how complicated it can be.

967
01:19:18,665 --> 01:19:20,780
Interfering with the lower planes
is not allowed.

968
01:19:21,349 --> 01:19:24,045
Yeah I know.
I did it myself more than once.

969
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:28,397
Helping me is forbidden and letting me
know you're helping me, well, that's...

970
01:19:28,517 --> 01:19:29,508
worse.

971
01:19:29,721 --> 01:19:31,769
I did it once and they stopped me.

972
01:19:32,139 --> 01:19:33,712
I was exiled for it.

973
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:39,319
Yet, here you are.

974
01:19:40,256 --> 01:19:42,683
Merlin saw the Ori for what they were.

975
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,518
He knew they needed to be stopped.

976
01:19:44,638 --> 01:19:47,519
I was the one who prevented him
from doing it the first time.

977
01:19:47,836 --> 01:19:49,356
You kept him alive.

978
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:52,279
You helped us find him.

979
01:19:52,441 --> 01:19:54,096
I realized he was right.

980
01:19:54,216 --> 01:19:56,909
<i>The Ori were going
to destroy the Ancients.</i>

981
01:19:57,606 --> 01:20:00,005
No matter they want to admit it or not,

982
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:01,319
we saved them.

983
01:20:03,121 --> 01:20:05,666
I think we deserve
the Ancients' help in return.

984
01:20:05,841 --> 01:20:07,057
So I believe.

985
01:20:09,143 --> 01:20:10,399
Then help us.

986
01:20:13,052 --> 01:20:14,541
I've done all I can.

987
01:20:15,345 --> 01:20:16,740
No, you can do more.

988
01:20:16,872 --> 01:20:19,314
You can do much more,
and you have to.

989
01:20:20,364 --> 01:20:21,633
Not on my own.

990
01:20:22,809 --> 01:20:24,519
She's too powerful for me.

991
01:20:25,703 --> 01:20:26,541
She...

992
01:20:31,725 --> 01:20:33,587
you mean Adria, don't you?

993
01:20:33,775 --> 01:20:36,109
She took on the mantle of the Ori.

994
01:20:37,776 --> 01:20:39,079
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

995
01:20:39,206 --> 01:20:42,891
- She has their galactic power.
- Then take it away from her.

996
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:46,239
And not just for our sake.

997
01:20:47,326 --> 01:20:48,782
I've distracted her,

998
01:20:49,298 --> 01:20:51,414
I've helped you when you needed me.

999
01:20:51,752 --> 01:20:54,663
<i>I promise you, Daniel,
I've done all I can.</i>

1000
01:20:56,144 --> 01:20:56,862
No.

1001
01:20:57,319 --> 01:21:00,119
<i>You need only use the Ark
on one Prior.</i>

1002
01:21:00,841 --> 01:21:02,953
The crystals in their staffs
are linked to one another.

1003
01:21:03,073 --> 01:21:05,347
It's how the Doci communicates
with all at once.

1004
01:21:05,467 --> 01:21:07,582
If you can turn just one of them,

1005
01:21:08,259 --> 01:21:10,662
<i>Adria's power will be
greatly diminished.</i>

1006
01:21:11,305 --> 01:21:12,033
How?

1007
01:21:14,681 --> 01:21:15,418
How?

1008
01:21:36,874 --> 01:21:38,905
Carter, I hope you can hear this.

1009
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:40,900
The self-destruct program

1010
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,153
is on the other side of the crystal.

1011
01:21:45,843 --> 01:21:48,559
<i>The program for the self-destruct</i>

1012
01:21:48,721 --> 01:21:50,853
<i>is on the other side of the crystal.</i>

1013
01:22:04,096 --> 01:22:05,179
Oh, hell.

1014
01:22:45,468 --> 01:22:46,365
Tomin.

1015
01:22:47,414 --> 01:22:48,802
Tomin, it's Vala.

1016
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,052
Now, come on.

1017
01:22:51,323 --> 01:22:52,186
Come on!

1018
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,431
Come here.

1019
01:22:57,607 --> 01:22:58,454
Listen.

1020
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:01,017
Everything's gonna be okay,
I promise.

1021
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:05,781
Can you pull yourself together?

1022
01:23:09,048 --> 01:23:09,826
Good.

1023
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:12,187
Now, I want you
to help me find Daniel.

1024
01:23:12,307 --> 01:23:13,445
I'm right here.

1025
01:23:16,441 --> 01:23:17,617
You guys okay?

1026
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,818
I don't feel very good.

1027
01:23:22,551 --> 01:23:24,194
Let's find the Ark.

1028
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,278
Come.

1029
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:12,603
Oh, give me a break.

1030
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:30,079
Shields are at 18%,
hyperdrive is still offline.

1031
01:25:31,561 --> 01:25:33,898
And then she just suddenly disappeared
somewhere as if she had

1032
01:25:34,026 --> 01:25:35,932
something really important to do.

1033
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:38,810
And when I turned around, about
seven symbols on the Ark were glowing.

1034
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:41,399
- It was Morgan.
- Is she helping, because

1035
01:25:41,561 --> 01:25:43,727
- if she is, I don't understand...
- Which seven symbols?

1036
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:45,338
{\Well, y}You don't expect me to remember?

1037
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:47,961
With the fate of 2 galaxies {\hanging }
in the balance, {\yes, }I expect you to remember

1038
01:25:48,092 --> 01:25:49,999
the {\essential }clue given to you
by {\a powerful}an ascended being.

1039
01:25:50,163 --> 01:25:52,863
The glow wasn't that long{\. It was}, more like
a bright light when I turned around,

1040
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:55,342
- I realised I was alone{\ and might }-- look for you.
- Which ones?

1041
01:25:56,241 --> 01:25:57,915
One here, two here,

1042
01:25:58,281 --> 01:25:59,861
two here, and two there.

1043
01:25:59,981 --> 01:26:01,934
- Does it come in any order?
- No, all at once.

1044
01:26:02,054 --> 01:26:04,288
- Of course.
- Someone's coming.

1045
01:26:06,429 --> 01:26:07,781
Okay, seven symbols.

1046
01:26:07,901 --> 01:26:09,194
Just make a guess.

1047
01:26:09,314 --> 01:26:11,768
- "Veramas" is truth in Ancient.
- Good.

1048
01:26:15,782 --> 01:26:16,730
Two there.

1049
01:26:22,882 --> 01:26:24,199
I guess not.

1050
01:26:57,742 --> 01:27:00,858
This is Colonel Mitchell of the Earth
ship Odyssey. We surrender.

1051
01:27:01,357 --> 01:27:03,044
Please cease fire.

1052
01:27:03,457 --> 01:27:05,248
Repeat, we surrender.

1053
01:27:08,355 --> 01:27:09,061
Sam?

1054
01:27:09,881 --> 01:27:11,593
I don't think they're gonna stop.

1055
01:27:11,713 --> 01:27:14,760
I have to get the hyperdrive back
in time. We can't take much more.

1056
01:27:25,968 --> 01:27:26,984
<i>It's over.</i>

1057
01:27:27,881 --> 01:27:29,050
You can't win.

1058
01:27:29,488 --> 01:27:30,831
There's only one path,

1059
01:27:32,174 --> 01:27:34,868
the power and glory of Origin.

1060
01:27:46,818 --> 01:27:47,674
Adria.

1061
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,083
I'm sorry.

1062
01:27:51,728 --> 01:27:54,345
- <i>{\I w}Wish things could have been different.</i>
- Me too.

1063
01:27:56,325 --> 01:27:58,169
<i>So, what are you gonna do?</i>

1064
01:27:59,255 --> 01:28:01,287
We're obviously never
going to agree.

1065
01:28:03,775 --> 01:28:05,597
Are you gonna kill me now?

1066
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:06,975
No! You can't take away my power.

1067
01:29:11,788 --> 01:29:13,785
I think we just did.

1068
01:29:15,713 --> 01:29:19,449
You will all burn
in the fires of eternal damnation.

1069
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,872
Not if I have anything to do with it.

1070
01:29:25,053 --> 01:29:26,319
You're no match for me.

1071
01:29:28,935 --> 01:29:30,002
I am now.

1072
01:30:03,281 --> 01:30:04,085
What?

1073
01:30:05,635 --> 01:30:07,546
What did he say?
I don't understand.

1074
01:30:08,647 --> 01:30:10,490
He said: "Have mercy,

1075
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,599
"I was blind, but now I see."

1076
01:30:28,065 --> 01:30:28,796
Sam!

1077
01:30:31,258 --> 01:30:32,618
Why did they stop?

1078
01:30:32,773 --> 01:30:33,927
<i>I don't know,</i>

1079
01:30:34,607 --> 01:30:36,389
but I'm glad they did.

1080
01:30:47,702 --> 01:30:49,079
It was "Origin".

1081
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,981
What was?

1082
01:30:53,202 --> 01:30:54,734
The keyword that activated the Ark.

1083
01:30:56,308 --> 01:30:58,839
I realized while Adria was talking,
{\the }in Ancient, {\version of }the word also means

1084
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:00,779
truth, in older dialects.

1085
01:31:01,725 --> 01:31:04,399
I guess the Alteran that built it
must have thought it was ironic.

1086
01:31:10,504 --> 01:31:12,799
You know, I'm starting to think
that irony is very overrated.

1087
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,764
Have you reconsidered?

1088
01:31:36,522 --> 01:31:37,228
No.

1089
01:31:44,937 --> 01:31:46,780
I do not understand.

1090
01:31:48,243 --> 01:31:49,245
Take it.

1091
01:31:56,875 --> 01:31:58,717
We have something to show you.

1092
01:32:07,148 --> 01:32:09,283
What is the meaning of this?

1093
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:10,833
See for yourself.

1094
01:32:27,882 --> 01:32:28,622
Hey.

1095
01:32:29,431 --> 01:32:30,154
Hey.

1096
01:32:31,945 --> 01:32:33,858
- How did it go?
- Worked like a charm.

1097
01:32:33,978 --> 01:32:36,027
Daniel was right.
The Priors' staffs still all seemed

1098
01:32:36,147 --> 01:32:37,359
to be connected somehow.

1099
01:32:37,521 --> 01:32:39,116
Were they in each galaxy?

1100
01:32:39,236 --> 01:32:43,523
Yeah, {\I mean, }whatever subspace link connects
them is obviously somewhat limited.

1101
01:32:44,241 --> 01:32:46,389
And {\still }when Daniel opened the Ark
for the Prior{\ that was here},

1102
01:32:46,509 --> 01:32:48,257
everyone seemed to get the message.

1103
01:32:48,377 --> 01:32:49,995
- The ships backed off.
- Yep.

1104
01:32:50,555 --> 01:32:51,863
Sorry I missed it.

1105
01:32:52,612 --> 01:32:54,006
How are you doing?

1106
01:32:54,436 --> 01:32:55,448
You know,

1107
01:32:56,087 --> 01:32:57,404
I've felt worse.

1108
01:32:58,471 --> 01:33:02,542
Well, apparently, when you're feeling
better, the IOA wants to meet with you.

1109
01:33:03,561 --> 01:33:04,285
Really?

1110
01:33:04,956 --> 01:33:06,725
Something about an apology.

1111
01:33:08,661 --> 01:33:10,530
I don't know. My recovery

1112
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:12,188
could take a while.

1113
01:33:12,308 --> 01:33:14,206
Yeah. Not too long I hope.

1114
01:33:14,352 --> 01:33:15,974
- No.
- Oh, sorry.

1115
01:33:16,103 --> 01:33:17,084
It's okay.

1116
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,834
I guess maybe that hurts a little.

1117
01:33:20,148 --> 01:33:21,017
I'll...

1118
01:33:21,809 --> 01:33:22,928
let you rest.

1119
01:33:27,318 --> 01:33:28,075
Sam.

1120
01:33:28,535 --> 01:33:29,309
Yeah.

1121
01:33:30,136 --> 01:33:31,486
What's in the bag?

1122
01:33:31,607 --> 01:33:33,398
My God. I almost forgot.

1123
01:33:34,973 --> 01:33:36,453
I baked these for you.

1124
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:47,719
Macaroons.

1125
01:33:47,881 --> 01:33:50,496
I'm sure they're not as good
as your grandma's.

1126
01:33:50,668 --> 01:33:51,804
Nice recall.

1127
01:33:56,048 --> 01:33:57,072
Cheek okay?

1128
01:33:58,794 --> 01:33:59,569
Yeah.

1129
01:34:22,341 --> 01:34:24,424
You're going to make a great leader.

1130
01:34:27,893 --> 01:34:30,217
When I was being tortured
by the Prior,

1131
01:34:30,596 --> 01:34:33,669
the teachings of Origin
gave me the strength I needed.

1132
01:34:40,445 --> 01:34:43,879
There are still so many things about it
that mean a great deal to me.

1133
01:34:44,155 --> 01:34:47,220
I don't doubt that there is morality and
wisdom in it, that's what made it

1134
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,776
a such powerful law for so many people.

1135
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:53,968
I think in principle
the idea of bettering ourselves and

1136
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:56,042
seeking Ascension,

1137
01:34:56,318 --> 01:34:58,194
in one way or another,

1138
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:02,102
that's what it's all really about.

1139
01:35:03,024 --> 01:35:04,917
It might just need some revision.

1140
01:35:07,715 --> 01:35:09,712
Well, that's entirely up to you

1141
01:35:10,306 --> 01:35:11,726
and your people.

1142
01:35:12,565 --> 01:35:15,562
Though I might humbly recommend
that the part about burning people alive

1143
01:35:15,682 --> 01:35:18,359
for not following along
should be the first bit to go.

1144
01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:21,543
Perhaps throw in
some colored pictures.

1145
01:35:27,335 --> 01:35:29,660
Now I haven't asked
because I fear I know the answer.

1146
01:35:31,587 --> 01:35:33,039
But now that I'm leaving.

1147
01:35:37,097 --> 01:35:38,758
I don't exactly know

1148
01:35:38,982 --> 01:35:40,480
where my place is.

1149
01:35:42,029 --> 01:35:43,648
But I hope it's here.

1150
01:35:47,065 --> 01:35:48,029
I'm sorry.

1151
01:35:50,241 --> 01:35:52,996
I know I'll never make up
for the things I've done.

1152
01:35:54,537 --> 01:35:57,059
But I promise you I'll spend
the rest of my life trying.

1153
01:35:59,611 --> 01:36:00,541
I know.

1154
01:36:06,575 --> 01:36:07,556
So will I.

1155
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:12,322
I know I was the one who found it.
I'm not entirely happy with the fact

1156
01:36:12,442 --> 01:36:14,951
we were forced to use it{\ either}.{\But} I think
it was better than the alternative.

1157
01:36:15,123 --> 01:36:17,829
- No one disagrees with you.
- But it is a very dangerous piece

1158
01:36:17,949 --> 01:36:20,279
- of technology to keep lying around.
- It's out of my hands{\, Dr. Jackson}.

1159
01:36:20,454 --> 01:36:22,452
{\Okay, l}Let's say someone does figure how to
reprogram it.

1160
01:36:22,575 --> 01:36:24,799
Or worse, {\let's say }it falls in the wrong hands.
It could be the most

1161
01:36:24,961 --> 01:36:26,665
powerful weapon
we've ever come across.

1162
01:36:26,785 --> 01:36:29,420
I'm well aware of the risk.
So is the IOA.

1163
01:36:30,349 --> 01:36:31,244
For now,

1164
01:36:31,365 --> 01:36:34,154
the Ark is being studied at Area 51.

1165
01:36:34,274 --> 01:36:35,841
That's all I know.

1166
01:36:38,337 --> 01:36:39,973
I'm sorry, Dr. Jackson.

1167
01:36:40,472 --> 01:36:42,280
I've done all I can do.

1168
01:36:50,607 --> 01:36:53,284
It's kinda weird, not having
a big bad guy to fight any more.

1169
01:36:53,404 --> 01:36:55,518
{\Yeah, t}That's what we thought
when we defeated the Goa'uld,

1170
01:36:55,638 --> 01:36:57,687
and the Replicators, the first time.

1171
01:36:57,807 --> 01:37:00,167
Well, Jackson and Vala
took care of that.

1172
01:37:00,467 --> 01:37:02,293
That whole Ori thing
was not our fault.

1173
01:37:02,413 --> 01:37:04,289
Just take the blame,
you'll get used to it.

1174
01:37:04,899 --> 01:37:06,908
<i>We played a big part
in fixing the problem.</i>

1175
01:37:07,028 --> 01:37:08,009
<i>That, you did.</i>

1176
01:37:08,129 --> 01:37:10,057
There are still many planets
on our Gate system

1177
01:37:10,177 --> 01:37:11,486
that may remain unexplored.

1178
01:37:11,606 --> 01:37:14,917
Yes. Let's see what mysteries
P3K-546 withholds.

1179
01:37:15,037 --> 01:37:16,344
And what treasure.

1180
01:37:16,464 --> 01:37:18,032
I'm sure something will come up.

1181
01:37:18,152 --> 01:37:19,322
Walter, hit it!

1182
01:37:22,043 --> 01:37:26,059
The Projet-SG and SG-66 Teams.
