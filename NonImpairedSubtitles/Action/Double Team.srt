1
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:09,719
Quinn, Jack. Your final assignment
is classification red.

2
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:15,359
At 3:05 a truck with 32 kg . of
non-active plutonium was stolen -

3
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:20,282
- from an American installation
outside Croatia.

4
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:26,317
Stavros and his organization will
sell it to lraq within 24 hours.

5
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:31,402
Your objective is the safe return
of the plutonium to our base.

6
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:40,124
Out of the way!

7
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:43,643
Quinn's in ! The XRT is mobile.

8
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:47,516
Quinn has 1 4 hours
to reach the border.

9
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:51,760
If he does make it,
his resignation is final.

10
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:30,683
Jack, would you get that?

11
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:38,161
Kathryn !
Your damn cow is in my way!

12
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:43,799
- It's not a cow, it's a swan.
- Whatever it is, it's in my way.

13
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:47,118
In your way?

14
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:55,199
- The swan is beautiful. So are you.
- Not for long.

15
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:06,200
You'll still be sexy.
A bit rounder, and a bit softer . . .

16
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:12,397
- The baby, isn't it what we want?
- Of course.

17
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:19,117
Bonjour, Jack.

18
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:25,716
- You don't believe in front doors.
- You know all about back doors.

19
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:36,315
- How did you find me?
- We never lost you.

20
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:42,926
- Then you know I'm retired.
- How long can you watch the sunset?

21
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:46,318
You're a hunter. You miss the game.

22
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:52,198
You don't get it. For me, it's
personal. For you, it's politics.

23
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:58,283
Politics makes money, opportunity.
Everything's politics.

24
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:01,883
You want personal? Okay . . .

25
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:07,440
Stavros is back.
We want him alive.

26
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:14,286
We want all his nasty information.
Names, escape routes. We need you.

27
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:18,884
You're the only guy who knows
how he works.

28
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:25,361
Come on. It's your last shot.
A Delta team is waiting in Antwerp.

29
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:30,282
Face it, Jack.
You can't retire until he does.

30
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:43,285
- Is Quinn coming back or not?
- If he's not, we go to plan B.

31
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:52,561
Move the seat up.
It's a little tight in the rear.

32
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:56,481
That's generally true of the CIA.

33
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:05,637
You bust drug cartels in Third World
countries and testify for Congress.

34
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:11,882
They make you a deputy director,
but you're just a minor leaguer.

35
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:18,395
You were only good for getting
Quinn back. It'll be challenging.

36
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:26,198
I left you a present.

37
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,241
Get me out! Help!

38
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,727
Don't tell me it's not dangerous.

39
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:17,999
That you're going to be back
in 36 hours.

40
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:49,640
I'm looking for Yaz.

41
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:57,999
I'm looking for Yaz.

42
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:03,843
I bet that hurt.

43
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:10,277
That hurt. These hurt.
But I like this one right here.

44
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:14,122
- Who are you?
- I'm the man.

45
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:19,520
Do you judge a person
by the way he looks? I hate that.

46
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:22,201
Who does your hair,
Siegfried or Roy?

47
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:27,521
The last who mocked my hair is still
pulling his head out of his ass.

48
00:09:27,687 --> 00:09:31,600
I don't want to know
about your sex life.

49
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:37,603
- This has been fun. Who are you?
- Jack Quinn.

50
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:41,806
If you want to dance,
ask me nicely.

51
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:46,606
I just want to make sure it's you.

52
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:53,959
The legend walks. I heard
you dropped out of the game.

53
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:12,637
Santa's workshop!
Who's that, Rudolph?

54
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:18,962
- I have the best elves around.
- Christmas shopping for bad boys?

55
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:23,757
I don't play with the bad boys
any more, only the good guys.

56
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:29,604
What do you need? I got shit here
so new, I don't know I have it.

57
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:37,275
- Offence gets the glory.
- But defence wins the game.

58
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:44,125
I take cash, gold . . .
Did you open that?

59
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,525
Fire in the hole!

60
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:56,924
But no cheques. And my rule is:
You break it, you bought it.

61
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:14,838
Gentlemen, this is Delta 1 .
Forget you ever saw him.

62
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:25,163
Mr. Yamir here says Stavros will
surface tomorrow . . . close to here.

63
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:29,360
An amusement park . . .

64
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:35,683
- Who's my dead-eye?
- Me, sir.

65
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:43,606
Do you know how to use it?

66
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:50,002
It's rigged for tranquilizer darts.
Can you hit a man at 200 yards?

67
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,523
I can shoot
the dick off a hummingbird.

68
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:58,966
He's like a snake. Look in his eyes,
he'll get you in the back.

69
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:04,597
When we I D Stavros, move into
position. We only have one shot.

70
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:10,478
Two darts will kill a man.
Three, a rhino. We want him alive.

71
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:43,317
Delta 5, check the two women
by the carousel.

72
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:12,877
- Something's happening.
- We have Stavros. Grey Mercedes.

73
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:18,326
- We've got three men moving.
- Let them in.

74
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:22,765
2 and 5, move to Baker.
Others, hold.

75
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:33,319
This is way too easy.

76
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:39,926
He's in my sight.
Ready to fire.

77
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,884
That's not Stavros!

78
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:49,563
Stavros is a lefty!
It's not him !

79
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:54,243
- Find the driver!
- En route to ground positions.

80
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:06,439
- We're securing the exits.
- I got him.

81
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:12,400
The woman's hiding something.
It could be a bomb.

82
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:16,003
My God . . .

83
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:24,083
- I'm locked on.
- 2 and 5 in position.

84
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:29,082
Ready to take him.
Why are we waiting, Delta 1 ?

85
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:33,046
Ready to move in.

86
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,527
- I'm waiting for your command.
- What are you waiting for?

87
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,644
- I'm waiting for your command.
- What are you waiting for?

88
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:59,682
- Clear out!
- Too late, clown boy.

89
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:13,916
Move to position 3.

90
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:12,487
His mother told me that his
favourite thing in the world -

91
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:18,040
- was riding his little pony
on the weekends.

92
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:22,761
He loved riding that pony.

93
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:30,720
That little horse
is going to miss my boy.

94
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:39,285
I'm a professional, Quinn.
I've killed. I've killed a lot.

95
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:44,121
But most of the bastards I killed
deserved to die.

96
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:51,238
My little boy was six years old.

97
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:56,441
Now that makes it personal, mister.

98
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:56,719
Candidate for Colony residency:

99
00:21:56,887 --> 00:22:01,483
Quinn, Jack Paul. Born 1959.

100
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:04,798
Entered Foreign Service at 22.

101
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:10,564
Trained in demolition, tracking,
psychological countermeasures.

102
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:13,958
Specialty: Anti-terrorism.

103
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:18,006
Last assignment:
Stavros acquisition.

104
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:23,366
Video segment A- 19.
Antwerp interdiction.

105
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:29,363
Quinn achieved clear opportunity
to acquire Alpha, but Alpha escaped.

106
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:36,000
You went soft. But your skills
got you assigned to the Colony.

107
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:40,957
- No!
- You do have an alternative.

108
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:47,805
Nerve gas is painless and effective.
But you are already dead.

109
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:55,920
That's what your wife thinks. If you
wish to live, scan your thumbprint.

110
00:22:56,967 --> 00:23:01,518
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, -

111
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:05,123
- 5, 4, 3, 2 ...

112
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:15,881
Identity confirmed.
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.

113
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:20,006
Now, was that so bad?

114
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:39,803
Jack, glad you decided to join us.

115
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:43,323
- Alex Goldsmythe.
- The Tax Man.

116
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:49,517
- You were killed six years ago.
- It's been six years already?

117
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:55,917
Climb on.
Some friends want to meet you.

118
00:23:56,647 --> 00:24:02,005
Gentlemen,
come and meet the famed Jack Quinn.

119
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:11,883
- Moishe Levant, died in Lebanon.
- Beirut.

120
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:19,601
- Everybody . . . all ex-agents.
- Or ex-enemies.

121
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:23,999
We're too valuable to kill
and too dangerous to set free.

122
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:27,318
Welcome to the Colony.

123
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:32,445
- Quinn.
- Staal.

124
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:36,723
I understand.

125
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:51,517
This violence is not approved.

126
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:58,721
- I killed him in Tuzla.
- Apparently not well enough.

127
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:01,799
I really dislike that man.

128
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:08,122
You must wear this at all times.
It's part pager, part timer.

129
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:12,724
It tells you where to be.
When it signals, you must respond.

130
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:24,039
We're a think-tank. We're linked
to every law enforcement database.

131
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:29,281
We analyse terrorist incidents
and advise our client governments.

132
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:33,360
We're the last line of defence
against global terrorism, -

133
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:39,124
- and no one knows we exist.
What's on the menu for today?

134
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:50,920
A Global Air 747 en route
from San Francisco to Seoul.

135
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:56,358
We are interpreting signals
from the crash site.

136
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:08,437
Headset on.
Hand on the scanner at all times.

137
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:22,238
We have a feed coming in
from Washington.

138
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:31,405
I have a statement from the
Secretary on the Global Air tragedy.

139
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:36,083
Of the 1 76 passengers on board,
there are no survivors.

140
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:41,799
The CIA reports that the plane was
deliberately downed by North Korea.

141
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:47,883
The Secretary will brief you later
regarding the U. S. response.

142
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:53,804
The Koreans deny responsibility, and
the President consults his allies.

143
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:05,642
Jack, your worth is in your ability
to analyse data in times of crisis.

144
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:10,358
This is the Colony's
reason to exist.

145
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:17,320
The plane exploded from
internal malfunction. It's gone.

146
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:25,119
We've intercepted the transmission
of Global 277's voice recorder.

147
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:29,519
We've got unscheduled traffic
at heading 329 ...

148
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:37,364
It's not a pleasant prospect,
the Koreans having that technology.

149
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:42,521
Anyone with an alternative?
Anyone?

150
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:49,637
Analysis confirms the report.
Moishe, do you buy it?

151
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:53,804
I'm not sure.

152
00:27:56,087 --> 00:28:00,763
He's lying.
He's covering something up.

153
00:28:00,927 --> 00:28:05,637
- They know something about it.
- Let's examine the images.

154
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:12,123
- Hold it.
- It's a shadow.

155
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:17,077
- Bingo. An AWACS.
- No, an F-4 Weasel.

156
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:23,959
- Include it in the simulation.
- It could've been hidden.

157
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:29,281
The Koreans pick up the F-4 on radar
but shoot down the passenger jet.

158
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:34,840
The U .S. used the jumbo as cover
for data recon on a weapons test.

159
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:41,319
They were set up so the Americans
could eavesdrop on a military base.

160
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,684
Nice call, Jack.

161
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:57,956
Underwater lasers.

162
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:03,121
One metre below the surface.
They destroy anything they contact.

163
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:06,962
If they don't get you,
the undertow will.

164
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:12,326
- No one ever escaped?
- No one.

165
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:17,845
A certain Bryce was the last to try.
Before the lasers were installed.

166
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:23,365
Poor fellow didn't survive 48 hours.
His "guardian" took care of him.

167
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:28,043
Each resident has a guardian,
without knowing who it is.

168
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:34,316
The guardian observes the resident's
attitude, behaviour and production.

169
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:38,526
If the resident escapes,
the guardian terminates him.

170
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:46,321
- How have you hidden this place?
- A masking device. We're invisible.

171
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:22,605
- Hello, Kathryn?
- Hello?

172
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:28,797
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No . . .

173
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:33,836
This is Maria Trifioli
from the Galleria Luna in Rome.

174
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:42,039
We'd like to arrange an exhibition
of your sculptures. Surprised?

175
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:46,644
I'll send you a plane ticket
in the morning.

176
00:30:56,687 --> 00:31:01,807
You have five minutes
to check in at your cottages.

177
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:19,644
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 ...

178
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:26,526
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.
Please remain in contact.

179
00:31:50,447 --> 00:31:53,996
The lasers are disengaged.

180
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:20,039
Hi, I'm Maria Trifioli.
I'm glad you accepted our offer.

181
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:24,962
I'm very flattered.
But it would be so difficult . . .

182
00:33:25,127 --> 00:33:31,680
- You don't want to show your work?
- It's only four months since . . .

183
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:36,557
Perhaps this will open a new chapter
in your life.

184
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:41,847
The problem is moving to Rome.
It's so expensive . . .

185
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:48,924
Stay with us at the Regina. I'll see
that you and the baby are cared for.

186
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:56,204
Later you'll meet the gallery owner.
He's been waiting to meet you.

187
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:54,716
It's a typical Stavros operation,
and confirms our intelligence.

188
00:35:54,887 --> 00:36:03,079
But who is paying for his talents?
We anxiously await your analysis.

189
00:36:04,847 --> 00:36:09,125
What's unusual, is that
no one's claimed responsibility.

190
00:36:09,287 --> 00:36:14,759
Location: Barcelona. The Algerians
have flexed their muscles there.

191
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:19,762
They can't afford Stavros.
Maybe it's personal vengeance.

192
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:25,240
- Maybe Stavros is working alone.
- Why would he?

193
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:30,162
- Suppose it was a random act?
- Many groups are active in Spain.

194
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:40,397
- What do you think, Jack?
- No.

195
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:45,956
We await your comment.

196
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:54,047
It's not Stavros.
It's a copycat.

197
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:10,797
I also failed to get Stavros.
He's my last unpaid debt.

198
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,925
He's free, and I'm stuck here.

199
00:37:14,927 --> 00:37:21,036
You were our last hope,
the last one good enough to get him.

200
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:28,639
- Does he know about this place?
- Maybe. That's why he's dangerous.

201
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:34,245
Agencies around the world
used him for difficult work.

202
00:37:34,407 --> 00:37:38,366
When he was our ally, he was heroic.

203
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:43,726
Now he works for someone else, he's
a scalawag. He's out of fashion.

204
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:51,680
We've had to part with your swan.
I doubled the price.

205
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:58,926
My husband loved that swan.
He thought it was a cow.

206
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:49,159
You have five minutes
to check in at your cottages.

207
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:17,681
5, 4, 3, 2 ...

208
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:21,445
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.

209
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:07,717
- Let's go!
- The lasers are down !

210
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:50,637
I need help with the cable.
Give me some slack. Pull !

211
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:31,083
- Got a parachute?
- Yes!

212
00:45:08,087 --> 00:45:12,603
Fasten your seat belts.
We'll be landing soon.

213
00:45:17,127 --> 00:45:20,324
Who is his guardian?

214
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:51,085
- Boo!
- I heard they made you disappear.

215
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:56,162
- I need merchandise.
- Sorry, I'm closed for the night.

216
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:03,243
You're open now.

217
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,558
Let's talk.

218
00:46:12,727 --> 00:46:20,156
- I need some mean toys.
- You'll be the bad boy in the hood.

219
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:28,598
Check this out. Laser sight.
Automatic. You'll need a holster.

220
00:46:29,647 --> 00:46:32,844
- These are nice . . .
- Can you fly a plane?

221
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:40,322
Like a bird. But I stay on the
ground . . . Gas grenades are on sale.

222
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:48,518
You paying cash . .? I just declared
a seven-day cooling-off period.

223
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:54,796
- You know I'm good for it.
- Dead men don't get credit.

224
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:04,565
You get three CIA account numbers.
I get the stuff, you get the codes.

225
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:10,043
When I look at you,
I see nothing but trouble . . .

226
00:47:12,807 --> 00:47:16,482
What the hell . . .
I like trouble.

227
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:24,036
- A parachute?
- This is better than a parachute.

228
00:47:24,687 --> 00:47:31,763
- Are you sure this works?
- Of course.

229
00:47:31,927 --> 00:47:36,796
I'm positive it works.

230
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:41,518
If you die, you get a full refund.

231
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:46,797
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

232
00:47:47,727 --> 00:47:50,799
What are you doing?

233
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:09,600
- Give me a hand.
- How about a foot?

234
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:15,241
- Let's try something else.
- That's love, baby.

235
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:18,160
Watch your hands.

236
00:48:18,327 --> 00:48:21,683
That's what I call hang time.

237
00:48:27,687 --> 00:48:33,364
What's wrong with you?
You're crazier than my hairstylist!

238
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:38,999
- Did you test it?
- I didn't need to, I built it!

239
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:43,843
- Maybe I'll give you the codes.
- What do you mean "maybe"?

240
00:48:45,127 --> 00:48:48,039
- Trust me.
- Bite me!

241
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:36,241
Yes, Kathryn. I'm coming.

242
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,047
Your baby's due tomorrow.

243
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:32,641
Your baby's due tomorrow.

244
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:39,645
That's his heartbeat. Don't be late.
I wouldn't take this car.

245
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:46,201
I'm glad to see you can still play.
Check in to Hotel Navona in Rome.

246
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:49,518
Your baby's due tomorrow.

247
00:51:49,687 --> 00:51:56,320
That's his heartbeat. Don't be late.
I wouldn't take this car.

248
00:51:56,487 --> 00:52:02,722
I'm glad to see you can still play.
Check in to Hotel Navona in Rome.

249
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:06,277
Your baby's due tomorrow.

250
00:52:06,447 --> 00:52:10,440
That's his heartbeat ...

251
00:52:14,847 --> 00:52:18,078
Don't spoil the paint job.

252
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,445
Thanks.

253
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:27,876
I'm protecting my investment. But
this is too much. I want the codes.

254
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:35,322
- I need transportation to Rome.
- Transportation, you say?

255
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:38,684
I have some connections around here.

256
00:52:56,727 --> 00:53:02,518
If they can make it, I can steal it.
We'll blend in, in this.

257
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:06,999
So that's why you're dressed
like a carrot with earrings.

258
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:11,080
Damn bicycles.
Get out of the way!

259
00:53:11,247 --> 00:53:15,320
I have them. They're on
the autostrada to Rome.

260
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:19,639
That checks with our information.
Quin's wife is at the Regina.

261
00:53:19,807 --> 00:53:22,924
Splendid !
We've got a game going.

262
00:53:47,927 --> 00:53:52,398
- Anything for Jack Quinn?
- Si, signore. Right here.

263
00:53:58,847 --> 00:54:01,998
This was waiting for you, Quinn.

264
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:09,881
It's not a bomb.
Maybe it's the access codes.

265
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:15,121
- I'd love to get paid.
- Those accounts are fronts. Empty.

266
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:22,764
That figures. Why are you lying?
I bet the Colony doesn't even exist!

267
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:28,596
- It's not about the Colony.
- What the hell is this?

268
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:33,966
A sonogram of my son.
Stavros has my boy.

269
00:54:34,127 --> 00:54:39,201
You go back to Antwerp.
I'll get your money. I pay my debts.

270
00:54:41,847 --> 00:54:45,726
Quinn. Keep your money.

271
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:57,046
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- What for? You always play defence.

272
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:05,640
It's time to get off the bench.
The best defence is offence, right?

273
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:08,719
Right.

274
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:17,324
If we play by Stavros' rules,
my wife and son are dead.

275
00:55:17,487 --> 00:55:22,117
If you send that e-mail, it'll be
intercepted by all the agencies.

276
00:55:22,287 --> 00:55:27,077
- What's the plan?
- None. But Stavros doesn't know.

277
00:55:27,247 --> 00:55:34,801
So he'll do what he thinks I would
do, and lead us right to Kathryn.

278
00:55:44,487 --> 00:55:48,400
Quinn's clever.
A very sensitive man.

279
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:54,201
Another time, another place . . .
It's just too late.

280
00:56:03,247 --> 00:56:06,637
You're going to hospital.
You'll be safer there.

281
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:23,680
Here, sir. Look.

282
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:32,445
It's a circus.
Everybody's here.

283
00:56:32,607 --> 00:56:38,125
There's the Mossad.
Some local boys, on the corner.

284
00:56:39,607 --> 00:56:44,727
Even the carabinieri .
Holy cow, it's a full house!

285
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:50,926
- Pardon me!
- Keep moving, buddy!

286
00:56:57,567 --> 00:57:04,245
- It seems your plan isn't working.
- Patience. He'll be here.

287
00:57:04,407 --> 00:57:08,525
- If we need help, I have a brother.
- You have a brother?

288
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:11,360
Yes. In the Sancumini Chapel.

289
00:57:40,967 --> 00:57:44,596
Quinn, no!
That's what he wants.

290
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:49,318
Kathryn !

291
00:57:54,807 --> 00:57:57,446
No!

292
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:14,357
You know something, Jack?
I never break a promise.

293
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:24,763
I promise I'll send you
an invitation to the christening.

294
00:58:26,967 --> 00:58:32,644
- Think about wearing black.
- Let my wife go. Take me.

295
00:58:32,807 --> 00:58:36,197
Actually,
I'm gonna take all three of you.

296
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:44,446
I got Stavros and Quinn !

297
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:12,844
Sniper on the roof!

298
01:00:20,927 --> 01:00:25,159
- You're out of the game.
- You sure?

299
01:00:47,127 --> 01:00:51,325
He's up . . .
He's in !

300
01:00:52,687 --> 01:00:55,804
That was a five-pointer.

301
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:49,321
- Where is my wife?
- What are you talking about?

302
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:45,039
- Where's Jack?
- Don't worry, it'll be fine.

303
01:04:45,207 --> 01:04:49,246
Who are you people?

304
01:05:09,847 --> 01:05:15,797
Jack's coming. Take care of it.
He mustn't know what day it is.

305
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:36,643
Buonasera, Friar.
I'm looking for a guy named . . .

306
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:54,638
- What are these walls?
- The bones of my brothers.

307
01:05:54,807 --> 01:06:00,006
You are a friend of Brother Yaz.
He has done us many favours.

308
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:04,797
Including a mainframe
you wouldn't believe.

309
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:16,079
- What's up?
- What's up?

310
01:06:16,247 --> 01:06:23,039
This is Brother Regulo and Brother
Ramulo. This is Brother Quinn.

311
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:35,524
The monks have gathered information
on Rome for 500 years. Cybermonks!

312
01:06:35,687 --> 01:06:39,805
That prescription label you found?
He's tracing it.

313
01:06:49,287 --> 01:06:51,960
Internet . . .

314
01:06:52,127 --> 01:06:57,247
27 doctors prescribed that
medication in the last few days.

315
01:06:59,047 --> 01:07:03,245
- It's an outside signal.
- Is it going to crash?

316
01:07:03,407 --> 01:07:07,878
Where in heaven did that come from?

317
01:07:18,927 --> 01:07:21,885
May l?

318
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:27,885
Incoming message.

319
01:07:28,047 --> 01:07:32,120
"Thanks for the blessing. Jack."

320
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:44,600
He's down here somewhere.

321
01:07:47,567 --> 01:07:51,355
Man, these antiques
are worth a fortune!

322
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:55,758
In a spiritual sense.

323
01:07:55,927 --> 01:08:01,843
We are now under the Tiber River,
going towards the lsland of Tiberi.

324
01:08:02,007 --> 01:08:07,479
- Under the bridge to the hospital.
- That's where Stavros' men will be?

325
01:08:10,647 --> 01:08:15,163
- Good luck!
- Thank you, brothers.

326
01:08:15,327 --> 01:08:18,717
- Catch you on the lnternet!
- I'll wait for your e-mail.

327
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:26,202
Okay, push !
Like that! Push !

328
01:08:27,647 --> 01:08:32,163
- It's stuck! But I have something.
- What do you have?

329
01:08:35,687 --> 01:08:41,842
- What's that?
- My lucky coin, my lucky detonator.

330
01:08:44,727 --> 01:08:48,925
- Semtex.
- That's it. Handier than duck tape.

331
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:53,763
Preparation, my friend !
You've got to have the right tools.

332
01:08:55,087 --> 01:09:00,366
- Damn, not enough wire!
- Preparation, huh?

333
01:09:00,527 --> 01:09:03,121
Hold on.

334
01:09:03,927 --> 01:09:06,725
Let's find a rock.

335
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:13,120
You don't mind, do you?
It's for a good cause.

336
01:09:16,087 --> 01:09:20,444
- Oops, airball !
- You need practice, man.

337
01:09:20,607 --> 01:09:24,566
I hate practice.
But I never miss twice, brother.

338
01:09:39,047 --> 01:09:42,084
My baby!

339
01:10:02,487 --> 01:10:07,641
- He's on the island.
- Of course he is.

340
01:10:07,807 --> 01:10:13,359
I need time. Give me 60 seconds.
Then kill both the women.

341
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:24,237
Up there.

342
01:10:29,647 --> 01:10:32,445
Go, go, go!

343
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:37,837
Be careful.
You'll wind up in the hospital.

344
01:10:41,287 --> 01:10:45,041
Did you hear something?
Up there!

345
01:11:41,687 --> 01:11:46,761
- It's me! It's me.
- It's you, it's you.

346
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:55,840
This hospital is awfully quiet.

347
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:08,036
You take care of it.

348
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:13,364
They're over here . . .
Go!

349
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:17,478
What are you doing just standing . .?

350
01:12:17,647 --> 01:12:21,162
It's a hospital.
No running, please.

351
01:12:28,567 --> 01:12:31,479
Quiet.

352
01:12:36,487 --> 01:12:39,320
Let me help you down.

353
01:13:08,847 --> 01:13:12,317
Jack?

354
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:20,958
What's going on?

355
01:13:25,047 --> 01:13:28,403
No, Jack. She saved me.

356
01:13:35,567 --> 01:13:43,838
- They said you were dead.
- It's okay. I'm here.

357
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:52,082
Stavros . . . Where is he?

358
01:13:56,047 --> 01:13:59,039
Where's our son?

359
01:14:04,287 --> 01:14:09,805
- Where's my son?
- I know where they are.

360
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:15,839
You go get your boy.
I'll take care of her.

361
01:14:16,007 --> 01:14:20,762
- Thank you.
- You owe me.

362
01:14:57,447 --> 01:15:01,042
Get rid of it, or the party's over.

363
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:12,247
You know, Jack . . .
I can call you Jack, can't l?

364
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:19,085
I bet there's not a night you can
close your eyes tight enough, -

365
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:23,843
- without seeing
my little boy's face.

366
01:15:24,007 --> 01:15:27,397
I'll give you a chance
to save your son.

367
01:15:28,647 --> 01:15:33,038
If you live,
you'll get to know your son.

368
01:15:33,207 --> 01:15:38,725
And if you don't,
I'll raise him as my own.

369
01:15:38,887 --> 01:15:45,235
Men are strong, Jack.
But the tiger is stronger.

370
01:15:51,967 --> 01:15:54,276
Watch your step, Jack.

371
01:15:54,447 --> 01:15:59,760
It's okay to step on a mine,
it's stepping off that counts.

372
01:16:19,887 --> 01:16:22,481
Quinn !

373
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:26,880
Where did he come from?

374
01:16:27,607 --> 01:16:31,680
Yaz!
The crosses, they're mines.

375
01:17:36,087 --> 01:17:41,923
Don't go off and party without me.
I'll be back.

376
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:09,800
Got you !

377
01:19:05,527 --> 01:19:08,439
Jack!

378
01:19:15,207 --> 01:19:18,836
The baby's safe.
Let's get the hell out.

379
01:19:19,007 --> 01:19:23,398
You take care of my son.
I'll take care of Stavros.

380
01:20:52,087 --> 01:20:58,765
Lift your foot, my tall friend, and
that mine'll turn you to red paint.

381
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:53,281
You've got big feet, Mr. Quinn.
Be careful where you put them.

382
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:17,483
Looks like you're the bitch now,
Stavros. I forgot to tell you . . .

383
01:22:17,647 --> 01:22:23,483
You went to a lot of trouble
digging holes, putting up markers.

384
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:29,756
But I moved a couple of crosses.
Sorry!

385
01:22:29,927 --> 01:22:34,000
Yaz, behind you !

386
01:22:46,487 --> 01:22:52,164
- Where's my son?
- I'm looking ! He was right here.

387
01:23:53,287 --> 01:23:56,120
Is everybody okay?

388
01:24:07,287 --> 01:24:11,246
It's me . . . Daddy.

389
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:38,287
I want to remember
my Roman holiday.

390
01:24:40,847 --> 01:24:44,237
Give me a souvenir.

391
01:24:45,567 --> 01:24:49,879
Cut a piece of your hair.
And your shirt.

392
01:24:56,967 --> 01:25:00,926
Quinn, you may like this.
A souvenir from me.

393
01:25:02,527 --> 01:25:06,805
Maybe my coin will
be lucky for you, too.

394
01:25:20,087 --> 01:25:24,319
I'm not giving you any of
my hair, Mr. Goldsmythe.

395
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:28,963
You are a magician, Mr. Yaz.

396
01:25:33,247 --> 01:25:37,798
Now it's my turn to disappear.

397
01:25:45,447 --> 01:25:51,124
They'll blame me for this.
I wonder what the fine will be?
