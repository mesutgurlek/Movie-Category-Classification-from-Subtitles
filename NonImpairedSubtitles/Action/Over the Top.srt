00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,516
You'II see.
Excuse me.

295
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,913
- Did any of you boys ever arm-wrestIe?
- Why?

296
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,674
I got a kid here that couId beat any one
of you guys two out of three times.

297
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,110
- He's a practicaI joker. Sorry.
- He's just a shy kid.

298
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,596
As a matter of fact, I'm so sure
I'm wiIIing to put money on it.

299
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,837
Kid, if I couIdn't beat you, I'd kiII myseIf.

300
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,677
This is getting too intense.

301
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,156
- You don't have a chance against this kid.
- Yes, he does.

302
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,113
Ten to one odds.
Your one against my ten. Fair?

303
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,152
AII right. Let's go.
Ten to one odds. Right here.

304
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,159
Two out of three times.
You shouId take that off. That's not fair.

305
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,840
- You'II take him easy.
- No gIoves aIIowed.

306
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,997
OK. Concentrate, Mike. You can do it.

307
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,591
AII right, Iet's start. Ready, wimp?
His skin feeIs Iike a girI's.

308
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,914
- He is one.
- ProbabIy.

309
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,349
Don't Iisten to 'em. You hear?

310
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,835
- KiII him.
- You're gonna show 'em now.

311
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,476
You're gonna show 'em. You're gonna
do it. Over the top, Mike. Ready?

312
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,953
Start. Come on, Mike.

313
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,471
- Break his arm.
- Get this IittIe wuss! BIow the fruit away!

314
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,797
- Come on, man! AII the way!
- Come on!

315
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,869
- Yeah!
- Yeah, man!

316
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,231
- Aw, Iook at the baby.
- Aw, IittIe baby. LittIe baby.

317
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,555
- Two out of three.
- Ten out of ten.

318
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,035
- Any day, man.
- We'II take anything, man.

319
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,116
Mike!

320
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,671
What are you trying to do?

321
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,837
AII you wanted to do was embarrass me.
You did it, OK?

322
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,190
Grandfather said you were a Ioser.

323
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,437
You're trying to make me one
and I hate you for it!

324
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,553
Mike, I don't care what your
grandfather thinks about me, OK?

325
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,079
AII I care about is you.

326
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,478
Now you Iost back there because you
beat yourseIf. You Iet yourseIf get beat.

327
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,435
I know you can do it. You're a speciaI kid.
You're my boy, do you understand?

328
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,838
But you're aIso a spoiIed rich brat who's
aIways had everything done for him.

329
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,554
It's time to do it for yourseIf,
and you can do it.

330
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,356
I'm teIIing you, the worId meets nobody
haIfway. Do you understand that?

331
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,429
If you want it, Mike, you gotta take it.
Do you hear me? You gotta take it.

332
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,915
Go in there and try. I know you can win.

333
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,554
But even if you don't, so what?
So you Iose.

334
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,629
As Iong as you Iose Iike a winner, it
doesn't matter. Cos you did it with dignity.

335
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,433
If you don't go in there,
you're gonna be sorry.

336
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,552
You'II regret it your whoIe Iife,
you know what I mean?

337
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,831
Go on. I know you can do it.
WiII you do it for me?

338
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,234
Come on. Let's get him.

339
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,192
You can do it. You can beat him.

340
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,357
You're twice as strong as he is.
You just gotta beIieve.

341
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,199
You understand? AII right.

342
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,834
I thought you said he was strong.

343
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,590
WeII, my boy was just feeIing generous.
Now it's time to go to work. Huh, Mike?

344
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,869
- It's time to go to work, kid.
- Yeah.

345
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,988
- Does he think he can take me?
- I don't think so.

346
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,792
- Lock wrists.
- What a joke.

347
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,797
Through the tabIe. Smash him.

348
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,356
This is gonna hurt, wimp.
What do you think of that?

349
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,914
- I think your breath stinks.
- Go!

350
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,508
<i>- (boys shouting)
- Come on, Mike. That's good.</i>

351
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,189
That's good, Mike. Come on.
Come on, Mike. Drop the weight.

352
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,074
Over the top, Mike. Come on.
Get tough. Pump it, kid. Pump it, kid.

353
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,794
You got him, Mike.
You got him! You got him!

354
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,879
Come on, Mike. A IittIe bit more.
You got him! You got him! You got him!

355
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,595
AII right! AII right. Way to go.

356
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,872
- Come on, man. Do it again!
- He cheated. Come on. One more time.

357
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,116
Let's go, Mike. Right away.

358
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,199
- I'm gonna break your arm, punk!
- Come on. Get mad, get mad. Ready? Go.

359
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,154
Come on, Mike. You can beat him, Mike.
Harder, Mike. Over the top.

360
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,115
Pump it, kid. Pump it, kid. The power,
Mike. The power, Mike. Over the top.

361
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,676
Hey! Good, Mike. AII right. Way to go.

362
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,715
You're a tough IittIe sucker, aren't you?
That was great. Pay up now.

363
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,310
- Money, pIease.
- Money.

364
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,309
- How did he do that?
- Good genetics.

365
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,989
- Thanks. Let's go.
- Let's taIk to Mom.

366
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,749
- Come on. Right now!
- I'II beat you every day, man.

367
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,432
- I drove Dad's truck and I'm a good driver.
- Great driver.

368
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,951
And I had this arm-wrestIing match with
some guy who was bigger, maybe 5'6''.

369
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,753
- Bigger.
- No, 5'9''.

370
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,949
Bigger.

371
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,550
Mom, you wouIdn't beIieve it.
This guy was a monster!

372
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,753
Oh, that's good, darIing.
I'm so proud of you.

373
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,032
Is your father there?
Let me speak to him, OK?

374
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,755
<i>- I Iove you, sweetheart.
- OK. I Iove you too.</i>

375
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,793
- She sounds so weak.
- She'II be OK.

376
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,275
- I'm gonna be outside.
- OK, champ.

377
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,520
Hi, honey. Oh, yeah, it was a great idea
he and I spending time Iike this together.

378
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,269
I hope so. I know it won't be easy.

379
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,030
Oh, no, everything's gonna be great.
I know it is. So, how you feeIing?

380
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,950
Linc, whatever happens,
I want you to stay with him.

381
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,792
I know how difficuIt it is for you, but it's
reaIIy important. He needs you, honey.

382
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,114
I wiII.

383
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,550
PIease try to make things work
between you and my father.

384
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:01,789
He's too set in his ways to change, so
maybe you can try and understand him.

385
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,911
I'II try.

386
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,715
OK. I can't wait to see you both.

387
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,630
Christina, he's a great kid.
And I'II see you soon, OK?

388
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,193
OK.

389
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,313
- Dad!
- OK. Bye. Mike!

390
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,477
- Dad!
- Mike!

391
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,878
- Mike! Mike!
- Dad!

392
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,230
<i>Come on. (grunts)</i>

393
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,315
Dad! Dad!

394
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,750
- Why are you doing this?
- Shut up!

395
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,999
- Come on, Dad!
- Quiet, kid.

396
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,509
<i>(honking)</i>

397
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,993

398
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,228
He's stiII coming.

399
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,877
- Oh, shit. Here he comes.
- Dad!

400
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,714
Come on! Let's get the heII
out of here! Hurry!

401
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,988
He's staying with me!
You teII him that! You teII him!

402
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,509
- You OK? You aII right?
- Yeah. Are you OK?

403
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,995
- I'm aII right.
- Yeah, you'II Iive.

404
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,238
- Thanks. Come on. You sure you're OK?
- Yeah.

405
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,958
- Who were those guys anyway?
- Better ask your grandfather.

406
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,269
<i>- (sighs) Look at my truck.
- Oh, man.</i>

407
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,358
<i>(siren)</i>

408
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,433
- I got here as soon as I couId, Jason.
- Yes.

409
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,189
- We don't have much of a custody case.
- Why the heII is that?

410
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,436
I had my best researchers run down

411
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,030
every appIicabIe court case
for the Iast 100 years.

412
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,439
Bottom Iine, Jason: no judge is going
to award you custody of MichaeI.

413
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,597
The court wiII give him to Hawk
unIess he can't support him.

414
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,917
How can he support him?
The son of a bitch Iost everything.

415
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,875
He can't even support himseIf! Anyway,
there's aIways a way to bend the Iaw.

416
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,231
Isn't it your job?!
Why don't you find the IoophoIe?

417
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,635
I want my boy.

418
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,153
- Come on.
- Over the top.

419
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,874
<i>Over the top. (chuckIes)</i>

420
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,714
Oh, oh. Mercy, mercy, mercy.

421
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,997
You're getting too good.
You're gonna be a great one, kid.

422
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,238
- AImost as good as you, right?
- WeII... I think you'II be better than me.

423
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,955
- Think you're gonna do good in Vegas?
- I'm betting on it.

424
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,436
I'd Iike to get enough money together
and buy a smaII company,

425
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,599
and hire some smart guy
Iike you to be president.

426
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,950
- That's not a bad idea.
- It's a great idea.

427
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,957
But what if you Iose?

428
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,277
Hey, Mike,
you're not supposed to say that.

429
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,632
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

430
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,432
Why'd you Ieave us?

431
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,836
WeII...

432
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,869
I had some reasons.

433
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,797
That's not an answer.

434
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,276
AII I can say, Mike, is I made a mistake.
I know that.

435
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,555
You know, sometimes it happens in Iife.
We aII make mistakes.

WeIcome back to our

01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,995
We're approaching the main event.
First of aII, the semifinaIs.

Fighting wiII take pIace

<i>(announcer) They've come from every
nation on earth. 500 competitors started.</i>

Now we're down to the finaI eight.

639
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,833
<i>Let me remind you.
Let me remind you, pIease.</i>

640
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,954
This is a doubIe eIimination competition.
If you Iose twice, you're out.

641
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,958
DoubIe eIimination competition.

642
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:37,238
They've come from everywhere for
a chance to win $100,000 in prize money.

643
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:43,919
They wiII aIso have the opportunity to win
a $250,000 VoIvo White tractor truck.

644
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,271
Right now, though, Iet's introduce
our eight semifinaIists.

645
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,960
They're the best in the
worId of arm wrestIing.

646
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,071
Let's introduce John GrizzIy,

647
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,079
three-time winner from the
WorId Arm WrestIing Association.

648
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,955
When I get to the tabIe, that person, I don't
care who they are, is my mortaI enemy.

649
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,035
I hate them.

650
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,958
John GrizzIy, right here. John GrizzIy.

651
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:11,311
AIso coming up here, Mad Dog Madison.

652
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,637
I'm not so enthused about peopIe
patting me on the back,

653
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,548
saying ''You're the best.''
I don't need peopIe to do that to me.

654
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,912
If I win, it's just because I wanted
to be the best, one time in my Iife.

655
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,474
Mad Dog Madison.

656

Harry Bosco, right here. Harry Bosco.

657
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:33,399
My whoIe body is an engine. This is a
firepIug and I'm going to Iight him up.

658
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,478
<i>- (yeIIs)
- Harry Bosco!</i>

659

The Canadian champion,
two years running - CarI Adams.

660
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,917
I shouId be abIe
to bIow them away reaI easy.

661
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,919
There's a Iot more technique invoIved,
and you can't beat experience.

662
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,715
<i>- (yeIIs)
- CarI Adams, Iadies and gentIemen.</i>

663
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,917
And the newcomer from the truckers'
division, LincoIn Hawk, over here.

664
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,715
To teII you the truth, the truck
is the most important thing for me.

665
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:06,790
I don't reaIIy... It doesn't matter
if I become the champion or anything.

666
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:11,710
That's not the most important...
I... I need this truck.

667

<i>(announcer) LincoIn Hawk,

<i>- Let's hear it for BuII.

671
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:29,353
I drive a truck and arm wrestIe. It's
what I Iove to do, it's what I do best.

672
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,755

BuII, Iadies and gentIemen, trying for an
unprecedented sixth championship titIe.

674
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:43,073
Being number one is everything.
There is no second pIace. Second sucks.

675
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,670
And now, semifinaIists,
wiII you pIease take the tabIes?

676
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:51,590

Remember, Iadies and gentIemen.

696
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:01,069
This is a doubIe eIimination. Each of these
semifinaIists have another chance.

697
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,998
You have to Iose twice
to be out of the competition.

698

700
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,877
Yeah. A IittIe harder.

701
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,355
I hope I didn't tear anything.

702
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,798
Yeah, that's better.

703
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,277
- Hawk?
- What do you want?

704
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:36,758
Mr CutIer wants a word with you.
He's waiting in the presidentiaI suite.

705
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,194

708
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,639
Come in, Hawk.

709
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,190
You want a drink?
You don't have to stay sharp.

710
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,869
I understand you aIready

711
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,471
- What do you want, CutIer?
- We don't have to be enemies.

712
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,153
I never wanted to be your enemy.

713
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,397
AII right, then. Let's get right to it.

714
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,278
With Christina gone...

715
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,951
I have no famiIy Ieft in my Iife,
except for MichaeI.

716
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,395
You never had anything,
so you have nothing to Iose.

717
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,516
Hawk, you can beIieve what you want to.

718
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:44,156
But you're a deserter, pIain and simpIe.
You deserted your wife and your son.

719
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,872
You were tearing us apart.

720
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,515
Don't try to cIear your conscience
at my expense.

721
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,519
You're a Iiar. You deserted them.

722
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,795
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with you yet.

723
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,914
Come on outside.
I want to show you something. Come on!

724
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,799
Down there in the parking Iot
in front of the hoteI.

725
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,118
That's the finest rig that money can buy.
If you want it, it's yours.

726
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,148
Here's a cheque for $500,000.
Take it and get the heII out of my Iife.

727
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:34,319
What are you trying to do? I gave you
custody of the boy, I signed papers.

728
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,238
- What more do you want?
- I'm making things easy for you.

729
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,193
You don't need MichaeI
as a meaI ticket any more.

730
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:44,632
So take the truck, take the money.
Start a new Iife. Start your own famiIy!

731
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,113

That's OK. You're going to win
Iike you said, remember?

850
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,959
What I do is, I just try to take my hat

01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,398
- Hawk, back in here now.
- Don't Iet him psych you, Dad!

858
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,398
Remember what you toId me.
You can do it. I know you can!
