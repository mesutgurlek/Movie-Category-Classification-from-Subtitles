1
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,093
(dog barking)

2
00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:16,679
(motorbike engine humming)

3
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:39,579
(cell phone ringing)

4
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,007
KINTU:
Colonel Dubaku, we are

5
00:00:45,057--> 00:00:45,711
just leaving the township

6
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:46,712
now, sir.

7
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:47,713
How many do you have?

8
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:49,298
Five.

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,299
Only five?

10
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,925
By the time we got
to the field,

11
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:53,218
most of the boys
were gone.

12
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,304
I need soldiers,
not excuses.

13
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:57,639
I will bring some more, sir,
I promise.

14
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,308
Just bring them to me.

15
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:04,480
(gunfire, metallic clanking)

16
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:09,651
(gunfire, metallic clanking
continues)

17
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,742
DUBAKU: You will learn
to fight like men.

18
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:19,494
Of that,
I have no doubt.

19
00:01:19,536 --> 00:01:21,330
This...

20
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:24,833
will make you strong,
little soldiers.

21
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:28,045
This will make you free.

22
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,009
Come.

23
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,845
Take it.

24
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:42,642
How does it make you feel?

25
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:46,354
Powerful, yes?

26
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:50,692
Come.

27
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:57,282
Your mothers and
your fathers...

28
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:59,284
they have made you weak,

29
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:01,536
but General Juma...

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,663
he will make you strong.

31
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:05,165
He will make you strong

32
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:08,251
so that you can take back
the country from the government

33
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:11,755
and the traitors
that work for them...

34
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:14,090
like this cockroach here!

35
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:24,684
This cockroach

36
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:25,935
who works for
the government

37
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,354
and their white
masters... yes, yes.

38
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:31,399
MAN (crying):
Have mercy on me.

39
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:33,776
They have taken
our land.

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,949
But soon, all that will change.

41
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:42,785
Soon, all the
land will belong

42
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:44,662
to the people again.

43
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:47,123
Soldier...

44
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,210
...you must buy our freedom

45
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:53,129
with the blood
of this cockroach.

46
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,714
(sobbing)

47
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:56,841
MAN (crying):
Please, no.

48
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:59,177
And you know what
we do to cockroaches.

49
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,220
Kill the cockroach.

50
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:03,306
Kill the
cockroach!

51
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:06,225
CROWD: Kill the cockroach!
Kill the cockroach!

52
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:08,811
Kill the cockroach!
Kill the cockroach!

53
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:12,106
Kill the cockroach!
Kill the cockroach!

54
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:14,609
Kill the cockroach!
Kill the cockroach!

55
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,862
Kill the cockroach!
Kill the cockroach!

56
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:20,990
Kill the cockroach!
Kill the cockroach!

57
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:25,494
(chanting continues,
growing louder)

58
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:28,164
Kill the cockroach!
Kill the cockroach!

59
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:30,040
Kill the cockroach!
Kill the cockroach!

60
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:32,501
(boy screaming)

61
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:35,671
(crowd cheering)

62
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:09,079
I thought I told you

63
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:10,748
to turn up the
air-conditioning.

64
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:12,416
All right, sir, I do, sir.

65
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:22,426
But we need
another player.

66
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:23,594
Find somebody else.

67
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:24,928
Who? Tell me, Willie,

68
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,847
who can handle the
ball better than you?

69
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,265
That's right,
no one.

70
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:30,517
We're not supposed to go
to town without Mr. Benton.

71
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,060
Mr. Benton
worries too much.

72
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:33,270
And so do you.

73
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:35,230
BOY:
Hey, Desmond.

74
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:37,733
Hurry or the bus will leave-- come on.
Let's go.

75
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,401
You're not my father.
I'm your brother,

76
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:40,777
and you'll do
what I say.

77
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,029
No!

78
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:43,822
Fine, then.

79
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,706
(bell ringing)
The truck is here!

80
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:54,833
The truck is here!

81
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:08,305
(kids cheering)

82
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:10,390
(cheering continues)

83
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,378
# #

84
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:58,771
(gasps)

85
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:00,231
I wasn't stealing it.

86
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:01,399
I swear.

87
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:03,109
I was just looking.

88
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,160
Forgot these.

89
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:15,830
Very pretty.

90
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:17,248
For a woman, yes?

91
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,001
I was gonna give it
to my daughter one day.

92
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,420
You have a daughter?

93
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:23,713
Yeah.

94
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:26,007
Where did you get it?

95
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,925
Rajasthan.

96
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:30,261
India.

97
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:31,637
You ask a lot of questions.

98
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:33,806
That's what Mr. Benton says.

99
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,434
(chuckles)
I bet.

100
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:39,937
When were you there?

101
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:43,691
Last summer.

102
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:45,109
Before you came here?

103
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:46,152
Yes.

104
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:48,028
And before that,
where were you?

105
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:49,446
Different places.

106
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,198
When are you going home?

107
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:54,952
I'm not going home.

108
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:59,498
Look, I told the boys I'd
help them unload the truck.

109
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:01,000
If you want that,

110
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,793
you can have it.
- Really?

111
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:04,712
Really.

112
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:07,381
Willie.

113
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:10,718
You're gonna have to give me
back my knife though.

114
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,274
Go on.

115
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:28,318
BENTON:
Hey, Willie.

116
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,695
The supply
truck's here.

117
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:30,988
Want to give them
some help?

118
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,239
Look what Jack gave me.

119
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,826
Very nice.
It's from India.

120
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:37,619
Willie, go on.

121
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:40,038
Jack, this is Frank Tramell.

122
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,541
He's the ambassador's
chief political officer.

123
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:43,917
I know who he is.

124
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,045
BENTON: He says he left
some messages for you

125
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:49,589
to come see him at the embassy.
- I got his messages.

126
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:51,883
What's going on, Jack?

127
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,343
I'll tell you what's going on.

128
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:54,845
A Senate subcommittee
has questions

129
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:56,096
about the illegal detention

130
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:57,722
and torture of
certain prisoners

131
00:07:57,764 --> 00:07:59,141
in Mr. Bauer's
custody.

132
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:00,809
I have a subpoena
requesting you

133
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:03,353
to appear, and
it's way past due,

134
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,230
so consider
yourself served.

135
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,071
I told the boys I'd help them

136
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:14,572
unload the truck--
excuse me.

137
00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:17,242
Failure to comply
to a subpoena

138
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:18,952
is a federal offense,
Mr. Bauer.

139
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:20,537
You are bound
by law to respond.

140
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:21,788
Then give them my response.

141
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,415
If they want me back
in Washington,

142
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:25,041
they can come and get me.

143
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:36,094
The, uh,
ambassador said

144
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:37,262
that you and Bauer

145
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:39,764
were in Special
Forces together.

146
00:08:39,848 --> 00:08:40,932
How long has he been here?

147
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:42,600
A few months.

148
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,936
He never mentioned
a subpoena?

149
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,813
Nope.

150
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:48,856
Well, he's been ducking it
for more than a year,

151
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,483
across three
different continents.

152
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:51,859
Washington is leaning
on the ambassador

153
00:08:51,943 --> 00:08:53,319
to deliver him.

154
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:55,405
And now, the ambassador's
leaning on you.

155
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:57,156
If Bauer doesn't come
back to the States

156
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,450
on his own, they'll
come for him.

157
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:00,993
That would be a mistake.

158
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:03,705
You're doing God's
work here, Carl.

159
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:06,249
Between malaria
and the wars,

160
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:07,792
these kids never had a chance.

161
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,252
Now you're giving them
a decent life.

162
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:10,336
It'd be a shame

163
00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:11,838
if the funding
dried up.

164
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,297
Don't threaten me, Frank.

165
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:15,341
I'm just giving you the facts.

166
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:17,176
You're his friend.

167
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:19,303
Talk some damn
sense into him.

168
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:32,775
Thank you, Thomas.

169
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:37,363
There he is,

170
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:39,073
the mighty warrior

171
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:40,825
who traded his gun

172
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,993
for a wheelbarrow.

173
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:45,871
Why are you here, hmm?

174
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:48,207
To do penance for
all your sins?

175
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,211
You don't want to talk about it.

176
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:53,462
I don't blame you.

177
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:03,889
Hey, careful,
don't drop her.

178
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:11,397
The government
won't be able

179
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,232
to hold out against us
for long.

180
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:17,069
Except we have more weapons
than soldiers who can use them.

181
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:19,029
We need to overrun
the main garrison

182
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:20,697
from the west.

183
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:23,075
We have minefields
here and here.

184
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:25,077
Then I'll bring you
more little soldiers

185
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,121
to clear them-- do not worry.

186
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,293
Our father would be
really proud, Youssou.

187
00:10:34,336 --> 00:10:36,255
Very proud.

188
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:42,052
You'll have
your little soldiers.

189
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:48,975
Go.

190
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:52,020
(cell phone rings)

191
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,110
(on phone):
This is Colonel Dubaku.

192
00:10:58,151 --> 00:10:59,694
Hodges here.

193
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:02,614
I just heard
some troubling news, Colonel,

194
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:04,533
that your recruiting
numbers are,

195
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:06,868
are still coming up
a little short.

196
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:08,161
I want you to know,

197
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:09,412
my offer stands.

198
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:10,664
I've got personnel
standing by

199
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:11,873
right across the border.

200
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:13,708
They can be deployed
within the hour.

201
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,043
That won't be necessary.

202
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:16,878
Oh?

203
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:19,089
Do some thinking now, Colonel.
I'm offering you

204
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:20,465
professional soldiers,

205
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:22,509
not children that you haven't
had time to train.

206
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,094
You provided the weapons.

207
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:26,388
We will fight
our own war.

208
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:29,391
Well, it's your country.

209
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:31,476
It will be soon.

210
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:34,854
Is there anything
else, Mr. Hodges?

211
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:37,398
Yeah, tell General Juma

212
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:39,025
to give me a call

213
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,276
when he gets there,
will you?

214
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,402
I'll let him know.

215
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:42,779
Good.

216
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:56,042
That's one hard-nosed
son of a bitch.

217
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,877
It is his country.

218
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,214
But I'm paying for it.

219
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:06,386
I don't want
those transactions traceable,

220
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,554
Mr. Nichols.

221
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:13,059
Not by the SEC, the IRS,
or any of my ex-wives.

222
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:17,939
You understand me, don't you?

223
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:27,823
John, what do you
want me to tell you?

224
00:12:27,907 --> 00:12:30,284
You've got to hang in there
and be patient, my friend.

225
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:31,911
Yes, I know, I know--
hold on, hold on.

226
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:33,329
Stop, stop, we got caught
by the margin.

227
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:34,705
It's going to turn around.

228
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:36,791
Yes, yes, it is.

229
00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:38,668
Yes, it is.

230
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:41,003
Yeah, you've got to
give it time

231
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,340
and just... yeah, be patient.

232
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:46,384
Yeah. Okay.

233
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,469
Yes, yes. Okay, all right.

234
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,513
Bye-bye.

235
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,768
(intercom beeps)

236
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,811
NICHOLS (over intercom):
Chris.

237
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:58,604
(click)
Yeah?

238
00:12:58,646 --> 00:12:59,813
Would you come in here please?

239
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:04,276
(sighs)

240
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,802
Who's that guy?
A client.

241
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,512
I need you to close out

242
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:34,306
Abu Dhabi and Eritrea.

243
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:36,683
Burn the records
and bury the ashes.

244
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:40,354
Go.

245
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,360
BENTON:
Jack?

246
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:47,903
Can I have a word?

247
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,821
Yeah. Willie, go on
out to the truck.

248
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:51,865
Pick up another load.

249
00:13:57,954 --> 00:13:59,748
I think you should
take a look at this.

250
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:02,250
I don't need to.

251
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,752
I know what it says.

252
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:07,923
Don't worry, Carl.

253
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:09,090
I'll be gone by dark.

254
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:10,801
I'm not asking you
to leave, Jack.

255
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,469
I'm asking you
to have a conversation.

256
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:17,933
Tramell says this subpoena's
been chasing you

257
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:19,434
for over a year now.

258
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:21,269
It's going to catch up
with you sometime.

259
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,063
I'm not going back.

260
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:25,482
I'm not saying you should.

261
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,775
But a year's a long time

262
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:28,068
to spend looking over
your shoulder.

263
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:29,986
A lifetime of that's

264
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,446
going to drive you
out of your mind.

265
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:33,573
Whatever I've done,
I've paid for in full.

266
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,116
All I've got left is my freedom.

267
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,701
I'm not letting them
take that away from me.

268
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:39,329
"Freedom." What kind
of freedom is this, Jack?

269
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,747
You're running away.

270
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:42,415
What do you want from me, Carl?

271
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:45,752
I want you to trust me, Jack.

272
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:47,045
I am your friend.

273
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:50,465
I'm sorry.

274
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:51,966
When you called me up

275
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,887
for the first time in what,
ten years, I hoped...

276
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,889
you were maybe looking
for something more

277
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,891
than just a
place to stay...

278
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:02,852
trying to find a way to
make some sense of it all.

279
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,312
It's a normal impulse.

280
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:05,647
Especially for people like us.

281
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:08,816
Yeah, except you found
what you were looking for.

282
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:13,404
Yeah.

283
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,162
Carl?

284
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,332
Carl!

285
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,376
I just meant it's
different for me.

286
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,888
You know, I'm not so sure I have
found what I was looking for.

287
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,891
But I have found
a way to live with myself.

288
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,602
It took a long time.

289
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,438
The first thing I had to do

290
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,940
was stop running.

291
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,155
I meant what I said, Jack.

292
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:57,573
You can stay here.

293
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:59,575
Don't worry about Tramell.

294
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,702
The State Department's not

295
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:02,995
the only place
with money.

296
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:04,580
I appreciate what
you're trying to do, Carl,

297
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,457
but this is my problem.

298
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,542
I'm not gonna let it
become yours.

299
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,923
What you've done
with this place...

300
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:15,549
the school, what you've
done for the boys

301
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:16,967
is worth protecting.

302
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,639
You and I both know

303
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:23,807
it will be better
for everyone if I leave.

304
00:16:31,982 --> 00:16:34,443
Sorry, Jack.

305
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,528
Me, too.

306
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,364
Me, too.

307
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,120
Thank you, Carl.

308
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:46,997
Always.

309
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,082
Yeah.

310
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,632
SOLENZ:
You're spreading rumors.

311
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,342
You'll start a panic
over nothing.

312
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,136
THOMAS: They're not rumors.
It's the truth.

313
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:02,304
You are just a boy.

314
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:03,805
You do not know what
you are talking about.

315
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,016
THOMAS:
Juma is killing our children.

316
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:08,852
The United Nations
has no evidence of that.

317
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:10,145
What do you know?

318
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,189
This isn't even
your country, huh?

319
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,732
BENTON:
What's going on?

320
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:16,193
Thomas is
talking nonsense.

321
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:17,360
He's spreading
rumors about Juma.

322
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,987
"Rumors"?

323
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:20,071
They are not rumors.

324
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:21,698
Juma's soldiers
have been crossing

325
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,491
the border and stealing
our children.

326
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:24,659
Juma has no soldiers,

327
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:26,411
and he has no weapons.

328
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:27,829
Everyone knows that.

329
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:29,414
My cousin is missing.
He went to the market

330
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:32,208
yesterday, and he
has not returned.

331
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,127
Then it was
gun-runners who took him.

332
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,254
Or someone
from the diamond mines.

333
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:38,131
My brother is
in town with James.

334
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:39,716
You see that, hmm?

335
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,926
Now you have
the boy all worried.

336
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,053
He should be worried.

337
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:44,888
We should all be worried.
- Stop it!

338
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:46,723
Both of you.

339
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:48,892
Finish up work.
I'll go to town and see if I can

340
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:50,518
find out what's going on.
SOLENZ: Fine.

341
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,061
But you are wasting your time.

342
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:54,439
I thought I told you kids
not to go into town

343
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:55,732
without telling me.

344
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:58,359
Desmond never listens
to anyone but Desmond.

345
00:17:58,401 --> 00:17:59,903
Where'd he go?

346
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:01,237
Playing football.

347
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,073
There's a field,
just past the bridge.

348
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:06,451
I'll be back soon.
SOLENZ: Benton!

349
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:08,620
You're not seriously

350
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:10,288
worried about all of this,
are you?

351
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:11,497
If Juma was making trouble,

352
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,624
we would have
heard something, no?

353
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,793
Probably. But this is Sangala.

354
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:18,254
I'm not taking any chances.

355
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,298
(shouting playfully)

356
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:28,514
(shouting playfully)

357
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:40,943
What'd you think that was, huh?
Nothing.

358
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:42,153
What'd you say "nothing"?

359
00:18:42,236 --> 00:18:43,571
Nothing. Now, you're
going to cry?

360
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:44,989
What'd you say
"nothing," huh?

361
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:46,157
Oh, oh, wow.

362
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,742
He's so powerful, guys.
Give him a hand.

363
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:51,162
Oh, you just threw
the ball away... wow!

364
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:53,247
(arguing in foreign language)

365
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:03,841
Run!

366
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:06,093
(gunshots)

367
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:10,389
Fire!

368
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:12,224
Fire!

369
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:19,898
(man screaming)

370
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:21,692
Fire!

371
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:23,902
(yelling)

372
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:30,492
(man shouting
in foreign language)

373
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:35,080
(sporadic gunfire)

374
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:37,082
(man shouting)

375
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,462
(sporadic gunshots)
No!

376
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:43,547
(shouting)

377
00:19:55,225 --> 00:20:00,981
You are now soldiers
in the People's Freedom Army.

378
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:04,401
You will all have the honor
of fighting the imperialists

379
00:20:04,443 --> 00:20:06,361
until we have taken back
our land.

380
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,243
Samuel tells me you are
from the American school

381
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:15,078
in Okavango.

382
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,747
These Americans
make our people slaves.

383
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:19,875
But we will free you.

384
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,877
And we will free
the other children

385
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:23,712
so they can become soldiers.

386
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:28,341
Take them.

387
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:32,554
(men laughing)

388
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:41,896
Tell me your name.

389
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,440
(mumbling):
Sive.

390
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:44,607
Louder.

391
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:45,775
Sive.

392
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:47,152
Are you a baby, Sive?

393
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:50,363
I asked you a question.

394
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:52,824
Are you a baby?

395
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:53,825
SIVE:
No.

396
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:54,868
YOUSSOU:
Good.

397
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:57,454
Because we need
soldiers, Sive,

398
00:20:57,495 --> 00:21:00,456
not babies
who wet themselves.

399
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:03,334
Now stop crying, or I
will stop you myself.

400
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:05,378
DRIVER:
Commander!

401
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:07,005
Put them in the truck!

402
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:12,677
Go. Go!

403
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,107
What are
you doing?!

404
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,316
Idiot!

405
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:30,278
They are no good
to us dead!

406
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:31,529
Go!

407
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:46,405
With the inauguration
less than two hours away,

408
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:48,699
President Daniels is scheduled
to meet with his successor

409
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:51,285
here at the White House
to review final details

410
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:52,953
for the transfer of power.

411
00:21:53,036 --> 00:21:55,455
Their respective transition
teams have been working together

412
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:58,292
for several weeks to ensure
a smooth turnover.

413
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,293
(TV muted)

414
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:01,420
Stop looking at me like that.

415
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:06,258
Shouldn't you be
getting dressed? Hmm?

416
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:08,343
We've got time.

417
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:12,305
(both laugh)

418
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:13,932
(phone ringing)

419
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:21,148
Hello.

420
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:22,941
Uh, I need to talk to you, Rog.

421
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:25,360
Chris?

422
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:28,488
Uh, I think
I might be in trouble.

423
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:29,489
Okay.

424
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:32,158
(quietly):
Are you using again?

425
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:33,577
That's not what
this is about.

426
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:35,870
You didn't answer
my question.

427
00:22:35,912 --> 00:22:37,372
I can't, uh...

428
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:38,915
I can't really talk
on the phone, okay?

429
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,083
I was hoping that I could...

430
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,167
(keyless entry remote chirps)

431
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:42,585
I could meet up with you
face-to-face.

432
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,004
Now?

433
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:45,463
Hang on a sec, Rog.

434
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,759
Chris?

435
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:51,720
I know, I know, I know, I know,
it's terrible timing.

436
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:52,846
Believe me, I know.

437
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:54,431
But I wouldn't
be asking

438
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:56,224
if it wasn't
really important.

439
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:58,560
I got to leave in
45 minutes, man.

440
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:00,520
I can be there in 20.

441
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:01,521
Chris...

442
00:23:01,604 --> 00:23:02,564
I am not gonna stay long.

443
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:04,023
I swear, Rog. Just please.

444
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:06,109
Do this for me?

445
00:23:09,112 --> 00:23:10,989
Fine, but I'm out of here
in 45 minutes.

446
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:13,783
Thank you. Thank you.

447
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:20,039
You're letting Chris
come here right now?

448
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:22,458
He's having some kind
of relapse or something.

449
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,793
What am I supposed to do?
Exactly.

450
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:24,961
What are you supposed to do?

451
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:26,713
Make sure he calls his sponsor.

452
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:27,714
I don't know.

453
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:29,132
This is so Chris.

454
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:30,800
He's been a friend
for a really long time.

455
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:32,051
He got me my job.

456
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:33,052
Which, if he hadn't,

457
00:23:33,136 --> 00:23:34,303
Stop it.
I wouldn't have met you.

458
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:35,346
Don't do this.

459
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:36,889
Stop.
Hmm?

460
00:23:36,973 --> 00:23:38,933
Hmm?

461
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:40,977
Mm...

462
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:43,104
(sighs)

463
00:23:43,187 --> 00:23:44,856
(dry chuckle)

464
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:46,566
Just don't be late

465
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:50,361
for your mother's
inauguration, okay?

466
00:23:50,444 --> 00:23:53,614
(classical music playing)

467
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,533
Madame President.

468
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:56,534
Not yet.

469
00:23:56,617 --> 00:23:57,618
This way.

470
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,542
(sighs)

471
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,918
How are you feeling?

472
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:09,046
Excited.

473
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:10,965
Nervous.

474
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:12,216
You should be.

475
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:13,592
In a few hours,
you're going to be

476
00:24:13,676 --> 00:24:14,885
the most powerful person
in the world.

477
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:17,847
As if you're not already
hard enough to live with.

478
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:20,724
Ma'am. Mr. Taylor.
- Tom.

479
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:22,851
The president apologizes
he could not be here

480
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:24,478
to greet you in person,
but something urgent

481
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:25,604
has come up.

482
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:26,689
Something urgent?

483
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:30,901
Whatever it is, Tom,

484
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:33,404
it's going to land on
my desk in about two hours.

485
00:24:34,488 --> 00:24:35,906
Could I just
have a moment?

486
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,908
I'm sorry.

487
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:39,702
Don't be. Go ahead.

488
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:45,082
Our embassy in Sangala just
got word of an imminent coup.

489
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:46,333
How imminent?

490
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:47,668
Very.

491
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,753
Where's the president now?

492
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:51,130
He's in the telepresence suite.

493
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:53,674
He's on a secure line
with Prime Minister Matobo.

494
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:56,468
MATOBO:
Juma is moving his forces

495
00:24:56,552 --> 00:24:58,845
toward the capitol as we speak.

496
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:04,434
This video
was taken moments ago.

497
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:05,602
Mr. Prime
Minister,

498
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:07,688
this news has caught
us all by surprise.

499
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:10,774
But our priority here
in Washington is to ensure

500
00:25:10,816 --> 00:25:12,526
the safety of you
and your family.

501
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:16,405
My priority is to defend my
country from this monster Juma.

502
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:18,907
And the only way that can
happen is if you accelerate

503
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,784
the military assistance
your congress

504
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:22,452
has already
pledged to us.

505
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:25,497
Unfortunately, I'm not in
a position to make that happen.

506
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:29,126
Certainly not today.

507
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,585
What about
your successor?

508
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:31,586
Will she be in

509
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,339
a better position to help us?

510
00:25:34,422 --> 00:25:36,258
I'm afraid I can't
speak for her.

511
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,928
Will you excuse us for a moment?

512
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,346
Yes, of course.

513
00:25:41,388 --> 00:25:42,806
(beep)

514
00:25:43,848 --> 00:25:45,350
You were
right, sir.

515
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:46,518
Taylor does want

516
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,687
to weigh in on this.

517
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,854
Where is she?

518
00:25:49,938 --> 00:25:51,564
Just outside.

519
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:55,527
(beep)

520
00:25:55,568 --> 00:25:58,071
I'm sorry, Mr.
Prime Minister,

521
00:25:58,154 --> 00:25:59,906
but I have to
cut this short.

522
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:02,617
The president-elect
is waiting for me.

523
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,160
Please, sir,
convey to her

524
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:07,080
my request for
military assistance.

525
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:08,414
I'll do that.

526
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:11,000
(beep)

527
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,388
Mr. President.

528
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:25,431
Senator Taylor.

529
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:44,534
Tom told me what's happening
in Sangala.

530
00:26:44,617 --> 00:26:46,369
(sighs)
It is a damn tough situation.

531
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:47,870
Yeah, I don't understand.

532
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:49,205
How could Juma raise an army

533
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:51,582
without our
getting wind of it?

534
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,501
We disarmed him three years ago.

535
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:54,710
The UN's been monitoring

536
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:55,753
the situation.

537
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:58,464
Not closely enough,
apparently.

538
00:26:58,506 --> 00:27:00,633
Then you have no idea

539
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:01,717
who's supplying him?

540
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:03,469
All we know is,
Juma's secured

541
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:05,638
some fairly advanced
weapons systems,

542
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,517
which is why Prime Minister
Matobo is asking for

543
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,394
our military
assistance.

544
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:12,561
And what did you tell him?

545
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:14,230
The truth:
It's not a viable option.

546
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:18,567
You don't agree.

547
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:22,571
We have troops in the region.

548
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:23,739
A show of force

549
00:27:23,823 --> 00:27:26,492
might make Juma blink.

550
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:28,827
And if it doesn't,
we get caught up in

551
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:30,829
another civil quagmire
halfway around the world.

552
00:27:30,913 --> 00:27:33,874
Now, that is
a hard sell.

553
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:37,711
Especially when there's nothing
in Sangala worth protecting.

554
00:27:37,795 --> 00:27:41,006
No natural resources,
no substantial economic ties,

555
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:43,384
nothing that threatens
our national security.

556
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:46,762
The last time
Juma made a power grab,

557
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:49,056
he ignited a tribal war
that killed

558
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:51,892
tens of thousands of civilians.

559
00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:53,936
Our involvement
could avert a genocide.

560
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:58,106
And this war
will be tragic, too.

561
00:28:00,108 --> 00:28:03,237
But it isn't
our war.

562
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,947
Which is why I've ordered
the ambassador

563
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,198
to begin evacuating all

564
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,701
non-military
nationals.

565
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:10,744
I think that's a mistake.

566
00:28:10,827 --> 00:28:12,955
I don't want
any Americans

567
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:14,873
caught in the crossfire
when Juma starts shooting.

568
00:28:14,915 --> 00:28:18,210
Closing our embassy
sends a signal to the world

569
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:21,880
that we are willing to sell out
a democratic ally

570
00:28:21,922 --> 00:28:23,924
to a war criminal.

571
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,428
I appreciate
your idealism.

572
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:35,894
I can't say the same
for your cynicism.

573
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,774
Let's talk...

574
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:43,026
after you've been sitting
in my chair for a while.

575
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:47,614
And until then,

576
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:49,491
we still have some transition
business to go over.

577
00:28:49,574 --> 00:28:50,492
So, I suggest

578
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:53,703
we get started.

579
00:28:53,787 --> 00:28:55,288
Send in Tom Lennox.

580
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:20,980
(birds squawking in distance)

581
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:23,066
(squawking)

582
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:30,573
(squawking)

583
00:29:37,997 --> 00:29:39,207
(two gunshots)

584
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,333
(birds squawk)

585
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:41,751
(two gunshots)

586
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:52,303
(dogs barking in distance)

587
00:29:52,345 --> 00:29:54,347
No.

588
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:09,403
Desmond?

589
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:22,708
Desmond.

590
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,752
Desmond.

591
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,463
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!

592
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:29,089
Oh, that's it.

593
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:31,050
Stay with me, Desmond.
Stay with me.

594
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:34,094
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!

595
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:35,387
Do not go to sleep!

596
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:36,555
Do you understand?

597
00:30:36,597 --> 00:30:38,223
Do not go to sleep.

598
00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:40,809
Good lad.

599
00:30:40,893 --> 00:30:43,020
Don't go to sleep.

600
00:30:57,951 --> 00:30:59,745
It's not heavy.

601
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:01,997
I can carry it.

602
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:06,084
I want to go with you.

603
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:07,920
Me and my brother Desmond, too.

604
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:10,255
We can carry your things
and work for you.

605
00:31:10,297 --> 00:31:11,798
No.

606
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,675
Why not?

607
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,052
Because you can't.

608
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:18,513
(sighs)

609
00:31:18,597 --> 00:31:20,098
I'm going alone.

610
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,809
People who like
to be alone

611
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:24,519
are witches, my
grandfather says.

612
00:31:24,603 --> 00:31:26,355
Well, there you go.

613
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:28,315
Your grandfather
wouldn't be happy

614
00:31:28,357 --> 00:31:30,650
if you left here
with a witch now, would he?

615
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:32,486
He would want me
to go to America.

616
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:34,362
His favorite was Elvis Presley.

617
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:37,032
I'm not going to America.

618
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,660
Where are you
going, then?

619
00:31:40,744 --> 00:31:42,078
I don't know yet.

620
00:31:42,162 --> 00:31:44,164
I don't know yet
is better than here.

621
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:45,499
You sure about that?

622
00:31:45,582 --> 00:31:48,335
Here doesn't seem
so bad to me.

623
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:49,878
Mr. Benton
is very nice,

624
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:52,005
but there are too many ghosts
walking around.

625
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:53,506
Ghosts?

626
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:54,966
My mother,

627
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,551
my father and my three sisters.

628
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:59,137
They live in the bush
and come out at night,

629
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,514
but you wouldn't see them
because you are <i>poo-mui.</i>

630
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:02,682
<i>Poo-mui?</i>

631
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:04,225
A white person.

632
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:09,773
Willie, you and I
are friends, right?

633
00:32:11,608 --> 00:32:13,526
I want you to do me a favor
as a friend.

634
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,861
I want you to stay here

635
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:17,071
with Mr. Benton and help
take care of the other boys.

636
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:19,157
Will you do that?

637
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:22,744
You promise?

638
00:32:22,827 --> 00:32:24,871
Promise.

639
00:32:24,913 --> 00:32:26,915
Okay.

640
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,016
Thank you.

641
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:14,962
Jack!

642
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:16,130
Benton's on
Direct Connect.

643
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:17,840
He says he needs
to talk to you.

644
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:18,841
Carl?

645
00:33:18,924 --> 00:33:20,009
BENTON:
Jack,

646
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:22,470
James is dead,
Desmond's been shot.

647
00:33:22,511 --> 00:33:24,346
What happened?

648
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,639
Juma's raising an army.

649
00:33:25,723 --> 00:33:27,850
Desmond says they're
headed for the school.

650
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:29,810
They're coming for
the boys, Jack.

651
00:33:29,852 --> 00:33:31,103
You got to get them
into the shelter.

652
00:33:31,187 --> 00:33:32,271
Thomas knows where it is.

653
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:33,439
How many guns are coming?

654
00:33:33,522 --> 00:33:34,648
Maybe a dozen. I don't know.

655
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:36,734
You have to hold them off
till I get there.

656
00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:38,194
Carl, you need
to call the embassy.

657
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:40,196
Get them to send
some marines out here.

658
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,947
I've been trying.
I can't get through.

659
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:43,365
Jack, go into my room.

660
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:45,784
You'll find what you need
in a locker under my sink.

661
00:33:45,868 --> 00:33:47,369
The key's on top
of the cupboard.

662
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:48,662
How far out are you?

663
00:33:48,704 --> 00:33:50,331
Maybe five minutes.

664
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:51,874
Jack,

665
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:54,251
don't let them take my kids.

666
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:55,878
Don't let them take
the children.

667
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,047
Carl, I won't.
Everybody!

668
00:33:58,088 --> 00:34:00,007
Everybody,
I want you to listen.

669
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:02,551
I want you to go to the
shelter with Thomas.

670
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:04,052
He's gonna take
you there now.

671
00:34:04,136 --> 00:34:05,262
Go!
What's going on?

672
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:07,055
I don't have time
to explain, Willie.

673
00:34:07,097 --> 00:34:08,849
Just go with Thomas,
and ring the bell. Now!

674
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:10,767
What about my brother?
- Your brother's with Mr. Benton.

675
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:11,977
Everybody, follow me!

676
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,021
Juma's men are coming.
Do you have a weapon?

677
00:34:14,062 --> 00:34:15,564
How do you know
it's just not

678
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:17,065
another rumor?
- Do you have a weapon or not?

679
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,650
If they are coming,
I will talk to them.

680
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,068
They will listen to me.

681
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,904
Save your helmet for the parade.
There <i>are</i> coming.

682
00:34:21,987 --> 00:34:23,572
Two of our boys
have already been shot!

683
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:26,908
The United Nations remains
neutral in this matter.

684
00:34:33,749 --> 00:34:35,292
Still want to talk to them?

685
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,335
I didn't think so.

686
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:40,213
Why don't you go hide in the
shelter with the other children?

687
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:51,558
(bell ringing)

688
00:34:57,772 --> 00:34:59,774
(panting)

689
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:30,013
Are you the last?
Yeah.

690
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,975
SOLENZ:
Wait!

691
00:35:34,017 --> 00:35:35,935
Wait for me.

692
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:37,854
(panting)

693
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:47,030
Halt.

694
00:35:55,204 --> 00:35:56,539
Go!

695
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:57,707
Find the boys.

696
00:35:57,748 --> 00:35:59,000
Find them!

697
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:03,129
(explosions, man screaming)

698
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,385
(explosion)

699
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:12,847
(gunfire)

700
00:36:12,888 --> 00:36:14,056
(grunts)
(grunts)

701
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,266
Fire!

702
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:16,684
(automatic gunfire)

703
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,901
(gunfire ceases)

704
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:37,413
(grunts)

705
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,793
(explosion)

706
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:49,425
(gunshots)

707
00:36:50,634 --> 00:36:52,678
(gun clicks)

708
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:07,985
(footsteps thudding)

709
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,035
(footsteps thudding overhead)

710
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:23,417
(grunts)

711
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,294
(grunts)

712
00:37:25,335 --> 00:37:27,504
(panting)

713
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:31,675
(rapid gunfire)

714
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:35,929
(footsteps thudding overhead)

715
00:37:49,526 --> 00:37:52,320
(retreating footfalls)

716
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,369
(gunshots)

717
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,746
(automatic gunfire)

718
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:11,506
(gunfire continues)

719
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:21,683
(explosion)

720
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:25,353
(gunfire)

721
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,236
(panting)

722
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,833
(grunting)

723
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:50,128
(both grunting)

724
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:02,807
No!

725
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,184
Do not kill him yet.

726
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:08,479
Not until he tells us
where the children are hiding.

727
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:10,481
Bring him.

728
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,025
(man panting)

729
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,551
Stay here.
Stay here.

730
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:40,010
Where are you going?

731
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:42,054
I'll be back in a bit.

732
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,267
(gasping)

733
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:20,728
(helicopter blades whirring)

734
00:40:33,072 --> 00:40:34,199
U.S. citizens only.

735
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:36,701
I have a sister in Chicago.

736
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:37,869
She has a job.

737
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:39,037
She needs to sponsor you.

738
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,538
By then, it will
be too late.

739
00:40:40,622 --> 00:40:42,540
My husband died fighting Juma.

740
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:43,958
Juma will kill me.

741
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,418
He will kill my child.

742
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,045
I'm sorry.

743
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:51,716
Whatever you want me
to do for you, I will do.

744
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:57,305
Please, just take
me from here.

745
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,641
Anything at all.

746
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:01,934
(helicopter blades whirring)

747
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:03,144
I can't.

748
00:41:03,186 --> 00:41:04,395
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:06,981
Sir, it's
Carl Benton.

750
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:09,317
WOMAN:
Please don't let them

751
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:10,818
kill my baby, please!

752
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,320
Please!

753
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,950
Benton?
- I've been trying to get through to you.

754
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:19,410
Yeah, our lines
are overloaded.

755
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:20,828
Juma's men are here.

756
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,163
They're raising an army.
- We know.

757
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:23,539
You know?

758
00:41:23,623 --> 00:41:25,499
Yeah, we don't know how
he managed to pull it off.

759
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,376
No one saw it coming,
but he's got soldiers

760
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,794
and they're moving
in on the capital.

761
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:30,046
Well, they're here
right now, Frank.

762
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,422
They're at my school.

763
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:32,757
You have to send
some marines to help.

764
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,841
Well, I can't spare any.

765
00:41:33,883 --> 00:41:34,842
They're all being deployed

766
00:41:34,884 --> 00:41:36,010
for the evacuation.

767
00:41:36,052 --> 00:41:37,053
Evacuation?

768
00:41:37,136 --> 00:41:38,179
The orders came down

769
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,305
from the president.

770
00:41:39,388 --> 00:41:40,639
We're rolling up
all U.S. nationals.

771
00:41:40,723 --> 00:41:42,016
We already started ferrying
people to the border.

772
00:41:42,057 --> 00:41:43,058
Frank, look,

773
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,144
I've got 14 kids
hiding in a shelter,

774
00:41:45,227 --> 00:41:46,562
and one is gonna
bleed to death

775
00:41:46,645 --> 00:41:47,813
if he doesn't get
medical attention.

776
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:49,398
Look, if you want
us to get you out,

777
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,774
you need to get
here on your own.

778
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:52,568
The last chopper's leaving
in an hour.

779
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,321
Frank, don't... don't strand me
like this, please.

780
00:41:55,404 --> 00:41:56,864
My hands are tied, Carl.
- Frank...

781
00:41:56,906 --> 00:41:58,407
Tramell, please.
- I'm sorry.

782
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,909
Damn it!

783
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,244
Damn it.

784
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,245
(phone snaps shut)

785
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,039
(grunts)

786
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:10,294
(groans)

787
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:14,339
I'm running out of ways
to ask the question.

788
00:42:14,423 --> 00:42:16,759
Where are the children?

789
00:42:16,842 --> 00:42:18,719
You're wasting your time.

790
00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:19,970
They're not gonna find anything.

791
00:42:20,053 --> 00:42:21,889
I already told you
they're not here.

792
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,599
You're lying.

793
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:25,934
No, I'm not.

794
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:30,731
If you want to find soldiers
for your army,

795
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:32,232
you're gonna have
to look somewhere else.

796
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:41,450
Where are the children?

797
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:44,619
I told you... I don't know.

798
00:42:45,704 --> 00:42:49,291
(loud, piercing scream)

799
00:42:49,332 --> 00:42:53,211
(sustained screaming)

800
00:42:53,295 --> 00:42:54,296
(sizzling)

801
00:42:54,337 --> 00:42:57,340
(screaming with pain)

802
00:42:59,468 --> 00:43:02,387
(Jack gasping and coughing)

803
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:05,515
(labored breathing)

804
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:15,859
(grunts and groans)

805
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:20,739
(Jack grunting)

806
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:25,535
I will keep doing this
until you beg me to kill you.

807
00:43:25,577 --> 00:43:27,704
But I won't kill you
even then.

808
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:28,747
(yelling)

809
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,792
Not until you tell me
what I want to know.

810
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,085
No.

811
00:43:34,169 --> 00:43:37,046
Please, please, no, no!

812
00:43:37,088 --> 00:43:38,840
I'll show you
where the kids are.

813
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,884
Tell me.

814
00:43:40,925 --> 00:43:42,218
I need to show you.

815
00:43:42,302 --> 00:43:43,720
They're in an
underground shelter.

816
00:43:43,803 --> 00:43:45,221
No.

817
00:43:45,305 --> 00:43:48,141
You will tell me
where this shelter is.

818
00:43:48,224 --> 00:43:50,226
(crying):
Okay, okay, okay.

819
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:53,855
About 200 meters
up the footpath.

820
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:55,648
Behind the tree line

821
00:43:55,732 --> 00:43:57,775
there's a wooden hatch
under a mound of dirt.

822
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:00,611
(blubbering):
Please, please...

823
00:44:00,695 --> 00:44:02,613
Get the children.

824
00:44:02,697 --> 00:44:04,866
I'll stay here
with him.

825
00:44:04,907 --> 00:44:07,076
Don't worry.

826
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,912
Once I have these children,

827
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:12,582
I will kill you
quickly.

828
00:44:12,623 --> 00:44:15,334
(hyperventilating)

829
00:44:27,847 --> 00:44:28,931
(crying)

830
00:44:28,973 --> 00:44:30,975
(gunshots)

831
00:44:40,818 --> 00:44:42,820
(grunting)
(bones cracking)

832
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:45,156
You all right, Jack?

833
00:44:45,197 --> 00:44:46,157
Yeah.

834
00:44:46,198 --> 00:44:47,366
The kids
are in the shelter.

835
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:49,076
How is Desmond?

836
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,327
He's lost a
lot of blood.

837
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:51,996
The border's five
hours from here.

838
00:44:52,037 --> 00:44:53,998
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

839
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:56,041
I'm gonna try and get
him to the embassy.

840
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,084
They've started
evacuating already.

841
00:44:57,168 --> 00:44:58,836
How are you gonna
get the kids asylum?

842
00:44:58,878 --> 00:45:00,087
They're not U.S. nationals.

843
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,881
I've got
sponsorship papers.

844
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:03,340
Tramell's gonna
let them in,

845
00:45:03,424 --> 00:45:05,259
but I have
to go now, Jack.

846
00:45:05,342 --> 00:45:07,845
The last chopper
leaves in an hour.

847
00:45:07,886 --> 00:45:10,014
You all right?
Go, go!

848
00:45:10,097 --> 00:45:11,348
Jack...

849
00:45:11,432 --> 00:45:12,683
good luck.

850
00:45:15,436 --> 00:45:16,687
(groans)

851
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,856
(labored breathing)

852
00:45:18,939 --> 00:45:20,274
(grunts)

853
00:45:22,526 --> 00:45:23,819
Stay here.

854
00:45:23,861 --> 00:45:25,446
Jack may need our help.

855
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:26,738
And if they
catch you,

856
00:45:26,822 --> 00:45:28,657
they will make you
tell them where we are.

857
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:30,367
You are endangering
the rest of us.

858
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:31,577
We wouldn't
have been in danger

859
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,036
if you'd done something
about Juma

860
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,664
instead of looking
the other way.

861
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:41,461
BENTON:
All right.

862
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:42,713
Everyone out.

863
00:45:42,796 --> 00:45:43,839
Quickly.

864
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,882
Go to the bus, quickly.

865
00:45:45,966 --> 00:45:47,759
Thomas, go get Desmond.

866
00:45:47,843 --> 00:45:50,345
He's in the jeep by the end
of the footpath, all right?

867
00:45:50,387 --> 00:45:51,680
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

868
00:45:51,722 --> 00:45:53,306
Go to the bus, go to the bus.

869
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,433
Go to the bus.

870
00:45:54,516 --> 00:45:56,351
Where is my brother?
Thomas is gonna get him.

871
00:45:56,393 --> 00:45:58,437
Then he's all right?
He will be, he will be.

872
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,563
Go to the bus.

873
00:45:59,646 --> 00:46:01,022
Quickly, quickly.

874
00:46:07,654 --> 00:46:08,947
Desmond.

875
00:46:10,198 --> 00:46:11,616
It's not as bad
as it looks.

876
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,618
BENTON: On the bus.
Move. Quickly. Quickly.

877
00:46:13,702 --> 00:46:15,996
Solenz?

878
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,289
Where are you going?

879
00:46:17,372 --> 00:46:19,124
I told Mr. Bauer before.

880
00:46:19,165 --> 00:46:22,168
The United Nations remains
neutral in this conflict.

881
00:46:22,252 --> 00:46:24,462
A UN escort might help us
get where we need to go.

882
00:46:26,715 --> 00:46:27,757
Solenz!

883
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:29,551
JACK:
Let him go.

884
00:46:29,634 --> 00:46:31,469
He's just trying to
save his own ass

885
00:46:31,553 --> 00:46:33,805
because he knows the
children are a target.

886
00:46:35,306 --> 00:46:37,142
You're gonna need my help, Carl.

887
00:46:37,183 --> 00:46:39,352
Juma's men are gonna
set up roadblocks,

888
00:46:39,436 --> 00:46:41,146
checkpoints all the way
into the city.

889
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,856
I got one of the
soldiers' walkies.

890
00:46:42,939 --> 00:46:44,941
We can use it to try
and avoid them.

891
00:46:44,983 --> 00:46:47,819
Jack, you won't have to go
anywhere near the embassy.

892
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:49,487
Just help me get
the kids to the city.

893
00:46:49,571 --> 00:46:50,989
You can head to the
border from there.

894
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,782
Let's go.

895
00:47:01,076 --> 00:47:02,786
Yeah, thank you,
can you take it easy, please?

896
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,538
Just keep your hands
where I can see them.

897
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:05,998
I thought I told you
he's expecting me.

898
00:47:06,081 --> 00:47:07,249
Hey, Rog!

899
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,210
Rog, can you call your
watchdog off, please?

900
00:47:10,252 --> 00:47:11,420
Agent Vossler,

901
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:13,964
he's a friend of mine,
you can let him in.

902
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:15,549
Thank you.

903
00:47:15,591 --> 00:47:18,177
Your friend's jacked
up on something.

904
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,845
I'll take care of it.
It's all right.

905
00:47:19,928 --> 00:47:21,555
I'll be outside.

906
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:26,435
Look, man, um, I know
that my timing right now

907
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:29,688
must, you know,
suck, so thank you.

908
00:47:29,772 --> 00:47:31,315
Uh, it's just, I'm...

909
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:33,442
I think I'm in a little bit
of trouble here, so...

910
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:34,777
What kind of trouble?

911
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,320
Coke, pills?

912
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:38,780
Okay, you know what, don't get
all righteous on me, Rog, okay?

913
00:47:38,864 --> 00:47:40,157
I seem to remember most nights

914
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,450
you party me
under the table.

915
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:42,826
That was a long time ago.

916
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,661
Yeah, not that long ago.

917
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:48,123
All right, you got five minutes,
so talk fast.

918
00:47:51,376 --> 00:47:52,753
Uh...

919
00:47:52,794 --> 00:47:54,963
Okay... a couple months ago,

920
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,090
Nichols calls me
into his office,

921
00:47:57,132 --> 00:47:58,175
says he wants
me to manage

922
00:47:58,258 --> 00:47:59,468
a special project.

923
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:00,844
Special project?
Yeah.

924
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:02,262
That's what he calls it.

925
00:48:02,304 --> 00:48:04,639
He says that he knows that
I've taken some serious hits

926
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,349
in the stock
market, and, uh,

927
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:08,685
he's gonna give me a chance
to recover my losses.

928
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:10,020
I mean, the money
he paid me...

929
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:11,354
Rog...

930
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:13,064
(laughing):
It was crazy.

931
00:48:13,148 --> 00:48:15,150
All I had to do was
keep my mouth shut.

932
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,985
What did he have you do, Chris?
Oh, you know,

933
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,279
open a few offshore accounts,
move a bunch of money

934
00:48:19,321 --> 00:48:20,697
in and out,
that type of thing.

935
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,991
So, you helped Nichols embezzle
money from his own firm?

936
00:48:23,074 --> 00:48:24,784
Yeah, that's what I thought
I was doing at first,

937
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:27,495
but, Rog, three days ago,

938
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:29,664
recognized the prefix
on one of the accounts.

939
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:31,458
It's something the Justice
Department has red-flagged

940
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:34,377
for traders to
report, okay, so...

941
00:48:34,461 --> 00:48:35,795
do a little digging

942
00:48:35,837 --> 00:48:38,256
and, uh...

943
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,842
(incredulous sigh)

944
00:48:40,925 --> 00:48:45,054
...turns out that the, uh,
the account holder

945
00:48:45,138 --> 00:48:46,264
is on the terrorist
watch list.

946
00:48:46,347 --> 00:48:47,640
I know, it's crazy,

947
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:48,933
and it's all getting
a little too weird for me.

948
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:50,268
This morning,
there was this creepy guy

949
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:53,229
in Nichols' office who...

950
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:55,398
Look, I don't know
what he's doing.

951
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,068
I don't want to have anything
to do with it.

952
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,695
I'm willing to turn
state's evidence.

953
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,072
Yeah, good,
you should go to the FBI.

954
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:08,286
Man, I was just thinking
that, uh...

955
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:10,747
I could probably cut
a much better deal

956
00:49:10,788 --> 00:49:13,583
if we take this directly
to your mother, you know.

957
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:17,086
You want my mother
to clean up your mess?

958
00:49:18,421 --> 00:49:20,256
Chris, what do you
expect me to say to that?

959
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:21,883
What do I... I
don't know, Rog.

960
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:23,760
Uh, how about...

961
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:25,761
"I'm sorry to hear
that you're in trouble, Chris,

962
00:49:25,845 --> 00:49:27,096
"but you're a friend of mine,

963
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,890
"and I'm gonna do
whatever I can do

964
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:30,600
to help you out."

965
00:49:32,727 --> 00:49:36,022
(sighs)

966
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:37,940
Do you even have any evidence?

967
00:49:38,983 --> 00:49:40,234
(sighs)

968
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:42,570
Nichols asked me
to destroy some records.

969
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,113
I didn't do it.

970
00:49:44,196 --> 00:49:45,281
I, um...

971
00:49:45,364 --> 00:49:48,284
I sent them to my hard drive
at home instead.

972
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:50,286
They're coded,

973
00:49:50,328 --> 00:49:51,871
but, you know, they're
probably traceable.

974
00:49:51,954 --> 00:49:54,081
(approaching footfalls)

975
00:49:55,124 --> 00:49:56,625
Hello, Chris.

976
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:58,669
Hey, Sam, you look great.

977
00:49:58,753 --> 00:50:00,671
Thank you.

978
00:50:00,755 --> 00:50:02,131
We really need
to leave now.

979
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:03,215
We're already pushing it.

980
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:05,176
Agent Vossler's
in the car waiting.

981
00:50:05,259 --> 00:50:07,303
I'll meet you
there.

982
00:50:07,386 --> 00:50:08,971
I'm right behind you.

983
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:12,892
See you at work later?

984
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:14,476
Right.

985
00:50:16,729 --> 00:50:18,397
(door closing)

986
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,649
I have to go.
I know, I know, I know.

987
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:22,526
Look, look, if I forward you
these records,

988
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:24,361
will you at least
show them to your mother?

989
00:50:24,445 --> 00:50:26,572
I'm not talking to anybody
until I see them for myself.

990
00:50:26,655 --> 00:50:28,115
Okay, all right, that's...

991
00:50:28,198 --> 00:50:30,701
Look, Rog, thank you.

992
00:50:30,784 --> 00:50:32,703
Just, can you check your e-mail
in one hour?

993
00:50:33,746 --> 00:50:35,038
Clean yourself up, okay?

994
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,792
(sighs)

995
00:50:40,794 --> 00:50:43,380
16 mortar teams supported
by 20 forward observers.

996
00:50:43,422 --> 00:50:45,549
DUBAKU: Make sure we all have
the same encryption codes.

997
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:47,509
And have a backup
in case the government

998
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:49,261
tries to jam communication.

999
00:50:49,344 --> 00:50:51,805
Sir, General Juma is here.

1000
00:51:00,147 --> 00:51:01,732
Welcome home, General.

1001
00:51:03,191 --> 00:51:05,402
Colonel Dubaku.

1002
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:09,239
Look what you've built here.

1003
00:51:09,322 --> 00:51:12,909
Our American friends
have been very helpful.

1004
00:51:12,951 --> 00:51:14,911
Did they send us the howitzers?
- Yes.

1005
00:51:14,995 --> 00:51:16,955
We have them in position
about 20 kilometers

1006
00:51:17,038 --> 00:51:18,748
from the capitol.

1007
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:21,084
We can hit any
target in the city.

1008
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:24,087
All we need is your order
to begin the bombardment.

1009
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,966
Sir...
one of our checkpoints.

1010
00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:29,718
Excuse me, General.

1011
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,928
Yes?

1012
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,389
Colonel,
this is Lieutenant Kintu,

1013
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:36,016
checkpoint delta.

1014
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:38,518
We have a man in custody,
a UN relief worker.

1015
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:40,020
He was driving
to his base,

1016
00:51:40,103 --> 00:51:42,605
but we have detained
him for questioning.

1017
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:45,400
He says he has information
about your brother.

1018
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:46,776
What sort of information?

1019
00:51:46,818 --> 00:51:49,696
He says your brother
is dead, sir.

1020
00:51:51,197 --> 00:51:53,116
Your brother and his men...
they were ambushed

1021
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:54,784
at the American school.

1022
00:51:54,826 --> 00:51:59,164
He says that he can help us find
the man who killed your brother.

1023
00:52:11,259 --> 00:52:13,303
I'll be right back.

1024
00:52:16,514 --> 00:52:18,516
I managed to stop
the bleeding,

1025
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:20,727
but Desmond's
fever is spiking.

1026
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:22,562
If we don't get him
to a hospital soon,

1027
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:24,564
he's going to
go into shock.

1028
00:52:24,647 --> 00:52:26,315
We're five kilometers
from the city.

1029
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:30,445
Carl, I'm really sorry
about the school.

1030
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:33,865
I know how much you put into it.

1031
00:52:33,948 --> 00:52:36,617
Just a bunch of cement
and 2x4s, right?

1032
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:38,870
What the hell was I thinking?

1033
00:52:38,911 --> 00:52:39,871
Letting myself believe

1034
00:52:39,954 --> 00:52:41,706
that things were finally
different here,

1035
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:44,667
that this country
had turned a corner.

1036
00:52:44,709 --> 00:52:46,544
DUBAKU: The bus is from
the American school.

1037
00:52:46,627 --> 00:52:47,962
They are heading into the city

1038
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:50,423
from Okavango.

1039
00:52:50,506 --> 00:52:52,675
(scoffing): There is only
one of two roads they can go.

1040
00:52:52,717 --> 00:52:54,677
I am seeing patrols
on both.

1041
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:56,178
MAN (over radio):
This is Patrol One, sir.

1042
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,055
We have not seen a bus
matching that description.

1043
00:52:58,097 --> 00:52:59,390
Where is your position?

1044
00:52:59,432 --> 00:53:02,351
Heading east, one kilometer west
of Okavango Junction.

1045
00:53:02,393 --> 00:53:03,561
Jack,

1046
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:05,354
they're right
in front of us.

1047
00:53:05,396 --> 00:53:06,355
Everybody, hold on.

1048
00:53:06,397 --> 00:53:09,066
Hold on.

1049
00:53:17,116 --> 00:53:19,660
What is it?

1050
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,036
A rebel patrol.

1051
00:53:29,211 --> 00:53:31,588
Carl, we can't get
back on that road.

1052
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:34,466
Follow the river.

1053
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,592
It leads into
the city.

1054
00:53:35,634 --> 00:53:37,136
Desmond will not make it
that far.

1055
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:38,929
Then you help him, Thomas,

1056
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:40,764
but we're not getting
back on that road.

1057
00:53:40,806 --> 00:53:43,225
BOY:
Where are we going?

1058
00:53:43,308 --> 00:53:44,643
BENTON: We're going
to walk to the embassy.

1059
00:53:44,726 --> 00:53:47,437
Let's go, quickly, quickly.

1060
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:54,945
(quietly):
Hurry up.

1061
00:54:27,248 --> 00:54:30,918
The Decision Book.

1062
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,337
Master protocols
for the command

1063
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:37,008
and control
of our nuclear arsenal.

1064
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:39,051
I never knew how much I didn't
know till I read that book.

1065
00:54:39,135 --> 00:54:41,887
Are the gold codes in here?

1066
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:44,765
Not yet.

1067
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:48,477
Dan Wilcox will deliver them
to your designate.

1068
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:51,814
All right, then.

1069
00:54:51,856 --> 00:54:54,650
Well, if we're finished here,
I should get going.

1070
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:56,193
Join me for a drink.

1071
00:54:56,277 --> 00:54:57,319
A toast to your administration.

1072
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:59,863
As much as I'd like to,

1073
00:54:59,947 --> 00:55:01,323
it's still a little
early in the morning.

1074
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,409
You sure?

1075
00:55:03,492 --> 00:55:04,868
Yes.

1076
00:55:04,952 --> 00:55:05,953
(glass clinking)

1077
00:55:09,915 --> 00:55:11,709
To your administration.

1078
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:14,336
Thank you.

1079
00:55:14,378 --> 00:55:17,047
Thank you, Mr. President.

1080
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,387
Thank you,
Mr. President.

1081
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,230
Please extend my gratitude

1082
00:55:33,272 --> 00:55:37,192
to your transition team
for all they've done.

1083
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:44,783
You know what the talking heads
are saying?

1084
00:55:47,703 --> 00:55:49,079
They're saying
that I lost this election

1085
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:50,372
because I didn't want to win it.

1086
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:52,958
They're saying that...

1087
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,168
my heart wasn't in it.

1088
00:55:59,464 --> 00:56:01,508
What about you?

1089
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:04,636
Me?

1090
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:07,097
Do you agree with their opinion?

1091
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:13,812
I don't believe there's a simple
answer to that question.

1092
00:56:13,895 --> 00:56:17,274
(chuckles)

1093
00:56:17,357 --> 00:56:19,651
You are right.

1094
00:56:19,734 --> 00:56:22,404
Nothing about this job lends
itself to simple answers,

1095
00:56:22,487 --> 00:56:25,073
just, uh...

1096
00:56:25,156 --> 00:56:27,117
jagged edges and moving parts.

1097
00:56:27,158 --> 00:56:28,535
Most you won't even see coming

1098
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,037
till they've smacked you
in the head.

1099
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:37,836
So...

1100
00:56:42,006 --> 00:56:44,634
...be careful,

1101
00:56:44,676 --> 00:56:47,053
Madame President.

1102
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:54,435
See you at the inauguration.

1103
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,655
(door opens)

1104
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:11,953
Are you all right?

1105
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:13,371
I'm not sure yet.

1106
00:57:13,454 --> 00:57:16,999
We just got word of a coup

1107
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:18,709
in Sangala.

1108
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:21,045
Daniels has ordered
the embassy to evacuate

1109
00:57:21,128 --> 00:57:23,214
without even consulting me.
Is it the right call?

1110
00:57:23,297 --> 00:57:25,716
Right or wrong, he should have
brought me in on the decision.

1111
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:28,719
Maybe he's still bitter
about the election.

1112
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:31,973
Noah Daniels isn't
that vindictive.

1113
00:57:32,056 --> 00:57:34,308
You think he has a reason
for pulling out of Sangala

1114
00:57:34,392 --> 00:57:37,311
before you take office?

1115
00:57:37,395 --> 00:57:39,647
Maybe.

1116
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:42,233
I'll call Ethan from the car.

1117
00:57:42,316 --> 00:57:44,568
If Daniels is hiding anything
about Sangala, he'll be able

1118
00:57:44,652 --> 00:57:47,363
to dig it up.

1119
00:57:47,405 --> 00:57:49,824
MAN: It's definitely
the bus from Okavango.

1120
00:57:49,907 --> 00:57:51,409
They were here not too long ago,
at least a dozen boys.

1121
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,244
I don't care how many boys.

1122
00:57:53,327 --> 00:57:54,245
How many men?

1123
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:55,579
Just Benton,

1124
00:57:55,663 --> 00:57:56,831
or is he
with that bastard

1125
00:57:56,914 --> 00:57:58,707
that killed my brother?
There were two men.

1126
00:57:58,749 --> 00:58:01,502
Along the river would be

1127
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:02,753
their fastest route.

1128
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:04,922
Good.
JUMA: Colonel Dubaku.

1129
00:58:04,964 --> 00:58:08,926
I am sorry to hear about your
brother, but I need you here.

1130
00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:12,888
Are you ordering me to stay?

1131
00:58:12,972 --> 00:58:15,724
Our campaign is just beginning,
and you are

1132
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:17,851
critical to its success.

1133
00:58:17,935 --> 00:58:19,853
There will be time for you
to avenge your brother

1134
00:58:19,937 --> 00:58:22,940
after we have taken power.

1135
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:27,528
The man who
killed my brother

1136
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:29,571
is heading toward the
American Embassy.

1137
00:58:29,655 --> 00:58:32,074
They are evacuating
within an hour.

1138
00:58:32,157 --> 00:58:33,867
That is all the
time I have

1139
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:36,411
and all the
time I need.

1140
00:58:36,495 --> 00:58:38,789
SERGEANT:
Sir.

1141
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:40,249
Excuse me,
General.

1142
00:58:40,332 --> 00:58:42,501
Sir, the men
are ready, sir.

1143
00:58:43,502 --> 00:58:45,504
Go.

1144
00:58:48,507 --> 00:58:49,841
Go.

1145
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:17,124
Is this everything,

1146
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:19,210
Mr. Whitley?

1147
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,676
You've been stealing
financial records

1148
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:29,011
from your office.

1149
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:32,056
Those files are private
property, and I'm here

1150
01:01:32,139 --> 01:01:33,974
to recover them.

1151
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:36,227
Is this everything?

1152
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:41,774
Uh, look, I, I saw something
that didn't look right...

1153
01:01:41,857 --> 01:01:43,651
took it home to check it out--

1154
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:45,903
that's probably a mistake, and I...
- Just calm down.

1155
01:01:45,986 --> 01:01:46,987
Answer my question.

1156
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:52,618
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's everything.

1157
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:54,953
- It's all there.
What about your laptop?

1158
01:01:55,037 --> 01:01:58,165
Um, it's... it's in my briefcase
if you want to check it.

1159
01:01:58,248 --> 01:02:00,459
Did you make any hard copies?

1160
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:02,461
No, I swear.

1161
01:02:02,544 --> 01:02:04,713
I... I barely even looked
at those files.

1162
01:02:04,796 --> 01:02:07,299
Who have you shown them to?

1163
01:02:07,382 --> 01:02:09,509
No one. Nobody.

1164
01:02:22,147 --> 01:02:24,524
So, um...

1165
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:27,152
just erase it and then you take
whatever you want

1166
01:02:27,235 --> 01:02:28,445
then you leave.

1167
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:32,657
Okay?

1168
01:02:32,741 --> 01:02:34,326
Are we cool?

1169
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:35,327
Whoa.
Whoa.

1170
01:02:35,368 --> 01:02:36,328
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey,

1171
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:37,579
do we look
like fools to you?

1172
01:02:37,662 --> 01:02:38,705
Huh?
No.

1173
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:39,998
Do we, do we?
No.

1174
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:41,166
No.

1175
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:43,168
Then don't talk to us
like we are.

1176
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:45,295
Okay.
Sit down.

1177
01:02:46,713 --> 01:02:49,257
Open your shirt,
Mr. Whitley.

1178
01:02:49,341 --> 01:02:50,675
Why?

1179
01:02:50,759 --> 01:02:52,010
Your shirt.

1180
01:02:52,052 --> 01:02:54,012
What are you doing?

1181
01:02:54,054 --> 01:02:57,682
You're going to tell us
everything you know.

1182
01:02:57,724 --> 01:02:59,392
And we'll know
if you're lying.

1183
01:03:03,396 --> 01:03:04,773
Just leave it alone, okay?

1184
01:03:04,856 --> 01:03:06,775
Chris asked me
not to tell anyone.

1185
01:03:06,858 --> 01:03:08,359
I... I am not anyone.

1186
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:09,486
Come on, Sam.

1187
01:03:09,527 --> 01:03:11,321
I don't trust him.
Then trust me.

1188
01:03:14,407 --> 01:03:16,034
We're here, sir.

1189
01:03:16,117 --> 01:03:18,119
You made great
time, Edward.

1190
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:24,751
Look, I know
that Chris is your friend.

1191
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,169
It's just this idea

1192
01:03:26,211 --> 01:03:27,712
of you having some kind
of secret with him?

1193
01:03:27,795 --> 01:03:29,839
I gave him my word that
I wouldn't tell anyone.

1194
01:03:29,881 --> 01:03:32,717
You need to respect
that, okay?

1195
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,261
(sighs)

1196
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:36,679
Okay?

1197
01:03:38,556 --> 01:03:39,766
Okay.

1198
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,103
Big turnout.

1199
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:45,730
It's crazy...

1200
01:03:45,772 --> 01:03:48,691
having a mother who's
the hottest ticket in town.

1201
01:03:53,613 --> 01:03:55,615
(phone rings)

1202
01:03:58,534 --> 01:03:59,619
Vossler.

1203
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:00,786
HALCOTT:
It took some doing,

1204
01:04:00,828 --> 01:04:02,830
but we managed to recover
the files.

1205
01:04:02,914 --> 01:04:04,248
What's our exposure?

1206
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:06,959
Unclear.
We're working on it now.

1207
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,961
Find out and call me back.

1208
01:04:40,899 --> 01:04:42,526
We're clear.

1209
01:04:44,402 --> 01:04:46,238
Willie.

1210
01:04:49,074 --> 01:04:51,493
Thomas...
stay close.

1211
01:04:51,535 --> 01:04:53,078
(water gurgling)

1212
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:55,538
Jack...

1213
01:04:55,622 --> 01:04:57,999
there's a road
through those trees

1214
01:04:58,041 --> 01:04:59,501
that takes us to the city.

1215
01:04:59,584 --> 01:05:00,877
We should be safe
when we get there.

1216
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:02,879
You follow the riverbed,

1217
01:05:02,963 --> 01:05:04,923
that'll take you
to the border.

1218
01:05:05,006 --> 01:05:07,008
All right? You'll get
there before dark.

1219
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:08,176
You sure?

1220
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:10,553
Jack, we'll be fine.

1221
01:05:10,595 --> 01:05:13,598
Thanks for helping us
get this far.

1222
01:05:18,853 --> 01:05:20,355
Yeah.

1223
01:05:22,398 --> 01:05:24,734
You take care of yourself, Carl.
All right.

1224
01:05:34,577 --> 01:05:36,829
(helicopter blades whirring
in distance)

1225
01:05:39,248 --> 01:05:40,208
Carl...

1226
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:41,334
Carl.

1227
01:05:42,752 --> 01:05:44,545
(whirring grows louder)

1228
01:05:44,587 --> 01:05:46,005
Shh, shh, shh.

1229
01:05:48,925 --> 01:05:51,302
Get the kids in the trees.

1230
01:05:51,385 --> 01:05:52,720
In the trees, now! Move!

1231
01:05:55,932 --> 01:05:57,892
Run, run!

1232
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:09,779
(automatic gunfire)

1233
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:12,281
(gunshots)

1234
01:06:15,952 --> 01:06:17,495
(gunfire ceases)

1235
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:25,252
I can't see them.

1236
01:06:25,294 --> 01:06:27,463
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1237
01:06:27,546 --> 01:06:29,590
Take cover! Take cover!

1238
01:06:45,522 --> 01:06:47,149
Okay, put us down.

1239
01:06:47,191 --> 01:06:48,859
We'll follow them on foot.

1240
01:06:58,786 --> 01:06:59,953
JACK:
Come on.

1241
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:08,295
Come on.

1242
01:07:18,055 --> 01:07:20,057
Wait, come back.
Come back.

1243
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,810
Willie,
get back here.

1244
01:07:27,606 --> 01:07:29,650
Willie, stop! Stop!

1245
01:07:34,196 --> 01:07:36,490
Jack...

1246
01:07:38,241 --> 01:07:39,576
Stay there.

1247
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:41,745
Don't move.
Don't come near me.

1248
01:07:41,787 --> 01:07:43,288
I didn't want to leave this.

1249
01:07:43,371 --> 01:07:44,956
I know, I know.
It's all right.

1250
01:07:50,337 --> 01:07:51,588
Go with Thomas.

1251
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:54,591
Willie, it's all right.

1252
01:07:54,674 --> 01:07:57,093
Come with me.
Slowly, slowly.

1253
01:07:57,135 --> 01:08:00,180
Stay on the path.
Go with the other boys. Go.

1254
01:08:01,514 --> 01:08:02,724
Forget it, Jack.

1255
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:04,643
Just go.

1256
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:09,230
Take the kids and go.

1257
01:08:12,692 --> 01:08:15,445
Damn it, Jack.
There's nothing you can do.

1258
01:08:19,324 --> 01:08:22,619
Okay, it's round,
in a gray casing,

1259
01:08:22,702 --> 01:08:25,121
with a Cyrillic B,

1260
01:08:25,163 --> 01:08:26,831
and the number 291
stenciled on the side.

1261
01:08:26,873 --> 01:08:28,166
Spring-loaded.

1262
01:08:28,249 --> 01:08:30,335
Russian antipersonnel mine,
five kilo.

1263
01:08:30,376 --> 01:08:32,003
I take my weight off
and that's it.

1264
01:08:32,045 --> 01:08:34,255
I'm going to try and disassemble
the trigger mechanism.

1265
01:08:34,339 --> 01:08:35,673
It's got an anti-tamper system.

1266
01:08:35,757 --> 01:08:37,342
That's all right;
I'll find a workaround.

1267
01:08:37,383 --> 01:08:38,676
Jack, even if you had
the right tools,

1268
01:08:38,718 --> 01:08:39,969
it'd take more
than an hour to disarm...

1269
01:08:40,011 --> 01:08:41,679
Damn it, Carl, there's got to be
a kill switch,

1270
01:08:41,763 --> 01:08:43,097
just let me find it.
- There's no time, Jack.

1271
01:08:43,181 --> 01:08:44,390
Stop.
Just give me a second.

1272
01:08:44,474 --> 01:08:45,683
Jack, stop.

1273
01:08:45,725 --> 01:08:47,435
Stop!

1274
01:08:55,026 --> 01:08:56,444
It's all right, Jack.

1275
01:08:57,862 --> 01:08:59,697
I can die like this.

1276
01:08:59,781 --> 01:09:02,575
Just take the kids
to the embassy.

1277
01:09:02,658 --> 01:09:04,368
Make sure they're safe.

1278
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:06,370
Carl, don't do this.

1279
01:09:06,412 --> 01:09:09,165
Here, take, take these.

1280
01:09:09,207 --> 01:09:11,709
Papers, sponsorship papers.

1281
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:14,003
Give them to Tramell.

1282
01:09:14,045 --> 01:09:16,881
Please, Jack, please.

1283
01:09:23,137 --> 01:09:24,805
Give me the rifle.

1284
01:09:24,889 --> 01:09:26,640
Let me buy you some time, Jack.

1285
01:09:26,724 --> 01:09:28,184
Maybe more.

1286
01:09:31,062 --> 01:09:33,105
(sighs)

1287
01:09:47,411 --> 01:09:49,413
Go.

1288
01:09:50,748 --> 01:09:52,082
Go, go.

1289
01:10:02,926 --> 01:10:05,220
Go ahead with Jack.

1290
01:10:05,304 --> 01:10:07,639
BENTON:
I'll be right behind.

1291
01:10:07,723 --> 01:10:08,682
Mr. Benton!

1292
01:10:08,766 --> 01:10:10,392
I'll catch up.

1293
01:10:12,436 --> 01:10:14,354
Go, go.

1294
01:10:14,438 --> 01:10:15,898
We got to go.

1295
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:18,484
Please, come on,
let's go.

1296
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:37,836
(leaves rustling)

1297
01:10:41,048 --> 01:10:43,425
(branches snapping)

1298
01:10:43,508 --> 01:10:45,719
Yes. Okay.

1299
01:10:45,802 --> 01:10:47,262
I'll tell him.

1300
01:10:47,345 --> 01:10:49,681
Colonel, sir...

1301
01:10:49,723 --> 01:10:52,017
we cannot follow
them into the city.

1302
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,436
It's still under
government control.

1303
01:10:55,979 --> 01:10:58,440
Since when do you start
giving orders?

1304
01:10:58,523 --> 01:11:00,609
I spoke to Udo.

1305
01:11:00,692 --> 01:11:04,571
He has some men
inside the city,

1306
01:11:04,654 --> 01:11:05,780
looking for Benton
and the other man.

1307
01:11:05,864 --> 01:11:07,198
Mm.

1308
01:11:07,282 --> 01:11:10,160
With the children,
they won't be hard to find.

1309
01:11:10,201 --> 01:11:12,871
Well, I will find them
and kill them myself,

1310
01:11:12,912 --> 01:11:15,540
even if I have to go
into the city.

1311
01:11:15,623 --> 01:11:17,208
Now, go.

1312
01:11:26,092 --> 01:11:29,012
Colonel Dubaku, look.

1313
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:52,285
Who are you?

1314
01:11:52,368 --> 01:11:54,162
I'm Benton.

1315
01:11:55,663 --> 01:11:56,914
Where's your friend?

1316
01:11:56,956 --> 01:11:58,791
Which one?

1317
01:12:00,209 --> 01:12:02,128
(yells)

1318
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:04,213
(gasping)

1319
01:12:08,676 --> 01:12:09,969
Where is he?

1320
01:12:10,052 --> 01:12:13,514
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1321
01:12:16,809 --> 01:12:19,020
(grunts)

1322
01:12:20,563 --> 01:12:23,983
All right!

1323
01:12:24,025 --> 01:12:27,653
All right...

1324
01:12:27,737 --> 01:12:30,197
He's taking them...
(mutters)

1325
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:31,490
What?

1326
01:12:31,532 --> 01:12:32,950
(muttering):
He's taking them there.

1327
01:12:32,992 --> 01:12:35,911
What are you saying? Hmm?

1328
01:12:35,995 --> 01:12:37,121
What are you saying?

1329
01:12:37,163 --> 01:12:38,831
(mumbling):
He's taking them to...

1330
01:12:38,873 --> 01:12:40,791
Bring him to me.

1331
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:42,960
(grunts)

1332
01:12:46,589 --> 01:12:48,215
Go to hell.

1333
01:12:49,425 --> 01:12:52,178
(explosion echoing)

1334
01:12:59,852 --> 01:13:01,186
What was that?

1335
01:13:01,228 --> 01:13:03,147
Just keep moving.

1336
01:13:03,188 --> 01:13:04,732
Keep going.

1337
01:13:04,815 --> 01:13:06,859
Come on, move.

1338
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:40,273
(helicopter blades whirring)

1339
01:13:40,002 --> 01:13:41,545
How far to the embassy?

1340
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:42,546
Two more blocks
that way.

1341
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:44,548
But we only have
ten minutes.

1342
01:13:44,632 --> 01:13:45,925
Okay, as soon
as we get there,

1343
01:13:46,008 --> 01:13:47,343
I'm gonna give you
all the paperwork.

1344
01:13:47,384 --> 01:13:49,011
I want you to give that
to Mr. Tramell.

1345
01:13:49,053 --> 01:13:50,429
He's gonna take care of
everything from there.

1346
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:51,597
Then you're not
coming with us?

1347
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,807
No.

1348
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:54,141
Where's Mr. Benton?
- He's not coming.

1349
01:13:54,183 --> 01:13:56,018
Why?
- He's dead.

1350
01:13:57,311 --> 01:13:58,354
No!

1351
01:13:58,437 --> 01:14:00,022
He was supposed
to be behind us!

1352
01:14:00,064 --> 01:14:01,899
He said he was coming!

1353
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:03,150
Willie! Willie!

1354
01:14:03,234 --> 01:14:04,652
Willie!

1355
01:14:04,735 --> 01:14:06,445
He lied!

1356
01:14:06,528 --> 01:14:07,905
Stop it! Stop it!
- Why?!

1357
01:14:07,947 --> 01:14:09,073
Stop.
- He lied to me.

1358
01:14:09,114 --> 01:14:11,283
Why?
- Willie, Mr. Benton did not lie.

1359
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:12,868
He made one promise
to all of you boys,

1360
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:15,287
and that was to protect you and
to make sure that you were safe.

1361
01:14:15,371 --> 01:14:18,332
Mr. Benton died

1362
01:14:18,415 --> 01:14:20,250
to make sure that Juma's
soldiers couldn't follow us.

1363
01:14:20,334 --> 01:14:22,795
Mr. Benton died to make sure
you could get to the embassy.

1364
01:14:22,878 --> 01:14:25,589
Mr. Benton died to make sure
that you would be safe.

1365
01:14:27,466 --> 01:14:29,092
(sobbing)

1366
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:35,849
I'm so sorry.

1367
01:14:38,852 --> 01:14:39,937
Willie, we have to go.

1368
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:43,649
It's what Mr. Benton
would have wanted.

1369
01:14:43,732 --> 01:14:44,775
Okay?

1370
01:14:44,858 --> 01:14:45,776
You okay?

1371
01:14:45,859 --> 01:14:47,152
(sniffling)

1372
01:14:47,235 --> 01:14:48,945
Come on.
Let's go.

1373
01:14:48,987 --> 01:14:50,989
Willie, come on,
come on.

1374
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:55,994
JACK:
It's okay.

1375
01:14:56,078 --> 01:14:56,995
Come on.

1376
01:14:57,079 --> 01:14:59,122
Let's go, let's go.

1377
01:15:03,668 --> 01:15:04,753
Stop, stop.

1378
01:15:04,795 --> 01:15:06,630
Thomas, take the boys,
hide behind the car now.

1379
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:07,964
Move. Move.
Get behind the car.

1380
01:15:08,006 --> 01:15:10,258
Everybody, now.

1381
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,344
Down, down.

1382
01:15:20,477 --> 01:15:22,145
(gunshots, people screaming)

1383
01:15:22,228 --> 01:15:24,689
(automatic gunfire)

1384
01:15:24,773 --> 01:15:26,775
(people screaming)

1385
01:15:30,653 --> 01:15:32,739
(gunshot)

1386
01:15:33,823 --> 01:15:37,118
(gunshots, people screaming)

1387
01:15:52,508 --> 01:15:53,885
Kill the cockroach.

1388
01:15:54,969 --> 01:15:56,262
Kill the cockroach.

1389
01:15:56,346 --> 01:15:58,139
Put the gun down.

1390
01:15:58,222 --> 01:15:59,474
I don't want to hurt you.

1391
01:15:59,557 --> 01:16:00,725
Just put the gun down.

1392
01:16:01,726 --> 01:16:02,935
Willie, wait, wait, wait!

1393
01:16:03,019 --> 01:16:04,145
I know you're
scared.

1394
01:16:04,228 --> 01:16:05,772
Just put the gun down.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1395
01:16:07,857 --> 01:16:10,568
Just put the gun down now.

1396
01:16:14,822 --> 01:16:16,282
You see those boys?
They're just like you.

1397
01:16:16,365 --> 01:16:19,243
I'm trying to get them out of
the country somewhere safe.

1398
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:20,870
Somewhere where
no one can hurt them.

1399
01:16:20,912 --> 01:16:22,038
You can come with us.

1400
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:24,790
Just put
the gun down.

1401
01:16:24,874 --> 01:16:26,209
Come on.

1402
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,251
Just like me.

1403
01:16:27,293 --> 01:16:28,294
Watch. See?

1404
01:16:28,377 --> 01:16:30,087
It's going down.

1405
01:16:30,171 --> 01:16:31,422
Like me.

1406
01:16:31,505 --> 01:16:33,341
Come with me, I promise you
no one will hurt you.

1407
01:16:33,424 --> 01:16:34,842
(helicopter approaching)
No one will hurt you.

1408
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:40,306
THOMAS:
Come on, Jack, we have to go!

1409
01:16:40,389 --> 01:16:42,850
We have to
go now!

1410
01:16:42,933 --> 01:16:44,101
Boys!

1411
01:16:45,186 --> 01:16:46,896
Come with me now.
Come on.

1412
01:16:46,937 --> 01:16:48,022
Let's go.

1413
01:16:48,105 --> 01:16:49,982
Everybody hold hands.
Come on!

1414
01:16:50,066 --> 01:16:52,151
(helicopter blades whirring)

1415
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:55,237
("Stars and Stripes Forever"
playing)

1416
01:17:01,952 --> 01:17:03,245
Expecting a call?

1417
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:04,705
Hmm?

1418
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:06,707
This is about Chris, isn't it?

1419
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:08,876
He was supposed to send me
something 15 minutes ago.

1420
01:17:08,959 --> 01:17:10,586
Call him later.
Your mother's here.

1421
01:17:19,553 --> 01:17:21,597
It's been a long journey,
Madame President.

1422
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,890
I'm afraid we're just
getting started.

1423
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,767
Henry.

1424
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,101
Ethan.

1425
01:17:26,185 --> 01:17:28,771
Our Africa group is preparing
a brief on Sangala.

1426
01:17:28,854 --> 01:17:31,440
You'll have it on your desk
as soon as you're done here.

1427
01:17:31,523 --> 01:17:33,275
WOMAN:
Good morning.

1428
01:17:33,358 --> 01:17:34,651
MAN: Good morning. Congratulations.

1429
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:35,819
Thank you.

1430
01:17:35,861 --> 01:17:37,029
Good to see you.

1431
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:39,740
Good morning.
TAYLOR: Thank you so much.

1432
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:44,161
You look beautiful,
Madame President.

1433
01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:47,205
Thank you, Samantha.

1434
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:49,750
Father.

1435
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:52,252
It's nice to see you
on time for once.

1436
01:17:52,336 --> 01:17:53,253
Mm-hmm.

1437
01:17:53,337 --> 01:17:54,463
(chuckles)

1438
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:55,964
How are you
holding up?

1439
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:57,799
It still doesn't feel
quite real.

1440
01:17:57,883 --> 01:17:59,676
It will soon enough.

1441
01:18:05,265 --> 01:18:06,391
Whitley needed
some encouragement,

1442
01:18:06,475 --> 01:18:08,435
but he told my man everything.

1443
01:18:10,145 --> 01:18:13,064
How much does Roger Taylor know?

1444
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:14,608
Nothing you need to worry about.

1445
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,735
But he knows
Nichols was involved.

1446
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:20,030
All he knows is
that his desperate,

1447
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:22,240
drug-addicted friend
told him some crazy story.

1448
01:18:22,324 --> 01:18:24,618
He's got no evidence.

1449
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:25,619
If he finds Nichols,

1450
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:28,288
he could find me.

1451
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:29,623
Not without evidence.

1452
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:36,588
Sir, Whitley's
no longer a problem.

1453
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:39,132
We limited the damage.

1454
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,719
But you haven't
eliminated it.

1455
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:49,184
Keep your eye on Taylor.

1456
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,521
(helicopter blades whirring)

1457
01:18:53,605 --> 01:18:55,607
(people clamoring)

1458
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:05,825
(people clamoring)

1459
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:11,122
(people shouting)

1460
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:16,711
JACK:
Stay together!

1461
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,171
Sergeant!

1462
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,006
Sergeant! I
need to see

1463
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,299
Frank Tramell;
he's expecting me!

1464
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,508
Who are you?

1465
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:24,177
Jack Bauer!

1466
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:39,400
(shouting continues)

1467
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:45,865
Don't worry,
Desmond!

1468
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:46,866
We made it!

1469
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,200
We're going
to America!

1470
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:51,037
Tramell!

1471
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,832
Listen to me, I've got
14 children seeking

1472
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:55,833
political asylum.

1473
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,585
All of them are R-1 status!

1474
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,378
One of them needs
urgent medical care!

1475
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,380
Where's Benton?
He's dead!

1476
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,674
Wait! Wait!

1477
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:05,176
I've got their paperwork.

1478
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,178
Show me.

1479
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,388
Keep Desmond up.

1480
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,223
There!

1481
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:19,565
Desmond, it's all right.
Just stay with me.

1482
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:20,649
Come on!

1483
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:27,573
(helicopter approaching)

1484
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,412
They appear to be in order.

1485
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:35,414
Good! Then open the gate,
and let them in!

1486
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:37,166
There's just one small problem.

1487
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,250
They need the legal guardianship

1488
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:39,793
of a U.S. citizen.

1489
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:42,171
Guardianship?! I already
told you, Benton is dead!

1490
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:43,589
He died getting
these children here!

1491
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,716
Then don't let him
have died in vain.

1492
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:47,759
Surrender yourself
to the subpoena,

1493
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:48,969
and the Ambassador will waive

1494
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:50,304
the issue of
guardianship.

1495
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:51,972
Tramell, I am warning you,
leave me out of this.

1496
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,849
I'm afraid I can't do that.

1497
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:56,268
We are talking about
innocent children.

1498
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:58,145
Whatever happens to them
is all on you.

1499
01:20:58,228 --> 01:20:59,813
You would really
leave these children

1500
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:01,356
out here in the street, knowing

1501
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,858
what you do
about Juma?!

1502
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,151
Damn it, Frank!

1503
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,403
They'll be used
as cannon fodder!

1504
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:08,655
Or slaughtered in the soccer
stadium for entertainment!

1505
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:12,159
I am giving you the chance to
make sure that doesn't happen!

1506
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,119
The choice is yours.

1507
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,163
(people clamoring)

1508
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,920
I don't have a choice,
you son of a bitch.

1509
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:25,171
Open the gate.

1510
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:30,176
Hold on, boys.

1511
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:31,177
Hold on.

1512
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:32,512
Desmond, come on!

1513
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:33,513
No, no, no.

1514
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:35,223
You in first, Bauer.

1515
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:37,517
It's all right, Willie.

1516
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,436
It's all right.
It's all right.

1517
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:42,564
All right, take him
into custody right now.

1518
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:44,399
Let them in!
Let them in!

1519
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:48,820
Let them in!

1520
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:50,697
They're with me!

1521
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,031
Let them in, damn it!

1522
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:54,075
(people clamoring)

1523
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,005
No! Those two are with me, too!

1524
01:22:07,046 --> 01:22:09,132
All of them!
All of them!

1525
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:12,885
It's all right, Willie.

1526
01:22:12,927 --> 01:22:14,595
Just go with them.
Go with the soldiers.

1527
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:16,180
TRAMELL:
Put them on the choppers.

1528
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,224
(people clamoring)

1529
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:30,611
JACK:
It's all right.

1530
01:22:33,948 --> 01:22:36,951
(people clamoring)

1531
01:22:36,993 --> 01:22:39,912
ROSS: <i>Raise your right hand</i>
<i>and repeat after me.</i>

1532
01:22:39,954 --> 01:22:42,540
I, Allison Taylor,
do solemnly swear...

1533
01:22:42,623 --> 01:22:45,459
I, Allison Taylor,
do solemnly swear...

1534
01:22:45,501 --> 01:22:47,086
That I will faithfully
execute the office

1535
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,547
of the President of
the United States.

1536
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,090
That I will
faithfully execute

1537
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,551
the office of the President
of the United States.

1538
01:22:53,634 --> 01:22:56,846
ROSS: <i>And will to the best of</i>
<i>my ability, preserve, protect</i>

1539
01:22:56,929 --> 01:22:59,098
<i>and defend the Constitution</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

1540
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,517
And will to the best
of my ability,

1541
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,728
preserve, protect, and defend

1542
01:23:03,811 --> 01:23:06,063
the Constitution
of the United States.

1543
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,398
So help me, God.

1544
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:08,607
So help me, God.

1545
01:23:08,649 --> 01:23:10,484
Congratulations,
Madame President.

1546
01:23:10,526 --> 01:23:12,319
Thank you.
(applause)

1547
01:23:12,361 --> 01:23:13,654
Thank you.

1548
01:23:17,032 --> 01:23:19,034
(clamoring)

1549
01:23:29,503 --> 01:23:31,880
When the founders of our country

1550
01:23:31,964 --> 01:23:35,884
boldly declared America's
independence to the world,

1551
01:23:35,968 --> 01:23:38,053
they knew that they derived

1552
01:23:38,137 --> 01:23:40,222
their power to govern

1553
01:23:40,305 --> 01:23:43,100
from three basic human rights:

1554
01:23:43,183 --> 01:23:47,354
life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.

1555
01:23:49,398 --> 01:23:52,484
Today, we rededicate ourselves

1556
01:23:52,568 --> 01:23:55,070
to the preservation

1557
01:23:55,153 --> 01:23:58,490
of those inalienable rights.

1558
01:23:58,574 --> 01:24:00,158
But even as we carry forth

1559
01:24:00,242 --> 01:24:03,704
the torch lit
by those great men,

1560
01:24:03,745 --> 01:24:07,290
we need to remember,
its light doesn't

1561
01:24:07,374 --> 01:24:10,127
always shine as brightly
as it should.

1562
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:15,507
It flickers and grows dim

1563
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:18,009
because of apathy,

1564
01:24:18,093 --> 01:24:20,512
greed...

1565
01:24:20,595 --> 01:24:22,639
and fear.

1566
01:24:24,683 --> 01:24:27,394
De Tocqueville said,

1567
01:24:27,435 --> 01:24:29,020
"In every democracy,

1568
01:24:29,104 --> 01:24:33,441
the people get
the government they deserve."

1569
01:24:34,442 --> 01:24:36,861
Today...

1570
01:24:36,945 --> 01:24:39,656
I am asking each of you

1571
01:24:39,739 --> 01:24:41,783
to help me give you

1572
01:24:41,825 --> 01:24:45,286
the government you deserve.

1573
01:24:46,371 --> 01:24:49,457
We all share the responsibility

1574
01:24:49,499 --> 01:24:53,461
history has placed in our hands.

1575
01:24:53,503 --> 01:24:56,089
The future--

1576
01:24:56,131 --> 01:24:59,717
our future--

1577
01:24:59,801 --> 01:25:01,386
depends on it.

1578
01:25:12,188 --> 01:25:14,190
(people clamoring)

1579
01:25:16,985 --> 01:25:19,028
(clamoring)

1580
01:25:33,209 --> 01:25:35,211
(clamoring fades)

1581
