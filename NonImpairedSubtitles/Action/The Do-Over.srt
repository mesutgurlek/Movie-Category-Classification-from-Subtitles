1
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,981
Yeah!
Raise the roof for your class song,

2
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,318
"I'm Too Sexy"
by Right Said Fred.

3
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:32,199
Now, it's time to give it up
for your 1991 prom king and queen,

4
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,826
Ted-O and Nikki!

5
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,831
Ted-O. Ted-O.

6
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,042
Ted-O. Ted-O. Ted-O.

7
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,087
Vincent!

8
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,270
Reunions are strange.

9
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,022
They bring up a lot of
feelings about your past.

10
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,441
Were you a jock?

11
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,235
A pothead?

12
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,570
A drama club kid?

13
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,907
A loser?

14
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,828
Did you get the girl...
or did she ever even notice you?

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,332
Who did you want to be,
and who did you actually become?

16
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,629
Damn, Charlie.

17
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,424
Are you still hung up on that skank?

18
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,050
Hey.

19
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,929
You forgot the guy who showed you
your first pair of tits?

20
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,766
You're givin' me dead eyes?
It's me!

21
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,268
It's Maxi-Pad!

22
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,604
Max Kessler!

23
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,189
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.

24
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,483
I haven't seen you in forever. Wow.

25
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,819
So, how is your mother?

26
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,031
Oh, well, you wouldn't want to
check her out in the shower these days.

27
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,574
Not lookin' too good.

28
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,160
You know, I still think she might have
known that we were watching.

29
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,829
Are you kiddin' me? That's why she
winked at you in the middle.

30
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,874
You were her little Macaulay Culkin.

31
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,673
Man, these two assholes
deserve each other.

32
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,135
They actually got divorced.
They're still really good friends though.

33
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,637
I see that.

34
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,560
They had twins together,
but she got remarried.

35
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,686
Wow.

36
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,273
Imagine if her husband was here right now
watching that alcoholic hosebag

37
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,150
fucking dry hump her ex.

38
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,944
He is here, actually.

39
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:38,116
Oh, hey, congratulations.
That's good news, man.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,328
I wish you would've told me before
I called your wife an alcoholic hosebag.

41
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,205
But, that's... that's excellent.

42
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,292
Whoa. Excuse me, one second.

43
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,961
Hey, come on. Ted-O.
No, no. No... too much.

44
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,338
Oh, God.

45
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,341
Ha! I'm sorry. Whoo!

46
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,968
It's the goddamn Funky Bunch, baby!

47
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,262
I lose my shit! Every time.

48
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,974
Relax, Charlie,
we were just dancin'.

49
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,393
You don't have to make a scene.

50
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,187
He's making a scene? You're the one
getting a pap smear out here.

51
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,648
I wasn't getting a pap smear,
shit-for-brains.

52
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,732
- Hey, hey.
- No, no.

53
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,110
Here's what happened,
all right? Here's what happened.

54
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,277
I think we had a little...

55
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,947
few too many beers
and we're just gonna call it a night.

56
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,198
Okay, fine.

57
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,534
Let's go, Mr. Buzzkill. Ah!

58
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,203
You know I can't leave right now,
I'm the class treasurer.

59
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,622
I have to settle up
with the DJ and the hotel.

60
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,832
- Okay? You...
- You know what?

61
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,583
Jimmy Badboy's got a limo.

62
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,877
Now, she could just hop right in
with me if you wanted.

63
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,641
- If it's all right.
- Oh, that sounds great.

64
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,714
- Yeah?
- Let me ask my dad.

65
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,801
Hey, listen, it's better than
drinking and driving.

66
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,762
Yes, okay, fine.
I'll see you at home.

67
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,223
- It's a limousine.
- All right.

68
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,435
I'll take good care of her. Whoo!

69
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,019
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,105
If I'm remembering correctly,

71
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:54,109
Charlie McMillan always
loved himself a Bud Light.

72
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:00,657
How about that time my father took us
on the drive-along in his cop car.

73
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,701
Oh, I remember that.

74
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,745
And that guy we had to arrest,

75
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,164
who kept flashing everybody
at the 7-Eleven.

76
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,124
You stuck me in the backseat
with that guy!

77
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:13,962
Yeah, who would have thought a guy could
whack off with a set of handcuffs on?

78
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,550
Why did we ever stop hangin' out?

79
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,927
We lived right across the street
from each other.

80
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,430
I don't know.
We had different classes.

81
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,557
Yeah, you were with all the smart kids.

82
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,019
I was in shop class
making bird cages and foot stools.

83
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,270
Yeah.

84
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,105
And after your dad died...

85
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,025
Yeah, I wasn't too social after that, huh?

86
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,821
I wouldn't wish that on anybody.
Growing up without a dad.

87
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,699
But you're in Jacksonville now.

88
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,451
Tell me about yourself.
I don't know anything.

89
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,287
Remember how we said we were gonna
kick ass and take names?

90
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,371
Oh, yeah, we did.

91
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,707
You were going to invent time travel,
weren't you?

92
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,919
And you were gonna be
an FBI agent.

93
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,086
That's right.

94
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,339
Mr. Falcone, our guidance counselor,

95
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,425
said I was gonna
end up working in the morgue.

96
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,844
- He did not like you.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:07,140
But I guess old Mr. Falcone
can suck my dick.

98
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,518
Shut up! Shut...

99
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,103
Are you kidding me?
You did it?

100
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,939
Oh, my God, man!

101
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,024
Are you packin' heat?

102
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:18,944
Jesus!

103
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,363
My God.

104
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,407
Have you ever had to...
shoot anybody?

105
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,618
I don't kill and tell, Charlie.

106
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,703
These are human beings
we're talking about.

107
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:29,788
Yeah.

108
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,749
Eight people.

109
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,669
Are you kidding me, dude?
This is cra...

110
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,507
Oh... Oh, yeah, that. I...

111
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,217
I have not done that. That's...

112
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,469
I did it with you.
That was the last time.

113
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,012
Yep.

114
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,723
It's good to see me again, ain't it?

115
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,976
Wait, right...
Smoke it right here?

116
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,311
You're runnin' with the law tonight,
Charlie.

117
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,063
You're an untouchable.

118
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,275
That's right.

119
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,035
Oh... here.

120
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,079
Oh, no, I can't.

121
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,082
Fucking Bureau does random tests.
You want to get me fired?

122
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,750
Oh...

123
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,670
So, what else, Charlie?

124
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,380
Believe it or not...

125
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,717
I still actually work at the same place
I worked in high school.

126
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,844
Save & Pay Supermarket?

127
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,472
No. No, I've never worked at Save & Pay.

128
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,475
I manage the bank that's
inside of Save & Pay.

129
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,562
Palm Coast Savings Bank has
nothing to do with the supermarket.

130
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,063
Except the fact that it's in it.

131
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,983
Right, it's in it,
but that doesn't mean it's a part of it.

132
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,860
It's its own entity.

133
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,613
So if the supermarket was closed,
could I get into the bank?

134
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,114
Wouldn't happen.

135
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,658
We keep banking hours,
so we close before them.

136
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,077
You keep telling yourself that, Charlie.

137
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,497
Where you living?

138
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,166
I live in the same house.

139
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,834
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Oakmont.

140
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,171
Man, if you still had that Gremlin
piece of shit you used to drive,

141
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,714
we'd be right back in high school.

142
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,508
The old Gremlin.
I remember that.

143
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,010
Yeah, I still have it.

144
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,678
- You're shittin' me.
- Yeah.

145
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,889
- So, basically, everything...
- It's the same.

146
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,349
Yeah, it's the same.

147
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,601
But things are good, man.
Things are great.

148
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,062
It's going great, seriously.

149
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,106
Come on, let's get real.

150
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,444
Let Maxi-Pad soak up your pain.

151
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,661
My life fuckin' sucks.

152
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:33,870
Yeah.

153
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,415
I drive the same car.
I have the same job.

154
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,167
I talk to the same people.

155
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,002
I'm chasing the same girl...

156
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,129
except now I pay
all her credit card bills.

157
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,714
She still doesn't care about me.

158
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,549
I mean, I talked to these people tonight,

159
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,887
they're going parasailing,
motorcycle racing, cliff diving.

160
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,849
Oh, fuck all the people tonight.
They're all fat and old-lookin'.

161
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,935
Go to Antigua.
Jump off a cliff.

162
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,437
I'm too much of a pussy.
I would never do that.

163
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,523
Plus, I can't.
I can't go to Antigua.

164
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,817
I can't go anywhere,
I don't have a passport.

165
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,068
Oh!

166
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,779
You're not a pussy, Charlie.
You never were a pussy.

167
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,240
I'm just in a rut... a bad one.

168
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,200
I have so many responsibilities.

169
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,244
Like putting Ted-O's twins
through college?

170
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,871
Exactly, that is on the list.

171
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,666
I mean, what the hell happened to my life?

172
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,210
Can't give up hope, bud.

173
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,506
Wish I could start from scratch.
Just get it right this time.

174
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,141
Hey, maybe this is the weed,
I think there's some girl spying on us.

175
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,727
- 5'5"?
- Yeah.

176
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,936
- Dark wig?
- Yeah.

177
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,104
- Button nose?
- Yeah.

178
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,897
- Don't acknowledge her.
- Oh.

179
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,026
It's my fucking psycho ex-girlfriend.

180
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,318
Is she stalkin' you?

181
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,945
She can't quit me.

182
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,698
- I gotta talk to her.
- No, wait. Wait.

183
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,662
- I miss you.
- Well... good.

184
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,955
- Change your mind.
- Nope.

185
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,915
- Please.
- You gotta just fucking be tough.

186
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,459
Just toughen the fuck...

187
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,544
Oh, I hate you.

188
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

189
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,306
She's gonna leave you alone now.

190
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,224
No, I gave her my hotel key.

191
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,851
She drove all the way out here.

192
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,104
Might as well feed the giraffe a carrot
before I send her back to the zoo,

193
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,272
you know what I mean.

194
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,565
Damn it, man.

195
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,568
You are kicking ass and taking names.
You're doing it.

196
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,612
You should be doing that with me, Charlie.

197
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,323
- Like we always talked about.
- Yeah.

198
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,451
Hey... I hope I see you again.

199
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,994
Yeah, me, too.

200
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,186
Yeah. No, I'm here.

201
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,813
That's right.
I got dinner.

202
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,649
It's covered. I got Chinese.
Everything you want.

203
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,275
I got the six egg rolls,

204
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,444
four orange chickens,
two Kung Pao chickens.

205
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,904
Just the way you like it.

206
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,280
Oh... okay.

207
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,327
Uh... I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
Uh, you sure?

208
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,955
Two more... Two more Kung Pao chickens,
are you sure?

209
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,833
- Excuse me.
- Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

210
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,292
Are you the manager?

211
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,086
Why, yes I am.
How can I help you?

212
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,048
Can you tell me where I can find
the kitty litter aisle?

213
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,467
Actually, I'm the bank manager.

214
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,552
Oh...

215
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,305
Palm Coast Savings is a bank
and we have nothing to do with Save & Pay.

216
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,224
Kitty litter?

217
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,726
It's aisle two.

218
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,740
Hey.

219
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,659
How was karate, boys?

220
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,910
See for yourself!

221
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,457
Hey, Mom, check it out.
Charlie pissed his pants.

222
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,301
Are you sure
you're not yankin' my crank?

223
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,552
This is real?

224
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,013
All expenses paid?

225
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,223
Naples, Italy?

226
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,143
Naples, Florida?

227
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,438
Oh!
Oh, my God, we so need this.

228
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,564
- Thank you.
- What is it?

229
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,524
You are not gonna believe
what just happened.

230
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,943
I just won a two-day spa weekend

231
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,030
at the Ritz-Carlton Resort
in Naples, Florida!

232
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,489
What?

233
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,408
What? How?

234
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,578
I won the grand prize drawin'
at the reunion.

235
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,414
I don't even remember there being
a drawing at the reunion.

236
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,584
I don't remember the reunion.
But I'll fucking take it.

237
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,002
Yeah. Woo-hoo!

238
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,129
Party train.
When is it?

239
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,423
- This weekend.
- Oh, that's perfect.

240
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,550
Tracy is gonna get turnt up.

241
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,010
Tracy?

242
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,929
I thought this was our weekend together?

243
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,598
Well, Charlie, it's a spa.

244
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,351
It's totally
a girls' type of thing.

245
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,102
- Oh.
- It's... it's... Oh!

246
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,229
- Oh, okay.
- But, hey... Charlie,

247
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,690
this will give you time
to paint the garage.

248
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,983
Oh, yeah, right...

249
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,529
Oh, my God, they accept dogs!
Tracy's bringing Biscuit!

250
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,741
All right, that sounds fun.

251
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,287
Where the fuck are the fortune cookies?

252
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,382
Karate chop me, you little prick.
I wasn't ready for it.

253
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,385
You ready for this?

254
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,680
Asshole.

255
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,258
Ahoy.

256
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,802
And then it happened.

257
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,054
Permission to come aboard, skipper?

258
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,933
Permission granted, little buddy.
You ready to get your drink on?

259
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,938
Oh, my God.
That is not a Bud Light Party Ball.

260
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,690
If you put your ear to it just right,

261
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,736
you can still hear somebody puking
at a Def Leppard concert.

262
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,447
Huh? Huh?

263
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,699
Uh, but I shouldn't
have a drink right away,

264
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,786
because I popped a few Dramamine just to,
you know, help me get my sea legs.

265
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,163
- Oh...
- But, um...

266
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:54,375
I did get us some Sea-Band bracelets.

267
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,502
One of the cashiers at Save & Pay

268
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,380
said that this is a miracle worker
for her mother-in-law.

269
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,715
- I get one, too?
- Yeah.

270
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,467
Oh, thanks, man.

271
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,511
So, uh, what do you think of my boat?

272
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,140
This is... insane.
I've never seen anything like it.

273
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,642
My God, I gotta join the FBI.

274
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,436
How long have you had her?

275
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,063
She's a virgin.

276
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,940
I want you to pop her cherry.

277
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,485
- Me?
- Yeah. Grab this.

278
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,071
- What do I do?
- Come on.

279
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:27,158
- To, uh, kickin' ass and taking names!
- There he is.

280
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,911
- You fuck!
- Are you shitting me?

281
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,204
You brought it back to my...

282
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,706
I'm fucking with you. Yeah!

283
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,765
Yeah. Yeah, man.

284
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,613
Hi!

285
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,989
Hi, guys!

286
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,996
Hey, girls, come on.

287
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,874
Huh?

288
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,590
Fuck, yeah.
Thank you!

289
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,970
- Oh... Oh! "Show us your dick."
- No.

290
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,180
Show them.
Don't even think about it.

291
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,473
Let's see it.
Come on! Come on!

292
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,600
Okay. Okay.

293
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,315
- Oh!
- Boo!

294
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,361
- What the hell is that?
- Come on!

295
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,417
I couldn't believe it.

296
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,669
I was having the best time
of my adult life.

297
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,386
It was like Max and I had
never been apart.

298
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:17,393
The years melted away and we were goofy
teenagers again, having nothing but fun.

299
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,313
Max!

300
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,364
Forgetting my troubles for a while
was just what the doctor ordered.

301
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,536
- Wow!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

302
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,375
Fuckin' A, baby!
You got dinner for us!

303
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,216
Fuck you! Fuck you!

304
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,821
Deep down, I knew that soon
I'd have to get back to the real world.

305
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,907
But Max had a way
of making me forget all my...

306
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,310
Hey.

307
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,314
What's...

308
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,831
Hey, Mr. Sleepyhead.

309
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,417
What's going on?

310
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,252
Why am...
Why am I tied up?

311
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,588
I didn't want you to freak out
when you came to.

312
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,340
You think tying me to a bed's
not gonna freak me out?

313
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,426
- Where the hell am I?
- You're in a motel.

314
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,804
You were snoring your balls off
for, like, 24 hours straight.

315
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,848
Wait, what? What?

316
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,517
Yeah, I guess I went
a little heavy on the roofies.

317
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,768
You roofied me?

318
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,521
Max, please let me go.

319
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,690
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not a problem, buddy.

320
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,941
Let me get you out of there.

321
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,278
I got you in a half hitch.
You know who taught me that knot?

322
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,281
Your father,
when we went fishing that day.

323
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,868
Your equilibrium's gonna be way off
'cause of the drugs.

324
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,286
So just kind of take it easy

325
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,288
- when I get you free, okay?
- Uh-huh.

326
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,831
There you go.

327
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,462
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

328
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,759
- Charlie, I told you.
- Oh, God.

329
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,177
Come here.

330
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,096
Just do it, serial killer.
Kill me, get it over with!

331
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,974
I'm not gonna kill you.
What the fuck are you talking about?

332
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,518
Sit down.
You know why I'm not gonna kill you?

333
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,604
Because you're already dead.

334
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,689
- What?
- I did it, Charlie.

335
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,859
I pulled off the greatest magic act
of all time.

336
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,944
I made us disappear.

337
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,238
Wait, you did what?

338
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,366
I faked our deaths.

339
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,785
Charlie, look at this.

340
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:25,456
I maxed out all my credit cards'
cash advances.

341
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,876
$62,000!

342
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,504
Dead people don't have to pay their bills.

343
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,424
So Amex can blow me.
And you wanted a passport.

344
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,429
Huh?

345
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,306
Where the fuck is it?

346
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,559
Oh!

347
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:49,980
You are officially now
Dr. Ronald P. Fishman, world traveler.

348
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,486
- You were sleeping.
- I don't wanna be Dr. Ronald P. Fishman.

349
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,737
Well, you can't be Butch Ryder,

350
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,907
'cause I already put my picture
on this one, so, you snooze, you lose.

351
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,368
Max, why are you doing this?

352
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,246
So you could start from scratch.
Get a brand new life.

353
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,831
I made your wish come true.

354
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:11,335
That night... I was stoned!
I didn't know what I was saying!

355
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,295
Where's Dr. Fishman?

356
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,798
At the bottom of the ocean...
with Butch Ryder.

357
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,467
Jesus Christ,
how many people did you kill?

358
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,596
I didn't kill anybody.
I just borrowed two dead bodies.

359
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,765
Charlie, calm down.

360
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,518
You have a right to be mad,
'cause I did lie to you.

361
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,728
I'm not in the FBI.

362
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,772
I made that up 'cause I was embarrassed
of where my life turned out.

363
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,484
I am a coroner.
At the city morgue.

364
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,486
Mr. Falcone was right!

365
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,738
I stack bodies for a living.

366
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,407
Just like he uncannily predicted.

367
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,451
I can't believe this.

368
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,703
Hey, we both needed a fresh start.

369
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,206
And when these two
age-appropriate bodies rolled in...

370
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,460
no one claimed them for a week,
I... fake-cremated them.

371
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,878
And I put 'em on ice.

372
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,923
This is exactly why I had to stop
hanging out with you, Max.

373
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,925
It's coming back to me.
You're crazy.

374
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,762
This is too much. It's too much.
I can't do it. I can't.

375
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,140
Hey, you have to do this,
or we're looking at five to ten...

376
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,516
for faking our own deaths.

377
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,311
Plus, I didn't opt for the fuckin'
insurance on the boat rental.

378
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,812
So that...
that'll fuck me, man.

379
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,065
Max, I... I'm gonna go home, okay?
I gotta go home.

380
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,776
Charlie, you wanna go home?

381
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,903
To that miserable wife and those kids?

382
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,738
And the Save & Pay job?

383
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,491
I don't work at Save & fucking Pay!

384
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,535
Charlie...

385
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,121
you tried.

386
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,920
- Go on.
- Um...

387
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,964
You made a good casserole.

388
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,635
I feel real sad that you were a Democrat.

389
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,969
And, um...

390
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,056
I don't know what else to say.

391
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,767
I think you said it all, baby.
I think you said it all.

392
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,648
Charlie McMillan and I went
to school together our entire lives.

393
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,150
The first time I actually noticed him...

394
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,528
was when he turned up at the firehouse

395
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:04,114
to ask for my ex-wife's hand in marriage.

396
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,659
Now, I didn't know whether to hit him...

397
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,035
or hug him!

398
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,455
Predictable.

399
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,332
Reliable.

400
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,334
Dependable!

401
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,670
I'm not just talking about my Ford F-150.

402
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,632
Talkin' about Charlie McMillan,
who I know for a fact,

403
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,217
would want us to wrap this up

404
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,140
so we can get home and watch
the Dolphins game.

405
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,513
Am I right?
Five and two this season.

406
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,640
Can I get a "Go Fish"?

407
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,059
Let's go win this one for Charlie!
Come on, honey.

408
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,064
- Aw.
- This is for you.

409
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,528
Thank you.
Thanks, I appreciate it.

410
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,101
Jesus.

411
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,032
Touchdown, Dolphins!

412
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,199
Yeah!

413
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,787
And that
was the moment I realized

414
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,457
I was glad Charlie McMillan was dead.

415
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,427
My dry-cleaner showed up?

416
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,472
Did not see that coming.
I love that guy.

417
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,974
Why don't you go down there
and freak him out?

418
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,602
Didn't expect to see you so quick.

419
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,271
You think I'd miss my killer's funeral?

420
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,398
There it is.
He's back.

421
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,609
- Can I take a look?
- Go ahead.

422
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,905
Who's this guy in the suit?

423
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,449
Is that George Michael?
I have no idea.

424
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,992
And what's this?

425
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,495
Is that your crazy ex-girlfriend?
Is she here, too?

426
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,462
What is she doing?

427
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,005
Come on.

428
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,591
Cut that shit.

429
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,262
Hey, buddy.
You know you didn't really die.

430
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,806
Why are you getting so worked up?

431
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,015
Oh.

432
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,975
Got a little too real for me for a minute.

433
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,230
All right, well, this is it.

434
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,191
So, what now, Butch Ryder?
You got me.

435
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,359
Well, we're free men.

436
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,611
We can do
whatever the fuck we want now.

437
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:51,031
Actually, I stumbled upon something
that might be worth investigating.

438
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,157
- Okay.
- See this key?

439
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,201
- Yeah.
- Pick it up.

440
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,619
Smell it.

441
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,496
Mmm.

442
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,747
Smells like shit.

443
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,999
'Cause I found it up Butch Ryder's ass.

444
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,215
Why would you be digging up
some dead guy's ass?

445
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,843
You'd be surprised how many people
hide stuff up their ass.

446
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,678
Important stuff.

447
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,221
Pick it up, one more time.

448
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,305
Here.

449
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,686
Just, uh... What do you think?
What could that open up?

450
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,023
This is a level 5-A security key.

451
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,151
How fucking smart are you?

452
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,403
Based on the tooth pattern,
I'd say it's foreign.

453
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,405
Number suggests a Latin country.

454
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,534
And the fact that it was
up some dead guy's butt...

455
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,619
I would say it's a safety deposit box key.

456
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:41,707
Charlie! How the fuck did you do that?
Could we find it?

457
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,625
May I?

458
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:48,338
As a manager of a bank,
I have access to a federal database.

459
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,923
Should be able to provide a match.

460
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,259
Let's go, baby.

461
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,556
What?

462
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,392
Oh, man.
Oh, man, this is it.

463
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:08,233
That looks nice.
Banco Nacional de Puerto Rico.

464
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,544
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

465
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,018
Oh, no. They might have a
biometric identification process.

466
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,436
That means we need fingerprints.

467
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,730
Wish you would have told me that
before I blew up the bodies.

468
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,065
I would have saved the hands.

469
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,508
Well, hopefully, they have what's known as
a "document-based identification process."

470
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,280
Just let me charm
the fucking skirt off this señorita.

471
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,204
It's nice to be back.

472
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,332
Assuming I've been here before...

473
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,876
which I would know, obviously.

474
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,881
Have we met?

475
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,634
No, I don't believe we have.

476
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,220
Right, 'cause you got
a very forgettable face.

477
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,783
You want people to remember you,
maybe get a personality, right?

478
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,686
You're not one of the Mario brothers,
are you?

479
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,229
Hey, since his ID is in order,

480
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,524
we'd like to be taken
to the safety deposit room immediately

481
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,234
and be given privacy,

482
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,404
which is our right
under the Banking Act of 1938.

483
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,241
Of course.

484
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,371
Oh, it fits.

485
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,833
- Shit.
- Oh... it's a big one.

486
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,669
- God!
- A little heavy for ya?

487
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,879
Um, I got it.

488
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,509
Whoa!

489
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,928
I always wanted one of these.
A tablet! Dibs!

490
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,722
Look at this!
All this money!

491
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,307
Dibs! Dibs! On the money!

492
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,935
Max, there's gotta be like a
million bucks in here! You're rich!

493
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,019
That's great!

494
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,772
Oh, and this.
What's this?

495
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:12,774
There's a note.

496
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,655
"Butch, here are the keys
to your secret hideaway,

497
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,326
where I know you'll find
the peace and quiet you're looking for.

498
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,704
I hope you enjoy many happy,
healthy years here.

499
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:30,417
You deserve it, you sexy bastard.
Love... Dakota."

500
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,629
Ooh, Dakota sounds hot.

501
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,382
Yeah. There's the key!

502
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:41,345
And it doesn't smell like shit.
I hope it has a good view!

503
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,853
- Ah!
- Jesus.

504
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,563
What?

505
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,232
Who lived here, Bill Gates?

506
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,984
Huge TV, definitely not my Zenith.

507
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,529
Full bar!

508
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,573
Oh, dude.

509
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,743
Puerto Rico!

510
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,664
There's, like, five houses in this house.

511
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,082
Another pool!

512
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,089
Place is gorgeous!

513
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,302
We're gonna have the best time here, bud.

514
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,306
Yeah!

515
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,980
- Don't tell me you hid more bodies?
- No.

516
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,524
I got dibs on the master suite.

517
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,902
- I got dibs on the Ferrari!
- Oh...

518
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:39,987
You dick.

519
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,800
Yeah. That's it?

520
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,844
No... Hey!

521
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,095
- Hey!
- Hey!

522
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:10,142
Hi, I wanted, real quick...
Just one second, if I could.

523
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:14,771
I'm Dr. Ronald P. Fishman.
Hola, everybody.

524
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:19,318
I'm an Aquarius and I have a red Ferrari
and I'm pretty sure I'm Jewish.

525
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:25,532
I moved here, just down the road,
into a massive beachfront mansion.

526
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,659
I just wanna tell you
that I'm gonna be getting drunk here

527
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,411
every night for the rest of my life.

528
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:34,583
The good news is, I'm buying your drinks
for the rest of your lives!

529
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,627
I just...

530
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,129
- Will you do... Yeah.
- I'll do it, I'll do it.

531
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,465
And play "Who Let The Dogs Out."

532
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,966
Who let the...

533
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,554
Are you out of your fucking mind, man?

534
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,723
What are you bringing
so much attention to us for?

535
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,476
No, I said I was Dr. Ronald Fishman.

536
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,186
And I'm the legendary Butch Ryder.

537
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,397
But don't you think maybe somebody here
might know those guys for real?

538
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,940
We don't even look like 'em.

539
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,609
What do they look like?

540
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:04,905
Oh, shit.

541
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,532
Oh, my God!

542
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,867
Oh, he's got tattoos.

543
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,453
You have to get
those exact same tattoos as Butch.

544
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,829
I do, do I?

545
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:16,083
If Dr. Fishman has tattoos,
I'd go get 'em.

546
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,836
He didn't have a tattoo,
but there's somethin' else that he had.

547
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,176
Oh, yeah! I'll get an earring,
I don't care.

548
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,844
You don't put this in your ear.

549
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,221
Where does it go?

550
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:39,022
Kickin' ass
and takin' names, baby!

551
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,485
Yeah!

552
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,834
Hmm...

553
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,919
Hmm... hmm...

554
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,093
No!

555
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,683
Want a Popsicle?

556
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,185
Do we have any cherry ones left?

557
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,562
Yeah, one more.

558
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,981
- Yes.
- Proud of you, man.

559
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,400
You earned my respect last night.
You're a tough guy.

560
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,653
You know, I wish
I did invent time travel.

561
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,780
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause I would go back to last night

562
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,116
and not put a hole in my tongue!

563
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,703
Jeez...
How many weird apps are here?

564
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,246
Jenga.

565
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,748
Why are you still
messing with that?

566
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,667
Yeah, you're a computer genius.

567
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,378
You think there's any place
they could have hid something on here?

568
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,714
You know, like, behind a firewall
or some shit?

569
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,383
It's not a computer.
It's a tablet.

570
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:53,263
There is no firewall. What's on there
that's hidden you need to find?

571
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,767
Some amateur porn?
Maybe Butch fuckin' Dakota?

572
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,811
If I'm gonna be Butch,
I gotta know all his moves.

573
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:03,732
Does he slap ass?
Is he a nipple flicker? Or...

574
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,943
does he whip out the dildo
and go to town with that?

575
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,028
Oh, that sounds like a party.

576
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,405
Hi, I hope I'm not intruding.

577
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,325
I'm Dawn DeFazio.
I'm your next door neighbor.

578
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,994
Oh, hey, Dawn.
I'm Butch Ryder.

579
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,247
This is my best friend, uh,
Dr. Ronald P. Fishman.

580
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,166
The P stands for "pussy pounder."

581
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,003
It's great to finally meet you.

582
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,255
I was starting to think
you were never gonna move in.

583
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,424
Yeah, the movers were here
about a month ago,

584
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,302
but they were so hush-hush
about who was movin' in here.

585
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,347
Like it was the president
or George Clooney or somethin'.

586
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,932
Ah, that's interesting.

587
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,684
I don't know what the big secret was.
It's just us.

588
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,977
What do you think?

589
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,479
You want a Corona?

590
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,773
I'd tell you to pull up a lounge chair,
but we don't got no more.

591
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,983
Maybe Dr. Ron'll
make you a little room.

592
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,110
Ooh. Oh, I would love to.

593
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,571
But actually, I'm running late
for my mani-pedi.

594
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:55,867
I gotta get all pretty for tonight.
Oh, you two should come with.

595
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,286
It's Rum Runner night at Club Oro.

596
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,638
- Lookin' sharp, by the way, big boy.
- Really?

597
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,766
You don't think this is too Magnum?

598
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,102
You could never go too Magnum.

599
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,728
Maybe lose the hat, though.

600
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,690
Ooh, hola, neighbors.

601
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:30,777
- Butch, Ronald, this is my co-pilot, Joan.
- Ah.

602
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,447
Dawn dragged me along to make sure she
doesn't do anything to embarrass herself.

603
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:35,824
Who's watching you, then?

604
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,492
- Oh, you're funny.
- Mmm-hmm.

605
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:41,454
Buenas noches. Welcome to
Rum Runner night here at Club Oro.

606
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,249
I'm Jorge, I'm gonna be your
shooter boy for the evening.

607
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,210
Jorge, nice to meet you.
Who's this crazy fuck over here?

608
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:50,380
Oh, he's, uh, shooter boy-in-training.

609
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,591
He's just watching, observing,
no need to worry.

610
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:53,842
How can I help you?

611
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,844
How about four Panty Droppers?

612
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,972
Oh, yeah!
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

613
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,599
- Whoo!
- Hey!

614
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,603
Jorge, I don't think it worked.

615
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,522
Maybe they're not wearing panties.

616
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,357
Guilty!

617
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,419
Wow!

618
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,631
- You boys can still bust a move, huh?
- Oh, yeah!

619
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,633
Not bad for a couple of old farts.

620
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,385
Please, I got you both beat.
How old are you?

621
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,763
I'll put it to you this way,
we're over the speed limit.

622
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,015
- No way! Y'all aren't 55.
- Mmm-mmm.

623
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,268
You're right, Joan.
This guy just had his 57th birthday.

624
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:50,148
Well, I've never been
afraid of doing over 55.

625
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,401
Easy, Dawn. You're gonna overheat.

626
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,654
We need to make a pit stop
in the little girls' room.

627
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,615
Don't flood your engines
in there, huh?

628
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,492
We got a long ride ahead of us.

629
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,496
Hey, wait, why are you telling 'em
that we're in our mid-'50s?

630
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,248
Whenever a chick asks me my age,
I always add ten years.

631
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,333
Why do you do that?

632
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,127
You tell them your real age,
they just shrug. No big deal.

633
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,463
Now, you're the fountain of fucking youth.

634
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,758
No wonder that chick stalks you.
Where did you learn to talk like this?

635
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,385
You ever been in a threesome?

636
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,764
I'm not guaranteeing anything, but,
uh, let's try to get that done for you.

637
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,641
Are you shitting me?

638
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,651
You gotta stop staring at me.

639
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,319
Oh, sorry.

640
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:42,492
You're still staring at me, man.
That's poor three-way etiquette.

641
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,953
All right, Jorge.
Come on, rookie mistake.

642
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,664
Why don't you let the doctor
get a turn in the cockpit, huh?

643
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,124
Rotate for a minute.

644
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,000
Okay, I'm cool.

645
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:54,170
I'm gonna go take a dookie.
I'll be back in two. Got it?

646
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,923
I'll just... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna chill here.

647
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:01,386
Taking notes?
Good man.

648
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,804
Hey, Dr. Ron, you know what?

649
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,097
Let me hop in the saddle.

650
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,349
My fuckin' arthritis
in my knees is killin' me.

651
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,226
- Oh, okay. That's fine.
- Yeah, okay.

652
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,479
This is not what
I had in mind when you said threesome!

653
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,898
It's not my fault Joan passed out.

654
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,400
But why shooter boy?

655
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,485
I don't know, you're the one
who loves staring at him.

656
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,570
Hey, Dawn.

657
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,321
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

658
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,449
The, uh, mover guys...

659
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,326
did they happen to give you
any information about us?

660
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,870
No.

661
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,997
But I play tennis
with your real estate lady

662
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,582
and she told me something.

663
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,042
But she said not to repeat it to anyone.

664
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,004
Oh, well, we're all getting close
here tonight, come on.

665
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,842
Well, she said that the buyers, you guys,
seemed to be in an awful hurry.

666
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,261
Like, maybe you were
on the run or somethin'.

667
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,554
"On the run"?

668
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,931
You bad boys.

669
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,770
- Oh! Oh, that's wonderful.
- Uh-huh.

670
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,230
- Oh, thank you.
- Ah...

671
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,066
You're welcome.

672
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,196
Snake delivery!

673
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,490
This the right address?

674
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,826
Oh, shit.
Who ordered that?

675
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,039
All right, Charlie.
Enjoy the view.

676
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:15,126
Yo, what's up with the AC?
I'm fuckin' sweating my balls off in here.

677
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,587
I'm sorry.

678
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,052
Oh! There's the sex machine.

679
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,054
Morning.

680
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,889
You must be hungry.

681
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,018
One or two sausages?

682
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,980
- One.
- Just the one. Okay.

683
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,542
Would it be better if there were two...

684
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,194
sweaty eggs underneath it?

685
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,488
Come on.

686
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,950
I gotta say, bud. You like it.
Right here, I'll just...

687
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,039
Can I get some food?

688
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,749
Last one...

689
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,547
Gotta be happy, though.
The tongue ring, Dawn dug it.

690
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,756
So did Jorge.

691
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,175
Can we not talk about last night again?
Ever?

692
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,301
All right.

693
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,136
Everything was in balance, though, man.

694
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,681
Dawn says that her husband
cheats on her all the time.

695
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,225
- Wait, she's married?
- Yeah, she's married.

696
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,853
Who do you think we're playing
golf with on Sunday?

697
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,522
Are you fucking with me?

698
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,148
No, we're playing golf with the guy.
I just...

699
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,776
That face you just made
reminded me of last night with the dick,

700
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,319
when it came out, you were like...

701
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,530
By the way,
I think that snake was a cobra,

702
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,740
because it had a hood and a flat head.

703
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,242
It was so gross.

704
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,036
You let that happen.

705
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,622
I gotta sit down.
I'm dizzy.

706
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,626
You don't feel good.
What do you got, a hangover?

707
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,711
Yes, the king is fucking hungover.

708
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,630
Wow.

709
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,467
Look at this.
You see that?

710
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,261
Butch has a picture with Dr. Fishman.

711
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,387
They knew each other.

712
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,473
Yeah, they got brought in together,
I assumed they were friends.

713
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,058
Well, who's the girl?
Is that Dakota?

714
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,269
No, Dakota's my dead guy's chick.

715
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,854
That's yours, buddy.

716
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,523
Your girlfriend or, uh...
look at the ring.

717
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,275
Your wife.

718
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,194
I'm married!
She's a babe.

719
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:08,406
Yeah, look at you
fallin' in love all over again.

720
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,241
Forgot about Jorge, did you?

721
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,125
Whoo!

722
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,427
Fuck.

723
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,398
Hey!

724
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,068
We got an underwater doorbell!

725
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,819
Butch Ryder knew how to live!

726
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,112
Fuck yeah, man.

727
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,824
All right, you swim.
It's probably Dawn, ready for round two.

728
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,202
Is that what the bell means, round two?

729
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,804
What the fuck is this?

730
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,309
Cheese...

731
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,853
lettuce...

732
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,648
Ah... No! Mustard.

733
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,819
Not too much.

734
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,071
Ooh!

735
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,866
Hey! I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, Fishman!

736
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,618
What? Well, who are you?

737
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,913
You know who the fuck I am!
And you know what you did!

738
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,206
No, I don't.

739
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,875
You tag-teamed my wife!

740
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,671
Yeah, she told me all about your...
your little snake delivery!

741
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,006
My snake delivery?

742
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,383
That wasn't me!
That was Jorge, the shooter boy!

743
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,427
- Get the fuck out of the pool. Get out!
- No, I can't.

744
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,679
- Get out of the fucking pool!
- It's not a good idea.

745
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,139
You're not gonna come out?

746
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,932
I'll come in there and break
your fucking skull.

747
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,100
No! No, listen.

748
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,269
Let's talk about this.
Let's have a beer together.

749
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:03,730
What the...

750
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,443
What the...

751
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,704
Ow!

752
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,301
And that's where the shit
really hit the fan.

753
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,804
I was about to die for real
and I was not ready for that.

754
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,766
Luckily, my friend Max was keeping
another secret from me...

755
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,311
Daddy's got you.

756
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,439
He was Action fucking Jackson.

757
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,669
Aren't you a little fucking tall
for gymnastics?

758
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:18,221
- Oh!
- Let's go. Run, Ron! Ron, run!

759
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,624
- Come on. Go. You're Ron.
- Yeah.

760
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,372
Yeah, our friend at the bank was correct.

761
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,708
Ryder and Fishman have
returned from the dead.

762
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,546
These two gentlemen have
taken over their identities.

763
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,388
Out of all the dead bodies in the world...
you pick the most wanted man in America?

764
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,099
Stop swiping!

765
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,977
How could you not have
researched these guys?

766
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,353
I researched them.

767
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:11,858
Dr. Ron's a very successful doctor
with an impeccable record,

768
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,193
who, unfortunately,
got two bullets to the head.

769
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,154
You said he died of natural causes!

770
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,739
You naturally die
if you get two bullets to the head!

771
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,324
Maybe I'm not good with words.

772
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:23,661
Who the hell are you, man?
And don't lie to me again!

773
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,496
Okay, stop freaking out.

774
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,249
You're right, I'm not a coroner.

775
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,917
I'm a fucking...

776
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,587
guidance counselor.

777
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,088
Shut the fuck up.

778
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,300
How could a guidance counselor
take on trained assassins?

779
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,010
I went to police academy.

780
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,471
I wanted to be a motorcycle cop.
I took it very serious.

781
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,974
I was number one in the class
in marksmanship.

782
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,097
Then why aren't you a cop?

783
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:49,187
- 'Cause I couldn't pop a fucking wheelie.
- You couldn't pop a wheelie?

784
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,356
And I didn't fare too well
on the psychological exam.

785
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,902
That I believe. Wow.

786
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,070
Now, where did you get these dead bodies?

787
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,406
I found them dead.

788
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,367
They were... gone.
I didn't kill 'em.

789
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,870
And you never thought, for once,
that maybe their family,

790
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,747
maybe their friends, a cop,

791
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,958
a ten-foot-tall assassin
might come lookin' for 'em?

792
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,795
No... but I guess that's why
I should've come clean before.

793
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,549
You always think shit through
better than I do.

794
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,427
What's our next move?
What do we do now?

795
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,888
What do we do? That's easy.
We turn ourselves in.

796
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,806
Okay.
I want to do that, too.

797
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,476
We're looking at 25 to 30 years,
but I can handle that.

798
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,853
No! No, you said it was five to ten.

799
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:34,523
That was before we stole all that money.
And we shot Dawn's husband.

800
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,108
You shot Dawn's husband!

801
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,611
I only shot him
because you tag-teamed his wife,

802
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,987
you fucking degenerate.

803
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,865
What do you think a Puerto Rican jury
is gonna say about that?

804
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,034
Oh, my God, we're screwed.

805
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,536
- God, I'm an idiot.
- No, no, no, no, no.

806
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,413
- We can get out of this.
- I'm so stupid.

807
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:53,459
All we gotta do is find out why these guys
wanna kill us and then we'll stop 'em.

808
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,045
They're involved with somethin'
fuckin' shady, right?

809
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,798
The mob or drugs or some shit,
I don't know.

810
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,466
- Yeah.
- You know who would know?

811
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,550
Who would know?

812
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,137
Dr. Ronald Fishman's wife...

813
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:08,057
who happens to be pretty hot, by the way.

814
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,352
So we decided to go back
to the States to talk to Mrs. Fishman.

815
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,856
As suicidal as it seemed to follow Max,
it was my only option.

816
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,234
And with no place to live
and no way to get around,

817
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,236
we found a way to combine the two.

818
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,325
We found the house easy enough

819
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,411
but we couldn't just go up
and knock on the door.

820
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,330
Our meeting with Mrs. Fishman
had to seem accidental.

821
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,006
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you like that, do you?

822
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,049
I know you like that.

823
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:45,094
'Cause you're my dirty,

824
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,513
crazy, sweet girl.

825
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,306
- Max?
- Oh!

826
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,809
What's up?

827
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,436
What are you doing?

828
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,438
What was I doing?

829
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,983
I, uh... was having some fun,
I guess, you know.

830
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,569
We all didn't get to play
Three Amigos the other night.

831
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,738
So, I was just looking for some relief.

832
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,324
You... Who were you talking to?

833
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:11,370
I was talking to a 1-800 number, uh,
"Dial-a-boner."

834
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,415
A girl talks dirty to you
while you fuck a doll.

835
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,251
It's five bucks a minute.
Good to be back in the States.

836
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,337
You say that like it's so normal.

837
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,090
Oh, there she is.
There she is.

838
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,300
Oh, shit.

839
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:28,929
Yeah.

840
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,474
Well, doc,
your wife has a very nice body.

841
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,975
What's the plan?

842
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,699
- Follow her. Just follow her.
- What? Yeah?

843
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,270
You can do this.
You can do this.

844
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,315
Go, go, go.
Don't let her get too far away.

845
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,034
What the fuck?

846
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,203
Oh, my God!

847
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,997
Oh, my God! Are you okay?
Are you all right?

848
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,041
Jesus, what the hell were you thinking?

849
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,210
That's why I bought you a phone book!

850
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,587
So you could see
over the fucking steering wheel!

851
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,214
Sit on it next time!

852
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,257
It's okay, sweetheart.
I'm an EMT.

853
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,135
Let me just make sure you're all right,
check your head.

854
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,720
What's your name, dear?

855
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,013
Heather Fishman.

856
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,641
And how many asshole drivers
can you see right now?

857
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,019
- One.
- Right on the money. Good.

858
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,021
So, can we get you back to your house?

859
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,731
- Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks.
- Yeah.

860
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:21,899
Oh!

861
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,484
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

862
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,570
I just wanna say,
even though I'm friends with him,

863
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:30,241
if you choose to sue him,
I will testify on your behalf.

864
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,408
Not a problem.

865
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,120
Aw, that's sweet of you,
but I don't think that'll be necessary.

866
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,704
- I'm pretty sure it's just a bruise.
- Yeah?

867
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,206
- Yeah.
- How about the ice?

868
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,415
- Let's get the ice.
- I know. I got it.

869
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,751
- Oh, you found the kitchen. Okay.
- Yeah, that's right.

870
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,419
All right, here you go.
I'm gonna...

871
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,838
- I'll put it right there.
- Okay.

872
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,798
I think if you elevate it
above your heart,

873
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,716
that's what's supposed to be good for it.

874
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,426
It's actually my other knee.

875
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,222
Okay, all right. So, lift that up.
And I'll put the ice like this.

876
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,974
What are you doing right now?

877
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,101
- Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
- Ow!

878
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,310
I'm sorry, I didn't...

879
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,312
- It's fine.
- Here. Here. Okay.

880
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:03,607
Don't be mad at him, he gets nervous
every time he likes somebody.

881
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,151
Whoops, did I say that?

882
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,737
Oh, you want us to get that for you?

883
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,407
- Oh, no, that's okay, I can handle it.
- But your knee...

884
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,741
You guys can leave, I'm fine.

885
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,451
- Honestly, guys, you can leave.
- Sure.

886
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:15,536
What do we do?

887
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,840
Mrs. Fishman, I'm so sorry.

888
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,341
I'm gonna have to get you out of here.

889
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:30,426
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

890
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,723
Whoa, whoa. Mrs. Fishman!

891
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,057
Wait! Wait! Wait! Please!

892
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,934
We're here to help you,
not hurt you, I promise.

893
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:41,061
We got off on the wrong foot.
My name is Charlie.

894
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,899
What the fuck?

895
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,902
Please, let me go!

896
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,123
Let me out!

897
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:02,291
- Let me out!
- Heather!

898
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,126
- Let me out!
- Calm down!

899
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,253
Calm down, we're the good guys,
I promise you.

900
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,755
- You have to trust us. Please.
- "Trust you"?

901
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,965
You kidnap me, and you hit me
with a Winnebago...

902
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,175
We did that for a reason!

903
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,636
- "A reason"?
- Listen to me, I have proof.

904
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,012
- We are not lying.
- You better show me proof!

905
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,306
Mrs. Fishman, this is your husband.

906
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,768
- Oh, my God!
- What are you doing?

907
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,977
She wanted proof!

908
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,855
A dead, naked picture of him
makes us look like the bad guys.

909
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,023
- Hey, I don't know.
- Don't you think?

910
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,025
Can you please pull over?
I can't breathe.

911
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,308
- It's so hot in here.
- I'll pull over! I'll pull over!

912
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,197
- She's upset.
- Yeah.

913
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,115
She's upset.

914
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,202
Do you think we could run to the doctor
for two seconds, I just feel like this...

915
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,955
We don't got time, buddy.
Just get over that.

916
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,748
So Ronnie's really gone?

917
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,918
Uh... yeah, I'm afraid so.

918
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,461
I have been looking for him.

919
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,422
I kept praying that he was safe, but...

920
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,508
deep down,
I knew something bad had happened.

921
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,344
We are so sorry for your loss.

922
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,764
If it's any consolation,
your husband went quickly and peacefully.

923
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,849
Just...

924
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,101
two shots to the skull,

925
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,561
- right through there, then...
- out the end.

926
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:05,646
Oh, my God!

927
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,731
What he says is...

928
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:11,652
He's saying that we're very sorry,
but we also have one more problem.

929
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,738
You see, there are some people out there
that think I'm your husband,

930
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,615
- and they're trying to kill me.
- Right.

931
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,158
Why do they think you're Ronnie?

932
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:21,578
Well, he stole your husband's ID
and started impersonating him.

933
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,290
He's also wearing his clothes
like a fucking weirdo.

934
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:27,126
We figure the same people
that are trying to kill us...

935
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,377
are the ones who shot your husband.

936
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,754
"Us"? And who are you pretending to be?

937
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,798
The legendary Butch Ryder.

938
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,425
Butch Ryder?

939
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,968
- You know him?
- Yeah.

940
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,136
Yeah.

941
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,848
We found pictures of you and your husband
on Butch's tablet.

942
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,100
Was he a patient of his or something?

943
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:47,730
No, Ronnie didn't practice anymore.
He ran a pharmaceutical research firm.

944
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:50,733
Butch was his friend.
They used to ride motorcycles together.

945
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,860
He... he said he was a fun guy.

946
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:56,488
Fun enough to land himself on the FBI's
Most Wanted list.

947
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,656
- What?
- Yeah.

948
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,617
- Oh, my God.
- Both of their bodies were found together.

949
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:04,371
We think maybe Butch got your husband
tangled into some trouble.

950
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:09,168
Well, I guess that would make sense
why our house was broken into last week.

951
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,836
Did they take anything?

952
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,839
Oh, that was the weird part,
they just tore apart Ronnie's study.

953
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,800
I bet they were looking for something.

954
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,677
Astonishing work there, Nancy Drew.

955
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:22,514
Anyways, did he ever come to your house?
Did he possibly hide something there?

956
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:23,640
No.

957
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,934
Ronnie would always meet him
at some biker bar,

958
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,395
this place, um, off of Route 80.

959
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,813
Bing-bang, let's roll.

960
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:32,524
- Okay. Hey, come on. Come with us.
- I'm going there?

961
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:48,040
I can't believe
Ronnie used to come to this place.

962
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,124
Yes, shocking.

963
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,210
So, you gonna make a move on that,
or am I gonna do it?

964
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,921
Jeez, her husband just died.
She's mourning, for Christ's sake.

965
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,673
Yeah, then she needs
a nice dick to cry on.

966
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,888
Hey... Encino Man, how are you?

967
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:06,433
I was wondering if you happen
to know a badass...

968
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,520
by the name of Butch Ryder?

969
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:13,565
Yeah, I know Butch, and I'll tell you
the same thing I told the cops,

970
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,067
I ain't seen him in months.

971
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,403
Now, order some drinks or get out.

972
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,572
Three Jamesons.

973
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,743
Hope you're proud of yourself,
killing that tiny elephant

974
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:27,371
and putting his tusk in your nose.
Real tough.

975
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,457
Here's to new friends.

976
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,585
- To Ronnie.
- Yeah. Yeah, him, too.

977
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,298
Good God.
Jameson, man.

978
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,717
Every time,
it reminds me of my 55th birthday party.

979
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,220
Remember that night?
Wasn't that the best?

980
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,681
- Come on. You're 55?
- Can you believe that?

981
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:50,853
I'm actually gonna be 57 next week.
Where does time go?

982
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,439
Wow, you look amazing.

983
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,065
Well, I eat a lot of fruit.

984
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,484
Peaches are my favorite.

985
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:01,029
I can eat a peach for about two,
three hours.

986
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,115
Mmm...

987
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,410
You think he's old... I'm 66.

988
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,412
Yeah, I can see that.

989
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,331
- Seventy?
- Hey.

990
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,959
It's not The Price Is Right.
We'll be right back.

991
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,711
Gonna talk to him for a sec.

992
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,379
What the hell are you doing?

993
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,423
Chicks don't wanna fuck senior citizens.

994
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,717
Senior citizens don't wanna
fuck senior citizens.

995
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,636
Look at her, she's so far
out of my league, I can't think.

996
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,681
But she's grieving,
which makes her vulnerable,

997
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,099
which means you have a shot.

998
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:32,603
Now, first time you feel like
there's a moment, seize it.

999
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,896
Look her in the eyes,

1000
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,106
grab the back of her neck,

1001
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,941
say nothing...

1002
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,652
and then fuck her in the mouth
with your tongue.

1003
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,946
- You're a psycho.
- Fuck you.

1004
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,532
So Benjamin Button here is gonna
buy you another drink.

1005
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,076
I'm gonna go look for a canary
and make him sing.

1006
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,582
Hey, Bamm-Bamm,
can we get two more, man?

1007
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,585
All right.

1008
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,962
Let's look at your hand, Grandpa.

1009
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,089
I used to be a nurse.
That's how I met Ronnie.

1010
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:04,551
What's the prognosis?
You think you can... save it?

1011
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,636
Let's see.

1012
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,473
- To numbing the pain?
- Sure.

1013
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,480
That is for hitting me with the Winnebago.

1014
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,194
Hey, gentlemen?
Anybody using this chair?

1015
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,112
- It's yours.
- Thanks.

1016
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,867
What kind of hogs you riding nowadays?

1017
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:32,120
I've still got my...
Whoa!

1018
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:34,790
Where the hell is Butch?
What did you do with him?

1019
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,709
He's at the bottom of the ocean.
Let me show you a picture.

1020
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,628
- You killed him!
- No, no, no! He didn't kill him!

1021
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,380
We're trying to find the guys who did.

1022
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:45,884
Then why is this sick bastard
wearing Butch's tats and jewelry?

1023
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,886
Because he's a sick bastard,
but he's telling you the truth.

1024
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,610
He didn't kill Butch and he didn't
kill my husband, Ronnie, either.

1025
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,599
You're Mrs. Fishman?

1026
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:53,809
Yes.

1027
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:55,978
Fuck!

1028
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,648
Butch was diagnosed
with stage-four cancer.

1029
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,775
He was given six months to live.

1030
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,236
So that's how they met.

1031
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,947
Ronnie was working
on some promising cancer treatments.

1032
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,490
More than promising.

1033
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:11,410
Butch told me Ronnie developed
a magic bullet.

1034
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,662
It was a treatment
that used an MRI machine

1035
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:17,082
to target the bad cells
and not kill the good ones.

1036
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,084
I had no idea they had gotten that far.

1037
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:23,714
Well, they were conducting some secret,
non-FDA approved clinical trials.

1038
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,049
Butch and some other guys
were the guinea pigs.

1039
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:29,094
- And it was working?
- Bet your ass it was working.

1040
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:32,347
Guys were getting better,
no fucking side effects.

1041
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:35,350
When Ronnie had to shut down the program,
they both were devastated.

1042
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,434
Which leads me to ask,

1043
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,771
why the fuck would they close down
a program that was working?

1044
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:44,860
Money. Ronnie's partner, Shecky,
Arthur Sheck, he was the money guy.

1045
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,063
He called up one day,
suddenly the funds had dried up,

1046
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,406
and they had to cancel
all these research programs.

1047
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,576
- That must have been one of 'em.
- Yes, ma'am, it was.

1048
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,912
Until Butch and your husband
took matters into their own hands.

1049
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:58,915
- What does that mean?
- It means Butch started knocking off banks

1050
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,126
to have enough money
to continue the treatments.

1051
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,294
Holy shit.

1052
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:06,381
When he got that pretty little face of his
on the FBI's Most Wanted List...

1053
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:11,678
they sent me down to Puerto Rico
to set up their secret hideaway.

1054
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:14,765
But I guess they... never made it there.

1055
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:16,892
Wait a minute.

1056
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:18,977
You're Dakota?

1057
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,729
Yeah.

1058
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,065
"Dakota sounds hot."

1059
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,316
Oh, fuck you.

1060
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,568
Sounds like you and Butch
were pretty close.

1061
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:30,739
He knew me like no other man
had ever known me before.

1062
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,241
Tough, but tender.

1063
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:34,743
What's this now?

1064
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,622
We were fuck buddies for years.

1065
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:42,542
Until Dr. Ronnie came along
and stole his heart away.

1066
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,086
No disrespect.

1067
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,714
Oh, shit, you didn't know?

1068
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:53,178
Oh, sugar... I am so, so sorry.

1069
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,264
- This explains a lot.
- The thing is,

1070
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:58,350
Dr. Ronnie and Butch were killed

1071
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,894
not because they were
in love with each other,

1072
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:04,815
or knockin' off banks...
because they were trying to cure cancer.

1073
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,318
Which is fucking disgraceful.

1074
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,154
This gets me so goddamn upset.

1075
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,785
That brings back some nice memories.

1076
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,290
You know, I gotta give you credit.

1077
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:25,002
You rock that jewelry real well.

1078
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:28,130
You know, that's how we met.
I'm a jewelry designer.

1079
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:31,299
- Oh.
- And Butch, that boy loved his bling.

1080
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:32,426
Oh, yeah?

1081
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:36,221
Did you make Dr. Ronald's
tongue ring, too?

1082
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,597
I like it, it's fun.

1083
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,808
Yeah, that's one of mine.

1084
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,310
But... that ain't a tongue ring.

1085
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:43,603
That's a cock stud.

1086
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,606
What? What?

1087
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,153
I can't believe you let me put
a cock stud in my mouth!

1088
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,697
I can't believe my husband had
a cock stud in his cock.

1089
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,115
Yeah, that's worse.
Come on, that's worse.

1090
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,491
Don't be a baby.

1091
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,660
- And Max...
- Yeah.

1092
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:03,331
If you need some place to lay low...
you can always shack up with me, baby boy.

1093
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:06,001
Yeah, that's very sweet of you, Dakota.

1094
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,588
I just don't know how safe
that would be for me or you.

1095
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:17,012
I know you wanna kiss me...
but I'm not your Butch.

1096
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,638
I'll never be Butch.

1097
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:23,351
What I can do is give you a mental image
to go enjoy yourself later with.

1098
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,567
You're a bad boy.

1099
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,237
Oh, choke on it, baby, choke me.

1100
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,114
Is this your friend?

1101
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,286
Ooh... Oh, yeah.

1102
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,916
Did he just cum in his pants?

1103
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,171
The Gymnast.

1104
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,298
No!

1105
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,597
- What are you doing? Go that way!
- Donuts!

1106
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,226
Where am I?

1107
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,144
You cannot find me?

1108
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,858
I ain't afraid of you,
I ain't afraid of fucking nothing!

1109
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,909
You don't kill me. I kill you.

1110
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:33,505
And the Russian judges give that
a what-the-fuck-just-happened-there?

1111
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,633
I can't believe that guy found us!

1112
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,260
What do we do?
We gotta hide out somewhere.

1113
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,095
My mother's summer cottage.

1114
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,418
- Your mother's cottage?
- Yeah.

1115
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,639
You don't wanna drag her into all this.

1116
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,808
It's all right.
She's senile as hell now.

1117
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,018
She sat on the toilet
the other day for six hours

1118
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,312
thinking she was on a bus to Disney World.

1119
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:52,774
They could torture the shit out of her.
She wouldn't cough up a word.

1120
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,245
Not many houses on this island.

1121
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,956
Oh, yeah, we're secluded.
No one's gonna find us here.

1122
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,166
Hey, check this out.

1123
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:12,210
- That old YZinger? You have that still?
- Yeah!

1124
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,920
You were a mad man on that.

1125
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,840
I could never pop a wheelie,
but guess who got me that thing?

1126
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,176
- Who?
- Your dad.

1127
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,928
- My dad?
- Your dad, after my father died.

1128
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,890
He did stuff like that all the time
for me, I'll never forget that.

1129
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,975
Just looked out for me
when I was growing up.

1130
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,226
Sounds like a good man.

1131
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,394
- The best.
- If he's such a good man,

1132
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,604
why didn't he give me one?

1133
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,063
Well, look at you.

1134
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:35,567
You were good at reading.
Just stick with that. Come on.

1135
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,527
"Look at you."
That's the only answer you have.

1136
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,280
My mother is gonna be psyched to see you.

1137
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,240
How senile is your mom?
Will she remember me?

1138
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:44,044
Of course,
she talks about you all the time.

1139
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,535
- Oh!
- Mom!

1140
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,120
Mom! What are you doing?

1141
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:49,039
The fridge! The fridge!

1142
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:53,293
Come on, the pizza guy, the president,
the mailman, the gardener, the me!

1143
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,380
I called you on the phone, remember?
That's why you set dinner up for us.

1144
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:01,009
Oh!
Max!

1145
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,219
Ah, there you go.
Oh, a jump.

1146
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,679
I love you.

1147
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,139
Look who's here.

1148
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,143
Sonny Bono and Donna Summer!

1149
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:14,231
What hurt more?
The frying pan or the Sonny Bono thing?

1150
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:17,108
It's all pretty bad today.

1151
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,321
I still can't believe it.

1152
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:25,158
My Maxi's best friend,
little Charlie McMillan.

1153
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:29,537
You know, after all these years,
he never stopped talking about you.

1154
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,748
- How you're so successful.
- Mmm-hmm.

1155
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:36,711
Became the big branch manager
of Save & Pay Supermarkets.

1156
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,339
You got a good memory, Mom.

1157
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:44,010
I hear you married the prom queen.
What was that whore's name again?

1158
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,304
Uh, Nikki.

1159
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,306
And we're not married anymore,
Mrs. Kessler.

1160
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,766
She wasn't very nice to me.

1161
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:54,729
Good, I hope you didn't catch
any sores from her filthy...

1162
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,439
you know...

1163
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:57,607
vagina.

1164
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,442
Oh...

1165
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,736
No, there was none of...
That wasn't the reason.

1166
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,657
Hey, who's that cute kid on the fridge?

1167
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,245
Little Maxi. Isn't he gorgeous?
He's coming to see me next week.

1168
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:15,667
What the hell are you talking about?
Visit you next week? That's me, Ma.

1169
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,794
You're Little Maxi?

1170
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,337
No, I'm Big Maxi!

1171
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:22,424
You remember the Save & Pay job,
but you don't remember I grew up?

1172
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:26,511
Uh... I remember you loved
that little Jimmie Walker T-shirt.

1173
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,431
See, I love how he remembers
this stuff and... and you...

1174
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:34,185
I just wish you showed up at my funeral.
Maybe, uh, that's what's bothering me.

1175
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:35,478
You're a ghost?

1176
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,566
Oh, I'm so confused.

1177
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,776
It's not you, I'm sorry.

1178
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:46,072
Don't be upset. I love you.
I know, you're just old... and crazy.

1179
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:50,160
Hey, one thing you shouldn't
be confused about...

1180
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,078
I don't work at Save & Pay.

1181
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,207
I work... I work in the bank inside of...
I'm a bank manager.

1182
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,418
Hey, guys, I just got
off the phone with Shecky.

1183
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:02,213
He has no idea Ronald's dead.
I didn't have the heart to tell him.

1184
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:04,215
Or he's pretending he has no idea.

1185
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,428
Everybody be cool.
It's probably just the fuse box.

1186
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,721
Happens all the time.

1187
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,431
I don't know,
somebody could be out there, Max.

1188
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,932
Ma, where's my bag?

1189
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:15,018
- I don't remember.
- Yeah, that's a shock.

1190
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,270
Found it.

1191
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,938
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1192
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,690
You know, I'm the kind of guy

1193
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,692
who always carries
a rubber in my wallet...

1194
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:25,612
...and an umbrella in my trunk.

1195
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,073
'Cause you never know
when you're gonna fuck in the rain.

1196
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:29,282
Max!

1197
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:31,993
Ma, you know you fucked in the rain.
Relax.

1198
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:34,204
That's true.
And the snow.

1199
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,914
- Yeah!
- Max, wait.

1200
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,540
You don't know if it's safe out there.

1201
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,125
Yeah? For who?

1202
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,977
Yep, it's the fuse box!

1203
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,859
Holy fuck!

1204
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,865
Stupid, selfish, son of a bitch!

1205
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:14,786
- Whoa!
- I am so tired of these games!

1206
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,329
I know you are!

1207
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,165
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

1208
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,126
I can't do it.
You need to come back to me.

1209
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,420
I need you.
You need me.

1210
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:26,089
Oh! Who's this sexy bitch?

1211
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,674
I'm his mother.

1212
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,844
Not you, Ma.
Becca, it's not what you think.

1213
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,846
Oh, no, of course not.

1214
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,933
Because your mother knows
the world of pain that I'm in right now.

1215
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,185
Would you just please
put the gun down so we can talk?

1216
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,270
I can't believe...

1217
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,440
I just cannot believe that this is how
you would want to end everything.

1218
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:47,986
- I just wanna talk to you.
- Listen, you're sick, Max.

1219
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,655
- You're sick.
- I know, I'm sorry.

1220
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,532
I just don't understand.

1221
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,786
Why wouldn't you want to spend
every last minute with me?

1222
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,914
I'm your family.
I'm your family.

1223
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:01,749
- I know.
- You don't know!

1224
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,961
- All right!
- You have no fucking idea!

1225
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,713
We'll give you guys
some privacy.

1226
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,882
- Get a hold of yourself.
- I'll take this, too.

1227
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,759
You gotta just walk away.
Just say goodbye.

1228
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,636
Just say goodbye.
That's it.

1229
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,515
All right.
Say goodbye to this.

1230
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,310
You gotta go! Go!

1231
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,644
I'm going!

1232
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:22,812
Then go!

1233
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,981
- Shut the door.
- Get over here. Get over here.

1234
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,195
They are fucking crazy.

1235
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,114
Ma! Ma, get the fuck out of here!

1236
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,328
It's so fucking hot

1237
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,371
how you tracked me down, woman.

1238
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:43,625
I would follow you
to the pits of hell, you fucker!

1239
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:47,045
Yeah, well, I'm smelling
your pits as I fuck you silly.

1240
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,088
Oh, that got me!

1241
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,925
Oh, I'm coming!
Oh, smell my feet.

1242
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:56,971
Whoo!

1243
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,474
I wish I was senile now.

1244
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,184
Can I ask you a question?

1245
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,435
Yeah, sure.

1246
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:06,231
What was so terrible about your life
that you wanted a whole new one?

1247
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,607
Oh...

1248
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,986
Well, for starters,
it kind of wasn't my choice.

1249
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,113
I got forced into it.

1250
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:17,367
But... it is nice to have
another opportunity

1251
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,786
to try to become the person
that I should have been.

1252
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,579
And who's that?

1253
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,374
I haven't figured that part out yet.

1254
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,045
Well... we should probably
get some shut-eye.

1255
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:32,465
Uh... why don't you take the bed
and I'll... I'll take the couch.

1256
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:36,177
Actually, I would feel much safer
if you slept in here with me.

1257
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,846
Um...

1258
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,807
Do you mean share this bed?

1259
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,977
No. I mean, you take the floor,
I take the bed.

1260
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,396
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Of course.

1261
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,147
Oh, Charlie, I'm kidding.

1262
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:49,983
Come on, we're adults.

1263
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,235
I think we can share the bed
for one night.

1264
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,071
- Really?
- Okay.

1265
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:02,412
Well, you don't have to worry about me,

1266
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,707
because I stayed in the same bed
with my ex-wife for... four years

1267
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,126
and I don't think we touched toes once.

1268
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,420
You know,
you forget who you're talking to.

1269
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:14,340
My husband had a stud in his thingy
and I never even knew.

1270
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,425
The truth is,

1271
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,886
I could have a telephone pole through
my dick and she would never have known.

1272
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,724
You're funny, Charlie.

1273
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,809
You're a funny, nice guy.

1274
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,918
Hey, where'd Becca go?

1275
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,171
Oh, I broke up with her again.
She's psychotic.

1276
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,840
How'd it go with you and this chick?
You take my advice?

1277
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:56,966
Yeah, it went okay.

1278
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,802
What? You kidding me?

1279
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:02,972
Dr. Ron's corpse is not even cold yet
and you're fucking his widow?

1280
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:04,182
Are you an asshole?

1281
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,768
No... No, you said it was okay.
Are you...

1282
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,728
It is okay, I'm fucking with you, brother.

1283
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,355
Look how happy you made her.

1284
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,318
Welcome to Old Willow.

1285
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,071
- Heather, Heather, Heather.
- Aw! It's so good to see you.

1286
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,947
Come on in, gentlemen.
Come on.

1287
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,699
I just made some sweet tea.

1288
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:28,414
Ronald's dead.
I can't believe it.

1289
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,667
Believe it now, Shecky?

1290
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,293
Oh! Oh!

1291
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:35,296
- Max, enough with the pictures.
- He said he didn't believe it.

1292
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,467
- I believed it. I'm just in disbelief.
- Oh, okay.

1293
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:42,929
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's been an emotional week.

1294
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,016
I lost my mama on Monday.

1295
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:52,605
And then I found out
all the medical supplies I donated

1296
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,732
to the Burmese drought victims...

1297
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,609
were stolen by the rebels.

1298
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:01,364
The soup kitchen I volunteer at...
burned down.

1299
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:06,953
Whole city smelled like...
ashes and Campbell's Chunky.

1300
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,707
Sweet kicks, though.

1301
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,083
- Huh?
- Where'd you get 'em?

1302
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,002
I know a guy at Nike.

1303
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:17,755
Shit, I wish I had a pair that nice,
but...

1304
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,924
I don't know a guy at Nike.

1305
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:23,052
Heather, how do you know
these fellas, again?

1306
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,137
They're new friends.

1307
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,055
They're just trying to help me
figure it all out.

1308
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:28,141
Yeah, Shecky, I mean, do you have
any files we can look at?

1309
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,600
Anything that would help us?

1310
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:33,855
My house got broken into and they stole
my laptop and my cell phone.

1311
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:38,735
So you had a formula that actually works
on cancer and you lost it.

1312
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:41,112
I never had any formula.
That was Ronald's department.

1313
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,822
I just handled the money.

1314
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:46,159
You handled it so well
that they couldn't finish the testing.

1315
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:49,495
Those drugs were working, Shecky.

1316
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,706
Is this a fucking joke to you?

1317
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,583
It wasn't my fault, I swear!

1318
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,835
The bank called in all our loans
out of nowhere,

1319
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,003
didn't give us a reason.

1320
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,046
I went everywhere for financing.
I swear.

1321
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,132
I even tried to mortgage Old Willow.

1322
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,801
Nobody would sit down with Shecky.
Nobody!

1323
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,846
I hope you don't think
I had something to do with this.

1324
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:11,893
I felt horrible when I let Ronald down.

1325
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,521
He was my best friend.

1326
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,609
We should go back there right now,

1327
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,861
torture the fuck out of him
till he tells the truth.

1328
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,988
We get it, you don't like the guy,
but here's the good news.

1329
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:26,073
We know what the guys
with the guns want now.

1330
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:27,158
Yeah, the formula.

1331
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,327
That's why they must have
broken into my house.

1332
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,745
Do you think it could be there?

1333
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,413
I don't know, it could be anywhere.

1334
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:34,957
Clearly, Ronnie was
a master at hiding things.

1335
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,460
- I should know.
- Uh-oh.

1336
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,129
Jesus!

1337
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:43,090
This mummy-looking-motherfucker's
like a human tracking device.

1338
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:44,258
- What do we do?
- You know what?

1339
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:45,968
Why don't you buckle up there,
Mrs. Fishman?

1340
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,220
Oh, God, no.

1341
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,682
Hey, dude, I'm lost.

1342
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:54,435
Can you tell me where
the side of the road is?

1343
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,647
Oh, my God.

1344
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:08,282
Hey, a little dizzy?
Get up.

1345
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:10,993
Come on, get up!

1346
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:12,161
Who are you?

1347
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,412
Who the fuck are you?

1348
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,122
Why are you following me?

1349
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,750
Uh... Um... American...

1350
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,877
American what?
Pharmaceuticals?

1351
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:21,796
American Girl doll? What?

1352
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:25,132
American... Express...

1353
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,759
Fraud Department.

1354
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,178
What?

1355
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,597
- You're Max Kessler, right?
- Yeah!

1356
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,517
You owe us $62,000.

1357
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,103
Watch it. Watch it.
Slow.

1358
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,816
Fuck, that's my old address, too.

1359
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,609
You're good.

1360
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,069
This guy's fucking good.

1361
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,113
All right.

1362
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,657
- Come on. I'm sorry, asshole.
- Ow!

1363
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,200
Okay, bub.

1364
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,494
There's 150 grand in here.

1365
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:55,496
That's over double what I owe Amex.

1366
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,790
So just take the rest,
pay for your medical bills.

1367
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:01,294
Fuckin' buy a suit,
maybe a 3D flat screen.

1368
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,962
Fuck, take it all, move to Maui.

1369
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,756
You know Hawaiian chicks
love to fuck guys with red beards.

1370
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,508
I made that up, nobody does.

1371
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,137
Look, we're in
a Rubik's Cube of shit right now,

1372
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,598
and it's up to me to make
all the right moves.

1373
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:17,643
Walking you inside that crowded hospital
ain't one of 'em.

1374
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:20,688
So is our business concluded... Robert?

1375
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,944
You're a hell of a bloodhound,
you know that?

1376
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,488
Put some Bactine on that shit,
it'll get better.

1377
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,583
Oh!

1378
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:48,925
With nowhere else to go,
we went back to the scene of the crime.

1379
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:52,219
Maybe Dr. Ron's laboratory
still had some secrets.

1380
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,513
These files are all messed up
and out of order.

1381
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:57,308
Listen, I think I can decode the password
for these encrypted files.

1382
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:00,102
- You can hack?
- We call it forensic data recovery.

1383
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:02,480
But yeah, at the bank,
when someone defaults,

1384
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,774
we have the legal right to access
their systems and ledgers

1385
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,192
to find any hidden assets.

1386
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,568
But they were working under the radar.

1387
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,488
Well, if they have employees,
which it looks like they did,

1388
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,740
I can access it through
the payroll service.

1389
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,284
That's impressive.

1390
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:19,121
Well, in my old life, I did have
a lot of free time on my hands.

1391
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:20,873
Boom! Check it out.

1392
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:21,958
Photos of your husband.

1393
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:24,543
Photos of Butch.
There's my tongue ring... Oh!

1394
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:25,907
Don't look at that. I'm sorry.

1395
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,630
I shouldn't have said that.
No, no, no.

1396
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:30,341
Kojak to Columbo.
No suspicious activity out here.

1397
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:33,052
- Find anything?
- Negative, Kojak, we're still looking.

1398
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,138
Hurry the fuck up, Charlie.
We gotta find that formula.

1399
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,599
Listen, we're gonna find it,
we're gonna give it to these Nazis,

1400
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,267
and then this nightmare will be over.

1401
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:41,352
What are you talking about?

1402
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:44,814
You wanna give the cure to cancer
to these fucking criminals?

1403
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,899
There is no cure for cancer!

1404
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,777
We'll give them the treatment
and we'll get back to our fake lives.

1405
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,696
I kind of like
the way mine is going now.

1406
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:55,116
Are you out of your fucking mind, Charlie?
You're just gonna lay down?

1407
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:59,036
Isn't that what got you a job at fucking
Save & Pay, being a pussy?

1408
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,249
And you're some expert oncologist?
No, you're a guidance counselor.

1409
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,252
You're good at telling dumb kids
they might get into junior college.

1410
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,922
Is this about the money?
Are you trying to get rich off this?

1411
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,883
You know what, Charlie, you're a dick.

1412
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:14,885
Max, I'm sorry.

1413
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:18,472
Listen, I'm just trying to think
of a way out of this, all right?

1414
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,433
Max?

1415
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,852
Max? Max?

1416
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,270
Shit.

1417
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:27,231
You know, he's right about
not giving them the formula.

1418
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:29,316
But none of that matters
if we don't find it.

1419
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,152
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna go look for Max.

1420
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,862
You stay here and search for it.

1421
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,822
And by the way...

1422
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:37,533
I like the way my life is going, too.

1423
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,915
Yeah.

1424
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,255
All right, let's do it.

1425
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:54,800
What do we got here?

1426
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,663
Life's short, Charlie.

1427
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:26,999
- You know you're not really dead, right?
- No...

1428
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,876
I just got caught up in the moment.

1429
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,753
Holy shit, I gotta sit down.

1430
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,756
You don't feel good.
What do you got, a hangover?

1431
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:40,930
I just cannot believe that this is how

1432
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,431
- you would want to end everything.
- Stop.

1433
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,058
You're sick, Max!

1434
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,726
I'm your family.

1435
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,895
- I'm sorry.
- I'm your family.

1436
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:57,113
That's Little Maxi.
Isn't he gorgeous?

1437
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:00,699
I wouldn't wish that on anybody.
Growing up without a dad.

1438
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,996
It's not a cure for cancer.

1439
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,416
It's a cure for Max's cancer.

1440
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,924
Cute kids.

1441
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:20,594
They're supposed to be with my ex tonight.
Said she was sick.

1442
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:23,931
Probably got backstage passes to Slipknot.

1443
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,517
That's the tough thing about divorce.

1444
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,727
Gotta watch your dumb kids alone...

1445
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:34,275
no sleep, while your ex is waking up
with 22-year-old bartenders,

1446
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:37,862
and who is footin' the bill for breakfast
and their herpes medicine?

1447
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:38,988
I am.

1448
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:43,617
Question, the, uh, thing with the, uh,
metal clamps, that, um...

1449
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:45,828
I'm looking for, uh...

1450
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:49,290
Joe Pesci used it in Casino to,
you know, crush the guy's head?

1451
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,292
- You mean a vise?
- Yeah, sweetheart, that...

1452
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,918
That's... A vise.

1453
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,795
We just carry auto parts.

1454
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,006
Try the hardware store.

1455
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:23,324
...the young cuckoo
will go so far as to fake injury,

1456
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,826
prompting the adult jay

1457
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:30,206
to carry the cuckoo along
the migratory route to eastern Africa.

1458
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,166
Only to fly back to...

1459
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:33,792
Hello, Shecky.

1460
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:39,798
You see... I'm not buyin' the whole
cry routine, Shecky.

1461
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:41,675
Tell me where the formula is.

1462
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:42,968
I need an ambulance.

1463
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,513
Where the fuck is the formula?

1464
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:48,933
Truly, I don't know.

1465
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,436
Oh! Sweet Jesus!

1466
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:55,189
Okay, I'm gonna have
to amp it up a little, aren't I?

1467
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:59,193
I am going to put your head
inside a fucking...

1468
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:02,279
What the fuck is the name of that thing,
with the clamp thing...

1469
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,697
- A vise?
- A vise!

1470
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:06,909
Yes, a vise, bitch!
Why do I keep forgetting that?

1471
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,787
Come here.

1472
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,415
What's...
What's happening?

1473
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:16,627
You are gonna tell me why you're lying,

1474
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,755
or I am gonna squeeze your head so hard,

1475
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,841
that that fucking mustache
is gonna pop off your head.

1476
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,343
What is that?

1477
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:27,471
You've been shot!
You've been shot!

1478
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:29,223
You were right.

1479
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:31,308
I was lying...

1480
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:33,519
because I thought you were one of them.

1481
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,728
I was one of them?

1482
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,230
I thought you were one of them!

1483
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:38,857
No. I'm a good guy.

1484
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,443
Why would you pull the funding
if you're such a good guy?

1485
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:46,448
They was gonna kill us
if we didn't stop the trials.

1486
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,409
Stay with me, Shecky!
Stay with me.

1487
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:49,535
Come on.

1488
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,412
You're all right.
You're all right.

1489
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:52,496
Oh, God.

1490
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:54,415
Who's "they," Shecky?

1491
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:59,878
Trojgaard are the world's largest
chemotherapy company.

1492
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:03,090
- Trojgaard.
- Ronald didn't wanna sell 'em the drug,

1493
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:06,802
because he knew they would bury it.

1494
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,554
Why would they bury it?

1495
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,598
A drug like that would be
worth billions of dollars.

1496
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:14,184
A drug that replaces chemo...

1497
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:17,229
would ultimately cost them...

1498
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,647
trillions.

1499
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,916
- Wait.
- What?

1500
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,879
Make sure all my money
goes to cancer research.

1501
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:42,963
Yeah.

1502
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,426
You can... have my Nikes.

1503
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,555
I know you had your eyes on them.

1504
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:58,062
You really are a good guy.

1505
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,231
Tell Mama I'm comin'.

1506
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,027
Shecky. Shecky!

1507
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,071
I forgot to ask you, who killed you?

1508
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,615
Shecky!

1509
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,742
Who did this to you?

1510
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:13,410
I think I have a clue.

1511
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:19,958
Please open up, it's Charlie McMillan.
I need to talk to you.

1512
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,507
Please, it's about Max.
I think he's in trouble.

1513
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,180
Wow.

1514
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:36,433
Look at all these fun toys
we have to play with.

1515
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,435
I'm a bit of a handyman.

1516
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:40,270
If you untie me, uh...

1517
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:42,231
I could show you how to use that shit.

1518
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:45,859
I think I can figure it out myself.

1519
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,987
Zip, zap, zee.

1520
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,699
Are you fucking wearing the Nikes?

1521
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:54,993
Those are my sneakers.
He gave 'em to me.

1522
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,578
It was his dying wish.

1523
01:21:57,496 --> 01:22:00,165
Finders keepers,
lose your sneakers.

1524
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,209
How are you fitting in those?
Those are 11s.

1525
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,002
You're fucking nine feet tall.

1526
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:06,922
You're like the Yao Ming of Nazis.
It's not making sense.

1527
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,383
There's always a way to make things fit.

1528
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:14,763
What were you planning
to do to poor Shecky with this?

1529
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:17,182
Oh, that's just for my mom's Jeep.

1530
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,477
She needed a new gear shifter.
So that's what that's all about.

1531
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:29,570
I think I see
where you were going with this.

1532
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:38,996
You are a sick fuck.
Just like me.

1533
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:42,458
Something tells me you're sicker.

1534
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,334
It was a miracle.

1535
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:46,587
Then they shut it down.

1536
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:48,630
Dr. Fishman basically vanished,

1537
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:51,425
he stopped returning
any of Max's phone calls.

1538
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,510
So finally, one night...

1539
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,888
Max drove over to the clinic.

1540
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,348
He saw that the lights were on,
so he kicked open the door.

1541
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,894
And that's when he saw Ron and Butch
laying dead on the floor.

1542
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,730
But why doesn't he call the cops?

1543
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:08,233
How was that gonna
help Max get any better?

1544
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:11,778
If Dr. Fishman was dead,
then Max was dead.

1545
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:16,742
So that's when he came up with this idea
to bring him back to life.

1546
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,368
But he couldn't do it alone,

1547
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:20,537
he needed somebody else.

1548
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:22,414
He saw where you were in life.

1549
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:26,960
Uh... these are the...
This is the bank.

1550
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:31,215
He also saw that you...
probably needed it more than he did.

1551
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:32,799
Whoo!

1552
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:38,138
Now, I got a question.
What about this dark wig and glasses?

1553
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:39,306
I don't get that.

1554
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,350
Yeah, that's a... a sex thing.

1555
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:43,268
It's a little...
It's kind of personal.

1556
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:45,103
Okay.

1557
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,022
Yeah, and I think that's why...

1558
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:49,233
When he was on the phone with you,
and he had the blow-up doll.

1559
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:50,859
What are you talking about?

1560
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,778
What did I say?
I didn't say anything.

1561
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,279
What are you talking about?

1562
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:55,656
Nothing.
I don't know.

1563
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:57,699
- I don't know. Oh.
- I'm kidding.

1564
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,034
No, I bought him the doll.

1565
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:02,663
Oh, fuck.
Jeez, you both are nuts.

1566
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,540
Where is he, Charlie?

1567
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:06,458
I don't know.
I would tell you.

1568
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:09,253
Dr. Fishman's widow is out there
right now looking for him.

1569
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:13,382
Wait, that chick in the cottage
was Dr. Fishman's widow?

1570
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,134
- Yeah.
- I had no idea he was even married.

1571
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,053
Neither did Dr. Ron, apparently,

1572
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:20,639
considering he had a full-on
love affair with Butch.

1573
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,683
Wow. This all makes sense.

1574
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:27,813
- I never told Max this, but...
- this one time,

1575
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:31,066
I saw Dr. Ron and Butch
coming out of an exam room,

1576
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:35,404
and I... I swear it looked like I had just
caught them doing something nasty.

1577
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:36,530
Oh...

1578
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,740
And he said that they were playing Jenga.

1579
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:42,369
Which I guess was, now, in retrospect,
their secret code for having sex.

1580
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:43,912
"Jenga" is the secret code.

1581
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:47,624
- That's what I just said.
- That's the code. That's the code.

1582
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:51,461
Damn it, Max!
Pick up the fucking phone!

1583
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,887
Sorry to disappoint, man, but...

1584
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:03,473
my old lady works my nips
pretty hard at home,

1585
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:05,851
so not much feeling left in 'em.

1586
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:07,603
You should turn this shit up.

1587
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,898
Perhaps you'll have more feeling
down in this area.

1588
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:16,903
Fuck me in the ass!

1589
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:18,905
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

1590
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:30,917
Sorry, your call could not be
completed as dialed.

1591
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:34,254
Oh, that sounded just like
the recording, buddy.

1592
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:36,048
Whoo!

1593
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,887
Come on, Max.
God!

1594
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,351
Refrigerator.

1595
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:53,023
Oh, yeah.

1596
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:03,617
This is it.
This is it.

1597
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,162
Charlie, where are you?
I can't find Max anywhere.

1598
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,289
I found the formula!

1599
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:12,042
- What? Are you sure?
- Yes!

1600
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:13,669
I'm looking at it right now!

1601
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:16,755
Ronald disguised it
as an app on his tablet!

1602
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,173
Wow, you're amazing.

1603
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:21,176
You are a geek,
but you are the man.

1604
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,845
I'm gonna find Max, okay?
I'm gonna try one more place.

1605
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:28,350
And I won all the gymnastics competitions
in sixth grade.

1606
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:34,064
Then my damned growth spurt.
Seventeen inches in 18 months.

1607
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:39,444
That, of course, put an end
to my competitive career.

1608
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:44,157
Lucky me, I found an occupation
that was even more enjoyable.

1609
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:47,661
Wow. What an amazing story
of personal triumph.

1610
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:51,289
Looking forward to watching the...
30 for 30 on that.

1611
01:26:57,629 --> 01:27:00,757
I just wanna say, before you do
what you're about to do...

1612
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:02,759
your boyfriend or husband or whatever

1613
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:07,514
is just a lucky man to find someone
so talented at ass play.

1614
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:08,724
Good on him.

1615
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,434
I'm not gay.

1616
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:13,270
Would you like some glass sprinkles?

1617
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:14,604
Oh, come on. You...

1618
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,481
If you put that thing in my ass,
you're gay.

1619
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:19,609
I mean, it's cool.
You're in a safe room.

1620
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:22,738
The only one getting fucked here is you.

1621
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:25,407
Yeah, yeah, but are
you gonna enjoy doing it?

1622
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,784
Every last inch of it.

1623
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:29,786
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's a gay thing.

1624
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:33,665
That's... It's not gay.
It's torture.

1625
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:34,791
- No.
- That is different.

1626
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,251
Taking my fingernails off,

1627
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:38,920
or fucking making me stay awake
for 12 weeks is torture,

1628
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,630
but greasing up a dildo

1629
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:42,758
and pretending it's your own dick

1630
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:45,302
and wanting to stick it in me,
that's homosexuality.

1631
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:46,595
Textbook.

1632
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,848
Are you afraid to tell your parents,
is that it?

1633
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:52,142
You know what?

1634
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,393
I'm looking forward to this,

1635
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:55,479
and I'm not letting you
take it away from me

1636
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,230
with your fucking mind games!

1637
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:58,482
God damn it!

1638
01:27:58,565 --> 01:28:00,567
All right, all right, all right.

1639
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:03,820
Look out, teeth, look out, gums,

1640
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,322
look out, keister,

1641
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:07,949
- here it comes!
- Oh, my God!

1642
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:09,075
Heather!

1643
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,620
Get the fuck out of here!
Run, he's crazy!

1644
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,831
What the hell are you doing?

1645
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:17,959
Nothing.
Just two straight guys having fun.

1646
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:20,504
Well, stop fucking around.

1647
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:23,965
Call your boss.
Tell him to get ready to wire me my money.

1648
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,889
You lying bitch.
It was you.

1649
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:33,350
Of course it was me.

1650
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,810
Aw, Max.

1651
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:38,104
Did you really think
that a woman in mourning

1652
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,690
would let two strange buffoons
in her house,

1653
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:42,818
then run around in a slutty Barbie outfit

1654
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:44,694
and let one of them bang her,

1655
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:48,740
even though he's only 5'2"
and smells like a pile of shoes?

1656
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,617
All I had to do was push my tits out

1657
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,703
and you followed them
like horny teenagers.

1658
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:56,998
Do you have any idea
how many lives this affects?

1659
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,500
Why would you do this?

1660
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:03,630
Ronnie was offered a fortune
to bury the drug, but he refused.

1661
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:04,756
I didn't.

1662
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,424
I should've seen this coming.

1663
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,469
Charlie's always had
the shittiest taste in women.

1664
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:12,305
Huh, speak of the devil.

1665
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:24,192
Charlie,
I think Max killed Shecky!

1666
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:26,695
Yeah! He's out of control!

1667
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:29,531
You were right, I think he's
just doing this for the money.

1668
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:32,033
You have to leave his mom's house
right now, it's not safe.

1669
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:36,663
Meet me at Factor's Walk in 15 minutes
and bring the tablet.

1670
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,498
We have to make sure
we get it into the right hands

1671
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,041
before Max finds it.

1672
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,669
Oh, and, Charlie...

1673
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:44,796
be careful.

1674
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:47,632
I don't wanna lose you, too.

1675
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:51,886
Yeah.

1676
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,100
Aw...

1677
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:59,019
He's so sweet.

1678
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:01,187
Actually, you are, too.

1679
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,607
I would have rather fucked you.

1680
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:05,358
Put a bullet in his head.

1681
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:14,409
- Mmm.
- Relax. I'm not going to shoot you.

1682
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:19,998
That would be too quick.

1683
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:24,002
There's still so much fun for us to have.

1684
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,924
Hours of fun.

1685
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:32,969
Ooh...

1686
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,567
Look out!

1687
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,657
Nice try, asshole.

1688
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:11,716
That's how he would have wanted to go.

1689
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:18,682
Charlie!

1690
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:20,475
- Charlie!
- Hey.

1691
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,143
Hey, baby. Baby.

1692
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:23,978
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- I was so worried about you.

1693
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:25,522
I know, I'm freaking out.

1694
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:27,816
I can't believe Max
would do that to Shecky.

1695
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:31,361
It's like we don't know anyone.
My husband, your best friend...

1696
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:33,780
- Money makes people crazy, Charlie.
- I know. I know.

1697
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:34,948
Did you bring the tablet?

1698
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:37,242
Of course, of course.
It's right here.

1699
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,451
Yeah?

1700
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:40,370
Oh!

1701
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:43,665
Motherfucker!
What the hell, Charlie?

1702
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:45,750
You picked the wrong guy to play, lady.

1703
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:49,838
I do know Max and he would
never kill an innocent man!

1704
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,632
Well, I'm about to.

1705
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:59,097
I'm so tired...

1706
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,891
...of women lying to me...

1707
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:03,643
...and fucking me over!

1708
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:07,731
You know why everyone
treats you like that, Charlie?

1709
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:09,899
- Because you're such a pussy!
- Ow!

1710
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:11,901
God damn it!

1711
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:13,737
Ow...

1712
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,530
Ow!

1713
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:24,414
I believe this is mine.

1714
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:26,332
It's been fun, Charlie.

1715
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:27,709
No, no, no.

1716
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:31,337
Before you kill me...
I want to tell you something.

1717
01:32:32,172 --> 01:32:33,798
After we had sex...

1718
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:38,803
you farted in your sleep.

1719
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:41,097
Like, six times.

1720
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:44,142
Yeah, well, no one but you
will ever know that,

1721
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:46,811
because there's no way you're faking
your way out of this death, Charlie.

1722
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:48,104
No.

1723
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:56,154
No!

1724
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:06,748
Max! Ow! God!

1725
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,374
- Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
- Charlie.

1726
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:11,961
I love you. Oh, man, I didn't
mean that shit I said about you.

1727
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:14,506
Fuck that shit.
I don't give a fuck, man.

1728
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:16,966
I just popped the perfect wheelie.
I could be a cop.

1729
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,051
Did you see that?

1730
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:20,595
- All I had to do was fucking...
- I saw the whole thing.

1731
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:21,798
- You looked good.
- Come on.

1732
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:23,097
It's déjà vu.

1733
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:25,850
I get to kill Butch and Ronnie
all over again.

1734
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:28,978
You two wanna tickle each other's
balls first, like they used to?

1735
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:31,231
Or should I kill you straight away?

1736
01:35:39,442 --> 01:35:40,568
Stay where you are!

1737
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:44,155
Drop your weapon
and get your hands in the air!

1738
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:47,492
- No!
- What happened?

1739
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,203
What?

1740
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:52,163
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck?

1741
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:53,831
What, what?

1742
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:56,834
You fucking threw the shit
in the fucking water!

1743
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:59,295
There was
a gun pointed at my head!

1744
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,432
Bob?
From American Express Bob?

1745
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:14,352
Actually it's Bob from the FBI.

1746
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:17,146
Oh... shit.

1747
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:18,564
Here, take the dinosaur.

1748
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:19,816
Yeah, go play.

1749
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,442
What is it?

1750
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:23,546
We fished the tablet out of the water.

1751
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:26,322
I had my best tech guys take a look at it.

1752
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:27,740
And, uh...

1753
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:30,535
it's a goner.

1754
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:33,371
All right.

1755
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:36,040
I'm really sorry.

1756
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:38,960
Oh, baby, we'll find another way.

1757
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:40,545
We're gonna find another way.

1758
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:41,629
Yeah.

1759
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:43,923
We'll keep fighting.
We'll keep fighting.

1760
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:47,969
Mrs. Kessler...
your husband's under arrest.

1761
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,596
When your friend finishes getting
his broken ribs patched up,

1762
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,432
I gotta take both of you directly to jail.

1763
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:54,267
Fuck he is, man!

1764
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,019
Do you know how long
I've waited for this one?

1765
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:57,311
- Sorry, baby.
- All right, we're good.

1766
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:58,515
- We're good.
- Real emotional.

1767
01:36:58,563 --> 01:36:59,731
What's this?
What's this? Wait! Wait! Whoa!

1768
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:03,026
Whoa! He's got broken ribs...
why is he knocked out right now?

1769
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:04,569
We're taking him into surgery.

1770
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:08,614
We found something rather alarming
in his rectum.

1771
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:10,158
- What? What?
- What just happened?

1772
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:12,827
It appears to be a USB drive.

1773
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,374
You backed it up?

1774
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,293
He backed it up!

1775
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:24,047
- You careful motherfucker! Yes!
- Oh!

1776
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:28,259
Yes!

1777
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:29,385
Charlie!

1778
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:31,179
You did it, boy! Yes!

1779
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:32,472
Yeah!

1780
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:34,515
You know,
a good friend of mine once told me,

1781
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:36,479
"You always have to have
a rubber in your wallet

1782
01:37:36,517 --> 01:37:37,810
and an umbrella in your trunk,

1783
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:40,229
'cause you never know when
you're gonna fuck in the rain."

1784
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:43,107
He also suggested carrying
around zombie makeup

1785
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:45,234
for those times when
you want to strike terror

1786
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:47,862
into the hearts of people
who screwed you over.

1787
01:37:50,907 --> 01:37:53,326
Please don't eat me.
Don't eat me! Eat her!

1788
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:58,623
Go get your own fucking fortune cookies!

1789
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:03,336
And most importantly,
when you're really in trouble,

1790
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:05,630
when you've committed many,
many crimes

1791
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:08,508
across several states
and a US territory...

1792
01:38:08,591 --> 01:38:12,470
there's only one chip that can
get you off scot-free.

1793
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:15,932
One card that you can play
to get you out of anything.

1794
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:18,309
An effective treatment for cancer.

1795
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:49,924
Good job!

1796
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,425
- That was so...
- Yeah.

1797
01:38:51,509 --> 01:38:53,386
Yeah.

1798
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,058
What are you doing, Mother?

1799
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:00,768
Why would you do that, Ma?

1800
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:06,232
I just wanted to bring back
some sweet memories to Charlie.

1801
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:09,610
That's really nice, Ma.
He's crying. You happy?

1802
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:12,572
Do they still look as good as they looked

1803
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:14,365
when you peeked on me in the shower?

1804
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:16,826
They're even better!

1805
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:18,828
He's being polite.
It's awful!

1806
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:22,039
They might have a
few more miles on them...

1807
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,294
- but they still taste brand new.
- Oh!

1808
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:29,088
All right, enjoy yourself, Ma,
you're in Puerto Rico.

1809
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:31,507
Hey, come on.
Let's do this.

1810
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:33,885
No, no, no, no, I'm tired.
I'm sorry.

1811
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,219
- Do it, you should.
- You're in remission.

1812
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:37,847
You can't play that cancer card anymore.
Let's go.

1813
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:40,892
Hey! Just do it so we can go out and eat.
I'm fuckin' starving!

1814
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:42,476
- Carmine, be nice.
- I am nice.

1815
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,062
- I have low blood sugar, you know that.
- Carmine's hungry!

1816
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:46,731
You can't fucking keep him waitin'.
Let's go!

1817
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:49,358
Let's go!
All right, love you guys.

1818
01:39:49,442 --> 01:39:51,194
- Be safe!
- Yep.

1819
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:06,209
Sure about this, tough guy?

1820
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:07,335
Fuck yes.

1821
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:09,670
You only live twice, right?
