terrified at their own sinking
poll numbers, attempted to link

figures to make him appear

is his permanent scowl.

me if I want a medal or a

319

honor, I say, "no, mnh-mnh.

president "take the oath."

crowd, somewhere in the front,

maybe next to Beyoncé.

people are paying as much as

the campaign website?

the guy at the car wash, but

it's still free advertising when
a lot of people have seen me in

No, I think -- I think it's
time for me to leave this great

474
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:25,529
country.

475
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:29,166
Oh, I can't bear to see it run
by an African Muslim communist

476
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,967
anti-Christ.

477
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,068
I just can't!

478
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:33,705
It's just like when Nicole
brown Simpson married

479
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:37,242
that nigga o.J.
Back on February 2, 1985.

480
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,412
Oh, I knew it was gonna end badly.

481
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:40,246
I told 'em.

482
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,247
I told 'em all!

483
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:46,153
But nobody wanted to listen to
old Uncle ruckus then, neither.

484
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:50,224
I want to go someplace I'll fit
in, like Norway or Ireland.

485
00:18:50,258 --> 00:18:51,892
Huey: What about the Ivory Coast?

486
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,160
Ruckus: Absolutely no Africa!

487
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:53,860
No way!

488
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:55,961
All them countries got nigga
presidents, which defeats the

489
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:57,963
whole purpose of leaving this country.

490
00:18:58,098 --> 00:19:01,233
How do you feel being teamed
up with your archenemy?

491
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:03,835
Huey: First of all, we're not a team.

492
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,470
Second of all, we're not a team.

493
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:06,871
I've got gas money.

494
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,206
He's got the license.

495
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,278
We're just gonna drive to Canada
and then go our separate ways.

496
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:17,215
You see, bill, I consider
myself a black leader now, and

497
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,018
that means helping Obama and
doing anything he asks.

498
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,320
[ Chuckling ] Oh, yes, I can
hear your concern for the state

499
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:24,823
of the world in that song you did
about stomping people in the

500
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:25,457
nuts.

501
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:26,292
[ Laughter ]

502
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:27,926
Oh, that was the old me.

503
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,027
Everything is different now.

504
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:31,196
I'm much, much, much more
politically aware and stuff.

505
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:34,399
Really? Well, name the three
branches of government, then.

506
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:35,100
The what?

507
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:36,134
Come on, black leader.

508
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:38,003
It's fourth-grade social-studies time.

509
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:39,838
What are the three
branches of government?

510
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:41,940
Uh, let's see.

511
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,475
They got the main branch.

512
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,310
[ Laughter ]

513
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:52,017
Uh... if you're a black leader,
I'm glad I'm a white man.

514
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:55,019
[ Laughter ]

515
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:58,022
What a moron!

516
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,024
[ Laughter continues ]

517
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,266
Huey: What's the point of
talking if nobody ever learns?

518
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:17,273
Ruckus: This is an outrage!

519
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,910
I have my rights!

520
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:22,013
Oh! Oh, them bricks ain't mine!

521
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:23,181
Ain't that a surprise?

522
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:26,351
Already taking away my
constitutional right to bear bricks!

523
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:27,519
Martial law!

524
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:28,821
Martial law!

525
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:30,089
Get your arms off of me!

526
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:34,360
We remain a young nation, but
in the words of scripture, the

527
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:38,365
time has come to set
aside childish things.

528
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:43,237
The time has come to reaffirm
our enduring spirit, to choose

529
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:47,174
our better history...
We demand to see him!

530
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,176
Granddad: No, please!

531
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,511
I have VIP tickets!

532
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:52,812
<i>We all got VIP tickets!</i>

533
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,914
Granddad: Hey!

534
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,248
Riley: Get your hands off me.

535
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:57,250
A'ight, you in trouble now.

536
00:20:57,284 --> 00:20:59,352
I'm calling my nigga obeezy.

537
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:00,252
[ Taser clicks ]

538
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,887
Granddad: Please, don't tase me!

539
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:02,888
Don't tase me, bro!

540
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:03,522
I'm a old man!

541
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:04,456
I got a heart condition!

542
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:05,891
Aaaaaah!

543
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:07,326
You can't do this to me!

544
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,627
I'm a civil rights legend!

545
00:21:08,662 --> 00:21:10,362
Aaaaaah!

546
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,965
Riley: Save us, Obama!

547
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,901
...The path for the
fainthearted...

548
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,608
Huey Freeman is forced to abort
operation exodus because

549
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:23,611
he cannot get a ride.

550
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,515
[ Door opens, closes ]

551
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:32,520
Granddad: Barack Obama?

552
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:34,989
I just found out that fool
is gonna raise my taxes.

553
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:37,257
His promises are just like
his tickets -- worthless.

554
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:39,226
Good thing I didn't
vote for his lyin' ass.

555
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,061
Riley: Obama ain't no real nigga.

556
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:44,063
And check this out -- I heard
he works for the feds.

557
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:46,399
That ain't a good look, barack.

558

Sarah: Washington was indescribable.

559
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:51,237
It was just so amazing.

560
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:52,405
And I got to meet him!

561
00:21:52,472 --> 00:21:54,974
Was he everything you
dreamed he would be?

562
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:57,844
Sarah: Oh, yes, he was,
and so much more!

Oh, yeah, I'm still down for
the cause and [Bleep] But I'm

566
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:02,951
like, "hey, I did my part."

567
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:03,952
You know what I'm saying?

568
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,953
I got the nigga elected.

569
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:07,222
You know, time to get back to
work -- you feel me? -- Doing

what thugnificent do.

571
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:10,592
Besides, them tight-ass clothes
was cutting off my circulation.

Ruckus: Due to the conditions
of my parole, I am unable to

leave the country at this time.

574
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:19,969
I am forced to remain here and
express my extreme displeasure,

while in no way threatening the
life of the president and his
