1
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,193
No.

2
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,272
Not that cell. That's number thirteen.

3
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,238
It's bad luck.
We don't give it to anybody.

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,551
I'm not superstitious, brother.

5
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,108
Brother Vincent. Brother Vincent.

6
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,309
One of the new men
took a cell that wasn't for him.

7
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,310
Crimson Rivers II
Angels of the Apocalypse

8
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,675
Good morning.
Chief Niemans from Paris.

9
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,193
What brings you here?

10
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,272
New Year,
but we're a bit early.

11
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,351
Leave it to me.

12
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,078
We're still in shock
and we're afraid of the media.

13
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,949
We don't want any bad publicity.
- Neither do I.

14
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,709
Do they have to be here?
- Where is it?

15
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,273
Follow me.

16
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,472
Start, gentlemen.

17
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,430
Perform a DNA test.

18
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,236
Where can I wash my hands?

19
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,916
Nobody's going to answer.

20
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,673
They took the vow of silence.

21
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,195
This is a Montanistic monastery.

22
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,430
But that probably doesn't
mean anything to you.

23
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,594
Montanus, preacher from the second
or third century.

24
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,716
Congratulations.

25
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,997
I thought that movement had long
disappeared.

26
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,280
We just survived,
until the ninth century in Lombardy.

27
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,992
That's when Lothar II built this
this convent, our only refuge.

28
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,596
How many people live here?

29
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,398
Thirty two.

30
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,996
And nobody's missing?
- Nobody.

31
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,829
When was that wall restored?

32
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,474
Last week,
by two local bricklayers.

33
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,474
Do you have a file.
- No, we don't archive anything.

34
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,392
Tell me, why do your monks
have dirt under their nails?

35
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,473
The hardest work
is in the vegetable garden.

36
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,074
Especially now that the weather's
acting up.

37
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,154
Kevin?

38
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,756
Did you see the little boy
who was with me just now?

39
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,118
Did you see a little boy
with brown hair?

40
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,911
What are you doing here, boy?

41
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,038
How did you get there?
Thank you, sir.

42
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,749
You scare me.
- There's a phone call for you.

43
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,394
Yes? I don't want to know.

44
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,314
Send a theology expert.
As quickly as possible.

45
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,075
Fine. Thanks.
- Nothing, the DNA results came in.

46
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,152
He was alive
when he was walled in.

47
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,392
Chief, that will be our police
station.

48
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,393
We don't have a name.

49
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,839
Philippe Esaquidar.
Is that him?

50
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,391
That was him. Print it.

51
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,230
Agricultural area measure,
three letters.

52
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,472
Hectometre.
- Three letters.

53
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,911
Stop. Stop.

54
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,672
Won't you let me sleep?

55
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,715
19 hours of surveillance.
I'm trying to have some fun.

56
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,269
And you give me hell.

57
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,591
When a dealer stays away for 19
hours, something's wrong or he moved.

58
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,718
He doesn't live here. Only his woman.

59
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,672
You hurt me.

60
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,799
What are you doing?
- We've been in this hole for 3 weeks.

61
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,195
She's been alone for 19 hours.
I'll take care of it and we're going home.

62
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,713
Don't be stupid.

63
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,599
Don't do something stupid, damnit.

64
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,473
We've been tailing him for 6 months.
- Way too long.

65
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,912
Pénélope?

66
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,078
I don't want to bother you.
Emilio gave this address.

67
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,871
He said to wait downstairs.
But I've been freezing for 2 hours now.

68
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,911
So I thought, maybe dear Pénélope
might have coffee for me.

69
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,958
To get warm again.

70
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,557
I don't have any coffee. Only tea.
- Tea is fine too.

71
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,679
Sit down.

72
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,671
Have you known Emilio for long?

73
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,753
Well, I don't know... seven years.

74
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,916
I don't have any sugar.
- That's ok.

75
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,433
Thanks.

76
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,391
I don't know why I let you in.
Emilio doesn't want me to let anybody in.

77
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,676
He's always rather paranoid, isn't he?

78
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,836
Have you known him for long?
- We did quite a lot of business together.

79
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,469
If Emilio wasn't so jealous...

80
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,312
... I'd fuck you.

81
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,149
That's sweet of you.

82
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,998
You must be good in bed.

83
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,317
He's not going to do her, is he?
- Don't be stupid.

84
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,833
Incredible.

85
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,039
Will Emilio stay away for long?

86
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,514
He'll be right back. And you're leaving.

87
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,195
And I get laid.

88
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,913
Open up.

89
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,870
Where are you? Open up.
- Guys.

90
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,872
Did you see anybody come in?

91
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,390
No, nobody. Nothing's happening.

92
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,834
Open up.

93
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,639
What are you doing here, asshole?

94
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,633
Asshole. I told you not to let
anybody in, bitch.

95
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,711
Next time, I'll kill you.

96
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,870
Who are you, jerk? A cop?

97
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,398
Don't move.

98
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,755
Give me your hands. Your wrists.

99
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,956
Don't move, asshole.

100
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,749
Damnit. My arm.

101
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,478
Get up. Get up, damnit.
Go on.

102
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,633
Repeat that inside and in French
if you don't mind.

103
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,270
Philippe was my eldest brother.

104
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,754
He didn't drink or party.

105
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,751
He was the prodigy child.

106
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,590
Until he went crazy.

107
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,473
He died walled in, like
Nostradamus.

108
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,471
Do you know why Nostradamus
had himself walled in?

109
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,194
No.

110
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,678
So that nobody would walk over
his grave.

111
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,957
Do you think your brother...

112
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,350
Would he have asked that they...

113
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,028
He was crazy, but not that crazy.

114
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,474
He wanted to suffer like Christ.
He can't complain.

115
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,714
Why did you speak German before?

116
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,510
Why not. They buy everything here.

117
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,037
Every day, I get an offer
for my house.

118
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,514
A good opportunity to start life all
over again somewhere else, isn't it?

119
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,309
Why should I?

120
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,552
Isn't the Last Judgment approaching?

121
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,435
That's what my brother said.

122
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,751
How long had your brother been saying...

123
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,398
...strange things?

124
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,708
Ever since he met his master.

125
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,710
His light.

126
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,349
And does that light have a name?

127
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,879
Jesus.

128
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,080
Two steaks
are lost in the forest.

129
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,836
After a while, the first one turns
around. Nobody left.

130
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,991
Suddenly, the second one appears.

131
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,550
'Where were you, ' asks the other one.

132
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,077
'Hiding. '
- I don't understand.

133
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,519
Damnit.

134
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,879
Where did that jerk come from?

135
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,998
Are you ok? Can you hear me?
- I didn't see him coming.

136
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,038
Looks like Jesus. You should
stay on the crossing, Jesus.

137
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,509
Don't move.
- Do you think this is funny?

138
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,076
We're taking you to hospital.
Park your car.

139
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,470
Please.
- Reda...

140
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,438
Where are you going?

141
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,230
Hello, do you hear me?
Do you hear what I'm saying?

142
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,710
Did anybody do anything to you?

143
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,478
Try to calm down.

144
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,074
Do you want to go to hospital?
I'll take you.

145
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,559
I can help you.
Look, I'm a police officer.

146
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,918
Please. No.
- Calm down.

147
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,834
Call an ambulance.

148
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,078
Calm down. I'll help you.

149
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,198
Lord.
- I can help, I'm a police officer.

150
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,470
Lord.

151
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,472
Father.

152
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,597
Open up.

153
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,273
Lord.

154
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,911
They're coming.
- Who?

155
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,514
They're coming. They're here.
- Who's here?

156
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,999
What should we do?
- That's not a nail, that's a bullet.

157
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,872
Call an ambulance.

158
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,076
What's that bullshit?

159
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,195
Stop it, he's in hospital.
It's ok.

160
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,910
Identity unknown

161
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,999
Good morning. Chief Niemans.

162
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,072
What do you want?
- I want to talk to you.

163
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,872
If you're looking for my husband,
he disappeared 3 months ago.

164
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,515
Not a word since.

165
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,118
Not a word, nothing.
Excuse me.

166
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,711
Turn off the TV, Sébastien.

167
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,358
I talked to Michel Esaquidar,
Philippe's brother.

168
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,272
A friend of your husbands.

169
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,510
The TV, Sébastien.

170
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,992
I haven't seen him in a long time,
I'm glad to say.

171
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,830
Philippe was found dead yesterday.
- He's dead?

172
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,116
In a monastery near the German border.

173
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,039
Go play in your room, children.

174
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,309
I know it would end badly.
That monastery is cursed.

175
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,677
Everybody in the area knew.
But they were stubborn.

176
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,799
Who are 'they'?

177
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,875
If you want me to find your
husband alive...

178
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,150
... you have to tell me what you know.

179
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,077
André got him into it.
- André who?

180
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,039
I don't know. And Thomas Duret.
He's a bricklayer with a local company.

181
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,876
But André is the brain.

182
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,753
Even at school he was messing
with my husband's head.

183
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,751
How should I put it...

184
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,473
He always saw Jesus in him.
My husband has a sweet face and...

185
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,993
Please go on.

186
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,516
André bought the monastery
for a song.

187
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,278
What did he want with it?

188
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,438
In the cities,
many people are drifting, he said.

189
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,915
He wanted to give them spirituality.

190
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,794
He was very religious, just
like my husband.

191
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,999
It may sound strange,
but they loved the people.

192
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,077
Real Christians.

193
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,235
They wanted to protect the people.

194
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,550
Protect them from what?
- From danger.

195
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,910
They were not many,
but they believed in it.

196
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,789
And the people felt that.
They had followers.

197
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,229
Until the previous owners
wanted the monastery back.

198
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,794
And did you know their followers?

199
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,398
No, just André.
I never met the others.

200
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,431
Do you know how many there are?

201
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,119
Wait a moment.

202
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,479
Twelve.

203
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,598
How is our prophet?

204
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,157
Very well. He sang a song all
morning, for fun.

205
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,038
What kind of song?

206
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,477
Something religious.
Almost funeral music.

207
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,108
Not really dance music, right?

208
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,635
Is that an invitation?

209
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,878
I'm going to visit our friend.
he must be bored all alone.

210
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,513
He's not alone.

211
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,468
There's a priest with him.
- A priest?

212
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,873
Father?

213
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,308
Father.

214
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,031
Come on. Breathe.

215
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,039
Breathe.

216
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,149
Don't let him go.
Close the doors.

217
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,630
Urgent assistance in 22.
-Don't let him leave.

218
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,154
Father, you can't...

219
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,830
Father.

220
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,678
Don't try anything.
Against the wall with your hands
in the air.

221
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,393
Mommy.

222
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,393
Stay there.

223
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,833
Stay there.

224
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,113
But...

225
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,953
Nobody passes.

226
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,071
Nobody passes.

227
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,953
That was the slogan of the 155th artillery regiment.
- Correct.

228
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,595
Were you with them?
- Not me, my father.

229
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,799
Are you following in your old man's footsteps?
- Something like that.

230
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,391
I'm here for a worker who worked here.
- Follow me, I'll allow you a visit.

231
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,915
150 kilometres of tunnels.

232
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,795
Six for the Fermont fort alone.

233
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,351
Back then, there were six armed posts...

234
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,036
... and more than 600 men...

235
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,035
...spread over all the tunnels of the
Maginot line.

236
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,954
Ok, we're here.

237
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,435
It's there, in the back.
- Thank you.

238
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,753
I'm looking for one of your
bricklayers, Thomas Duret.

239
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,952
Tell him I've also been looking for
him. For two weeks.

240
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,673
He even forgot his pay.

241
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,552
When did you last see him?

242
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:24,677
Easy, on a Friday night.
The seventh. Friday the seventh.

243
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,110
He said goodnight
and you never saw him again?

244
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,079
No, we left at 6.
No more Thomas.

245
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,436
Only his things.
- Did anybody see his car?

246
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,073
No, nobody.

247
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,719
So nobody saw him leave?

248
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,310
After a whole week, we won't also
spend the weekend here.

249
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,638
Where does that tunnel lead to?
- To Hochwald.

250
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,349
The next fort, but it's deserted.

251
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,194
Is there a way out there?
- No idea, it's at least 15 kilometres.

252
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,516
We're not going to walk that now, are we?

253
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,395
Damnit, what's that?

254
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,555
That door wasn't there?
- No.

255
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,078
Call this number
on behalf of chief Niemans.

256
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,317
Tell them to send a team.
They'll understand.

257
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,032
Damnit, Thomas.
- What do you want?

258
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,434
There was a phone call for you.
They found Jesus.

259
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,873
I don't know...
- Sometimes you have to make a decision.

260
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,832
Hello.
- What are you doing here?

261
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,315
Mathilde said
things were pretty hot yesterday.

262
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,994
I don't need temperatures.
You're supposed to be on guard upstairs.

263
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,590
Don't give me hell, Reda.
There's already a chief there.

264
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,314
Did he show ID?
- No.

265
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,595
You guard the entrance.
- I should have studied medicine.

266
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,388
Hey, little chief...
Be nice and turn around slowly.

267
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,119
Niemans? What are you doing here?

268
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,113
A special investigation,
who gets that?

269
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,752
And you? No longer at school?
- School, that's eight years ago.

270
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,273
And you, not retired yet?

271
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,916
Get my cassette recorder, will you.

272
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,239
What are you giving him?

273
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,959
C-37.

274
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,909
It stimulates nerve tissue
around the cortex and the memory.

275
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,998
Police manual, part 4, chapter 12.

276
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,118
Narcotics and their
pharmaceutical derivatives.

277
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,993
The riders...

278
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,313
Father... all four are here.

279
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,992
The seals...

280
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,598
They'll open the seals.

281
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,319
Which seals?

282
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,869
The dead come back...

283
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,030
The fifth seal has been opened.

284
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,510
The fifth seal has been opened...

285
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,828
They're coming back
for the Last Judgment...

286
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,911
God...

287
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,874
Yes, what can I do for you?
- You asked for a specialist.

288
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,393
Yes.

289
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,878
I'm a bachelor of theology with a state certificate.

290
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,548
The religious West
and it's modern application.

291
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,320
It's a pleasure to work with you.

292
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,471
The pleasure is mutual.

293
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,550
Do you only say hello
to chiefs?

294
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,756
Excuse me.

295
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,831
Captain Reda.
- Marie.

296
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,433
How fitting, this is Jesus. He's been
rambling about the end of the world for an hour.

297
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,915
When he hears your name is Maria...

298
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,870
He got a light sedative.
- Yes, a diluted atomic bomb.

299
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,110
It's all on the cassette tape.

300
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,077
They're here.

301
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,351
The angels...

302
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,312
... of the Apocalypse.

303
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,113
No sugar, correct?

304
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,509
Good memory.

305
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,837
Still scared of dogs?
- It's getting better. I've got one.

306
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,474
Good.
Which model? Doberman?

307
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,915
Bull terrier?

308
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,198
Yorkshire.

309
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,756
That's almost a guinea pig.

310
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,509
I hope you feed it seeds?
It would choke on dog food.

311
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,037
What's his name, the chief's best friend?

312
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,953
Well done, back then in the Alps.
- It almost went wrong.

313
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,991
Do you follow what I do?

314
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,068
The policy academy would have lost
a good teacher.

315
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,872
Don't flatter me.
You're no longer a student.

316
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,794
I made a memo for both of you.

317
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,271
For you, the twelve apostles.
Description, map...

318
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,994
For you, John's Apocalypse.

319
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,630
You'll be fascinated.

320
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,271
Can't you give me the short version?

321
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,754
Short?

322
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,594
The Apocalypse consists of seven seals
that seal the Holy Book.

323
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,356
Each stage contains a message
and opens a seal.

324
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,312
The seals Jesus referred to.

325
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,596
First the riders. There are four.

326
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,235
The fifth seal
is the resurrection of the dead...

327
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,391
...all in white robes.

328
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,196
The sixth seal is the earth
that shakes and shatters.

329
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,111
Then there is half an hour of silence...

330
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,710
... and the arrival of the seven angels
of the Apocalypse.

331
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,311
That guy from yesterday looked like this.
- Was he alone?

332
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,069
Yes...

333
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,119
Well, I think so.
- And finally the book.

334
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,276
By God's hand.

335
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,839
Who opens the seventh seal, can
read it and become one with him.

336
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,671
That's it. Fairly simple.

337
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,312
And our Jesus knows all this?

338
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,315
He's a believer. He believes that
the end of the world is upon us.

339
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,593
External elements must have given him
apocalyptic visions.

340
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,951
Like the death of his apostles?
- No doubt.

341
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,553
Did you find anything?

342
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,640
Signs on the walls
of the victims.

343
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,756
The signs and the names are correct.

344
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,911
The cross and the two loaves
for Philippe.

345
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,390
Carpenter's square and lance for Thomas.

346
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,959
It's all been staged.

347
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,433
Yes?

348
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,193
Don't touch anything.

349
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,074
God.

350
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,557
Do you buy from here often?
- Sometimes.

351
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,470
The bodies are in the workshop.

352
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,236
The customer already found them.
- She's already been interrogated.

353
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,675
Can I have their names?

354
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,799
Judas Marcherin and Simon Viarnet.
They were associates.

355
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,073
Can I have your notes for a moment?

356
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,914
Please.

357
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,318
Look.

358
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,595
What?
- It's unbelievable...

359
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,918
What is?

360
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,869
The names are correct,
but also the professions of the apostles.

361
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,595
Philip owned a small company,
as did Philippe Esaquidar.

362
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,917
Saint Thomas was a bricklayer,
like Thomas Duret.

363
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,676
Apostles Judas and
Peter were tradesmen.

364
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,431
Do you know the professions
of the seven others?

365
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,877
Bartholomew was a caretaker,
Matthew was a publican.

366
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,398
Simon the Zealot held no profession.
And the other four were fishermen.

367
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,312
The parrot in the picture
must be the lab's logo.

368
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,676
I want to know who took that picture.

369
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,357
Find out whether a caretaker or customs
officer have been killed recently.

370
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,272
Maybe they can still be saved.

371
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,318
You mentioned fishermen?

372
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,714
Why don't they just
kill them?

373
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,356
So the others in the picture get so
scared they won't talk.

374
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,073
Hello.

375
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,793
A glass of white wine.
- We're not in the Alsace.

376
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,952
A glass of milk then, is that
possible?

377
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,755
Cut it out, Reda.
we'll have three Lorraines.

378
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,229
Do you know any of these 12 people?
- No.

379
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,879
Nobody.

380
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,120
Are you sure?
- I won't repeat myself.

381
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,397
And if I smash up your place,
would that open your eyes?

382
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,755
The four on the left have a
little white cabin at the lake.

383
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,911
Behind the hill.

384
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,360
There are plenty of artificial
lakes here.

385
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,554
Created in the thirties and connected
by a canal.

386
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,952
It's like a Maginot line of water.

387
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,273
Saw anything?
- No. I'm just a bit tense.

388
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,153
Having fun, I see.

389
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,790
Come, I found something.

390
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,680
I think we're barking up
the wrong tree.

391
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,838
What do you mean?
- I reread your notes.

392
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,192
Apostles Peter, Jacob,
Matthew and John...

393
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,550
They didn't fish for fish...

394
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,958
... but for shellfish.

395
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,228
And here all I see are fishing nets.
There are no shellfish.

396
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,519
And that?

397
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,315
Pull it up.

398
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,913
How long have they been hanging there?

399
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,833
Half an hour.

400
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,195
Get help and look after Reda.

401
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,269
Reda...

402
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,914
Aren't you wounded?
- I'm ok.

403
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,592
There must be a secret entrance
to the turret.

404
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,832
There's nothing in the building plans...

405
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,951
... but the Germans
used it from 1940 until 1945.

406
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,599
We don't know what they did there.

407
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,828
Ask Paris about the reconstructions
performed here in 1940.

408
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,353
We've got the photographer.

409
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,832
He's the caretaker of a supermarket
and his name's Barthélémy Debernault.

410
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,352
And three days ago, a customs officer
was killed at an airport.

411
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,633
Marie, find out in which
church that picture was taken.

412
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,991
Reda, come with me.

413
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,671
In French, brother.
In French.

414
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,995
Of course.

415
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,351
Excuse me. The emotions.

416
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,159
Control your emotions.

417
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,631
Don't be so sensitive.

418
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,589
Of course.

419
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,794
Don't be too religious.

420
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,909
Customs officer brutally slaughtered.

421
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,231
Gentlemen?
- Do you know Barthélémy Debernault?

422
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,709
Yes, he's in the shop. Why?

423
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,831
Can you point him out?
- Yes.

424
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,877
Michel, the shop.

425
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,033
The bottom screen.

426
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,709
Barthélémy...

427
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,912
He quit as caretaker.
Without any explanation.

428
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:53,596
is he acting different?
- He's rather nervous.

429
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,239
Barthélémy was
caretaker of the shop.

430
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,232
What did he do?

431
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,949
Have the guards
block all the doors.

432
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,316
Quickly.
- There.

433
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,631
A monk.

434
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,950
That's not possible, damnit.
There was a monk there just now.

435
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,633
Is that thing working?

436
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,791
Niemans, do you hear me?
- Yes. Still nothing on the screens.

437
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,592
That's not possible. Look.

438
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,957
He can't have disappeared.

439
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,639
Aisle twelve. He's going straight
towards Barthélémy. Run, Reda.

440
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,438
Left, Reda.
Left.

441
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,158
Turn on the microphone.

442
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,439
Barthélémy Debernault?
Run, Barthélémy, run.

443
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,913
Don't lose him.

444
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,753
I've got him.

445
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,949
Complete analysis and identification.
Within 2 hours.

446
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,355
Shit, filthy weather.

447
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,160
We've got the blood analysis
from the supermarket.

448
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,518
Can you please sign?

449
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,792
What is that?
- An application for an extra vehicle.

450
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,514
After what you did to your
last car...

451
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,079
Nothing special.

452
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,113
No suspect substances?
- No.

453
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,948
That's impossible.

454
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,358
He can't be clean.

455
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,755
Or else his power truly
is supernatural.

456
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,474
We failed. They're dead.

457
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,035
Why do you always call when I'm working?

458
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,234
I'll call you in two hours.
Don't call me when I'm working.

459
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,831
Niemans.

460
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,399
What's happening?

461
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,394
What do they want?
- No idea.

462
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,874
And beware of those two snooping
detectives.

463
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,674
They won't take us by surprise again.

464
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,389
Good morning, gentlemen. Police.

465
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:13,395
It's six o'clock
and this is a search warrant.

466
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,716
Where are you going?
- Outside.

467
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,791
Nobody's going outside.

468
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,038
Heinrich von Garten, Minister of
Cultural and Religious Affairs...

469
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,236
... of the government in Berlin.

470
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,911
We said nobody.

471
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,513
Remove your hand.

472
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,793
Let him go.

473
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,357
One phone call from me and
you're fired.

474
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,033
See you very soon.

475
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,752
To work, men.
Search that joint.

476
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,913
What do we do?
- Nothing.

477
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,593
Did we check their communications?
- They didn't make one call.

478
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,510
Keep looking. We have to find something.

479
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,072
Nothing. We found nothing.

480
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:44,558
That's impossible. It's got to be
here somewhere.

481
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,031
Is that church far from here?
- Which church?

482
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,595
The church in the picture.
With the apostles.

483
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,836
Still nothing about the convent?

484
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,838
I found the sign
of the Montanists.

485
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,513
Look.

486
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,953
What does JEO mean?

487
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,634
JE or IE
is the Hebrew name of Jahweh.

488
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,631
In other words, the father.

489
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,997
EO is the son. IEO, IEO...

490
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,959
The Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit.
Three circles.

491
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,955
But I'm not sure,
because of that reverse E.

492
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,513
Bernard, king of Italy...

493
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,956
... and cousin of Louis I, who
was the grandfather of Lothar II...

494
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,276
... is driven out of Italy in 818...

495
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,755
... but takes with him the biggest
treasure from the Vatican.

496
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,679
Sp big that the Vatican
never confirmed it.

497
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,193
And where is that treasure?

498
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,670
With the only relative who wasn't his enemy:
Lothar I.

499
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,279
The father of II.

500
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,354
Exactly.

501
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:52,559
The strange thing is that last week, the seal
of Lothar II was stolen.

502
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,109
What is that seal exactly?
- Some kind of key.

503
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,793
To what?

504
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,430
To the tomb of Lothar II
and his treasure.

505
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,636
I have the police report here.

506
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,076
What did the treasure consist of?
- Nobody knows.

507
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:10,398
It's supposed to be 'the most beautiful
treasure a Christian can own'.

508
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,635
Where there's hate,
I'll bring love.

509
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,478
Where there's violence,
I'll bring forgiveness.

510
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,911
Where there's discord,
I'll bring unity.

511
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,270
Where there's error,
I'll bring truth.

512
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,994
Where there's doubt,
I'll bring faith.

513
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,476
Where there's despair, I'll bring...
- Father, please?

514
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,950
I wouldn't do that, Father.

515
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,358
We need to talk.

516
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,399
It's ok. Please.

517
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,759
Who is he?

518
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,110
A survivor.
- The Zealot.

519
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,390
Are all the others dead?

520
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,674
Jesus is in hospital.
Tell me what you know.

521
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,790
It's too late already.
We incurred the wrath of God.

522
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,670
The angels of the Apocalypse have arrived already.
- There we go again.

523
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,068
Stop your predictions.

524
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,959
There are no angels.
We've come to help you.

525
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,076
Tell us what you know.

526
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,598
We're discussing...

527
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,994
We're discussing the Great Book.
From God's hand.

528
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,916
When we restored the monastery...

529
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,715
... we found the entrance
to Lothar's grave.

530
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,152
And the treasure he took.

531
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,035
And the seal that opens the cellar?
Did you steal it?

532
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,952
I didn't steal it.

533
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,357
And I came here
to hide in my old parish.

534
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,791
We were the only witnesses.

535
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:59,518
The treasure can't
fall into the wrong hands.

536
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,837
Where's the seal?

537
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,470
Give me a moment.

538
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,673
Lay down.

539
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,233
Forgive me, Lord.

540
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,470
Unharmed?
- Yes.

541
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,153
Are you ok?

542
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,670
How did you know there was a bomb in it?

543
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,031
You told me I'd make a good cop.

544
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,831
Where are you going?

545
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,757
I want to study them further.
I'll return them tomorrow.

546
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,229
Do you think you can do anything
because you're a cop?

547
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,509
And you think you can take the divine
writings with you?

548
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,116
Are you worthy of reading them?

549
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,116
Who are you in the eyes of God?

550
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,679
Who?
- What's wrong, brother?

551
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,755
These are holy writings.

552
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:53,789
I'd prefer you read them
here.

553
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:59,588
Aren't you referring to the Holy Book
Lothar was supposed to have possessed?

554
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,433
I don't know what you mean.

555
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,113
Oh, no?

556
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,193
But for the book
you need a key.

557
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,436
And I have that key.

558
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,158
But that's impossible.
They've got it.

559
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:20,074
Or else it'll be too late.
Tomorrow, the door must be opened.

560
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,798
The door?

561
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,871
Where's the door, brother?

562
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,917
Where's the door?

563
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,078
It's mine.

564
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,918
Mine.

565
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,793
Soap.

566
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,315
For 2000 years you have been
selling useless stuff.

567
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,471
Now you can see the effect for yourself.

568
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,630
Take what you need.

569
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,718
Marie, call a doctor.

570
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,553
Marie, quick.

571
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,638
The question to the Germans...

572
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,358
... about the reconstruction plans
of the Maginot line.

573
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:38,479
They say it hasn't been reconstructed,
so there are no plans.

574
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,518
From the bureau of cultural
and religious affairs.

575
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,240
But that's our friend Heinrich.

576
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,232
Heinrich von something.

577
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,717
Why did the priest say the door
has to open tomorrow?

578
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,391
Where is that damned door?

579
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,553
I've got something.

580
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,793
I had a problem
with that reverse E.

581
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,719
But it's not an E.
It's a three.

582
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,713
The J is a seven and the O a zero.

583
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,469
So that makes 730,730.

584
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,833
And what does that number mean?

585
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,276
According to the Montanists,
it's the date of the Apocalypse.

586
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:39,110
To the death of Jesus, on April 7 30,
add 730,730 days...

587
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,398
... and you get
November 27 of this year.

588
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,312
In other words, today.

589
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,200
Shall we get changed
for the occasion?

590
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,510
We can just as well
sit in the front.

591
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,113
And the door?

592
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,999
Didn't you find anything about it?
- No.

593
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:00,036
According to an old text,
the treasure is protected...

594
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,430
... by an infallible mechanism.

595
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,872
He who wants to read the book, incurs
Gods lightning.

596
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,750
That's all I found.
Nothing about the location of the entrance.

597
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,910
Did you hear them yet?

598
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,313
The bells?

599
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,393
They never ring.

600
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,996
There's the entrance to the cellar.

601
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,999
In the tower.

602
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,399
Who's causing trouble at this hour?

603
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,317
Where do they all come from?

604
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,715
A new Europe is emerging.

605
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:22,674
A white and religious Europe,
as it should always have been.

606
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,440
A Europe...
- Our Europe, dear delegate.

607
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:29,952
Heinrich, your operations
have been executed masterfully.

608
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,510
Where do you think you are?
Nobody passes.

609
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,597
Silence him.

610
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,755
When our signal disappears,
warn the army.

611
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,077
I want to come along.
- You should interrogate Jesus.

612
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,556
And keep listening.
I'll need you.

613
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:04,315
Reda, your Apocalypse is coming.

614
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,472
Do you think it's deep?

615
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,310
We'll never have enough rope.

616
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:58,273
We're not going all the way to China.
It's a decoy for nosy visitors.

617
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,674
Go on, I think he's asleep.

618
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,990
Careful, Reda. Careful.

619
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,958
Niemans.

620
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,997
The rope is too short, I tell you.

621
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,715
If the monks go here,
there must be an entrance.

622
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,913
Niemans.

623
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,952
Marie, are you there?

624
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,990
Yes.
- He has to talk.

625
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,549
I've sinned.
- Do you hear me, Marie?

626
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,869
I know.

627
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,397
Marie, do you hear me?
- I hear you, chief.

628
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,192
We're in the Maginot line.

629
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,794
So the line and the monastery
are connected.

630
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,436
I'm losing the signal.

631
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,513
Of course.

632
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,593
There's metal everywhere here.

633
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,993
Marie, do you hear me?

634
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:35,798
That explains your monk with no head.
A balaclava and black around the eyes.

635
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,837
Apart from that, you see what you
want to see.

636
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,315
And this provides supernatural power.

637
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:46,074
War amphetamines.
Banned since 1945.

638
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,590
You feel no pain.
Your strength multiplies.

639
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:54,595
And you obey blindly.
- Makes sense that he beat me.

640
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,549
Cover me.

641
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,159
Marie, send backup.

642
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,910
See you soon, you said.

643
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,273
Welcome to the temple of Lothar II.

644
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,394
I was a young officer back when...

645
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:53,032
... I happened to find a part
of these subterranean tunnels.

646
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,236
I didn't have time to look around.

647
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,909
Victory had changed sides.

648
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,598
For years I looked in all the books...

649
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,633
... to find out what these tunnels were.

650
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:13,359
One beautiful day,
it became clear to me.

651
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,672
The treasure of the Vatican
that Lothar II had taken...

652
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:22,351
... had to be somewhere here
under the rocks.

653
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,316
The rest you know, I presume?

654
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:30,837
The twelve apostles found an entrance,
probably the real one.

655
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,429
You found out, bought the monastery...

656
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,789
... and liquidated the twelve witnesses.

657
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,918
Our Europe
doesn't care about details.

658
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,033
Reda...

659
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,833
Wake up.

660
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,440
Marie? We have a problem.

661
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,229
The Sermon on the Mount...
Nobody can serve two masters.

662
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,557
You can't serve God and money.
- They'll kill us all.

663
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,552
What does the book say?

664
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,471
Marie, do you hear me?
- Very poorly, chief.

665
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,915
The door to the tomb opens.

666
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,637
Tell me where the book is.

667
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,834
The Holy Book...
Nobody can know.

668
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,912
Where is it?
- Hidden.

669
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,958
Marie, the stone opens.

670
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,353
Niemans, what's happening?

671
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,592
What's in the stone?

672
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,916
Marie, the stone's open.

673
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,959
There's a big book.
- Gain some time. I have to think.

674
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:02,875
The year 830, the geometry...
- You die if you touch it.

675
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,554
Don't speak about what you don't know.

676
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,470
You're the one who's dying.

677
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,637
I'm in great shape myself.

678
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,753
I'm not dying at all.
- It's as certain as sunrise.

679
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,273
You're quite the poet.

680
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,553
What does he say?

681
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,871
Marie? Did you find it?

682
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,600
By opening the book,
a mechanism is activated.

683
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,070
The Apocalypse didn't come, as you can see.

684
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,276
The book is on a pedestal.

685
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:38,432
The axes, the light,
the mirrors and weights...

686
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,118
The first counterweight techniques.

687
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,034
It's activated by
lifting the book.

688
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:48,590
Don't touch the book.
It's a trap.

689
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,677
Without a doubt, chief.

690
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,713
Niemans, do you hear me?

691
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,153
What's happening?

692
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,917
Send backup to the Maginot line.

693
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:46,598
Heinrich, evacuate everybody.
- He doesn't understand. Say it in German.

694
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,270
Climb, climb.

695
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,313
Climb.

696
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,117
Damnit.

697
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,313
To the right.

698
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,433
Quick.

699
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,314
Are we in the broom closet?

700
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:26,029
Take it easy. It's a turret,
not a broom closet.

701
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,393
There must be a way out.

702
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,439
The only way out is that fucking door,
damnit.

703
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:35,438
The wheel. Turn it open.

704
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,479
Come on.

705
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,793
Shit, it's not working.

706
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,993
It's not working.

707
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,433
The amphetamine.

708
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:08,914
How fast will it work?
- No idea. Turn.

709
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,512
Turn.

710
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,033
Come on.

711
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,592
They're still alive.
- Good stuff.

712
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:58,196
I can run all the way to Paris.
- Don't you like Lorraine?

713
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,469
His condition has gotten better.

714
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,358
He's been lucky.

715
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,512
That's good news then.

716
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,030
After a week of holiday,
he'll be even better.

717
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,230
You never told me.
- What?

718
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:35,273
What the name of your dog is.
- I thought it was a good name.

719
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,119
He's pretty scary.

720
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,518
For a Yorkshire?
- Yes. I baptised him...

721
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,318
Reda.

722
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:49,033
Are you pulling my leg?
- No, you both have the same look.

723
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,953
Not really.

724
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,752
I was only kidding.
