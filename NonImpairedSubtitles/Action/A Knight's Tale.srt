1
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,197
Should we help him?

2
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:02,039
He's due in the lists in two minutes.
Two minutes or forfeit.

3
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:03,688
Lend us those.

4
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,561
Right. Left.

5
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,118
-Dead.
-Eh?

6
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,965
Three scores to none after two lances.

7
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:27,520
As long as Sir Ector doesn't
fall off his horse, we've won.

8
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,842
He's dead.

9
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:36,237
-What do you mean?
-His life's spark is covered in shite.

10
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,843
His spirit is gone
but his stench remains.

11
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,439
-Does that answer your question?
-No, no, no.

12
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,919
No, he sleeps. Rouse him.

13
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:49,044
I haven't eaten in three days!

14
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:50,523
None of us have!

15
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,880
-Let's fetch a priest.
-No, he's not dead!

16
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,042
You wake up! Come on!

17
00:01:57,929 --> 00:01:59,044
Come on!

18
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:02,967
You manky git!

19
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,608
Roland.

20
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,528
Squire, Sir Ector must report
at once or forfeit the match.

21
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,768
He's on his way.

22
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,318
I haven't eaten in three days!

23
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:20,645
Three days! What did you eat, mate?!

24
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,358
If you wasn't dead, I would kill you!

25
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:25,401
I'll ride in his place.

26
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:29,647
Strip his armor.
I'm riding in his place.

27
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:33,803
Wat, stop kicking him!
I'm riding in his place. Help me.

28
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:35,923
What's your name, William?

29
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:41,082
William Thatcher, answer me
with your name.

30
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,957
It's not Sir William.

31
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,763
It's not Count or Duke or King William.

32
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,124
I know that.

33
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,359
You must be of noble birth to compete.

34
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,562
A detail. The landscape is food.
Do you want to eat or not?

35
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,886
If the nobles find out,
there'll be the devil to pay.

36
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,726
Then pray that they don't.

37
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:40,483
Visor.

38
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:42,202
Come on, we're late.

39
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:19,725
The score stands at three lances
to none in favor of Sir Ector.

40
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:21,763
Lord Philip of Aragon.

41
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:23,807
Stand ye ready?

42
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,922
Sir Ector. Stand ye ready?

43
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:30,924
Ready?

44
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:33,245
I tilted against Sir Ector many times.

45
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:36,168
In practice as his target.
You never struck him.

46
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,805
-Badger me not with details.
-The landscape. Stay on the horse.

47
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:43,565
He needs 3 points.
He has to knock you off the horse.

48
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,959
I know how to score, Roland.

49
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:49,438
I've waited my whole life
for this moment.

50
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,683
For Sir Ector to shite himself
to death?

51
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:31,358
Get it in the cradle. In the cradle.

52
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:32,877
Get it in the cradle!

53
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,003
William, are you alive?

54
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,359
-We won! We won!
-Can you hear me?

55
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:01,559
Get off me! William, can you hear me?

56
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:03,803
We won!

57
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,398
He's breathing. He's breathing!

58
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,448
Sir Ector.

59
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:17,119
Sir Ector. Remove your helmet.

60
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,959
My lord, the final blow of the lance
has bent it onto my head.

61
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:27,200
He says the final blow of the--

62
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,364
I present your champion, my lord.

63
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,758
Twenty.

64
00:07:58,049 --> 00:07:59,164
No, 1 0.

65
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:01,764
-Fifteen.
-Done.

66
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:07,841
Very good. Cheers.

67
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:15,088
Fifteen silver florins.
He didn't want that.

68
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,007
That's five for William.

69
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,282
Five for Wat. Five for Roland,
who's going home to England.

70
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:24,880
Straight to the pub for me.
Eel pie, brie tart...

71
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,887
...tansy cakes with peppermint cream.

72
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:33,603
We could do this.

73
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:36,323
We've done it, boy.
That's silver in your hand.

74
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,041
No, I mean, we can do this.
We can be champions.

75
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:45,806
Give us your coins.

76
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,003
Give me your coins.

77
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:56,486
Now, that's one for you.

78
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:59,562
And one...for you.

79
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,357
Which leaves 1 3.

80
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:05,283
That's 1 3 for training
and outfitting.

81
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:08,319
The tournament in Rouen is in a month.

82
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:10,759
We could split a bigger prize.

83
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:15,719
In one month we'd be on our way
to glory and riches.

84
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:21,244
Or lying in a ditch with Sir Ector.
William, I just want to go home.

85
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:25,806
Tansy cakes. Dilled veal balls.
I'll take my five now.

86
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,767
Oh, wait up.

87
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:36,279
You're going the wrong way!

88
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:38,928
You can't even joust.

89
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,758
Most of it is the guts to take a blow.
Guts I have.

90
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,246
And technique?
I have a month to learn that.

91
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:49,442
And name a man better
with a sword than I am.

92
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,085
-In the practice ring.
-You're not of noble birth.

93
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:54,768
So, we lie.

94
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:58,405
How did the nobles become noble
in the first place?

95
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:03,199
They took it at the tip of a sword.
I'll do it with a lance.

96
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,003
-A blunted lance.
-No matter, Wat.

97
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:10,925
A man can change his stars. I won't
spend the rest of my life as nothing.

98
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,721
That is nothing. And that's
where glory will take us.

99
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:20,167
We're peasants. Glory and riches
are beyond our grasp.

100
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:23,043
But a full stomach?
That dream can come true.

101
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:35,720
If you can take your coins,
go eat cake in England.

102
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,081
But if you can't, you come with me.

103
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:47,205
You see? Money doesn't matter.

104
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:02,003
See how hungry I am?!

105
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:04,320
-Do you?!
-Damn your stomach, Wat!

106
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:08,168
Roland, please.

107
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:14,918
With 1 3 silver pieces,
three men can change their stars.

108
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:24,802
God love you, William.

109
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:27,319
I know, I know. No one else will.

110
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,207
Unlucky.

111
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,120
-I think he's getting worse.
-He is getting worse.

112
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:00,324
Switch.

113
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:07,728
Switch.

114
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:11,045
Glory and riches. Glory and riches!

115
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:23,682
You see how dangerous it is?

116
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:28,324
Faster! Faster!
All right, use those legs!

117
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:31,199
Come on, Roland. Faster! Faster!

118
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:37,638
-You missed it.
-You've done it dozens of times.

119
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:40,802
Well, I guess that means
we should do it again.

120
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,324
Come on.

121
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:47,837
Come on, ponies.

122
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,284
Fong him.

123
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:55,721
Faster. Balance.

124
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,398
No, slower. Keep it steady.

125
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:03,727
I got it! Look, I got it!

126
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:18,368
Any minute now.

127
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:50,721
-Yes, better.
-Nice.

128
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,438
-It's my turn to ride.
-No.

129
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:02,249
We haven't reached the marker.
And you shouldn't.

130
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:06,364
How would it look if my squire rode
while I walked?

131
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:10,967
I don't give a witch's teat!
It's my turn! It's my turn!

132
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:15,646
Maybe nobody should ride.
The horse is not what he used to be.

133
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:18,324
Fine. Fine.

134
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:21,718
Morning.

135
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:23,758
Morning.

136
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,363
Hoy, sir.

137
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:32,038
What are you doing?

138
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:34,680
Uh...trudging.

139
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:39,999
You know, trudging? To trudge?

140
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,604
To trudge the slow, weary...

141
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:46,558
...depressing, yet determined walk
of a man who had nothing left...

142
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:50,239
...except the impulse to simply
soldier on.

143
00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:52,287
Were you robbed?

144
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,369
Interesting question. Yes.

145
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:58,248
And at the same time,
a huge, resounding, " No."

146
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:02,602
It's more a sort of involuntary
vow of poverty, really.

147
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:06,245
But on the brighter side,
trudging does represent pride.

148
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:10,079
Pride, resolve and faith
in the good Lord Almighty.

149
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,003
Please, Christ, rescue me
from my current...

150
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:16,001
...tribulations.

151
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,962
Who are you?

152
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:23,201
Lilium inter spinas.

153
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,641
The lily among the thorns.

154
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,489
Geoffrey Chaucer's the name.
Writing's the game.

155
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:36,403
Chaucer?

156
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,287
Geoffrey Chaucer, the writer?

157
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:45,689
-A what?
-"A what?" A writer.

158
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:50,799
I write with ink and parchment.
For a penny, I'll scribble anything.

159
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:55,281
Summonses, decrees, edicts,
warrants, patents of nobility.

160
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:59,126
I've been known to jot down
a poem, if the muse descends.

161
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:02,247
You probably read my book,
The Book of the Duchess.

162
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:06,688
Well, it was allegorical.

163
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,724
We won't hold it against you.
Each man decides that for himself.

164
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,920
Did you say patents of nobility?

165
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,922
That's right. I did.

166
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:22,801
And you gentlemen are?

167
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:27,366
I am Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

168
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:32,925
These are my faithful squires,
Delves of Dodgington...

169
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:36,322
...and Fowlehurst of Crewe.

170
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:39,644
I'm Richard the Lionheart.
A pleasure.

171
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:42,119
No, I'm Charlemagne!
John the Baptist!

172
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:43,648
All right!

173
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:46,479
Hold your tongue, sir, or lose it.

174
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:51,127
Now you see that, I do believe...

175
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:52,883
...Sir Ulrich.

176
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,002
Thank you, Geoff.

177
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:03,201
Have you any more to say, Master Nude,
or may we be on our way?

178
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,967
-Off to the tournament?
-This is the road to Rouen.

179
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,881
That remains to be seen.
They're limiting the field at Rouen.

180
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:17,199
Noble birth must be established
for four generations on either side.

181
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,687
Patents of nobility must be provided.

182
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:31,447
Listen, clothe me...

183
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:36,243
...shoe me, for God's sake, feed me
and you'll have your patents.

184
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:38,838
No.

185
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:42,964
-Patents of nobility.
-We need him. We need him.

186
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,084
-Let me handle it.
-Be nice.

187
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:52,400
Nice, nice, nice.

188
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:54,688
All right.

189
00:17:56,249 --> 00:18:00,401
Betray us and I will fong you
until your insides are out...

190
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:05,200
...your outsides are in and your
entrails are your extrails.

191
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:12,157
Pain.

192
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:15,128
Lots of pain.

193
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:28,607
I present Sir Ulrich, whose mother's
father was Shilhard von Rechberg...

194
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:33,445
...son of the Duke Guelph of Saxony,
son of Ghibellines, son of Wendish.

195
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:36,641
-Wendish inherited the fief--
-That'll do, herald.

196
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:40,598
Six generations is more than enough.
Show me the patents.

197
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:53,801
Indicate in which events
shall your Lord Ulrich compete.

198
00:18:57,209 --> 00:19:00,246
He'll first meet Roger Lord Mortimer.

199
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,486
Thank you very much.

200
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:15,128
I can't believe it.
You did it, Chaucer.

201
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:18,122
I thank you. I didn't think
we had a chance.

202
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:23,647
My pleasure, William.

203
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,159
If you don't mind, I'll stick around.

204
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:28,923
Be my herald, you'll
get part of the winnings.

205
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,242
Done. Now if you don't mind,
I have to see a man about a dog.

206
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:39,168
Walking out from Cheapside

207
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:42,363
My fortunes for to seek

208
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,609
I passed along the River Thames

209
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:48,801
Its waters did they reek

210
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:52,999
'Twas there I met a pretty lass

211
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:56,127
She said her name was Nell

212
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:10,362
Bell or hell rhymes with Nell.

213
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,008
Would you speak to me?

214
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:10,085
Ah, to speak.

215
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:14,841
Sir, my sex are marked
by their silence.

216
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:17,763
I would hear you speak
if it cost me my ears.

217
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:20,961
That is well, for I do not
want silence in my life.

218
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:23,047
Tell me your name.

219
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,558
-Would you care if I were ugly?
-Yes!

220
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:31,839
I mean, no. I mean--

221
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:34,882
You desecrate the house of God!

222
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,924
Tell me your name.

223
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:55,046
And what would you do
with my name, Sir Hunter?

224
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,209
Call me a fox, for
that is all I am to you.

225
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:03,967
Then a fox you shall be until
I find your name, my foxy lady.

226
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:11,324
He's a handsome hunter.
I give him that.

227
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:14,209
Does this not shock you, ladies?

228
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,597
Certainly, my lord.

229
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:22,039
I only laugh just
to keep from weeping.

230
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,197
Beauty is such a curse.

231
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:29,526
Pray your years come swiftly.

232
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,682
Pray your beauty fades
so you may better serve God.

233
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:36,840
Oh, I do, my lord. I pray for it all
the time.

234
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:41,407
Why, God, did you curse me
with this face?

235
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:46,357
God's will has a purpose,
but we may not know it.

236
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,039
Well, that is lovely.

237
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:24,680
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein...

238
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:30,129
...defeats Roger Lord Mortimer
one lance to none.

239
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:35,327
Easy. They'll think I
never broke a lance before.

240
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:39,841
-But you haven't!
-Ulrich's broken thousands of lances.

241
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,802
Come on. You're due
in the sword ring.

242
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:44,767
My armor's loose.

243
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:55,199
Shite. I can't block an overhead.

244
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:58,919
We can't fix it now.
We're overdue in the sword ring.

245
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:03,285
It was a mistake to do two events.
I'm too hurried.

246
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,965
-I'll withdraw from the sword.
-Sword's what you're best at.

247
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:10,520
But the prizes and prestige
are bigger in the joust.

248
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:13,846
Ulrich von Lichtenstein?
I am Simon the Summoner.

249
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:16,999
I'm overdue at the sword ring.

250
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:21,047
I must detain you
on behalf of your herald.

251
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:23,447
You were never robbed.

252
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,645
I have a gambling problem.

253
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,446
I can't help myself.

254
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:34,522
And these people will...

255
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,962
...literally take the clothes
off your back.

256
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:41,200
What are we supposed to do?

257
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:45,727
He assured us that you,
his liege, would pay us.

258
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:51,123
And who are you?

259
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:54,328
Peter, a humble pardoner...

260
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:56,964
...and purveyor of religious relics.

261
00:24:58,609 --> 00:24:59,724
How much does he owe?

262
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,717
Ten gold florins.

263
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:05,601
You manky git!

264
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:09,883
-Pain! Pain! Take the pain!
-Get him off me!

265
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:11,887
Wat, let him go!

266
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:24,606
What would you do to him
if I was to refuse?

267
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:29,566
We, on behalf of the Lord God...

268
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:34,326
...will take it from his flesh
so that he may understand...

269
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:36,924
...that gambling is a sin.

270
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:41,728
Oh, come on.

271
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:43,963
Please, Will.

272
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:50,008
Please, will you help me,
Sir Ulrich?

273
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,685
I promise you won't regret it.

274
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,920
I don't have the money.

275
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:04,608
Release him...

276
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,929
...and give him back his clothes.

277
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:11,321
And you'll get it.

278
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:12,759
Done.

279
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:18,165
You lied.

280
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:23,000
Yes, I lied. I'm a writer.
I give the truth scope!

281
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:27,124
Behold my Lord
Ulrich von Lichtenstein, son of--

282
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:29,883
-Too late. He's been announced.
-Fine.

283
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:33,605
Ten blows by sword.
Sir Ulrich to receive first.

284
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:41,204
Strike!

285
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:50,878
Strike!

286
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,408
Stop letting him hit you!

287
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,520
Shut up! Shut up!

288
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:58,966
Two strikes for Sir Walter Loring!

289
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:01,359
Sir Ulrich to strike!

290
00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:03,801
-Now it's your turn!
-Come on!

291
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,043
Strike!

292
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:21,881
I taught him that!
That's me!

293
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:25,721
Sir Ulrich prevails,
five strikes to two!

294
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:28,358
Yes!

295
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:33,205
Behold my Lord Ulrich!
The rock! The hard place!

296
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,242
Like a wind from Gelderland,
he sweeps by!

297
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:40,397
Blown far from his homeland
in search of glory and honor!

298
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:44,927
We walk in the garden
of his turbulence!

299
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:53,167
Yeah!

300
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:18,525
-You're champion.
-Of the sword.

301
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:20,919
Isn't that why we're here? Come on.

302
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:24,405
Do you want to touch him?
Do you want to touch him?

303
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:41,958
We should've saved
for the blacksmith.

304
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:44,448
I can't pay you now...

305
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:48,085
-...but I promise I will, just as--
-No! Money.

306
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:55,762
-Excuse me.
-Cash first, not promises.

307
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:57,967
Go on.

308
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,561
Excuse me, sir.

309
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,724
You might try the farris.

310
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:07,283
A woman?

311
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:10,527
Beggars cannot be choosers, my lord.

312
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:14,528
Thank you.

313
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:18,607
-Excuse me.
-I don't work for free.

314
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:22,848
-I can't joust with broken armor.
-That's your problem, not mine.

315
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:26,602
Each drop of this sweat
has a price on it.

316
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,600
Just as well. They told me
I was daft to even ask.

317
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:36,561
-Who?
-The other armorers.

318
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:42,402
Did they say I couldn't do it
because I'm a woman?

319
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:45,802
They said you're good
with horseshoes, not armor.

320
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:48,324
No one mentioned you being a woman.

321
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:53,841
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

322
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:56,240
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

323
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:14,841
Lady, I will win
this tournament for you.

324
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:16,960
Nay! I will win for you.

325
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,881
May I present Count Adhemar...

326
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:22,798
...winner of the joust in France
and champion at Saint-Emilion.

327
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:30,159
All forgotten when standing before the
most beautiful woman in Christendom.

328
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:40,079
Do you only pretend to fight, Count
Adhemar, or wage real war as well?

329
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:45,679
I am leader of the free companies.
My army is in southern France.

330
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:50,523
Geoff, 'tis my lady.

331
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:55,122
-William, you aim too high.
-I don't know any other way to aim.

332
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:58,521
-Concentrate.
-What should I say to her?

333
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:08,441
What do you think of the joust?

334
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:10,841
It's very abrupt.

335
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,884
And I don't understand the rules.

336
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:16,447
Then I shall educate you.

337
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:20,128
A match is three lances.

338
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:25,845
One point is given for breaking
a lance between the waist and neck.

339
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,086
Two points for breaking on the helmet.
It's difficult.

340
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:33,243
The helmet sweeps back.
Most blows glance off.

341
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:36,999
Three points for bearing a rider
to the ground.

342
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:40,446
Also, if you bear a rider
to the ground, you win his horse.

343
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:43,000
Do men die in the joust?

344
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:46,639
Lance points are tipped
with coronals, which blunts them.

345
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:49,888
Of course, accidents happen.

346
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:54,082
I myself, Jocelyn,
have never been unhorsed.

347
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:56,761
Nor have l.

348
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:00,683
Your name, lady.

349
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:02,966
I still need to hear it.

350
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:05,959
Sir Hunter, you persist.

351
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:09,918
Perhaps angels have no names.
Only beautiful faces.

352
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:14,443
And you are?

353
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:16,917
I am, um....

354
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:18,397
Have you forgotten?

355
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:20,446
Or your name is Sir " Um."

356
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:24,926
Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

357
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:27,683
I'd forget as well. What a mouthful.

358
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:30,929
-Your armor, sir.
-What about it?

359
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:35,959
How stylish of you to wear an antique.
You'll start a new fashion if you win.

360
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:39,520
My grandfather will be able
to wear his in public again.

361
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:42,848
And a shield. How quaint.

362
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:57,000
Some of these poor country knights,
little better than peasants.

363
00:33:58,089 --> 00:33:59,522
--the second son...

364
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:03,319
...of Sir Wallace Percival,
third Earl of Warwick.

365
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:06,203
My lords, my ladies...

366
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:09,879
...it is with honor
I introduce my liege...

367
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:12,287
...Sir Thomas Colville.

368
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:20,762
You're good.

369
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,322
You're very good.

370
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:26,048
My lords...

371
00:34:26,729 --> 00:34:28,162
...my ladies...

372
00:34:31,689 --> 00:34:35,204
...and everybody else here
not sitting on a cushion...

373
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:43,641
...today...

374
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,240
...you find yourselves equals.

375
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:57,879
For you are all equally blessed.

376
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:01,239
For I have the pride...

377
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:04,284
...the privilege, nay, the pleasure...

378
00:35:05,249 --> 00:35:09,401
...of introducing to you
a knight sired by knights.

379
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:13,000
A knight who can trace
his lineage back...

380
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:15,805
...beyond Charlemagne.

381
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:19,441
I first met him...

382
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:21,805
...atop a mountain near Jerusalem...

383
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:24,125
...praying to God...

384
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:27,806
...asking his forgiveness
for the Saracen blood...

385
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:29,960
...spilt by his sword.

386
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:33,201
Next, he amazed me
still further in ltaly...

387
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:35,525
...when he saved a fatherless
beauty...

388
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:39,239
...from the would-be ravishings
of her dreadful uncle.

389
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:48,127
In Greece...

390
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:51,682
...he spent a year in silence...

391
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:56,446
...just to better understand
the sound...

392
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:00,447
...of a whisper.

393
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:10,199
So without further gilding the lily
and with no more ado...

394
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:13,083
...l give to you
the Seeker of Serenity...

395
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:15,969
...Protector of ltalian Virginity...

396
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:20,919
...the Enforcer of our Lord God,
the one, the only...

397
00:36:21,249 --> 00:36:25,083
...Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein!

398
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:40,920
Thank you! Thank you!
I'll be here all week.

399
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:48,923
That was different.

400
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:51,199
It's time we celebrated
our differences.

401
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,320
Just maybe not in public.

402
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:55,324
You....

403
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:59,159
Yes, I'm well aware
a good fonging is on the way.

404
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:01,247
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

405
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:04,567
I got their attention.
You win their hearts.

406
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:26,203
Very good.

407
00:37:26,569 --> 00:37:28,287
-Was she watching? Geoff.
-What?

408
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:30,560
-Did she see me?
-Yes, she did.

409
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,919
-Did she see me take the hit?
-Yes.

410
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:36,047
-Was she concerned?
-Her eyes welled up. Just awful.

411
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:54,044
Colville has perfect technique.
I've never seen him before.

412
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:55,643
Nor l.

413
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,800
But this Lichtenstein.

414
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:01,047
His technique, rudimentary.
Style, nonexistent.

415
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:03,683
Still, he's fearless.

416
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:06,885
Fearless? How so?

417
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:10,878
The slit in the visor is narrow,
but splinters can penetrate it.

418
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:14,001
Most knights raise their chins
at the last instant.

419
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:18,999
You lose sight of your opponent, but
protect your eyes. Ulrich doesn't.

420
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:21,759
He keeps his eye on the target.

421
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:24,447
A true hunter.

422
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:35,528
Sir Ulrich...

423
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:38,204
...l'm through.

424
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:42,560
But I've never not finished before.

425
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:46,719
I wish to keep my honor intact.

426
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,244
A draw. And Colville is hurt.

427
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,079
Colville withdraws. Ulrich advances.

428
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:28,121
Why didn't Ulrich finish him?

429
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:30,561
He shows mercy.

430
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:36,282
Then he shows his weakness.
That's all mercy is.

431
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:43,807
For the love of victory, William,
go to sleep.

432
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,117
I can't.

433
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:53,087
Love has given me wings,
so I must fly.

434
00:39:55,689 --> 00:39:57,327
I can't explain it.

435
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:02,718
-She makes me feel like a poet.
-You may feel like a poet...

436
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:04,521
...but you sound like an idiot.

437
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:07,527
-You don't even know her name.
-Her name?

438
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:11,524
Her name is Aphrodite.

439
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:15,325
Calypso. Venus. Take your pick.

440
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:22,084
Women weaken the heart.

441
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:26,043
Without your heart, you cannot win.

442
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:31,880
-But her eyes--
-Concentrate.

443
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,608
Tansy cakes!

444
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:38,564
Count Adhemar sends word.

445
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:42,839
He said he will win
this tournament for you.

446
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:47,682
He's won many. He wins them
for himself and his own honor.

447
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:50,198
It's nothing to say
he wins them for me.

448
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:54,199
He wishes to speak to you again.

449
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:56,720
Not to hear a word I say.

450
00:40:57,929 --> 00:41:00,204
Adhemar wants his women silent.

451
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,846
Would you have Sir Ulrich
win the tournament for you?

452
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:10,363
No.

453
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:14,680
And he is the only knight
who has not promised to do so.

454
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:19,043
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

455
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:22,198
I would have him win my heart.

456
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:34,045
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

457
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:39,641
Oh, lovely.

458
00:41:40,649 --> 00:41:44,005
I don't think I've ever seen
Count Adhemar lose.

459
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:47,327
No, but defeat him
and you'll see it firsthand.

460
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:50,362
My liege.

461
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:53,402
Sir Ulrich.

462
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:56,648
Christiana.

463
00:41:57,249 --> 00:42:01,083
-My lady bids you wear this token.
-Of course.

464
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,283
She also said to tell you, her name...

465
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:07,961
...is Jocelyn.

466
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:12,042
-Au revoir.
-Au revoir.

467
00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:15,077
Oh, Jocelyn.

468
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,961
Concentrate.

469
00:43:39,169 --> 00:43:40,602
I can't breathe.

470
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:49,926
No style whatsoever.

471
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:53,081
But neither has an anvil.

472
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:58,201
-He hits like a hammer. Amazing.
-But not perfect. He aims high.

473
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:01,088
Roll your shoulder back,
his blow may go right.

474
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:04,207
But if he strikes to my left,
I'll be obliterated.

475
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:06,447
I didn't say it wasn't a gamble.

476
00:44:45,409 --> 00:44:48,958
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

477
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:39,643
William?

478
00:45:47,169 --> 00:45:48,602
William, here.

479
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:51,323
Come here.

480
00:46:00,009 --> 00:46:02,364
Someday I'll be a knight.

481
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:06,044
A thatcher's son? A knight?

482
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:09,088
You might as well try
to change the stars.

483
00:46:10,889 --> 00:46:12,641
Can it be done, Father?

484
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:16,285
-Can a man change the stars?
-Yes, William.

485
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:19,402
If he believes enough,
a man can do anything.

486
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:39,688
Come here.

487
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:49,238
Gain more bearing, Ulrich.

488
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:51,840
See me again when you're worthy.

489
00:46:56,969 --> 00:46:58,721
I'll fong you in the arse!

490
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:02,563
Well done, my lord! Well done.

491
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:05,044
-You bastard!
-Go and see to Ulrich.

492
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:07,001
Go see to Ulrich.

493
00:47:10,569 --> 00:47:12,127
Well done, my lord.

494
00:47:12,649 --> 00:47:14,207
A noble victory.

495
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,559
My lady, I believe this is yours.

496
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:31,163
For long spear on foot...

497
00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:33,918
...Pandolfo Malatesta.

498
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:43,047
For sword on foot,
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

499
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:52,125
Finally, for the mounted joust
and tournament champion...

500
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:55,168
...Adhemar, Count of Anjou.

501
00:47:56,769 --> 00:47:59,522
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

502
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:05,928
I present to you your champions.

503
00:48:10,569 --> 00:48:15,006
Next time, you will look up
at me from the flat of your back.

504
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:19,088
Please. You have been weighed,
you have been measured...

505
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,240
...and you have been found wanting.

506
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:30,806
Keep winning the sword.

507
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:33,324
-I won't compete in it.
-It's your best.

508
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:36,123
No. It's tournament champion
or nothing at all.

509
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:43,843
Ten florins. That should do.

510
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:50,039
Sixes and sevens tonight, Chaucer.
Do you feel lucky?

511
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:54,362
-Have you enough clothes?
-Be gone. I'm done with you.

512
00:48:55,169 --> 00:48:57,603
Except to exact my revenge.

513
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:03,325
What on earth could you
possibly do to us?

514
00:49:03,689 --> 00:49:05,884
I will eviscerate you in fiction.

515
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:09,406
Every last pimple,
every last character flaw.

516
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:13,921
I was naked for a day.
You will be naked for eternity.

517
00:49:14,689 --> 00:49:17,078
I have a feeling we shall meet again.

518
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:22,369
Here, farris, take what we owe you.

519
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:27,322
The armor you wear, it wasn't
made for you, was it?

520
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:29,768
So, what of it?

521
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:32,762
I could make armor you wouldn't
even know you wore it.

522
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:34,283
What's the cost?

523
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:37,925
Just take me as far as Paris.

524
00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:41,682
We travel alone.
Take your gold and go.

525
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:54,047
-Get what you can. Let's pack.
-Why are we leaving so soon?

526
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:59,159
The next tournament is in a week.
We can walk now and save the horse.

527
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:02,760
You must go to the banquet.
You'll dance and make an appearance.

528
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:05,079
Let Adhemar laugh at me again?
No!

529
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:07,240
-Yes!
-No!

530
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:16,639
My lady would know the color
of your lord's tunic tonight.

531
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:21,242
-His tunic?
-Yes, so she can dress to match him.

532
00:50:21,609 --> 00:50:24,999
We regret to inform your lady
he won't be attending--

533
00:50:25,249 --> 00:50:28,639
-Herald, do not give my answers!
-Yes, my lord.

534
00:50:28,849 --> 00:50:30,362
Squire, answer her.

535
00:50:30,729 --> 00:50:34,199
What color is my tunic tonight?

536
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:39,528
Green.

537
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:43,247
Trimmed in a kind of...

538
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:45,247
...pale green...

539
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:48,283
...with...

540
00:50:48,649 --> 00:50:50,685
...uh, wooden toggles.

541
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:54,041
I will tell my lady.

542
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:03,918
-This is a disaster!
-No, it'll tunic up quite nicely.

543
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:06,040
That's not a disaster, Roland.

544
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:11,327
I don't know how to dance.

545
00:51:13,729 --> 00:51:17,244
And one and two and three and four.

546
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:20,760
Your hand should be light,
like a birdie on a branch.

547
00:51:21,089 --> 00:51:24,445
And one, two and three and four.

548
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:27,806
And Wat doesn't lead,
he follows like a girl.

549
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:40,446
And one and two and...

550
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:42,367
...twirly, twirly, twirly.

551
00:51:42,729 --> 00:51:45,721
And one and two, and you're
still getting it wrong.

552
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:49,598
And one and two
and three and four.

553
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:53,080
You can hit me all day
because you punch like a what?

554
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:54,557
A girl.

555
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:56,760
-Enough!
-Get back! Wat, quiet!

556
00:51:57,289 --> 00:51:59,166
-He starts it.
-You know he's touchy!

557
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:03,520
Oh, and you can do better?

558
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:06,722
-Of course.
-Then show us.

559
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:09,248
No.

560
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:15,240
If I'm making all this effort,
you'd best ask her nicely.

561
00:52:19,649 --> 00:52:20,718
I'm sorry, Kate.

562
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:28,603
I was wondering if you'd care
to show us how to dance.

563
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:30,804
-Please.
-Please.

564
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:37,405
And one and two, three and four.

565
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:40,647
Five, six, seven, change partners.

566
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:44,126
And one, two, three, four...

567
00:52:44,449 --> 00:52:46,804
...five, six, seven.

568
00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:48,801
Polonaise. And one....

569
00:52:49,649 --> 00:52:51,958
Are you wearing your hair like that?

570
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:54,681
Is there another way?

571
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:26,357
Sir Ulrich, you look fantastic.

572
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:31,285
Jocelyn, you look....

573
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:35,043
Uh, you...

574
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:39,762
...remind me of the Bible.

575
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:49,407
When God stopped the sun to give
Joshua time to defeat the Amorites.

576
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,203
I don't understand.

577
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:01,603
If I could ask God one thing...

578
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:04,404
...it would be to stop the moon.

579
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:08,962
Stop the moon and make this night...

580
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:11,801
...and your beauty...

581
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,087
...last forever.

582
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:19,326
What dance will you have? A coranto?

583
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:22,200
Or a basse dance?

584
00:54:23,169 --> 00:54:24,648
Sir Ulrich.

585
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:29,361
Why don't you show us a dance
of your country?

586
00:54:30,089 --> 00:54:32,284
Show us a dance of Gelderland.

587
00:54:34,209 --> 00:54:36,279
Yes. Gelderland.

588
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:43,008
Well, it's a lot like the farandole...

589
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:47,008
...but with some differences.

590
00:54:48,129 --> 00:54:50,040
Well, you bow.

591
00:54:54,209 --> 00:54:55,688
And...

592
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:08,444
...and....

593
00:55:21,929 --> 00:55:23,965
Places. Places.

594
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:27,004
What?

595
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:33,409
-I don't know. Too small, too light.
-He'll be crushed. Killed.

596
00:58:33,729 --> 00:58:38,166
No. I found a new way to heat steel.
It's thinner, smaller...

597
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:39,961
...but just as strong.

598
00:58:40,249 --> 00:58:41,364
What are these?

599
00:58:41,729 --> 00:58:45,244
The marks of my trade should
another knight admire the armor.

600
00:58:47,689 --> 00:58:50,840
Twist and bend. Feel the movement.

601
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:55,640
-But eventually I will be struck.
-And then death.

602
00:58:56,289 --> 00:58:58,883
Do you at least have the courage
to test it?

603
00:59:07,929 --> 00:59:08,884
You okay?

604
00:59:10,369 --> 00:59:11,961
I didn't feel a thing.

605
00:59:37,929 --> 00:59:40,762
-Who's that knight?
-Piers Courtenay.

606
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:45,088
He's raised taxes on his land 3 times
this year to pay for tournament.

607
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:48,008
His people starve while
he sits at banquet.

608
00:59:51,569 --> 00:59:53,207
It's probably true.

609
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:29,040
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

610
01:00:29,569 --> 01:00:32,083
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

611
01:00:33,449 --> 01:00:34,962
The Count Adhemar...

612
01:00:35,609 --> 01:00:37,565
...son of Philippe de Vitry...

613
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:39,959
...son of Gilles...

614
01:00:40,889 --> 01:00:42,322
...master of the free companies...

615
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,642
...defender of his enormous manhood...

616
01:00:46,329 --> 01:00:48,763
...a shining example of chivalry...

617
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:50,846
...and champagne.

618
01:00:55,129 --> 01:00:56,608
Nice work!

619
01:00:58,009 --> 01:00:59,283
Bravo!

620
01:01:02,609 --> 01:01:05,646
Watch every move Adhemar makes.
We'll find a weakness.

621
01:01:05,849 --> 01:01:07,441
Well, Colville looks fit.

622
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:08,884
--my liege...

623
01:01:09,089 --> 01:01:11,762
...the second son of
Sir Wallace Percival.

624
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,642
It is my deepest honor--

625
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:20,159
My deepest honor to present to you....

626
01:01:20,929 --> 01:01:23,762
It's Edward, my lord.
They're sure of it.

627
01:01:26,689 --> 01:01:29,999
--the illustrious Sir Thomas Colville!

628
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:46,801
Adhemar withdrew.

629
01:01:47,129 --> 01:01:49,563
To withdraw like that means one thing.

630
01:01:50,689 --> 01:01:51,758
Royalty.

631
01:02:01,729 --> 01:02:03,640
I'll see what I can find out.

632
01:02:05,369 --> 01:02:07,007
Prepare to drop the flag.

633
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:09,928
No, no. Not yet. Wait, listen.

634
01:02:10,169 --> 01:02:11,761
Musicians, announce.

635
01:02:12,009 --> 01:02:15,319
-I must speak with my lord.
-Then go.

636
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:18,003
See if you can beat the Second Coming.

637
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,561
Wait! Wait!

638
01:02:22,249 --> 01:02:26,527
Colville is Edward, the Black
Prince, future king of England.

639
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:29,044
He's in disguise like me
so he can compete.

640
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:32,878
He's never met an enemy without
victory or town he couldn't defeat.

641
01:02:33,129 --> 01:02:35,040
We're English! We know who he is!

642
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:38,520
-You must withdraw. Tell them, Geoff.
-Absolutely!

643
01:02:38,769 --> 01:02:39,645
The lance.

644
01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:48,083
Give me the lance.

645
01:02:55,289 --> 01:02:56,404
Lance!

646
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:12,079
Oh, my giddy aunt.

647
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:18,683
The match is a draw.

648
01:03:21,729 --> 01:03:24,163
You mad? You endanger
a royal family member.

649
01:03:24,649 --> 01:03:26,526
He endangers himself.

650
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:29,678
Well fought, Sir Ulrich, as in Rouen.

651
01:03:31,609 --> 01:03:33,281
You also, Prince Edward.

652
01:03:38,409 --> 01:03:40,559
-You knew me?
-Yeah.

653
01:03:44,409 --> 01:03:45,558
And still you rode?

654
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:50,523
-It's not in me to withdraw.
-No. Nor me.

655
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:54,607
Though it happens.

656
01:03:56,889 --> 01:03:58,527
Yes, it does.

657
01:04:00,409 --> 01:04:03,446
-Good luck to you.
-You also.

658
01:04:05,889 --> 01:04:09,882
The winner of the mounted joust and
tournament champion...

659
01:04:10,169 --> 01:04:12,319
...Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

660
01:04:18,169 --> 01:04:21,366
-Melt it, sell it, do whatever you do.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

661
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,764
You're champion!

662
01:04:22,969 --> 01:04:25,881
I'm not champion until
I defeat Adhemar. He withdrew.

663
01:04:26,169 --> 01:04:27,443
Sir Ulrich.

664
01:04:28,729 --> 01:04:32,404
-Tell me what you'll wear tonight.
-Nothing.

665
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:35,442
We'll cause a sensation,
for I'll dress to match.

666
01:04:35,689 --> 01:04:38,123
Don't you get tired
of putting on clothes?

667
01:04:38,329 --> 01:04:40,718
She's talking about taking them off.

668
01:04:42,529 --> 01:04:45,362
A flower is only as good
as its petals, no?

669
01:04:45,729 --> 01:04:47,287
A flower is good for nothing.

670
01:04:49,689 --> 01:04:50,838
Really?

671
01:04:51,609 --> 01:04:54,521
You can't eat a flower.
It doesn't keep you warm.

672
01:04:54,769 --> 01:04:58,079
And a rose never knocked
a man off a horse either, did it?

673
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,923
You're just a silly girl, aren't you?

674
01:05:06,009 --> 01:05:10,685
Better a silly girl with a flower than
a silly boy with a horse and stick.

675
01:05:15,129 --> 01:05:16,403
Goodbye.

676
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:22,320
It's called a lance.

677
01:05:22,689 --> 01:05:24,088
Hello.

678
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:55,921
-I have word.
-What?

679
01:05:56,249 --> 01:05:58,968
Adhemar was called back
to the free companies.

680
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:02,087
Edward commanded it.
He could be gone all season.

681
01:06:03,129 --> 01:06:05,848
First Jocelyn and now Adhemar.

682
01:06:11,289 --> 01:06:12,608
Well done.

683
01:06:12,889 --> 01:06:14,959
Yeah, well done.

684
01:06:25,209 --> 01:06:27,439
The tournament results, my lord.

685
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,044
Ulrich.

686
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:43,123
Ulrich.

687
01:06:43,929 --> 01:06:45,044
Ulrich.

688
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:04,404
-Geoff.
-William.

689
01:07:05,209 --> 01:07:06,801
I need to write a letter.

690
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:09,929
" Dear Jocelyn." No.
" My dearest Jocelyn."

691
01:07:10,209 --> 01:07:11,528
Better.

692
01:07:15,049 --> 01:07:16,164
" I miss you."

693
01:07:17,289 --> 01:07:18,688
Was that wrong?

694
01:07:18,889 --> 01:07:23,360
Well, it's up to you, really.
It's your funeral, I mean, letter.

695
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:27,128
-Say something about her breasts.
-You miss them.

696
01:07:27,929 --> 01:07:28,918
Her breasts?

697
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:34,879
Yes, you could, but I would tend
to look above her breasts.

698
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:37,887
I miss her throat?

699
01:07:38,089 --> 01:07:40,319
Still higher. Towards the heavens.

700
01:07:40,569 --> 01:07:43,288
The moon. Her breasts
weren't that impressive.

701
01:07:43,569 --> 01:07:45,685
The moon? The moon.

702
01:07:48,889 --> 01:07:50,686
" It is strange to think...

703
01:07:52,249 --> 01:07:54,319
...l have not seen you in a month.

704
01:07:56,889 --> 01:08:00,086
I have seen the new moon, but not you.

705
01:08:02,169 --> 01:08:06,685
I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but
nothing of your beautiful face."

706
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:12,720
That's very good.

707
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:15,924
I knew this girl once who....

708
01:08:17,209 --> 01:08:19,439
She broke my heart.
I said the pieces--

709
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:24,160
"The pieces of my broken heart can
pass through the eye of a needle. "

710
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:29,120
He writes as though I had died.

711
01:08:29,369 --> 01:08:32,247
Yes, madame. He dies as well.

712
01:08:33,849 --> 01:08:36,409
She used to cook for the Duke of York.

713
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:42,520
I miss her like the sun
misses the flower.

714
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:45,847
"I miss you like the sun
misses the flower.

715
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:49,999
Like the sun misses the flower
in the depths of winter.

716
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:54,681
Instead of beauty to direct
its light to...

717
01:08:55,289 --> 01:08:59,646
...the heart hardens like the frozen
world your absence has sent me to."

718
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:01,840
"I next compete in Paris.

719
01:09:02,849 --> 01:09:05,841
I'll find it empty and cold
if you're not there."

720
01:09:06,969 --> 01:09:08,402
I like it.

721
01:09:09,209 --> 01:09:11,279
And now, to finish it.

722
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:14,167
With " hope."

723
01:09:14,969 --> 01:09:17,039
Love should end with hope.

724
01:09:18,329 --> 01:09:21,048
My husband, God rest him...

725
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,599
...said something I'll never forget.

726
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:26,802
" Hope guides me. It--"

727
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:30,405
"It gets me through the day and
especially the night.

728
01:09:31,449 --> 01:09:33,838
The hope that after you
leave my sight...

729
01:09:34,089 --> 01:09:36,762
...it will not be the last time
I look upon you."

730
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,047
Finish it with.:

731
01:09:42,689 --> 01:09:46,728
"With all the love
that I possess...William."

732
01:09:48,129 --> 01:09:49,164
You mean " Ulrich."

733
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:53,724
"With all the love I possess...

734
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:57,081
...l remain yours...

735
01:09:57,929 --> 01:09:59,840
...the knight of your heart."

736
01:10:08,449 --> 01:10:12,442
My master hoped you might have
something to send him in return.

737
01:10:26,649 --> 01:10:31,245
Cock-a-doodle once! I shall not deny
him. Twice! I shall not. Thrice!

738
01:10:32,009 --> 01:10:33,522
I deny him.

739
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:35,248
Thrice he denied him!

740
01:10:41,089 --> 01:10:42,568
No Adhemar.

741
01:10:44,169 --> 01:10:45,318
No Adhemar.

742
01:10:50,769 --> 01:10:51,884
Wat.

743
01:10:54,889 --> 01:10:57,801
Tell me, did you see her?
Did she read the letter?

744
01:10:58,209 --> 01:11:00,120
Yes, and yes.

745
01:11:01,009 --> 01:11:01,919
And?

746
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:09,168
She's coming to Paris!

747
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:17,086
Did she give you anything for me in
return? A letter? A token?

748
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:19,839
Did she give me a token? She did.

749
01:11:22,129 --> 01:11:23,403
Uh, I mean, um....

750
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:26,563
Well, what is it? Give it to me.

751
01:11:35,009 --> 01:11:36,283
Yes!

752
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:40,127
Hell, yes!

753
01:11:41,409 --> 01:11:45,084
She-- Because she's--
That means she-- Yeah!

754
01:11:48,769 --> 01:11:50,088
Cinquante.

755
01:11:51,169 --> 01:11:52,727
That's a nice round number.

756
01:11:53,449 --> 01:11:54,598
Excusez-moi.

757
01:11:58,169 --> 01:12:02,242
They wager that a Frenchman, not
Sir Ulrich, will win the tournament.

758
01:12:03,929 --> 01:12:05,567
But the amount is 50 florins.

759
01:12:05,809 --> 01:12:08,607
-That's all we got.
-If we had 60, it would be that.

760
01:12:08,809 --> 01:12:11,198
Ulrich against every Frenchman here?

761
01:12:11,449 --> 01:12:14,998
He's won four tournaments in a row.
And Adhemar isn't here.

762
01:12:15,209 --> 01:12:18,087
I check shields too.
John Beaumont's here.

763
01:12:18,329 --> 01:12:21,799
Count Theobald, Philip of Burgundy--
all French champions.

764
01:12:22,049 --> 01:12:23,482
Englishmen will not win...

765
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:25,407
...this French tournament.

766
01:12:25,769 --> 01:12:29,239
English legs are unsteady
on French soil.

767
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:33,719
Shut your mouth, all right?!

768
01:12:35,329 --> 01:12:39,527
Come on, Roland. It's a good bet.
Win and I can buy my own tavern.

769
01:12:39,849 --> 01:12:42,568
-I could write full-time.
-A forge for me.

770
01:12:42,849 --> 01:12:47,161
And because French wine
is too much for English bellies.

771
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:52,239
Listen, I'm about this fonging close,
mate. I swear to God, Quasimodo!

772
01:12:52,809 --> 01:12:56,927
All I want is to go home, and I've
enough for that trip a hundred times.

773
01:12:57,249 --> 01:13:01,606
And most importantly, because
the pope himself is French!

774
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:07,280
The pope may be French,
but Jesus is English. You're on.

775
01:13:08,289 --> 01:13:10,723
He won't lose with the princess
watching him.

776
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,880
He's blond! He's pissed!

777
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:17,605
He'll see you in the lists!
Lichtenstein! Lichtenstein!

778
01:13:17,849 --> 01:13:21,239
He's blond! He's tan!
He comes from Gelderland!

779
01:13:21,609 --> 01:13:23,520
He comes from Gelderland!

780
01:13:23,809 --> 01:13:26,562
Gelderland!

781
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:45,243
-You think he will come?
-As sure as the sun will rise.

782
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:11,641
You favor cathedrals.

783
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:16,006
I come for confession.

784
01:14:19,169 --> 01:14:21,080
And the glass.

785
01:14:21,889 --> 01:14:25,086
A riot of color in a dreary,
gray world.

786
01:14:26,209 --> 01:14:27,642
Don't you think?

787
01:14:28,649 --> 01:14:30,207
It's beautiful.

788
01:14:34,209 --> 01:14:36,928
I feel the same about
the letter you sent.

789
01:14:39,689 --> 01:14:41,247
Speak to me.

790
01:14:41,889 --> 01:14:43,641
Speak those words.

791
01:14:45,769 --> 01:14:47,964
I will win this tournament for you.

792
01:14:48,729 --> 01:14:49,718
Excuse me?

793
01:14:49,929 --> 01:14:54,719
I'll win this tournament in your name.
I'll defeat each knight for you.

794
01:14:55,049 --> 01:14:59,804
Your beauty will be reflected in the
power of my arm and my horse's flanks.

795
01:15:00,809 --> 01:15:02,083
Wow.

796
01:15:03,169 --> 01:15:04,443
Really?

797
01:15:04,929 --> 01:15:07,159
Really? lts flanks?

798
01:15:10,369 --> 01:15:12,803
I wish to hear poetry, Ulrich.

799
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,120
Well, I'm not ready.

800
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:21,842
I am. Why must everything for
a woman be run on a man's schedule?

801
01:15:22,049 --> 01:15:25,405
Well, a man's day is fuller, and...

802
01:15:25,769 --> 01:15:28,647
...he has more demands on his time.

803
01:15:28,969 --> 01:15:30,880
-Is that so?
-Yes.

804
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:32,644
Maybe.

805
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:34,998
No?

806
01:15:35,329 --> 01:15:37,604
I demand poetry...

807
01:15:38,369 --> 01:15:40,929
...and when I want it.
And I want it now.

808
01:15:43,969 --> 01:15:45,402
Your breasts...

809
01:15:46,729 --> 01:15:49,084
...they're below your throat....

810
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:54,202
Jocelyn, how may I prove
my love to you? How?

811
01:15:56,569 --> 01:15:59,959
-Do you ask in earnest?
-Yes.

812
01:16:03,649 --> 01:16:05,924
If you would prove your love...

813
01:16:06,569 --> 01:16:09,242
-...do your worst.
-My worst?

814
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:12,123
What do you mean?

815
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:17,239
Instead of winning to honor me
with your high reputation...

816
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:20,282
...act against your character
and do badly.

817
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:21,928
-Do badly?
-Lose.

818
01:16:22,169 --> 01:16:24,080
Losing proves that I'm a loser.

819
01:16:24,289 --> 01:16:27,679
Wrong. Losing is a much keener
test of your love.

820
01:16:27,969 --> 01:16:30,358
Losing would contradict
your self-love.

821
01:16:30,729 --> 01:16:34,039
It would show obedience
to your lover and not yourself!

822
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:36,638
-Really?
-Woman, shh!

823
01:16:36,929 --> 01:16:41,241
Do not "shh" me and spare him!
Now be gone! Go!

824
01:16:44,249 --> 01:16:45,477
What is your answer?

825
01:16:49,089 --> 01:16:51,159
I will not lose.

826
01:16:55,809 --> 01:16:57,401
Then you do not love me.

827
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:12,525
The Protector of ltalian Virginity.

828
01:17:13,769 --> 01:17:16,442
The Lance that thrilled France...

829
01:17:16,769 --> 01:17:19,044
...the Harasser of Paraser!

830
01:17:19,329 --> 01:17:21,889
He gave them hell at La Rochelle!

831
01:17:22,569 --> 01:17:25,242
The Enforcer of our Lord God!

832
01:17:26,089 --> 01:17:28,922
The one, the only...

833
01:17:29,769 --> 01:17:31,964
...Sir Ulrich...

834
01:17:32,289 --> 01:17:34,723
...von Lichtenstein!

835
01:17:41,209 --> 01:17:42,608
God, I'm good!

836
01:17:47,649 --> 01:17:49,844
His horse's flanks.

837
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:53,287
Maybe where he comes from,
it means love.

838
01:18:04,769 --> 01:18:05,804
What are you doing?

839
01:18:06,169 --> 01:18:08,239
-Losing.
-I don't understand.

840
01:18:09,009 --> 01:18:09,998
Neither do l.

841
01:18:29,569 --> 01:18:31,048
He loves me.

842
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,203
Are you blind?

843
01:18:36,089 --> 01:18:38,762
-Did you see the flag?
-I saw it, okay?

844
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:41,207
I know.

845
01:18:41,569 --> 01:18:44,606
You're dropping behind
for a more dramatic victory.

846
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:49,881
Look, Jocelyn told me to lose
to prove my love.

847
01:18:52,409 --> 01:18:55,082
-I'd rather you were blind.
-Don't be foolish, Will.

848
01:18:55,289 --> 01:18:59,282
-Each woman wants proof, that's all.
-Proof of what?

849
01:19:00,009 --> 01:19:02,125
Her legs weren't uncrossed
for nothing.

850
01:19:02,329 --> 01:19:06,641
-I haven't uncrossed her legs.
-Then why are we doing this?!

851
01:19:06,969 --> 01:19:08,163
Because!

852
01:19:19,809 --> 01:19:21,128
Because...

853
01:19:22,649 --> 01:19:23,923
...l love her.

854
01:20:04,169 --> 01:20:07,878
-I'm going to lose everything!
-That's why it's called gambling.

855
01:20:09,049 --> 01:20:10,641
Pain! Here's your pain!

856
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:13,039
It's very romantic, though.

857
01:20:13,569 --> 01:20:15,719
Are you a woman or a blacksmith?

858
01:20:16,089 --> 01:20:17,647
Sometimes I'm both.

859
01:20:17,849 --> 01:20:19,601
Ooh, that chafes!

860
01:20:19,929 --> 01:20:21,203
Put him down.

861
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:27,442
No knight has distanced himself
with victories.

862
01:20:27,809 --> 01:20:32,246
If you win your remaining matches
and your opponents take key losses...

863
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:34,918
...you could make the semis,
or the finals.

864
01:20:35,129 --> 01:20:38,758
-At least the armor's proven itself.
-And your love?

865
01:20:39,129 --> 01:20:41,245
Have you proven that yet?

866
01:20:43,929 --> 01:20:48,081
Wat, you remember church as a boy.
The fear, the passion.

867
01:20:49,049 --> 01:20:51,119
That's what she makes me feel.

868
01:20:51,929 --> 01:20:56,081
And for that, I say my rosary
to Jocelyn and no one else.

869
01:20:56,889 --> 01:20:59,278
William, that's blasphemous.

870
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,287
Then may I burn in hell.

871
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:08,758
Withdraw.

872
01:21:09,129 --> 01:21:11,279
Lose that way.
Take no more punishment.

873
01:21:11,809 --> 01:21:13,367
Oh, Roland.

874
01:21:19,009 --> 01:21:22,160
My lady sends this message.
If you love her--

875
01:21:22,529 --> 01:21:25,726
I know, I know. I must lose.
Isn't she watching?

876
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:28,882
She says if you love her,
you won't lose again.

877
01:21:29,369 --> 01:21:32,725
She says if you love her,
you will win this tournament.

878
01:21:41,889 --> 01:21:45,199
There she is, the embodiment of love.
Your Venus.

879
01:21:45,449 --> 01:21:46,802
And how I hate her.

880
01:22:02,169 --> 01:22:06,606
-I don't understand women.
-Nor do l, but they understand us.

881
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,681
Maybe not you.

882
01:22:21,289 --> 01:22:22,642
Yes!

883
01:22:23,329 --> 01:22:24,762
Women, eh?

884
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:48,921
Forty-eight...

885
01:22:49,249 --> 01:22:50,568
...forty-nine...

886
01:22:50,849 --> 01:22:52,441
...and fifty.

887
01:22:52,729 --> 01:22:56,119
Thank you, gentlemen.
A pleasure doing business with you.

888
01:22:56,449 --> 01:23:00,078
Look us up if you're in London,
the World Championships, maybe.

889
01:23:00,289 --> 01:23:04,282
Don't look too sad.
Here, have a drink on me.

890
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:09,364
He's quick, he's funny and
makes lots of money, Lichtenstein!

891
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:28,959
Guinevere comes to Lancelot.

892
01:23:34,729 --> 01:23:36,640
Bed him well, my lady.

893
01:23:37,089 --> 01:23:38,568
Bed him well.

894
01:23:45,089 --> 01:23:46,727
We missed you at banquet.

895
01:23:48,249 --> 01:23:49,079
"We"?

896
01:23:53,609 --> 01:23:54,837
I.

897
01:23:56,289 --> 01:23:57,608
Jocelyn.

898
01:23:58,369 --> 01:23:59,961
Your prize.

899
01:24:01,889 --> 01:24:03,447
My prize.

900
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:07,167
I am not worthy of a prize.

901
01:24:09,089 --> 01:24:10,727
Then who is?

902
01:24:12,289 --> 01:24:15,520
My maid tells me that
sometimes your varlets...

903
01:24:16,649 --> 01:24:17,877
...call you William.

904
01:24:21,249 --> 01:24:22,807
Is this so, Sir Ulrich?

905
01:24:26,049 --> 01:24:27,164
Yes.

906
01:24:28,929 --> 01:24:29,884
It is so.

907
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:46,048
Your name makes no matter to me.

908
01:24:47,969 --> 01:24:50,358
Just so I can call you my own.

909
01:24:51,609 --> 01:24:54,169
But Jocelyn, I am your own.

910
01:25:01,249 --> 01:25:02,887
Damn, girl.

911
01:25:03,689 --> 01:25:04,963
You need a surgeon.

912
01:25:05,249 --> 01:25:09,208
He's been. He says I will live,
though it doesn't feel that way.

913
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:13,607
Oh, William. This pain is my doing.

914
01:25:13,929 --> 01:25:15,521
Yes, it is.

915
01:25:19,169 --> 01:25:20,443
Although...

916
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:22,568
...my father...

917
01:25:24,929 --> 01:25:26,999
...taught me to take the bad...

918
01:25:28,009 --> 01:25:29,408
...with the good.

919
01:25:36,449 --> 01:25:38,360
This good you speak of.

920
01:25:41,089 --> 01:25:43,319
It will be my doing as well.

921
01:25:59,649 --> 01:26:03,847
How long since any of you have been
back? I've only been gone 6 months.

922
01:26:04,129 --> 01:26:05,881
Two years for me.

923
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:07,957
Three years.

924
01:26:09,049 --> 01:26:12,439
Five. Five long years.

925
01:26:15,009 --> 01:26:16,283
William?

926
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:19,324
Twelve.

927
01:26:21,089 --> 01:26:22,568
Twelve years.

928
01:26:25,049 --> 01:26:26,562
He's to be an apprentice?

929
01:26:31,169 --> 01:26:32,238
How long for?

930
01:26:33,769 --> 01:26:34,997
Seven years.

931
01:27:07,649 --> 01:27:09,241
Sir Ector?

932
01:27:10,569 --> 01:27:13,879
I'm the thatcher. I spoke to you
outside London Stadium.

933
01:27:14,209 --> 01:27:15,961
Oh, yes. I remember.

934
01:27:16,449 --> 01:27:17,928
Is this the boy?

935
01:27:21,089 --> 01:27:23,523
Step forward, son. Let me look at you.

936
01:27:23,969 --> 01:27:25,880
Careful with that, Roland!

937
01:27:31,169 --> 01:27:33,239
Are you afraid of me, boy?

938
01:27:43,169 --> 01:27:45,364
Have you got most of your teeth?

939
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,919
Show me your arm. Is it strong?

940
01:28:02,729 --> 01:28:05,766
Well, he's a half-starved little
scarecrow.

941
01:28:07,009 --> 01:28:08,761
But he has spirit.

942
01:28:12,449 --> 01:28:16,806
I can show you a great wide world
full of adventure...

943
01:28:17,609 --> 01:28:20,442
...and marvels you
do not yet dream of.

944
01:28:23,009 --> 01:28:25,762
Can you pack my horse and lead it?

945
01:28:32,289 --> 01:28:35,326
Well, come on.
Say goodbye to your father.

946
01:28:36,929 --> 01:28:41,241
He's a real knight, William.
Watch and learn all you can.

947
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:48,959
It's all I can do for you, son.

948
01:28:49,409 --> 01:28:53,243
Now go change your stars
and live a better life than I have.

949
01:29:03,689 --> 01:29:06,567
Roland, show the boy his duties.

950
01:29:10,089 --> 01:29:13,604
-Father? I'm afraid.
-Of what?

951
01:29:14,009 --> 01:29:15,920
I won't know the way home.

952
01:29:16,409 --> 01:29:20,084
Don't be foolish, William.
You just follow your feet.

953
01:29:38,529 --> 01:29:39,598
London.

954
01:30:25,049 --> 01:30:27,279
Give us a shout out, London!

955
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:51,924
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

956
01:31:27,769 --> 01:31:32,684
-Adhemar's here. He's entered.
-Must have grown bored with war.

957
01:31:32,889 --> 01:31:36,723
No, the Black Prince commanded it.
He had to disband his army.

958
01:31:36,969 --> 01:31:39,881
They were reveling,
pillaging town after town.

959
01:31:40,089 --> 01:31:42,842
Robbing, murdering,
ransacking churches.

960
01:31:43,129 --> 01:31:47,122
Committing the oldest sins
in the newest ways.

961
01:31:49,049 --> 01:31:51,961
At last we will face each other again,
Sir Ulrich.

962
01:31:52,249 --> 01:31:53,967
And at the World Championship.

963
01:31:54,169 --> 01:31:56,080
And as I promised you before...

964
01:31:56,409 --> 01:31:59,003
...you will look up at me
from the flat of your back.

965
01:32:04,609 --> 01:32:06,167
Let the past die.

966
01:32:07,129 --> 01:32:10,724
You've done well in my absence,
on the field and off, I'm told.

967
01:32:11,449 --> 01:32:14,839
Winning trophies, horses, women.

968
01:32:16,009 --> 01:32:17,647
You put them in that order?

969
01:32:18,329 --> 01:32:20,923
Generally, with a few exceptions.

970
01:32:27,649 --> 01:32:29,207
Beautiful, isn't she?

971
01:32:29,849 --> 01:32:32,921
A real thoroughbred trophy,
don't you think?

972
01:32:34,009 --> 01:32:37,763
-You speak of her like a target.
-Isn't she?

973
01:32:38,529 --> 01:32:39,644
No.

974
01:32:43,569 --> 01:32:44,968
She is the arrow.

975
01:32:48,929 --> 01:32:51,602
I've begun negotiations
with her father.

976
01:32:55,129 --> 01:32:56,881
I'm to make her my bride.

977
01:32:58,009 --> 01:33:00,398
She'll be saddled...

978
01:33:00,969 --> 01:33:03,119
...and placed on my mantle.

979
01:33:04,089 --> 01:33:06,080
Target or arrow, it doesn't matter.

980
01:33:06,969 --> 01:33:08,607
I will have her.

981
01:33:13,809 --> 01:33:16,004
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

982
01:33:51,649 --> 01:33:55,358
-How would you beat him?
-With a stick, while he slept.

983
01:33:55,929 --> 01:33:58,523
But on a horse? With a lance?

984
01:33:59,289 --> 01:34:01,564
That man is unbeatable.

985
01:34:28,769 --> 01:34:29,884
Hello there.

986
01:34:32,889 --> 01:34:37,007
-You're Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.
-Yes.

987
01:34:37,449 --> 01:34:41,647
You're my favorite knight.
When we joust, I always say I'm you.

988
01:34:42,769 --> 01:34:46,239
What are you doing in Cheapside?
There's no parade today.

989
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:52,207
Can you keep a secret?

990
01:35:07,129 --> 01:35:11,122
I was born in Cheapside,
just around the corner there.

991
01:35:11,449 --> 01:35:14,247
-Truly, Sir Ulrich?
-Truly.

992
01:35:14,529 --> 01:35:16,759
I only live just there.

993
01:35:18,409 --> 01:35:19,728
How old are you?

994
01:35:19,969 --> 01:35:23,006
-Nine and one half.
-Nine and one half.

995
01:35:23,649 --> 01:35:27,562
I wonder if you remember a man,
though he may have died long ago.

996
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:31,284
He was as tall as a knight.
His name was John Thatcher.

997
01:35:31,609 --> 01:35:34,123
-Of course I remember him.
-You do?

998
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:36,399
Yes. He lives there still.

999
01:35:40,889 --> 01:35:44,723
Sometimes we see him sitting
at the window, but no one knows why.

1000
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,444
What do you mean?

1001
01:35:50,009 --> 01:35:51,328
He's blind, sir.

1002
01:36:35,729 --> 01:36:37,242
Is someone there?

1003
01:36:41,849 --> 01:36:46,001
If you're here for the net,
I'm not done yet. Come tomorrow.

1004
01:36:50,129 --> 01:36:51,084
Who are you?

1005
01:36:54,009 --> 01:36:55,078
A knight.

1006
01:36:57,929 --> 01:37:00,921
My name...is Ulrich.

1007
01:37:02,129 --> 01:37:06,122
Ulrich? I hear that name
being chanted from the stadium.

1008
01:37:06,569 --> 01:37:08,366
What business have you here?

1009
01:37:08,849 --> 01:37:11,409
I have word, Master Thatcher.

1010
01:37:13,849 --> 01:37:14,838
Word of your son.

1011
01:37:16,049 --> 01:37:18,961
Of my William? Well, come in, sir.

1012
01:37:24,729 --> 01:37:27,926
What word? Does he live?

1013
01:37:30,209 --> 01:37:31,847
Aye. He lives.

1014
01:37:33,809 --> 01:37:35,401
He is very well.

1015
01:37:37,009 --> 01:37:38,806
He wanted you to know...

1016
01:37:40,569 --> 01:37:42,844
...that he changed his stars
after all.

1017
01:37:52,369 --> 01:37:54,644
And has he followed his feet?

1018
01:37:58,129 --> 01:38:00,643
Has he found his way home at last?

1019
01:38:02,049 --> 01:38:03,004
Yes.

1020
01:38:10,809 --> 01:38:11,878
Father.

1021
01:38:12,209 --> 01:38:14,928
Oh, William. Oh, my boy.

1022
01:38:25,409 --> 01:38:28,640
I should like to meet this Wat.
And Roland too.

1023
01:38:28,849 --> 01:38:30,760
You will, Father.

1024
01:38:33,689 --> 01:38:37,318
And what of women?
ls there a certain one or many?

1025
01:38:39,089 --> 01:38:40,727
There is a certain one.

1026
01:38:42,489 --> 01:38:44,366
I should like to meet her too.

1027
01:38:50,609 --> 01:38:52,839
This leak won't do, Father.

1028
01:38:53,409 --> 01:38:57,960
-Not in a thatcher's chamber.
-It's quite fitting for a blind one.

1029
01:39:00,209 --> 01:39:02,006
Well, a thatcher I am.

1030
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:04,837
I'll fix it.

1031
01:39:47,529 --> 01:39:50,487
Alive. I thought he was dead,
which is mad...

1032
01:39:50,729 --> 01:39:53,846
...because he was also so strong.
Very strong.

1033
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:56,366
-Geoff.
-Jocelyn.

1034
01:39:56,689 --> 01:39:59,044
This day just gets better and better.

1035
01:40:01,889 --> 01:40:03,004
Somebody die?

1036
01:40:06,129 --> 01:40:08,040
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

1037
01:40:11,609 --> 01:40:12,837
Adhemar...

1038
01:40:13,809 --> 01:40:17,165
...followed you last night.
To Cheapside.

1039
01:40:17,889 --> 01:40:19,163
He saw your father.

1040
01:40:20,369 --> 01:40:23,008
Will, they asked me for your patents.

1041
01:40:27,409 --> 01:40:30,560
They're waiting for you
in the lists to arrest you.

1042
01:40:31,409 --> 01:40:33,001
A dozen royal guards.

1043
01:40:34,129 --> 01:40:38,919
-They'll put you in the stocks.
-But I face Adhemar in five minutes.

1044
01:40:40,369 --> 01:40:44,044
No, you forfeit.
They've already marked it down.

1045
01:40:45,169 --> 01:40:48,366
Saddle the horses.
They can arrest your baggage, not you.

1046
01:40:54,289 --> 01:40:55,768
Halt.

1047
01:41:00,849 --> 01:41:02,487
So, what do you think...

1048
01:41:04,889 --> 01:41:06,720
...now that you know what I am?

1049
01:41:08,049 --> 01:41:12,042
To know what you are, William,
would take a lifetime.

1050
01:41:12,689 --> 01:41:15,408
One I am willing to give.
But now you must run.

1051
01:41:17,169 --> 01:41:19,399
Run, and I will run with you.

1052
01:41:19,729 --> 01:41:21,640
Jocelyn, I cannot run.

1053
01:41:21,969 --> 01:41:25,325
I am a knight, and I will
put myself to the hazard!

1054
01:41:25,689 --> 01:41:29,318
In your heart, not on paper.
And paper's what matters to them!

1055
01:41:32,369 --> 01:41:34,405
William, I love you.

1056
01:41:36,369 --> 01:41:38,644
I love you. You.

1057
01:41:41,009 --> 01:41:45,400
-I won't see you led to the stocks.
-But you'll see me run? No!

1058
01:41:46,609 --> 01:41:48,520
Damn your pride, William.

1059
01:41:49,009 --> 01:41:51,728
It is only you that
will not see you run.

1060
01:41:51,969 --> 01:41:54,119
Pride's the one thing they can't take!

1061
01:41:54,369 --> 01:41:57,759
But they can take it from you.
They can and they will.

1062
01:41:58,489 --> 01:41:59,922
Oh, they will.

1063
01:42:00,689 --> 01:42:02,919
But love they cannot take.

1064
01:42:08,049 --> 01:42:10,279
And where will we live?

1065
01:42:11,409 --> 01:42:12,842
In my hovel?

1066
01:42:14,489 --> 01:42:19,609
-With the pigs inside in winter?
-Yes, William, with the pigs.

1067
01:42:19,809 --> 01:42:21,083
With the pigs.

1068
01:42:24,049 --> 01:42:25,641
The poor can marry for love.

1069
01:42:27,409 --> 01:42:30,128
Jocelyn, you speak of what
you do not know!

1070
01:42:33,849 --> 01:42:35,760
William, I beg you.

1071
01:42:36,529 --> 01:42:37,803
Please.

1072
01:42:40,209 --> 01:42:41,881
Run. Do it for love.

1073
01:42:49,609 --> 01:42:51,247
Roland, you would see me run?

1074
01:42:57,969 --> 01:42:59,084
And you, Geoff?

1075
01:42:59,889 --> 01:43:02,642
I wish it too, with all
the pieces of my heart.

1076
01:43:08,689 --> 01:43:11,726
Wat? You and l? We aren't runners.

1077
01:43:16,209 --> 01:43:17,324
Yes.

1078
01:43:19,249 --> 01:43:20,921
William, today we are.

1079
01:43:24,209 --> 01:43:25,528
Run, William.

1080
01:43:32,049 --> 01:43:34,005
I will not run!

1081
01:43:41,009 --> 01:43:42,488
I am a knight.

1082
01:43:54,929 --> 01:43:56,203
Well, boys...

1083
01:43:56,769 --> 01:43:59,078
...all good things must come to an end.

1084
01:43:59,969 --> 01:44:01,800
Let's end them together.

1085
01:44:37,569 --> 01:44:41,039
You will remove yourself
from this position of honor.

1086
01:44:43,049 --> 01:44:44,323
I am here to compete.

1087
01:44:44,729 --> 01:44:47,004
You are here to be arrested.

1088
01:44:54,169 --> 01:44:55,443
All right!

1089
01:45:22,689 --> 01:45:25,203
He that strives to touch a star...

1090
01:45:26,049 --> 01:45:27,641
...oft stumbles...

1091
01:45:27,969 --> 01:45:29,561
...at a simple straw.

1092
01:45:40,089 --> 01:45:41,727
You have been weighed.

1093
01:45:49,049 --> 01:45:50,687
You have been measured.

1094
01:45:53,569 --> 01:45:55,207
And you have been found wanting.

1095
01:46:00,609 --> 01:46:03,442
It's one loss or another...William.

1096
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:12,884
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1097
01:46:49,609 --> 01:46:51,008
Leave, Roland.

1098
01:46:52,049 --> 01:46:53,323
Let them have me.

1099
01:46:54,289 --> 01:46:56,041
God love you, William.

1100
01:46:56,409 --> 01:46:57,762
So do l.

1101
01:46:58,329 --> 01:47:00,399
Go! Disperse!

1102
01:47:02,609 --> 01:47:04,167
Or I will fong you!

1103
01:47:04,729 --> 01:47:07,562
As Jesus Christ the Nazarene
and his holy mother...

1104
01:47:07,809 --> 01:47:11,199
...the Virgin Mary are my witnesses,
I will fong you!

1105
01:47:12,089 --> 01:47:14,683
I will rip you! Fist! Pain!

1106
01:47:15,049 --> 01:47:19,042
I'll stick my fist and break you!
Pain! Lots of pain!

1107
01:47:25,049 --> 01:47:26,402
We're in trouble.

1108
01:47:30,009 --> 01:47:31,601
Listen to me.

1109
01:47:36,089 --> 01:47:38,000
Listen to me!

1110
01:48:09,369 --> 01:48:11,644
What a pair we make, huh?

1111
01:48:15,009 --> 01:48:17,045
Both trying to hide who we are.

1112
01:48:18,329 --> 01:48:19,603
Both unable to do so.

1113
01:48:28,249 --> 01:48:30,001
Your men love you.

1114
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:35,126
If I knew nothing else about you,
that would be enough.

1115
01:48:36,609 --> 01:48:40,238
But you also tilt
when you should withdraw.

1116
01:48:42,649 --> 01:48:44,480
That is knightly too.

1117
01:48:52,409 --> 01:48:53,558
Release him.

1118
01:49:03,129 --> 01:49:06,007
He may appear to be
of humble origins...

1119
01:49:07,209 --> 01:49:10,167
...but my personal historians
have discovered...

1120
01:49:10,489 --> 01:49:13,959
...that he descends
from an ancient royal line.

1121
01:49:17,209 --> 01:49:18,847
This is my word.

1122
01:49:20,249 --> 01:49:23,605
And as such, is beyond contestation.

1123
01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:29,639
Now...

1124
01:49:30,969 --> 01:49:34,166
...if I may repay the kindness
you once showed me.

1125
01:49:35,449 --> 01:49:36,404
Take a knee.

1126
01:49:52,769 --> 01:49:56,603
By the power vested in me
by my father, King Edward...

1127
01:49:57,729 --> 01:50:00,084
...and by all the witnesses here...

1128
01:50:03,129 --> 01:50:04,403
...l dub thee...

1129
01:50:07,009 --> 01:50:08,237
...Sir William.

1130
01:50:20,009 --> 01:50:22,477
Arise...Sir William.

1131
01:50:29,569 --> 01:50:30,797
Can you joust?

1132
01:50:32,409 --> 01:50:34,320
There's my tournament to finish.

1133
01:50:34,809 --> 01:50:39,121
Now, are you fit to compete,
or shall the forfeit stand?

1134
01:50:39,929 --> 01:50:40,839
I'm fit.

1135
01:50:42,169 --> 01:50:46,879
I shall have your opponent informed.
Look for his shield on the lists.

1136
01:50:47,449 --> 01:50:48,723
At once.

1137
01:50:49,369 --> 01:50:50,722
Thank you, my lord.

1138
01:51:00,769 --> 01:51:03,124
All hail Prince Edward!

1139
01:51:07,929 --> 01:51:10,159
My lords, my ladies...

1140
01:51:11,009 --> 01:51:13,364
...and all you other people.

1141
01:51:14,169 --> 01:51:18,685
I give you the son of Philippe
de Vitry, son of Gilles....

1142
01:51:21,209 --> 01:51:23,120
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1143
01:51:23,809 --> 01:51:26,687
It's nothing but spun sugar
and boot black.

1144
01:51:35,289 --> 01:51:36,802
It's a small target...

1145
01:51:38,489 --> 01:51:40,081
...but aim for his heart.

1146
01:51:46,009 --> 01:51:48,159
--doer of daring deeds...

1147
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:52,600
...conqueror of countless kingdoms,
Count...

1148
01:51:56,249 --> 01:51:57,841
...Adhemar!

1149
01:53:38,689 --> 01:53:40,600
Oh, God. I'll get the surgeon.

1150
01:53:40,889 --> 01:53:41,878
Roland!

1151
01:53:42,409 --> 01:53:43,558
You're the surgeon.

1152
01:53:45,889 --> 01:53:46,958
Come on.

1153
01:53:54,409 --> 01:53:55,444
He tipped it.

1154
01:53:58,169 --> 01:54:00,239
Kate, get me back to one.

1155
01:54:00,609 --> 01:54:02,486
Otherwise we forfeit.

1156
01:54:09,369 --> 01:54:11,439
Dirty son of a bitch!

1157
01:55:18,809 --> 01:55:22,006
Kate, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1158
01:55:28,409 --> 01:55:30,479
As I said, thatcher.

1159
01:55:32,609 --> 01:55:35,442
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1160
01:55:36,089 --> 01:55:37,966
Such a place does not exist.

1161
01:55:40,289 --> 01:55:41,927
She's here William.

1162
01:55:44,009 --> 01:55:45,044
With your father.

1163
01:55:49,369 --> 01:55:50,882
Change your stars.

1164
01:55:55,729 --> 01:55:57,447
Let's dance, you and l.

1165
01:56:01,049 --> 01:56:02,687
It's two lances to none.

1166
01:56:02,969 --> 01:56:06,484
You must unhorse him or kill him.
It's the only way to win.

1167
01:56:16,089 --> 01:56:18,842
-You need more padding.
-No, leave it off.

1168
01:56:19,449 --> 01:56:21,041
I can't breathe with it on.

1169
01:56:26,489 --> 01:56:27,558
Lance.

1170
01:56:32,769 --> 01:56:34,248
I can barely grip it.

1171
01:56:34,489 --> 01:56:35,763
Damn.

1172
01:56:42,169 --> 01:56:43,443
Lash it to my arm.

1173
01:56:47,449 --> 01:56:48,598
Wat...

1174
01:56:49,289 --> 01:56:50,768
...lash it to me arm.

1175
01:56:53,809 --> 01:56:54,798
Do it.

1176
01:57:12,329 --> 01:57:13,808
Good people!

1177
01:57:14,809 --> 01:57:16,083
I missed my introduction!

1178
01:57:26,809 --> 01:57:28,401
But please...

1179
01:57:28,729 --> 01:57:30,321
...please, I pray you.

1180
01:57:30,809 --> 01:57:32,242
Hear it now.

1181
01:57:33,569 --> 01:57:35,446
For I would lay rest...

1182
01:57:35,769 --> 01:57:37,999
...the grace in my tongue...

1183
01:57:38,329 --> 01:57:39,921
...and speak plain.

1184
01:57:41,049 --> 01:57:42,801
Days like these...

1185
01:57:43,129 --> 01:57:46,644
...are far too rare to cheapen
with heavy-handed words.

1186
01:57:47,929 --> 01:57:51,638
And so, I'm afraid,
without any ado whatsoever--

1187
01:57:52,249 --> 01:57:53,568
Excuse me, my lord.

1188
01:57:54,009 --> 01:57:57,206
Here he is! One of your own!

1189
01:57:58,169 --> 01:58:00,967
Born a stone's throw from
this very stadium...

1190
01:58:01,289 --> 01:58:03,041
...and here before you now.

1191
01:58:03,369 --> 01:58:05,280
The son of John Thatcher...

1192
01:58:06,249 --> 01:58:09,127
...Sir William Thatcher!

1193
01:58:19,809 --> 01:58:20,798
That's your name.

1194
01:58:23,649 --> 01:58:25,560
Sir William Thatcher.

1195
01:58:26,329 --> 01:58:27,682
Your father heard that.

1196
01:58:45,049 --> 01:58:46,687
Godspeed, William.

1197
01:59:55,729 --> 01:59:58,323
William!

1198
02:00:18,489 --> 02:00:20,400
You have been weighed.

1199
02:00:21,809 --> 02:00:22,958
You've been measured.

1200
02:00:26,009 --> 02:00:28,079
And you absolutely...

1201
02:00:28,729 --> 02:00:30,321
...have been found wanting.

1202
02:00:34,329 --> 02:00:36,081
Welcome to the new world.

1203
02:00:36,609 --> 02:00:39,965
God save you, if it is right
that he should do so.

1204
02:00:46,289 --> 02:00:48,325
William!

1205
02:01:01,889 --> 02:01:03,481
Yes!

1206
02:01:04,849 --> 02:01:06,362
He's won! He's won!

1207
02:01:40,009 --> 02:01:41,601
You beat him, Will!

1208
02:01:46,089 --> 02:01:47,442
Oh, William.

1209
02:02:07,209 --> 02:02:09,120
I'm going to write this story.

1210
02:02:09,409 --> 02:02:11,320
About the prince and the knights?

1211
02:02:11,569 --> 02:02:16,324
No, all of it. All human activity
lies within the artist's scope.

1212
02:02:18,729 --> 02:02:20,481
Maybe not yours.

1213
