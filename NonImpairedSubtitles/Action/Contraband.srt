Mardi Gras jewelry,

306

Well, I got
something coming in.

1060
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:05,601
You don't sound so sure.

1061
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:07,227
I'm sure.
It's coming in.

Flying solo ain't

I fucking warned you.

1064
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:17,863
When you first
came to me for help

1065
01:09:17,946 --> 01:09:19,948
in keeping your
little business afloat,

1066
01:09:20,032 --> 01:09:22,326
I fucking warned you.

1067
01:09:22,534 --> 01:09:25,537
I said, "You've got to
know your limitations."

1068
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:28,457
"Don't live beyond
your fucking means!"

1069
01:09:31,794 --> 01:09:33,921
I don't normally
do this fucking shit.

1070
01:09:35,047 --> 01:09:37,508
Telling you what's going to
happen when you don't pay.

1071
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:40,469
What's the fucking point?
You know the rules, right?

1072
01:09:41,512 --> 01:09:42,763
Right.

1073
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:53,273

I want you to go see Kate.

Man, I thought
she was your family.

He's going to dump the package.

It's going to work.
You think so?

1089

Did you take science
in school, Tarik?

1090

Yeah.

1091

So, you'll be all

I'm going to be
perfectly fucking clear.

You call your husband and you tell
him not to dump it in the water!

You tell him that you, Michael and
