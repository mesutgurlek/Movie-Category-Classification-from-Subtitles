you could lose everything you've ever

I'm the go-between for
the court and the accused.

309
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,632
For a 10% fee,

310
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,473
I will guarantee the amount
set by the court.

Now...

312
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,560
if the defendant should fail to appear

313
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,471
at his or her court date,

314
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,838
I will bring in a bounty hunter
to recapture the defendant,

315
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,469
or I will face having to repay
the court costs myself,

or the guarantee
given to the bondsman

320
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,394
turns out to be worthless
or difficult to liquidate.

321
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,436
So... in layman's terms,

322
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,035
we get 10% of the bail.

323

In the meantime, feel free to take
a coffee break, pee break, whatever.

327
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,120
We'll be starting
in the next few minutes.

328

[Light applause]

329
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,757
Hey, how about it? Want to ride
some bounty hunter cock?

330
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,310
- Fuck you, dickhead.
- Ooh. Bitch!

331
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,039
Excuse the fuck out of us!

332
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,031
We got to ditch this thing.

333
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,511
Gentlemen...

334
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,875
it has been a pleasure.

335
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,795
All right, bathroom window, 5 minutes.

336
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,996
I'll keep the engine running.

337
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,509
Domino: Nobody really knows
where Ed came from.

338
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,239
This much is clear...
the man's been places,

339
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,039
seen things, lived life.

340
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,588
He did a term in Soledad
and a term in Angola,

341
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,513
where he lost a toe during a prison riot.

342
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,989
The man's a warrior.

343

[Window hinges squeak]

345
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,589
Domino: To say that Choco is
the product of a broken home

346
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,148
is to presume a home existed
in the first place.

347
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,028
No. Choco never had a home.
Well, not unless you count

348
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,872
10 or so juvenile
correction facilities,

349
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,871
where he spent his childhood.

350
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,751
Mierda! Damn!

351
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,838
Goddamn!

352
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,230
Puta...

353
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,437
- What the fuck is this?
- Where the fuck are you going?

354
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,954
Those people paid for a seminar!

[Distant siren]

356

Where do you get off
fucking up my windshield?

357
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,914
I want a job!

358
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,195
Jesus fuckin' Christ, lady.

359
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,714
Everybody wants a goddamn job.

360
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,751
What makes you think you
can do this one, huh?

361
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,348
I've been training since I was 12.

362
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,590
Knives, guns, throwing stars.

363
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,116
You name it, I can fight with it.
I'm a hard worker. I'm a hard worker.

364
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,478
I'm fast to learn, and nothing scares me.
I'm not afraid to die.

365
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,556
Why would a...

366
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,031
delicate little thing like you
want to be a goddamn bounty hunter?

367
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,673
I want to have a little fun.

368
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,310
You want to have a little fun?

369
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,354
Well, little girl, you want a job?

370
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,158
Yeah.

371
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,712
It's gonna cost you a new windshield.

372
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,156
You know what? Enough of that
"little girl" shit. The name is Domino.

373
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,917
Domino.

374
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,716
- Domino what?
- No, just Domino.

375
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,910
Let's take a ride.

376
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,989
Qué?

377
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,156
The kid's name is Hector Maldonado,
19 years old.

378
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,037
His mother posted bail for him,
after he was arrested for a drive-by.

379
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,391
[Speaking Spanish]

380
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,392
He speaks perfect fuckin' English.
He just thinks it's cute

381
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,914
when he's around
a good-looking woman.

383

Hey. Yeah, listen.

384
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,309
Louise, listen,
you can make this easy,

385
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,755
or you can make it real complicated.

386
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,519
Domino: For $200, Louise gave us
her boyfriend's whereabouts

387
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,910
at the local gangbanger hangout
across the street.

388
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,550
What's his problem?

389
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,474
Latin petulance. Hold on.
Give me a minute with him.

390
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,756
All right, come on,
princess, spit it out.

391
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,917
Why do we need that bitch on the
team? You don't like what I'm doing?

392
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,992
- I can hear you.
- [Speaking Spanish]

Hey, baby, why don't you take a walk
and let me handle this?

394
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,390
First, she ain't on the team yet.

395
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,118
OK?

396
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,589
Second of all,

397
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,636
take a look at her.

398
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,360
I mean, come on, man, she ain't ugly.

399
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,036
You and I walk down the street,
what do people see?

400
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,031
A couple of losers, right?

401
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,749
We add her to the equation, you know
what people are gonna think?

402
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,716
What?

403
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,237
There goes two of the coolest
motherfuckers who ever lived. Hmm?

404
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,351
You know what?
I don't know about you, man, but...

405
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,477
I'm already
a cool motherfucker, you know?

406
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,154
Sometimes you got
your own tongue up your ass.

407
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,913
Little fuckin' pendejo.

408

coursing through my veins.

409

Merry Christmas.
Did you ever use one of these?

410
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,992
Ever heard of the
Beverly Hills Gun Club?

411
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,998
Domino: Shotgun in hand,
kicking down a door and wondering

412
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,150
if there was heavy firepower
on the other side.

413
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,470
Domino, you cover the side.

414

Choco, you cover the rear.

On my word.

Domino: Turns out...

417
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,798
my first raid was to be
a near-disaster.

418
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,990
That bitch Louise set us up.

419
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,116
Hector was hiding underneath
her bed all along.

- Hurry! There's 3 po-pos out front!

428
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,158
Life or death.

This ain't Sunset Boulevard.

430
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,953
My destiny was life.

431
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,440
Life as a bounty hunter.

432
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,310
Put that shit down, homey!

What the fuck you doin', bitch?!
Step back, motherfucker!

What the fuck you want?

435
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,037
We're not cops. We're bounty hunters.
All we want is Hector.

436
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,315
Fuck you and the fuckin' po-pos, bitch!

You tell me where he is,
and I'll give you...

Domino: Sometimes a girl has to be
naughty to get herself out of a jam.

440

I'll give you a lap dance.

Man, fuck you, bitch!

442
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,039
I'll give you a lap dance,
bra and panties on.

443

Man, if I wanted all that,
I'd go to a strip joint, motherfucker.

Come on, you and me.

You know you want it.

Hey, what do you think, dawg?

447
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,036
I want to see what the fuck
this bitch is workin' with.

448

- I'm offering it to you, baby. Come on.
- Is that right?

Well, take off your clothes, bitch.

Domino: It worked.

455
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,678
We got the scoop
on how to find Hector.

456
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,751
2 weeks later, we nailed him.

457
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,755
Domino: Claremont was Charlie
to our three Angels.

458
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,152
It's very simple. The, um...
DMV is the de facto conduit

459
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,992
for all humanity,

460
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,911
and every human being
that we track down

461
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,798
has a record in the DMV database.

462
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,270
Uh, whether it be LAPD,
Social Services,

463
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,078
the Credit Bureau, or the FBI,

464
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,549
they all use the DMV's database
as their hub.

465
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,712
So, we have people on the inside
who feed us the information.

466
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,518
This one right there.

467
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,718
Ohh, shit. And who would know it?

468
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,794
The gatekeepers of humanity turn out
to be a bunch of sassy black women.

Excuse me?

470
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,356
He said he liked your suit.

471

- Tell him what you said.
- I like your suit.

472
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,829
Domino: After 6 months,
Claremont hired Alf to drive us around.

473
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,354
We were so busy.

474
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,640
Little did I know that the FBI liked
to keep tabs on us bounty hunters.

475
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,510
Ed, what did you do
before you were a bounty hunter?

476
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,956
I played music. I was a musician.

477
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,473
Really?

478
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,391
What, in a band?

479
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,231
Did you ever hear
of Stevie Ray Vaughan?

480
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,390
Wait, you're shitting me.

481
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,959
Stevie and I hlooked up in Austin.

482
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,436
Back in the day,
we did the bus tour thing together.

483
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,196
Played every goddamn

He was standing there

00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,990
that she's in the Guinness
Book of World Records

643
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,755
for being America's
youngest grandmother.

644
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,150
And... she's only 28.

645
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,356
Please welcome Lateesha Rodriguez!

646
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,193
Domino: Lateesha was
our prime contact at the DMV.

647
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,716
Most of our bond certificates
came from Claremont through her.

648
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,711
[Crowd cheering]

649
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,077
- Hey, Jerry!
- Hey, Lateesha. How are you?

650
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,798
- I'm fine.
- What's going on?

651
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,077
I'm here today to speak
for all people of mixed race in America.

652
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,835
Now, as a blactino woman, I believe
we deserve our own race category

653
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,593
to forge an identity, Jerry.
That's how I feel.

654
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,875
Did you just say "blactino"?

655
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,916
Yes, I did. I'm a blactino-American.

656
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,752
Wow. Uh, first of all...

657
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,796
first of all, you don't even look latino.

658
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,950
You look black.
You're... You're black.

659
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,952
Second of all, I'm of mixed race,
and I've struggled my whole life

660
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,235
as to whether I'm Chinese
or whether I'm black.

661
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,629
Chinegro! What you are is chinegro!

662
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,870
- Chinegro?
- Chinegro! There you go!

663
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,951
- Chinegro?
- You are a chinegro!

664
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,352
- What the [bleep] is chinegro?
- That's what you are! Chinegro is you!

665
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,670
That's some bulls... [bleep].

666
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,116
OK, as I understand it, you brought
a mixed-race flow chart with you.

667
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,998
Why don't we bring that out?
[Crowd shouting and booing]

668
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,109
How you doin', sugar? All right.
I'm gonna call you later.

669
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,555
Mwah. All right.

670
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,709
[Crowd laughs]

671
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,233
Take a look at this...

672
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,869
Blactino, blackasian, hispasian, OK?

673
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,918
Now, for the Asian subcategories,
I got you, sister.

674
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,912
We have chinegro right here.
That's you. Chinegro.

675
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,036
That's not a word! That's not a word!

676
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,193
Yes, it is, sister.
We have koreagro. Japegro, OK?

677
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,998
[Crowd laughs]

678
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,231
Chispanic, koreaspanic,
and last but not least,

679
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,312
check this out, y'all... japanic.
[Crowd cheering]

680
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,510
That's how I flow with it!

681
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,354
Do you believe the government should
recognise these racial subgroups?

682
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,839
Yes, Jerry, I do.

683
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,114
Hey, wait!

684
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,873
First of all, first of all,
uh-uh, honey, let me tell you,

685
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,633
from one, uh, blactino woman
to another...

686
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,995
- Right on.
- Our concern is education!

687
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,277
You ever hear of that?! Here you are,
a 28-year-old grandmother!

688
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,112
Yes, I am.

689
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,191
You need to add another category
to your flow chart.

690
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,716
It's called birth control, bitch!
[Crowd shouting and booing]

691
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,629
OK, yeah. Check this out.

692
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,836
I am educated, you blactino bitch!

693
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,069
What?!

694
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,197
I'm a Devry graduate! And, yes,
my daughter might be a single mother...

695
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,114
- I'll kick your ass! I'll kick your ass!
- Bring it, bitch!

696
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,318
Crowd: Jerry! Jerry!
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

697
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,556
- Come on, Bri. We're late, we're late.
- Dude, it's fucking Mapquest.

698
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,551
I told you, never again
with that piece of shit.

699
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,073
Guys.

700
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,033
Come meet Domino.

701
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,908
Domino, I want you to meet
the co-hosts of Bounty Squad.

702
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,910
[Gunshot]

703
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,878
Domino: Fucking... fucking... fucking...

704
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,794
fucking 90210.
I couldn't get away from it.

705
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,791
It wasn't until later on that I realised

706
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,792
Mum had gotten to Heiss
and pulled some strings.

707
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,632
Lan Ziering.

708
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,872
Brian Austin Green. Domino.

709
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,438
Cocoa... Choco.

710
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,590
- Cocoa?
- Choco.

711
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,398
Choco. Sorry.

712
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,198
The man from Afghanistan

713
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,909
has made some significant
changes to the RV.

714
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,232
Oh, my God.

715
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,390
[Engine revs]

716
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,719
Are those real bones?

717
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,234
Monkey... monkey bones?

718
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,195
Shrunken heads?

719
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,271
From my family.

720
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,438
I drive these bounty hunters
for a free Afghanistan.

721
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,274
Wow. I didn't know
this was gonna be a political show.

722
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,275
Domino: Alf grew up during the Russian
invasion of Afghanistan.

723
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,156
He had always wanted to be
part of the revolution

724
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,954
but it seemed to pass him by.

725
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,996
[Horn honks]

726
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,557
At the tender age of 14,

727
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,632
he decided that explosives
would be his speciality.

728
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,199
[Shouting]

729
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,955
Domino: His eyebrows
never grew back.

730
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,829
OK, Ed, uh...

731
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,434
What background should someone have
if they want to go into bounty hunting?

732
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,795
How does jail sound?

733
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,190
So, tell me, do you boys hunt?

734
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,510
I killed a... I killed a squirrel...

735
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,992
once.

736
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,029
Well, let me tell you something.
Once you hunt a human being,

737
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,554
you'll never hunt an animal again.

738
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,551
You know, it's a different kind of rush.

739
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,394
The problem is, is that when
you've done it for as long as I have,

740
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,311
all you got to show for it is

741
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,949
an empty bank account and, uh, IBS.

742
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,397
- IBS?
- Yeah, that's irritable bowel syndrome.

743
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,076
You got a spastic colon?
That's hysterical.

744
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,230
You know, my grandmother
has one of those.

745
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,311
Does your grandmother hunt?

746
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,800
Uh, well, I don't know. Maybe.

747
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,151
Why don't you just
shut the fuck up, huh?

748
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,038
You were supposed to talk about
the healthcare crisis!

749
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,714
Exactly. Why would you use
Jerry Springer

750
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,873
as a platform for some kind of
progressive race modification proposal?

751
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,793
Well, I don't think Ted Koppel
would blook Lateesha Rodriguez!

752
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,555
- Not a chance.
- Not a chance in hell. Hmm.

753
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,029
OK, Jerry is one of the only forums
our people have, baby.

754
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,918
I thought having time on Springer
would give me a chance

755
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,595
of gettin' a blook deal
or a correspondence gig on BET.

756
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,113
Jenny Jones bitch got cancelled.

757
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,430
Yeah, Montel would've been better.

758
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,277
Domino: Lateesha's granddaughter
Mika had a rare blood disease.

759
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,158
Her white cell count was dropping fast.

760
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,798
Dad?

761
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,110
We need money.

762
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,872
I got an idea.

763
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,393
What?

764
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,198
Armoured car business.

765
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,389
We just signed a new
insurance policy in Nevada.

766
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,357
There's a loophole.

767
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,637
Domino: Claremont Williams,
bail bondsman,

768
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,759
armoured car service,
bounty hunter service.

769
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,115
An unusual combination.

770
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,351
Kee Kee, me and Claremont

771
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,637
are working on a plan
to get money for Mika.

772
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,197
A real good plan, baby... a good plan.

773
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,430
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez
has been running

774
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,351
a counterfeit driver's licence racket?

775
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,749
Well, that's the word on the street.

776
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,670
You drove Lateesha's daughter
to school,

777
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,752
then dropped her off
at the DMV. Why?

778
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,035
Her car was in the shop.

779
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,470
How convenient. The morning
you call in sick, I turn on the TV

780
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,075
and see you all over Jerry Springer.

781
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,229
[People shouting]

782
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,634
- Never heard of TiVo?
- Think I can afford it?

783
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,995
Give me a break, Pat.
What do you want?

784
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,516
I got a call yesterday from
our health care provider.

785
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,068
They said you tried to pass your
granddaughter off as Kee Kee

786
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,799
down at City Terrace
Community Hospital.

787
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,634
They said you forged the age on the
application for some sort of operation.

788
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,156
Motherfuckin' HMOs
don't cover grandchildren.

789
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,518
That fuckin' operation is $300,000.
Where am I gonna get the money, Pat?

790
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,310
You should've thought about that
before you became a grandmother.

791
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,436
Fuck you.

792
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,756
You got 2 weeks to clear out your desk.

793
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,673
Domino: It just kept
getting worse for Lateesha.

794
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,991
- What?
- Did I stutter? 2 weeks.

795
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,319
Domino: No one could've
expected what happened next.

796
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,428
Oh, by the way, there are a couple of
FBI agents here that want to talk to you.

797
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,916
Woman: You're gonna go to jail
for a long, long time, Lateesha.

798
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,357
Man:
Unless you cooperate with us.

799
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,273
Domino: Their names
were Cosgrove and Wilson.

800
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,113
Someone had tipped them off
to Lateesha's counterfeit scam,

801
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,668
but that's not what
they were really after.

802
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,398
I'm listening.

803
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,789
In about 10 minutes,
a college kid named Frances

804
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,475
is gonna walk up to your window
and ask for 4 counterfeit IDs.

805
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,393
You could help us out here.

806
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,869
Lateesha, we want
to know what he's up to.

807
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,999
I mean, look at you. You got your hair
did, your nails lookin' all good.

808
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,992
You go to jail, that's all gonna go away.

809
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,275
- Won't see your kids for a long time.
- Think about it.

810
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,430
It's gonna be long as hell.

811
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,958
Domino: This was when Lateesha
decided to do something foolish,

812
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,237
and Frances was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

813
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,719
OK.

814
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,075
OK. He and three of his friends
are gonna hijack an armoured truck.

815
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,910
They're gonna walk away
with 10 million in cash.

816
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,911
10 million. Hmm.

817
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,550
PA: Now serving G086.

818
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,908
Hey.

819
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,799
[Siren blares]

820
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,838
Weatherman: Sunshine, that's for sure.
We should be at 76 degrees,

821
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,992
the downtown area barely breaking
that 70-degree mark.

822
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,550
66 was the high yesterday. Overnight
lows dropping down to 48 degrees.

823
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,870
All right, y'all, Lateesha done...

824
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,997
Lateesha done dug herself a deep hole,

825
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,436
and, uh, she can't get out by herself.

826
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,351
Can y'all dig what I'm saying?

827
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,557
Mija, we're in a hole together.
We dig together. We're a team.

828
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,473
Just like Billy Ocean says:
"When the going gets tough..."

829
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,790
"the tough get going."

830
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,634
Domino: There are 3 kinds
of people in this world...

831
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,551
the rich,

832
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,473
the poor, and everyone in between.

833
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,120
Think you're having a tough day?
You should see this.

834
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,270
I got an armoured truck that's empty.
Yeah.

835
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,920
I think Mr Wonderful is pulling up now.

836
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,954
Domino: That's Drake Bishop, owner
of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino.

837
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,999
He's worth a billion dollars,
10 million of it recently stolen.

838
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,469
His attorney, Burke Beckett.

839
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,279
- I'm Detective Chris Cudlitz.
- We know who you are.

840
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,349
Where's my money?

841
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,318
I think it's probably best
if we take a look at the tapes.

842
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,389
Cudlitz: Our tapes show
that at 6:23am,

843
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,712
your truck pulls into the parking lot
and turns the engine off.

844
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,633
- Rewind, please.
- Rewind the tape.

845
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,758
- Freeze the tape.
- Freeze the tape.

846
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,279
- Now, can you zoom in?
- Zoom in, please.

847
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,715
You a fucking mockingbird?
Shut the fuck up!

848
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,392
I just...

849
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,191
- Nancy Reagan.
- I think that's Hillary Clinton.

850
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,909
- Fat ankles.
- It's Barbara fucking Bush.

851
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,719
And Jacqueline Onassis
just to her left.

852
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,110
Christ almighty, it's the goddamned
First Ladies.

853
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,309
If you don't mind me
asking you, Mr Bishop,

854
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,391
what exactly is in those tan duffel bags?

855
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,314
- You don't have to answer that.
- Shut up, Burke. $10 million, cash.

856
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,153
Don't tell me it was a fucking hijacking.

857
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,474
How'd you get me
in this position, Burke?

858
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,438
Mr. Bishop?
You have an urgent telephone call, sir.

859
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,272
Yeah. Bishop.

860
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,790
Bishop, this is Claremont Williams.

861
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,190
I own the Williams Brothers
Armoured Car Service.

862
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,395
Yeah.

863
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,948
Um, hold on a minute, please.

864
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,435
[Static]

865
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,590
[Agents chatter]

866
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,908
Let me isolate it.

867
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,315
Yesterday I received
an e-mail from a source.

868
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,994
In this e-mail were
four social security numbers

869
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,640
made to counterfeit
California driver's licences.

870
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,914
And?

871
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,514
I believe these are the gentlemen
who robbed us, sir.

872
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,637
I'm also a bail bondsman
out of Los Angeles,

873
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,633
and I can track down and deliver these
thieves to you for a small finder's fee.

874
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,951
- How much?
- Just $300,000.

875
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,798
And what happens
if you don't deliver?

876
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,873
My theft insurance policy
will have to fork over that $10 million.

877
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,791
That will take 6-8 months.

878
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,394
But you should know, sir,
that I employ bounty hunters,

879
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,677
and my bounty hunters can and will
track down these thieves.

880
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,548
Well, you deliver these crooks to me
and you've got yourself a deal...

881
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,834
300,000.

882
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,195
Thank you, sir. That's a deal.

883
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,313
Domino: Crime boss Anthony Cigliutti.

884
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,713
Bishop's attorney had put his boss
in business with the mob.

885
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,438
They're asking for a finder's fee.

886
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,318
Finder's fee? That's bullshit.

887
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,595
Sounds like an inside job to me.

888
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,148
Could be. Who knows
if this Claremont Williams

889
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,958
is in on the heist or not.

890
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,396
All I know, if this joker
delivers the First Ladies,

891
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,233
we'll split the 300,000 fee with you.

892
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,349
All right, gentlemen.
Sounds like we got a little situation here.

893
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,118
Domino: Quite a mess indeed.

894
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,478
Beckett had just brokered
an underhanded deal with Cigliutti.

895
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,313
The 10 million,
en route from LA to Vegas,

896
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,833
belonged to the mob.

897
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,277
Bishop's clean reputation was a great
cover for laundered cash.

898
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,998
If the FBI could link
the two men together,

899
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,310
it would be the takedown of the century.

Domino: Locus Fender was brought in
to drive the armoured car,

905
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,195
another one of Claremont's
network of stooges.

906
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,748
His mother Edna
worked at the Nedles DMV.

907
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,719
Mama! You're not gonna believe this.
Mama, come quick!

908
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,755
- Where are the First Ladies?
- They disappeared.

909
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,432
What do you mean, they disappeared?

910
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,399
Domino: According to Locus,
they stopped for gas.

911
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,157
I'm gonna fill up the tank and grab
a Mountain Dew. Don't make a peep.

912
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,356
Especially you, Barbara.

913
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,757
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?

914
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,876
I need to get, uh...

915
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,520
$8 of gas and, um...

916
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,273
A Mountain Dew.
Do you have Moonpie?

917
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,749
Yeah, I got a couple of them over there.

918
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,795
And a slim...

919
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,678
Shit! No, no, no!

920
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,469
Domino: He was sure they'd nabbed
the cash. Straight-up double-cross.

921
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,874
But they'd left without it.

922
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,038
That doesn't make any sense.

923
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,199
Well, they left all the money.
It doesn't make sense...

924
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,636
Locus! Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain.

925
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,438
Put the money in the freezer.

926
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,717
- Mama?
- Locus... Fuck 'em.

927
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,514
OK, Mama.

928
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,639
Domino: Either this was some kind of
setup, or the First Ladies got scared,

929
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,551
decided to pull out and cut their losses.

930
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,759
Are you wearing makeup?

931
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,831
What, can you tell? Huh?

932
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,992
You're wearing eyeliner, man.
You look like a drag queen.

933
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,512
Who the hell is that?

934
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,752
Guys, it's time.
We need the bounty hunters.

935
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,400
Come on! 110%.

936
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,836
Llooks like Night of the Living Dead.

937
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,917
Are we on? Now?

938
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,910
Yeah, now.

939
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,390
- Is that a joint?
- No. He's not smoking.

940
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,029
Put that down. You know, television...
the people watching, those kids...

941
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,189
Yeah, yeah...

942
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:33,033
Domino: Claremont fed us a fake story
about the First Ladies.

943
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,796
Are we rolling?

944
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,350
So, today, Domino and her team are out
to nab four criminals for forging checks

945
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,556
with counterfeit driver's licences.

946
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,473
What can you tell us about
these 4 creeps, Domino?

947
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,633
Apparently, they call
themselves the First Ladies.
