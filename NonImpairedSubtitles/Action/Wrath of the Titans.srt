00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,865
Poseidon dead, Zeus captured. The wards...

505
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,534
don't even sit together.

506
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,577
We need your help to rescue Zeus...

507
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,373
so he can stop Kronos.

509
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,544

Yeah.

510
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:01,588
Right. Right. Well, in that case,
we'd best prepare.

511
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,316
For what?
- The end of the bloody world.

512
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,461
Kronos will dismantle the earth.

513
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,790
You'll be scattered across the universe.

514
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,399
Fantastic.

515
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,969
You forged these weapons...

516
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,901
...right here for the gods.
You must be able to help us.

517
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,638
Shut it! How could I...

518
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,277
...when I've no godly power anymore?

519
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,241

520
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,811
Don't you...

521
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,243
...walk away from me.

522
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,145
His all-powerful father
tank it away from me...

523
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,183
...when I sided with Hades
in their little family argument.

524
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:36,414
Yes, I know new it was a mistake!

525
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,821
People forget!

526
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,857
In the beginning, Hades was wise...

527
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:47,833
...and just and strung.

528
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:51,535
It were your daddy became drunk an power.

529
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,037
We were even hoping...

530
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:58,704
when Zeus came he might see
his mistake and restore our...

531
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,182
Why not? He might have, had he came.

532
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,481
{RUMBLING}

533
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:09,953
I'm sorry...

534
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:13,118
...that you think being human
is not enough. But we humans...

535
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:15,786
hope when there's no hope.

536
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,661
And we believe when to believe is idiotic.

537
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,670
But sometimes, in spite...

538
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,306
of everything, we prevail.

539
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:28,668
Now...

540
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,578
...which of you two...

541
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:34,511
...is in charge?

542
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:36,078
- I am.
- Then...

543
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,455
...if we were gods...

544
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,852
...how would you help us free Zeus?

545
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,191
Oh, my dear.

546
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:50,763
You remind me of someone.

547
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,462
Aphrodite.

548
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,397
She was my wife.

549
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,007
Came with me.

550
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,945
If Zeus is captive in the underworld...

551
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,243
...he's likely being held
in the heart of Tartarus.

552
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,753
There can't be much time
before his life farce...

553
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,049
...is completely sapped.

554
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,055
But how do we get to him?

555
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,589
We can't.

556
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,625
Normally you'd be right, young man.

557
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,562
But when I designed this marvel...

558
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,466
...I included a secret passage, a shortcut...

559
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:33,699
...if you will.

560
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,003
- You designed Tartarus?
Oh, aye.

561
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,069
And built it.

562
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,740
Aphrodite, I could...

563
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,214
not only get you inside...

564
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,752
...I could give you a guided tour.

565
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,425
In order for the prison of Tartarus...

566
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,825
...to be completely impregnable...

567
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,932
...I built it from the outside in.

568
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,933
So I had to leave a passage
for me self to get cut...

569
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,971
...when the work was done.
And this labyrinth...

570
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:08,338
...is the only way a human
can travel through the underworld...

571
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,309
...and get to the heart of Tartarus.

572
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:46,504
Where's my snarling bastard of a sun Ares?

573
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:50,449
Will Kronos really spare him'?

574
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,146
And you?

575
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,382
Is there no end to this?

576
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,287
I'm afraid, brother.

577
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,657
Is that what you want me to say?
I'm a god and I'm afraid.

578
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,798
Well, you should be.

579
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:08,595
When your precious humans die,
at least their souls go to another place.

580
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:12,105
When a god dies, it isn't death.

581
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,507
It's just absence.

582
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,240

You see, if you align the edges correctly...

592
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,272
...it gives you a shifting depiction
of the interior.

593
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,241
Can I say, that is a masterpiece.

594
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,245
Well, useful to a paint.

595
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,009
- Would you let a lowly navigator hold it?
- Na.

Well, you are the sun of Poseidon.
