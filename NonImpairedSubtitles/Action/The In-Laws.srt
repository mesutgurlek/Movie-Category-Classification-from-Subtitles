1
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:46,276
You will see that her 
fingerprint matches exactly.

2
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:03,276
That's very nice. 
Very, very, nice.

3
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:08,278
when will your buyer have the money?

4
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:10,283
He should have the money within a week.

5
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:12,283
You will do it in four days.

6
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:15,278
Four days. That's Sunday.

7
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:18,276
I've got something going on on Sunday.

8
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:23,280
Uh, Sunday will be fine. I'll work out my schedule.
I'll juggle it. Not to worry.

9
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,079
One more thing.

10
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:32,284
If I come to America with Olga, 
you think you can get me tickets to Celine Dion?

11
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:38,277
I will not only get you tickets, I will get you backstage.
And if we're really lucky, you'll have coffee with her, okay? All right?

12
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,276
Get down!

13
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:39,279
Well, there's your guys. 
See you in four days?

14
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:12,276
How'd it go?

15
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:14,283
Well, I had a minor snag.

16
00:04:58,287 --> 00:04:59,276
Not bad.

17
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:01,283
Eh, I would've liked to have
gotten in a double twist before the blow-up.

18
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:06,276
Heads up, babe.

19
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:10,276
Thanks, doll-face.

20
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:12,276
Anytime.
Y-You got any gum?

21
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:14,276
Uh, put your thumb in there.

22
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,278
Cherkasov wants to do 
the deal on Sunday.

23
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:20,276
The wedding's on Sunday.

24
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:22,278
I knew that!

25
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:26,279
I wouldn't forget my only son's wedding.
We'll just have to juggle.

26
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:28,276
Don't think of it as a problem.

27
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,279
Think of it as an opportunity for a solution

28
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:36,278
So have you met the bride's family yet?

29
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:39,278
No. I'm a little worried about that.
About what?

30
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:41,276
Well, the father. He's a doctor.

31
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:45,279
You know how they are.
They think they're better than all the rest of us.

32
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:48,278
He's probably a brain surgeon or something.

33
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:55,283
I need you to listen to me carefully now
because it's getting very, very serious.

34
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:56,278
Uh-huh. All right.

35
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:58,276
Now the fungus on your toes is coming back.

36
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:03,279
Are you putting the powder in your shoes?
Are you using the cream at night?

37
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:04,278
Eh, sometimes.

38
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:07,278
If a piano was falling on your head,
you move out of the way "sometimes"?

39
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:09,276
It's a fungus. I wasn't worried.

40
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,278
Start worrying! It doesn't hurt to worry!

41
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:14,276
Doctor Peyser, your daughter's here.

42
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:16,276
Oh. I'll be right back.

43
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:19,117
Hey, Daddy.

44
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:20,276
Hi, sweetie.

45
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:22,276
What'd you want?

46
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:24,163
Okay.

47
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,278
The Mortons are bringing their children now.

48
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,276
You know their eight-year-old, Irwin?

49
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:29,157
Yeah.

50
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,881
He has a shoe fetish.

51
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:33,280
So I had them at the table with Uncle
Bemie and Aunt Thelma, but I think this is a problem.

52
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:36,278
Thelma was beaten up in a shoe store.

53
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:38,163
My God.

54
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:42,280
So I don't want to put them together.
So I'm gonna move Bemie and Thelma to the twelve-step table.

55
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:46,279
Fine. Whatever. Whatever you want, Dad.
I just don't want you to be too anxious about the seating chart.

56
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:49,278
No, I'm fine. I just want the best 
wedding in the world, that's all.

57
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:51,163
I know.

58
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,279
And Marc's only requirement is that his parents are at
separate tables facing away from each other and out of earshot.

59
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:56,163
Yeah, I know.

60
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:57,276
And don't forget, his dad's 
coming over at seven tonight.

61
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,276
Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it.

62
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,278
Marc swears he'll be there this time.

63
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:03,282
Well, I'm making a veal.

64
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:05,163
Nice, Dad.

65
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:09,279
Okay, I'll, uh, sign off on this
and fax it to the new caterer and we're done.

66
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:11,276
Uh... The new caterer?

67
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:13,163
Yeah, you know that.

68
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:14,276
Daddy, you fired another caterer?

69
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:18,286
Well, they weren't caterers.
That was a man and his wife and-and lettuce.

70
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:24,281
Okay. That's fine. I didn't even want a caterer
I just wanted six people and a beach, but...

71
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:26,163
Melissa...

72
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,278
this is what you want.
This is the wedding you'll remember.

73
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:30,163
You're right.

74
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:31,163
Thank you, Dad.

75
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:33,163
Bye.

76
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:38,281
Get the beach out of your head. It's overrated!
You'll be standing there in front of an E. Coli sign!

77
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:42,276
Ah, shit. We got a fire in number one again.

78
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:44,276
Got any halon left?

79
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:46,163
Barely.

80
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:47,276
We're losing altitude.

81
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:48,282
Coming up on Nova Scotia.

82
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:50,276
Where do we stand with Thibodoux?

83
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:52,163
You're meeting with his person tonight in Chicago.

84
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:55,279
I can't meet with him tonight! I've got the in-laws for dinner.
I've blown them off three times already.

85
00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:57,276
I can meet with Thibodoux's person and you can do the parent thing.

86
00:07:58,287 --> 00:07:59,276
No, no, no. You're not ready yet.

87
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:01,276
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

88
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:07,280
Who got you into this business? I taught you everything you know.
When you're ready, you can take the lead.

89
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,278
I'll figure it out tonight. I'll just, uh, improvise.

90
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:14,276
Okay, here we go!

91
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:19,280
Mayday, Mayday!
Lear Niner-Whiskey-Mike approaching Cape Breton

92
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,278
And this is when Melissa went bungee jumping.

93
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,276
She's so crazy.

94
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:47,276
Was that my dad?

95
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:49,163
Nope.

96
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,276
Your father seems to be working all the time.

97
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:54,279
I mean, I had no idea selling
X erox machines was so demanding.

98
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,278
Oh, it's a wild ride. Yeah. But he loves it.

99
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,276
I have an announcement to make!

100
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:02,278
The glaze on the veal is now a laminate!

101
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:04,276
It's like a plastic jacket.

102
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:07,276
He doesn't usually cook.

103
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:10,084
Oh. He can't handle the pressure.

104
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:11,276
I'd just like to know what day we're gonna eat!

105
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:13,276
Oh! He's here.

106
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,163
All right.

107
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,276
Here we go.

108
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:19,276
I am sorry! I am so sorry! My apologies!

109
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:25,281
Engine trouble! Mea culpa! Mea culpa to the tenth power...

110
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:27,163
Are you Katherine?

111
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:28,163
Mm-mm.

112
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:29,276
Oh, my God! Marc said you were gorgeous
but he didn't do you justice.

113
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:31,276
Come here. Come here. All right.

114
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:33,163
Oh, well, thank you

115
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:34,276
Oh... Nice to see you! Thank you!

116
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:35,282
Hello, beautiful. How are you?

117
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:37,163
Hey, how are you

118
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,283
Oh, good to see you. Hiya, buddy. Hey,
glad you could make it. Sorry, business.

119
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,282
Aw, it's all right

120
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,282
No. She'll be at the rehearsal dinner

121
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:43,163
Okay, good.

122
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:46,279
Boy, do you have a beautiful house here.

123
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,276
What is that, veal jerky

124
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:50,276
We passed "jerky" about an hour ago

125
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:53,276
Oh, this has gotta be the doctor

126
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:56,163
Come here

127
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:57,163
That's all right.

128
00:09:57,287 --> 00:09:58,163
Oh, come here. Come on.

129
00:09:58,287 --> 00:09:59,276
No, no, no, no, no. No, I don't like this.

130
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,163
Okay.

131
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:02,163
Oh!

132
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:04,278
Well, thank you, Jer.

133
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:06,283
I don't need your watch. I've already got my own right here.

134
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:08,163
What are you talking about?

135
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:12,276
How did you do that?

136
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,278
I love magic tricks

137
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:22,157
Oh! That's wonderful

138
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:23,163
Hah. That's so cool!

139
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:24,163
Good stuff, huh

140
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:26,278
Breaks the ice a little bit, huh? Gets that party going

141
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:30,276
All right. Well, that's very entertaining

142
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:32,276
Yeah, Dad, does he get the watch back?

143
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:36,279
Of course he's gonna get the watch back! I just feel terrible about the meal
so dinner is on me! He who is tardy pays for the party, okay?

144
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:39,285
Okay.

145
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:42,278
Jer, Kathy, what do you feel like? Ethnic food

146
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:45,163
How ethnic?

147
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:52,278
This place is gonna knock your socks off.

148
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,163
Oh!

149
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,278
I'm just gonna meet you inside
okay? Dad, can I have a second with you over here?

150
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,276
At least the dog looks fresh.

151
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:06,163
Just relax, honey.

152
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:07,276
The whole schmoozy salesman thing?

153
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:08,282
Yeah, how's that playing?

154
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:10,276
Let's just take it down a notch.

155
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,276
Yeah, okay, I got ya. Thanks.

156
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:19,278
Good evening and welcome to Quan Lee. Table for five?

157
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:21,276
Are you full tonight?

158
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:23,276
Expecting to be any moment, sir.

159
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,278
Hey! Hey, Steve!

160
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,276
Oh, Uh, this is Quan Lee. He's the owner of the place here.

161
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:44,281
Quan Lee and I did some, uh
copy-related work in Vietnam together, right?

162
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,276
Katherine, why don't you sit over here?

163
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:54,276
He had a copier with a paper slot that was choked with paper.

164
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,276
So I destroyed the copier.

165
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:06,276
Oh, Dad's always got great stories.

166
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,278
Tastes like beer, but it's got an incredible buzz.

167
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:24,276
Hm, this guy gets around.

168
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,279
He's chased across Prague by Interpol in the moming
has dinner with U.S. contacts that night!

169
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:34,163
Oh.

170
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,276
So have you ever been to Vietnam?

171
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:38,278
No, but we hear it's lovely.

172
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:40,163
Yeah.

173
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:43,279
Jerry prefers to stay in one place.
He... had an anxiety attack watching an airline commercial once.

174
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:46,278
Honey, I did not have an anxiety attack.

175
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:51,280
And if I remember correctly,
that airline is now out of business so, thank you very much!

176
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:55,279
Jer, I'm with you. I like to be in control.
I like to be right there in the driver's seat.

177
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:58,278
In which case, pray you're not a passenger.

178
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:00,276
Marc doesn't like the way I drive.

179
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:05,279
I mean, am I wrong?
I look at traffic signals as sort of a suggestion.

180
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,163
Well, in that case, you would be wrong.

181
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,163
He would.

182
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,163
Who's that?

183
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:11,163
Which one?

184
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:12,163
The guy on the left.

185
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:13,163
Just a sec.

186
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:19,276
You got him?

187
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:24,276
I've got no I.D.

188
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:26,276
He could be deep cover.

189
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:28,163
Menus.

190
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,278
Would you like me to bring you
some arm extenders with that, Mister Steve?

191
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:37,279
No, I'm fine, thank you. I'm just, uh, I'm stretching.

192
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,278
Uh, we'll have the, uh, house special, please.

193
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:46,163
Excellent.

194
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,163
Extra hot!

195
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:53,276
Let-let me check with her, make sure they do it right.

196
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:56,278
But-but whatever you bring out extra hot, bring out mild too.

197
00:13:57,287 --> 00:13:58,163
Or eggs!

198
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:07,278
Can we hold this off for about two hours?

199
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:09,276
I have to wire my employer in thirty minutes.

200
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:17,280
Hey, Jer, wait till you see the special. You are gonna flip out.

201
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:19,163
We're very excited.

202
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:20,163
I can't wait.

203
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:29,278
Hey, Jer, you all right? You haven't even touched your food.

204
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,276
Uh, my food is still eating.

205
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:33,276
Well, I think it's time for a toast.

206
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:35,163
Hear, hear.

207
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,163
Marc...

208
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,163
...buddy...

209
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:40,278
...seems like, you know
yesterday you were just starting school and...

210
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:42,276
What was the name of that school?

211
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:45,163
Horton?

212
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:46,276
Horton. Horton, yeah. Sorry.

213
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,278
I should have gotten there a little more often, but, uh...

214
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:51,276
...look at you now.

215
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:55,279
Out of law school, working with a brand new firm...

216
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,276
...about to marry this beautiful girl.

217
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:07,276
Where'd the time go, man?

218
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:16,276
I gotta go to the john.

219
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:18,163
Oh, I'm sorry.

220
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,278
Cheers.

221
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,276
Oh, you haven't even tasted it.

222
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,281
I might as well eat Barbara Walters.

223
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:49,276
Oh, I'm going to the bathroom.

224
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:51,276
I don't like to be kept waiting.

225
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:53,276
You know we're hot?

226
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,279
If we're going to do this, we have to do it now. Take it out.

227
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:05,276
Should I put it in?

228
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:07,276
I'll do it.

229
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:15,276
Very well. Good old Olga.

230
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:17,276
She's in pretty good shape for a twenty-year-old runaway.

231
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:19,163
Where is she exactly?

232
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:20,276
I'll tell you when I get the money.

233
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:29,280
Bring the proof to Monsieur Thibodoux.
I'll wire him now, tell him you check out.

234
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:34,280
I'm not going to France. I just came back from Europe.
I'm barely adjusted to the time change. This deal has gotta go down by Sunday.

235
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,276
If you are not serious about brokering a deal for Olga...

236
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:39,197
I am serious...

237
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:43,163
Hey, Jer?

238
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,276
You're not a stall-peeper, are you?

239
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:48,276
No. No.

240
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:52,279
Because they got a website for guys like you.
You know, I think you oughta take it online.

241
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:56,279
Actually... I dropped a quarter and... It's not in there?

242
00:16:57,287 --> 00:16:58,163
No.

243
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:00,278
I don't need it. I'm all right.

244
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,163
Yeah, could I do this alone?

245
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:10,276
You're not centered.

246
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:20,286
Would you mind? I... It's too close for me.
I have a... shy bladder and... Oh, great. Talk to me on day six.

247
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:26,281
Hey, Jer. You still here? Oh, you got that-that shy bladder thing, huh?
Well, that's, uh, that's pretty common.

248
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:29,278
Buddy, you mind? My friend here is trying to take a pee...

249
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:37,276
Well, well. What do we have here, huh?

250
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:39,276
I'll come back.

251
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,282
No, you stay where you are, Jer.

252
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:42,276
his man's just about to leave.

253
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:45,163
Excuse me.

254
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:47,276
What is this? I mean, what? Look, next...

255
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,279
...time I see a woman in the men's room,
I'm calling management, all right?

256
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:53,163
Can you believe this?

257
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:54,163
Doug?

258
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,276
That's it! We're going home.
The wedding is off.

259
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:11,163
What?

260
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:12,276
Dad, what are you talking about?

261
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:14,163
Jerry, what happened?

262
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:15,163
He just beat up a guy in the bathroom!

263
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:16,163
What?

264
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:17,276
When he wasn't even going to the
bathroom in the bathroom to begin with!

265
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:19,163
Dad, you're going insane!

266
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:20,163
I'm already there.

267
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,163
I got it.

268
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:25,276
Ooh, an unconscious person.
You must be working.

269
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,278
The first thing I noticed about the guy is he supinates!

270
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:31,163
So?

271
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,278
Well, why would his shoes show medial heel erosion?
Only pronators have that! Never mind, it's technical.

272
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:38,279
Marc is a wonderful guy, but this is too much for me to handle!

273
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:41,278
Fine! Don't marry Marc! I will!

274
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,276
Don't "Jerry" me now. Let's go.

275
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:45,163
Sweetheart, just...

276
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:46,276
Honey, let's go, let's go, let's go.

277
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:48,163
Now.

278
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:49,163
M-Mom!

279
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:50,276
I tried to push this thing till...

280
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:53,278
Look, it's bad enough that you screwed up your personal life.
I'm not gonna let you screw up mine.

281
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:55,276
Listen, I'll make this up to you.

282
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:59,279
No-no-no-no-no! No, no. You listen.
Don't apologize to me. Apologize to them.

283
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,278
You fix this. You fix this.

284
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:06,276
Okay. I hear you.

285
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:11,278
I'm sorry about my father.

286
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:12,203
Oh, honey, I'm sorry about my father.

287
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:13,276
Here.

288
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,278
Thanks. I have an idea!

289
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,163
Yeah?

290
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:21,278
Let's you and me leave town immediately!
Let's escape our wedding.

291
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,276
There's no escaping.

292
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,163
Oh, really?

293
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:26,163
Really.

294
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,278
Isn't this supposed to be about us?

295
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:34,280
Oh, sweet, funny, whimsical Melissa.
Weddings aren't about the bride and groom.

296
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:36,163
Oh.

297
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:37,163
Yeah.

298
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:46,276
There he is! He's inside, let's move! Go!

299
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:59,278
Hey! Get that out!

300
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,280
Now some doctors like to operate
but I believe in exhausting all nonsurgical techniques first.

301
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:10,276
This gentleman, however, will need surgery.

302
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:12,163
What?

303
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:15,279
Oh, I'm sorry. That is my fault.
I should've told you that privately.

304
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:20,082
It slipped out. It's not a big deal.
At worst, you'd lose a toe.

305
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,163
Oh, my God.

306
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,163
It rarely happens.

307
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:29,278
All right, gorgeous,
you arrange for the plane and I'll be right back.

308
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:33,279
Are you sure about this?
We've got the FBI on us like trailer trash on Velveeta.

309
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:37,279
Yeah. No, I, uh, promised Marc.
Besides, I owe the guy an apology.

310
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:59,278
Okay, guys, let's try and keep a low profile.

311
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:27,286
Since we're talking about the sesamoid bones,
let's see their role in the deformity anatomically

312
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,283
known as hallux abducto valgus or what? The...

313
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:31,163
The bunion.

314
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:33,278
The bunion... What are you doing here?

315
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:37,279
Listen to you. You're Mister Medical Authority.

316
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:40,278
I asked you on the telephone not to come here!
I don't want to see you again.

317
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:47,283
I just wanted to apologize and make sure that you
don't have any problem with me that would interfere with the wedding.

318
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:49,276
Oh, there's not going to be a wedding.

319
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:51,276
Uh, would you like us to step outside, sir?

320
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:53,276
No, I wouldn't.

321
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:57,279
Do you know what a remarkable teacher you have here?

322
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:04,283
This man was chosen Chicago's Podiatrist
of the Year three years in a row! So let's give him a hand! Huh?

323
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:10,276
Would you please leave right now?

324
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:14,279
Five minutes, a cup of coffee.
I just want to iron out a couple of things.

325
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,278
If I give you five minutes,
will you leave me alone forever?

326
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:19,163
Of course I will.

327
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:23,279
I need five minutes. All right? Just relax. I'll be right back

328
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:25,163
Thank you

329
00:22:27,287 --> 00:22:31,280
This is where I work.
I don't bother you when you're in the bathroom with your hookers.

330
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:33,163
Wha-what are you talking about?

331
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:35,278
Oh, please!
Olga, the twenty-year-old runaway!

332
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:38,163
What are you doing? That...

333
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:39,276
No more magic tricks.

334
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:41,283
No, Jer... No, Jer, Jer. Y-You don't to... No, Jer!

335
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,157
Thank you.

336
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:43,163
What-what happened? What is that?

337
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:44,163
You! Freeze!

338
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:45,163
What?

339
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:47,163
What happened?

340
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:48,163
I said freeze!

341
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:50,276
How'd it go?

342
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,278
Patch things up with the family?

343
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:55,276
Well, not really.

344
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,276
You took my picture?

345
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:18,283
Jerome Allen Peyser, two-hundred Rector Place. Subject was
apprehended in possession of nine-point-four milliliters of fissile nuclear waste.

346
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:20,163
Fissile what?

347
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:23,279
Yeah, right! Next you're gonna tell me you've never heard of Olga.

348
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:25,276
The twenty-year-old runaway.

349
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:32,283
Hey, I don't know what that means!
I overheard it! Listen, I'm a foot doctor!

350
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,276
Mm-hm.

351
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:39,280
I want a name. What's your name? I want names!

352
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:01,163
Hutchins! Now I get to ask a question.
Where'd you get that canister from? This man?

353
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:03,278
That's him!

354
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:05,276
That's the guy! That's who I got it from!

355
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:08,278
The homeless guy?

356
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:10,276
Great. An arms dealer and a smart-ass!

357
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:12,276
Arms dealer? What happened to pimp?

358
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:14,276
Well, fine! You're a pimp, too!

359
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,163
No, I'm nothing! It's him!

360
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:18,278
Who?

361
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:20,276
And the meter maid is the hostess!

362
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:22,276
Nobody is who they are here!

363
00:24:24,287 --> 00:24:25,276
It sounds like you're tripping on drugs, pal.

364
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,276
Look, he's talking to me!

365
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:52,276
God, don't be such a pussy!

366
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:56,279
Don't call me a pussy!
You just made me radioactive with your fissile nuclear waste in my pocket!

367
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,276
Bet you never said that sentence before in your life, Jer.

368
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:00,276
Of course, 'cause I don't even know what it means!

369
00:25:01,287 --> 00:25:02,276
Some things you shouldn't know. Thanks.

370
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:04,276
You probably gave me leukemia!

371
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:06,276
Oh, you're gonna befine. Now hop in.

372
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:08,276
I'm not, I'm not hopping anywhere with you!

373
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:11,278
Jer, we are family and don't make me do something I don't wanna do.

374
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:16,280
We're not family! There's not gonna be a mar...
I'm going! I'm going!

375
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:18,163
Tight! It's a Cushman! It goes five miles an hour.
continues under following scene Now, you hold on tight.

376
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:19,276
Not this one.

377
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:21,163
Slow down!

378
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:25,163
Listen, while I got you here,
I just wanted to tell you I'm so sorry I had to drag you through all of this.

379
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:29,280
Okay, wait a minute!

380
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:37,276
Is that a fanny pack?

381
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,163
Yes.

382
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:43,276
What's so funny?

383
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:50,276
Wahoo!

384
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,278
This isn't funny! There's a girl!

385
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:03,281
Stop this! Stop the little thing!

386
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:07,279
Jer, I'm worried about you.
You just don't look good. Let me get you a glass of water.

387
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:10,278
So what's the plane situation?
Am I gonna make it to Thibodoux's in time or not?

388
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:13,285
It shouldn't be a problem. You have tailwinds over the East Coast.
He's expecting you at three. Look, you want me with you there, I can rejig.

389
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:15,163
Here you go, Jer.

390
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:17,278
No, I need you here.
I want to make sure Cherkasov is okay with the Chicago drop. Jer!

391
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:19,276
Jer. Don't go there, Jer.

392
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:28,278
Jer?

393
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:34,280
Jer, you're really gonna have to work on your listening skills.

394
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:36,276
Mister X erox! Well, a great supply of copiers you have here!

395
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:38,276
I like the one shaped like a rocket launcher. Does it collate?

396
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:40,276
Is that a fanny pack?

397
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:42,163
It's cute, isn't it?

398
00:26:42,287 --> 00:26:45,279
It's adorable.

399
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:47,276
I'm riveted. Go on.

400
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:51,279
Yeah, it's a fanny pack.
I'm a doctor, something you know nothing about!

401
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:57,281
I have a phone in here, and a pager,
and some Loma Doones in case I get hungry.

402
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:00,163
And I also have a personal attack alarm
and if you come near me again I'm gonna use it!

403
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,276
She slapped me!

404
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:06,278
Did you like it?

405
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:10,279
So just tell me what you are.
You're a smuggler? A pimp? You deal in Russian runaways?

406
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:14,279
Yeah, we're all those things and more.
We are deep undercover.

407
00:27:16,287 --> 00:27:18,278
We're the CIA.

408
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:20,276
Great, now we have to kill him.

409
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:23,276
Aw, Anj. Enough already, huh?

410
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:25,163
Fine.

411
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:26,276
I'm gonna go salvage what's left of my personal life.

412
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:32,278
I don't believe anything you're saying.

413
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:35,278
Well, maybe it's better that way.
The one thing you should know is that we are the good guys.

414
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,279
Okay, well, look, I didn't see anything.
I'll never tell a soul. So take me home and I'm done.

415
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:41,276
We'll talk about it on the plane.

416
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:43,276
I don't fly. There's no plane.

417
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,279
Doctor, do you know what a roofie is?

418
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:51,279
Yeah, I know what a roofie is.
Frat boys give them to girls at parties.

419
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:57,276
Oh, no, no.

420
00:27:58,287 --> 00:27:59,276
Oh, don't rape me...

421
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:28,163
Hello?

422
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:46,276
Hey, Jer?

423
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:49,276
We're on a plane!

424
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:54,280
Yes, we are and you're doing quite well, I might add.
I'm making myself an omelet. You hungry?

425
00:28:55,287 --> 00:28:56,163
I feel sick.

426
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:58,278
Yeah, I wanted to ask you,
how'd that stuff work out that I put in your drink?

427
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,276
Gives you a hell of a kick doesn't it?

428
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:02,276
People say they wake up so refreshed.

429
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:04,276
You gave me a roofie!

430
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,276
There's nobody flying!

431
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,279
No, Gulfstream Five, top of the line.
This baby flies itself.

432
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:15,280
This one, I think, belongs to Barbra Streisand.
What kind of omelet fillings you want?

433
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,276
You stole Barbra Streisand's plane?

434
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:21,279
I borrowed it, all right? It's not exactly like we're
going to the Bahamas or anything. I mean, this is official business.

435
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:24,276
I'm gonna throw up!

436
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:26,276
Bathroom's right behind me.

437
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:32,281
You know, I'm really proud of you, Jer.
You know, I think you really conquered this flying thing. You're my hero.

438
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,278
You have dialed an invalid country code.

439
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:12,276
Okay, Marc is su-such a wonderful guy.

440
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:16,278
And you are so lucky.

441
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:21,278
I'm gonna get so drunk!

442
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:36,278
I'm totally fine!
I fall all the time, you guys. I fall every day.

443
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:42,276
Melissa, it's your father!

444
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:44,163
Dad

445
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:46,278
H-honey? Dad, I can't hear anything.
You're breaking up.

446
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:47,282
Honey. Honey. I'll take it, take it

447
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:49,083
Jerry.

448
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:53,280
Katherine!
I am in the bathroom of Barbra Streisand's airplane.

449
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:56,319
Steve is taking me to France.

450
00:30:57,287 --> 00:30:59,278
Honey, your father's going to France with Barbra Streisand!

451
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:01,163
Babs!

452
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:05,278
I'm not going to France with Barbra Streisand!

453
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:08,278
So what's she like? Is she nice?

454
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:10,163
She's not here!

455
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:11,163
I love Barbra Streisand.

456
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,276
They're taking me against my will!

457
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:14,276
Jerry, this doesn't make any sense at all.

458
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:18,279
These things don't have to make sense, Katherine.
Call everyone! All the authorities!

459
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:20,163
Do it now!

460
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:26,283
Is Melissa okay? She said something to me in the office.
I'm worried about her. Put-put her back on the phone.

461
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:28,163
What? Je-Jerry.

462
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,276
Hey, Jer, you fall in?

463
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:31,276
Yeah, I did. I fell in.

464
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:33,276
I'll be out in a minute.

465
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:37,083
Hello, hello?

466
00:31:37,287 --> 00:31:39,278
Mom, can you come here for a minute?

467
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:46,279
Oh, no. This is about the tax retum, isn't it?

468
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:50,276
You ever been to France, Jer?

469
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:52,276
No.

470
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,278
I-I-I think we're flying way too low.

471
00:31:57,287 --> 00:32:01,280
Well, we gotta stay under the radar.
It makes things a little less complicated.

472
00:32:01,327 --> 00:32:02,282
Yeah, but this is just too low!

473
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:05,278
So let me tell you about this guy we're gonna see.

474
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:06,282
His name is Jean-Pierre Thibodoux.

475
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:10,286
Now he is a smuggler of the worst kind. But not to worry, all right?

476
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:12,283
We're just going in and out.

477
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:19,278
Gotta pick up a hundred and seventy million dollars. Hopefully broker a deal
where I can, you know, bust both the buyer and the seller. Put 'em in jail.

478
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:22,285
You're getting a hundred and seventy million dollars?

479
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:28,277
Yeah. It's chump-change for a guy like that. Once he's got Olga,
I mean, he can control the black market in the U.S., Russia and the Middle East.

480
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:30,283
So everybody wants this Olga.

481
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:33,278
Oh, my God. Oh, no. What's this shaking?

482
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,278
What is that? That's too much!

483
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:40,279
Do you know anything about flying a G-Five?

484
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:42,283
That's not funny!

485
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:44,276
No, I'm serious, Jer.
There's... there's something wrong here!

486
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:47,276
What are you doing?
Why are you banging that?

487
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:51,285
Oh! Do... do you know
how you put the landing gear down in this?

488
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:55,286
You don't know where the landing gear is? How can you not know that?

489
00:32:57,287 --> 00:32:59,278
I got you so good, didn't I, Jer?

490
00:33:03,287 --> 00:33:04,163
You son-of-a-

491
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,278
My husband couldn't possibly be buying a...

492
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:13,276
Could you please repeat that?

493
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,285
A stealth nuclear submarine. Missing since nineteen ninety-eight.

494
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:20,286
The commander of the fleet, one Alexei Cherkasov,
now a kingpin with the Russian mob has been selling off stolen military equipment

495
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:24,283
This is his big-ticket item.

496
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:28,286
And we found a sample of her
fissile nuclear waste in your husband's possession.

497
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:30,276
Fissile nu-nuclear-what?

498
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:35,276
Uh, each submarine emits a kind of radioactive waste which
bears a unique imprint to that particular sub. A proof of possession, if you will.

499
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:37,283
You guys, m-my dad wouldn't buy a Russian sub.
I mean, he won't even buy a foreign car!

500
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:41,286
Place is clean.

501
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,278
Hm. Thank you.

502
00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:46,276
We'll be in touch.

503
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:49,276
Guys, let's go

504
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:53,278
When I opened the door,
I thought they were strippers!

505
00:33:57,287 --> 00:34:01,280
So I'm in France because of submarine piss.

506
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:02,282
Yeah, it's nutty, isn't it?

507
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:07,276
Think what you'll be able to tell your grandchildren.
Of course, you'll be swom to secrecy so you won't be able to, but...

508
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:10,276
Bonjour.

509
00:34:11,287 --> 00:34:12,163
Who're these guys?

510
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:14,163
Bonjour.

511
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:15,276
(in French) Bonjour,? A va?

512
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,276
Hi, how are you? Nice hair.

513
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:19,276
I don't understand something.

514
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:23,286
Why would a smuggler want a...

515
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:26,163
Large, armed, virtually undetectable transport vehicle?

516
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:31,281
Right.

517
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:44,276
So he moves drugs, munitions, everything.
World falls apart, this guy makes a fortune.

518
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:46,163
(in French) Bonjour. Bonjour,? A va?

519
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:47,276
Bonjour.

520
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:54,283
I see a lot of guns.

521
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:56,283
Did you ever think it's because you wanna see the guns, Jer?
I mean, I look around, I see birds, flowers, beautiful girls. The cup is half full.

522
00:34:57,287 --> 00:35:02,281
You know, you've got to stop, smell the roses. Arms up.

523
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:09,280
Please be careful. I have very sensitive underarms. I just don't...

524
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,278
Don't do that! Please! Please!

525
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:28,279
By the way, this fanny pack comes from France.

526
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:34,163
Oh.

527
00:35:35,287 --> 00:35:40,281
Look at you! You're just an old guy pretending to be a little kid.

528
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:50,280
Take a good look, boys.
I've been known to shoot tranq-darts from myknees.

529
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:52,197
Knee brace!

530
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:57,281
The brace is for getting through metal detectors.
Distracts them from the knife in my shoe.

531
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:00,276
Steven!

532
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,276
Jean-Pierre! Come on.

533
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:11,166
One little thing I almost forgot. I've been known to
travel with some dangerous types, so he might think that you're an arms dealer,

534
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:14,279
you know, or a deadly assassin.

535
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:16,283
So you just play along with it.
Okay?

536
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:18,283
What? Just play along at being a deadly as...

537
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:21,278
Silent, but deadly.

538
00:36:22,287 --> 00:36:25,279
Ah, Jean-Pierre.

539
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:32,278
But, we must hold our introduction.

540
00:36:33,287 --> 00:36:34,276
Please, gentlemen, walk with me.

541
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,278
This man was caught stealing from me.

542
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:55,281
Uh, were this one year ago, I would torture him to death.
But, I have made some personal growth. You notice it, right?

543
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:57,283
Well, I noticed right off the bat, Jean-Pierre.

544
00:36:58,287 --> 00:37:01,279
Yeah, well, I'm calmer now.
I am more centered. I spent some time with Deepak Chopra.

545
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:06,276
He wrote "Molecules of Emotion"
and "Natural Healing for Anxiety and Depression."

546
00:37:06,327 --> 00:37:08,283
I have leamed how to forgive.

547
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,276
Run for your life!

548
00:37:45,287 --> 00:37:47,278
Well, I, I know I need to do more work on myself.

549
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:49,276
You're doing great, J.P.

550
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:50,282
I did not get your name.

551
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:52,163
Jerry.

552
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:55,276
You don't know who this guy is?

553
00:37:56,287 --> 00:37:57,163
No.

554
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:02,278
The Fat Cobra

555
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:07,276
Well, I am honored.

556
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,163
Oh.

557
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:12,278
And I hope we shall get to know each other better.

558
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:18,163
Follow me.

559
00:38:21,287 --> 00:38:22,276
Exactly who am I?

560
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:26,286
A legendary crime leader known only as the Fat Cobra.

561
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:28,197
Fat Cobra?

562
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:29,163
Mm-hm.

563
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:32,279
So... what does that refer to?
A snake? Slithery? Venomous? What?

564
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:36,279
Uh, no, not exactly. It refers to...

565
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:41,278
Oh... shit.

566
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:56,279
Your contact will meet the seller in Chicago on Sunday.

567
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:58,283
Then he'll give him Olga's location.

568
00:38:58,327 --> 00:38:59,282
It was Nova Scotia on Wednesday.

569
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:03,286
It's Chicago on Sunday.
What do you want from me? Uh, I'm the middleman here.

570
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:13,278
One hundred and seventy in cash and bearer bonds.

571
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:17,279
But I don't usually hand over cash before first seeing the merchandise.

572
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:20,285
Oh, J.P., who gave you the rocket launchers last month on credit?

573
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:22,283
How long have we known each other? Years!

574
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:25,276
All right, I trust you.

575
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:31,280
Besides, if you try to screw me,
I will kill you and everyone you've ever met.

576
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:42,281
That's great, huh? That's great... Ow, shit, that knee!
So you wanna wait here while I count the money or you two wanna take a walk?

577
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:44,200
We'll wait here. Oh.

578
00:39:44,287 --> 00:39:49,281
No! I would love nothing more
than to share a drink with the legendary Fat Cobra.

579
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:15,281
I have bad knees. Grab a chair for me.

580
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:28,279
Those mosquitoes are bad this time of year

581
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:49,276
So you're buying a submarine.

582
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:50,203
Mm.

583
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:51,276
Well, that'll be nice.

584
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:59,280
Wonderful. Now I can take anything anywhere.
Cocaine, nuclear devices. Whatever you want, I will move it.

585
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:03,279
That's terrific. We just got another Towne Car.

586
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:05,163
Ah.

587
00:41:05,287 --> 00:41:06,276
Please make yourself comfortable.

588
00:41:07,287 --> 00:41:10,279
Okay. We're gonna lay here together? Uh.

589
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:21,163
Oh, thank you.

590
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:26,280
To Fat Cobra... in the flesh.

591
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:28,197
Mm.

592
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:46,280
So tell me, how many kills do you have?

593
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:48,197
Kills?

594
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:51,276
Six only?

595
00:41:53,287 --> 00:41:54,276
Since Christmas.

596
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:59,278
People think we are insane.

597
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:00,157
Hm.

598
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:04,280
But they don't know the joy of holding
a man's beating heart in the palm of your hand.

599
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:06,276
that's a good feeling.

600
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:07,157
Oh

601
00:42:08,287 --> 00:42:09,276
Let's take a walk.

602
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:12,278
Uh, no, I... I walked too much today.

603
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:17,279
Besides, I have a little pain here behind my ankle.

604
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,276
Let me take a look at it.

605
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:20,203
What do you mean?

606
00:42:21,287 --> 00:42:22,276
I'm a foot person.

607
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:24,197
Just like me.

608
00:42:25,287 --> 00:42:28,279
All right, tell me something here. Is it tender right... there?

609
00:42:29,287 --> 00:42:30,197
Yes!

610
00:42:32,287 --> 00:42:34,278
You have plantar fasciitis in the heel.

611
00:42:34,327 --> 00:42:35,203
Mm.

612
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:36,276
You should go soak that.

613
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:38,276
Did you say "soak?"

614
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:17,197
Voila!

615
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:22,279
I-I didn't mean soak the whole body.

616
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:25,278
I'll grab a bathing suit.
Which would you like, American or French?

617
00:43:27,287 --> 00:43:28,197
Um... Soviet.

618
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:31,197
I'll be right back.

619
00:43:37,287 --> 00:43:38,276
I'm gonna kill you! Kill you!

620
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:40,283
Shh. That's great! Great, Jerry

621
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:47,278
You're getting into character. Now I gotta download his client list and find out
what he's smuggling and where it's traveling to, so keep him looking the other way!

622
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,157
Fat Cobra?

623
00:43:49,287 --> 00:43:51,278
Did you hear what he's calling me?
Did you hear that! Fat Cobra!

624
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:55,163
Ah.

625
00:43:57,287 --> 00:43:58,163
Listen...

626
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:00,276
...l- I have to talk to you.

627
00:44:00,327 --> 00:44:06,277
No, wait! Bu-bu-bu...!
Um, I can't go in there with you, but I'm happy to watch.

628
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:07,157
Why?

629
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:08,276
It's, I have, like, a childhood problem...

630
00:44:08,327 --> 00:44:09,282
Yes.

631
00:44:09,327 --> 00:44:11,283
...disease. Sort of rare.

632
00:44:12,287 --> 00:44:23,277
I-I...I'm not waterproof. My skin will let in water.
So I can't be in a situation where I-I sub-submerse myself.

633
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,157
I... Mm.

634
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,279
So as a child, I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even play with a hose.

635
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,276
You know the Slip 'n Slides?

636
00:44:29,327 --> 00:44:30,282
Yes.

637
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:31,282
I-I cou- Couldn't have that.

638
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:34,276
And, uh, even snow cones.

639
00:44:35,287 --> 00:44:36,163
Yeah.

640
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,278
But anyway, if I got in there and it happened,
then I could really get sick.

641
00:44:39,287 --> 00:44:47,285
In other words, what would happen is the water goes all the way through the skin,
'cause I got a... I got what (on) they, what they call "wet bone."

642
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,278
I'm curious to know more about "wet bone."

643
00:44:54,287 --> 00:45:00,283
Well, the money's all there, huh!
You okay? You're looking a little dizzy.

644
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,278
I'm married. You're married?

645
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:10,282
Yeah, I'm married.

646
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:13,276
Well, actually, we're separated.

647
00:45:13,327 --> 00:45:14,157
Oh.

648
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:18,278
Okay, I killed her.

649
00:45:18,327 --> 00:45:19,203
Ah.

650
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:22,278
Well, my wife is still very much alive.

651
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:25,276
It's very nice to have a wife.

652
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:29,279
But as a man, there are certain things I can only do with other men.

653
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:31,276
Like golf.

654
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:32,282
No, I am not gay!

655
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:38,281
It's just, occasionally I need... the company... of a man.

656
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:41,278
Just 'cause I'm big, it doesn't mean I'm easy.

657
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,163
Wow!

658
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:54,280
Excuse me. Excuse me. I don't want to interrupt. Just wanted to tell you
the money's good, and I talked to the supplier and he'll be there on Sunday.

659
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,276
Would you guys like me to go?

660
00:45:58,327 --> 00:45:59,157
No!

661
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:01,278
We're done!
That was a good soak and I thank you very much.

662
00:46:16,327 --> 00:46:19,285
Intemational operator. Hurry, hurry, hurry

663
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:20,282
Could you hold, please? Excuse me!

664
00:46:23,287 --> 00:46:24,163
Hey!

665
00:46:25,287 --> 00:46:30,281
Peyser is on line one. He's crazed.
Something about Steve Tobias and the Fat Cobra.

666
00:46:31,287 --> 00:46:32,163
Mister Peyser?

667
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:33,197
It's Doctor Peyser!

668
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:35,278
You are in a great deal of trouble. Where you calling from?

669
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,278
How could I be in trouble? I didn't do anything!
Steve Tobias gave me that-that fissile waste!

670
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:40,283
Did you say Steve Tobias?

671
00:46:41,287 --> 00:46:42,163
Yes!

672
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:43,276
He's one of you guys, right?

673
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:48,280
Mister Peyser, this is the FBI.
Tobias was with the CIA, but he was let go. He's a rogue agent.

674
00:46:49,287 --> 00:46:50,276
What does that mean?

675
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:52,276
He went bad.

676
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:54,276
He's mentally unstable and extremely dangerous!
And what's this about the Fat Cobra?!

677
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:59,276
Please, I'm innocent. Why don't you come tonight?
We're gonna be in Chicago at eight o'clock at the Marriott Marquis.

678
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:03,279
We're in the Eleanor Roosevelt Function Room.

679
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:07,279
There's no Eleanor Roosevelt Function Room at that hotel.

680
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,276
One of the Roosevelts!

681
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:12,278
Who you talking to?

682
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:14,276
Just an operator. Nobody.

683
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:20,280
Are you lying to me, Jer?
Because that'll upset me. You don't want to upset me.

684
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:24,276
No, no. No, I don't.

685
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:26,276
Good. So let's get going, huh?

686
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:30,279
Last one to the plane's gonna take a hundred and seventy mil through Customs.

687
00:47:32,287 --> 00:47:34,278
Look, I'm used to dealing with Doctor Peyser, okay?
What do you have to do with this affair?

688
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:38,278
Nothing. I'm the bride.

689
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:41,278
Ah, congratulations.
Now what do you want me to do with the spray of freesia?

690
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:44,278
Hey, buddy, I'll show you where you can put the spray of freesia. Okay?

691
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:46,163
Okay.

692
00:47:46,287 --> 00:47:49,279
Gloria, what'd you do with the,
um, table card seat assignment thingies?

693
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:53,279
Oh, what thingies? I'm a little muzzy.
I think the devil's playing drums in my head.

694
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:57,279
That better be my dad.

695
00:47:58,287 --> 00:47:59,276
"Streisand. Private.

696
00:47:59,327 --> 00:48:00,282
That would be me.

697
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:01,282
Yeah. Yeah.

698
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:05,278
Where are you? Melissa's, uh, just really freaking out
and her dad's not even here and he's the one who planned the whole thing.

699
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:13,284
No, he's right here. He's... fine, uh. Listen, buddy,
I want to give you the heads-up on something. Um...

700
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:20,283
...we've changed the location of the rehearsal dinner. We're gonna meet
you at the Signature Room at the Hancock Tower instead of the Marriott.

701
00:48:20,327 --> 00:48:22,283
You moved the rehearsal dinner?

702
00:48:23,287 --> 00:48:26,279
Well, the Hancock Tower owed
us a favor and they'll set us up really nice.

703
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:29,278
So if you get there before I do
and there's any kind of problem, you ask for Artie.

704
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:31,276
Reference the Alabaster incident.
He'll know exactly what you're talking about.

705
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:33,276
Oh, my God.

706
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,282
I'm sorry about this, buddy, but it's important.

707
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,276
And this isn't?

708
00:48:38,287 --> 00:48:40,278
Now, you gotta trust me on this, all right?
Have I ever let you down?

709
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:42,276
Well, as a matter of fact...

710
00:48:42,327 --> 00:48:43,282
Don't answer that.

711
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,279
I'll make it up to you

712
00:48:49,287 --> 00:48:52,279
Oh, what was the name of
that song you guys sung at that Karaoke club on your first date?

713
00:48:53,287 --> 00:48:58,281
What? I... Uh, "Get Down Tonight"
by, uh, K.C. and the Sunshine Band. Why?

714
00:48:59,287 --> 00:49:00,163
I was just curious.

715
00:49:01,287 --> 00:49:02,276
I'll talk to you later.

716
00:49:11,287 --> 00:49:13,278
So you went and called the FBI.

717
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:18,280
I know all about you now. You're a liar. You lie about everything.

718
00:49:19,287 --> 00:49:27,285
I did not lie to you, Jer. I do not lie to family.
Don't call me family! We're not family!

719
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:38,281
He did what? It's fine. You know,
he switches things around sometimes for his work.

720
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:43,276
How could he just go and do that?
Because he's Steve Tobias. And Steve Tobias is an emotional fascist.

721
00:49:44,287 --> 00:49:51,284
But I-I'd like tosay something. Just because I hate Mark's father,
it's not going to be uncomfortable here at the wedding.

722
00:49:53,287 --> 00:49:54,163
Hello, everyone!

723
00:49:54,287 --> 00:49:55,276
Hi, Mom.

724
00:49:56,287 --> 00:50:00,280
Oh, hi, honey. Mm. Oh, I'm so happy to be here.
And I'm so proud of you.

725
00:50:01,287 --> 00:50:13,279
And finally, the daughter I never had.
Oh. You complete me. You know, Mark was supposed to be a girl.

726
00:50:14,287 --> 00:50:19,281
Oh, and this is Po Po. Po Po? Hi.

727
00:50:19,327 --> 00:50:23,286
He's doing the ceremony with the rabbi! He is?

728
00:50:32,287 --> 00:50:38,283
The Signature Room? Hm.
What happened to the Marriott. It's closer to the ground. Come on.

729
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:41,285
The Signature Room.
I've always wanted to come here, but Jerry gets vertigo.

730
00:50:42,287 --> 00:50:45,279
Thank you so much for the surprise.

731
00:50:46,287 --> 00:50:55,286
This would be Steve's doing. He doesn't have a soul,
so he has to compensate by making extravagant gestures.

732
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,276
Well, marriage is difficult

733
00:51:00,287 --> 00:51:11,277
But we had fantastic sex. Fantastic, angry,
crazy, crazy, crazy sex.

734
00:51:15,287 --> 00:51:16,276
We're here.

735
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:19,276
My God.

736
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:23,279
Your dad must sell a lot of toner.

737
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,163
Oh, hi!

738
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:31,276
Roosevelt! This is it!

739
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:41,276
Freeze!

740
00:51:43,287 --> 00:51:45,278
Got Carlucci! He found them.
They're over at the Hancock Tower.

741
00:51:48,287 --> 00:51:52,280
Peyser set us up! Son of a bitch!
I want the whole unit regrouped downstairs in two minutes! Let's go!

742
00:51:53,287 --> 00:51:55,278
You're doing great, Jer! First an airplane,
now one of the tallest buildings in the world! I'm proud of you.

743
00:51:59,287 --> 00:52:04,281
Has the elevator stopped?

744
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:07,276
Yeah.

745
00:52:07,327 --> 00:52:08,282
It's too high!

746
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:12,276
Well, what's this?

747
00:52:14,287 --> 00:52:16,278
My collapsible cup.

748
00:52:16,327 --> 00:52:18,283
You're a piece of work, Jer.

749
00:52:21,287 --> 00:52:24,279
If it's tap water let it run at least twenty seconds!

750
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,276
Melissa! Melissa!

751
00:52:30,287 --> 00:52:33,279
Daddy, where the hell have you been? First you plan this whole
thing without me and then you disappear when it's coming together!

752
00:52:33,327 --> 00:52:38,276
I don't know anyone here! Honey, I'm sorry.
I went to France. It wasn't (off) my fault.

753
00:52:38,327 --> 00:52:42,286
I just want everything to be wonderful, that's all.

754
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:45,285
Hi! Oh, my God. Hi! I'm trying to. No.

755
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:49,279
Why didn't you wear that other dress? No?
We have to do shots! Shots! Shots! No.

756
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:55,278
Jerry! Hi! Oh. Are you okay?

757
00:52:55,327 --> 00:52:59,286
No! Th-The FBI came to the house!

758
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:04,280
It's Steve! I talked to them.
He's a rogue agent. He's unstable!

759
00:53:05,287 --> 00:53:06,276
Who? Steve!

760
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:08,276
He-he's a rogue X erox agent? No! No! CIA!

761
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,278
Oh. I'm lucky to be here. I had a roofie! I was on a plane!

762
00:53:12,287 --> 00:53:16,280
That's right, you flew! I,
oh, I did. I did fly! Isn't that something?

763
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:19,285
The thing is, you gotta go private. Yeah.

764
00:53:56,287 --> 00:53:58,164
Oh, God. Oh, there you are

765
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:06,283
Judy, Judy, Judy! How are you? You look... great.

766
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:08,283
It's the work at the ashram. Ah. And the therapy. Really?
And several powerful prescription drugs.

767
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,279
I'm kidding about the drugs.

768
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:15,278
Oh. Or am I?

769
00:54:16,287 --> 00:54:19,279
At any rate, let's give ourselves permission to be honest
with each other so that we can have some closure this weekend.

770
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:25,279
Question: Why do you enjoy moving
rehearsal dinners and having everyone hate you?

771
00:54:26,287 --> 00:54:32,283
Another question: On your birthday, why do you always end
up in the bathtub in the fetal position clutching a firearm?

772
00:54:33,287 --> 00:54:37,280
Oh, and one more:
Why did you always weep like a little girl during orgasm?

773
00:54:38,287 --> 00:54:44,283
Answer to all of the above: Fear of intimacy!

774
00:54:45,287 --> 00:54:48,279
Judy... You're heading for a crash, Steve Tobias.
Into a mountain called self-awareness.

775
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:53,278
You have been running away from yourself your whole life.
No, I have not. I've been running away from you!

776
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:54,282
Because I'm the only one that's got your number!

777
00:54:54,327 --> 00:54:55,282
Let's go! Hurry.

778
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:12,278
Well, you're here... and you seem fine.

779
00:55:12,327 --> 00:55:13,282
I seem fine? Have you heard nothing?

780
00:55:14,287 --> 00:55:15,276
hat, am I not talking English? This is fine to you?

781
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:18,278
Hey, hey! Katherine, hi!

782
00:55:19,287 --> 00:55:20,276
Hi, Steve.

783
00:55:20,327 --> 00:55:21,282
How are you?

784
00:55:22,287 --> 00:55:23,276
Get away from me. I brought you your water.

785
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,276
Okay, thanks.

786
00:55:25,327 --> 00:55:26,282
Come on, let's go.

787
00:55:26,327 --> 00:55:27,282
No, I...

788
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:28,282
Come on.

789
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,276
Get help! Get some help!

790
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:35,163
Let's do it!

791
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:37,276
Oh, what the hell is this? I said, "Signature Room!"

792
00:55:37,327 --> 00:55:39,283
I did! I swear!

793
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:40,282
Top floor.

794
00:55:41,287 --> 00:55:42,276
Look, there are only three buttons.

795
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:45,163
Signature Room!

796
00:55:45,287 --> 00:55:50,281
Is this not a beautiful evening?

797
00:55:52,287 --> 00:55:57,281
Well, I stand before you this evening as a very, very happy man.

798
00:55:58,287 --> 00:56:05,284
Not only has the Almighty seen fit
to provide me with a beautiful new daughter...

799
00:56:06,287 --> 00:56:13,284
...but I am blessed with this man here on my left.
A man who has given so much to so many.

800
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:18,280
A man who has a taste for adventure...

801
00:56:19,287 --> 00:56:20,276
This is your... father, right?

802
00:56:21,287 --> 00:56:22,276
Dad? My dad

803
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:24,276
Is that somebody else

804
00:56:25,287 --> 00:56:27,278
...who is willing totry new things...

805
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:31,276
Damn it! Let's take the stairs! Now!

806
00:56:32,287 --> 00:56:41,286
...but most importantly,
a man who I know will always be close in my heart.

807
00:56:42,287 --> 00:56:43,163
A manwho I...

808
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:44,163
He is mentally ill!

809
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:48,280
No, I mean it, he's dangerous!

810
00:56:49,287 --> 00:56:50,276
Listen, he gave me a roofie!

811
00:56:51,287 --> 00:56:54,279
He took me on a plane to France!

812
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,198
Yeah! I took him to France! Ouit! Oui! Oui! Oui!

813
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:03,280
Stop it! He's a rogue agent! He works for the other side!

814
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:08,280
Call somebody!

815
00:57:09,287 --> 00:57:11,278
Well, enough of the hearts and flowers, huh?

816
00:57:13,287 --> 00:57:14,276
We're here to have a good time, right?

817
00:57:15,287 --> 00:57:17,278
Okay!

818
00:57:19,287 --> 00:57:20,276
Here we go!

819
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:23,278
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome K.C. and the Sunshine Band!

820
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:25,163
Oh, my God.

821
00:57:25,287 --> 00:57:26,163
What?

822
00:57:43,287 --> 00:57:47,280
Honey, this is the song we sang on our first date!

823
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,276
Baby... I know. I know.

824
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,278
You are one slick bastard!

825
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:21,279
Look, leave me alone! Find somebody else to torture!

826
00:58:22,287 --> 00:58:23,163
Okay.

827
00:58:24,287 --> 00:58:25,276
Thank you!

828
00:58:27,287 --> 00:58:28,276
Doctor Peyser.

829
00:58:29,287 --> 00:58:30,163
Agent Hutchins, thank God!

830
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:31,276
Freeze! You're under arrest.

831
00:58:32,287 --> 00:58:33,276
What are you doing?

832
00:58:34,287 --> 00:58:35,276
Stay where you are, Doctor Peyser.

833
00:58:36,287 --> 00:58:38,278
Or should we call you Fat Cobra?

834
00:58:39,287 --> 00:58:40,276
I'm not the Fat Cobra!

835
00:58:41,287 --> 00:58:42,276
If necessary, shoot to kill.

836
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:44,276
You got the wrong guy! I'm-I'm-I'm...

837
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:48,276
There's like a hundred guns pointing at my head!

838
00:58:49,287 --> 00:58:51,278
They think you're the Fat Cobra.

839
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,276
'Cause you told them!

840
00:58:54,287 --> 00:58:55,276
No, I didn't! You told them.

841
00:58:56,287 --> 00:58:58,278
No, I didn't! Oh! Oh! Okay.

842
00:59:03,287 --> 00:59:04,276
Melis?

843
00:59:06,287 --> 00:59:12,283
Okay. It may not be the best time to tell you this,
but a couple of years ago, I slept with Mark. And I think I'm still in love with him.

844
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:14,276
What?

845
00:59:22,287 --> 00:59:24,278
Yesterday I was a respected man in my community.

846
00:59:25,287 --> 00:59:26,276
Today they want to kill me!

847
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:29,278
My life is ruined!

848
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:34,280
Jerry, I am sorry I ruined your life,
but you know what? This case is my life.

849
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:43,278
I'm on a roof. I don't... I don't do roofs.

850
00:59:44,287 --> 00:59:45,276
Peyser, down on the ground!

851
00:59:45,327 --> 00:59:46,282
On... the ground... now!

852
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:52,278
Well, buddy, I guess this is it, huh? We tried.

853
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:54,276
Give me a hug.

854
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:57,278
What, are you crazy?

855
00:59:58,287 --> 00:59:59,276
Fine, I'll hug you.

856
01:00:00,287 --> 01:00:02,278
No! What are you...

857
01:00:03,287 --> 01:00:04,276
Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
What are you doing? Holy Mother of God! Oh, God!

858
01:00:05,287 --> 01:00:07,278
Now you're gonna feel a slight... jerk.

859
01:00:07,327 --> 01:00:09,283
You're so much more than a slight jerk!

860
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:11,276
That's not very nice.

861
01:00:15,287 --> 01:00:16,197
Whoa. Here we go!

862
01:00:18,287 --> 01:00:20,278
Jerry, Jerry, listen to me.
I need you to keep your weight centered!

863
01:00:21,287 --> 01:00:22,276
My weight's fine!

864
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:24,276
Help! Help!

865
01:00:25,287 --> 01:00:26,276
We're fine! Have a good night!

866
01:00:30,287 --> 01:00:32,278
Get control! Get control, you shlump!

867
01:00:33,287 --> 01:00:34,276
You're not exactly helping things, Jer.

868
01:00:35,287 --> 01:00:37,278
Helping how?

869
01:00:38,287 --> 01:00:39,163
Unwrap your legs.

870
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:40,163
What? Unwrap your legs.

871
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:41,163
Unwrap your legs!

872
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:42,163
All right!

873
01:00:42,287 --> 01:00:43,163
Thank you.

874
01:00:43,287 --> 01:00:45,278
I guess I forgot to take parachute etiquette
when I went to medical school! This isn't fun.

875
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:50,279
You gotta stop and smell those roses, budski.

876
01:00:51,287 --> 01:00:53,278
Oh, don't ever use that expression again! Ever!

877
01:00:55,287 --> 01:01:00,281
Whoo-hoo-ho! Oh! We're about to get impaled by... that!

878
01:01:01,287 --> 01:01:04,279
What the hell is that?

879
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:06,163
I don't know. I've always hated it.

880
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,163
Jer?

881
01:01:07,287 --> 01:01:09,278
Oh, God. Hold on to me! I'll hold on to you! Oh

882
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:12,278
It's okay.
We're down. Easy, Jer.

883
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:20,278
Get it off me! I'm choking!

884
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:24,278
All right, all right, all right!
We're safe and sound.

885
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:26,276
Oh, we're neither!

886
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:33,279
Oh, we are.

887
01:01:34,287 --> 01:01:35,276
Okay pal, let's get the hell out of here.

888
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:37,163
No! No! I am done!

889
01:01:37,287 --> 01:01:38,163
What?

890
01:01:38,287 --> 01:01:39,163
I'm finished with you! I mean it!

891
01:01:39,287 --> 01:01:41,278
What do you, what do you mean?

892
01:01:42,287 --> 01:01:44,278
A minute ago when I thought I was gonna die,
you want to know what image is in my head?

893
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:47,278
No.

894
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:52,280
I'm thinking of that look my daughter gave me up there.

895
01:01:53,287 --> 01:01:54,276
Uh-huh.

896
01:01:58,287 --> 01:01:59,276
I've given her all these things she doesn't want
and the one time she needs me, where am I? I'm with you!

897
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:01,163
Something you should work on, Jer.

898
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:05,278
What did you say?

899
01:02:06,287 --> 01:02:11,281
I said...

900
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:17,281
I have to work on that?
The worst father in the universe is telling me I gotta work on something?

901
01:02:18,287 --> 01:02:23,281
Do you know in the last three months I have spent almost every day with your kid?
Do you know that? Have you seen him even once?

902
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:11,161
You want to do something about it, fanny boy?

903
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:12,961
I do. I really do.

904
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:14,048
Let's go.

905
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:18,165
Come on! Bring it on! You wanna fight me?
Three rounds. Let's do it the right way. He'll referee, we'll

906
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:23,161
It was before I even met you.

907
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:26,163
It doesn't bother me that you went out with someone before
you met me! I went out with other guys!

908
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:29,163
Yeah, but that's not even You went out with other guys?
What guys?

909
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:32,163
I've told you about them and that's the thing!
You weren't as honest with me as I was with you!

910
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:36,164
And by the way, can you just tell me what your dad really does?

911
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:39,163
Because he's got a few too many Prada
and Gucci outfits to be a Xerox salesman!

912
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:41,161
I can't say.

913
00:00:43,172 --> 00:00:44,161
What?

914
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:50,166
I mean, I, really, I'm not allowed to say
He made me vow and I gave him my word.

915
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:53,163
How good is your word?

916
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:58,165
Okay. I just think you're feeling a little nervous about the wedding.

917
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:02,164
Don't tell me what I'm feeling! My father does that!

918
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:34,161
So what are you doing?

919
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:45,161
Just confirming. Cherkasov's got her
in position five miles offshore.

920
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,163
Thibodoux's guy is en route and they're
both set for a noon ex change time.

921
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:51,170
I guess I can squeeze it in between the
I do"s and the appetizers.

922
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:57,163
Unless you think I'm ready to take the lead.

923
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:01,161
Ex cuse me.

924
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:02,167
That's what I thought.

925
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:06,164
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

926
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:35,163
Push everything back.

927
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:36,167
Meaning what?

928
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:41,165
The whole ex change. Cherkasov, Thibodoux, the money, everything
Put it off until tomorrow night when the kids are on their honeymoon.

929
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:43,161
I thought you were gonna juggle both. You always do.

930
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:45,168
Anj, I am tired of juggling.

931
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:48,163
Cherkasov and Thibodoux are not gonna like this.

932
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:49,167
Well, they can kiss my ass.

933
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:50,167
Fair enough.

934
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:54,164
Did you get the tux edos from the drycleaners?

935
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,161
I sure did.

936
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:58,161
What about the pictures?

937
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:01,163
Jacket pocket. Anything else?

938
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:03,161
You look very nice this evening.

939
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:06,161
Thank you.

940
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:12,161
Ow!

941
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:15,170
What are you doing?

942
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:19,164
Well, I'm just waiting for you
Mister Bright-Eyes.

943
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:21,161
You dressed me?
Yes, I did.

944
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:26,164
So Jer, we gotta talk.
I know we've had our differences but our son and

945
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:28,168
daughter are going to be married and, you know,
whether we like it or not

946
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:32,171
we're stuck with each other.
Yeah.

947
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,161
So you knocked some sense into me father-wise and,

948
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:39,165
uh, I'm going to be changing my lifestyle. No more shenanigans.

949
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:43,161
And I'm not working today.

950
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:45,161
Does the FBI know about this?

951
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:51,163
Uh, it's not gonna be a problem. This wedding is gonna
be as normal as butter on mashed potatoes.

952
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:53,161
Come on, let's go.

953
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:11,041
Freeze!

954
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:15,164
Like butter on mashed potatoes, huh
That lasted about ten minutes.

955
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,161
Jer, just relax.

956
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:20,163
Hutchins, do you have kids?

957
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:25,161
I have a Jack Russell Terrier.

958
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:27,168
You're kidding me!

959
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:29,161
Well, then you'll understand.
You gotta give me two hours.

960
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:33,960
This is my son's wedding.
You can do anything you want to me afterwards.

961
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:37,164
You can take me out back, shoot me, be a hero.

962
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:39,161
But let me see my boy get married.

963
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:41,161
Or...

964
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:43,161
Hey, hey, hey!

965
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:45,048
Ah!

966
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:47,049
Well, maybe you ought to just see this.

967
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:48,161
What?

968
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:06,166
Where'd you get? This was in college, man!
I was pledging!

969
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:07,167
wow.

970
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:10,048
Hutch, thanks so much.

971
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:11,161
That's a big pair of heels.
Yeah, thank you.

972
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:12,167
We'll send out some cake later.

973
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:14,161
Bye.

974
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:16,161
Yeah, we'll be right here!

975
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:21,163
That was fun!
Yeah. Blackmail. //lt's terrific.

976
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:26,161
Hi!

977
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:27,167
Jerry!

978
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:29,161
Uncle Ben! Mazeltov!
Thanks.

979
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:32,161
Where's Mark and Melissa?

980
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:34,168
Where are they?

981
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:36,161
No, I don't know. Where are they?

982
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,167
Yeah, I don't know. Where are they?

983
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,042
Ben, I'm asking you. I'm asking you.
I'm asking you.

984
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,161
All right, stop! Stop it! We're turning into Abbott and Costello.

985
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:41,161
Doctor Peyser.
Hi, Rabbi.

986
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:45,050
I noticed we're already behind schedule and I do have

987
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:47,162
two otherceremonies this afternoon and that Buddhist
monk that I'm supposed to do the ceremony with

988
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:48,167
That was not my idea. Uh, what's wrong with him? He's an idiot.

989
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:53,164
Okay. Well, uh, let me talk to him.

990
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:55,161
Thank you.

991
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:56,167
Of course.

992
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:59,170
I don't know one person here! Not one person!

993
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:03,171
That's right, because it's not an arms convention
Talk to these guys.

994
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:06,161
Hey, guys!

995
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,167
Hi.

996
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:08,042
Who are you?

997
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,161
Mark's frat brothers. Who are you?

998
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:11,161
I'm Mark's dad!

999
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:12,042
No, seriously?

1000
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,161
Yeah! Hm.
Mark never mentioned he had a dad.

1001
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:15,048
Hm-mm.

1002
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:16,161
Like, not ever.

1003
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:17,167
Well, I'm traveling a lot.

1004
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:21,164
Oh, I just assumed that you were dead or in jail.

1005
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:23,048
Uh-huh. Me, too.

1006
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:24,048
Well, fuck you very much and have another beer.
Thanks a lot.

1007
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:31,165
Mister... Monk, uh, if you two can't work this out
the planet is doomed! What can I do? Just talk to her.

1008
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:34,170
Ex cuse me, Doctor Peyser!

1009
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:36,161
Hi.

1010
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,167
Gloria... from before.

1011
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:38,167
Yeah, Gloria. Yeah, I know you. Hi, Gloria.

1012
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:39,167
Um, have you seen Melissa?

1013
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:40,167
No, where is she?

1014
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:45,161
I'm a little worried. I got really wasted last night and
I did this kind of My Best Friend's Wedding" thing and

1015
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:47,168
told her I dated Mark one time.

1016
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:49,161
You what?

1017
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:51,168
I think she may have bolted!

1018
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:53,161
I can't

1019
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:01,164
So... I thought you'd like to know the wedding is off.

1020
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,161
Why? What happened?

1021
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:04,167
Mark and Melissa have vanished. They're not even here!

1022
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:07,163
Jerry, calm down. It's all gonna be all right.

1023
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:13,165
Melissa? Melissa?

1024
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:36,166
hey! Hi! I'll be right ba Melissa! Melissa
I know you're a little stressed out.

1025
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:39,170
Well, so am I. You know, it's a big day and
you know, you're confused.

1026
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:42,163
I was confused on the day I got married. Obviously.

1027
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,164
Anyway, I've never seen Mark happier in his
life and I know it's because of you and

1028
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:49,170
I get down on my knees and I thank that Big
Man Up There for you coming into his life.

1029
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:55,162
And to tell you that the second I saw you
I knew. You're the best girl in the world.

1030
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:58,048
Hi, Steve.

1031
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,161
Oh, my God!

1032
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:15,163
What are you doing in that dress?

1033
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:16,167
I won't be the bridesmaid anymore
Do you understand?

1034
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:19,163
No! No, not really!
No! "I taught you everything you know

1035
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:23,171
When you're ready, you can take the lead
Well, I'm ready and I'm taking the lead.

1036
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:29,166
I don't want to end up like you, Steve
No personal life. A family that hates you!

1037
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:33,164
I choose happiness! It's really a
breakthrough for me! Now where's the money?

1038
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:36,163
It's in a case in the warehouse.

1039
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:39,163
The case in the warehouse is empty
We want the money.

1040
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,048
We?

1041
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,163
Hi!

1042
00:08:58,172 --> 00:08:59,161
Jesus Christ. Oh, God.

1043
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:11,163
What a lovely setting
I see your touch in the decor, no?

1044
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:13,168
I... worked with a designer a little.

1045
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:15,168
Why, it's wonderful.

1046
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:18,163
I was on my way here, ex cited about my submarine
and then I realized something.

1047
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:23,165
Do you want to know what it was that I realized?

1048
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:24,167
Ah... sure.

1049
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:27,163
I was more ex cited to see you.

1050
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:28,167
Aw...

1051
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:32,164
I cannot get you out of my mind.

1052
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:33,167
Okay.

1053
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:37,164
I am attracted to you physically which for me
is strange because I find homosexuality disgusting!

1054
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:41,163
Okay, bu-but This is a big subject.

1055
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,167
Oh.

1056
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:46,164
And... you know, the wedding, so I-I actually have
to find my family. I'll talk to you later.

1057
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,161
I have them.

1058
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:53,048
You what?

1059
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:54,161
What are you doing in that?

1060
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:59,165
So, Steven, I see you have met my partner.

1061
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:00,167
Yeah, you make a... lovely couple.

1062
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:02,161
So where's Cherkasov?

1063
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:05,163
Dead.

1064
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,163
What about Olga?

1065
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,161
Steven Tobias, you son of a bitch!

1066
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:16,167
If we don't die I'm gonna kill you, Dad! You suck!

1067
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:17,167
Jerry, what's going on here?

1068
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:20,164
Daddy, what the hell is going on?
Where have you been? She's wearing my dress!

1069
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:21,167
Quiet!

1070
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:28,165
If I give you the money,
will you leave everybody here unharmed?

1071
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,048
Of course.

1072
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,161
Uh, hi. Uh, since we can't find the bride and the groom we're just
gonna open up the bar. So everybody have a cocktail! Woo-hoo!

1073
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:49,161
Oh, that would've made a great gift.

1074
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:55,163
Now, get out.

1075
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:03,163
Are you coming, sweet Cobra?

1076
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:09,161
Daddy, this is weird.

1077
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:11,168
Where you going, Jerry?

1078
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,161
I'm sorry, Katherine.

1079
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:23,163
Can I talk to you alone for one second? Lt's about us.

1080
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:24,167
We don't have time to dilly-dally.

1081
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,167
Pull around the boat.

1082
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:26,167
What is it, darling?

1083
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:35,166
What am I to you, exactly? A plaything? Or a toy?

1084
00:11:35,212 --> 00:11:36,042
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1085
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:38,161
Okay.

1086
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:39,167
So let's do this the right way.

1087
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:40,167
Jean-Pierre, I love you.

1088
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:42,168
And I want you to be my wife!

1089
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:44,161
How's your plantar faciitis now?!

1090
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,048
Help!

1091
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,161
Jean-Pierre, come on, we have to go! Jean-Pierre!

1092
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,164
I keep making myself vulnerable.

1093
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:03,161
Focus on revenge.

1094
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:04,167
Revanche.

1095
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:11,164
Well, Steve, you have ruined this darling girl's wedding.

1096
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:12,167
Oh, no, no, I'm-I'm okay.

1097
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:16,163
No, you're not!
You will carry the scar of this day until you die!

1098
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:18,168
All right, I guess I am kind of sad.

1099
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,161
Judy, how is this helpful?

1100
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:23,170
Would both of you, please just stop it!

1101
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:25,161
Why don't you give me a break, huh?

1102
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:27,161
Ooh, I'll break your neck!

1103
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:30,163
That's good, Mark. Express your anger!

1104
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:34,048
You want a piece of me?

1105
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:35,048
Oh, you bet I do!

1106
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,161
Here it goes!

1107
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:44,048
Oh, my God!

1108
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:45,161
What was that?

1109
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:49,161
The one time my dad showed up at Cub Scouts
I earned a merit badge in Covert Evasion Techniques.

1110
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:50,042
What happened?

1111
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:56,048
We broke up.

1112
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:00,048
What is that?

1113
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:11,048
That, my friend, is Olga.

1114
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:15,161
In Lake Michigan? So much for homeland security.

1115
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,042
Uh-oh.

1116
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,161
I'm ex cited to go on a submarine!

1117
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:28,161
What was your name again?

1118
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:32,161
It's Angela.

1119
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,042
Oh.

1120
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:35,161
Good-bye, Angela.

1121
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:39,161
What are you doing?

1122
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:40,042
Taking preventative measures.

1123
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:41,048
To prevent what? Maybe a torpedo heading towards the wedding
What? Well, I'm-I'm gonna come with you.

1124
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:42,048
Sorry, buddy. It's a one-man job.

1125
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:48,164
You drag me halfway around the world when I don't want to go!
The one time I want to you say, "No"?

1126
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:53,163
It's my family too! I'm going! You can't stop me!

1127
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:55,161
Wow, Jer. Get on.

1128
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,042
On this? Oh, jeez.

1129
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,161
Okay.

1130
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,163
What is the plan?

1131
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:10,163
The Juliet Class torpedo has an acoustic guidance system.

1132
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,163
It tracks whatever's making the most noise.
So if he pulls the trigger, we've got to divert the torpedo.

1133
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:18,168
Towards what?

1134
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:21,163
Let me rephrase the question.
What does the torpedo wind up hitting?

1135
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:23,161
You said you wanted to help!

1136
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:25,161
Oh, my God, that's before I knew the plan!
That's a terrible plan!

1137
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:37,163
Stop jacking off and prepare the torpedo!

1138
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:40,170
Immediately, quick, quick, you fools!

1139
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,161
Give me that!

1140
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:56,048
How're you doing? You doing okay?

1141
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:59,163
Um... yeah. You know, I... got a few questions, like...

1142
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:05,164
what the hell is happening?

1143
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:12,166
My father is in the CIA. He works deep undercover and
I've spent my entire life hiding that fact, but that's the truth.

1144
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,167
I dated a few skanky girls before I met you.

1145
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:17,171
I, uh, don't really like being a lawyer.

1146
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:24,168
I played with, uh, Legos until I was seventeen and, uh
I go to a colorist because I'm prematurely gray. It's a rinse.

1147
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:25,167
Really?

1148
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,048
You see, I don't want to hide anything from you anymore
because I don't care! All I care about is you!

1149
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:34,048
Mark!

1150
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:35,161
What?

1151
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:37,161
I love you.

1152
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:48,166
What are we doing now? Why are we turning?

1153
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:55,163
Make noise!

1154
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:58,161
Quiet! No noise!

1155
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,163
Wait! Wait! I've got something in my fanny pack!

1156
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:09,163
Look!

1157
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:11,048
I'll never make a crack again!

1158
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:16,161
Yes, 'cause we'll be dead!

1159
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:18,161
Hold on! Hold on!

1160
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:38,161
I'm gonna throw up!

1161
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,161
It's coming at us!

1162
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:42,161
Boop-ba-bada, beep-ba-bada, ba-ba, uh-uh-uh-

1163
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:49,161
Could you stop that please?

1164
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:50,042
Touchy.

1165
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:51,161
All in all, I'm glad I met you!

1166
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:03,161
Me too, buddy! I mean it!

1167
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:05,168
You're the real thing!

1168
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:07,161
I'm sorry I called you the worst father in the world!
I really didn't mean it!

1169
00:17:08,172 --> 00:17:10,163
Thank you, Jer.

1170
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:11,167
I'm sure there's at least two or three guys that are worse!

1171
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:14,163
Whoo! That's so awesome!

1172
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:04,161
Mark? Mark? Honey? Honey! Honey!
Are you okay? Baby, are you okay?

1173
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:07,161
Yeah... but there's cake in my shorts.

1174
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:09,161
Wait, wait...

1175
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:22,048
We're gonna go freshen up.

1176
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:28,166
Are you guys all right?

1177
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:37,161
Steve, we just wanted to let you know
this was the worst wedding we have ever been to.

1178
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:44,166
You should thank Jerry. He put it all together.

1179
00:19:44,212 --> 00:19:45,167
Thanks for coming.

1180
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:47,161
We gotta do something about this. Come on.

1181
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:50,163
I know you all got a lot of questions, but listen up.

1182
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:51,042
I am deep cover CIA, case number three-nine-two-four.

1183
00:19:58,172 --> 00:20:06,170
Peter Markell's my sole contact at the Agency.

1184
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,163
All right, well, we're gonna check that out.

1185
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:15,528
You know, you almost blew my cover a few times.

1186
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:16,163
But I don't want an apology, because
I think I got a way that you can make it up.

1187
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:22,166
And do you, Melissa, take Mark to be your wedded husband...

1188
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:29,168
to have and to hold from this day forward
for better or worse, for richer or poorer

1189
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:33,171
in sickness and in health, till death do you part?

1190
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:35,048
I do.

1191
00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:42,169
By the power vested in me, by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. I now pronounce you man and wife.

1192
00:20:42,212 --> 00:20:43,167
You may kiss the bride.

1193
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:45,168
Whoo-hoo! Yeah.

1194
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:55,161
Mazeltov!

1195
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:19,164
You know how I run around and try to save the world?

1196
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,167
Dad, it's okay.

1197
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:26,164
No, no. What I want you to know is you are my world
Mark. I'm so proud of you.

1198
00:21:27,172 --> 00:21:28,161
Congratulations.

1199
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:43,050
I know we fought a lot, Judy, but we must
have done something right. He's a great kid.

1200
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:47,165
And you're a very good mother.

1201
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:53,161
Thank you.

1202
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,167
You're welcome.

1203
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:58,164
And I still hate you.

1204
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:03,165
But I do have a room back at the club.

1205
00:22:08,172 --> 00:22:09,161
I am so sorry about the wedding.

1206
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:12,045
What are you talking about?
Daddy, don't you realize?

1207
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:14,163
What?

1208
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:18,171
This is exactly what I wanted.

1209
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:23,165
Six people on a beach.

1210
00:22:24,172 --> 00:22:27,164
Good.

1211
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,042
I love you.

1212
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:29,048
Thank you.

1213
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:30,161
Oh, I love you too.

1214
00:22:31,172 --> 00:22:32,048
Thanks.

1215
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:40,163
Six people on a beach.
I coulda saved a fortune!

1216
00:22:43,172 --> 00:22:49,168
Jer, you're gonna be fine.

1217
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:54,161
As a matter of fact, the whole family
they're gonna be just fine.

1218
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:06,164
Oh! Cobra! Fat Cobra!
It's all right, darling! I, I forgive you!

1219
00:23:10,172 --> 00:24:12,169
You know something? He might actually like prison.

1220
00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:17,161
Like it? He's gonna love it!

1221
00:24:19,172 --> 00:24:21,163
Guys! A little help would be nice!
