1
00:00:27,364 --> 00:00:29,457
Thousands took to the streets
and thousands kill...

2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,660
Many peaceful protesting monks have been 
killed, some burnt alive and others drowned..

3
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:36,868
Foreign journalists have been shot and caned..

4
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:40,600
Thousands of villages have been destroyed.
Rape and torture are a daily occurrence.

5
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:43,404
In Burma there are more landmines,
than anywhere in the world.

6
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:47,100
Young men are bitten and forced into 
the army. Many as young as 12 years old.

7
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,150
Beheadings and mutilations
are common.

8
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:54,022
The Karen people comprising mostly of poor Christian
farmers have been singled out for extermination.

9
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:58,452
The military government wants many of
the abundance resources on the Karen land.

10
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:02,663
The bloody military campaign against the Karen
people has been going on for almost 60 years.

11
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:05,737
The longest radical war in the world.

12
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Ready. Send them out!

13
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,700
Move!

14
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,900
Shoot them all!

15
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,300
OK.

16
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Looks like dangerous work.

17
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I am Michael Burnett.

18
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,150
Do you have some time to talk?

19
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:21,865
Won't take too long, I promise.

20
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,700
I was told it might be possible to 
rent your boat. We like to do that.

21
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,865
Is that possible?

22
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
We need to get up river.

23
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:29,500
Where are you going?

24
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Into Burma.

25
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,865
Burma is a war zone.

26
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,700
That's what people call it.

27
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:36,500
But it's more like genocide than war.

28
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,900
This will be my fifth trip in,

29
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
we are aware of all the risk.

30
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,800
I don't go that far north.

31
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,965
Let me explain our situation.

32
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
Our church is part of the Pan-Asia
ministry..

33
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,000
located in Colorado.

34
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,200
We are all volunteers, whom
around this time of the year,

35
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,500
bring in medical supplies, 
medical attention..

36
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,465
prayer books and support to the 
Karen tribe's people.

37
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,300
People say you know the river 
better than anyone.

38
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:07,300
They lied.

39
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,100
What I am asking is, we compensate you...

40
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,800
for a few hours of your time..

41
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,300
to help change people's lives.

42
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,200
Are you bringing in any weapons?

43
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,050
Of course not.

44
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,400
You are not changing anything.

45
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,000
It's thinking like that,
that keeps the world the way it is.

46
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:31,200
F..k the world.

47
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,500
- Let's go
- Why?

48
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:36,700
He's not interested.

49
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,000
- Let me try.
- Sara...

50
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,600
It'll be an interesting trip going up there.

51
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:41,500
What do we have to lose?.

52
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,200
Let me try.

53
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,200
Sarah.

54
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,000
Hello?

55
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,900
I am Sarah Miller. Hope you don't
mind me coming back here.

56
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,200
The man you were talking to...

57
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:05,300
I wasn't talking to anybody.

58
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,765
Ok, the man that was talking to you..

59
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,900
asked if we could hire your boat
to go up river.

60
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
and you said no, why?

61
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:17,500
Can't help you out.

62
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,400
If you have some reasons,
mind if I heard them?

63
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,300
Go home.

64
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Why did you come back?

65
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,300
Waiting for you.

66
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,300
I told you before,
I can't help you.

67
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
We need to know why you
can't help these people.

68
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
We are here to make a difference.

69
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,600
We believe all lives are special.

70
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:13,867
Some lives, some no.

71
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:15,065
Really?

72
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,500
If everyone thought like you,
nothing will ever change.

73
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,100
Nothing will change.

74
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,165
Of course it does.
Nothing stays the same.

75
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,850
Value your life, it's a good one

76
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:23,500
It's what I am trying to do!

77
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,000
No, what you are trying to do
is change what is.

78
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:28,200
And what is?

79
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,600
Go home.

80
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,800
Really.
Go home.

81
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,065
Maybe...

82
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,800
Maybe you lost your faith in people.

83
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,200
But you feel the same for something.
You must still care for something.

84
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Maybe we can't change what it is,

85
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,600
But trying to save a life,
isn't wasting your life. Is it?

86
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,000
As bad as these people are,
they will eventually lose.

87
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:48,900
They can't keep it up against a united front.

88
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:49,700
They can't!

89
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,600
Time alone will tell. In the meantime,
we just got to hold it together.

90
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Just the other day...

91
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,600
Excuse me, Sara?

92
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,450
Where are you going?

93
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:02,200
To talk to him.

94
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,100
He'll probably want his privacy.

95
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,800
Michael, you shouldn't worry,
he's helping us.

96
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:07,217
He's being paid.

97
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:08,800
He didn't take anything.

98
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,700
Thank you again for doing this.

99
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,300
Really from all of us.

100
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,300
You never told us your name.

101
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,800
John.

102
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,500
Where are you from?

103
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,800
Arizona.

104
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,300
- Why did you leave?
- I got drafted in Vietnam.

105
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:34,900
And you just stayed?

106
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,700
It's complicated.

107
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,800
You have a family back home?

108
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Father maybe.
I don't know.

109
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,100
Aren't you curious to see what
might have changed back home?

110
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,600
Don't have a reason for that.

111
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,700
Sara.

112
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,900
Because of you we going,
I'll approve it..

113
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,300
anytime you want to turn around...

114
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,000
...it is done.

115
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,600
Ok.

116
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,600
What is it?
Who are they?

117
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:01,100
Burmese pirates.

118
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,300
Everyone sit down,
don't make a sound.

119
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,100
- It's all right.
- Don't talk.

120
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,700
- Are there more of them?
- Maybe.

121
00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:48,300
We will know?

122
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,700
We should keep going.
We made a commitment.

123
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,300
I ain't talking to you.

124
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,800
What do you want to do? - We are a
group here. They want to vote. Vote.

125
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:58,365
Sit down!

126
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,800
If it is money they want...

127
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,200
Nobody talks. Heads down!

128
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,900
What are you doing?

129
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,800
We come here to stop the killing.
Who are you to kill?

130
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:16,765
- Who are you?
- Let him go!

131
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,500
You want them to rape her
fifty times and cut her head off!

132
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,567
Who are you?

133
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:24,500
Who are any of you?

134
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:27,901
We are going back.

135
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,000
No. We shouldn't go back!

136
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,065
Let go.

137
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,900
- What are you doing?
- We are so close!

138
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:42,865
What has happened here is horrible...

139
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,100
But what the people in there are
being killed like this every day.

140
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:52,600
Michael this was your idea.
We made a commitment.

141
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:55,500
I know you don't believe
in what we are doing,

142
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,100
But it is our lives.

143
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:58,500
Our choice.

144
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,900
You are not going to change anything.

145
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,465
Please

146
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,100
Please John.

147
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,000
Please

148
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,200
Go sit down.

149
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,300
We are taking the overland route on the way
back, so there is no need to wait around.

150
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,600
I have to report this.

151
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,600
I know you think what you did is right,..

152
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:32,600
but taking a life is never right.

153
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,300
I don't know what to say.

154
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Maybe you shouldn't say anything.
Should you? Good Luck.

155
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,200
KLAW KBE LO LANDSBYEN.

156
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,200
Open your mouth.

157
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,100
We signify your faith with
this little flower, ok?

158
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,500
Hey dear. Can you hand
over the bandages?

159
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:08,499
Get out of here!
What about them?  Go on, take them!

160
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,400
......calling Raven.

161
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:38,000
Over...

162
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
What am I?

163
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,000
We made you this way.
You are a full blooded combat soldier.

164
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,600
Talk to me Johnny!

165
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,865
You don't just turn it off!

166
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,500
- It's over!
- Nothing is over!

167
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,200
Aren't you curious how things
might have changed back home?

168
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,965
You have done enough damage!

169
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,300
You will always be tearing away soldier..

170
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,765
till you come to terms with what you are.

171
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,400
So you are just going to stay here forever?

172
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,200
John Rambo!

173
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
John.

174
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,800
John Rambo.

175
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,800
My name is Arthur Marsh.

176
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,500
Pastor of Christ Church Colorado.

177
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,700
I need to talk with you.

178
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,000
It is very important, otherwise
I won't come here like this.

179
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,900
The morning of the day the group left,..

180
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,465
Michael Burnet notified me...

181
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,400
that they were traveling through this location.

182
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,500
What happened?

183
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,100
No one knows exactly.

184
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,400
They will supposed to return 10 days ago,
but they never came back.

185
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,600
I requested help from the embassy,
but they can't help.

186
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,400
Not in Burma and not in time.

187
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,900
How do you know they are alive?.

188
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,900
Because we have been in contact
with the Karen freedom fighters,

189
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:17,000
who say they think they know
where they were taken.

190
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,400
I was given the name of an ex-military
American local from the embassy..

191
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,100
who put me in touch with men who say they 
have experience in this part of the world.

192
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:25,900
Mercenaries?

193
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,000
Yes.

194
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,565
I don't have any other choice.

195
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,600
You know the exact spot.
We need you to take these men,

196
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:38,800
to where you let our people off.

197
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,400
When are they ready to leave?

198
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,600
When you are.

199
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,000
You know what you are.

200
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,400
What you are made off.

201
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,300
War is in your blood.

202
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,500
Don't fight it.

203
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,900
Did you kill for your country?

204
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Did you kill for yourself?

205
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,400
God is never going to make that go away.

206
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,500
When you are pushed...

207
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,200
Killing is as easy as breathing.

208
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,050
Look at this f..king place!

209
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:10,192
Only a f..king ape would live here?

210
00:33:10,227 --> 00:33:12,300
What am I doing here?

211
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:15,000
Hey, knock that shit off!

212
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,765
And you don't like the arts?

213
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,200
And you don't like the shit.
I like your sister, Diaz.

214
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,800
She got a thing for retards.

215
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,500
Hey boatman!

216
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,900
How much longer in this ancient piece of shit?

217
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
What did the reverent say?

218
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,700
Something about his flock went missing.

219
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,350
I said look mate, that is what you get
when you're trespassing into Burma.

220
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:41,765
That's what you get, when you go around
sniffing other people's garbage.

221
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,800
You know those generals in there are making millions,
cranking up more than anyone in this planet.

222
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:46,700
Bullshit!

223
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,800
Millions, Moron. How do you
think they paid for that shit all ?

224
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:52,517
Try to read the papers
instead of sticking under it.

225
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:55,200
The general is the biggest junkies 
of all of them.

226
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,765
It's noble Louis..

227
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,800
You are? Those people going in 
without weapons.

228
00:34:00,835 --> 00:34:03,000
Just books and medicine.

229
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,500
It's noble.

230
00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:05,765
Ok, schoolboy!

231
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,900
You stick your nose in other people's 
business, you get f..k up...

232
00:34:07,935 --> 00:34:09,400
or you are dead.

233
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,350
The only reason I am doing this
is for an ex-wife and 3 kids.

234
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:15,000
and after the shit is over, you can
shove that right up your ass.

235
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:17,065
- Try to think careful, mate!
- Back off!

236
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,600
And you, I don't want to die of old age
before I get there. So move.

237
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,100
You said something?

238
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,400
S.P.D.C. LET INFANTERY BATTALION 360

239
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,400
Is it me? Or is it the air coming in 
smelling like some wet dog?

240
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,300
For f..k sake, I can swim faster than this.

241
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,400
- Am I right?
- We dead.

242
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,600
Chop, chop. The quicker we are there,
the quicker we get back.

243
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,800
Those idiots.

244
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,865
They come here..

245
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,700
start all the trouble...

246
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,600
... expecting the whole world to work
like their old neighbours. Well it doesn't..

247
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,900
So they send in the devil...

248
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,000
... to do god's work.
Ironic isn't it?

249
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,300
Am I boring you man?

250
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,200
Is it the trip? It's got you nervous?

251
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:17,997
Because we..

252
00:37:18,098 --> 00:37:20,398
...we really appreciate the action.
You know what I mean?

253
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:23,199
Look at me in the eyes if
you know what I am saying.

254
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Oh dear..

255
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,800
You are really an uptight master, 
aren't you?

256
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,850
You can drop the act in your stare.

257
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,000
I have seen it all before.

258
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,500
I am not impressed.

259
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,150
He's old school, SAS.

260
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:56,500
The first rate soldier to be 
told to go maniac.

261
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,000
They call him schoolboy.

262
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,100
The name stuck with him since.

263
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,000
The name he start calling me
no matter how many people I shoot.

264
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,300
What do you want from us?

265
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,000
One man and a kid in a chicken coop.

266
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:26,265
This sort of rebel they put up.

267
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,200
I am not liking it You are in a jungle, 
there is nothing to like.

268
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,665
How are you doing?

269
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,300
My name is Bieth, this is Tha.

270
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,600
This is it?

271
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,665
What's with the kid?

272
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,900
He's a good tracker.
We don't need a tracker. We need a guide.

273
00:39:41,935 --> 00:39:43,500
You know the exact location right?

274
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:45,200
10 km west.

275
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,450
To north 6 km walk.
- How many soldiers?

276
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:50,865
- 100 maybe.
- 100?

277
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,065
Heard what he said.
- More soldiers coming tomorrow.

278
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,000
I know I'm just a white trash
full of blanks, but I can count.

279
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,100
...stop f..king with the 100 strong.
Alright, alright!

280
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,165
Let's get this straight.

281
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,100
We don't engage anybody.
If we can extract these people, good.

282
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,900
It's in, out, clean, or we go off.

283
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,200
Somebody want to tell me
what the boatman is doing?

284
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,865
Why don't you wait with the boat.

285
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,500
- My man will stay with the boat.
- Your boat, you stay here.

286
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,000
I won't slow you down.

287
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,500
No, you won't.
It's not a nature hunt?

288
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,199
You can believe that.
He can be with me at the back.

289
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,300
He stays here. He's the boatman.
He stays with the boat.

290
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:27,000
Only a white man with a f..king dick.

291
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,400
Who has the explosives?

292
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,100
I've got some C4.

293
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,800
- I’ve got a claymore.
- Alright.

294
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:39,500
Let's go on with it.
Come on, move.

295
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:22,301
What is that?  ### bomb.
English dropped it in World War II.

296
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,100
Your people taken from here.

297
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,600
In my life, I've seen some shit.

298
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,500
But I've seen no shit like this.

299
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,100
Check it out!

300
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,500
All these commies, kill everything,
People are dead here as warning.

301
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,900
Mines, everywhere.

302
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,700
Watch where you are walking.

303
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,900
- Alright let's move on.
- To what?

304
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,200
They even kill the dogs.
Those people are dead. I'm with Kenji.

305
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,900
At least to have a look see.

306
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,800
Check it out.
I'm with you.

307
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,100
Check what? They are 100 strong.

308
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,100
We told the man's money.
Hey, calm down.

309
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,465
We got to see what is wrong.

310
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,300
If anything is wrong, anything at all, 
we leave. Alright?

311
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,700
Yes.

312
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
I order.

313
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,100
Good.
This way.

314
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,600
- Army!
- Go!

315
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm going to fire at them.

316
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,700
No, if they don't make it back from where
the hell they came from, they'll be on to us.

317
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,800
Who are you boatman?
- Let's move. - Move?

318
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,200
They are going to come after us,
when these guys don't show up.

319
00:46:07,235 --> 00:46:09,100
We don't need this shit.
We are going back to the boat.

320
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,000
Any of you boys want to shoot,
now is the time.

321
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:31,200
Any reason one of us just
doesn't want to surprise us.

322
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:32,900
But this is what we do.

323
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,600
Who we are.

324
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,800
Live for nothing.

325
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,200
Or die for something.

326
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,600
Your call!

327
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,200
What's your call?
Let's move.

328
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:40,363
Once Schoolboy's on the tower, we've 
got 15 mins. Set your watches to 1:45.

329
00:47:40,398 --> 00:47:41,928
And we won't wait for anybody.

330
00:47:41,963 --> 00:47:46,362
We meet at the base of the tower.
We don't meet up there, we f..ked.

331
00:47:48,162 --> 00:47:50,162
All set?
Set!

332
00:49:03,957 --> 00:49:05,257
Go!

333
00:49:12,356 --> 00:49:14,156
Go!

334
00:49:20,855 --> 00:49:21,855
Go!

335
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:53,849
Don't talk. Hear me out.

336
00:50:55,749 --> 00:50:56,714
Where is the girl?

337
00:50:56,749 --> 00:51:00,348
She's over there.
Go untie him. I'll be back again.

338
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:26,047
Here!

339
00:51:28,846 --> 00:51:32,046
There's two in the cage.
Near the pitch. Get them.

340
00:53:57,936 --> 00:54:01,035
Come on!

341
00:55:54,527 --> 00:55:55,392
Let's move!

342
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:56,827
Where is the boatman?
And Sarah.

343
00:55:56,926 --> 00:55:58,826
15 minutes. That's the deal.
We're leaving.

344
00:55:58,927 --> 00:56:00,392
Let's go!
5 more minutes.

345
00:56:00,427 --> 00:56:01,627
Bullshit!
He knew the deal.

346
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:03,428
If we're getting away,
we f..king leave together!

347
00:56:03,562 --> 00:56:04,726
Your live.
Let's go!

348
00:56:04,727 --> 00:56:06,027
Not without her!

349
00:56:09,426 --> 00:56:12,226
Who do you think save your life?
We did.

350
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:15,526
Get up!

351
00:58:54,014 --> 00:58:56,014
- You got us covered?
- Yes.

352
00:58:56,914 --> 00:58:58,914
Why did you come back?
Why did you do?

353
00:59:01,614 --> 00:59:03,614
This way.

354
01:00:37,707 --> 01:00:40,707
My leg.
Hold still!

355
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,106
Shut up.
We got you. We're getting you out.

356
01:00:53,906 --> 01:00:55,971
His leg is broken!

357
01:00:56,006 --> 01:01:00,670
Where is the guide?
He's gone!

358
01:01:00,705 --> 01:01:02,705
- We're not going to make it to the river with him.
- Will you shut up.

359
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,505
Untie his lace.
Take of his boot.

360
01:01:04,605 --> 01:01:08,105
No! Leave his boot on.

361
01:01:08,905 --> 01:01:11,305
....I need a knife.

362
01:01:17,004 --> 01:01:18,504
- Is he going to make it?
- I don't know. Make him stretch.

363
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:20,404
Spread out!

364
01:01:43,902 --> 01:01:45,902
Take the point.

365
01:02:02,401 --> 01:02:06,101
Hear that?
They're tracking us.

366
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,400
- Turn around.
- What are you doing?

367
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,665
I want you two to go to the river.
The boat is waiting.

368
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,399
It's out there.
You can follow the shore line.

369
01:02:23,434 --> 01:02:26,499
- What about you?
- I'll be alright.

370
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:28,199
Give me the claymine.

371
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:30,999
- Fire of a shot.
- What?

372
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:33,699
Fire off a shot!

373
01:02:42,098 --> 01:02:44,098
Go! Go!

374
01:05:25,786 --> 01:05:27,486
Let's move.

375
01:05:48,785 --> 01:05:50,785
- Wait.
- Where are they?

376
01:05:56,384 --> 01:06:00,184
- Son of a bitch!
- Look

377
01:06:03,684 --> 01:06:05,783
Oh God!

378
01:06:15,283 --> 01:06:17,583
Oh damn it!

379
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:52,180
F..k you!

380
01:06:52,181 --> 01:06:53,181
Come on to me, you lady boy!

381
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,979
What did we do?
We did nothing.

382
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:47,976
What are we going to do?
We can't do anything.

383
01:10:51,363 --> 01:10:53,163
Karen rebels.

384
01:13:37,451 --> 01:13:39,151
Michael!

385
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:43,951
Michael!

386
01:14:19,152 --> 01:14:21,052
Michael!

387
01:16:52,800 --> 01:17:02,800
THE END
