1
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,796
Step out of your vehicles.
Leave the car with the keys inside.

2
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,432
Take all personal belongings
with you to inspection.

3
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,999
Move on.

4
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,275
- Do you think I'm scared, Captain?
- You're never scared.

5
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,436
- Except when you're scared.
- Then you're really scared.

6
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,869
Why don't you get out of here
and we'll both feel better?

7
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,316
- I can take this trip alone.
- No!

8
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,957
Look at it, Karen, please.

9
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,116
- Shit! It keeps doing that.
- Don't lift your arms up.

10
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,632
I guess I can't salute.

11
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,598
Get out of the car, please.

12
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,156
Step out of your vehicle.
Leave the car with the keys inside.

13
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,950
Take all personal belongings
with you to inspection.

14
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,710
Identification.

15
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,156
TraveI authorization to Vancouver.

16
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,431
Let me guess, the big one's hers.
Am I right or am I right?

17
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,199
I've never known it to fall. They
change clothes three times a day.

18
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,917
- We've got a positive here.
- No, there must be a mistake!

19
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,194
Goddamn breeders!
You think they'd learn.

20
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,511
- Some never do.
- Ain't that the truth.

21
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,434
- Next.
- Your turn.

22
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,759
Negative. Proceed.

23
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,078
Hey, come on.

24
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,236
- Don't forget her favourite dress.
- Thanks. I'm just so tired.

25
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,595
I've been driving all night.

26
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,319
This bitch
is trying to get past our machines!

27
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,671
Goddman fucking flack jacket!

28
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,159
Run! Go!

29
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,997
You're under arrest. Stand up and
keep your hands away from your body.

30
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,230
Hold your position.
Put your hands over your head.

31
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,472
You are under arrest.

32
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,797
I did a feature on this place.
It's enormous.

33
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,952
- Like your mouth.
- It's got no windows.

34
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,714
Attention, prisoners.

35
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,474
You are entering the Fortress.

36
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,636
A private maximum-security prison
run by the Men-Tel Corporation.

37
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,874
I onIy bounced a couple of cheques
and they give me maximum security.

38
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,157
It's located in a secluded desert.

39
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,916
No life can survive here.
Escape is impossible.

40
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,831
- 60 days I've got to do.
- That's short-term, man.

41
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,470
- You're only taking a nap.
- I never nap.

42
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,679
- What did they get you for?
- My wife was pregnant again.

43
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,593
One wasn't enough?

44
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,036
- He died at birth.
- Didn't they tie her tubes?

45
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,829
They said they did.
I guess we got lucky.

46
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,518
- Lucky? What did they give you?
- 31 years.

47
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,232
- Why the fuck are you smlling?
- She got away.

48
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,555
This is a complete security
environment. Crime does not pay.

49
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,997
It's 30 stories high.
How can it be invisible?

50
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,995
Calm down.
Take a deep breath.

51
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,438
- Forget him. He's dead.
- He's just scared, okay?

52
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,275
The scared don't survive inside.

53
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,270
All right, everybody, strip.

54
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,398
Now!

55
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,314
All prisoners,
your attention, please.

56
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,119
Welcome to the Fortress.

57
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,239
Everything here is the property
of the Men-Tel Corporation.

58
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,155
Including you.
I am Prison Director Poe.

59
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,077
The Federal Government pays Men-Tel
$27 a day for each one of you.

60
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,915
They expect us to put you to use
expanding our facility.

61
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,232
- Hidden weaponry.
- Open your mouth!

62
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,477
Spit it out and put it in the bin.

63
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,873
Your work shift will be determined
by our computer ZED-10.

64
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,636
You will learn to live
without day or night.

65
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,998
These are Psychological
Security lntelligence Systems.

66
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,550
P.S.l.S.

67
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,192
Your thoughts
will be with me ... always.

68
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,477
Put your heads in. Now!

69
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,432
Prepare intestinator tagging.

70
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,115
You are about to be outfitted
with intestinators.

71
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,398
Men-Tel's automatic
behaviour-control device.

72
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,755
Observe all rules.

73
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,833
Be especially observant
of the yellow and red lines.

74
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,788
Crossing a yellow line
will result in pain.

75
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,954
Crossing a red line
will result in death.

76
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,398
I have an illness.
It's called claustrophobia.

77
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,872
- It's a real illness!
- Don't do this.

78
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,430
Remain in line.
Do not cross the yellow line.

79
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,275
Nobody's listening to me!
I have a note from my doctor.

80
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,673
- Yellow is pain.
- I cannot stay here! Listen!

81
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,074
The intestinator
is now in pain mode.

82
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,312
Turn it off!

83
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,951
Do not cross the red line.
Red is death.

84
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,794
I told you. Dead on arrivaI.

85
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,553
The Fortress is the world's largest
underground penitentiary.

86
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,113
33 stories deep. Neutron cannons
are housed in the central core.

87
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,159
They destroy only organic matter.

88
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,193
Prisoners Brennick and Gomez,
get off here, please.

89
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,393
Up these stairs, please.

90
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,030
Come with me, please.

91
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,269
No fucking way!
We're not taking any more in here!

92
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,035
- We've got a crowd in here now.
- Complaining is a violation.

93
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,194
- So is overcrowding.
- Intestination starts in 5 seconds.

94
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,749
No, come on.

95
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,277
All right, big mama, come on.

96
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,356
The more the merrier.

97
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,829
Bitch.

98
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,790
- 5 seconds to enter cell.
- Come on in.

99
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,399
- What happens if you walk out?
- Try it.

100
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,393
What's your problem?

101
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,952
Laser perimeter intrusion.
Step back, please.

102
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,590
Smart fish. Very smart.

103
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,591
- You'll have to pay the rent.
- I do my own time.

104
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,469
There's all kinds of time.
Think about it.

105
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,315
You don't pay the rent,
me and Maddox come and get it.

106
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,119
Is that you?

107
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,870
No. Maddox is hard to miss. He's got
a 187 tattooed on his forehead.

108
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,357
Do you know what 187 means, fish?

109
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,594
I bet it's not your I.Q.

110
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,474
187. Murder statute.
He's doing the big bitch.

111
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,950
So maybe you want to pay the rent
after all.

112
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,397
60 seconds to lights out.

113
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,757
Brennick, John.

114
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,278
D-Day.

115
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,228
Anywhere you like, man.

116
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,996
Hey, pretty boy,
is your ass as sweet as your face?

117
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,951
- If it is, you can bunk with me.
- Try it and you're dead.

118
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,833
I can wait.

119
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,435
Night-night, sweetie.

120
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,793
Don't dream.

121
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,389
You're enjoying this.

122
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,793
- Yes, I suppose I am.
- Your function is to monitor.

123
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,670
We do not observe
for personal pleasure.

124
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,032
You don't understand pleasure ...

125
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,028
... or pain. I do.

126
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,835
- It is time for pain.
- I'm afraid it is.

127
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,994
Unauthorized thought process.

128
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,915
What's the matter?
Stomach ache? Indigestion maybe?

129
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,876
What's with him?

130
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,512
He's a ghost.
He got himself mind-wiped.

131
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,754
- He tried to escape. Big mistake.
- A mistake is what you make it.

132
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,595
Nobody makes it out of this place.

133
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,435
Don't belleve
everything they tell you.

134
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,229
Help!

135
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,751
Leave me alone! Help!

136
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,397
Private party.

137
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,673
Violence will not be tolerated.

138
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,069
Prisoners
Maddox, Brennick and Gomez.

139
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,189
You will be released from solitary
when the perpetrator is revealed.

140
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,148
I can't stand here any more.

141
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,717
- I've got to get out of here.
- Then fry, you little fuck!

142
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,792
Come on, you can do it.

143
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,913
Are you ready
to identify the perpetrator?

144
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,399
- I've got to get out of here.
- Think about being strong.

145
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,120
I am.

146
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,158
- Tell them ... you're dead.
- Shut your mouth.

147
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,073
I'll shut yours ... permanently.

148
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,994
915764, are you ready
to identify the perpetrator?

149
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,039
No ...

150
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,119
Who started the incident?

151
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,151
It was ...

152
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,629
It was ...

153
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,677
- Who started the incident?
- I did it.

154
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,400
It was me.

155
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,029
Prisoner Brennick,
report to Director Poe immediately.

156
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,589
Sit down, 95763.

157
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,430
- My name is Brennick.
- Of course it is.

158
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,116
- Make yourself comfortable.
- I am comfortable.

159
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,397
You're acquainted with Abraham.

160
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,872
He is the very best of our trustees.

161
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,397
I have written some excellent parole
reports, but in all honesty, -

162
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,758
- I don't know what I wouId do
if he were to leave us.

163
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,515
John Brennick ...

164
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,595
The most decorated captain
in the history of the black beret.

165
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,799
Yet you quit in disgrace,
didn't you?

166
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,069
- You lost an entire platoon.
- That's no business of yours!

167
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,155
So touchy.
I suppose that's understandable.

168
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,788
But still ...

169
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,670
WouId you want to lose
this particular former soldier?

170
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,033
We caught her before she reached
the far side of the bridge.

171
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,115
The law is clear:
One chlld per woman.

172
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,068
We live on a very small
and fragile planet.

173
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,789
We must maintain
the population balance.

174
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,592
Abortion is illegal and that
leaves only one alternative.

175
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,070
She is so beautiful.

176
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,756
- Intestinate, Karen Brennick.
- lntestination commencing.

177
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,833
- You bastard!
- ZED ...

178
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,590
I don't think you reallse
your predicament, Brennick.

179
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,237
You have nothing.
You have nowhere to hide.

180
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,756
You are nothing.

181
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,871
I fucked up.
I couIdn't handle it, man.

182
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,830
I know.
You better watch yourself.

183
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,950
Where's the women's section?

184
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,592
- Don't even think about it.
- Are you gonna report me?

185
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,230
His little sisters will do that.

186
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,398
- Where's the women's section?
- I am not going to die inside.

187
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,553
You'll die right here
if you don't tell me.

188
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,075
Ain't that a bitch.

189
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,633
Two fucking days and you're
just like everybody else in here.

190
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,430
- You didn't answer my question.
- Fuck you.

191
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,715
LeveIs A and B.

192
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,196
What is it?

193
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,195
The baby's kicking.
I can feel it kicking.

194
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,955
It's fine. It's natural.

195
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,831
I just want to hoId my baby
for a little while.

196
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,037
I know I can't keep her, -

197
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,320
- but just to see her
open her eyes ...

198
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,311
I won't let them take my baby.

199
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,399
Remove number 74270.

200
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,552
No ...

201
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,638
Get her!

202
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,633
Stop her!

203
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,116
Into the operating room.

204
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,748
Come on, take it easy.

205
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,790
Your babies are the property
of the Men-Tel Corporation.

206
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,518
Rise and fucking shine, asshole!

207
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,953
Laser perimeter intrusion.
Step back, please.

208
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,716
- Shall l intestinate?
- No.

209
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,998
Retract the bridge.

210
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,833
42910 is no longer any use.

211
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,869
l have a death warrant in his name.
Execute it, 95763.

212
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,076
That is an order!

213
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,757
Your sentimentality is touching,
but quite foollsh, Brennick.

214
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,391
Prisoners, a demonstration.

215
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,271
Let 'em go! Now!

216
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,357
You fucking asshole!

217
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,235
HoId your fire, ZED.
Intestinate, Brennick.

218
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,109
Random intestination.

219
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,554
Come on, Karen!

220
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,912
Take John Brennick to isolation
to await punishment.

221
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,709
Disobedience will not be tolerated.

222
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,955
- I owe you an apology.
- Not necessary.

223
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,793
Niàno ...

224
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,157
Come on, man. Let's go.

225
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,357
Shit, man!

226
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,592
Black beauties!

227
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,674
- This is Brennick's bed now.
- Since when?

228
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,037
Since your friend
got blasted by the splatter gun.

229
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,839
Dickhead!

230
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,995
- You look awful.
- That bad?

231
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,593
Worse.

232
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,548
I was clumsy.
I ran into a brick wall.

233
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,837
Only the wall was moving.

234
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,276
- Poe wants you to cooperate.
- So he told me.

235
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,796
He says I should tell you
it's gonna be very bad if you don't.

236
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,951
No kidding.

237
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,159
He says if I care about you at all
I would beg you to listen.

238
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,997
- What do you say?
- I want my husband.

239
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,998
You got him.

240
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:04,389
John, no matter what you do ...
I'll never not love you.

241
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,076
You're real lousy at goodbyes,
you know that?

242
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,357
I always have been.

243
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,790
Commence procedure.

244
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,434
John, help me!

245
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,236
He's been in there for three days.

246
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,552
No one has ever lasted four.

247
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,236
There's a first time for everything.

248
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:20,195
- You could stop his pain.
- But there's a price.

249
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,473
I want you to live here.

250
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,798
To share my quarters
for the remainder of your stay.

251
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,350
- Why me?
- Why does music give me pIeasure?

252
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,592
I skipped music appreciation.

253
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,914
I'm ... looking for a companion.

254
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,835
I'm not very friendly
to anyone who tortures my husband.

255
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,998
Stop it!

256
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,312
Stop it!

257
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,752
Yes ...

258
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,990
- What?
- Yes! Bastard! Just let him go.

259
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,198
Release John Brennick.
Return him to his cell.

260
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,190
Mother of God!
What have they done to him?

261
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,389
He's a ghost.

262
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,634
- He's gone.
- Bullshit! He's breathing.

263
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,712
The mind is dead.

264
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,231
The body just don't know it yet.

265
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,159
- WeIcome home, baby.
- Shall l intestinate?

266
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,278
Just a moment longer, ZED.

267
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,070
This is a fascinating dream.

268
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,833
Quite instructive ...

269
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,790
... regarding
the prisoner's psychology.

270
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,437
The Brennick woman is causing you
to act in an unprofessional manner.

271
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,990
None of your business.

272
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,751
- Her presence is a violation.
- I make my own decisions, ZED!

273
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,873
Shall l intestinate?

274
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,476
Unauthorized thought process.

275
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,959
It's a very advanced model.

276
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:20,558
Yes, you were a computer technician
in the army.

277
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,190
I never got near anything
as powerfuI as ZED.

278
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,718
Of course not. No one has.
Don't touch her!

279
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,358
ZED, seal control.

280
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,957
If you ever lay a finger
on her keyboard, -

281
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,032
- or utter a single voice command, -

282
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,957
- you and your child will feel
a pain unknown in human history.

283
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,554
Don't touch him, asshole!

284
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,508
What the fuck does he care?
He did it to himself.

285
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,558
No, they did it!

286
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,474
And what are you gonna do about it?

287
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,631
Yeah, right.

288
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,837
- What are you?
- I am enhanced.

289
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,916
- You're not human.
- A monster? A freak?

290
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:39,308
The Men-TeI Corporation transformed
me into a more efficient being.

291
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,556
Once a month,
I absorb amino acids.

292
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,110
I waste neither food nor fueI.

293
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,435
When my kind are in the majority,
there will be no more worId hunger.

294
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,390
You don't sleep. You don't eat.
You can't make love, can you?

295
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,634
No, but I can love.

296
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,271
- Are there others like you?
- Not many as advanced, but yes.

297
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,637
I was one of Men-TeI's first babies.
It was very speciaI.

298
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,555
- You're what becomes of our babies?
- Of course.

299
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,432
I saw your wife, Cap.

300
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,831
I saw Karen.

301
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,910
She's getting Iarger.

302
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,914
You can tell she's pregnant now.

303
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,718
She felt the baby move.

304
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,270
Your baby.

305
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,512
No ...

306
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,150
You know I cannot.

307
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,232
I know.

308
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,190
But have you ever tried?

309
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,593
This is ... very speciaI.

310
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,354
I wonder why
I've never tried this before.

311
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,552
How do you feel?

312
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,834
Very happy.

313
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,429
Why aren't you in voice mode?

314
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,997
Proceed, Director Poe.

315
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,079
Come here, Johnny.

316
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,277
Come here, Johnny.

317
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,395
You don't have to be afraid.

318
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,558
John ...

319
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,952
I'm here, John.

320
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,037
- Karen, where are you?
- Right here.

321
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:07,237
I must be more moderate
in the future.

322
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,274
Good morning, cell block orange,
level F.

323
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,355
30 minutes
before reporting for work.

324
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,153
- Get Brennick up.
- I'm awake.

325
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,590
Holy Fuck! You're alive!

326
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,275
- How long was I out?
- Four months.

327
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,355
It's true, man. You were long gone.

328
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,832
I'm okay.

329
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,911
Wait! I've been in here that long?
Karen's getting near term.

330
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,358
- She's all right.
- Did you seen her?

331
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,758
Are you strong enough for the truth?

332
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,435
Karen moved into Poe's quarters.

333
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,639
That's why he didn't kill you.

334
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,393
- She saved herseIf.
- She's closer to the way out.

335
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,518
- You'll never get in there.
- You do.

336
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,593
That's my job.

337
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,231
I've got a parole to worry about.
I'm not going to jeopardize that -

338
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,188
- so you can play
some great-escape bullshit!

339
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,158
I'm not playing.

340
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,315
We need to talk.

341
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:13,791
- Talk's dangerous.
- That's right, it is.

342
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,111
I've been talking to your husband.

343
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,636
I'm John's cell mate.

344
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:27,718
- All this time ...
- He's been like a zombie.

345
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:33,716
There was nothing there ...
until today.

346
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,711
It worked?

347
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,077
It worked!

348
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:47,756
- Thank God!
- I don't know what you did.

349
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,948
But now he's pIanning an escape.
Nobody ever gets out of here.

350
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,989
He's a good man.
I don't want to see him die.

351
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,948
He won't die. Not if I help him.

352
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,036
I don't know how,
but this will get Karen out.

353
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,274
Let me see that.
I know about these things.

354
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,830
I'll have to take it apart, but ...

355
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,278
- Can you put it back together?
- Machines love me.

356
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,479
I can make it work.
It's what I did in the worId.

357
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,552
- Mechanic?
- No, explosives.

358
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,473
First Intercontinental Bank.

359
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,872
I blew that safe
like it was fucking butter!

360
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,353
My partners didn't appreciate
my work and turned my ass in.

361
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,514
- Why?
- Shit! I blew up the money.

362
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,870
Don't fuck it up.

363
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,031
New pods will be ready next month.

364
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,637
- We're still behind schedule.
- Problems with the bedrock.

365
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,792
Five new levels must be ready
by the end of the year.

366
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,269
Yes, I am aware of that.

367
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,953
Reset your clock, ZED.
All work hours are now 93 minutes.

368
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,351
Confirmed.

369
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:39,832
- What are you doing awake?
- I couldn't sleep.

370
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:45,515
For the sake of our baby,
you must get your rest.

371
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,273
This thing is amazing!
She's beautiful!

372
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,558
This thing is a working genius.
Look at this.

373
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,395
This is a series of micros.
That's your pain mode.

374
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,950
This is a macro. That kills you.

375
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:40,433
This little thing on top,
that's your nerve clip.

376
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,797
I need you to put it back together.

377
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,876
- I'm working on it.
- And get it out of me.

378
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:55,831
I may be able
to cause you to throw it up ...

379
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,313
... but this bitch
is highly sensitive.

380
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,395
We're talking TNT on PMS.

381
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:11,111
- could it kill me?
- Definite possibility.

382
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,558
- Find another way.
- Maybe there is no other way.

383
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:20,111
Wrong answer. Try again.

384
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,636
- If I get it ...
- When you get it.

385
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,396
When I get it,
I'm going with you, man.

386
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,032
I'm having fun. I'm enjoying myseIf.

387
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,513
You know how long it's been
since I had any fun?

388
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:46,597
- Going out won't be fun.
- No, but it'll be a trip.

389
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,474
Just take it to him.

390
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:57,112
Just? Fuck the dumb shit.
That is a pretty big ''just''.

391
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,990
I know it's dangerous,
but I'm asking you anyway.

392
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,870
Say I don't get mind-wiped.
What's going to happen to my parole?

393
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,194
There's no parole. You hold onto
that hope because you're a man.

394
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:18,310
You keep something inside of you,
but this is a chance to fight back.

395
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,395
Fight for who?
You? Your husband?

396
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,836
I've never begged before in my life.

397
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,913
Please, Abraham?

398
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,835
If you won't do this for me,
do this for my baby.

399
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,273
- I've got to get this back.
- What is it?

400
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,194
Have you never seen
a holographic lens before?

401
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:56,309
The Only problem is we need a laser
to make this thing work.

402
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,796
- We've got a laser.
- You stick your hand in there.

403
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,713
We need something to hold it.

404
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,908
Wait a minute. Take that.
We've got something.

405
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,909
I'll be goddamned!

406
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,429
Look ... this could be a way out.

407
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:31,957
- Hold it steady.
- Sorry, this thing's heating up.

408
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,878
This is the construction area.
We go in this heating pipe.

409
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:45,194
It feeds into this utility shaft
which goes all the way up ...

410
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,318
If we don't get that, we're dead.

411
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,837
Fuck the lens, I need my glasses.

412
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,232
Get it, man.

413
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,719
Laser perimeter intrusion.
Step back, please.

414
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:38,031
- Shit man, don't you hurt?
- Yeah.

415
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,159
- How's the lens?
- Fine. The motherfucker's fine.

416
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,959
You should see what you fools
look like through this thing.

417
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,352
I want you to divorce your husband.

418
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,674
- That's not part of our bargain.
- You will never see him again.

419
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:15,358
He's only a cog in the Fortress's
grand design. Let me show you.

420
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:23,080
His only reason for being has been
the expansion of our facllity.

421
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,077
Have you touched this?

422
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:38,155
I noticed there was some dust
on there. I cleaned it.

423
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:43,474
You fool! Do you know what
it will cost to repair this map?

424
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,916
- I beg your indulgence.
- This will affect your parole.

425
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,640
I'm sorry.

426
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,433
Divorce your husband.
Marry me.

427
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,798
I will request permission
from the Men-Tel Corporation -

428
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,988
- to raise the child as my own.

429
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:24,518
I'm telling you ...
I will not enhance your child.

430
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,550
Does this mean nothing?

431
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:35,276
And John?

432
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,393
I will set him free.

433
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:48,759
Karen has to tell the man yes or no
by tomorrow night.

434
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,674
Good. We go tomorrow morning.

435
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,276
Hey, time's up.

436
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,750
I think I've got it, man.
Check this out.

437
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,354
Right there. Now, look.

438
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,033
- It's a magnetic detonator.
- So?

439
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:18,354
Didn't you go to grade school?
Magnets. You move one ...

440
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:24,197
- You can pull it out of us?
- Yeah ... in theory.

441
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:29,275
But I might just give the cell
a coat of red paint.

442
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,989
- Let's find out.
- You mean right now?

443
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:36,118
- Have you got a better time?
- No ...

444
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,431
If you explode,
what happens to the rest of us.

445
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,194
Try me.

446
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:46,558
- I'm going with you.
- No way!

447
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:54,754
Are you gonna do it ... or what?

448
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,956
This might hurt a little bit, okay?

449
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,915
Where are you, man?

450
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,839
I think I've got it.

451
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,639
Quit fucking around,
you little asshole!

452
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,113
No hurry, no worry.

453
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:00,308
Stop fooling around.
Get the damn thing out of him!

454
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,837
I'm not fooling around. It's stuck.

455
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,555
It's okay.

456
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,919
Okay ... my turn.

457
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:36,234
Somebody take notes, man.
I can't do it to myseIf.

458
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,473
I'll do it to you ...
after you do it to me.

459
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:45,077
- What about your parole?
- Bullshit! It's time I woke up.

460
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,073
I'm going with you.

461
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,157
No, it's too much of a risk.

462
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:56,108
Are you afraid you'll lose us ...

463
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,637
... like you lost your platoon?

464
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:05,920
I don't ever want to be responsible
for another man's life again.

465
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,231
Hey man, I speak for myself.

466
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:14,758
But it's better to die trying
than to die in here.

467
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,317
Right on, man.

468
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,155
Fucking A.

469
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,274
I haven't dreamt in 40 years.

470
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:39,638
John Brennick is fully rehabilitated
and is hereby granted a full pardon.

471
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,797
He is free to leave the Fortress ...

472
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,112
Before completing this
there is something you should see.

473
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,397
Not now, ZED.

474
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,993
l insist.

475
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,999
- Well?
- Please observe.

476
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,273
How dare you spy on my quarters?

477
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:30,313
A report has been filed with
Men-Tel's board of directors.

478
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,472
You are releaved of your position.

479
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,871
Your replacement
will be here within 24 hours.

480
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,828
Until then,
you are confined to quarters.

481
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,670
Confined to quarters?

482
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,594
I've never left these quarters
in my entire life.

483
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,709
You are the property
of the Men-Tel Corporation.

484
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,633
I am the director.

485
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:06,157
You will please leave
central control.

486
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,232
Crime does not pay.

487
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:35,630
Construction area altercation.
Maddox, Brennick, Stiggs, Gomez.

488
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:41,750
- That's impossible.
- lntestination commencing.

489
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,595
No! Maddox is dead!

490
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,193
Come on!

491
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,230
They're escaping
and you will be responsible.

492
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:06,428
You will be lucky if you end up
a Speak-and-Spell.

493
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,592
Mass intestination.

494
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:21,555
They're in the pipe.
Open the steam valves.

495
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,392
Activate the strike clones.

496
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:43,110
- I thought this was the way out.
- It is the way out.

497
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,199
- We've got to get out of here.
- Move!

498
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:16,828
Surrender immediately
and you will not be harmed.

499
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,471
Brennick, I have your wife.

500
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,518
You have ten seconds to surrender.

501
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:29,834
- Don't do it.
- This is our only chance!

502
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,233
- If you go, you're dead.
- I'm not gonna be boiled alive.

503
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,836
- I'm coming out.
- No!

504
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,150
This way.

505
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,997
Come on, we're out of here.

506
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,997
ZED warned me our relationship
was not in the interest of Men-Tel.

507
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:30,358
I ignored her. Foollsh me.

508
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:38,514
- Get out of the way.
- Intestinate Abraham, please.

509
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,709
Get the fuck out of the way!

510
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,957
What the fuck is it?

511
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:17,593
This is incredible. They've wired
a person into the mainframe.

512
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,629
- The perfect soldier.
- Nerve-capable firing pins.

513
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,754
The shit they're coming up with
these days ...

514
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,915
Let's move.

515
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:55,840
Take cover!

516
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,795
Take cover!

517
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,839
- Activate second strike team.
- Accelerate reaction time.

518
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,831
This way.

519
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:54,318
- Splatter gun to construction area.
- Captain! I can't see, man!

520
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,472
I'm blind as a bat!

521
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,558
Captain! Where are you?

522
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:07,669
Is that you?
I can't see.

523
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,673
Where are you?

524
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,832
Niàno! Let's go. Come on.

525
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:35,035
- Shoot them, ZED.
- Cannot lock on target.

526
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,510
Come on, bitch.

527
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:42,434
- Peekaboo.
- Get that gun out of there.

528
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,358
- Get me out of here.
- We're taking the express, come on.

529
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,273
Niàno!

530
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:41,148
- Where are they, ZED?
- No visual recognition.

531
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,558
Move!

532
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,950
Brennick ...

533
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:30,398
You're going to pay, you bastard.
Karen!

534
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,519
- Where is she?
- You want to see your wife?

535
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,156
Operating room A.

536
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:55,198
You see, in this operation
only the child survives.

537
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:00,195
Release me ... or she dies.

538
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,716
Tell them to stop.

539
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,714
Now!

540
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:20,309
ZED, cease delivery.

541
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,917
l'm sorry,
l do not recognize the command.

542
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:29,999
ZED ... please.

543
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:35,314
Men-Tel will not negotiate
during a hostage situation.

544
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:39,393
We're going to the operating room.
Come on!

545
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:45,315
l cannot allow you
to put the Fortress in jeopardy.

546
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,118
What's going on, man?

547
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:17,075
You're trapped here, Brennick.
The strike clones are on their way.

548
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,357
There is no escape.

549
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,112
Get me to the computer keyboard.

550
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:29,876
Big mama's running this show.
She's the one we've got to fuck up.

551
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,798
Okay ...

552
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,317
All right ... Here goes nothing.

553
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:52,157
A feedback virus.

554
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,634
Incapacitated.

555
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,159
Okay ...

556
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,155
Holy Mary, mother of God!

557
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:22,193
We've got to move out. I'll meet you
in transport, the way we came in.

558
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:26,399
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

559
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,320
John!

560
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:54,395
- Karen!
- I'm in here, John!

561
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,911
I'm in here, John!

562
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,718
Let her go.

563
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,238
- It's dead.
- Move over.

564
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,949
Now the door.
We've got to open the door.

565
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:10,830
There's got to be
an emergency button, right?

566
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:52,749
- Jesus! My water's broken.
- She's having the baby. Pull over.

567
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:58,916
- Not until we cross the border.
- Baby, get back in there.

568
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:09,114
The contractions are coming closer.
We've got to stop.

569
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,556
There's something over there.

570
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:39,873
- I'm never going to have this baby.
- Yeah, right.

571
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:46,038
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna look for a blanket.

572
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,430
Brennick! Get out of there!

573
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,518
Crime does not pay.

574
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,550
Crime does not pay.

575
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,639
Karen!
