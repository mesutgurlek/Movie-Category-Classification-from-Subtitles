Some people say the mother war was
invented when the French built this zoo

473
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:27,191
10 million gallons pump
through everywhere out

474
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:30,528
A mile that no one ever see

Lee, you know this guy?

00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:44,542
He doesn't talk about him much

00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:47,579
ln fact, he's spend his whole
life trying to forget me

483
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,315
How with it look if
Hong Kong lnspector Lee

485
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:55,587
You're not my brother anymore

486
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:57,722
Are you forgetting about Chenzhou?

487
00:37:57,722 --> 00:37:59,157
Yes, i forgot

488

You spared my life in Los Angeles

489
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,064
You should have shot me in that alley.
But you didn't pull the trigger.

490
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:08,862
because you can't escape your past.

491
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,003
l didn't kill you because
l'm not an assasin.

492
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:14,733
Let me rebuild the favor, Lee

493
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:16,874

494

we have to get out of here, now!

654
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:25,822
You see it?

655
00:57:25,822 --> 00:57:27,724
We got get out of here, damn!

656
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:28,759
Lee, damn you!

657
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:30,784
Next time, l'll get my own damn room!

658
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:35,721
This people are danger

659
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:41,071
That is something you should know

660
00:57:41,071 --> 00:57:42,873
l'm not what you think l am!

661
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:46,741
Are you telling me, you gay?

662
00:57:50,614 --> 00:57:54,684
l'm try to tell you, l'm American spy

663
00:57:54,684 --> 00:57:56,186
You're spy?

664
00:57:56,186 --> 00:57:58,154
Yeah, something work on police

665
00:57:59,756 --> 00:58:02,384
Shut your mouth, George, nothing well

666
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:09,758
Can't talk about it!

667
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,935
From this moment all!

668
00:58:11,935 --> 00:58:14,597
Don't ever ask me, that my business!

669
00:58:15,672 --> 00:58:17,107
Come with me!

670
00:58:17,107 --> 00:58:19,302
Now!

671
00:58:24,314 --> 00:58:25,849
We need to get out of the city

672
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:27,617
We not going anywhere,
do you tell us exactly...

673
00:58:27,617 --> 00:58:28,982
what's going on?

674
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:33,857
We cannot help you,
until you tell us the truth

675
00:58:33,857 --> 00:58:35,984
Where is Shaxing?

676
00:58:37,928 --> 00:58:39,953
ls right here!

677
00:58:40,664 --> 00:58:42,222
Holly mother Jesus!

678
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:48,872
l broke my car!

679
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:51,241
l'm not the man, you just the vega

680
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:52,709
You sure about that?

681
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:55,178
Lee, got to check

682
00:58:55,178 --> 00:58:56,475
lf she got anything in her back

683
00:58:58,715 --> 00:59:01,184
l'm a women, James,
a women who need to way out...

684
00:59:01,184 --> 00:59:03,553
You have Shaxing?

685
00:59:03,553 --> 00:59:05,322
No!

686
00:59:05,322 --> 00:59:07,290
l'm Shaxing!

687
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:18,232
ln the ancient time,
when they try select new leader

688
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:21,738
They were secret into a women

689
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:27,699
A women, who can terrist a list
of Shaxing, to the 35 border of China

690
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:31,848
When the journey end it,
and the new leader we found...

691
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:35,385
the women would be head it,
and very forever

692
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:37,387
No records, no witness

693
00:59:37,387 --> 00:59:39,389
What take the traditional is that?

694
00:59:39,389 --> 00:59:41,458
Have these guys never heard
of a goddamn fax machine?

695
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:44,294
Kenji and me do it.
He said it was a great honor.

696
00:59:44,294 --> 00:59:46,062
l wanted to do it for him.

697
00:59:46,062 --> 00:59:47,464
For some brotherhood.

698
00:59:47,464 --> 00:59:49,132
Then why did you send their names
to Hunt?

699
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:51,601
Because l thought the wrong code
could protect me.

700
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:53,136
But now l see.

701
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:54,571
Nobody can.

702
00:59:54,571 --> 00:59:56,873
You're mess up in some weird shit, lady.

703
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:58,775
l mean, man, whatever the hell you are.

704
00:59:58,775 --> 01:00:00,143
l'm a woman.

705
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:03,380
And they will send an army to kill me.
To protect their way.

706
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,916
You know what?
We can't fight no army, Lee.

707
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:08,384
Who can protect me? l mean us.

708
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:11,078
l know a place.

709
01:00:19,796 --> 01:00:22,365
l won't be here when you come out.
l'm sorry.

710
01:00:22,365 --> 01:00:24,467
My wife says l can't be a spy.

711
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:26,102
And l have to be home for dinner.

712
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:29,172
Truth is l'm a driver. Nothing more.

713
01:00:29,172 --> 01:00:31,675
This is my destiny.

714
01:00:31,675 --> 01:00:34,110
l will never know what it's like
to be an American.

715
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:37,079
Never know what it feels like
to kill for no reason.

716
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,616
George, it's okay.

717
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:41,384
Thank you.

718
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:43,944
And good luck.

719
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:59,867
What happened?

720
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:04,107
That list. This is incredible.

721
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:05,942
Some people said it was a myth.

722
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:10,174
No, it's no myth. l've seen it.
Kiss it. But l didn't french kiss it.

723
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,382
You do understand how dangerous this is.

724
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:14,017
l could always use some protection.

725
01:01:14,017 --> 01:01:15,352
Can we go to the police?

726
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:18,455
l tried talk to many of them.

727
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:20,446
We have to go through out of the country.

728
01:01:21,624 --> 01:01:23,126
Now my dear.

729
01:01:23,126 --> 01:01:25,428
Would you mind taking off that wig.

730
01:01:25,428 --> 01:01:27,364
Showing us Shosha.

731
01:01:27,364 --> 01:01:29,161
We never told him she was the list.

732
01:01:34,637 --> 01:01:36,539
Look at that.

733
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:40,343
13 names of things
to centres of tradition.

734
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:43,574
The only real proof
that the secret world exists.

735
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:55,047
Take their guns.

736
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,603
l told you he was bad, didn't l tell you?

737
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:10,240
While l was thinking it,
the explosion at the embassy.

738
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,941
As head of the world criminal court,

739
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:14,044
it would make sense for me
to be a target.

740
01:02:14,044 --> 01:02:16,012
Why did you come to my room?

741
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:17,914
Geneviere was going to be killed.

742
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:21,351
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.

743
01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:25,219
Now, it will end another value.

744
01:02:26,222 --> 01:02:27,957
lt's over, Reynard.

745
01:02:27,957 --> 01:02:30,260
You know what it's like
to be an old man in prison?

746
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,594
They call you pops.

747
01:02:31,594 --> 01:02:33,363
They make you work in the library.

748
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:36,059
Your best friend,
gonna be a mouse.

749
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:40,737
l'm not falling into prison.

750
01:02:40,737 --> 01:02:43,297
You have a phonecall, inspector.

751
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:51,314
Hello, brother.

752
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:53,416
l'd like to make a trade.

753
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:56,619
Some friends of mine came across
something in the Los Angeles.

754
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:59,520
Something very valuable.

755
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,392
Lee.

756
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:04,360
Help me please.

757
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,965
Do we understand each other?

758
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:09,966
What do you want?

759
01:03:09,966 --> 01:03:12,068
Shashon.

760
01:03:12,068 --> 01:03:15,003
You and Geneviere
will make me a long pride.

761
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:17,574
lf l see you're with any other cops,

762
01:03:17,574 --> 01:03:19,375
the girl dies.

763
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,244
Where?

764
01:03:21,244 --> 01:03:23,179
Jules Vaugh Restaurant.

765
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:24,578
Midnight.

766
01:03:25,548 --> 01:03:27,243
Don't be late.

767
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:02,947
He brought the girl.
Send the elevator down.

768
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:38,313
Welcome to the party, Lee.

769
01:04:39,789 --> 01:04:42,358
Tonight we celebrate the return
of Shashon...

770
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:45,361
and the return of my brother.

771
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:47,795
Where is Soo Yung.

772
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:05,782
This sword has a past.

773
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:09,582
Unlike our world, it has seen
much pain, much blood.

774
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:16,726
Hundreds of years ago, the Triads will
kill their enemies...

775
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:19,262
with 100 cuts to the body.

776
01:05:19,262 --> 01:05:23,289
They would be very careful to avoid
any major arteries...

777
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:27,503
so that the victim would stay alive
for as long as possible.

778
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:30,961
You have just experience
to your first cut.

779
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:35,276
lf anything happens to Soo Yung...

780
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:38,348
You can never kill me, Lee.

781
01:05:38,348 --> 01:05:39,882
We both know that.

782
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:41,784
You know nothing about me.

783
01:05:41,784 --> 01:05:45,686
l know you have no wife.
No children. No family.

784
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:50,650
You life ended when you were a kid
back in Chenjo.

785
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:59,458
You have nothing... just like me.

786
01:05:59,636 --> 01:06:02,935
l won't say nothing.

787
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:08,139
He has me.

788
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:11,242
His brother from another mother.

789
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:18,419
Where is she?

790
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:20,782
And join the few.

791
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,720
Soo Yung.

792
01:06:28,498 --> 01:06:30,693
Help me.

793
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:33,536
Let her go.

794
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:35,305
What the hell is wrong with you?

795
01:06:35,305 --> 01:06:37,006
Do you wanna die, Kenji?

796
01:06:37,006 --> 01:06:38,906
Get her outtajere

797
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:41,277
Carter, drop the gun

798
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:43,713
Get off that damn robber,
you end that temptations

799
01:06:43,713 --> 01:06:46,375
Rite now!

800
01:06:52,288 --> 01:06:55,348
Put her down, i'm serious

801
01:06:56,826 --> 01:06:58,851
l'm not playing

802
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,032
Kenji
-Drop the gun. -No!

803
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:05,432
Drop it, Carter!

804
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:08,965
Shit

805
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:25,179
Get off of me!

806
01:07:26,923 --> 01:07:29,221
l'm gonna kick his ass, Kenji

807
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,348
He might be your brother,
but turn out to your sister

808
01:08:45,435 --> 01:08:47,699
Hold on, i'm coming!

809
01:09:14,897 --> 01:09:16,888
Lee!

810
01:10:46,289 --> 01:10:48,120
Enough, Kenji!

811
01:11:23,726 --> 01:11:26,194
Everybody comes for party

812
01:11:44,313 --> 01:11:47,111
What are you waiting for? do it!

813
01:11:59,929 --> 01:12:05,162
We're both gonna die
-No, l can save you

814
01:12:14,844 --> 01:12:17,540
Good bye, Lee
-No, Kenji

815
01:12:21,684 --> 01:12:23,675
No!

816
01:12:53,315 --> 01:12:55,112
l'm coming to you!

817
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:02,081
