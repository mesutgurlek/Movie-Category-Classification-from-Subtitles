1
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,320
They call me Ford Fairlane,
rock 'n'roll detective.

2
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,880
I have the power
to get into the hottest clubs,...

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,320
..the hottest dressing rooms
and the hottest chicks.

4
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,760
I admit it all sounds pretty nifty in theory.
Then why am I here?

5
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,360
Why do I wish the music industry and the rest
of the globe would just suck my dick, Tracy?

6
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,760
I'll tell you why. It all startedfive nights ago.

7
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,840
I didn't know it yet, but I was about
to get a case of the Black Plague.

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,720
Not the disease that killed
a billion peasants in the 1300s.

9
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Something much scarier.

10
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
("Rock 'n'Roll Junkie")

11
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,400
Hello, LA!

12
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,480
You see, this band, The Black Plague,
were considered the new kings of metal.

13
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,720
I thought they were just
some lucky assholes from Reseda.

14
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,960
Anyway, tonight, this guy Bobby Black was
going to give the performance of his life.

15
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,520
I love you, Bobby!

16
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,720
I guess the poor superstar son of a bitch
wasn't that lucky after all, hey?

17
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,840
In the meantime, I was miles away,...

18
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,560
..checking out a tip on the case
of the fanatic red-headedfan.

19
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,280
And making my entrance was unbelievable.

20
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,720
- (all gasp)
- Whoa! Was my fly undone?

21
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,120
I'm so terrifical I even had my own
toll-free number. 1-800-UNBELIEVABLE.

22
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,800
Ford. I gotta ask you to put that out, dude.

23
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,160
Nobody smokes any more.

24
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Thanks, man.

25
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,440
- You son of a bitch.
- Another satisfied customer.

26
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Call me.

27
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,200
What goes for my sister goes double for me.

28
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,560
Don'tyou remember? The Jacuzzi, Laurel
Canyon - Guns N' Roses video wrap party?

29
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,200
Oh, yeah. The twins.
Butyou're not... identical, huh?

30
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,000
Hey, look. Write down my number.

31
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,680
- 555-6321. Got it?
- Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

32
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,200
Wait a minute. 555's not a real number.

33
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
They only use that in the movies.

34
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,560
No shit, honey.
What do you thinkthis is? Real life?

35
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,680
- Hey, it's Ford Fairlane.
- Easy money.

36
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,360
(both) Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective.

37
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,600
Couldn't find a handle on a coffee cup.

38
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,560
And what are your names?
Neil and Bob? Or is that, like, whatyou do?

39
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,000
- You guys driving tonight?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,600
Why don'tyou take Mulholland?
You'll love the curves. Now move.

41
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,960
Thank Godfor Don Cleveland.
He was the best producer in the biz,...

42
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,560
..the only guy in the industry
I could talk to withoutvomiting Day-Glo.

43
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Ah. I hate that "Mr Rock 'n' Roll
Detective" bullshit, you know?

44
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
I'm a professional crime-fighter.

45
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,000
- I work for a living, you knowthat.
- (Don) What are you looking at?

46
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,520
Some redhead's bothering
that girl group, The Pussycats.

47
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,200
Been showing up at their concerts, saying he
wants to rape and kill 'em. Not in that order.

48
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,400
Hey, you're that guy. The private eye.

49
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,760
You're a poet and didn't know it. Oh!

50
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
- You heard that Bobby Black OD'd, right?
- Yeah. So?

51
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,200
So, do you suspect foul play and stuff?

52
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,560
I'll letyou know when somebody
pays me to give a shit and stuff.

53
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,920
My name is Melodi.

54
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,000
As in "A pretty girl is like a..."
Here's my phone number.

55
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,200
Whatever you're doing tomorrow...

56
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,360
Cancel. OK?

57
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,280
You got to shave before you
leave the house in a dress like that.

58
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,520
And I don't mean your legs.

59
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,040
Boy, whatyou gonna do?

60
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,080
Hey. You'd better have
that sambuca milkshake ready.

61
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Here comes Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective.

62
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,080
- Hey, Ford.
- What's goin' on?

63
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Harry. Shake me.

64
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,640
I hope you like it, Ford.

65
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,160
Precocious. Combustionable.

66
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,120
Harry... not thick enough.
Butyou're getting better.

67
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,760
- So how's Mutt and Mutt, huh?
- Hoo! Hoo!

68
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,320
- Who's your friend?
- Sh.

69
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm just some guy named Sam, asswipe.

70
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,120
Sam. How cute.

71
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,880
Reminds me of that story,
Green Eggs and Ham.

72
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,840
"Will you eat them in a box?
Will you eat them with a fox?"

73
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,720
Know The Pussycats? Big Doctor Seuss fans.

74
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,400
- (nervous laugh)
- Especially the singer. What's her name?

75
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,040
- I'm drawin' a fuckin' blank.
- (stammers) Josie.

76
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,000
Boy. Wonder if this could be our guy.

77
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,240
Deceitful bitches.

78
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Last dance,...

79
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,480
..Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective.

80
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,880
You're ten seconds away from
the most embarrassing moment of your life.

81
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,800
Something from our wine list?

82
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,320
Come on, Ford. This shit's gettin' old, man.

83
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,560
- (screams)
- Excuse me a moment.

84
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,480
So many assholes.

85
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,080
So few bullets.

86
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,400
Clint Eastwood?

87
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,880
I fucked him. Oh!

88
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
(gentle snoring)

89
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
("Purple Haze" by Jimi Hendrix)

90
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,320
Purple Haze all in my brain

91
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,640
Lately things just don't seem the same

92
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,960
Actin'funny, but I don't know why

93
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Do my dishes!

94
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
As if my alarm clock wasn't enough,...

95
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,840
..it was time for my late afternoon
wake-up callfrom Jazz.

96
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,960
- Jazz was my assistant.
- (music stops)

97
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,960
Oh, thank God.

98
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,480
- Hello?
- Ford. Do you know what time it is?

99
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,680
And the only woman I treat with sensitivity.

100
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,360
Wonk, wonk. You sound like
Charlie Brown's friggin' teacher.

101
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,840
Why am I late? I was up all night
eatin' Swedish meatballs. Oh!

102
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,320
- I was doin' my job.
- That's a first.

103
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,640
- All right. I'll be in later.
- OK. Don't hang up, because...

104
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,120
- Where are my shoes?
- Hey, girls, what do you need over there?

105
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
- Come on.
- Ford, we just needed to be held.

106
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
You got the bonus plan.

107
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
("Purple Haze" by Jimi Hendrix)

108
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,080
Hey. Wait. Stop.

109
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
I'm coming. Hey.

110
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,000
Ow! What's goin' on, kid?

111
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,280
Hey, Fairlane. You gonna find out who
killed the lead singer of The Black Plague?

112
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,160
Tell me, Dr Watson. What makes you so sure
he's just not another piece-of-shit overdose?

113
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,320
- Gut feeling.
- Gut feeling, huh?

114
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,000
See those chicks?
Girl Scouts. Tooktwo boxes.

115
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,280
Hey. Get that outta your mouth!
Don'tyou knowthose things are killers?

116
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,120
Don'tyou go to school, or listen to Smokey
the Bear and all that kind of shit, huh?

117
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
(gasping)

118
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
You sick son of a bitch.

119
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
Have a Twinkie, snapper-head.

120
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,120
I can't breathe in here, Fairlane.

121
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,320
When are you gonna let me work with you?
Why are you always fuckin' with me?

122
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,440
Excuse me! You say the f-word again,
I'll bang you right the fuck out.

123
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,360
Do you understand me?
Now get the fuck outta here.

124
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,840
(muffled banging)

125
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,840
I've got something serious to discuss.

126
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,240
Yeah, what is it? Premature ejaculation? Ha!

127
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,240
You know, Ford,
sometimes you can be a real dick.

128
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,080
"Dick", "fuck"... What kinda kid are you?

129
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
(muffled) Fairlane...

130
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,720
My office was at the Crossroads of the World.

131
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,120
The rent was high,
but it was worth it for those chicks.

132
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Those big, fat chicks.

133
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,680
They say all the time,
you know I love your stuff

134
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,840
But no matter what,
they just can't get enough

135
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,320
- Hey, my man Slam.
- Yo. What's happenin'? Cool coat.

136
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,560
Why don'tyou take it across the street to the
7-Eleven? I'm poppin' a fuckin' brain vessel.

137
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,680
If your big gulp-head producer clients
would dare to show a little brains,...

138
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,680
..they would sign my ass up on
that tour and I'd be touring the world.

139
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,400
1990 would be a most glorious year,
you know what I'm sayin'?

140
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,160
Hey, look. I'm only bullshittin'. You know
I dig the new stuff. It's fuckin' phenomenal.

141
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,360
Some people are claustrophobic,
Fairlane. I'm allergic too.

142
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,080
So don't make it out like
I'm some kind of weirdo.

143
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,840
- You can't prove shit.
- Shut up.

144
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,960
Good morning.
She said, as the clock struck five.

145
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,800
Josie was hungry, so I sent The Pussycats
for food. They've been waiting.

146
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,680
They're only a double-platinum band.
They have nothing better to do, right?

147
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,360
Silence, Jazz. That tip paid off.

148
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,480
This is Sam the Sleazebag.
Sam the Sleazebag, Jazz.

149
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,680
- My assistant.
- Hey, Ford. A little late, huh?

150
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,280
I love you all.

151
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,400
That's him. That's the bastard
who flashed us at the Amphitheatre.

152
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,680
- You bitches have no proof.
- Shut up.

153
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,560
I think I could identify it.
It looked like a dick, only smaller.

154
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,200
All right, Sam. We're gonna letyou go, OK?

155
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,040
- We just gotta keep the evidence.
- (all) What?

156
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
(bell rings)

157
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,200
Now... you pay.

158
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,960
- It's called citizen's castration.
- Argh!

159
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
Next time, it'll be for real.

160
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,480
- Argh! Argh!
- (crash)

161
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,640
You stupid Sal's-Pizza-
garlic-breath-smelling motherfucker.

162
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,040
Today is the last day of the rest of your life.

163
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,880
Take this, Ford,
as payment for a job well done.

164
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,080
It's solid gold. It'll make sure
you're not late for other clients.

165
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,520
- No, money's fine, really.
- Bye, Ford.

166
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,120
- You're our hero.
- You're the greatest.

167
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
(mimicking) "Bye, Ford."

168
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,320
Let me cheer you up, Ford.
I've got the INXS payment.

169
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
There you go. G'day!

170
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,640
- They say it's worth three grand.
- (koala chatters)

171
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,400
Fuckin' Australians. I hate that country.
Continent, whatever the hell it is.

172
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,120
Don't we do nuclear testing there?
What is that? Some kind of giant mouse?

173
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,520
Down. Down and eat.

174
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,640
Milli Vanilli paid us off
in bicycle shorts and hair extensions.

175
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Very scary.

176
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,240
Rock stars. I'm goin' out
of my mind dealin' with rock stars.

177
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,400
I don't make money, I make gifts.

178
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,080
How am I supposed to pay taxes
with bathtub compact disc players...

179
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,280
..and autographed drumsticks, you know?

180
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,200
I need cash, moolah, wampum. Dead
presidents, Michael Jackson, Gerald Ford.

181
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,880
I think it's coming together. You need money.

182
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,760
Come on, Jazz. I got my balls in a bunch.

183
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Your karate class costs money. Cavities
cost money. Propa-pylactics cost money.

184
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,000
Know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna take
that food processor Neil Diamond gave me...

185
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,680
..and make koala burgers,
with koala chips and koala dip.

186
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,240
- That's what I think.
- You're breaking my heart, Ford.

187
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,200
Look. I thinkthat we've got a case.

188
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,000
If we can make it through
this cavalcade of bimbos.

189
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,520
Hi, Ford. It's Monica. Remember me?

190
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,200
I'm walking again. Call me.

191
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,880
- That's Bimbo No.1.
- Hey, cut the play-by-play, all right?

192
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,920
Hi. Is this Chevy Nova?
Is this the car I want to speak to?

193
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,360
Johnny Crunch here, KDRT.
You know- K-DIRT, you schmuck?

194
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,600
You know, I'm the guy who had sex with your
prom date the very night before the prom.

195
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,840
And then I became the hottest DJ in the west.

196
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,480
Well, I got a case for you.
I don't wantyou to come here and say...

197
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,960
.."Is it a leather case or a vinyl case?"

198
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,560
No. It's a case to solve. Come down
to the station about six. Make it six.

199
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,280
Johnny Teitelbaum, calling himself
Johnny Crunch. Knock me out, huh?

200
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,120
You know, we grew up together in Brooklyn.
Came out here to become rock stars.

201
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,080
He's lying about the prom-date thing,
of course. I hope he is. I took his sister.

202
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,120
You're friends with the most
obnoxious asshole on the airwaves?

203
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,680
The king of the shock jocks?

204
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,080
- I'm shocked.
- Don't worry about it.

205
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,000
He wants to see me at six. What time is it?

206
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,840
- Take this. I think you might need it.
- (phone rings)

207
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,480
- Hit pay dirt with K-DIRT.
- (modem tone)

208
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:17,080
That's for me. Radio contests?
Really, Ford. Howtacky.

209
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,600
So, what are you gonna do about this watch?

210
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,960
Keep it. It's your paycheckthis month.

211
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,440
That's nice. What about last month?

212
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Come here. Come here.

213
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,840
Come here.
I wanna tell you something. Come here.

214
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,400
Huh? Huh?

215
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Unbelievable.

216
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,720
When Johnny and I broke up our band,
we drifted apart.

217
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,960
He started hanging out with all those rock
star hairhead types, like the late Bobby Black.

218
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,080
And when they needed money to get high,
they did RockAgainst Drugs commercials.

219
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,440
You see what I'm sayin'?
That's what I'm sayin'. What am I sayin'?

220
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't know.

221
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,120
Hey, Pixie. I'm here to see Johnny Crunch.

222
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
Lucky you. Arnie.

223
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,120
Mr Crunch has a lot of fans
who hate his guts.

224
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,280
Oh, Arnie. Sometimes when we touch
the honesty's too much.

225
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Sorry.

226
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,120
It's Johnny Crunch here.

227
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,520
As always, if we call you and you answer the
phone by saying "Hit pay dirt with K-DIRT",...

228
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
..you could win a cool million.

229
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,440
At K-DIRT, we play
the kind of music your mother hates.

230
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,560
I know, because right now, she's naked
under the desk swallowing my microphone.

231
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,920
She likes that. Oops. I broke it accidentally.

232
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,160
Seriously, I make jokes aboutyour mothers,...

233
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,600
..but I knowthey're just pathetic sluts
who have no lives and have sex with midgets.

234
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,280
(rock)

235
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,640
Johnny Teitelbaum. Gettin' paid
to be the asshole you always were, huh?

236
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,360
Suzuki Samurai.

237
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,440
You Bensonhurst piece of shit.

238
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,640
Here we are, still in Los Angeles,
two rock 'n' roll dicks.

239
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,960
Only you're the detective
and I'm just a regular dick.

240
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,280
It was nice hearin' from you
after you hit it big, you rat.

241
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,440
I guess your arms were amputated
and you couldn't pick up a phone.

242
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,920
But this is not a social call.
Here, take a look at that.

243
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,960
Yeah. Real nice. So?

244
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,640
She's my daughter.

245
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,280
She calls herself Zuzu Petals.

246
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,000
It's the sickest thing.
You see, years ago, I was in Jersey.

247
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,360
I meet this girl.
She's a total pig, but I fucked her.

248
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,480
Yeah, I heard you started dating.

249
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,760
Well, she gets pregnant, she has the kid,
the kid grows up, moves out here.

250
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,240
And, you know, typical story. She's screwin'
with all the rock stars, takin' drugs.

251
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,320
And I lost track of her. And I want her back.

252
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,040
Cos she's my daughter, my pride and joy.

253
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,320
I don't take cases with foundations
in bullshit. They're hard to walk around in.

254
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,520
- OK. You found me out.
- Level with me, Johnny.

255
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,960
All right. She's my sister. She's my daughter.
She's my sister and my daughter.

256
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,080
Look at the picture
and find her and bring her backto me.

257
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:32,800
I've been told it might be hard to pay your
rent with gold records and koala bears. OK?

258
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,600
Maybe this'll make it
a little more attractive to you. $4,000.

259
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,560
- Zuzu Petals, huh?
- Zuzu Petals.

260
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,840
So I hope you... Nah, I know
you're gonna find her cos you're the best.

261
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Guys like you, you do grow on trees.

262
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,040
You're OK, Johnny. Here's to you...

263
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,920
(both) Sucking my dick.

264
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,600
Ah, let me get outta here.

265
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,960
No dessert until after you finish your dinner.

266
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,720
Money, money, money, money, money... Argh.

267
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,840
How hard could it be to nail down
one teenage blonde groupie in LA?

268
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,840
(Johnny) Any teenage virgins,
show up with a jar of petroleum jelly...

269
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,720
..right now,
and ask to speak to Johnny Crunch.

270
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,240
I never even liked the bastard.

271
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,440
2,000 private investigators in Los Angeles.

272
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,480
So why did I pickthe music industry? Well...

273
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
It made sense to specialise.

274
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
I coulda been anything.
I coulda been a fisherman.

275
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,080
Fishermen, they get up in the morning.

276
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,840
They fish. They sell fish. They smell fish.

277
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,960
Reminds me of this girl I used to go with,
Yvonne. She smelled like fish.

278
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,480
- (gunshot on radio)
- (Johnny) Someone shot my engineer. Hey.

279
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,240
Hey, let go of the mike. What are you... Hey.

280
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,680
Someone call the cops. Help me.

281
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,320
Please, let go of me. Let me go!

282
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,400
These LA drivers, man.
How do they get their licence?

283
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,480
(Johnny screams)

284
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
(horns blare)

285
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,520
I'm being electrocuted!
I'm being... Help me!

286
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,560
- It hurts! Argh!
- Call the cops. Johnny's being electrocuted.

287
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,160
- Oh, please. It's just one of his stupid jokes.
- Oh, fucking shit, my Christ!

288
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,160
Hey! He can't say "Oh, fucking shit,
my Christ" over the air.

289
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,040
- Hey, Arnie. Your fly.
- Please let go of me! That's hot!

290
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,160
They're hot! Please! Please!
I'm being electrocuted! No! No! Argh!

291
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,760
Argh! Argh! Argh!

292
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,800
Johnny!

293
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,440
Let's get another angle on this one.

294
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Just a couple more.

295
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,840
It was dead air for the DJ.

296
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Friend of yours?

297
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Yeah. And my client.

298
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,480
- I could cry.
- It's all right to cry, Ford.

299
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Crying's good.

300
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,320
Oh, shit.

301
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,320
How'd Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective
boogie his way in here? Anybody?

302
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,280
He discovered the body, sir.
LieutenantAmos, sir.

303
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,520
Oh, Fairlane, please confess.
I'll do the execution myself.

304
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,520
Nice tie, LieutenantAnus, sir.

305
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,680
Are you calling me an asshole, asshole?

306
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,920
I'm calling you an anus, Anus.
But if you prefer...

307
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,800
You think you're so hot
because you get in all the clubs...

308
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,120
..and have sex with great-lookin' women.

309
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,880
You think you're so hot just cos
you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring.

310
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,000
- You gotta admit those are good reasons.
- Get the fuck outta here, jerk-off.

311
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,520
Jerk-off? You're a jerk-off.
That's what I think of you.

312
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,880
No, that's what I call you
because you are a jerk-off.

313
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,160
- Jerk-off.
- Get the fuck outta here.

314
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,720
I did every shit job in the biz
before I became a superhero.

315
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,600
Roadie, publicist, Jimmy Osmond's
bodyguard and personal secretary...

316
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,560
Hey, I may bitch about my job,...

317
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,120
..but a great clue can really take a nothing day
and make it seem worthwhile.

318
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,640
"ArtMooney." This case is getting closed!

319
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,040
Ford. What are you running from?

320
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,080
You told me to get the fuck outta here.

321
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,480
Oh, if you're hiding something,
oh, oh... I'll have so much fun.

322
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,520
Anus, what's the bug up your ass?
Why do you hate me so much?

323
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Why do I hate you?
I'll give you a fuckin' hint. Two words.

324
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,840
- Disco Express.
- Disco Express?

325
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,200
Are you dealin' in beads or what? I mean, that
group blew dog, you know what I'm sayin'?

326
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,600
Hey, Anus. They had that...

327
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,960
That single, that real shitty single they
wanted me to push during my publicist days.

328
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,560
- "Booty Time".
- Yeah, with that lead singer,...

329
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,600
..the white Van McCoy lookalike
with the six-inch platform shoes.

330
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,680
- You know, he looked like...
- Like me.

331
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,520
Yeah. I was gonna say he looked like shit,
but... He looked like you.

332
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,320
(disco)

333
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,600
Booty time, booty time, across the USA

334
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,000
Booty time, booty time, hey-hey-hey

335
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,840
-Whoo! Booty time, booty time
-Booty time, booty time, across the USA

336
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,080
-lt's booty time, booty time
-Booty time, booty time

337
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,720
-Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- (music stops)

338
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Unbelievable. I didn't think anything
could cheer me up tonight, Lieutenant.

339
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,720
But that brilliant performance...

340
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,480
Jerk-off.

341
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Booty time! Boot my balls.

342
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,760
Can't believe he won't be alive to piss me off.

343
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,720
Here's to you, Johnny.

344
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,520
(koala whines)

345
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,160
- Ouch.
- Hey, you. Get off my cloud.

346
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Really.

347
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm hanging out with my best friend.

348
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,000
1962 Fender Stratocaster.

349
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,200
Original pick-ups, maple neck,...

350
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,080
..strung upside-down for
a left-handed motherfuckin' genius.

351
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,240
- Jimi Hendrix.
- Who cares, man? I got a case.

352
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,760
- Yeah, what? A 12-pack?
- This ain't a social call, man.

353
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,960
A hundred bucks to find my dad.

354
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,000
What? What, did he just
say what I think he said?

355
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,040
Man, don't worry. I got a clue.
See this ring on my finger?

356
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,280
Well, before my old lady ran off to Baja,
she told me my dad had this exact same ring.

357
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,800
Yabba-dabba-doo!

358
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,440
Holy Colonel Mustard.
Jeepers, you didn't mention the big clue.

359
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,720
Come on. I can't take your money.

360
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,400
You need it.

361
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,000
I don't need it that bad.

362
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,880
(knocking at door)

363
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
I can't believe I tookthe money.

364
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,560
- Ford Fairlane?
- Yeah.

365
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm Colleen Sutton.

366
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,160
I need your help.

367
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,680
I have a problem, and it pertains to
the music industry. What is it they call you?

368
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,760
- Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective?
- Please, save it. It's too early.

369
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,160
Just make yourself comfortable.

370
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
- Some juice?
- Please.

371
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,360
Sorry about the glass,
the house and my breath.

372
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,560
Mr Fairlane, I'm very rich. The kind of rich
that warps minds. Nothing offends me.

373
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,920
When I was 11, I walked in on
my father and the Shetland pony he gave me.

374
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,760
- Does that excite you?
- I don't know. I never metyour father.

375
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,960
Oh, that? Don't take it personal.

376
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,520
He normally gets up a half hour before I do,
you know? Come on. Down, boy.

377
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,520
Down, Stanley. Roseanne Barr naked.

378
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
- Gone.
- (growls)

379
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
- Stanley?
- Yeah. Stanley.

380
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,120
You know. Like the power drill?

381
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,160
I had to ask.

382
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
So tell me, who's your decorator?

383
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,080
Some fag. Charged me up the ass, you know?

384
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Fag? Ass? I'm sorry, is that a joke?

385
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,160
Yeah, in poor taste. Hey, I got
nothing against homosexuals, you know?

386
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,320
I even got one of these friends,
one of these trans-testicles.

387
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,720
(laughs)

388
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,600
Trans...testicle?

389
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,200
- I don't have a sense of humour either. Sorry.
- No shit?

390
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,320
("Purple Haze" by Jimi Hendrix)

391
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,320
Help me

392
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Help...

393
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,960
Well, nowthat we've broken the ice...

394
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,280
I need you to find my little sister.
She goes by the name of Zuzu...

395
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,920
Petals. Yeah. I know.
You want me to get her back...

396
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,800
..because you don't want her to become the
biggest sleazebag slut on the Sunset Strip,...

397
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,960
..because she's your pride and joy.

398
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
How did you know?

399
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,280
- Here. Take this picture.
- No, thanks.

400
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
I got my own.

401
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,000
Excuse me?

402
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,120
Let's see. You're her worried sister, right?

403
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,440
Yesterday, I met her worried father, who,
by the way, is five years younger than you.

404
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,840
Then I capped off the evening by watching
this guy go off like a pack of firecrackers.

405
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,920
They write about cases like this
in the private eye handbook, honey.

406
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,360
Something about a ten-foot pole.

407
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,840
5,000 should satisfy any qualms
you have about my family tree.

408
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,120
Yeah, but for now I only get a 20, right?

409
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,600
Actually, you may take it all now.

410
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Is that real money?

411
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,680
- I got some questions.
- I have no answers.

412
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,280
Thanks for the stain. Find the girl.

413
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,440
You know, speaking of stains...

414
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,360
I was just discussing bleaches
with my friend Art Mooney.

415
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
Who?

416
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,680
Zuzu Petals.

417
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Never seen her before.

418
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,800
And as for who would wanna kill Johnny
Crunch, the line forms to the left.

419
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,360
I can tell you that he moved onto
a sailboat at the Delta Marina last week.

420
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,440
Thanks.

421
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,840
- Hey, great pipes, huh?
- (laughter)

422
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,560
I've heard cats fuck
with more harmony than this kid.

423
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,880
Tell me about it. The name's Kyle Troy.

424
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,200
(Ford) What's with
this freak of fuckin' nature?

425
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,120
How does Grendel Records sign
such a wick-prick, huh?

426
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,440
But then again, Julie Grendel thinks
Jethro Tull's one of the Beverly Hillbillies.

427
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,080
My mother always said that...

428
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,200
..if you can't say
something nice about someone,...

429
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,040
..make sure they're
out of the goddamn room.

430
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,320
Hello, Ford. I'm Julian Grendel.

431
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,360
Julie Grendel. Right. Right.

432
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,200
Hey, I'm sorry.

433
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,920
Do you realise we're gonna have
to ship this "wick-prick" platinum,...

434
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,360
..just so the teenage girls will have
a compact disc cover to get wet with?

435
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,880
Come on, you gotta know
better than anybody that...

436
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,680
..there's a lot more to
the music industry than actual music.

437
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,320
You just have to learn to tune it out.
I recommend Stravinsky and Wagner.

438
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,960
I recommend Smith and Wesson.

439
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm sorry to hear about Bobby Black.

440
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,720
Terrible thing.

441
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
But a great career move.

442
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,040
His records are really climbing the charts.

443
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,840
I just gotta make sure that this Kyle Troy...
Is that his name?

444
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,120
Anyway, this Kyle Troy person
is the next... big thing.

445
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,520
You know, I was just discussing this whole
Troy thing with my old buddy Art Mooney.

446
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
You know him?

447
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,000
Nope.

448
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
No, huh?

449
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,400
(Don) What is this asshole smiling about?

450
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,320
Sorry, Ford,
I couldn't help you with your case.

451
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,840
Ford? Ford?

452
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,840
Hey, Pavarotti.

453
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,400
- Hey, what's the hassle?
- Hassle? What is this?

454
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,360
(imitates Kyle singing) What is that shit, huh?

455
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,400
I could crack my knuckles
with more rhythm than that.

456
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,080
You're killin' rock and rapin' roll, man.

457
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:27,320
Keith Richards is rollin' over in his grave.
The friggin' guy isn't even dead yet.

458
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
- You're tearin' me apart.
- Hey.

459
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,600
Hey. No, no, no.
Restyour lips. Put down the earmuffs.

460
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,920
Go ahead. Go ahead. Good, good.

461
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,720
Rock 'n' roll.
You know what rock 'n' roll is?

462
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,160
- What's Ford doin', man?
- Guys, work with me, huh?

463
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,400
I got a '65 Cadillac

464
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,760
Spare tyre on the back

465
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,200
Charge card to Goldblatt's

466
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,600
But I ain't gotyou

467
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,960
I got women to the right of me

468
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,480
I got women to the left of me

469
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,880
I got chicks all around me

470
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,320
But I ain't gotyou

471
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,800
I got a tab at the liquor store

472
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,160
I hit the number 444

473
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,440
I got a mojo, and don'tyou know

474
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,920
I'm all dressed up and no place to go

475
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,240
-I got women to the left of me
-Yeah, yeah

476
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,800
-I got women to the right of me
-Yeah, yeah

477
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,400
-I got chicks all around me
- Yeah, yeah

478
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,800
But I ain't gotyou

479
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,480
-No, I ain't gotyou
-Ow!

480
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,240
-I got a closet full of clothes
-Yeah, yeah

481
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,480
-And no matter when it goes
- Yeah, yeah

482
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,160
-I got a ring in my nose
-Yeah, yeah

483
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,600
But I ain't gotyou

484
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,280
But I ain't gotyou

485
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,480
Yeah, I ain't gotyou

486
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,680
No, I ain't gotyou

487
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,400
Kid... nowthat's rock 'n' roll, huh?

488
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,000
Jesus!

489
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,800
I coulda been a rock star,
if only I wasn't bannedfrom MTV.

490
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,520
Hey, it's a long story.
Unfortunately, I can only do that one song.

491
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,360
Well, I also do a mean "Puff
the Magic Dragon", but only in the nude.

492
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,520
It's a longer story. Oh!

493
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,760
- You guys a band?
- Sure.

494
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,480
- Got a name?
- Yeah. Pain.

495
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,040
Pain. Kooky.

496
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,360
When Don Cleveland told me
Johnny had a boat on the Delta Marina,...

497
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,480
..lforgot to ask the name of it.

498
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,200
I had a feeling
Johnny had been hidingfrom someone.

499
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,120
So the name of the boat was gonna be
something different from his personality.

500
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,800
Well, maybe not.

501
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,520
Johnny was the only guy
who could out-disgust me.

502
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,520
When we were kids,
we'd have gross-out contests.

503
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,080
I'd cough a pile of phlegm on the table.

504
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,880
He'd say "Nice try" and then pull out a straw.

505
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,320
- (squeaks)
- Ouch.

506
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,360
("Last Time in Paris" by Queensrÿche)

507
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,520
(squeaks)

508
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,360
Love boat, takin' another run...

509
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,920
The dumb bastard got involved with
something or someone he shouldn't have.

510
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
"Collie and me."

511
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,880
I'm a big Lassie fan,
so lfigured I'd take a break.

512
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,040
I hope it's the one where... Yow!

513
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,480
I'm a... I'm a pit bull. I'm a pit bull.

514
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,680
I'm a bad pit bull. Where's my Queen Colleen?

515
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,280
Queen Colleen's here.

516
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,280
What is this, the Rob Lowe channel?

517
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,080
- Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, what a cute little doggie.

518
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,080
"I'm very rich. Nothing offends me."
Come on. Nothin'? No shit, honey.

519
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,880
You got a whip stickin' out of your ass
and a guy that's fuckin' barkin'.

520
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,040
Bad dog. Bad dog. Down. Down.

521
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,120
Sit.

522
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,800
Why was Colleen so interested in Johnny?

523
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,880
Maybe they had the same taste in antiques.

524
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,640
Hello, hello.

525
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,960
You're ten seconds from the most
embarrassing moment of your fuckin' life.

526
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,160
(laughs maniacally)

527
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,120
Fuck!

528
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,720
Argh! Argh!

529
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
(giggling)

530
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,800
Damn.

531
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,320
lfelt like I'd just
played water polo in a urine tank.

532
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Who was that smiling snapper-head?

533
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,600
Why was he trying to scare me off the case?
Who's he workingfor?

534
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,760
More important, I got a school of guppies
in my underwear now. Nobody believes me.

535
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,120
(phone rings)

536
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,640
- Hit pay dirt with K-DIRT.
- Hey, Jazz. What's goin' on?

537
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,080
Bimbos and bill collectors. You?

538
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,240
- Took a late-night swim, you know?
- Uh-huh. How refreshing.

539
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,560
I got a party I wantyou to come to
tomorrow. Could be interesting.

540
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,320
It's at Colleen Sutton's Bel Air estate.

541
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,560
So dress nice, OK, honey?

542
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
- OK.
- Love you, baby.

543
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,400
(man sings "Give Me the Simple Life')

544
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,040
(Ford) Oh, man, do I hate the rich.

545
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,920
Robin Leach?

546
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,160
I fucked him. Oh!

547
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,920
Give me the simple life

548
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,840
- So you want off the case?
- Not quite.

549
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,640
I've got a code, Queen Collie.

550
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,360
I never, ever drop a case.

551
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,560
Besides, I used all your money
to pay my bills, so I sort of owe you.

552
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,320
I don't need money.
What I need are questions answered.

553
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,520
Question number one.

554
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,000
Can I have some money?

555
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,240
I'm only kidding.

556
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
Hey, look.

557
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,040
Johnny Crunch was a good friend of mine.

558
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:54,280
He didn't bark like a dog for me.
However, I want to know why he had to die.

559
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,280
Look. No one told you to solve a murder.

560
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,360
Just find a girl.

561
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,280
Excuse me a moment... honey.

562
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:26,760
Jazz, I told you to dress nice, not nice.
I mean, what did you thinkthis was? A date?

563
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,640
All right, look, sweetheart. You look beautiful.

564
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,960
Afterwards, I'll take you out,
throw a burger down your throat...

565
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,360
You're truly a man among men.
What do you want from me?

566
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,480
Look. This Colleen Sutton chick
I was just rappin' with?

567
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,920
She's full of surprises and full of shit, OK?

568
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,920
I wantyou to secretly
keep tabs on her for me.

569
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,640
All right. Good. Hey, wait. Hors devors.

570
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,720
Snapper-head. Hey, food boy.

571
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,480
Where the hell are you goin'?

572
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,840
Some like the high road, I like the low road

573
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,480
Free from the care and strife

574
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,760
Sounds corny and seedy

575
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Butyes, indeedy

576
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,680
Give me the simple life

577
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,640
Ah! Stop following me.

578
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,240
- Excuse me. I was...
- Give it up, girl.

579
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,600
Just take this.

580
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,840
I can't afford to have it right now.

581
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
Oh! Ooh.

582
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
Ugh.

583
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
Hello, Ford.

584
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
- I'm hip.
- Mm.

585
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,680
Well, I must say, you're
an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhoea.

586
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,000
And the ones who love inside

587
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,360
Some like the high road, I like the low road

588
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,880
Why mess around...

589
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,040
It's good to see you too, Julie.
Say hello to my assistant, Jazz.

590
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,280
- Hi.
- Mm.

591
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,440
Ford. I thinkthat somebody's
trying to rip my company off.

592
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,520
I've tried the Yellow Pages.
Now I think it's your turn.

593
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,640
Shark is served.

594
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,840
I guess now is a bad time to discuss it.
I'm such a big fan of shark meat.

595
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,200
- So nice to meetyou.
- (gags) Nice to meetyou.

596
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,960
See you.

597
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,520
Come on, Ford.

598
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,640
Your shark steak, sir.

599
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,920
What are you lookin' at?
What's the matter with you? Hey, Jazz.

600
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,120
- What? You gotyour panties in a bunch?
- Shut up. Look down the back of my dress.

601
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,400
Whoa!

602
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,280
- This party's pickin' up.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.

603
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,000
- Where'd you get this?
- A gift from the ice queen, Colleen.

604
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,360
And it's not even my birthday.

605
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,640
I wouldn't trust that babe
as far as I could bowl her.

606
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,080
Found out she'd been nailin' Johnny.

607
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,400
Don't even ask aboutZuzu Petals.

608
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,960
(beeping)

609
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,400
Play that funky music, white boy.

610
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,720
It's a computer disc. Let me check it out.

611
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,480
I knew Colleen had something up her sleeve.

612
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
You did good.

613
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,840
Why don'tyou make eye contact
when you say that?

614
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,640
I can't. That dress. I mean, why don't we just...

615
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,920
Celebrate? Like when we solved the case of
the Bad White Bluesman? Forget that, man.

616
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,160
Jazz... Come here.

617
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,280
Maybe I should be thankful
that was a foodless kiss.

618
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,600
We had such a great weekend, you know.
You had a good time, I had a good time...

619
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:10,840
OK. Why don'tyou just stop, before
you make some crude reference to Stanley.

620
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,120
Hey, Stanley had a good time too, you know.

621
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,960
Yeah? Well, that weekend was a mistake.

622
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,560
Hey, look. I'm sorry I made you
clean the toilets and the bathtubs.

623
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,720
I mean, who did all the work in bed?

624
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,840
- Oh.
- Oh, come... Jazz! I'm...

625
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,680
- (growls)
- What'd I say? Come on.

626
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,040
Chicks.

627
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,160
Some people play hard to get.

628
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,440
I play hard to want.

629
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,880
I'd always loved Jazz,
cos she despised me for who I truly am.

630
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,920
Like that time we were at her parents'
wedding anniversary and I told that joke:

631
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
.."What's the definition of vagina?"

632
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,600
"The box a penis comes in." Oh!

633
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,920
I was stuck with a case where Zuzu Petals
and ArtMooney were battling out...

634
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,680
..for the "Lamest Clue of My Career" award.

635
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,520
It's just me and you tonight, honey.

636
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,720
What are you doin'?

637
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,680
Look at the mess you're makin', huh?
Who's gonna clean that up?

638
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,480
I'm Kurt Loder on MTV News. Police
say that Black Plague singer Bobby Black...

639
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,600
..was not the victim of a drug overdose
as was at first suspected.

640
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,920
Police have no suspects yet
and are asking all Black Plague fans...

641
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,560
..not to show up at the funeral, which will be
held at the Hollywood Cemetery at midnight.

642
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,920
Right now, as a tribute,
here's the lastvideo by Bobby Black.

643
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,120
Would you look at that?

644
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,560
So Zuzu Petals was
a groupie of Bobby Black's.

645
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,200
What did Bobby's friends
Johnny and Colleen want from her?

646
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:26,000
I'd hoped to find out at Bobby's funeral,
cos this case was gettin' closed.

647
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,280
All right. That's 100 each. Come on.

648
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,800
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Right. Get in there.

649
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,080
Got those Plague invites here.

650
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,280
Scalpin' at a funeral.
You're a pretty sleazy guy.

651
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,120
Thanks. You interested?
It's festival seating, so...

652
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,400
- How much?
- 300.

653
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,400
- 300? You charged the chicks one.
- Hey, they blew me.

654
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,880
300 comin' up.

655
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
Bobby!

656
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,160
Jeez. Am I the only one that paid full price?

657
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,280
Ever see this chick before?
Ever see this chick?

658
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,360
He was so good.

659
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,360
He was one of the greats.
Ever see this chick around?

660
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,160
Is this a trick question?

661
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,160
Zuzu Petals? Zuzu Petals?

662
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,200
Yes! Who killed Bobby Black?

663
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,280
- Um...
- Who killed Johnny? Who's Art Mooney?

664
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,640
- Talkto me. Talkto me!
- I don't know.

665
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,040
I'm so scared. Help me.

666
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,640
Hey, baby. A simple thank you would suffice.

667
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,280
Fluck you!

668
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,920
Oh, fluck. Fluck. Stanley, talkto me.

669
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,800
- Hello, hello.
- Argh!

670
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,720
(Zuzu screams)

671
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,760
- Damn.
- (phone rings)

672
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,520
- Hit pay dirt with K-DIRT.
- Hello, hello.

673
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,560
Radio contests, Ford.

674
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,360
- Come on, man.
- Hey. Aren'tyou supposed to be dead?

675
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,520
Why don'tyou come back, you chickenshit?

676
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,880
Oh, Ford.
I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.

677
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,240
- Watch out. Get out of the way.
- (screams)

678
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,400
- God, I love this job.
- And I thought all we got was a dental plan.

679
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,200
- Hey.
- Hey. He took Lydia.

680
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,920
Ah!

681
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,080
Mom...

682
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,160
(screaming)

683
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,520
Watch out.

684
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,600
(laughs maniacally)

685
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,440
You ain't smilin' no more, asshole.

686
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,000
Oh, but I am, Ford.

687
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,680
Oh, shit!

688
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,800
No, thanks. I've got my own.

689
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,440
(phone rings)

690
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,440
Fuck you, you dirtbag sack of shit.

691
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,480
And a good evening to you too, kind sir.
Sorry to interrupt.

692
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,880
Thoughtyou might like to know
that the CD is coming up worthless.

693
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,280
And I also found out
why Colleen Sutton is so damn rich.

694
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:27,360
Besides the Sutton Estate, she also gets
a little additional green à la alimony from...

695
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,560
..dramatic pause... your pal Julian Grendel.

696
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,000
- Her ex-husband.
- That explains a lot, but I can't talk now.

697
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,480
- You're with one of your bimbos, aren'tyou?
- It's a little more complicated than that.

698
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,040
Look... Hold on. I got another call. Hold on.

699
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,880
Yeah, hello? Smiley?
I'm sorry. That was my assistant.

700
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,680
Your assistant is quite special.

701
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,560
I look forward to raping her atyour funeral.

702
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,040
Wait. Hold on, Smiley.

703
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:03,360
Come on, get. On second thought...
I'm only kidding. Come here. Come here.

704
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,240
Damn, baby.
I hope you filled out some organ donor cards.

705
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,560
Excuse me. Excuse me, driver?

706
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:19,680
Driver? Hi. Now, I knowthis is, like,
a car chase, but I have gotto go wee-wee.

707
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,040
So if we could just pull over,
it'd be great, at any...

708
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,320
Hang on, baby, here we go.

709
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,560
Come on. Come on, Smiley.

710
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,520
- Bobby!
- Bobby!

711
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,040
Oh, there's Bobby. Hi, sweetheart.

712
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,880
Shit.

713
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,360
Boy! You morticians
really know howto party.

714
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,200
Ah! Ah!

715
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,640
(Zuzu sighs)

716
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,760
(gasps)

717
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,840
- Are you mad?
- No, I'm ecstatic.

718
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,880
Get outta the car!

719
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,960
- (sirens approaching)
- OK.

720
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,120
I can't believe anybody could have
so much fuckin' fun at a funeral, Fairlane.

721
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,800
- You do Bar Mitzvahs?
- The son of a bitch you want's in this limo.

722
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,640
Yeah, sure, whatever. You know,
I really wish I could get mad atyou, Ford.

723
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:16,640
But guess who just found out
who killed Bobby Black and Johnny Crunch?

724
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,520
A psycho groupie killer. I got an anonymous
letter says she killed the both of them.

725
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,120
I hate to interrupt, but I think you spent
too much time in discos during the '70s.

726
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,320
The Village People rotted your brain.

727
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,720
That's the difference
between a great investigator like me...

728
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,000
..and a piece of Spam like you.

729
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,760
Spam.

730
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,360
You're a piece of Spam.
That's what I think of you.

731
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,720
No, I call you a piece of Spam
because that's whatyou are.

732
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,880
Spam.

733
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,760
See, you look at this picture,
all you see is the beauty.

734
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,640
- I see the beast.
- Lieutenant?

735
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,880
Yeah, there's no one in the limo, sir.

736
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,960
(both) What?

737
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,240
All right, I'll talkto you later.
But don't try finding this girl on your own.

738
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,880
Trust me on this one. This broad is lethal.

739
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,000
Yeah. Whatever you say, boss.

740
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,720
You can get cream to try to kill
whatever that is down there.

741
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,960
Keeping Zuzu away from the disco duck
wasn't too fuckin'hard.

742
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,280
But I'd have to wait to interrogate her.

743
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,360
Colleen's on a revenge trip
against her ex-husband.

744
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,600
Julian Grendel told me
his company's been gettin' ripped off.

745
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,680
Makes total sense.

746
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:34,280
Bobby and his friend, Colleen's lover Johnny
Crunch, find out about her little scheme.

747
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,640
She has 'em killed.

748
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,440
If that's so, who the hell are you?

749
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,240
Zuzu Petals.

750
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,640
Don't talkto me any more.

751
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,400
Yum, yum. Tee-wee!

752
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,080
Talking to Zuzu was like
masturbating with a cheese grater.

753
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,400
Slightly amusing, but mostly painful.

754
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,760
Zuzu!

755
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,720
Zuzu?

756
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,240
Zuzu. Zuzu. What happened?
Come on, honey.

757
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,960
I'm so sorry about everything I said.

758
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,160
Come on, just be all right.
Talkto me, honey. Come on.

759
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,160
- That's it. Keep chewing.
- Huh...

760
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,800
- That's it.
- Fluck!

761
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,120
Great video, huh?

762
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,440
- Are you OK?
- OK? I just blew up.

763
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:43,280
I feel orgasmic.

764
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,520
My guitar.

765
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,920
My axe.

766
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,360
My axe!

767
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,560
Colleen fuckin' Sutton.

768
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,640
I knew it!

769
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,840
Ford? You got something
cooking in the microwave?

770
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,600
Get out!

771
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,480
- Get out.
- Oh, wait, wait. My purse.

772
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,560
"Wait, my purse"? Get outta here. Come on!

773
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,160
Jump, nitwit!

774
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,440
Well, maybe it was just a potpie.

775
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,960
I guess not.

776
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,560
I tried to stop 'em, man. I'm sorry.

777
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,680
Hey. Hey.

778
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,160
Hey. Who did this to you?

779
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,600
These two guys in real long cowboy coats
and real nice suits. I thinkArmani.

780
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,880
They went through your stuff.
I did whatyou would've done.

781
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,360
- Yeah. Run to a phone and call the cops.
- Fuckthat. I mean, to heck with that.

782
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,600
I kicked their ass.
I tried. There were two of'em.

783
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,960
All right. Let's go to the hospital.

784
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,800
- I tried to help you.
- Hey, I appreciate it.

785
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,920
Hey, where's my dad?
Have you even looked for him yet?

786
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,440
- I've got some leads.
- You're a liar, man. You don't care.

787
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,480
You don't care about nothing.

788
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,000
- Where you goin'?
- Oh. He seems nice.

789
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,080
Shut up. Just...just shut up.

790
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,200
Ford? Bad news.

791
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,080
I chipped a nail.

792
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,280
Hey, the boys in the garage
brought my baby back.

793
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,480
Oh, my God!

794
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,560
(horn blares)

795
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,920
Why the music industry?

796
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,920
Why not Ford Fairlane,
the fisherman's detective, huh?

797
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,360
Wouldn't that be great?
Howtough could it be?

798
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,120
"Ford, somebody switched
the lures in my fuckin' tackle box."

799
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,400
"Hey, Ford. Somebody sabotaged my bait."

800
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,640
- OK. Here comes...
- All right.

801
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,360
All right.

802
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,200
- Hey. You need a lift?
- (both) Yeah.

803
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,360
- (both) Fuck you!
- Motherfucker.

804
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,320
Hi, private-eye guy!
Remember me, Melodi?

805
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,440
Oh, wow. Hiding out from cold-blooded
killers. The sisters are going to die.

806
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,600
("Cradle of Love" by Billy Idol)

807
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,400
So, this is my sorority.
I think you'll really like the girls.

808
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,720
Well, rock the cradle of love

809
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,080
Rock the cradle of love

810
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,760
Yes, the cradle of love

811
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,080
Don't rock easily, it's true

812
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,840
Yeah

813
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,360
It burned like a ball of fire

814
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,840
When the rebel took
a little child bride to tease, yeah

815
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,920
So go easy, yeah

816
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,320
Oh

817
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,280
Cos love cuts a million ways

818
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:52,320
Shakes the devil when he misbehaves

819
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,640
I ain't nobody's fool

820
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,720
Come on, shake it up, whatever I do

821
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,200
Rock the cradle of love...

822
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,160
Hey, troops. Here's
the rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.

823
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,240
(music stops)

824
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,080
Oh!

825
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,440
- Hi.
- Hey... Hey...

826
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,200
Maybe I did die in the explosion, you know?

827
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,280
(phone rings)

828
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,720
- Ford Fairlane.
- (Ford) Hey, Jazz.

829
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,960
Ford?

830
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,280
You would not believe
what I went through today.

831
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:32,120
Colleen's thugs tried to kill me. You believe
that? They left her hat as a goodbye kiss.

832
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:37,000
You know? I'm callin' from
the Ai Eta Pi sorority house, huh? Mm.

833
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,760
Mm. They blew up my house, my car...

834
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,720
And let me tell you something. My
koala bear's not in such great shape either.

835
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,000
- That's too bad.
- "That's too bad."

836
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,800
"That's too bad" she tells me.
That's all you can say?

837
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,560
Yes, Ford. That's about all I can say.

838
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,400
Well, look. Stop playing games
over there and come here. I gotta see you.

839
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,040
(dialling tone)

840
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:05,200
So anyway, Springsteen says to Madonna
"Who could fuck in this weather?" Oh!

841
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,920
- Does Van Halen sleep in the nude?
- Does Debbie Gibson sleep with Van Halen?

842
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,560
- Rub my neck, huh?
- Is Sting really an asshole?

843
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,960
If Axl Rose was reincarnated as a black
woman, would it be Jody Watley or Aretha?

844
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:20,360
Sisters! Sisters, would you chill out?
Give Ford a break.

845
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,040
What do you say we induct him
as an honorary member?

846
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,160
(all) Yeah!

847
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,440
If either one of you ever has a son,
I hope his dog dies.

848
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,440
You really shouldn't have said that.

849
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,520
Yeah. It's a tough business.

850
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,440
- Bye-bye.
- See ya. One...

851
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,960
Two...

852
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,040
Three!

853
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,520
Whoo-hoo!

854
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,680
(all chant) Qantas, jujubes,
salcido, Ford Fairlane.

855
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,720
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

856
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:09,320
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

857
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:14,400
- Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.
- One, two...

858
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,640
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

859
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,640
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

860
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:29,120
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

861
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:33,400
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

862
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,040
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

863
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,960
- Everybody blow.
- Quantas, ju...

864
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,000
Where are you going?

865
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,520
Move!

866
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,280
- Hey!
- Come on!

867
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,320
- Oh!
- Oh, jeez!

868
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,160
Come on. It's cut-our-losses time, man.

869
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,720
Oh, man, look at that! Goddamn!

870
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,400
Dudes. They executed my Vette.

871
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,680
Need a... lift?

872
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,840
(moans in pain)

873
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,240
Jazz!

874
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,760
- What happened?
- Why do you have to have...

875
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,120
..an office on the second floor?

876
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,440
- I came to warn you.
- I'll fuckin' kill them. Are you OK, huh?

877
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,200
- Yes.
- You all right?

878
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:16,200
They tried to get this worthless CD,
but I had it hidden in a special place.

879
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,560
Once again, I came through.

880
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,000
Damn red-numbered bullshit CD.

881
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:25,000
Look, I have one. Bobby gave it to me
the night that he passed away.

882
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,480
It's good. It's really avant-garde.
You can dance to it.

883
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:34,640
Does yours go, like,
bzzz, eeek, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz...?

884
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,440
- Zuzu?
- Yeah, right. Birdbrain? Shut up, please.

885
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,200
- Melodi, take Jazz to the hospital, OK?
- OK, sure.

886
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,360
Wait a second. I want to see
if this is better than the last one.

887
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,680
I don't need no CD to tell me Colleen Sutton's
behind this whole thing, all right?

888
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,200
- Let's go.
- Come on.

889
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:54,120
I'll be at Julie Grendel's to see if he knows
what a whore thief his ex-piece-of-shit wife is.

890
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,360
Come on, move.
Come on, would you, please? Stupid!

891
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,600
Why have you come to my planet, huh?

892
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,720
You're pure scum.

893
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,000
(sniggers)

894
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,320
Colleen, you're a drag.

895
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,080
Julie, baby! What's goin' on, huh?

896
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:18,040
Queen Colleen. You're here just in time to see
me do what I refer to as solving the case.

897
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,240
It's cute. I think you'll like it.

898
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,640
Colleen's been ripping off
her ex-husband here's company.

899
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,280
And she's been murdering
to keep it a secret.

900
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,960
That's a pretty nifty theory.

901
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,240
Colleen!

902
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,960
Colleen.

903
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,600
- Nice dress.
- Wait. My purse.

904
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,240
- Ar... Ar...
- Aardvarks?

905
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,480
Julian's smuggling aardvarks
into the country?

906
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,520
- Art...
- Artichokes?

907
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:52,360
Art... Mooney... stupid!

908
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,840
- Thanks. I needed that.
- (Zuzu gasps)

909
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,720
You sick, confusing motherfuckers.

910
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,440
Gimme the three discs, Ford.

911
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:09,400
Bobby's, Colleen's and Johnny's.

912
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,560
Three CDs?

913
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,760
Shit. Just start torturin' me, man.

914
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,160
I didn't even know Johnny had a disc.

915
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:23,120
I'm not in the mood for any of that "Don't play
games with me, Mr Fairlane" bullshit.

916
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,960
Don't play games with me, Mr...

917
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,120
Did you say you don't have the...?

918
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,600
Torture you?

919
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,440
I'm not gonna torture you, Ford.

920
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,640
Not her, Ford, butyour best friend.

921
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:43,880
A 1962 Fender Stratocaster
with original pick-ups and maple neck...

922
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:48,160
..and strung upside down
for a left-handed genius - Jimi Hendrix.

923
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,760
- That's something else entirely.
- No!

924
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,400
Argh!

925
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:56,640
That's the same sound
your koala bear made when we hung it.

926
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:00,520
Don'tyou thinkthis guitar would look
better with Ford's name carved in it?

927
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,960
- Come on!
- (henchmen) Oh, yeah!

928
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,040
(Ford grunts)

929
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,880
Rape!

930
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,920
(Ford) Come on! OK. OK.

931
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,120
OK. OK.

932
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,040
Boy, you guys are tough. OK, you got me.

933
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,680
All right, I gotyour discs, asshole.

934
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:29,800
They're in a very safe place, with instructions
that they be sent directly to the police...

935
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,120
..if I don't make a call by seven o'clock.

936
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,640
So, if you'll excuse us...

937
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,200
Well, it's 7.30, Ford.
You really should get a watch.

938
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,360
Ford, Ford, Ford.

939
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,400
How about a last drink?
I'm running a little late.

940
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,840
We're giving a party tonight at the club
to introduce Kyle Troy to the world.

941
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,160
Everyone in the industry's gonna be there,
including our friend Don Cleveland.

942
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,440
- Yeah? What about Don?
- Before Kyle Troy does his first set,...

943
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,880
..Don will have his head blown off.

944
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,000
Next week, the newspapers will reveal...

945
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,560
..that Don was partners with Bobby, Collie
and Johnny in the Grendel Records scam.

946
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,720
And he killed 'em to pay off some debt
to the Mob or something lame like that.

947
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,240
And then he got iced.
It's a lot more tasteful than it sounds.

948
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:25,600
You know, I cannot believe
thatyou guys actually hung a koala bear.

949
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,920
That is just so graphic.
You know, I am still in shock here.

950
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:33,120
- Is she for real?
- I'm afraid so. You want her?

951
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,840
- ..but that was just a dream. I don't think...
- (all) Shut up!

952
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,960
(sighs)

953
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,160
You know, Julie, you're the goods.

954
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:46,560
And even though I might be perturbed you're
gonna kill me, I gotta salute your toughness.

955
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,520
Julian Grendel,
guys like you do grow on trees.

956
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,600
Here's to you, buddy... suckin' my dick.

957
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,320
Take a free shot, boss.

958
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,480
Sure.

959
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,800
(Grendel) Moron.

960
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,880
Zuzu.

961
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:17,760
- Zuzu, are you OK?
- Oh. Another trick question, right?

962
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,840
Open the window.

963
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,080
Shit.

964
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:31,800
- Hello?
- When I say "now", you run for the door, OK?

965
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,880
Eugh. What...

966
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,840
Kill him.

967
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:47,080
But not quickly. Ciao, Ford.

968
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,880
Anybody else in this situation
would shit a Miata.

969
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,080
- Ow. Come on...
- But I had a plan.

970
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,400
Not the greatest plan, but hey.

971
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,040
The old "gum on the earring
in the socket" trick never failed me.

972
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,120
I'd never even tried it.

973
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,920
- Now!
- Argh!

974
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,600
Argh!

975
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,520
- Out this way.
- No. This way.

976
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,720
I'd blown the case wide open.

977
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:27,040
It's too bad that my clients were dead and
that I had no actual proof against Grendel.

978
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,320
And now I'm on top
of the Capitol Records building?

979
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,160
So much for
climbin' down the fire escape shit.

980
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:38,840
Johnny and Colleen were lucky to be dead,
barkin'in that big chuck wagon in the sky.

981
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:43,520
At least they knew who the fuck
ArtMooney was. I'm losin'my mind! Argh!

982
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,280
- Top of the world, Ma!
- (both) Mm!

983
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,880
- I left my purse. I...
- Fuckthe purse. We're gonna die!

984
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,320
And you say I never take you anywhere.

985
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,960
Ah, shit.

986
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,080
There is something so wrong with you.
Come on.

987
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,880
Come on. Here, here. Come on, you can do it.

988
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,240
You all right? Come on.
It's all right. If you fall, I'll make it.

989
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,200
(Zuzu) OK.

990
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,440
- Move, stupid.
- I made it. OK?

991
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,480
Um... Uh... Here.

992
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,200
- (gunshot)
- Ah! Oops.

993
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,840
The building is a symbol
of the music industry,...

994
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,480
..a business where
anything can happen.

995
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,000
And usually does.

996
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,120
Oops.

997
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,640
- Bull's-eye.
- Oh, ick.

998
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,560
- Ick.
- What did you throwthe gun away for?

999
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,640
- It just, oh... Yuck.
- Come on.

1000
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,400
- Hello, hello.
- Oh! Hold me!

1001
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,880
- Ford, help!
- (Smiley laughs maniacally)

1002
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,360
Ah! Ah!

1003
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,360
Hello, hello, fuckface.

1004
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,000
- Yabba-dabba-doo!
- (Zuzu) What?

1005
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,920
- (Ford) The ring!
- (Zuzu) What ring?

1006
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,880
It's the kid's father. I can't.

1007
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,520
Who do you think you are, Ford?
The tooth fairy? Kill! Kill! Kill!

1008
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,640
- It's a long story. You knowthe kid?
- What kid? Oh, the kid.

1009
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,320
- The Flintstone ring?
- The nice one?

1010
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,520
Yeah, the nice kid I hang with.

1011
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,600
My hair. My hair.

1012
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,960
- Hey, Zuzu.
- Huh?

1013
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,040
- Don't worry. I'll work it out.
- OK.

1014
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,400
Excuse me while I kiss the sky!

1015
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:53,560
Hey, Zuzu, I found my guitar!
I found my guitar!

1016
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,960
It's all scratched up.

1017
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,400
(tearful) It's all scratched up, Zuzu.

1018
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,800
- Ford? I'll take her with me!
- Get off of me!

1019
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,040
- I swear I will.
- Oh, Ford!

1020
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,720
You're tearin' me apart!

1021
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,320
I'm sorry, Jimi.

1022
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,480
What the fuck...?

1023
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,640
Say hello to Liberace, asshole.

1024
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:32,080
Come on. Come on. Come on, you can do it.

1025
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,160
Come on. Come on.

1026
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,520
Thank you.

1027
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:45,280
Thanks. Because, I mean,
I know how much that thang meant to you.

1028
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,320
Well, hello, Mr Tongue. What a perv!

1029
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,240
Yeah. You wish.

1030
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,480
- (Ford) Don't look down.
- OK.

1031
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:14,640
'Scuse me. Could you tell us howto
get to Mann's Chinese Theatre?

1032
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,240
- Go backto Michigan, asswipe.
- No, we're from Wisconsin.

1033
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,560
Yeah, and I'm from my dad's penis.
Get outta here.

1034
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,640
(horn beeps)

1035
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,800
How'd it go?
Did you get more proof against Colleen?

1036
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,280
Colleen's innocent. And dead.

1037
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,680
Well, I figured something out.

1038
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,760
These binary discs?

1039
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,800
They've got hidden bits that can be revealed
when interfacing with a third CD.

1040
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:49,280
Oh, Ford! Look how cute.
Your friend's got his own star.

1041
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,200
What friend?

1042
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,560
You know, thatArt guy.

1043
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,880
(Ford) Art. Art Mooney!

1044
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,800
Art. Art, baby!

1045
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,880
Art!

1046
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,360
Art, baby. Third CD, anyone, huh?

1047
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,960
I don't need no funky attitude

1048
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:23,880
You spend so much time trying to be rude

1049
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,800
Why the funky attitude?

1050
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,720
Oh, no, I don't care how you're feelin'

1051
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,800
I don't need no funky attitude...

1052
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,520
Hey.

1053
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,680
Julie! You sure know how it's done.

1054
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,360
Thank you, Don. Uh, could I
talkto you in private a moment?

1055
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:04,440
B-i-n-g-o. And Bingo was his name-o.

1056
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:09,960
'Scuse me, but all I see is a condom factory
in Johannesburg, South Africa. Now what...

1057
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,880
I believe the word
you're lookin' for is "proof'.

1058
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,200
It's a front for a pirate disc operation.

1059
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,960
Grendel's secretly counterfeiting
his own company's stock.

1060
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,360
We're dealin' with a very sick puppy here.

1061
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,680
Oh, my God. The door's locked.
We're gonna have to crawl down.

1062
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,760
No. I knew it. I knew it.

1063
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,280
Psych!

1064
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,520
Moron.

1065
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:44,680
What can I say, Don? You're a great producer.
You're a great friend.

1066
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I'm gonna miss you.

1067
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,600
What can I tell you? It's business.

1068
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,240
With friends like you, who needs enemas?

1069
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,640
Dump the body in, shall we say, Chinatown.

1070
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,240
(Ford) Hey, Don.

1071
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,840
- How's the high blood pressure?
- Wait until the last minute, Ford!

1072
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,360
Can somebody tell me
what the fuck is going on, like, slowly?

1073
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:32,960
You see... it all started...
with this condom factory...

1074
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,320
I'll write you a letter. Come on.

1075
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,520
All right. You threw me
through a plate-glass window.

1076
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,080
I hityou with my car.
I thinkthat made for a fair fight.

1077
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,840
Maybe not.

1078
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,920
(cheering)

1079
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,920
The truth is,
there's a lot of love in this room tonight.

1080
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,880
But I... I've...

1081
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,480
- I've talked long enough.
- Oh, no!

1082
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:14,080
Nowthe momentyou've all been waiting for.
I'd like you to meet the voice of the '90s.

1083
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,920
Ladies and gentlemen, Kyle Troy.

1084
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
(cheering)

1085
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,320
(henchman coughs)

1086
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,520
Ow. Shit, man.

1087
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,760
I used to be just like you.

1088
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,760
Abusing women
to hide my emotional insecurities.

1089
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,640
You're seconds away from
the most embarrassing moment of your life.

1090
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,920
Sam the Sleazebag to the rescue.

1091
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,680
You said something about three CDs?

1092
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:31,640
Uh, Ford... I'll do...
I'll do anything, man. I mean, we don't...

1093
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,720
And may I suggest for dessert...
the copies I made?

1094
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,000
- Fuck me.
- Yeah, maybe later.

1095
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:46,160
But first, why don'tyou tell me why
you're rippin' your own company off?

1096
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,240
I read Billboard.

1097
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:53,480
I couldn't believe how much Grendel Records
made and how little Julie Grendel got.

1098
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:58,400
It's amazing how much you gotta pay
the actual artists who create the music, huh?

1099
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,160
Those ingrate bastards really take a bite.

1100
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,760
Look, Bobby Black found out about
your little African bogus disc company.

1101
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,840
Stole your computer records.
Wanna tell me about it?

1102
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,240
Bobby was stupid. He got angry.
His friend Johnny was more stupid.

1103
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,840
He got greedy. Tried to blackmail me.

1104
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,840
Me! Colleen knew better.

1105
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,960
She knew what a monster I could be.

1106
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:27,640
Poor Colleen just wanted no one to get hurt.
That's why I waited so long to kill her.

1107
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,720
Face it. Making money is
the only art form left open to innovation.

1108
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,480
Anybody says they're in this industry
cos they like music is a lying,...

1109
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,880
..pathetic piece of shit!

1110
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,080
(outraged murmuring)

1111
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:45,400
Or a total idiot like this Kyle Toy,
or Troy, or whatever the hell his name is.

1112
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:49,360
I've dedicated my life to making sure
that this industry is so disgusting,...

1113
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,240
..so sleazy and so corrupt
it would have to self-destruct.

1114
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,400
Two sambuca milkshakes.

1115
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,920
I even pissed in the punchbowl!

1116
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,560
You're a hell of a guy. You knowthat, Julie?

1117
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:06,480
Since you're on a roll,
anything else you wanna talk about?

1118
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,280
Why? You hiding a mike or something?

1119
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,680
No. I am.

1120
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,760
You little bitch.

1121
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,280
Why do birds... Hey!

1122
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,440
Suddenly appear?

1123
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,760
On the day thatyou were born,
the angels got together

1124
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,840
And decided to create a...

1125
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:36,920
Well, Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective.

1126
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,640
- You're out of the business.
- Ford!

1127
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,800
Shake me, Jazz.

1128
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,480
"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida", baby.

1129
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,520
You're fired, Julie.

1130
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,920
Ford.

1131
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,800
Look. Look who I found. It's Damion Flemm.

1132
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,320
He loves me, and he's taking me to Japan.

1133
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,960
It's Disco Appreciation Night
at the Coconut Teazer. The one night...

1134
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,720
Sorry, sir, but we got a report
that the psycho-killer groupie was here.

1135
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,440
- Take good care of her.
- That shouldn't be too hard.

1136
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,160
- Yeah, sure.
- There she is with Fairlane.

1137
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,920
Harbouring a fugitive, Ford?

1138
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
You're goin' down.

1139
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,440
Sexual favours won't help, baby.

1140
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,600
Cos it's booty time. Booty...

1141
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,360
(falsetto) Booty time, booty time...

1142
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,840
Happy viewing.

1143
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,640
Jerk-off.

1144
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,480
- What'd you say?
- I didn't say nothin', man.

1145
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,680
Shit, man! You're the lead singer
of Disco Express.

1146
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,520
"Booty Time" is the only white disco
song as far as I'm concerned.

1147
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,560
- There's more where that came from, man.
- I'm listenin'.

1148
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,120
(both)Booty time,
booty time across the USA

1149
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:18,480
Booty time, booty time, yeah, yeah, yeah

1150
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,160
- Isn't Sam great?
- Do you wanna come out with us?

1151
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:24,400
I can't. Anybody see my assistant, Jazz?

1152
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:28,240
She left. She said something
aboutyou being a real asshole.

1153
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,800
Right, right.

1154
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,880
That sounds right.

1155
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,440
("The Wind Cries Mary" by Richie Sambora)

1156
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,120
Jazz is gone and I got the blues.

1157
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:47,040
A lot of fuckin' things are gone
and I got the blues.

1158
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:51,400
I'll tell you, bein'an ultra-cool
rock 'n'roll superhero...

1159
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:54,200
It sounded a lot better
in the brochure.

1160
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:00,560
I can't believe it took a bunch of phoney CDs
to make me lose all my self-worth and shit.

1161
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:05,600
I was just gonna take a nice long... nap.

1162
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,880
Hello, hello.

1163
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,560
I don't believe this.

1164
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:20,400
Why did I pause before I pushed you, huh?
You know, if you weren't that kid's father...

1165
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:23,720
- What are you talking about?
- The ring, man.

1166
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,880
What about it? I stole it.

1167
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,720
(giggles)

1168
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:34,160
From some idiot in Fresno
that I strangled lastyear.

1169
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,920
Perfect end
to a perfect evening, huh?

1170
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,520
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1171
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:49,560
I mean, I start by having my koala bear hung,
and my house and car blown up.

1172
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:53,000
That was just the beginning of the evening.
Just getting started.

1173
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:58,040
Then I get to climb down the Capitol Records
building. Great exercise. I recommend it.

1174
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:02,000
Then my guitar, my axe -
the one thing I love, next to Stanley -

1175
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,600
..is nowtoothpicks for
the Hollywood homeless.

1176
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:08,320
And then after I torch your boss,
my girlfriend leaves me.

1177
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,000
She leaves me, hey? Terrific.

1178
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,760
And now... now I get to die.

1179
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,040
You're breakin' me heart.

1180
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,440
What's the point?

1181
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:26,000
The point is I wanna
go out man-to-man. Just me and you.

1182
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,600
Put down the gun, let's go at it.
Come on, you fuckin' sissy.

1183
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,160
Are you afraid of me?
Come on, mano-to-mano.

1184
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,680
Fisticuffs, baby. Let's go at it,
justyou and me. No one's around.

1185
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,880
Come on, I've fuckin' had it. Let's go!

1186
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,560
(drops gun)

1187
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:53,360
All right. Any way you want it.

1188
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,080
You crack me up, you knowthat?

1189
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,960
What kind of idiot throws his gun down?
Use your head.

1190
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,080
Is there somethin' wrong with you or what?

1191
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:09,400
I mean... Look. Look whatyou did.

1192
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,040
Thanks for workin'.

1193
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:24,640
Thanks for bein' a jerk-off.
I mean, "man-to-man", "mano-to-mano".

1194
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:29,000
What the hell does "mano-to-mano" mean?
Use your head.

1195
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,880
Snapper-head.

1196
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,920
So here I am.

1197
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,240
The bad guys are dead,
my life's ruined, and the case is closed.

1198
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:47,680
Hey, what else can I say?
At least things can't get any more depressing.

1199
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,520
So... did you find my dad?

1200
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,400
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1201
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:58,200
I got some good news...
and I got some bad news.

1202
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:03,000
The good news is, I found him.
The bad news...

1203
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,960
It's me.

1204
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,120
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?

1205
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,880
Hey, a guy tries to make a commitment,
I gotta eat shit?

1206
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,240
Well, just tell me who my real father is.

1207
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:26,400
