<i>"In between the years

5
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:54,466
<i>" There was an age undreamed of, </i>

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,477
Do not speak, my love.
Do not speak.

30
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:12,956
- I must see my child, before I die.

31
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,412
Name your son.

32
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:05,933
His--name--is--Conan.

33
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:34,305
When a Cimmerian, feels thirst.

34
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,300
It is the thirst for blood.

35
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:41,339
When he feels cold..

36
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,698
It is the cold edge of steel.

37
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,603
But the courage of a Cimmerian is tempered,

38
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:49,604
He neither fears death,

39
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,082
Nor rushes foolishly to meet it.

40
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,707
But to be a Cimmerian Warrior,

41
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:58,211
You must have both cunning and balance;

42
00:05:58,246 --> 00:06:00,623
as well as speed and strength.

43
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:08,460
Conan?

44
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:12,114
I gave you chores boy.

45
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:13,115
- I've finished, father.

46
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:23,212
The first to circle the hills
and return the egg unbroken;

47
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,888
Earns the right to fight with the warriors.

48
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:42,337
Oh...boy,  What are you waiting for?!

49
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,607
We go back!

50
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:25,277
Conan!

51
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:11,812
Make way..make way!

52
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:26,746
Come, It's time to forge you a blade.

53
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,518
The sword we make,
will be yours one day.

54
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:05,879
But, before you wield it,

55
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,822
You must understand it.

56
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,904
The sword must bend or it will break.

57
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:16,996
It must be tempered.

58
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:27,336
What is most important,
when forging a blade?

59
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:28,684
Fire or Ice?

60
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,270
- Fire.

61
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:34,961
- Ice?

62
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:35,962
- Are you certain?

63
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:50,982
Fire and Ice.

64
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:51,983
Together...

65
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:56,228
This is the mystery of steel

66
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,839
No! Slow down.

67
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Find your footing.

68
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:33,311
Enough!

69
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:48,287
You're not ready for this sword.

70
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,730
Fire!

71
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:24,903
Conan!

72
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:46,791
Father!

73
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:13,114
Khalar Singh: Barbarian?

74
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,891
There's no shame in kneeling before me.

75
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,582
Each of these brave warriors...

76
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,305
has surrendered half their lands;

77
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:35,306
Sworned..allegiance to me.

78
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:41,311
They do so, because they knew...
One day, I will be a GOD.

79
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:42,680
- One day...

80
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:49,338
The other clans of Cimmerian will gather for vengeance.
And then, God Or No God...

81
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:51,959
You will fall.

82
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:01,091
- You know why I am here.

83
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:04,741
One piece is missing, from the mask.

84
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:06,940
You know it's power.

85
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:07,941
Give it to me now!

86
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:18,498
--or die.
Then, I'll find it for myself.

87
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:24,648
- I prefer death.

88
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:14,021
This is your son?

89
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:18,052
I like him.

90
00:20:56,938 --> 00:20:59,488
Come here, my daughter.

91
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:05,220
Father..

92
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:07,633
I sensed the last scharp is close.

93
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,305
- Will you find it for me, Marique?

94
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,496
Barbarian, your son has courage.

95
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,874
But my daughter,
has talens as well.

96
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:22,875
Find it, Marique!

97
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:25,050
This Cimmerians...

98
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,051
they do not pray.

99
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,052
This is their church.

100
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:30,038
This is what they worship!

101
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,490
It will be here!

102
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:12,230
The Charred!

103
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:14,287
She found the bone charred.

104
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,365
Your mother would be proud.

105
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:41,302
Remo!
Gather the men.

106
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,103
Burn everything!

107
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:46,462
No, not the boy!

108
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:47,463
Not yet.

109
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,790
- Look what he did to my face!

110
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,291
Now...

111
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:56,338
How do I punish you, huh!?

112
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,057
Feeling of pain or death...

113
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,103
Worst then death, eh? Cimmarian,

114
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,491
Watching your son die.

115
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,521
Because he loves you.

116
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,491
It is complete.

117
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:15,657
Marique?

118
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:18,096
We are half way there.

119
00:24:18,097 --> 00:24:19,097
When we find the pure blood...

120
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:21,873
Your mother,

121
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:22,874
My beloved...

122
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:26,241
Will return!

123
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:34,255
The Mask, is complete!

124
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:52,373
Conan.

125
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:55,154
You cannot save me.

126
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:03,935
Let go of the chain, boy.

127
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,289
- I'm not afraid to die!

128
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,290
- It's alright.

129
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:16,824
- I love you son.

130
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:24,010
Noo!

131
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:38,106
<i>" Conan left Cimmeria..</i>

132
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:40,607
<i>And wandered the edges of the world."</i>

133
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:41,608
<i>" Slaying...</i>

134
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:42,609
<i>Thieving...</i>

135
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,610
<i>Surviving."</i>

136
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,442
<i>" Storming the high walls of Vanerium,</i>

137
00:26:47,443 --> 00:26:50,702
<i>and prowling the dark seas among pirates."</i>

138
00:26:50,703 --> 00:26:54,370
<i>" But the nameless man, who slaughtered his village.</i>

139
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:56,416
<i>and killed his father,</i>

140
00:26:56,451 --> 00:26:58,727
<i>remained in shadow."</i>

141
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:16,589
He is a common slaver, Conan.

142
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:17,908
Not the man you seek.

143
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:18,909
Why is that?

144
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:20,860
- No man should live in chains.

145
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,028
Stay and fight!

146
00:28:29,063 --> 00:28:31,471
You pig bellied, motherless..Goat lovers!

147
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:00,094
Go! You are free.

148
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,829
Go..your masters are dead.

149
00:29:07,306 --> 00:29:08,540
You're no longer slaves.

150
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:13,019
- But, you've taken all our foods.
All our weapons.

151
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,717
- Where would you have us go.

152
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,174
- We sail to Messantia!

153
00:29:54,997 --> 00:29:56,271
C'mon, old man!

154
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:15,171
I win!

155
00:30:22,162 --> 00:30:23,459
I still win.

156
00:30:28,723 --> 00:30:30,755
- When I first met him...

157
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:32,089
He was no bigger than,

158
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:35,794
just a scrawny little rat.

159
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:38,225
Picking pockets as a moron.

160
00:30:38,226 --> 00:30:39,226
Even so,

161
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:41,937
It was he...

162
00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:45,110
Who stole the elephant's heart!

163
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,207
And threw the sorcerer, Yarrah!

164
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:01,345
We need more mead.

165
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:18,928
Guards!
There...

166
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:21,103
Check there.

167
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:56,575
Hey!
Why are they looking for you?

168
00:31:56,576 --> 00:31:57,576
- No, no..no...no!

169
00:31:57,777 --> 00:32:00,393
No, wait! You don't understand.

170
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:05,895
They will take us both to the prison.

171
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:10,991
- Maybe, I want to go to prison.

172
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,853
You take the one in the middle.

173
00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:15,035
- Me?
- You!

174
00:32:15,036 --> 00:32:16,036
- I'll take him.

175
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:19,806
Run little man.

176
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:33,238
I am your prisoner.

177
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:11,286
Where is the captain?

178
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:13,618
- hmmm..ahh!

179
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:14,970
The hill ape can speak.

180
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,134
The captain is currently occupied.

181
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,739
- Don't worry, everyone can get their chance.

182
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,322
- Where the hell is the captain?

183
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:08,297
- ...He can only open it for me.

184
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:01,124
- Who are you?

185
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,397
- I’m the one who made you pretty.

186
00:35:08,394 --> 00:35:09,460
- You can't do this!

187
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:10,677
You know who I am???

188
00:35:27,966 --> 00:35:30,932
Where is the man, who killed my father?

189
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:33,401
- You speaking of the king?

190
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:41,154
No.

191
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,003
- My people were slain by a common bandit.

192
00:35:44,004 --> 00:35:45,004
Not a king.

193
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:47,755
- He was a bandit then,
He's a legend now.

194
00:35:47,756 --> 00:35:49,350
A shadow lord!

195
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:54,092
- A shadow lord..huh?

196
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:56,809
Speak.

197
00:35:57,987 --> 00:35:59,193
- I will not kill you.

198
00:36:00,736 --> 00:36:05,016
- You know the forbidden forest...
- Nothing there but dead, bodies and the animals who feed on em.

199
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,585
- He's heading there as we speak.
???

200
00:36:11,193 --> 00:36:13,382
- More.
- Not good enough.

201
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:15,050
- Wait!

202
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:16,846
- The forest is large, I know.

203
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:20,347
But that's where he turned to his stronghold,
The Gorcalva.

204
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:23,464
He returns by the way of the Ravina Charboad.

205
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:25,042
- That a big place for an ambush.

206
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:26,043
- What's he looking for, out there?

207
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:28,649
- He's with his Witch daughter.

208
00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:31,509
They're searching for a  young girl...

209
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:33,424
A pure blood.

210
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,063
- Are you leading me into a trap?

211
00:36:35,064 --> 00:36:37,651
- No, I would not lead you.

212
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:38,652
His mad!

213
00:36:40,306 --> 00:36:42,427
He's obsessed with Assyrian sorcery,

214
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:44,643
I hold no loyalty to him.

215
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:49,016
Well, Northerner...

216
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:51,377
I've upheld my part of the deal.

217
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,103
What are you doing!!?

218
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:12,428
- Toasting, to our deal.

219
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:27,910
Wait for me.

220
00:37:31,674 --> 00:37:33,234
Prisoners of Messantia!

221
00:37:33,235 --> 00:37:35,659
The key to your freedom!

222
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,731
Sits in your captain's gut.

223
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:39,398
- You gave me your word!

224
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:41,815
You swore you will spare my life!

225
00:37:41,816 --> 00:37:44,057
- I said, I will not kill you.

226
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:48,330
Free yourselfs.

227
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:03,153
My name is Ela-Shan.

228
00:38:03,642 --> 00:38:06,474
Brother, there's no lock I cannot break or fort I cannot enter.

229
00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:16,951
Ask anyone you meet ther for, Ela-Shan!!!

230
00:38:33,183 --> 00:38:34,942
What do you see?
Why don't you speak, Fassir?

231
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:37,405
- It is unclear.

232
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:40,703
I see a journey.

233
00:38:43,478 --> 00:38:44,762
A man.

234
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:51,094
- A knight?

235
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:55,133
- A warrior.

236
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:59,160
From a path, he'll emerge.

237
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:04,550
It will take you home, to your birthplace.

238
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:15,322
- Is that all that you see, Master?

239
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,741
The pure blood is close..

240
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,183
I can taste her in the air.

241
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:04,114
There will be rioting in Messantia,

242
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:05,115
For days...

243
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:06,116
Thanks to you.

244
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:08,527
- Khalar Singh.

245
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:11,106
- What?

246
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:13,147
- That's the name of the man, who killed my father.

247
00:40:16,043 --> 00:40:17,072
- Do you know who that is?

248
00:40:18,178 --> 00:40:20,328
I am told, he's the angel of death.

249
00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:23,506
- I'll leave tonight..
to Shapur outpost.

250
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:26,781
- We can sail as far as the bay,
near the Shapur outpost.

251
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:29,292
- Then, you wait for me there.
- Wait?

252
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:31,334
- I'm not your servant maid.

253
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:32,335
I will go with you.

254
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:34,438
- Not this time, Artus.

255
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:37,065
This is something, I must do alone.

256
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:47,898
Go to the temple!
Go, go.

257
00:41:57,341 --> 00:41:59,987
Go, go!

258
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:30,301
Come with me.

259
00:42:41,107 --> 00:42:43,571
- Get into the Carriage.
- No, we must stay here, and defend our home.

260
00:42:43,572 --> 00:42:45,896
- For the sake of your people,
you must leave this place and go to ..??

261
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,864
Do not hesitate and do not wait.

262
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:54,238
- I don't want to leave you.
- Do you trust me, Tamara?

263
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:56,967
- Yes, with my life, everything I have.

264
00:42:56,968 --> 00:42:59,501
- Then, ask no more questions and do as I say.

265
00:44:27,551 --> 00:44:28,177
- Where is Khalar?

266
00:44:30,841 --> 00:44:31,984
- Who is Khalar?

267
00:46:50,038 --> 00:46:51,706
Step aside, Northerner.

268
00:46:51,707 --> 00:46:54,256
The woman is property of Khalar Singh.

269
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:55,877
- She's my property now.

270
00:46:56,706 --> 00:46:59,278
- Oh, You have no claim to her.

271
00:46:59,694 --> 00:47:01,681
- No, but I have a claim to you.

272
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,933
- And what claim is that?

273
00:47:04,737 --> 00:47:07,788
- Death!

274
00:47:20,824 --> 00:47:21,930
Who are you?

275
00:47:25,914 --> 00:47:27,071
- When you fight a Cimmerian,

276
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:28,072
Even a boy.

277
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:31,715
You best kill him.

278
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,390
- I've killed hundreds of Cimmerian.

279
00:47:34,122 --> 00:47:36,868
- Yes, an entire village.

280
00:47:39,535 --> 00:47:43,259
???

281
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,035
Run from me...

282
00:47:46,036 --> 00:47:47,036
And I will tear apart the moment I find you.

283
00:47:50,002 --> 00:47:54,037
And I will follow you to hell.

284
00:48:02,024 --> 00:48:04,785
Woman!
Come here.

285
00:48:06,376 --> 00:48:08,987
I said, come here.

286
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:17,961
Which one of you...is the pure blood?

287
00:48:21,825 --> 00:48:23,324
Who ever reveals her...

288
00:48:23,325 --> 00:48:25,439
Gets to live.

289
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:42,526
And you smell...

290
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:48,843
Are you?

291
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,176
The one I seek.

292
00:48:52,856 --> 00:48:54,341
Could it be you?

293
00:49:12,557 --> 00:49:14,225
None of them, are here!

294
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:32,709
You know, who I've come for.

295
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,556
Why suffer for it?

296
00:49:38,452 --> 00:49:40,859
- None of the ancient bloodline remain.

297
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:42,059
- If that is true...

298
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:48,940
Tell me, why have you and this monks,
chosen to hide here, like vermins for thousand years?

299
00:49:49,242 --> 00:49:51,042
- We live here, in peace.

300
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:52,889
We have no rituals.

301
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,342
We do not make war.

302
00:49:55,343 --> 00:49:57,933
We value..life.

303
00:49:58,503 --> 00:50:01,766
- You value life.

304
00:50:03,651 --> 00:50:06,964
You forget what happened, in the forest of Ophea?

305
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:12,552
When all the nations of Hyborea,
hunted a woman, as if she were an animal??

306
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:17,477
When both I and my daughter, were forced to watch...

307
00:50:17,478 --> 00:50:22,866
My leige and innocent wife,
being lashed to rear and set aflame!

308
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,313
HUH!!!?

309
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:35,854
No, what you value is dead.

310
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:41,557
- Monsier, I had no part in her dead.

311
00:50:44,012 --> 00:50:48,535
- Where's the pure blood?

312
00:50:58,022 --> 00:50:59,960
- Not to fear, father.

313
00:51:00,468 --> 00:51:02,251
He will tell me his secret.

314
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:05,433
They all tell me the secrets!

315
00:51:08,056 --> 00:51:11,257
- Your vain pursuit for the secrets of Achelon,

316
00:51:11,258 --> 00:51:14,180
Is a  lust for power!

317
00:51:14,215 --> 00:51:15,279
Oh, for love of life...

318
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,017
Your...'innnocent wife'?

319
00:51:19,018 --> 00:51:21,910
Sought to enslave all of Hyborea,

320
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:23,841
With her Sorcery.

321
00:51:24,098 --> 00:51:27,164
She, deserved to burn!

322
00:51:29,682 --> 00:51:35,190
You..will never rule.

323
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:39,068
And the evil, will never rise again!

324
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:56,206
My Lord,

325
00:51:56,207 --> 00:51:59,235
Remo was searching for the one that got away.

326
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:04,810
- She is the pure blood.

327
00:52:06,181 --> 00:52:08,637
Remo will capture her for me.

328
00:52:37,027 --> 00:52:40,321
Get off.

329
00:52:43,948 --> 00:52:45,816
My master said we'd meet you.

330
00:52:49,282 --> 00:52:52,199
He said our path will emerge.

331
00:52:55,484 --> 00:52:57,923
- You're the one Khalar Zym seeks?

332
00:52:58,994 --> 00:53:00,230
- I know nothing, about it.

333
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:01,738
- Those were his men, chasing you.

334
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:03,808
- They attacked our monestary.

335
00:53:08,174 --> 00:53:09,009
- So,

336
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,633
Will you escort me to Hyricanea?

337
00:53:15,928 --> 00:53:18,457
- We willl wait for Khalar.

338
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:19,458
- We?

339
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:20,997
There is no 'we'.

340
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:23,541
I will go to Hyricanea, as my master instructed.

341
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:26,431
- I said...

342
00:53:26,432 --> 00:53:27,432
We will wait.

343
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,585
- I said, I will go to Hyricanea.

344
00:53:37,332 --> 00:53:39,088
- Why must I be tied up?

345
00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:41,402
- Keep quite, and do as you're told.

346
00:53:41,716 --> 00:53:42,682
- What are you going to do with him?

347
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,494
- I will wait for him to awaken,

348
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:54,829
...I might as well kill him.

349
00:53:57,591 --> 00:53:58,353
- Do you have a name?

350
00:53:58,354 --> 00:54:02,225
- My name is Tamara Amelia Jhorvi Karushan.

351
00:54:05,323 --> 00:54:08,174
- And yours is?
- Conan.

352
00:54:08,931 --> 00:54:10,728
- Conan. That's it?

353
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:14,061
- How many names do i need?

354
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:25,364
- Why would you save me,
Only to tie me up?

355
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,532
....???

356
00:54:32,992 --> 00:54:34,295
If I possess you..

357
00:54:34,296 --> 00:54:35,296
He must come to me.

358
00:54:36,546 --> 00:54:37,239
- Possess?

359
00:54:38,813 --> 00:54:40,024
I am not your property.

360
00:54:40,025 --> 00:54:41,025
- Go to sleep.

361
00:54:41,026 --> 00:54:42,872
- I take no instruction from no man.

362
00:54:42,907 --> 00:54:45,002
I'm a monk.

363
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:47,036
Of the order of Shairpur.

364
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:49,855
My people have never been ....anyone who..

365
00:54:55,016 --> 00:54:56,081
What?

366
00:54:57,392 --> 00:54:59,042
- Be quite!

367
00:55:13,217 --> 00:55:17,028
Still no word of Remo, and his scouts?

368
00:55:18,677 --> 00:55:23,257
- Remo will bring her here.

369
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:26,019
He has never disappointed me.

370
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:31,381
- The prize is near, father.

371
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:34,672
Soon, you'll have not only the mask...

372
00:55:34,673 --> 00:55:35,673
But the blood to fill it.

373
00:55:39,297 --> 00:55:42,939
I recount, how your mother yearned..

374
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,478
For the sorcery of Achelon.

375
00:55:47,906 --> 00:55:52,084
Imagine, the secrets
she'll bring back from the realm of the dead.

376
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:55,189
Imagine...

377
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,229
How indominable I will become,

378
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,841
When she's once again by my side.

379
00:56:02,885 --> 00:56:05,424
- Father?

380
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,275
If the girl is lost...

381
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:09,681
or the rituals fail???

382
00:56:11,029 --> 00:56:14,047
- It will not fail.

383
00:56:15,566 --> 00:56:17,309
- If it does?

384
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:18,310
- It will not!

385
00:56:20,848 --> 00:56:22,777
Your mother will return to me.

386
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:26,284
- My powers...

387
00:56:27,824 --> 00:56:29,407
are growing, inside of me.

388
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:34,319
My mother's blood flows through me.

389
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:39,303
I can help you, uncover
the secrets of Achelon,

390
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:40,935
Just as she did.

391
00:56:40,936 --> 00:56:44,300
I can have them all, kneeling before you.

392
00:56:45,442 --> 00:56:48,136
Just as I kneel before you now.

393
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:53,994
- My Marique...

394
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:54,995
You are like your mother.

395
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:59,985
In so many ways.

396
00:57:07,683 --> 00:57:10,895
But you're not her.

397
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,604
Here...drink.

398
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:23,887
The truth this time...

399
00:57:23,888 --> 00:57:26,139
Why does Khalar wants you?

400
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,500
- I'm a simple monk.

401
00:57:27,501 --> 00:57:28,501
I am of no value to a Warlord.

402
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:33,289
Remo: She's lying!

403
00:57:34,787 --> 00:57:35,738
Its her blood.

404
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:36,739
Her blood is special.

405
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,987
She's last of the bloodline of Achelon.

406
00:57:40,553 --> 00:57:41,745
- Wait?

407
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,120
Don't kill him yet.

408
00:57:49,268 --> 00:57:49,922
You are mistaken.

409
00:57:51,518 --> 00:57:53,227
That bloodline ended a thousand years ago.

410
00:57:53,228 --> 00:57:54,228
- You lying whore!

411
00:57:56,404 --> 00:57:56,953
- You can kill him now.

412
00:57:58,335 --> 00:57:59,847
- No, please!

413
00:58:00,934 --> 00:58:02,909
For her, I can get you a king's ransom.

414
00:58:03,265 --> 00:58:04,309
It is true.

415
00:58:05,101 --> 00:58:08,659
Khalar has been searching for a pureblood decendent
for twenty years.

416
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,336
- Then, we will wait for Khalar.

417
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:14,254
He will not come this way.

418
00:58:14,255 --> 00:58:16,852
He will be in Shaipurabin, waiting for me.

419
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,966
I can show you.

420
00:59:04,283 --> 00:59:06,963
See, I speak the truth.

421
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:08,982
If you want...

422
00:59:08,983 --> 00:59:10,716
He will give you, your weight in gold.

423
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:11,717
For this woman.

424
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:14,195
I will arrange everything!

425
00:59:14,196 --> 00:59:16,859
I will deliver the message.

426
00:59:17,326 --> 00:59:19,350
- Yes you will.

427
01:00:03,379 --> 01:00:07,026
Remo returns.

428
01:00:17,149 --> 01:00:21,472
- What does it say?

429
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:23,542
- The Shaipura outpost,

430
01:00:23,543 --> 01:00:25,219
Mid day..

431
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,993
come alone.

432
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,418
It's hers.

433
01:01:26,999 --> 01:01:31,688
You're bold, Northerner.

434
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:33,557
I admire courage,

435
01:01:33,558 --> 01:01:34,558
even when it's foolish.

436
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:42,072
Your reward...

437
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,100
- I do not want your gold.

438
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:45,101
- No?

439
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,166
Then, what?

440
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:50,089
- I want your head.

441
01:01:50,944 --> 01:01:55,035
- Yes, of course. You do.

442
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:56,827
Kill him..

443
01:01:58,179 --> 01:01:59,909
Then bring me the pure blood.

444
01:05:30,563 --> 01:05:32,366
- Who are you?

445
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:35,763
- You left me behind, to watch my father die.

446
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:44,416
Cimmerian.

447
01:05:47,024 --> 01:05:49,972
That was your chance, boy.

448
01:05:50,582 --> 01:05:53,058
You won't get another.

449
01:05:56,504 --> 01:05:59,450
Wouldn't your father be ashamed of you?

450
01:07:09,457 --> 01:07:12,337
C'mon!

451
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:04,388
Jump!

452
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:46,899
I had him.

453
01:08:52,945 --> 01:08:54,486
I had him.

454
01:08:55,336 --> 01:08:56,522
- The Gods are cruel.

455
01:08:56,523 --> 01:08:57,523
- Bless the Gods,

456
01:08:58,928 --> 01:09:00,522
This was not their doing.

457
01:09:03,131 --> 01:09:04,610
- How does his eyes feel?

458
01:09:06,365 --> 01:09:07,845
Are the tales they tell true?

459
01:09:08,447 --> 01:09:10,504
Does he have eyes, red as fire?

460
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:12,854
And the hide, of golden scales?

461
01:09:13,202 --> 01:09:14,834
- He is just a man.

462
01:09:14,835 --> 01:09:15,835
- Then, it is he..who has failed.

463
01:09:17,748 --> 01:09:19,037
In fact...

464
01:09:19,038 --> 01:09:21,707
You may be the only man in Hyborea.

465
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:23,272
To fight Khalar Zym.

466
01:09:23,384 --> 01:09:24,648
and live.

467
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:25,649
I need to go ashore and find her.

468
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:30,642
After I go,

469
01:09:30,643 --> 01:09:32,859
you must take her some place safe.

470
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,963
She saved my life.

471
01:09:38,298 --> 01:09:39,989
For that she has my loyalty.

472
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:43,268
- Then, she has mine as well.

473
01:10:02,425 --> 01:10:04,581
- Charming man, your friend.

474
01:10:04,582 --> 01:10:06,574
- Most man are born to Mother's milk.

475
01:10:06,934 --> 01:10:09,704
His first taste, was of his mother's blood.

476
01:10:10,452 --> 01:10:11,799
He was battle born.

477
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,800
- So, all he can do is kill?

478
01:10:15,181 --> 01:10:16,127
Oh no..

479
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,128
- He has the heart of a King.

480
01:10:19,252 --> 01:10:21,253
The loyalty of a bloodhound.

481
01:10:22,007 --> 01:10:23,814
Barbarians maybe warriors..

482
01:10:23,815 --> 01:10:26,654
But they do not sacrifice their children,

483
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,302
or enslave their allies,

484
01:10:28,303 --> 01:10:31,306
like the priest and princess of the civilised world.

485
01:10:32,163 --> 01:10:33,773
As for his manners...?

486
01:10:33,774 --> 01:10:34,774
- You look like a harlot.

487
01:10:35,584 --> 01:10:36,456
- Yes,

488
01:10:36,457 --> 01:10:39,159
and apparently,
i'm the only one you've ever met..who isn't one.

489
01:10:43,709 --> 01:10:47,821
- Cimmerian women dress as warriors.

490
01:10:48,147 --> 01:10:50,355
Give her the leather and the armour.

491
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:54,617
I think he likes you.

492
01:11:28,922 --> 01:11:32,067
Wake up!

493
01:12:46,418 --> 01:12:48,668
How many Cimmerians died at this edge of blade..

494
01:13:09,849 --> 01:13:12,051
Not bad.

495
01:14:20,579 --> 01:14:22,388
- Farewell, good friend.

496
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:26,339
- May you find, what you seek, Conan.

497
01:14:50,146 --> 01:14:51,051
It would seem,

498
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:53,948
our friend has forgotten his map of the shore line.

499
01:14:54,627 --> 01:14:55,866
You should take it to him.

500
01:14:56,899 --> 01:14:58,099
And say, goodbye.

501
01:14:59,832 --> 01:15:01,515
<i>©© Subtitle By D3xt3r ©©</i>

502
01:15:02,942 --> 01:15:04,909
We set sail at dawn.

503
01:15:06,186 --> 01:15:07,281
Don't be late.

504
01:15:12,838 --> 01:15:14,394
You should go back to the ship.

505
01:15:14,395 --> 01:15:16,135
- Have you ever wonder,

506
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:17,136
if our actions serves some plan...

507
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,788
Some purpose..

508
01:15:21,789 --> 01:15:22,789
One by the Gods?

509
01:15:24,651 --> 01:15:26,835
- Are we all just doomed to chaos and ruin?

510
01:15:29,623 --> 01:15:31,053
- I know not. and I care not.

511
01:15:33,269 --> 01:15:34,894
- I live...I love

512
01:15:34,895 --> 01:15:35,895
and slay.

513
01:15:37,069 --> 01:15:38,494
And I am content.

514
01:16:52,055 --> 01:16:57,694
Goodbye.

515
01:17:38,564 --> 01:17:41,082
Conan!

516
01:18:24,642 --> 01:18:26,316
Ah...the elusive one.

517
01:18:26,317 --> 01:18:27,317
Welcome!

518
01:18:28,097 --> 01:18:29,333
- You have made a mistake.

519
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:32,444
I am not the person, you are looking for.

520
01:18:43,395 --> 01:18:45,888
It is she.

521
01:18:46,405 --> 01:18:49,720
The pure blood decendent.
The Nacromancers of Achelon.

522
01:19:40,703 --> 01:19:41,959
- I'm looking for a thieve.

523
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,960
- ...is city of thieves.

524
01:19:45,589 --> 01:19:47,477
- I'm looking for a thieve named Ela-Shan.

525
01:19:48,571 --> 01:19:50,545
- Who are you, to ask?

526
01:19:50,546 --> 01:19:51,546
Barbarian.

527
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:58,116
Stand down fools!

528
01:20:03,578 --> 01:20:06,151
Fast as ...?
He will gut you like a fish.

529
01:20:09,801 --> 01:20:12,471
- I owe this man my life.

530
01:20:13,464 --> 01:20:15,252
- Well, Ela-Shan...

531
01:20:15,253 --> 01:20:16,253
You have your chance to repay it.

532
01:20:18,336 --> 01:20:19,482
Come.

533
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:39,538
This is madness.

534
01:20:39,539 --> 01:20:44,140
Breaking into Khalar Zym's fortress is like
reaching under a sleeping dragon to steal her eggs.

535
01:20:44,175 --> 01:20:45,478
Why go in?

536
01:20:46,378 --> 01:20:49,448
- There's a woman inside.

537
01:20:52,206 --> 01:20:55,270
- She must be really pretty.

538
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:13,665
My mother wore this gown on her wedding day.

539
01:21:14,549 --> 01:21:16,751
It flatters you.

540
01:21:17,527 --> 01:21:19,888
- I am not your mother.

541
01:21:21,646 --> 01:21:22,483
- No.

542
01:21:22,484 --> 01:21:24,333
but you will be.

543
01:21:25,078 --> 01:21:27,791
Imagine that your body is a vassel.

544
01:21:27,964 --> 01:21:30,138
And your soul is the water that fills it.

545
01:21:30,954 --> 01:21:33,338
When your blood seeds the mask...

546
01:21:33,339 --> 01:21:34,339
My father will empty you.

547
01:21:35,538 --> 01:21:37,506
- Then, I welcome death.

548
01:21:37,881 --> 01:21:38,883
- Your dead,

549
01:21:38,884 --> 01:21:42,107
shall herald a new age of Achelon.

550
01:21:42,987 --> 01:21:47,340
The spirits I raise will melt flesh from the bones of Kings.

551
01:21:47,732 --> 01:21:49,435
And my wife will make me a God!

552
01:21:49,436 --> 01:21:53,453
And we will cast all rivals into oceans of blood.

553
01:22:00,463 --> 01:22:02,381
Please, I beg you one last time.

554
01:22:02,382 --> 01:22:03,382
Do not do this.

555
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:06,965
Let us turn back.

556
01:22:10,074 --> 01:22:13,313
Come on.

557
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,771
Did you know, I met your barbarian...

558
01:22:26,772 --> 01:22:27,772
When he was a boy?

559
01:22:28,937 --> 01:22:31,659
That I took his sword from him.

560
01:22:32,298 --> 01:22:36,338
I'm told, Cimmerians steel is sharper and harder than any other.

561
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,401
That when it cuts,

562
01:22:39,402 --> 01:22:41,750
The pain is close to pleasure.

563
01:22:44,018 --> 01:22:46,552
I know that will please you.

564
01:22:57,781 --> 01:22:59,034
I told you, you see?

565
01:22:59,035 --> 01:23:00,035
I told you I can get you in.

566
01:23:53,169 --> 01:23:54,926
A feast for my sword.

567
01:23:54,927 --> 01:23:58,675
No, a feast for the Nuara!

568
01:24:17,388 --> 01:24:20,572
Watch out!

569
01:24:43,085 --> 01:24:46,188
Conan...

570
01:25:31,373 --> 01:25:32,681
Get me out of here!

571
01:25:32,682 --> 01:25:33,682
- Use the key.
- I can't. I dropped it!

572
01:25:33,683 --> 01:25:35,750
Then, pick the lock!

573
01:25:35,785 --> 01:25:36,812
With what?

574
01:27:11,996 --> 01:27:12,914
You scream like a woman.

575
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:39,768
I think he headed to that Scor Cave,

576
01:27:40,609 --> 01:27:43,916
- I see no more lucks down there.

577
01:27:44,285 --> 01:27:45,471
- Your debt is paid.

578
01:27:48,316 --> 01:27:50,538
Go on, then.

579
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:54,074
If you ever need me again,

580
01:27:54,075 --> 01:27:55,075
You know where to find me.

581
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:04,560
As Victorius Barbarian's shattered the mask.

582
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:08,937
So, shall it vanquished
if barbarian sword's should survive it.

583
01:30:11,515 --> 01:30:13,498
Pure blood!

584
01:30:30,326 --> 01:30:32,435
Behold!

585
01:30:33,248 --> 01:30:35,403
In despair...

586
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:39,323
Your new Master!

587
01:30:53,511 --> 01:30:56,747
My Queen!
Hear my call.

588
01:31:30,927 --> 01:31:32,054
Conan.

589
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:25,477
Barbarian, I don't like you anymore.

590
01:33:17,482 --> 01:33:19,422
This was your chance, Khalar.

591
01:33:19,423 --> 01:33:20,423
You won't get another.

592
01:33:59,373 --> 01:34:04,535
I smell you.

593
01:34:23,907 --> 01:34:26,101
Conan!

594
01:34:43,519 --> 01:34:44,799
Barbarian!

595
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,022
You're too late!

596
01:34:47,655 --> 01:34:49,608
She belongs to me!

597
01:35:44,471 --> 01:35:47,178
Die!

598
01:36:26,361 --> 01:36:30,940
I'm going to kill you,
with your own father's blade!

599
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:44,313
You're not wielding my father's sword.

600
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:59,166
Come on.

601
01:38:28,613 --> 01:38:29,946
Barbarian!

602
01:38:31,846 --> 01:38:33,413
I am coming for you!

603
01:39:07,834 --> 01:39:10,672
I summon you here.

604
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:19,005
His witch has possessed me.

605
01:39:19,006 --> 01:39:20,006
I can't fight her.

606
01:39:23,096 --> 01:39:24,497
Drop me Conan, please.

607
01:39:24,945 --> 01:39:26,489
- Once again,

608
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:31,302
The little Cimmerian is caught, holding a chain.

609
01:39:35,559 --> 01:39:37,631
Let me go!

610
01:39:41,368 --> 01:39:42,292
Boy...

611
01:39:42,293 --> 01:39:45,656
There's no shame in kneeling before me.

612
01:39:48,371 --> 01:39:49,997
She wouldn't live forever.

613
01:39:50,174 --> 01:39:51,370
Let go of the chain.

614
01:39:53,037 --> 01:39:54,587
Let go of the chain, Conan.

615
01:39:54,622 --> 01:39:57,387
- And let another die in your place?

616
01:39:58,554 --> 01:40:00,291
Like your father.

617
01:40:01,937 --> 01:40:03,205
Drop me!

618
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:04,476
- I warned him...

619
01:40:04,477 --> 01:40:07,070
That one day,

620
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:09,963
I will become a God!

621
01:40:17,339 --> 01:40:18,561
And my father warned you...

622
01:40:20,152 --> 01:40:21,199
God or not.

623
01:40:24,039 --> 01:40:25,061
Let me go!

624
01:40:25,062 --> 01:40:26,062
- You will fall!

625
01:42:11,567 --> 01:42:12,611
Thank you for bringing me home.

626
01:42:13,531 --> 01:42:14,897
- I know you have to leave.

627
01:42:14,898 --> 01:42:15,898
- Live well, Tamara.

628
01:42:17,168 --> 01:42:19,820
Until, we meet again.

629
01:43:39,021 --> 01:43:41,739
<i>" The sword we make, will be your one day ".</i>

630
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,737
<i>" Before you wield it,</i>

631
01:43:46,151 --> 01:43:48,013
