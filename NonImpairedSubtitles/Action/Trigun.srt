1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:39,100
 

2
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,192
Hey, Vash!

3
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:43,738
 

4
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:47,401
Now everything linking
you and Rem is gone.

5
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:47,676
 

6
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:50,338
Is that...
Is that your excuse?!

7
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:50,779
 

8
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:54,078
What have you learned
these past 100 years?

9
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:54,115
 

10
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:57,380
The scars carved into you
will never regenerate.

11
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,086
 

12
00:01:58,086 --> 00:02:00,884
You are living proof
of the folly of human trash.

13
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:00,922
 

14
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:04,358
You're wrong.
They're all alive.

15
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:04,392
 

16
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:05,381
Alive!

17
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:05,827
 

18
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:10,526
Why grow up if you only
grow more sentimental...?

19
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:10,565
 

20
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:14,433
...you good-for-nothing
weepy-faced kid!

21
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:31,519
 

22
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,419
W-What's this light?

23
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,657
 

24
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:38,626
It's something
you and I can do.

25
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:38,660
 

26
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,152
Now, let's dispose
of all the trash.

27
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:53,541
 

28
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,236
Are you going
to shoot me again?

29
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:58,179
 

30
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,977
Are you really going
to shoot me again...

31
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:01,016
 

32
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:02,244
...Vash?!!!

33
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:08,690
 

34
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,681
Eriks?

35
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:12,160
 

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,391
How long are you going to
to stay in bed? Get up!

37
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:15,430
 

38
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,092
Eriks!

39
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:38,787
 

40
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:40,118
Let me on!

41
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:40,155
 

42
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:42,953
At least take me
to the next town!

43
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:43,224
 

44
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,919
I have money! Let me on!

45
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,160
 

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,153
He might try to take the town
while we stand here arguing!

47
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:49,497
 

48
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,727
But you need
a ticket to ride...

49
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:51,766
 

50
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,234
Don't you get it yet?!

51
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:54,536
 

52
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:56,663
Just name your price!

53
00:03:56,663 --> 00:04:01,476
 

54
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:03,273
Wait, don't go!!

55
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:03,311
 

56
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,505
Let us on!!

57
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,181
 

58
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,672
There's a lot of tension
in this town.

59
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:08,917
 

60
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:12,216
I haven't seen you before.
Did you come in on that bus?

61
00:04:12,216 --> 00:04:12,554
 

62
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:14,954
- That's right.
- You have my sympathy.

63
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:15,156
 

64
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:17,681
You will never leave this town.

65
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:22,931
 

66
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:26,128
This town is under
siege by bandits.

67
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:26,167
 

68
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:27,964
Not only that...

69
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:28,002
 

70
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,971
...they say Vash the Stampede
is running the show.

71
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:31,506
 

72
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:36,967
The sheriff went to negotiate, but
came back doubled his weight in lead.

73
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:37,011
 

74
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:40,970
Once you walk into this town,
you're here for good.

75
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,449
 

76
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,545
The legendary gunman,
huh? Is that true?

77
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:45,587
 

78
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:47,214
Don't ask me.

79
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:47,255
 

80
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:49,450
The man who incinerated
two of the seven cities...

81
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:49,491
 

82
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:53,154
...designated as mankind's
first localized Act of God.

83
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:53,194
 

84
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:55,788
Some even say he put
that hole in the moon...

85
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:55,830
 

86
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,025
...but you'd have to be
crazy to believe that.

87
00:04:58,025 --> 00:04:58,633
 

88
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,124
Setting the thing
about the legend aside...

89
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:01,169
 

90
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,002
...this town needs help, bad.

91
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:04,572
 

92
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,870
By the way, what is that?

93
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,908
 

94
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:08,842
I'm a traveling priest.

95
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:08,877
 

96
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:10,504
I'm glad you're here.

97
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:10,912
 

98
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:13,608
We don't need anything formal,
just help with the funerals.

99
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:13,648
 

100
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:17,015
They took out our chaplain
a short while back.

101
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:22,457
 

102
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:23,754
Hey...

103
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:23,792
 

104
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:25,589
...what's the big idea?!

105
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:25,627
 

106
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:27,254
Oh, it's only Lina.

107
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:27,595
 

108
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:30,894
I'm not "only" Lina!!
Let go of me, Eriks!

109
00:05:30,894 --> 00:05:31,166
 

110
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,066
What's the big hurry, Lina?

111
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:33,101
 

112
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,399
I'm sorry, bartender...
Will you hide me?

113
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:35,436
 

114
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,131
What did you do?

115
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:37,172
 

116
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:39,163
She doesn't know
when to quit!

117
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:39,474
 

118
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:41,374
He was just poking
a little fun...

119
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:41,409
 

120
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,707
That pedophile
had it coming to him!

121
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:43,745
 

122
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:46,179
I mean, just because
he fondled her butt...

123
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,049
 

124
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,983
Keep your mouth shut!

125
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:50,018
 

126
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,680
Does that mean...?
No, surely not...

127
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:52,954
 

128
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:57,414
I'm afraid so. I don't think
they saw me come in here, but...

129
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:57,725
 

130
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,955
Hey, that's not funny!

131
00:05:59,955 --> 00:05:59,994
 

132
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:01,928
If what she says is true...

133
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:10,405
 

134
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,464
Give me back my lunch!

135
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:13,808
 

136
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,799
Where is the little girl...

137
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:15,844
 

138
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:19,940
...who struck my lovely face
with her heel?!

139
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,315
 

140
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,408
It was more like
an entire foot.

141
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:22,450
 

142
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,280
Quiet, you!

143
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,785
 

144
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:27,551
I see. That is a fine print.
The kid's got talent.

145
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:27,856
 

146
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:31,417
This man claims he saw
her enter this bar!

147
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:31,459
 

148
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,860
If he's wrong, I'll wring his neck
here and now for his trouble!

149
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:34,896
 

150
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:39,060
In any event, it will
be settled in 3 seconds!

151
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,400

160
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:54,081
Wait a second!

162
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:58,909
Oh, hey! We're really sorry
you didn't find it funny.

164
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:02,286
She's only a little 12 year-old.
Come on, have a heart.

165
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:08,129

Send out the kid.

After all, you look
like you wanna kill her.

173
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:17,338
 

174
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:20,830
I won't ask for a free favor.
If I do this...

175
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,644
 

176
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:25,374
...will you let her off?

177
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:25,613
 

178
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,841
Eriks...

179
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:27,982
 

180
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:30,348
That's not good enough.

181
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:30,852
 

182
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:35,812
Since you're on all fours,
you could at least act like a dog...

183
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:35,857
 

184
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:37,620
...buck-naked, of course!

185
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,432
 

186
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:47,424
Do you mean that?
Keep your word.

187
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:49,871
 

188
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:51,964
You don't have to do that!!

189
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:52,006
 

190
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:53,803
Don't do it, Eriks!

191
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:53,841
 

192
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,832
Eriks!!

193
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:57,345
 

194
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:58,903
Eriks...

195
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:09,991
 

196
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:12,323
It's not your fault, sweetie.

197
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:12,360
 

198
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,692
It's what he wanted.

199
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:14,729
 

200
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,196
But I...

201
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:16,230
 

202
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,198
That's just how it is.

203
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:25,640
 

204
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,770
Thank you for the entertainment!
I'll leave you a big, fat tip!

205
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:37,151
 

206
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:38,641
Let's go.

207
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:45,460
 

208
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,449
Shoot him.

209
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,630
 

210
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,427
ERI KS!!

211
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:53,835
 

212
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:55,234
What's all this?

213
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:55,570
 

214
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,731
He's been shot!
Please help him, doctor!!

215
00:08:57,731 --> 00:08:57,972
 

216
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:00,133
Eriks again? How many
times has he been here?

217
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:00,174
 

218
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,039
I can't tell if
the bullet's out!

219
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,076
 

220
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:06,536
If you had to choose between your life
and your pride, which would you choose?

221
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:06,581
 

222
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:10,039
I'd never be able to strip
and bark like a dog.

223
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,084
 

224
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,678
It's the perfect talent
for a wimp like Eriks!

225
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,689
 

226
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,988
Thanks to that "wimp,"
you ingrates are still alive!!

227
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:18,026
 

228
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:19,755
Eriks! Eriks!

229
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:19,794
 

230
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:21,455
Grandma!

231
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:21,963
 

232
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:23,225
Eriks...

233
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:23,264
 

234
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:26,722
It's all right, Grandma.
The bullet was out.

235
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:27,068
 

236
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,332
He's one lucky devil.

237
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:29,837
 

238
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:32,772
I don't know who this
legendary gunman thinks he is...

239
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:32,807
 

240
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:35,833
...but does he have the right
to steal what little family is left...

241
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:35,877
 

242
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:37,845
...to an old woman like me?!

243
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,047
 

244
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:40,810
God dammit!

245
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:40,848
 

246
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,372
Hey, ma'am!

247
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:42,550
 

248
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,142
Stop it! You're too old!

249
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:44,185
 

250
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:47,052
You won't last
two seconds against him!

251
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:47,088
 

252
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:51,354
Let me go! All right,
who will go in my place?!

253
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:52,527
 

254
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:55,325
See? You're all
a bunch of cowards.

255
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:55,363
 

256
00:09:55,363 --> 00:09:57,627
You're far too young
to order me around!!

257
00:09:57,627 --> 00:09:57,665
 

258
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,361
You're going to get
yourself killed, you old bat!

259
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:00,468
 

260
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:01,935
Shut up!

261
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:01,969
 

262
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,664
Stop it, Grandma!

263
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:03,704
 

264
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,696
- Lina...
- It's my fault.

265
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:06,741
 

266
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:10,370
If I had stayed away from them,
he wouldn't have...

267
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:10,545
 

268
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:11,978
...he wouldn't have...

269
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:12,013
 

270
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:16,541
At any rate, keep the noise down.
Other patients are trying to recover.

271
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:16,584
 

272
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:19,052
I'm so sorry, doctor...

273
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:19,087
 

274
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:24,457
No, I understand how you feel.
I'll have Eriks moved to the ward.

275
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:24,926
 

276
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:26,553
Thank you.

277
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:26,594
 

278
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:29,256
Let's go fetch him
a change of clothes, Lina.

279
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:29,297
 

280
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:30,889
Yeah.

281
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:33,468
 

282
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:35,663
Let's roll him into the ward.

283
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:36,170
 

284
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,197
What? You can leave, too.
He'll be all right now.

285
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:40,241
 

286
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,176
I know that.
I want to help.

287
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,447
 

288
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:47,675
How long are
you gonna sleep?

289
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:48,182
 

290
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:49,171
Wake up, you!

291
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:49,350
 

292
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,545
What are you doing
to my patient?!

293
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:52,720
 

294
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,415
Doctor, doctor!!

295
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:58,693
 

296
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:02,185
What's this?
Are you conscious already?

297
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:02,864
 

298
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:06,425
Sorry, doc. Could you leave
the room for a little while?

299
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:06,901
 

300
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:08,232
Sure.

301
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:08,269
 

302
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,601
Don't let him strain himself.

303
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:17,545
 

304
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:19,638
Long time, no see...

305
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:19,680
 

306
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,705
...Vash the Stampede.

307
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:35,329
 

308
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,695
I finally found you, you idiot.

309
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:37,732
 

310
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:40,633
What's a legendary guy like you
doing in a place like this?

311
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:40,668
 

312
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:45,662
Stop it. I could have destroyed
the planet with that gun.

313
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:47,008
 

314
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:51,206
There's a blank in my memory.
I can't explain what I did.

315
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:52,413
 

316
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:55,974
Maybe, but it was you,
wasn't it?

317
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:56,217
 

318
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,048
Yes, it was me.

319
00:11:58,048 --> 00:11:58,319
 

320
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:01,482
My fragmentary visions,
but more than anything...

321
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:02,123
 

322
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:04,819
...something inside tells me
I'm the one.

323
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:09,730
 

324
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,496
I'm the one who put
that hole in the 5th moon.

325
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:18,739
 

326
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,606
And you're so afraid
of what you can do...

327
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:21,642
 

328
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:24,543
...you're living
in easy retirement?

329
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,713
 

330
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:28,204
I only wanted
to live quietly...

331
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:28,249
 

332
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,184
...with a different name,
and a different way of life.

333
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:35,089
 

334
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,058
Why are you here?

335
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:38,092
 

336
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,185
Are you here to laugh at me?

337
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:40,228
 

338
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:42,253
I came to take you away.

339
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:42,296
 

340
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,024
To where?

341
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,065
 

342
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:46,226
If you're asking for
a final destination...

343
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:46,267
 

344
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,531
...I don't know. However...

345
00:12:48,531 --> 00:12:49,136
 

346
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:52,537
...I do know that I need your help.

347
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:52,773
 

348
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:57,039
I turned Augusta upside-down
looking for you.

349
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,182
 

350
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:04,208
Have you ever met
a guy named Marlon?

351
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:04,252
 

352
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:06,812
I mentioned I knew you,
and he fixed it for free.

353
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:08,456
 

354
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:11,391
Why? Why are you
giving me this?

355
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:11,425
 

356
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,325
I thought you'd need it.

357
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:18,432
 

358
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:22,391
I want... I want
to live my life here with them.

359
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:27,275
 

360
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:30,335
Why was he hospitalized
the last time?

361
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:30,811
 

362
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:35,339
He tried to stop a violent drunk
at the bar and got punched himself.

363
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:35,983
 

364
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,349
And the time before that?

365
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:38,386
 

366
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:40,547
He fell off a thomas.

367
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:41,922
 

368
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,356
You be sure to thank him!

369
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,326
 

370
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,920
Yeah... I know.

371
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,200
 

372
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,134
<i>Are you okay? </i>

373
00:13:55,134 --> 00:14:02,310
 

374
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,642
<i>You're in horrible shape! </i>

375
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:05,246
 

376
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:09,376
<i>You poor thing... </i>
<i>You must have been through a lot. </i>

377
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:09,884
 

378
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:12,546
<i>It's okay... </i>
<i>You'll be safe here. </i>

379
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:20,094
 

380
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:21,925
So you're staying, huh?

381
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:22,897
 

382
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:25,559
Whenever I step in,
people die.

383
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,168
 

384
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:29,432
All right.

385
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:32,273
 

386
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:37,210
If you want it bad enough
to give up everything else...

387
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,244
 

388
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,711
...then go for it.

389
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:43,651
 

390
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:44,879
Say...

391
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:44,919
 

392
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,910
...are you familiar with
a town called Carcases?

393
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,123
 

394
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:52,354
It's a tiny town
in Southern Cornelia.

395
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:52,393
 

396
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:56,352
Something strange happened
there six months ago.

397
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:56,397
 

398
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:59,423
Its residents suddenly
disappeared without a trace.

399
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:00,134
 

400
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:03,433
Everything in the town
looked completely normal...

401
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:03,938
 

402
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:06,463
...only, the people
had vanished.

403
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:07,975
 

404
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,034
The cavalry went in
and combed the place over...

405
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:10,077
 

406
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,477
...but didn't find a soul.

407
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:13,514
 

408
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:17,416
One cavalryman, however,
did discover something odd...

409
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,286
 

410
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:24,280
...a man's name painted on
the monument in the town square.

411
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,325
 

412
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:26,725
It was in red,
and they say it read...

413
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:27,294
 

414
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,955
...Knives.

415
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:35,536
 

416
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,697
Knives.

417
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:43,210
 

418
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,204
Whenever I step in, Destiny homes in
on the smell of blood and gun smoke.

419
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:48,949
 

420
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,544
It only creates
mountains of debris.

421
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:55,489
 

422
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:56,478
<i>Vash... </i>

423
00:15:56,478 --> 00:15:57,691
 

424
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,988
<i>... take care of Knives! </i>

425
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:02,363
 

426
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:04,763
<i>Rem! Rem!! </i>

427
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:10,905
 

428
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:14,068
What should I do?

429
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:14,608
 

430
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,940
Your gun! Give me
your gun, hurry!!

431
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:16,977
 

432
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,945
What is it, Gramma Sheryl?

433
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:18,979
 

434
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,412
They've got Lina!

435
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:20,448
 

436
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:21,938
- What?!
- Give it here, quick!

437
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:21,982
 

438
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,610
Wait, Sheryl!
Don't throw your life away!

439
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:24,652
 

440
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:26,313
She's probably dead by now!

441
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:26,353
 

442
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,514
Don't argue,
just give me your gun!!!

443
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:28,556
 

444
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,046
Grandma! Grandma, wait!!

445
00:16:30,046 --> 00:17:02,022
 

446
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,786
You know, I...

447
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:04,825
 

448
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:08,818
...really was fond
of my life here.

449
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:09,430
 

450
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,193
Them's the breaks.

451
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:11,232
 

452
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:15,066
Someone's gotta get tough
or someone else is gonna cry.

453
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,904
 

454
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:18,428
They're both gone!

455
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:18,472
 

456
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:22,340
" Please don't look for us.
We're going to get Lina back."

457
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,143
 

458
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,043
All by themselves?!

459
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:28,182
 

460
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:29,649
How many are there?

461
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:29,683
 

462
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,082
About 200.

463
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:31,118
 

464
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:34,383
100 each, huh?
That's a shame...

465
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:39,093
 

466
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:41,152
H-Hey, don't kill anyone!

467
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:41,428
 

468
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,396
Don't ask the impossible!!

469
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:43,430
 

470
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,159
Thou Shalt Not Kill!

471
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:45,266
 

472
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:48,258
What the hell kind of
a churchman are you?!

473
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:49,436
 

474
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,165
Stop saying the same thing.

475
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:51,605
 

476
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:53,664
You're sounding
like your old self!

477
00:17:53,664 --> 00:18:01,248
 

478
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,681
Eriks!

479
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:07,121
 

480
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:09,112
Slaughter 'em!!

481
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:19,900
 

482
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,958
Let's do it.

483
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:46,460
 

484
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,395
I must have been
out of my mind...

485
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:49,430
 

486
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,490
...to talk to someone
so filthy-looking.

487
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,972
 

488
00:18:57,972 --> 00:19:02,966
Hey, did the two of them take care
of all these thugs by themselves?

489
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:03,677
 

490
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:08,512
I've never seen anyone
kick so much ass in my life.

491
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:12,820
 

492
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,788
<i>So your mind is made up? </i>

493
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:15,322
 

494
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,621
<i>Yeah. I think I will go... </i>

495
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:18,659
 

496
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,127
<i>... although I hate to</i>
<i>do this to you and Lina. </i>

497
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:21,161
 

498
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,619
<i>Isn't there anything we can do? </i>

499
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:24,665
 

500
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,792
<i>Tell me all about it. </i>

501
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:27,568
 

502
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,058
<i>Thank you... </i>

503
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:29,103
 

504
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:32,800
<i>... but I can't. If I did, </i>
<i>you would be put in danger. </i>

505
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,040
 

506
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,534
<i>We know you're going to wind up</i>
<i>alone in another alley somewhere. </i>

507
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:38,045
 

508
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:41,537
<i>That hurts us the most</i>
<i>about your leaving. </i>

509
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:42,616
 

510
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,311
<i>I'm sorry. </i>

511
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:44,918
 

512
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:49,514
Who would have guessed that Eriks
was actually Vash the Stampede?

513
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:49,556
 

514
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:50,921
Tell me about it!

515
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:51,158
 

516
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:55,595
And to think, all this time
we thought pig-man here was Vash!

517
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:56,196
 

518
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,859
Hey, do you think he plans
to stay on in this town?

519
00:19:59,859 --> 00:19:59,900
 

520
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,164
Don't even go there!

521
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:02,202
 

522
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,193
Yeah! We ought to
run him out right now!

523
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:17,518
 

524
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:18,951
I see...

525
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:18,986
 

526
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:24,618
...she cried, huh?
Maybe I was a little too pushy.

527
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:24,658
 

528
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,523
You hardly need apologize.

529
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:26,560
 

530
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,996
Mr. Preacher, please
take good care of our Eriks.

531
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:30,030
 

532
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,989
Unlike you, he's a bumbling
fool of a goody-goody.

533
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:34,768
 

534
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:39,262
Lina and I realized
somewhere in our hearts...

535
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:40,574
 

536
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:45,068
...we knew that Eriks would
probably leave us someday.

537
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:46,180
 

538
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,742
But that doesn't change the fact that
we're losing a member of the family.

539
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:51,652
 

540
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:54,746
Please don't forget that.

541
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:56,657
 

542
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:57,749
I'm sorry.

543
00:20:57,749 --> 00:20:58,392
 

544
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:01,259
I'm truly sorry, Grandmother.

545
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:24,585
 

546
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:25,984
There.

547
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:26,019
 

548
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,987
All done.

549
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:37,331
 

550
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:39,265
Lina...

551
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:43,937
 

552
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:45,928
Thank you.

553
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:47,608
 

554
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:50,076
I wanted to keep you safe...

555
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,178
 

556
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:53,271
...but it turned out
the other way around.

557
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:53,313
 

558
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,407
I was too weak.

559
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:57,985
 

560
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,976
Don't be stupid.

561
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:01,288
 

562
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:04,018
Thank you.
I'm sorry.

563
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:04,892
 

564
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:07,520
Those are both my lines.

565
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:25,379
 

566
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:27,370
<i>Lina... </i>

567
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:27,848
 

568
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,941
<i>... thank you. </i>

569
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:29,983
 

570
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:33,384
<i>And goodbye, for now. </i>
