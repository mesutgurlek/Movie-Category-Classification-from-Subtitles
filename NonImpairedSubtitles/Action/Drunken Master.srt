You should wear more clothes and take care

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,557
Don't always make me anxious

7
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,912
I understand

8
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,717
Brother,i'll go look after the horses.

9
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,596
Isn't Bull down there taking care of them?

10
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,238
Brother,these goods are very important
It's good to be a bit more careful

11
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,237

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,239
Thank you ,brother Bao

18
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,754
I'll go back to my room

19
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,789
Master Wen Bao?

20
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,553
Mr.Robinson told me to give this to you

21
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,914
Don't mess up

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,274
No problem

23
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,755
Ok.

24
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,269
Pal,may I...

25
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,271
My name's Hong Yihu.
Please stop.

26
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,794
You are the four-move-in-one-hard-monkey wen biao?

27
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,279
An agent?

28
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,829
Yes.I was sent here from Nanjing -

29
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,512
- investigating opium smuggles in Guangdong Province.

30
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,238
But my identity was exposed,
and I was chased

31
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,715
So i planned to borrow a horse from you
to ride back to Nanjing

32
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,755
Borrow a horse?

33
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,954
I am an agent

34
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,635

35
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,199
Take it

36
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,515
Thank you.

37
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,398
Brother, - that horse is mine

38
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,595

39
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,788

40
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,712
Master Wen.see you around

41
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,598
Stay away! We are ZhenYuan Escort!

42
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,833
ZhenYuan Escort?

43
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,512
Boss, ignore that name.

44
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,790
Let's kill them...

45
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,233
Shut up!

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,075
ZhenYuan Escort is tough.

47
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,275
Boss...

48
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,759

49
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,910

63
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,148
Boss Yu.

64
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,028
Boss,put it inside.

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,549

66
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,918

67
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,432

See you next time.

70
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,272
Wen Biao, thank you for your hard work.

71
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,235
Boss, that's my job.

72
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,839
Wen Bao?

73
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,668
Everything all right?

74
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,718
...Right

75
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,271
Tipple!

76
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,270
Yeah!

77
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,753
Toast!

78
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,195
Good job!

79
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,032
You know the goods are important
and you lost them?

80
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,430
Boss, it's out of expecting.

81
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,873
Out of expecting?

82
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,795
Listen..

83
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,039
If there are more out-of-expecting-thing...

84
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,758
You,and I,will lose everything in ZhenYuan Escort!

85
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,954
Boss,

86
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,311
The agent took my horse

87
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,670
he's only got the material evidence
but no witness.

88
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,832
And the rather that he's in Nanjing
while we are in Guangdong.

89
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,954
He can't do anything to us

90
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,915
Then how can you explain to Robinson?

91
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,914
We can make amends

92
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,479
Maybe a bit more than what he lost,
never mind.

93
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,034
You thought amend is enough?

94
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,556
Don't worry,boss.
I'll handle it.

95
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,392
I'll handle it.

96
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,553
Never let your brother know this.

97
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,272
Morning.

98
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,192
Master Wen,

99
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,670
Wen Bao, you smoke opium?

100
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,150
Brother, don't misunderstand.

101
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,191
These are for the guests.

102
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,755
Brother!

103
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,833
Wen Bao,

104
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,556
We go through fire and water together.

105
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,752
I know you.

106
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,919
From you were a kid,till now.

107
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,997
I always protect you,and spoil you.

108
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,440
But that doesn't mean you can do bad things

109
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,079
Do you understand?

110
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,788
Brother

111
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,952
I heard you've been in brothel and gambling house

112
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,238
You are just an escort

113
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,432
How can you afford that?

114
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,189
Brother, you got to believe me.

115
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,073
What you heard was nonsenses

116
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,392
You smuggle.

117
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,996
I didn't!

118
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,150
No?Then what's this?

119
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,396
I found on your horse.

120
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,713
You smuggle opium under the name of ZhenYuan Escort?!

121
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,393
Bother,I...

122
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,676
Follow me to the police,and give yourself up.

123
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,872
No! Brother! Don't take me there!

124
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,915
Please, let me go.

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,629
- No way!
- Brother!

126
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,439
Don't!

127

Please let him go this time

128
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,752
For us,for the family...

129
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,115
No!
Wen is a family of indomitable spirit.

130
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,395
I shall never let him ruin the family's reputation
Go!

131
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,357

136
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,472
Let me embrace her,

137
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,158
Brother..

138
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,992
Please take care of there two children for me.

139
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,639
Brother, children can't live without their father.

140
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,799
Come on,tell brother that
you won't do this any more.

141
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,595
Brother,I won't do this, no more.

142
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,829
Hold!

143
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,875
Prepare!

144
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,071
Wen Biao,go see what happens.

145
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,036
OK

146
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,675

Let me go

148
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,597
Wen Bao,be careful

149
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,789
I know

150
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,949
Wen Bao!

151
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,873
Wen Bao!

152
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,713
Wen Bao!

153
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,274
Wen Bao!

154
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,714
Wen Bao, why are you doing this?

155
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,876
Brother,I don't want to
spend my whole lifetime being just an escort

156
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,678
I don't want to be look down upon

157
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,837
All this times, however good I did...

158
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,353
I am always the little brother of Wen Biao

159
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,954
I am nothing but your brother!
I want to be outstanding! I want to be rich!

160
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,309
Boss

161
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,718
Why are you all staying here?

162
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,069
Wen Bao has rebelled.

163
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,354
I knew it.

164
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,952
You are with him!

165
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,988
Don't move

166
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,229
Why!?Why!?
Why you gang up to set me up!?

167
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,956
Yu Haiyang!

168
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,638

Yu Haiyang!

170
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,388
Throw him down to the river

171
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,313
Brother

172
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,278
Be in peace...

173
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:05,875
Your little brother,Wen Bao,
will definitely make a great tomb for you

174
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,433
Brother...

175
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,191
Wen Bao,you are so brutal

176
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,273
Smart your brother is,he fell in your trap.

177
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,352
Boss,you overpraised me.

178
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,199
Well done.

179
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,072
Nobody's gonna stop us now.

180
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,559
We can do whatever we wanted to.

181
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,470
You are the Vice now.

182
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,196
I don't want to be an escort all my life.

183
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,516
Can you handle Mr.Robinson?

184
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,592
Not a problem.

185
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,438
Damn you!

186
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,155
妈不像
Mom, unlike!

187
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,390
Son?
Unlike what? What unlike?

188
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,879
I told you unlike!

189
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,951
What unlike?

190
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,268
Whatever unlike!

191
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,073
But he act much like monkey just now.

192
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,193
He open his legs too much to be like a monkey

193
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,239
Give it to me.

194
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,072
Here you are!

195
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,795
Stay back

196
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,830
Mom, don't act like a play.

197
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,869
Close them

198
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,959
Close them

199
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,153
Monkey Steps On Cloud!
(Name of a move in Monkey Boxing)

200
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,789
Step…

201
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,719
Monkey Peepee!

202
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,393
Monley's 18 somersault!

203
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,073
No.1 somersault...
No.2 somersault...
No.3 somersault!

204
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,476
Mom,stop turning if can't hold

205
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,239
Alright.
Monkey's free exercise!

206
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,150
Got it!

207
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,588
Monkey on the ground!

208
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,469
Monkey's flat peach!

209
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,276
Monkey eyes right!

210
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,839
Monkey eyes left

211
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,835
Draw!

212
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,271
That's not like a monkey!

213
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,593
Monkey looks to the moon!

214
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,959
Monkey rolls up the cloud!

215
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,233
Monkey throws pins!

216
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,671
That's it! Go on!

217
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,918
Could you get me some new stuff?

218
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,869
OK

219
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,151
猴子探海
Monkey explores ocean!

220
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,519
A bit higher

221
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,671
Higher

222
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,398
I can't hold!

223
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,239
Draw your hand back!

224
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,629
- Headstanding monkey boxing!
- Keep on drawing,son.

225
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,789
Act more like a monkey!

226
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,396
Up!

227
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,428
Monkey gives a stretch!

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,829

Monkey climbs hill!

230
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,870
Climb...Faster

Come on draw,son!

232
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,076
Master's so good!

233
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,309
No more move left!

234
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,318
Here,and there

235
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,435
OK

236
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,830
Climb…

237
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,717
夫人老爷回来了
Ma'am,old master's back.

238
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,028
Go away.

239
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,469
Old master is back!

240
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,069
What? Dad is back?

241
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,035
Hurry tidy up!

242
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,034
Quickly!

243
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,869
Don't let go!

244
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,991
Suchl a mess

245
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,514
Take the ladder away!

246
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,400
Close the door! Drag in the curtain!
Hurry!

247
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,153
- Master,you are back.
- Yes

248
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,598
Master why so early this time?

249
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,915
I finished my business,
and I was concerned about you.

250
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,479
So I decided to be back a bit early.

251
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,873
Lovely!

252
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,076
I bought this for you in Shanghai.

253
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,353
Where's Jiaye?

254
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,232
Master?

255
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,595
Isn't it lovely?

256
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,193
Yes,it is.

257
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,391
What are Jiaye doing there?

258
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,793
He's reading

259
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,393
Reading?

260
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,392
Okay...stop playing

261
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,993
Where the hell is Jiaye?

262
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,312
In there.

263
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,309
Master

264
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,994
Master

265
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,877
- Nephew..
- Uncle...

266
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,478
Quickly

267
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,430
I have been hoping you study hard
then carry on the family's property

268
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,670
But look at you! You never study
but only paint your damn painting!

269
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,069
Dad, this is my work of Monkey Boxing!

270
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,350
Work?
Can you make a living with your work?

271
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,558
You did nothing!

272
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,029
Alway loafed and never did what you should do.

273
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,875
What you know is staying home
drawing monkeys!

274
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,473
Master,don't get angry.

275
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,074
Dad,listen to me.Don't be angry.

276
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,071
I'll soon finish my Monkey Boxing Book
There are only 8 moves left.

277
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,469
Kneel down!

278
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,151
At that time, everyone will know:
I ,Chan Jiaye,wrote a Monkey Boxing book all by myself!

279
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,549
Everyone will know: I,Chan Jiaye,
is the grand master of the time!

280
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,914
Don't...don't...don't you keep dreaming!

281
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,835
Today, I, as your father,
will teach you before all our forebears.

282
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,955
House-law staff!

283
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,268
Yes,master

284
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,879
Master!

285
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,708
Enough now?

286
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,758
Enough what?

287
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,351
This is my own family business

288
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,119
Mine too.

289
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,031
Yours,how could it be?

290
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,232
May I ask you a question...

291
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,509
how do you call me?

292
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,635
Uncle...

293
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,159
Then how do I call you?

294
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,239
I am your nephew...

295
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,035
Bring me the....

296
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,438
Clan Bible of Chan Family!

297
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,558
Listen,my nephew

298
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,590
On the first page of the bible...

299
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,355
there are words

300
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,913
like…Wan?

301
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,911
Wan Zai Qian Qiu

302
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,200
Wan Zai Qian Qiu Cheng Jia Xun,
Liu Fang Bai Shi Jiu Gong Ming.

303
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,231
The "Qiu" in my name Chan Qiu De...

304
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,790
...is right before the "Cheng" in your name -

305
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,711
- Chan Cheng Jin

306
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,919
Wow,It's all on the bible.

307
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,036
Kneel down

308
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,229
- My daughter-in-law?
- Yes?

309
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,833
How do you call me?

310
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,397
Master Uncle

311
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,753
Listen to me

312
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,876
Even if I suddenly pass away...

313
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,790
the position of my memorial tablet
will be a bit higher than yours.

314
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,950
Speaking of this...

315
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,553
in this room...

316
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,071
who is the family master?

317
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,759
Uncle

318
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,877
I can't hear you.Say it again.

319
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,076
Who is the family master?

320
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,949
Of course...You,my uncle.

321
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,673
RIght

322
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,911
I understand that
you were hoping Jiaye to carry on your business

323
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,399
But what's Jiaye's fault!?

324
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,038
You are always mad at him

325
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,390
His fault is painting all the time

326
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,791
Jiaye's only purpose
of publishing the Monkey Boxing Book...

327
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,991
is to finish his own wish

328
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,352
If you wouldn't let him continue his painting..

329
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,231
it'll contradict with your style

330
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,273
My what style?

331
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,916
Your "Carry things to the end" style

332
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,949
You might think I am wrong

333
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,873
in your head

334
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,879
I knew

335
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,474
You always look down on us kungfu people

336
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,399
My family was poor when I was a kid

337
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,594
My father and I counted on you.

338
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,188
I would never forget..

339
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,436
the help you've given us at that time.

340
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,751
Uncle...

341
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,398
But listen to this

342
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,634
Mr.Sun Yat-sen said that
Chinese Kungfu is the quintessence of our country

343
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,478
- Right!
- That's a good line!

344
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,597
Yeah!

345
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,433
I'll take care of Jiaye

346
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,431
I want him to finish the Monkey Boxing Book

347
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,238
And I want him to study hard

348
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,799
I want him to be versed in both civil and military affairs!

349
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,074
Great!

350
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,951
Draw Monkeys?
Can you draw monkeys any more?

351
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,434
I know how to Monkey Box!

352
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,799
Come,fight me!

353
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,712
Get out of my way.

354
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,595
Good shot!

355
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,518
The ball is used for slamdunk

356
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,835
but not for hitting people

357
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,275
Right

358
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,673
He boasted again...

359
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,035
Take it.

360
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,315
Are you interested in play against him?

361
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,038
Ok

362
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,474
You afraid?

363
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,833
Play?

364
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,679
All I know is to fight!

365
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,150
Grand-ncle,you are most good at it

366
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,239
Grand-ncle?

367
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,355
Why can't I see your mustache?

368
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,675
What?

369
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,432
No mustache no grand-uncle?

370
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,800
Could I be your dad if I got mustache?

371
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,431
If your sister marries my grandpa and has a child...

372
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,954
What does my son call your sister's son?

373
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,513
I'll tell him

374
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,874
Grand-uncle!

375
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,870
Why?

376
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,996
Grand-uncle!

377
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,639
How dare you play me around?

378
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,875
Teach them!

379
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,235
I am hungry, I am going home now.

380
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,234
Go on!

381
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,794
Let go!

382
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,357
Such a burden...

383
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,516
I wanna fight you, 1 vs 1. Afraid?

384
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,556
Come．

385
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,631
I told you I am hungry

386
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,998
Wanna fight? Come on.all of you!

387
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,752
I gotta catch supper,
so all of you,come on.

388
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,274
Come on,hit here.

389
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,828
- Hit or not?
- Of course hit him!

390
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,639
It pains me to death!

391
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,749
Smells bad..

392
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,709
So bad...

393
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,439
Father,our students really study hard

394
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,836
and like extracurricular activities  very much.

395
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,231
They are good at football,basketball,and more.

396
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,872
Especially the sword.

397
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,478
And they play baseball very well

398
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,030
We often form a team and participate in matches.

399
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,754
Why you learn Western sword instead of Chinese sword?

400
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,398
Such a foolish worship.

401
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,550
Father

402
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,317
We plan to build one more church
for students to confess when they have time.

403
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,758
There's no problem in outlay.

404
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,829
What are you doing!?

405
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,556
A 3-6-0-degree T O S H!

406
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,588
Nice strike!

407
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,549
Son

408
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,752
Did you hurt somewhere?Are you alright?

409
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,477
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine

410
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,675
Don't be anxious,mom.I am fine.

411
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,797
Uncle,you alright?

412
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,439
President,then who...?

413
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,953
Who got hurt?

414
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,312
It was me...
God bless you...Amen

415
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,151
Be gentle!

416
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,116
Who hurt you?

417
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,394
It was I.

418
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,679
Let me confess

419
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,435
Have you?

420
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,078
Just let me confess once.

421
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,634
I

422
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,399
With what?

423
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,279
A ball

424
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,714
A ball?

425
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,116
Nephew,I'll explain

426
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,033
I was not striking him,but was striking that ball.

427
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,719
It's the ball that struck him.

428
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,710
That's all.

429
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,472
i understand

430
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,910
Yes,logically

431
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,514
You injured Father Ma indirectly.

432
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,430
Right

433
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,479
That's called a fourbagger.

434
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,712
- It's a nice strike
- Nice strike?

435
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,633
You say that was a nice strike??

436
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,878
Could you just stop baating my son?

437
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,712
He won't learn nothing if I don't teach him!

438
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,870
I must  teach him a good lesson today

439
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,029
Mom!

440
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,472
"If you beat him any more,
I'll punish you myself."

441
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,630
Stop singing that...

442
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,517
"You are not allowed to enter bedroom tonight"

443
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,478
- Stop singing...
- "Stay in the lobby all alone"

444
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,318
Stop!

445
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,919
President

446
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,755
What's this?

447
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,791
What?

448
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,393
It's bad news

449
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,754
Bad news?

450
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,071
Should we be prepare for it?

451
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,032
Letter of Transfer

452
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,195
Transfer?

453
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,472
Tansfer to which famous school?

454
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,551
Goat City High School

455
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,479
Guangzhou?

456
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,151
So far away....

457
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,236
Morning

458
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,435
Morning

459
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,473
Thank you.

460
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,069
- Grand-uncle...
- Stop

461
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,399
You still call me Grand-uncle?

462
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,756
Didn't we make the deal
that we call each other brother?

463
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,273
You ate too many bananas?

464
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,960
OK...Brother De...

465
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,951
Why we must get off train and come to Shaoxing?

466
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,838
Could we find him?

467
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,071
Since we haven't yet started to find..

468
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,839
how could we find him?

469
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,036
Right...but...grand-uncle...

470
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,198
Brother De,I don't think
we can find him by searching just like this

471
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,272
Well,I think if we keep on searching...

472
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,910
we'll find him,sooner or later

473
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,193
Don't you want to finish your great work?

474
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,869
Of course I do.

475
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,279
That's right.

476
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,316
That's your style,grandson.

477
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,193
Better call me Jiaye,if you still remember our deal

478
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,236

Have you seen a people named Wen Biao

486
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,910
No.

487
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,353
Try to remember

488
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,674
I don't know.You can ask him.

489
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,353
- Doctor...
- Stretch your tongue

490
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,350
Doctor

491
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,351
Have you healed a monkey?

492
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,158
I am not a vet!

493
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,434

530
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,195
Don't run so fast

531
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,435
Stop following me,or I'll jump

532
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,314
Really?

533
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,515
Then I'll draw

534
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,069
Thank you,hero

535
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,592

00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,555
Don't you go!

538
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,835
Where are you going?

539
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,395
Stupid

Leave me alone,go find that girl!

542
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,998
Girl? Which one?

543
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,833
The girl in moon-white!
She plays Monkey Boxing very well!

Hurry! I want her to be my model!

546
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,915
- Hi,Fu

547
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,274
Yes

548
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,034
Nice bananas!

549
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,998

Sure!

552
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,277
What am I hiding from?

553
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,038
How could she know monkey boxing?

554
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,193
Hey you!

555
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,515
How does it smell?

556
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,116
Smells good!

557
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,838
Wanna give a try?

558
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,112
Good!Give me 2 jars!

559
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,189

560
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,039
Ger out of my way

561
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,439
Please

562
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,352
Follow the girl,hurry!

563
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,668
No,I got things to do

564
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,474
Still got things to do?

565
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,835
No more!

566
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,594
Don't get so close

567
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,835
Take this!

568
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,035
Bad

569
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,675
Bad?

570
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,553
What about drinking this way?

571
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,793
Never waste my good wine!

572
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,236
What? You said it was bad!

573
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,555
I was kidding

574
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,634
Hurt!

575
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,875
You old monkey!

576
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,156
You broke it!

577
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,555
Told you do not waste my wine...

578
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,756
It was you that broke it!

579
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,519
You can ward my kick off!

580
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,991
Like this

581
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,876
Like this

582
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,473
- And this
- This?

583
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,596
If you don't want to ward off,
you can parry like this

584
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,669
Look! Sway-- sway

585
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,719
Monkey stretches claw!

586
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,196
Ready?

587
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,713
Monkey's stretch!

588
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,795
Monkey runs!

589
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,592
Monkey ignores him!

590
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,749
Get in the house

591
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,274
Ghost!?

592
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,268
Don't approach!

593
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,032
- So cold...
- I know monkey boxing!

594
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,869
I am so cold

595
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,835
I'll perish together with you!

596
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,399
How dare you beat your grand-uncle?

597
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,835
Grand-uncle?

598
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,873
I am sorry

599
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,635
What happened to you?

600
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,800
"ZhenYuan Business"

601
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,389
You get out.

602
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,150
Is this place ZhenYuan Escort?

603
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,953
Get out!

604
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,629
I am here to return this horse.

605
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,675
Get out!

606
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,068
Rocky

607
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,708
He's our friend. Don't be rude

608
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,593
Please come inside

609
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,752
- Take the horse to stable.
- Yes sir

610
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,395
Please drink

611
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,353
Mr.Hong, my brother...
after he lent the horse to you that time

612
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,357
he walked into thoes caterans' trap
....and died.

613
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,957
Wen Biao's death was such a misery

614
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,389
Master Wen lost his life because I took the horse...

615
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,436
Mr.Hong,don't be so sad

616
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,237
Escorts like us...

617
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,190
are always preparing for risks

618
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,232
Why ZhenYuan Escort turns to this?

619
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,799
We don't want to lose more brothers

620
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,158
And I don't want Wen Bao to be sad

621
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,394
So I am doing business with foreigners

622
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,355
Turned Escort into Business office

623
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,672
One of my reasons here was returning the horse,

624
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,398
the other is that I wanted to see his
four-move-in-one hard monkey boxing

625
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,671
But...I never have this chance...

626
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,593
Come on show me.

627
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,669
No way

628
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,318
Was his kungfu as good as that girl?

629
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,436
- You play me around all day
- I didn't

630
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,715
Speaking of kungfu, they are both good.

631
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,631
How good?Come on tell

632
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,199
Don't hasten

633
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,509
What are you doing?

634
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,749
Look

635
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,232
He was acting like this..

636
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,999
I don't know what the hell you are doing

637
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,799
Hold this

638
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,628
Hold

639
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,628
Four-move-in-one?

640
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,517
Wow...

641
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,068
Kid,were you playing four-move-in-one?

642
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,708
Please tell me!

643
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,312
- You?
- None of your business.

644
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,239
Who's your teacher?

645
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,718
Why should I tell you?

646
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,512
Please tell me.

647
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,676
OK.My teacher is Master Wen Biao, so what?

648
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,074
- Don't you lie..
- Let go

649
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,878
Hard-monkey Wen Biao?

650
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,513
Where's he now?

651
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,358
I won't tell you

652
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,029
Wanna fight me?

653
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,229
Come

654
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,312
Come...

655
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,230
Kid,you haven't learned it long

656
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,909
Right?

657
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,635
You really are a hero

658
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,948
He's a newbie.

659
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,516
Please lead me to your master.

660
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,116
Master Wen Biao is hard to find

661
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,553
I'll tell you when I see him

662
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,995
Let's go

663
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,071
kid!

664
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,516
Put away the opium!
Put down the curtain

665
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,830
Sorry everyone,this will only take a few minutes

666
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,309
What happens?

667
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,873
That agent

668
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,875
What's  he doing here?

669
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,515
I don't know

670
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,513
But don't worry,I can handle this

671
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,757
- Be careful
- Yes

672
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,072
Boss Yu, I had fought Master Wen Biao before.

673
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,912
I know his four-move-in-one.

674
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,756
Obviously the kid hasn't learned it for a long time.

675
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,079
Very strange

676
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,553
There's no one else can play his four-move-in-one

677
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,908
But I saw it with my own eyes!

678
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,869
Mr.Hong

679
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,317
You mean my brother's still alive?

680
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,833
Yes?

681
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,515
When I asked the two kids

682
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,999
They just wouldn't tell me where Master Wen was.

683
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,072
So I came to you.

684
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,752
Should we do more investigation?

685
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,754
Alright.

686
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,513
Then please do so

687
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,919
And please inform us as soon as you see him

688
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,993
Ok,I'll leave now

689
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,074
Stop…

690
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,749
What?

691
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,149
I have a little suspect

692
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,029
was he the real Wen Biao?

693
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,799
I believe that he must be the real Wen Biao.

694
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,030
Or must be his relative.

695
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,192
This time,we must get him to be our teacher.

696
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,269
Of course

697
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,510
Or I won't be able to finish my book

698
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,516
And ... we got so many presents

699
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,635
He's absolutely gonna be touched

700
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,392
Yes,go!

701
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,518
Thank you guys!Good job!

702
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,839
What are you doing?

703
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,353
We want to have a teacher

704
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,794
What are these?

705
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,632
Presents for the teacher!

706
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,878
For me?

707
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,668
You?No way,

708
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,759
Then what do you come for?

709
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,958
Min, come in

710
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,870
Open the door…

711
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,229
You know them?

712
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,673
I met them downtown

713
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,873
You showed off again?

714
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,837
- No no no...
- No?

715
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,069
Tea, please, daddy

716
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,755
What can we do now?

717
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,397
Haven't you heard the story of Three Kingdoms?

718
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,558
Right!
We need to visit him repeatedly to make him trust us

719
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,834
Keep knocking

720
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,834
Should we kneel down?

721
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,274
Stupid

722
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,630
We don't need to kneel down until he opens the door

723
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,631
- Let them be
- Ok..

724
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,708
Please open…

725
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,475
One more thing!

726
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,028
A bad guy wants to find Wen Biao

727
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,995
Exactly

728
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:01,876
Who wants to find Wen Biao?

729
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,949
We don't know

730
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,078
That hero has saved my life

731
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,276
And he's good ar kungfu

732
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,948
What the hell are you talking about?

733
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,189
Please be our teacher!

734
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,991
Teacher? Get up.

735
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,389
Master Wen Biao,long time no see.

736
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,718
Hong Yihu?

737
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,352
You really are master Wen Biao?

738
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,678
Dear teacher!

739
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,671
My father stands aloof from the world out there
Leave him alone.

740
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,557
Master Wen,you stands aloof?

741
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,750
Then why did Wen Bao say you have died?

742
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,715
- Min
- Yes?

743
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,358
- Get these two kids out
- OK

744
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,437
Master Wen!

745
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,308
Get up,...
this way

746
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,594
- Take them,leave!
- Miss,listen to us!

747
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,477
- We are very sincere
- Go!

748
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,470
Go!

749
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:55,792
So...
ZhenYuan Escort has turned to today's Business Office

750
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,789
Whatever, none of my business

751
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,669
Wait!

752
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,434
I tell you two

753
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,516
Never ever come here again! Go!

754
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,074
What a pity.

755
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,750
I won't have chance to see your
four-move-in-one hard monkey boxing no more.

756
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,598
How could you just stand aloof?

757
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,188
They got to pay for what they've done to you

758
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,629
I don't want to think about thoes dark things before any more

759
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,839
Violence can't solve any problem...

760
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,197
So I stopped to keep us out of harm

761
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,950
Master Wen,you have great mind and skills

762
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,156
I am so happy to know you

763
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,673
It's worth my whole life.

764
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,869
Drink.

765
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,550
What?

766
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,828
Stop!

767
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,000
My arm...

768
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,556
Kids

769
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,638
They took Min away!

770
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,351
What happened?

771
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,158
Wen Bao has taken Min away

772
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,999
How are you doing,kid?

773
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,798
I am fine, go save her!

774
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,393
Min!

775
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,389
Min!

776
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,319
Min!

777
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:33,317
Min! Are you ok?

778
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,268
What happened to you? Wake up!

779
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,639
Min,answer me!

780
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,595
- Min!
- It's opium liquor!

781
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,713
How much has she drunk?

782
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,150
Not too many,only two bottles.

783
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,558
How could you do that to her..

784
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,199
Never mind.

785
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,192
Two bottles of opium liqour will kill her!

786
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,954
I know

787
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:15,110
People say Woman Snail can
sew and mend the sky by smelting stones

788
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,875
This little Woman Snail can ser and mend your kyte.

789
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,834
So you treat her like your own daughter

790
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,275
Wen Bao,you've done lots of evildoings

791
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,830
Colluding with the foreigners to smuggle opium,
you have offended the national law!

792
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,310
Right,I do smuggle opium

793
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,719
And what?

794
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,758
I am afraid of nothing,
because I have those foreigners be my backup

795
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:46,433
不过我心里还真的有点儿怕
But...I still fear ...

796
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,598
Mr.Agent

797
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,038
Would you please do me a favor?

798
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,554
What?

799
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,558
Kill him!

800
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,074
I am a law-executor,can't do so

801
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,959
Then I'll teach you how to do

802
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,798
You can see him as the escaped criminal of opium smuggle.

803
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,070
Nonsense!

804
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,434
Are you still human?

805
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,551
Even if I kill him,you won't let me go

806
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,719
Yes

807
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,150
Wen Bao

808
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,309
What do you want?

809
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,674
- Kill ,or not?
- Stop!

810
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,751
- Kill him!
- Don't!

811
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,637
- Don't!
- Min!

812
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,477
Wen Bao,no!

813
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,471
Min!

814
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,957
Wen Bao,what do you want?

815
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,792
Wen Bao,what are you doing?

816
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,313
Kill him!

817
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,796
Do it!

818
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,440
What are you waiting for!

819
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,999
Hurry!

820
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,555
No!

821
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,994
Wanna see me kill her after raping her first?

822
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:51,796
Wen Bao!

823
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,871
No!

824
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,518
No!

825
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,149
No!

826
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,468
Wen Bao,let her go!

827
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,476
You heard me, now do it!

828
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,836
Kill him!

829
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,638
Kill!

830
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,557
Why did you stopped? Kill him!

831
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,519
Tippling can stop the pain.

832
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,870
Drink this, and never quit!

833
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,198
Kill him!

834
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,594
Min,stay with me!

835
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,913
Take her away from here!

836
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:22,871
Hong Yihu!

837
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:23,949
Go!

838
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,079
Go!

839
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:43,358
I enjoy my death!
Which will honor the loyalty of our friendship!

840
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,997
Don't chase him, help me out first!

841
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,188
He refuses to eat again?

842
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,080
He hasn't had food for three days

843
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,638
How's that girl?

844
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,472
He doesn't allow me to see her

845
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,591
But at least you can see a little right?

846
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,598
I can't

847
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,031
You can't?
Can't you try other means?

848
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,313
Uncle,you haven't recovered yet

849
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,072
Never get excited

850
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,434
Mom, I am so much worried about Min

851
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,678
Me too

852
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,716
How's Master Wen?

853
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,233
I see

854
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,594
Take this away

855
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,952
But I have promised Master Wen

856
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,437
He said he would heal Min himself

857
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,512
and wanted us to leave him alone

858
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,554
Mom

859
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,112
But Master Wen himself needs to be looked after too!

860
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,519
I know

861
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,670
He's got old wounds!

862
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,633
Why not allow us to take care of him?

863
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,871
But you two wounded badly...

864
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,031
We...are young men!

865
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,828
Jiaye

866
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,148
Uncle!

867
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,959
Be quiet

868
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,189
OK

869
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,988
Min

870
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,989
Master Wen,

871
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,718
You should eat and rest

872
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,951
If you get ill,who will take care of Min?

873
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,069
Min..

874
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,912
Master Wen,wake up

875
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,831
Please eat something

876
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,275
Let us look after Min

877
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,432
You haven't recovered yet

878
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,476
- You need to take care
- Master Wen?

879
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,919
Master Wen

880
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,231
Mrs.Chan, you promised not bothering us

881
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,833
Leave us alone

882
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,270
Uncle,Jiaye,let's leave

883
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,236
Ma'am,master's back home.

884
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,311
Master,everything done?

885
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,389
All done

886
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,831
I buried Hong Yihu's body in the bamboo forest.

887
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,194
Don't worry about it.

888
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,873
Great

889
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,431
Master Wen, Mr.Hong Yihu was buried well

890
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:01,919
Don't worry any more

891
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,631
Master Wen,don't worry

892
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,954
I heard it

893
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,917
Mr.Chan,thank you for finishing my wish

894
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,716
I have a wish too

895
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,516
Master Wen,would you teach my Jiaye kungfu?

896
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,398
Please finish my son's wish to draw the monkey boxing book

897
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,674
Yeah!

898
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,157
Min, I want you to play monkey boxing for me

899
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,270
Wake up

900
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,636
Min,I want you to be my model

901
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,358
Right,Min

902
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,916
You know,your business is our business

903
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,391
Let's avenge Hong Yihu together

904
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,839
Hurry wake up!

905
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,751
You mean real?

906
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,957
Or how can we call her spirit back?

907
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,873
Grand-nephew...you must keep your words

908
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,837
Grand-uncle,I just talk the talk

909
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,553
Min's back!

910
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:25,072
Master Wen,Min's back!

911
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,354
Min!

912
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,598
Min,you are up

913
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,073
Min

914
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,755
Min,you are up.I didn't need to worry any more

915
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,479
Min

916
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,198
Old Monkey

917
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,552
So nice you wake up

918
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,319
"I enjoy my death!
Which will honor the loyalty of our friendship!"

919
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,431
"Go!"

920
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,590
Great! Master Wen!

921
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,398
你又收了两个好徒儿了
You have had two more good prentices!

922
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,230
Master

923
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,228
Please accept our worship!

924
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,433
Master Wen,
they will inherit your hard monkey boxing!

925
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,435
Mrs.Chan

926
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,835
First move!

927
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,838
Why not keep sleeping, Min?

928
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,956
Are you alright?

929
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,473
I want to keep exercising

930
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:34,510
Hurt...

931
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,475
Master Wen..

932
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,435
Could you let him take a break?

933
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,029
Take a break

934
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,832
Not you! Keep on!
Monkey presents a peach!

935
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,916
Every finger of Monkey must be powerful

936
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,078
Aren't them powerful?

937
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,511
Yeah...I'll go change my clothes

938
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,716
No way!

939
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,469
Keep on!

940
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,073
Monkey pulls!

941
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:38,710
Hold!

942
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,110
Your eyesight must be concentrated
when playing monkey boxing

943
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,599
You must lock your target with your eyesight

944
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,557
Suppose that is your enemy

945
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,274
He's our relative

946
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,429
Yes

947
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,313
I said suppose!

948
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,237
Every separated part of monkey
has the potential of intelligence

949
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,756
Master,I suppose you are my enemy

950
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,435
Right,but your fingers are not powerful!

951
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,194
Go on!

952
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,950
It's not enough using only arm and shoulder strength

953
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,508
Again

954
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,833
You should use waist strength

955
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,874
Three kinds of strength into one!

956
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,190
Nice drawing.

957
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,274
You are so good!

958
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,679
Yeah,sure

959
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,875
Go on!

960
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,229
Tipple -- can inprove your body strength and power

961
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,749
And your guts!

962
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,631
Hard monkey boxing plus tipple...

963
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,072
We can fight better

964
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,391
Drink this...

965
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,752
And never quit!

966
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,516
Wishing to be drunk all my lifetime and never wake up

967
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,516
Forget our sufferings and pains in the world!

968
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,630
Great!

969
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,910
Fight

970
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,396
Master

971
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,790
Fight

972
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,396
Fight me...

973
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,911
Fight...

974
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,514
Master!

975
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,990
I....never reget!

976
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,754
No good!

977
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,879
Master Wen, too bad this time!

978
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,271
Jiaye and Grand-uncle...they are gone

979
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,755
Wait

980
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,513
- Ahui?
- Yes?

981
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:37,589
Take them downstairs

982
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,669
See

983
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,593
Misters, please smoke

984
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,479
You two,go away

985
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,788
Yes sir.

986
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,712
Misters,may I know what do you want to consign?

987
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,872
A package of things

988
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,479
What things?

989
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,793
Right here

990
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,716
"To: Yu Haiyang, ZhenYuan Escort"?

991
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,713
Right

992
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,671
What's in this package?

993
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,790
All lethal things inside

994
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,799
are for Yu Haiyang and Wen Bao

995
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,709
Oh,you mean manager Yu.

996
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,995
He's in his office,I'll take it to him.

997
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,833
Quite near,we'll take it to him ourselves.

998
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,399
Needn't trouble you

999
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,795
Ok,I'll lead the way for you.

1000
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:53,749
Please

1001
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,309
Please,this way

1002
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:07,875
Come in,please

1003
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,878
You led us to this tunnel?

1004
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,471
Yu Haiyang and Wen Bao live in such a secret place?

1005
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,595
They must feel guilty all the time

1006
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,795
There will be traps

1007
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,838
We are tough, and never afraid

1008
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,389
Don't leak out

1009
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,030
Master said we should hide our spirits and powers inside

1010
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,912
Did he say this?

1011
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,157
What are you looking at?
Lead the way!

1012
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,559
Go!

1013
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,993
- Once you move left,I'll hit you on the right
- Once you move right,I'll hit you on the left

1014
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,072
- Once you move your head,I'll kick your ass
- Once you turn around,I'll cut your dick

1015
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,832
You must be thinking how to kill us.

1016
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,189
I really don't know what you are talking about

1017
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,713
We don't,either

1018
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,149
Follow me.
