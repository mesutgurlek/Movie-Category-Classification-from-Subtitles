1
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,850
Welcome to the world of OZ.

2
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,350
OZ is a virtual world
 that can be enjoyed

3
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,950
by people from all over the world.

4
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,800
You can easily access OZ through a personal
computer, cellular phone, or even your television.

5
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,050
Now, let's try experiencing
the world of OZ.

6
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,520
First, let's customize your avatar.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,100
Your avatar is your
virtual  self inside OZ.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You can choose your avatar's clothing,
hairstyle, and even give it a tail.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I see you've created
an  adorable avatar.

10
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,600
All your personal information
 will be safely managed

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,300
by our world-class security system,

12
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,400
so you can relax  and enjoy.

13
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,650
Inside the shopping mall you can
find music, movies, furniture,

14
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,710
food, cars, real estate,
 souvenirs and more

15
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,100
from all over the globe, 
just like in the real world.

16
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,010
If you wish to shop around
 more, try the Galleria.

17
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,380
World-famous brand name
stores can be found here,

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,710
and you can even buy items
to decorate your avatar.

19
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,350
But what's most necessary in
OZ is nothing other than...

20
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,350
Communication.

21
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,570
OZ supports instantaneous translation
services for every language in the world,

22
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,720
so you can enjoy conversation with anybody,
no matter where they might hail from.

23
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,500
There are currently 4 million
active communities in OZ.

24
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,950
Through your avatar,

25
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,210
you can also try your 
hand at various sports.

26
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,800
OZ supports a lively
business  environment as well,

27
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,620
and companies worldwide have
set up branches inside OZ.

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,610
You can open an  office here, too.

29
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,090
Furthermore, many administrative
bodies and local governments

30
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,300
can be dealt with  through OZ.

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,200
You can pay your taxes and take
care of various legal processes.

32
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,100
Finally, let us introduce 
the guardian spirits of OZ,

33
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,850
John and Yoko.

34
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,600
Welcome and  thank you for subscribing.

35
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,200
Now, it's time for you to start
an engaging life inside OZ.

36
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,260
Monday, July 26th,

37
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,900
Afternoon News.

38
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,650
This morning, the
planetary  probe "Arawashi"

39
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,400
moved from its orbit around
the Sun to circle the Earth.

40
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,450
Through Arawashi experienced
many problems during its journey,

41
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,650
the plans to send the
 solar sample capsule

42
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,520
gathered from the
planetoid  Matokawa to Earth

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,900
are proceeding as scheduled.

44
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,850
And now for our next item.

45
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,900
If I'd just tried a little harder
I could've represented Japan...

46
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,100
That again? Just give it a re–

47
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,200
Hey, part-timers!  Quit slacking!

48
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,450
Yessir.

49
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,950
But it's really a shame.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Oh, shove it.

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,700
Try and find  something else to do.

52
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
Let's think up something
to do for summer vacation.

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,350
Girls! C'mon, girls!

54
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,050
Watermelon, fireworks, and girls. That's
what comes to mind when you say summer, right?

55
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,650
Watermelon and fireworks
 are enough for me.

56
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,800
Don't be such a wimp.

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,900
I don't care either way.

58
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,900
Anybody up for a part-time job?

59
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,700
We're actually in the middle of one...

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,100
A job?

61
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,130
We're running additional
system maintenance on OZ.

62
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,950
On OZ? That's amazing!

63
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,350
No, no. We're just code
monkeys. It's nothing special.

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,650
I see, so you  were
already working... darn.

65
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,380
Isn't there  anyone who's free?

66
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,000
Umm, Natsuki-sempai! 
If you're okay with me...

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Really?

68
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,500
Hey, what about this?

69
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,450
Sorry, I don't think
I can do it after all.

70
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,700
No good, huh?

71
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,100
All you'd have to do is
follow me into the country...

72
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,700
Then I'll do it!

73
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,900
What the hell?

74
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,750
Then... me too!

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,050
But two's a bit much.

76
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,550
All I need is one.

77
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,000
<i>I'll take on anyone!</i>

78
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,500
<i>- When are you coming? 
- I'm getting on the train right now. Wait for me! Natsuki</i>

79
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,700
Ah, Kenji-kun!  Over here!

80
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,900
Sorry I'm late.

81
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,050
Nah, you're right on time.

82
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,100
Sakuma-kun  would've probably run late.

83
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,540
I'll do whatever  you want.

84
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:41,800
Thanks.

85
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,300
For now, I just want
you to carry my stuff.

86
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,100
We're going to Ueda in Nagano?

87
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,950
It's my Grandma's birthday party.

88
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,180
Relatives are coming 
from all over the country,

89
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,200
and we're really 
strapped for able bodies.

90
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,000
But anyway, what was that
about representing Japan?

91
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,000
I heard about it from Sakuma-kun.

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,300
He said you  almost made it.

93
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,600
What kind of contest was it?

94
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,480
A math Olympiad.

95
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,300
An Olympiad?  What's that?

96
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,290
So you're good at math, huh.

97
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,430
Umm, I guess.

98
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,900
Math is all I'm really  good at.

99
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,150
Calculate something.

100
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,570
Okay. Sempai,  when were you born?

101
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,850
Me? July 19th, 1992.

102
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,920
It was a Sunday.

103
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,600
July 19th, 1992  was a Sunday.

104
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,450
Did you memorize all that?

105
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,400
No.

106
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,800
It's something called modular
calculation, and... was I right?

107
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,350
Sorry.

108
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,450
I don't know what day it was.

109
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,900
Ueda, Ueda.

110
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,670
It's Grandma's  90th
birthday this year, so...

111
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,850
I see, she was born in 1920!
She's lived very long, hasn't she?

112
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,450
Natsuki-chan?

113
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,690
Natsuki-chan!

114
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,490
Noriko-obasan!

115
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,820
Long time no see!

116
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,150
She's the 16th  head
of the Jinnouchi clan.

117
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,150
The 16th?

118
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,750
There are even graves from all the way
back to the Muromachi era on our grounds.

119
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,750
The clan struck it  big trading in silk

120
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,100
during the Meiji era, 
but our late grandfather

121
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,800
practically burned  through
all that money and...

122
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,180
Yumi-san!

123
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,160
Natsuki-chan!

124
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,550
The country's changed so much!

125
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,550
Nothing's left from what we used to have. Not
the mountains, not the stores, not the factories.

126
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,480
But still, you should see the
letters that grandmother gets.

127
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,650
Nearly all of them are from company
presidents and famous politicians.

128
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,820
Natsuki-chan!

129
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,320
Nana-san!

130
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:02,100
You know, sometimes
grandmother gets really scary.

131
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,040
She's the daughter of
a warrior clan, see.

132
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,450
You'd better  watch out.

133
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,850
What is this place?

134
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,090
You must all be tired
from the journey here, hmm?

135
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,320
Come, there's ice-cold
watermelon inside.

136
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,530
I love watermelon!

137
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,700
Let's go!  Hurry!

138
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,720
Uhh, congratulations  on
your ninetieth birthday.

139
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,370
It's my mother's birthday, actually...

140
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,430
- Kenji-kun!
 - Right!

141
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,800
Sorry to spring this on you suddenly,

142
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,000
but try to humor Grandma no
matter what she says, okay?

143
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,230
Humor her?

144
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,700
Mother?

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,320
Come in.

146
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,490
Grandma!

147
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,600
- So you've come. 
- It's been so long!

148
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,240
Are you feeling all right?

149
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,780
As you can see, I'm doing fine.

150
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,850
They said you were feeling weak...

151
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,770
It was just the heat.  Don't worry.

152
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,150
I'm so relieved.

153
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,790
Hello.

154
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,150
Remember our promise, okay?

155
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,450
Who is this young man?

156
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
His name is Koiso Kenji.

157
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,200
Pleased to meet you.

158
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,800
I know Natsuki-sempai from
our high school physics club...

159
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,350
That is...  He's my boyfriend.

160
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,100
Boyfriend?

161
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,400
Right. My
husband-to-be.

162
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,120

Husband-to-be!

163
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,450
Right.
Husband-to-be.

164
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,850
Really.

165
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,540
Well? I told you  I'd
bring him, didn't I?

166
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,550
Uh? What's going...

167
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,000
- Kenji-san.
 - Yes'm!

168
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,200
This child is yet  immature and naive.

169
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,050
Are you confident  that
you can make her happy?

170
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,350
Ah, umm,

171
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,700
that is...

172
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,800
Well...

173
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,800
I asked whether or not
you have what it takes!

174
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes...

175
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,000
Truly?

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,400
Yes, well...

177
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,950
Would you give your life for her?

178
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,750
...Yes.

179
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,830
That's good to hear.

180
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,600
Oh, right.

181
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,550
What is it?

182
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,990
A present.

183
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,100
A morning glory patterned yukata!

184
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,100
Thank you!

185
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,800
Kenji-san,  pleased to meet you.

186
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,600
No, the  pleasure is mine!

187
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,900
Sorry!

188
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,850
I can't do it!

189
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,500
I'll explain  what
the job's about again.

190
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,600
I'm telling you I can't do it!

191
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,170
You just have to pretend that you're my boyfriend
in front of Grandma and the rest of my relatives.

192
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,040
No, no, no, no!

193
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,130
I can't do it!

194
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,000
I've never even  gone
out with a girl before.

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,650
I'm begging you!

196
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,500
Grandma was always so healthy, so when I
heard she was sick I panicked and told her,

197
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,650
"I'll bring my boyfriend to see
you, so don't die." It was a promise.

198
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,150
Okay? You understand, right?

199
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,900
Ri, right. I understand what you want.

200
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,550
Thanks!

201
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,750
Okay, from now on call me
"Natsuki-chan" instead of "sempai."

202
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,700
It's part of your back story.

203
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,250
Back story?

204
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,000
You're attending Tokyo U,
you're from a distinguished clan,

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,600
and you just got back from studying
abroad in America... should be about it.

206
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,300
Tokyo U, distinguished
clan, studied abroad...

207
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,520
That's everything I'm not!

208
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,250
- Got it? 
- No, I can't do it!

209
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,950
No no no no!

210
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,750
And here you said you'd do anything.

211
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,350
C'mon, just for four days.

212
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,400
Then I can  just tell
them we broke up later.

213
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,100
Please!

214
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,650
You're getting old, aren't you?

215
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,000
Jinnouchi Fishery

216
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,150
Thanks for  the ride.

217
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,500
Sis, your helmet!

218
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,100
And out!  The game is over!

219
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,250
Making a remarkable last-minute comeback
thanks to the pitcher Jinnouchi...

220
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,650
Yeaaaah!

221
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,040
- He wooon! 
- Yeaaah!

222
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,300
What is it? Did he win?

223
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,800
Ryouhei-niichan's awesome!

224
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,830
I'm telling everyone!

225
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,000
- Me too! 
- Me too!

226
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,200
Unexpected indeed!

227
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,000
A miracle has taken place!

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,500
What do you mean, 
"unexpected?" Honestly!

229
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,550
Ryouhei-niichan won!

230
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,670
Oh, that's great!

231
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,600
Be sure to tell Grandma too.

232
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,550
Yeah!

233
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,850
Let's go!

234
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,650
Natsuki!

235
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,010
Where are you, Natsuki?!

236
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,430
What's all the  shouting for, Shouta?

237
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,720
A fiance!

238
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,300
Over my dead body!

239
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,980
Dammit, I should've been on my guard!

240
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,100
- Ryouhei-niichan
won!  - He won!

241
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,350
That's great!

242
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,190
And here's something to celebrate!

243
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,050
- What is it? 
- What is it?

244
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,200
Behold!

245
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,000
Squid!

246
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,990
Aha!

247
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,290
More squid!

248
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,290
Voila!

249
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,790
Uhhh...

250
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,650
Only squid?

251
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,450
Well...

252
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,830
I'll introduce everyone.

253
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,510
Family  Tree

254
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,390
First is great aunt Mariko from the main branch
and her children aunt Rika and uncle Riichi,

255
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,640
and then here's great uncle Mansuke
and uncle Tasuke, aunt Naomi.

256
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,220
Aunt Kiyomi and  uncle
Tasuke's son Shouta.

257
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,240
Over here is great uncle
Mansaku who has three sons.

258
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,270
Uncle Yorihiko's wife  aunt Noriko,

259
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,230
uncle Kunihiko's wife  aunt Nana,

260
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,070
uncle Katsuhiko's wife  aunt Yumi,

261
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,900
aunt Yumi's children
 Yuuhei and Kyouhei,

262
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,990
aunt Nana's daughter Kana,

263
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,490
and aunt Noriko's
children  Shingo and Mao.

264
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
- Got it? 
- Uhh...

265
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,400
Umm, that's...

266
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,850
Well anyway!

267
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,290
Nice to meet you!

268
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,900
Nice to meet you.

269
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,040
Let's have a drink.

270
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,670
So Grandmother gave 
you the green light, hmm?

271
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,000
And every guy I ever brought home
got turned down just like that.

272
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,630
But come on, he's loaded, goes
to Tokyo U, even studied abroad!

273
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,890
Perfect, isn't he?

274
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,940
Really. Almost too  good to be true.

275
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,450
You two spinsters 
should be taking notes!

276
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,610
Shut up!

277
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,350
- What's wrong with being divorced? 
- I'm happy being single!

278
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,450
So, young man. How're the
plans coming along for children?

279
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,240
What?

280
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,600
You know, children.

281
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,120
What're you bringing that up
for, you perverted old man?

282
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,500
He only came to say introduce himself.

283
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,330
Eh? But doesn't that mean

284
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,790
that he's done it with  Natsuki-chan?

285
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
Am I wrong?

286
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,080
Come, you're a college student, aren't
you? How far have you two gotten?

287
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,010
Shush!

288
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,880
Nothing wrong with a bit of friendly
teasing for soon-to-be family, eh?

289
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,180
What do you mean, soon-to-be
family, grandpa? I won't allow it!

290
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,390
Shouta, that's enough.

291
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,650
You shut the hell up!

292
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,220
Is that any way to
speak to your own father?

293
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,020
I'll have you know I watched over
Natsuki since she was just a little kid.

294
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,600
That was years and years ago.

295
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,300
He's got to get permission from
me. I'm her second cousin, you know.

296
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,360
And since when did second cousins
have any say in things like that?

297
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,070
But still!

298
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,030
It's fine, as long as
mother's  given her blessing.

299
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,530
That's everything  in our household.

300
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,940
Grandma, are you 
really sure about this?

301
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,120
Of course.

302
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,500
Kenji-san is excellent  groom material.

303
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,940
My eyes are sharp as ever.

304
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,000
A Jinnouchi man has to 
be solid and trustworthy!

305
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,830
How could he guard his family
and his lands if he were not?

306
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,880
Hear, hear!

307
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,710
The men of Jinnouchi  must be strong!

308
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,020
After all, we of the Jinnouchi were once
soldiers of the awe-inspiring Takeda army!

309
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,810
Here he goes again.

310
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,500
After Takeda's army was defeated his
retainers scattered to the four winds,

311
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,450
and our once glorious
 past was in shambles.

312
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,000
But our ancestors fought
 bravely in many wars

313
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
to hold the land  they'd found in Ueda.

314
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,900
August 2nd, 1585!

315
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,450
Just 2000 of  our ancestors

316
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,960
clashed against 7000
 of Tokugawa's elite!

317
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,750
That was  the first battle of Ueda!

318
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,200
Right in one!

319
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,100
It was a crafty,  wily war!

320
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,350
The enemy thrust forth into
the center of the village,

321
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,750
and there our ancestors took
advantage of the terrain,

322
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,580
driving the enemy to
the river's banks...

323
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,900
Turn around.

324
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,070
Why did I have to lose that
game of rock-paper-scissors?

325
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,600
I have to admit I'm jealous.
Pretending to be her boyfriend, huh?

326
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,750
There's nothing  to be
jealous of. It's just a job.

327
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,800
So come on,  how is it? Fun?

328
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,280
I'm surrounded by strangers.  It's hard.

329
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,100
Oh, sure. As if.

330
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,200
You're sleeping under the same roof as
Natsuki-sempai, the prettiest girl in school!

331
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,000
Since you're pretending to be her boyfriend anyway,
you might as well ask to share the same room.

332
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,600
Wh-what?!

333
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
There's no way that'd fly!

334
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,300
Well, best of luck.

335
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,650
Huh? Where am I?

336
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,730
Now that I look at it,
this is one big house.

337
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,600
What do you want?

338
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,620
Uhh, I'm just a little lost.

339
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,660
The bathroom's  around
the corner to your right.

340
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
Thanks.

341
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,900
Shouldn't you  be with everyone else?

342
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,890
Mommy!

343
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,810
You haven't toweled off yet.

344
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,970
Kana...

345
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,730

S-s-sorry!

346
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,550
The bathroom's free. 
You should take a bath.

347
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,340
No, I, that is, I don't
need to, not today, umm...

348
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,700
Natsuki-sempai's  been in this tub...

349
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,400
- It was a tie! 
- A tie!

350
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,300
Hayate, it's me.

351
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,600
Have you forgotten me?

352
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,470
Why are you here?

353
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,380
What do you mean by
that?  This is my home.

354
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,800
Like hell  it is!

355
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,600
Fiery as ever,  aren't
you, Mariko-obasan.

356
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,450
Things haven't changed a
bit since ten years ago.

357
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,150
The same goes for you.

358
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,300
Is that any  way to act,

359
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,500
showing your face for the
first time in a decade?

360
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,700
What's the  occasion?

361
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,400
The birthday  celebration is on Sunday.

362
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,700
Whose?

363
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,000
Wabisuke.

364
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,250
Wabisuke?

365
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,200
Hey, granny.  Still alive?

366
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,750
I should say the same. I was worried
you'd had an accident somewhere.

367
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,850
That attitude would keep
you breathing past a hundred.

368
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,750
Have you...

369
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,520
had anything to eat?

370
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,950
I'm not hungry.

371
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,190
Japan's really  a bore.

372
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,050
Humid and  hot summer,

373
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,450
narrow roads,

374
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,000
and full to bursting  with people.

375
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,040
But at least the  beer's great.

376
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Ojisan?

377
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,760
Wabisuke-ojisan!

378
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,760
Natsuki?

379
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,260
Is that you, Natsuki?

380
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,400
Awesome!  You came back!

381
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,050
Natsuki!  Let go of him.

382
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,100
Why?  Come on...

383
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,100
It's already been a decade, huh.

384
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,070
Like they say, time flies.

385
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,060
Umm... who is  Wabisuke-san, exactly?

386
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,060
You've never met him
before, have you, Nana-chan?

387
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,700
It's a complicated story.

388
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,750
It's not complicated
 at all. He's family.

389
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,800
Long story short he's the
son of Grandfather's mistress.

390
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,830
Really?

391
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,460
It was commonplace 
back in the old days.

392
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,790
He sold the deed  to
Grandma's mountains,

393
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,090
took the money and  ran
all the way to America!

394
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,470
He's a horrible,  selfish man.

395
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,750
Really?

396
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,140
You haven't  married yet?

397
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,650
Then, do you have a girlfriend?

398
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,250
Why would  you want to know?

399
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,450
Great.

400
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,870
I'll come visit  you in America soon.

401
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,430
You can take me  to the Disney resorts.

402
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,940
First California,  then Florida.

403
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,400
And then we'll go back  to your place.

404
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,400
Give me your phone
number so I can call you.

405
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,700
If you win.

406
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,240
Huh? Come on!

407
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,700
That's more fun, isn't it?

408
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,260
Fine...

409
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,330
Hah!

410
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,330
3 bright! There you go.

411
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,460
Want to stop?

412
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,080
Not yet.

413
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,350
Koi koi!

414
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,210
I see. Then, my turn.

415
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,340
Going for 4 bright, hmm?

416
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,800
N-not really...

417
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,500
What a shame!

418
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,140
3 plain.

419
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,020
Ah, koi koi?

420
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,650
Nope.

421
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,930
Come on!

422
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,650
I win.

423
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,840
Now, time for  you kids to go to bed.

424
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,450
I don't wanna.  One more?

425
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,360
I like to  cut and run.

426
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,320
Take it from here.

427
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,990
I haven't figured  out the rules yet...

428
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,900
Hey, how long are you going to stay?

429
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,450
Dunno.

430
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,660
Just don't leave at all!

431
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,120
Right? Got it?

432
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,550
What am I  doing here?

433
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,350
<i>Text message</i>

434
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,190
What is this?

435
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,650
Got it!

436
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,080
<i>Message sent</i>

437
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,180
What was that?

438
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,920
Let's see how she's doing...

439
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,160
<i>Blood Pressure  Heartbeat</i>

440
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,750
- Get up! 
- Get up!

441
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,600
Wake up already!

442
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,090
Get uuup!

443
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,840
The damage is quite extensive, yes.

444
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,390
What what what what what?

445
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,450
Look!

446
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,140
That's him, isn't it?

447
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,140
Dead certain. He's the culprit!

448
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,480
The culprit is a minor? A student!?

449
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,700
Now, the more I look at him,
the younger he seems to be.

450
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,400
He must be a high schooler, right?

451
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,280
That's...

452
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,530
that's me!

453
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,910
This young man has managed to infiltrate
OZ's system and plunge it into chaos.

454
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,250
<i>Current state of OZ</i>

455
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,660
It'll be quite a while until
things are back to normal.

456
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,160
The attack seems to have
been carried out on a whim.

457
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,880
A pleasure crime, then. I did notice that
I couldn't read my mail in the morning.

458
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,600
You know, there are almost as many OZ
subscribers as there are cell phone users.

459
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,720
Since every aspect of everyday life,
from shopping to taking care of business

460
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,810
will be affected by this 
attack, it seems certain that

461
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,560
punishment will be unavoidable even
if it was only a pleasure crime.

462
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
What's a pleasure crime?

463
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Something that feels good?

464
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,150
What's so funny over there?

465
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,320
Breakfast time!

466
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,110
- Hey! Gimme– 
- No!

467
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,870
Hang on! No! Give me that! Give it back!

468
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,450
Criminal, criminal!

469
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,000
Give it to me!

470
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,080
He's evil!

471
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,460
It's not me!

472
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,300
Huh?

473
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,710
Time to eat!

474
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,300
<i>Unable to access the OZ Family network.

475
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,300

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,720
Why?

479
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,700

480
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,400
There!

481
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,100
Are you behind this?

482
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,300
Hey, lemme use your PC!

483
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,900

485
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,700
Excuse me, but may I please

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,500
use your computer for a moment?

487
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,040
Thanks!

488
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,250
Why?

489
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,570
What's wrong?

490
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,880
I think my  account's been hijacked!

491
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,600
So you've been framed, huh.

492
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,680
What do I do?

493
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,430
Call customer support.

494
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,140
That's right!

495
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,140
Hello? He–

496
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,600
Your OZ account has 
not been authenticated,

497
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,150
so you cannot peruse
 your cellular phone.

498
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,940
I can't call them!  It won't work!

499
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,230
Calm down.

500
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,190
Koiso-kun.

501
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,030
I told you, calm down.

502
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,030
It's a Sakuma-san calling from Tokyo.

503
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,250
Don't tell me you're behind this.

504
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,120
Of course I'm not!

505
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,410
Figured. You don't have the motive or
the guts to pull off something like this.

506
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,540
All right, already! Help me out!

507
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,300
Ain't gonna happen.

508
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,450
The password's been changed. I
can't connect to the control sector.

509
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,420
I thought OZ's security was
supposed to be world class!

510
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,720
A strange e-mail was spread
all through OZ yesterday.

511
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,680
A strange e-mail?

512
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,150
OZ's security is locked
 with a 2056 number code.

513
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,430
It can't be hacked  so easily.

514
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,640
But it looks like someone managed
to crack the code in just one night!

515
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,440
2056 numbers?

516
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,980
What's the first number?

517
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,050
Eight.

518
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,900
That....  that was me.

519
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,110
I solved it.

520
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,950
What?

521
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,850
I just thought it was some
kind of math problem and...

522
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,350
So you cracked it?  You idiot!

523
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,540
Sorry.

524
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,540
Awesome.

525
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,500
Whatever. I made a guest avatar
for you using that phone number.

526
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,880
It's better than  nothing, right?

527
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,930
Use that until this 
stuff's been settled.

528
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,350
This...  is me?

529
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,090
This is an announcement from OZ.

530
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,450
Some of our services 
are currently unavailable.

531
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,600
We repeat.

532
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,850
This is an announcement from OZ.

533
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,850
Some of our services are
currently unavailable.

534
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,400
Hello?  Excuse me!

535
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Please stop playing 
around with my avatar.

536
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,000
This person's  framing me!

537
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,750
My account's  been stolen!

538
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,790
Just who is he,  anyway?

539
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,510
What do you find so funny
about wreaking havoc like this?

540
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,350
It's not right to do whatever you
want just because it's the Internet!

541
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,350
Battle mode?

542
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,900
But it should only be
active in certain areas...

543
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,940
This is bad.

544
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,440
The regulations of every
 field have been altered.

545
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,570
In a language I can
understand, please...

546
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,200
All of OZ has been 
made into a battleground!

547
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,400
Run away!

548
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,540
Um, let's talk this over.

549
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,940
Let's talk this over!

550
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,500
Defend yourself!

551
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,640
What're you doing?  Move it.

552
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,690
That's...

553
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,720
King Kazma!

554
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,630
Awesome.

555
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,430
So you're...

556
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,650
Don't talk to me.  I can't concentrate.

557
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,540
You got him!

558
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,000
He's just a scrub.

559
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,700
There he is!

560
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,060
We've found the criminal!

561
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,550
Right! Arrest him!

562
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,330
Arrest him!

563
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,040
Grab him!

564
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,200
Stop it!

565
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,510
Save me!

566
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,070
It...

567
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,050
transformed.

568
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,850
Damn it! Damn it!

569
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,550
This bastard...

570
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,180
Are you playing a game?

571
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,640
Lemme play too.

572
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,890
Outta the way!

573
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,430
That was close.

574
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,720
You almost lost  your account, too.

575
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,440
Here we go.

576
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,020
And, go!

577
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,700
You sing too,  Wabisuke-ojisan!

578
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,900
I'll pass.

579
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,350
Leave him be.

580
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,450
Ojichan,  what're you looking at?

581
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,750
Women with big tits.

582
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,850
What were you doing in America?

583
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,100
I was a ninja.

584
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,700
Really?

585
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,700
I think I've found the real culprit.

586
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,510
Not human?

587
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,800
What do you mean, not human?

588
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,020
It's an A.I.

589
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,100
An artificial intelligence.

590
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,750
It looks like an experimental
hacking A.I. under development

591
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,980
in Pittsburg managed  to break loose.

592
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,100
Break loose?

593
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,480
It's called "Love Machine."

594
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,400
Love Machine?

595
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,300
I wish I could  ask him to stop.

596
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,250
Honestly, I'm going crazy
 without my cell phone.

597
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,130
If Ryouhei advances  to the nationals,

598
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,000
let's all go visit a hot
spring!  I'll pay for everyone.

599
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,750
Sounds good.

600
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,960
Haven't I seen that face somewhere?

601
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,140
Natsuki!

602
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,600
What's going on here!

603
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:26,380
I just ran a search on his personal file through
the district office's OZ, and what's this?

604
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,220
He's not from an old clan at all!

605
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,320
He's just some  salaryman's son!

606
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,980
And a high schooler at that!
He's younger than you are!

607
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,750
I just got  
this fax. Look!

608
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,820
Tokyo U?  
Studied abroad? Ha!

609
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,740
Umm, well...

610
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,700
Now for our next item.

611
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,500
The planetary probe Arawashi's capsule
has failed to detach from the main body.

612
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,600
King Kazma, the weakest ever!!

613
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,920
What is this stuff? It's unbelievable.

614
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,130
Don't let it get to
you.  It's just a game.

615
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,130
It's not a game.

616
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,010
It's a sport.

617
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,760
Huh?

618
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,840
I like the fighting  and winning part,

619
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,600
not the gaming part.

620
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,970
I see.

621
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,430
But he's different.

622
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,500
He likes to play games.  I can tell.

623
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,980
Then... what's  he after?

624
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,030
There he is!

625
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,570
There he is!

626
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,600
They found out.

627
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,210
Uhh, Sakuchousei High's
 are no laughing matter,

628
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,580
but I believe that we'll 
secure the title in the end.

629
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,630
Go, Ueda High!

630
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,430
Why did you lie about this?

631
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,530
Did you think your grandmother
would be happy with lies?

632
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,380
I thought that something was
fishy when I heard his specs.

633
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,720
Though if you're looking for a Tokyo U graduate
who's from an old clan, and studied abroad,

634
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,400
I can think of someone who
fits the bill in our own family.

635
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,240
That's right, Wabisuke.

636
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,530
You're right, but what's
that got to do with anything?

637
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,490
Wait.

638
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,110
Do you think Natsuki's
first crush was...

639
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,950
Right! She always liked
 to hang around Wabisuke.

640
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,950
She used to say she loved him even
back when she was in kindergarten.

641
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,850
She even wrote an essay
 called "Ojjisan and I."

642
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,300
Noooo!

643
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,340
Stop it!

644
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,800
Just forget about it!

645
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,350
So that's how it was, huh.

646
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,000
Either way!

647
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,700
The real issue here is 
that this guy's a criminal!

648
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,550
He's got a point.

649
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,700
We can't have someone 
like that staying here.

650
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,950
You're a cop, aren't you?

651
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,770
Not gonna arrest him?

652
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,100
Oh, yeah.

653
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,150
Cool.

654
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,250
He's really being arrested!

655
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,550
Don't stare!

656
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,320
Time is 12:30pm.

657
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,820
The charges  are... uh...

658
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,160
Was that really you  on the news?

659
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,910
I don't know the
specifics  of what went on,

660
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,290
but was that  really you?

661
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,750
- I'm innocent. 
- There'll be time for making excuses later!

662
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,540
Hey!

663
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,090
I'm sorry it had  to end like this,

664
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,210
but I really  enjoyed my time here.

665
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,590
Let him speak.

666
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,680
My father was always 
away on business trips,

667
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,600
and my mother held 
down a full-time job too,

668
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,800
so I was always  alone at home.

669
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,800
Having dinner as a family,
 playing hanafuda...

670
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,150
this was the first time in my
life I've ever felt so warm.

671
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,100
I was happy.

672
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,800
Thank you  for your hospitality.

673
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,600
Thank you,  everyone.

674
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,850
- You're welcome. 
- Bye bye!

675
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:45,800
Natsuki-sempai.

676
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,050
Natsuki-sempai!

677
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,550
Shut up!

678
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,900
On the mound is  Ueda High's Jinnouchi.

679
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,150
No hits and no runs so
far!  Give them hell!

680
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,840
Go, go, go, go!

681
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,700
Jinnouchi  winds up and–

682
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,510
<i>Breaking News</i>

683
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,900
Huuuh?

684
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,590
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you breaking news.

685
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,430
I don't care about  Arawashi!

686
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,800
- Yumi-chan.
 - Yes!

687
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,830
We're going to  have
a lot of guests today.

688
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,850
There's lots to do,  so come help.

689
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,940
Okay.

690
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,450
This car  isn't a patrol car, is it?

691
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,320
- Shut up! 
- Sorry!

692
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,070
- Oi! 
- Yes!

693
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,150
Why aren't they moving?
 It's a green light!

694
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,300
I'm sorry!

695
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,850
You're not even close
to getting here? Why?

696
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,750
The GPS navigator's on the fritz.

697
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,570
We're around Saitama but the
screen says we're in Hokkaido.

698
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,480
And the traffic's brutal.

699
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,100
I can't say when  we'll get there.

700
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,200
You can't say?  The party
is only two days away!

701
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,950
It's fine. The hubbie's on his
way overnight on the Shinkansen.

702
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,300
Tell Natsuki  too, will you?

703
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,500
And it's a hit!  The batter's off!

704
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,750
He just barely makes
it to 1st base! Safe!

705
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,050
My apologies. I don't think I'll
be able to leave Tokyo today.

706
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,900
You too, Kazuo-san? What's the matter?

707
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,060
Someone's messed  with
the water pressure.

708
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:53,720
The underground gas pipes
and power lines are in danger.

709
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,450
Tell Natsuki I'll try and make it
over on the Shinkansen tomorrow.

710
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,640
This won't do!

711
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,110
I've already finished 
the seating arrangements!

712
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,030
The sacrifice bunt  is a success! Safe!

713
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,610
Make way for the  ambulance, please.

714
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,930
Can't make it? How come?

715
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,350
Emergency alerts from elderly living
alone are going off all over Matsumoto.

716
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,600
Fat chance of that happening, huh.

717
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,590
Huh? Over in Suwa too?

718
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,400
We got a call and we're
 on the scene right now,

719
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,860
but there's no fire.

720
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,800
This has been  going on all day.

721
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,890
But you worked overtime too, didn't you?

722
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,810
We still have to check.  You never know.

723
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,700
We can't afford to 
miss a real emergency.

724
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,600
The ship's docked at  the wrong harbor?

725
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,400
Things are chaotic in Nagoya too?

726
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,950
You can't make it?

727
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,700
Kazuma's waiting.

728
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,420
You're going back?  To Sendai?

729
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,830
You need to go to the bathroom?

730
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,250
Right,  it's never
healthy to hold it in.

731
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,900
Don't sweat it.

732
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,600
Fine, I'll tell
Mariko-obasan  you can't come.

733
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,680
Hey, Kajitoshi-ojisan from
Matsuyama says he can't...

734
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,900
Huh?

735
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,820
Why is everyone suddenly
saying they can't make it?

736
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,250
What's going on?

737
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,980
And look at the pitcher, Jinnouchi!

738
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,500
With no outs and bases
loaded, he's in dire straights!

739
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,630
Dammit! What's up with this!
Lunchtime's almost over!

740
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,620
Turn around!

741
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:40,510
They say traffic's
jammed  for 60 kilometers.

742
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,500
If Natsuki hadn't asked,
you would've been in for it!

743
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,800
What's  going on?

744
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,400
- Terrorism? 
-Huh?

745
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,000
Welcome home.

746
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,450
What're you  doing back here?

747
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,220
I'm sorry, well...

748
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,050
Did you forget something?

749
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,550
No, well...

750
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,600
Use the on  board GPS.

751
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,900
Call the fishermen's union too.

752
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,120
Didn't Yorihiko and his brothers say
they were going to try hashigo-nori?

753
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,120
(T/N: Acrobatics performed
on a tall bamboo ladder.)

754
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,160
Ain't the time to worry about that.

755
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,350
And I ordered the birthday dumplings
to match the number of guests, too.

756
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,800
It's iffy whether or not they
can even deliver the dumplings.

757
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,700
What?

758
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,450
Nobody seems to  care about the party!

759
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,500
I've been making 
preparations since last month!

760
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,400
Love Machine's behind all of this.

761
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,900
It can steal any account
it wants with that password.

762
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,230
Account?

763
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,270
Your identification on OZ.

764
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,400
OZ supports so many 
real-life services that

765
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,700
an account's authority is
effectively the same as its owner.

766
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,000
You can use a water official's account
to change the city's water system,

767
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,200
and a Japanese Railways Group employee's
account to turn a train around.

768
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,150
There're more than a billion
subscribers worldwide.

769
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,150
Countless organizations
 use OZ accounts to work.

770
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,530
Looks like OZ's security
system has backfired on them.

771
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,450
Right.

772
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:03,160
With the US President's account you
might even be able to launch a nuke.

773
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:03,950
What?

774
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,450
This is all because of me.

775
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,750
All me...

776
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,200
I should really arrest you right now!

777
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,950
Due to severe traffic congestion, even
emergency vehicles are unable to move about.

778
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,450
We ask that all commuters
please make way for them.

779
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,650
This is almost like an  enemy invasion.

780
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,300
What's an enemy?

781
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:27,360
People's lives may  be in danger.

782
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,070
Hello, what's your emergency?

783
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,800
Huh? Grandma!

784
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,100
Why're you calling an  emergency number?

785
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,550
Yorihiko! Make sure to 
visit all the elderly! Got it?

786
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,920
Kunihiko! This is no time 
to be lazing about! Move it!

787
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,350
Understand, Katsuhiko? This is a battle.

788
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:51,550
- I'll do what I can. 
- What you can? Huh?

789
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,500
Kan-chan? It's me, Sakae.

790
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,500
It's been a while, hasn't it?

791
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,300
I'm asking as a fellow 
retainer of the Takeda clan:

792
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,880
what kind of emergency
plan is the MLIT setting up?

793
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,400
What? You're just now
planning a meeting to discuss?

794
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,690
Don't give me that bullshit!

795
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,520
Sone-yan? Get some
medical  people together

796
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:18,400
and help the emergency
workers. Even the retired ones.

797
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,050
It's your fool of a son's chance to finally
be some help to the world with that NPO of his.

798
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,000
Itomi-san, it's important
that everyone communicates

799
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,270
with one another like the old days.

800
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,420
That's your  specialty, isn't it?

801
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,830
Sen-san, your decisions are
going to be crucial here.

802
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,600
I know it's not easy,

803
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,950
but it's not worth  people's lives.

804
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,200
Don't call me sensei,

805
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,660
just listen to an old  woman's request.

806
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,340
Why're you bringing up
those long gone days, kiddo?

807
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,950
It's been half a century
 since I beat you up.

808
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,060
Thousands, no, tens of thousands
of people are in danger.

809
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,720
If you don't step up
now,  then when will you?

810
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,180
Don't give up.

811
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,740
No matter what, you can't give up.

812
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,900
This is something  only you can do.

813
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,000
You can do it.

814
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,410
I'm telling you, you can.

815
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,500
Right, that's the spirit.

816
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,000
The man she's talking 
to is the chief of Police.

817
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,930
Incredible.

818
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:19,450
Everyone's listening
to  what she has to say.

819
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,550
Am I deaf?  Don't get uppity with me.

820
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,500
Check to make sure your dentures
aren't falling out first!

821
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,950
I'm not that old yet!

822
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,400
OZ's engineering team
 is out in full force,

823
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,550
but they still haven't even
gotten close to the control sector.

824
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,200
Try and type in something.

825
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,450
An encrypted code should pop up
if you enter the wrong password.

826
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,250
This is a code?

827
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,000
You can do it!

828
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,750
You can!

829
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,480
What the hell is he?

830
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,950
Japan's representative
in the math Olympiads.

831
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,800
Almost, that is.

832
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,140
I'm done!

833
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,250
We're in!

834
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,290
Sad news, Kenji.

835
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,120
Huh?

836
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,010
Looking into the security
logs in the database,

837
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,450
55 people worldwide  managed
to crack the code yesterday,

838
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:49,800
but your  name isn't among them.

839
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,500
What? Why?

840
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,100
You got the last letter  wrong! BZZZT!

841
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,900
What?  Dammit, you're not the culprit?

842
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,800
But it looks like everyone who sent
in a reply had their avatars stolen.

843
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,900
Hey, cheer up.

844
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,920
You got it right this time.

845
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,720
And so, though there was
much confusion nationwide,

846
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,680
thankfully there were no casualties.

847
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,120
The trouble was caused by

848
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:21,450
a system error brought about when two
identical accounts were accidentally generated.

849
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,420
It has been announced,
 however, that it is

850
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:32,650
technologically impossible to purposely
misuse OZ's system for malicious intent.

851
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,400
Here we are recapping the 10th day of the Nagano
High School Baseball tournament, with Ueda High...

852
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,700
Everyone quiet down a moment!

853
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,500
Though both teams scored many
runs in the final innings,

854
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,370
Ueda High defeated  Sakuchousei High

855
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,110
and has advanced to the
finals, to be held tomorrow.

856
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,600
- Great! 
- Hooray!

857
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,950
Beats me how they managed to win
letting 30 hits through, though.

858
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,200
It's a miracle!

859
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,920
You can tell when he thinks he's gonna
lose. It's written all over his face.

860
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,440
Like father, like son, eh?

861
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,930
Natsuki, what about  your mom and dad?

862
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,850
Dad's pulling an all-nighter
with repairs on the water pipes.

863
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,450
Mom's still  in Saitama.

864
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,150
She's staying the night
at a business hotel.

865
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:16,150
I see. That's good.

866
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:19,900
It's all thanks to Grandma
 giving everyone orders

867
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,900
that this whole thing
 calmed down quickly.

868
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,940
Right, Grandma?

869
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,280
I never gave  anyone orders.

870
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,650
Oh, come on!

871
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:29,700
Our Grandma's great!

872
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:30,980
Japan's best!

873
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,200
You rascals.

874
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,850
Kenji-san, I hear you stepped
up to the occasion today as well.

875
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,500
No, I...  I didn't really...

876
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,000
Natsuki's boyfriend?

877
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,040
He's not her boyfriend!

878
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,290
I hear he fixed  the problem with OZ.

879
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,200
I thought he was still a high schooler!

880
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,760
Not bad, boyfriend.

881
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:50,250
I'm telling you, he ain't her boyfriend!

882
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,630
What do you care about it?

883
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,000
And now for an update on the OZ
incident which took place this morning.

884
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,600
Though the system has been restored,

885
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,400
over 2 million accounts in  Japan alone

886
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,150
are still inaccessible.

887
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,730
Though the cause is not  yet clear,

888
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,750
the government has advised all OZ users
to take care in managing their accounts.

889
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,900
What is it?

890
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,900
It's about OZ...

891
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,150
But...

892
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,400
Love Machine  hasn't been beaten yet.

893
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:16,700
That's right.

894
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,790
Love Machine?

895
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,300
What's that? Morning Musume?

896
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,250
An A.I. that steals accounts.

897
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,040
- What? 
- Let's see.

898
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,000
It's got  a creepy avatar.

899
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,130
Has bad guy written all over him.

900
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,130
So this thing's behind all
the stuff that happened today.

901
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,400
But why wasn't this
reported in the news?

902
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,750
I think it's just a
matter of time, Master.

903
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,600
The Internet's everywhere,

904
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,950
and the people who've noticed what's
going on are already talking about it.

905
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:42,200
If we pool our knowledge and
resources, we should be able to stop it.

906
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,750
Sorry, but that's  not gonna happen.

907
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,700
How do you know that?

908
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,250
How? Well...

909
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,100
I'm the one who developed  that thing.

910
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,600
You made Love Machine?

911
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:11,950
Yeah.

912
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:15,500
It's a hacking A.I. that I designed.

913
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,150
I just did one thing.

914
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:46,500
I gave a machine the urge  to know.

915
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,000
Then the military of
some country  came to me,

916
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,050
and asked me to sell it to them
so they could run some tests.

917
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,150
I didn't think those tests would  be OZ.

918
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,720
Doesn't matter, I guess.

919
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,750
The results are outstanding.

920
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,650
That thing's urge to know

921
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:08,400
will make it keep collecting information
and authority from across the world.

922
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,600
As of now, Love Machine holds the
same power as an army millions strong.

923
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:16,000
Got it? That's  why you can't win.

924
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,740
Do you know how many 
people were hurt today?

925
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,400
Do you know how much
 confusion was caused?

926
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:24,610
You're saying it's my fault?

927
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,550
Of course not. The A.I. did it.

928
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:29,340
The world's in chaos  because of you!

929
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,200
You guys just don't get it, do you.

930
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,590
- I said that the A.I.– 
- You really think that makes it okay?

931
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,400
Don't do it.

932
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,200
You're a coward  hiding
behind that excuse!

933
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,300
Calm down!

934
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,100
I'm telling you!

935
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:44,200
I just developed the damn thing, I never told
the artificial intelligence to do anything!

936
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:44,400
Shut up!

937
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,200
Stop it! What do you think
you're doing with Grandma here?

938
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,750
Wabisuke.

939
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,850
- What's the hubbub? 
- Ssh!

940
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,070
You understand, right, Grandma?

941
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,700
I'm sorry for all the trouble
I've caused you up to now.

942
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,600
I've been working to 
make it all up to you.

943
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,600
so that I could come back to
this house with my head held high.

944
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,700
Grandma, look at this.

945
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:22,500
The American military's
given me an official contract.

946
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,390
We're going to get  more money

947
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,000
than even Father managed to earn.

948
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,400
This is all thanks to you, Grandma.

949
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:35,800
I was able to develop it
with the money you had, see.

950
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,150
Mother!

951
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,000
Run!

952
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,340
Wabisuke!

953
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,830
Pay the price for your crimes!

954
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,100
I shouldn't have come back.

955
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,600
Ojisan!

956
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,320
Natsuki!

957
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:25,660
Listen up, you all!

958
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:29,100
We must take care of the
problem caused by one of our own!

959
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,450
Sempai.

960
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,530
Natsuki-sempai.

961
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,400
Don't come near me.

962
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,100
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.

963
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,470
These legs of mine just
won't listen to me anymore.

964
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,220
You shouldn't  have
exerted yourself so much.

965
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,200
Thank you.

966
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,400
Then, I'll be going now.

967
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:38,600
Do you want to play a game of hanafuda?

968
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,550
The whole family used  to play together,

969
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:49,900
but these days it's hard to find
someone willing to play against me.

970
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,350
You can go first.

971
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,500
Yes, ma'am.

972
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,200
I'm sorry you had to see
that embarrassing spectacle.

973
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,500
It's nothing.

974
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:03,600
Even Natsuki's  foolishness.

975
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,300
Koi koi.

976
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,100
- Not bad. 
- Thank you.

977
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:11,800
Now if  I win this round...

978
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,750
You have to have something
on the line to make it fun.

979
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,100
There, koi koi.

980
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,200
All right then... If I win,

981
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,450
I want you to take care of that girl.

982
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,800
She's still too  immature
to be a good fiancee,

983
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,800
but if you can look  past those faults,

984
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,200
I want to ask  you one more time.

985
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,170
Take care  of Natsuki.

986
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,500
I...

987
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,800
I don't yet have that 
kind of faith in myself.

988
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:52,600
You can do it.

989
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,100
All I can offer is
that  I'll do my best.

990
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,800
I win!

991
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,770
- Oh no! Get over here! 
- I'm coming!

992
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,700
Quickly!

993
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,250
Grandma!

994
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,760
Open your eyes!

995
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,800
Grandma!

996
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,000
Wake up!

997
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,490
Grandma!

998
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,250
Grandma, can you hear us?

999
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,660
Grandma!

1000
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:38,550
Please wake up!

1001
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,400
- Switch with me. 
- That's enough.

1002
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,150
No, Katsuhiko!  Keep going!

1003
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,960
It's no use.

1004
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,150
Keep going!

1005
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,700
Everyone's here, right?

1006
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,660
5:21 am.

1007
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:30,900
She was taking  heart medicine.

1008
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,950
I used this to monitor
 the state of her body.

1009
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:36,700
Her heartbeat, blood
pressure, perspiration.

1010
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,510
An alarm should have rung
if anything went wrong,

1011
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,600
but I stopped receiving
 data last night.

1012
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,680
The trouble in OZ?

1013
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,770
I guess the system manager's ID
was one of the stolen accounts.

1014
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,190
That means she'd  have
lived if not for that!

1015
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,100
No, I think it was just her time to go.

1016
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,100
What? Like hell it was!

1017
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,060
Where's Wabisuke?

1018
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,000
I'll beat the living
daylights out of him!

1019
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,400
I think he took Shouta's
 car and left last night.

1020
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,340
Nobody knows  how to contact him,

1021
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,570
because he's been gone for ten years.

1022
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,800
Damn it!

1023
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,200
Excuse me.

1024
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,150
Stop them.

1025
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:22,550
The tears...

1026
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:28,270
Hold me here.

1027
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,150
Make them stop.

1028
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:19,090
Now for our next item. The
number of people unable to access

1029
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,150
their OZ accounts  since
yesterday's incident

1030
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:25,070
has reached over 10   million worldwide.

1031
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,480
Has anyone told Ryouhei?

1032
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:31,200
We decided to wait  until
after tomorrow's match.

1033
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:33,650
Yeah.

1034
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,280
Today's going to be a busy day.

1035
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,650
Noriko-chan,
Yumi-chan, Nana-chan.

1036
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,500
I'll leave the cooking to you.

1037
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,000
I hope there'll be  enough sake.

1038
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,600
Mansaku,  I want you
to visit the temple,

1039
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:52,500
and Yorihiko, I want you and your
brothers to tell the neighbors and guests,

1040
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:55,000
and find some people
willing to help out.

1041
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,000
Everyone understand?

1042
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,800
Ain't we got more 
important things to do?

1043
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,650
That's right, mother! 
The birthday dumplings!

1044
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,900
We've got to change the
order to funeral dumplings.

1045
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,850
To hell with the dumplings!

1046
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,050
We've got to strike back!

1047
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,000
We have to bash that 
machine to bits! Right?

1048
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:13,890
Honestly, that's enough.

1049
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,600
What?

1050
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:17,400
You're no help  at all, little brother.

1051
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,690
What does age have  to do with anything?

1052
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,030
We of the Jinnouchi have to raise
our battle standards and fight!

1053
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,700
What's gotten into you, dad?

1054
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:27,240
We have to hold Grandma's funeral first.

1055
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,350
That's not as important!

1056
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,880
Wouldn't she want us to
fight and avenge her honor?!

1057
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:32,500
Umm.

1058
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:34,790
I agree.

1059
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:40,840
Up till now, we never realized
that what happened in OZ

1060
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:42,700
could endanger the 
lives of real people.

1061
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:43,900
He's dangerous.

1062
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:48,430
Something like what happened
here could happen anywhere else.

1063
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:52,190
So we, at least,  have to stop him.

1064
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,480
What're you talking about?

1065
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,550
That is, we have to stop any
more people from getting–

1066
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:01,020
Who're you to be sticking your
nose into our family matters, huh?

1067
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:02,820
But...

1068
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:06,000
How can we worry about other
people on a day like this?

1069
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,280
But...

1070
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,750
Well then, everyone!

1071
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,900
I'm ashamed of the lot of you.

1072
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,420
How can you say  you're Jinnouchi men?

1073
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:24,300
I understand how you feel, father,
but it's about time you acted your age.

1074
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:28,170
I didn't ask for your opinion.

1075
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,590
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't
have spoken out of turn...

1076
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,390
No, you were right.

1077
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,110
You have to protect 
others to protect yourself.

1078
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,150
Is that the JSDF motto?

1079
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:40,180
No... it's a line from
"The Seven Samurai."

1080
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:40,940
Tasuke-ojisan.

1081
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:41,900
Hmm?

1082
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,540
Do you stock computers  at your store?

1083
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:44,430
Of course.

1084
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,040
Do you have any better  than this?

1085
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,050
Of course we do.

1086
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Kazuma-kun.

1087
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:52,950
We need to fight him.

1088
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,200
This is revenge.

1089
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,580
Honestly, that Mansuke. What
in the world was he thinking?

1090
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,350
There aren't any good pictures here.

1091
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:04,100
Hey, how about this one?

1092
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,420
Ah, this was the one taken
for that one award ceremony.

1093
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:07,500
That'll do the trick.

1094
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,680
April 1600,

1095
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:13,060
Tokugawa Hidetada's  army of 38,000

1096
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,800
struck at Ueda Castle.

1097
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:17,730
Our forces at the time
numbered a paltry 2,000 men.

1098
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:20,800
Then how did our 
ancestors face this battle?

1099
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:27,000
After deliberately luring
 the enemy into the castle,

1100
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,450
they closed and locked the
gates, trapping them inside.

1101
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:32,600
Trapped like rats,  Tokugawa's army

1102
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,500
lost its will to fight
 and was defeated.

1103
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,850
That was the  second siege of Ueda.

1104
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,000
Did that help any?

1105
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,750
That's a good idea.

1106
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:42,750
Then with that in mind...

1107
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:46,450
Hello, Sakuma?

1108
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,000
What're you starting now?

1109
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:50,750
A war.

1110
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,950
Do you think this will do
for the bedside decorations?

1111
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,700
Well, I guess it will do.

1112
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:59,800
Even though she's passed on,
her face looks so peaceful.

1113
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:01,800
It does.

1114
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:05,800
I dunno if this'll fit.

1115
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,400
You have things  like this in stock?

1116
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,800
"Electronics store" doesn't
just mean household appliances.

1117
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,200
Actually we sell stuff to schools
and government agencies too.

1118
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,670
This was actually 
slated for a university.

1119
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,500
Is it okay to use it?

1120
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,900
It's fine. We're just 
borrowing it for a bit.

1121
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,650
But why did he  suddenly decide on this?

1122
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:36,650
It's all thanks to you standing
up to the women, Kenji-kun.

1123
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,100
Kazuma must've  seen
that as a motivator.

1124
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:41,640
The women of our  clan
are strong and assertive,

1125
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,070
so the menfolk  tend to be more passive.

1126
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,500
Now I need a source of electricity...

1127
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:55,450
Outta the way!

1128
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:03,470
Great, isn't it? This is my boat.

1129
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:05,700
Takes 2 hours to  get here from Niigata.

1130
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:08,250
It can put out up  to 300 kilowatts!

1131
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,010
Watch out, you two.

1132
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:11,250
I'm gonna  dunk it.

1133
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:25,900
Incredible.

1134
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,300
What is this?

1135
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,900
A military-grade  antenna module.

1136
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,700
Borrowed it from the
American base in Matsumoto.

1137
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:39,990
What exactly do you  do
in the JSDF, Riichi-san?

1138
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:45,500
That's classified.

1139
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:48,290
What's gotten  into those men?

1140
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:52,210
- It's a big jeep! 
- Look outside!

1141
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:53,250
Don't make such a commotion!

1142
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,050
Behave yourselves, children.

1143
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:57,650
Okay.

1144
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,000
Is it all right for us to
 just sit around like this?

1145
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,100
It's the mourning period.  Calm down.

1146
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,530
3 days is a bit too long for my tastes.

1147
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:08,300
I keep thinking  about my work.

1148
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,050
Forget that for now.

1149
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,150
That's not going to work.

1150
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,830
Grandma always told us to
help those in need, didn't she?

1151
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:15,450
That's right.

1152
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,930
Everyone! Please  listen to me!

1153
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,400
Yummy.

1154
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,000
Can't you help a little too, Naomi-san?

1155
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,450
I can't make food  this good.

1156
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,250
What time is it?

1157
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,500
It's time!

1158
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:33,800
Yumi-san!

1159
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,150
Kazuma!  Change your clothes, will you?

1160
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:41,050
Later.

1161
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,100
Kazuma-kun looks like
he's  really King Kazma.

1162
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,100
That child used  to be quite weak.

1163
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,520
He learned Shaolin kung fu from his

1164
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:53,500
grandfather Mansuke  in Niigata
through OZ all the way from Nagoya.

1165
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:55,450
So that's why he  called him Master.

1166
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:00,900
Don't touch anything!

1167
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,600
I mean it!

1168
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:03,790
We're not touching nothing!

1169
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,210
We're just looking!

1170
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,400
Keeping it cool's gonna be the problem.

1171
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,150
We don't have an air conditioner.

1172
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,930
I've got lots of ice in the boat.

1173
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:12,800
Follow me.

1174
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,900
LCD's response times are too slow.

1175
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,240
Do you have any  HD CRT monitors?

1176
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:19,000
Course I do.

1177
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:25,450
Just what kind of people is
Natsuki-sempai's family made of?

1178
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:26,720
We're just a normal civilian family.

1179
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:29,440
A 200 teraFLOPS supercomputer,

1180
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:31,600
and a 100 gig military-grade
 connection line.

1181
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,020
You're telling me that a normal
family has that kinda stuff?

1182
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:35,550
I want to send a challenge.

1183
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,000
A challenge?

1184
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:39,010
Sent by  King Kazma.

1185
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:42,100
"Don't expect it to
be  so easy this time."

1186
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,900
And how do you know that?

1187
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,330
Because I'm King Kazma.

1188
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:47,750
Tell me another one.

1189
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,200
Wait, really?

1190
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,600
<i>Challenge</i>

1191
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,840
<i>Come to the OZ Coliseum today
at noon (JST). King Kazma</i>

1192
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:00,830
Master.

1193
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,500
Do you think I can win?

1194
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,140
You're all grown up now.

1195
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:07,300
You can decide the  outcome by yourself.

1196
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,310
Grown up? But I'm only in middle school.

1197
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,650
You'll be a big brother soon.

1198
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:13,530
I didn't choose to be.

1199
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:15,330
And a little sister at that...

1200
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:18,000
It's not so bad  having siblings.

1201
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,900
Even though you steal
each other's snacks,

1202
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,210
fight every day,

1203
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:24,900
get sick of even  seeing their faces...

1204
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,550
One minute left!

1205
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:28,950
I'm ready.

1206
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,160
Me too.

1207
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,160
We can win this time.

1208
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,500
Grit your teeth.

1209
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,800
Let's go together.

1210
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,600
The finals are now beginning.

1211
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,620
Ueda High is up against the
favorites Matsushou Academy!

1212
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:45,300
If Ueda High can win this
 match, they'll advance

1213
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:49,730
to the nationals for the
first  time in 24 years.

1214
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,770
But Matsushou's quite strong.

1215
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:55,150
Will Ueda be  able to pull it off?

1216
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:59,110
Grandma, please watch  over Ryouhei!

1217
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:01,900
And we're just  about to start!

1218
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:39,950
He came!

1219
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,290
Yeah!

1220
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,900
He's fast...  he's really fast!

1221
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,730
I can do it.

1222
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:26,800
Don't let him run!

1223
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,030
Get him to the trap!

1224
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,400
I can take  care of him by myself!

1225
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:04,480
He's controlling the  stolen avatars.

1226
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:05,970
He can do  that?

1227
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,990
Don't do it, Kazuma-kun!

1228
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,900
Run!

1229
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:31,640
Master!

1230
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:33,600
I'll keep him occupied, run!

1231
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:40,240
Master!

1232
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,930
I'm fine,  get him to the trap!

1233
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,600
Got him.

1234
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:01,290
Sakuma!

1235
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,710
Right on schedule!

1236
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,200
We got him, Grandmother!

1237
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,750
Kazuma did it!

1238
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,700
Yorihiko-san's group! It's your turn!

1239
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,350
Leave it to us.

1240
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:09,200
We've been gaming for 30
years! Don't underestimate us!

1241
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,600
Even though we haven't been
playing as much lately...

1242
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:14,250
Our skills haven't rusted a bit!

1243
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:39,350
We did it!

1244
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,120
Is that daddy's avatar?

1245
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:44,000
I want that one too!

1246
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,310
Papa's awesome!

1247
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:46,750
Papa...

1248
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:51,300
Bottom of the eighth, and Ueda
High is giving a stunning show!

1249
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,050
Yumi-san...

1250
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:54,100
Like a rat in a trap.

1251
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,660
It's just a matter  of time now.

1252
01:14:58,830 --> 01:14:59,800
What's happening?

1253
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:18,000
What's this?

1254
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Something's wrong with the stage!

1255
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,800
What's going on?

1256
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:22,600
Tasuke-san, behind you!

1257
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,350
Behind you?

1258
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,800
What?

1259
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:29,160
Hot!

1260
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:31,400
It's about to go critical!

1261
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:33,940
Where'd all the ice go?

1262
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,100
We had lots more than this...

1263
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,240
Shouta-nii took it.

1264
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,700
What?!

1265
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,420
Is that cool enough, Grandma?

1266
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,400
They say today's  the
hottest day of summer.

1267
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,430
Top of the ninth, and Ueda's pitcher

1268
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,600
Jinnouchi is  beginning to crack.

1269
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,300
He looks very tired, doesn't he?

1270
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:00,540
Ryouhei!

1271
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,150
And Matsushou  continues
their offensive!

1272
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,780
These are all the 
avatars he's absorbed!

1273
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,990
More than 400 million!

1274
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:20,550
Kazuma-kun, run!

1275
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:21,720
Kazuma-kun!

1276
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:46,350
It's so hot that Grandma
 might start to rot,

1277
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,000
and here you guys  are playing games.

1278
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,950
...all because of you...

1279
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,700
Huh? What was that?

1280
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:54,450
This is all your fault!

1281
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,650
This is because you...!

1282
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:58,850
Stop, Kazuma-kun!

1283
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:00,350
What's the deal!

1284
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,020
Are you okay, Shouta-nii?

1285
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:04,360
Everything's gone to 
hell since you showed up!

1286
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,840
Natsuki getting all weird!

1287
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:07,100
Grandma died!

1288
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,100
Now Kazuma's hitting me!

1289
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,370
Shouta-nii...

1290
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:13,800
Wha, what's happening?

1291
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:21,800
The world clock is...

1292
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:24,600
going haywire.

1293
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,840
What kind of countdown is this?

1294
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:03,270
Why...

1295
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,400
These are nuclear reactors.

1296
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,350
This is bad.

1297
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,150
The American military's secret
communication lines are going wild.

1298
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,750
Japan's planetary probe Arawashi

1299
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:19,590
is plummeting to Earth, 
completely out of control.

1300
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:24,900
Arawashi can change its
course through GPS coordinates.

1301
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:27,700
If that thing is in
control  of Arawashi...!

1302
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:30,150
Then this countdown is...

1303
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:34,130
It's telling the time
 until Arawashi falls

1304
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,800
onto one of the world's 
500 plus nuclear facilities.

1305
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,900
What an  exhilarating match!

1306
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,320
The finals are going  into overtime!

1307
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:45,640
<i>Save us! Save the world!</i>

1308
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,750
The road to the nationals is
 indeed fraught with peril!

1309
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:52,180
The pressure on these high
schoolers must be incredible!

1310
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:56,450
As you'll recall, Ueda's pitcher Jinnouchi
allowed 30 hits in yesterday's semi-finals.

1311
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:59,280
Today, he must pitch 15
extended innings on his own.

1312
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,700
Ryouhei!

1313
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:05,200
Today, in the final match, will his
mind and body be up to the challenge?

1314
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,140
<i>To my family</i>

1315
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:19,390
This is...

1316
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,050
Grandma's...

1317
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,130
Wait, Natsuki!

1318
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:29,780
Natsuki!

1319
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:31,550
- Wait! 
- Where are you going?

1320
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,620
Everyone!

1321
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,050
A game?

1322
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,200
It's playing a game
 with people's lives?

1323
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,750
You...

1324
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:41,300
You've got to be kidding me.

1325
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,920
This is all just a  game to him.

1326
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,900
It has no ideals,  no hatred.

1327
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:49,750
The Americans are  frantic right now.

1328
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,850
They never imagined 
that their test could have

1329
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,260
lead to this.

1330
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:59,400
An object with a diameter of 1
meter falling at 7 km per second

1331
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,200
packs the same force as a
meteor or ballistic missile.

1332
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:07,000
If it falls on a power plant
and there's nuclear fallout,

1333
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,850
the damage caused will be unimaginable.

1334
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:12,860
Then what do we do?

1335
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:14,000
It's managed to steal  38%
of the currently existing

1336
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:22,000
King Kazma, kill that monster!

1337
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,400
number of accounts  on OZ, 412 million!

1338
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:21,330
We have to find the one among those
that can set Arawashi's GPS coordinates.

1339
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,000
In 2 hours.

1340
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:27,950
How're we going to find one
account among 400 million?!

1341
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:31,100
But there's no other way.

1342
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,260
Kazuma.

1343
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:36,650
What's  going on?

1344
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:40,500
You're just talking
 about a game, right?

1345
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,460
Right?

1346
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:02,450
Don't go, King!

1347
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,250
It's useless!

1348
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,300
Shut up!

1349
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:32,550
Grandma...

1350
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,400
I'm sorry.

1351
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:39,550
I couldn't save mom...

1352
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:44,550
I couldn't save my little sister.

1353
01:23:53,740 --> 01:24:00,200
Wabisuke's the only one who
could do something now, but...

1354
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:04,550
There's no way  he'd come back.

1355
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,200
We haven't lost yet.

1356
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:17,800
Kenji-kun.

1357
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:19,400
We lost.

1358
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,650
No we didn't.

1359
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,900
I told you, we lost!

1360
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,700
I'm telling you, we haven't.

1361
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:28,550
There's got to be some other
way to solve this problem.

1362
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:29,950
What do you mean?

1363
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:31,280
This ain't math.

1364
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,020
It's the same.

1365
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:33,600
You can't solve an
equation by giving up.

1366
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,350
We just haven't  found the answer yet.

1367
01:24:36,830 --> 01:24:38,200
You...

1368
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:44,950
Natsuki!

1369
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:12,850
How'd you find this  address, Natsuki?

1370
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:13,750
Where are you right now?

1371
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:14,730
What's it to you?

1372
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:17,570
And how'd you find out 
the password to my cell?

1373
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:18,350
Come back!

1374
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:20,900
Grandma told you to do this, didn't she.

1375
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:21,910
Listen.

1376
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,240
I'm not going back.

1377
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:26,050
Not as long as she's  still there.

1378
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:28,120
Please, listen to me.

1379
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:31,200
I never would've gone back if
I'd known it was her birthday.

1380
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,350
Ojisan!

1381
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:33,100
Come now!

1382
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,000
You don't even know  what's happened!

1383
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,550
What's the matter.

1384
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,000
Grandma  passed away.

1385
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:55,700
She had a weak heart.

1386
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:59,600
Mansaku-ojisan couldn't help her
in time because of OZ acting up.

1387
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,400
Grandma's...

1388
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,250
Grandma's dead?

1389
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:09,000
You were lying when you said you
didn't know it was her birthday.

1390
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,600
The password  was August 1st!

1391
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:16,000
You came back for  her
birthday, didn't you?

1392
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,500
Didn't you!

1393
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,700
Please...

1394
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:20,920
Come back just once
 and bid her goodbye!

1395
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,200
To my family:

1396
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,150
First, I must ask you to calm down.

1397
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,430
It's important for everyone
to compose themselves.

1398
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:57,750
I want the funeral to 
be a small, family affair,

1399
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:00,560
and I wish for all of you to
go about your lives as normal.

1400
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,920
I don't have anything material
to leave behind for you,

1401
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:06,630
but the people I've come to
know over the course of my life

1402
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:11,390
will do their best to help
you get along. Don't worry.

1403
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:15,100
Everyone, work diligently and
live your lives to the fullest.

1404
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:16,940
And...

1405
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:28,840
And if Wabisuke  should ever come home,

1406
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:34,400
though it's anyone's guess as to when he'll
come after having been gone for 10 years,

1407
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:40,340
if he should ever come back
home, I'm sure he'll be hungry,

1408
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:49,180
so feed him well with vegetables from
the fields, and the grapes and pears.

1409
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:55,050
I can remember the  day I first met him.

1410
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:59,230
His ears looked so much like his
father's that I was surprised.

1411
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:02,650
As we walked along the fields,

1412
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:06,380
when I told him, "You're going to
be part of my family from now on,"

1413
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:11,700
he didn't reply, but
didn't  let go of my hand.

1414
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,540
I felt as though my happiness
that he was now my son

1415
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:20,380
was reaching him  through that.

1416
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:26,050
Family should never 
let go of one another.

1417
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,340
You must never admit defeat in life.

1418
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:33,300
And though you may come
upon hard and painful times,

1419
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:38,550
I want you all to sit 
together and eat as a family.

1420
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:40,560
The worst things in this world

1421
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:45,050
are being hungry  and being alone.

1422
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:54,020
I was glad to  have had you all.

1423
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:01,850
Thank you.

1424
01:29:01,850 --> 01:29:03,040
Goodbye.

1425
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:19,920
Ojisan!

1426
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:23,800
Grandma! Grandma!

1427
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,900
Wabisuke, pay your 
respects to Grandmother.

1428
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:30,800
And after that...

1429
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:32,800
let's all have lunch together.

1430
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,040
Ryouhei, you can do it!

1431
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,380
Yumi-san, come!

1432
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,540
But I'm still watching!

1433
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:01,500
Grandma, I'm home.

1434
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:03,300
It's going for a nuclear power plant?

1435
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,400
That's horrible!

1436
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,000
Yeah, this is an emergency.

1437
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:07,500
Can we sit around and eat like this?

1438
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,050
It was part of her will.

1439
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:10,400
It's really strong, right?

1440
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:13,050
In summer of 1615, 
at the battle of Osaka,

1441
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:15,910
we fought against Tokugawa's
vast army of 15,000.

1442
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,490
But we lost!

1443
01:30:17,490 --> 01:30:20,200
We can't fight just because
 it looks like we'll win

1444
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,830
and run just because it
 looks like we'll lose.

1445
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:25,330
We've fought through
 losing wars before.

1446
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,500
Every time.

1447
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,840
Our family was so stupid!

1448
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,040
Right, and we're the 
descendants of those people.

1449
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,880
Yeah, and I'm one of  those idiots, eh.

1450
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,000
Still, we've got some
 kind of plan, right?

1451
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:38,390
I'm going to try and 
dismantle him remotely.

1452
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,800
I don't know whether  or
not I'll have the time.

1453
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,390
This all came about because
of the stolen accounts.

1454
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,470
We've got another plan 
that'll work in our favor.

1455
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:48,850
Work in our favor?

1456
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:50,850
You said he liked  playing games, right?

1457
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:52,540
It's this.

1458
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:56,600
You've got one hour left!

1459
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:06,630
Welcome to the OZ Casino Stage.

1460
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,800
Do you really want other
people's accounts so badly?

1461
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:24,300
Fine. I'll give you mine.

1462
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:28,100
But you have to win  against me first!

1463
01:31:29,950 --> 01:31:31,900
Hanafuda has been selected.

1464
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:33,720
What will the wager be?

1465
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:36,200
My wager will be...

1466
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,800
my family!

1467
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:43,040
We'll play with our
accounts  on the line!

1468
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:47,270
All of your accounts  are in my hands.

1469
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:49,250
Grandma, please watch over us!

1470
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:52,500
Hanafuda, huh. Suits our family.

1471
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:56,190
Wabisuke-san, I want you to work on
destroying it while they go at it.

1472
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:59,340
But do you think he'll
agree to this match?

1473
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,800
We only number 20 people,
including Sakuma-kun.

1474
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:04,470
Isn't that a bit small of a wager?

1475
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,570
Shut up!

1476
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:08,240
Small or not,  these are our lives!

1477
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:09,700
Bring it on!

1478
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:11,500
Let's fight!

1479
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:13,230
He'll come.

1480
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:14,540
No doubt about it.

1481
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:17,100
A player has joined the game.

1482
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:18,700
He's here!

1483
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,200
Fight, Natsuki!

1484
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:22,720
The fate of the world's  in your hands!

1485
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:25,540
Casino rules  apply to this stage.

1486
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:28,500
The pot doubles  with
each call of koi koi.

1487
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:31,780
The winner of the  game takes all.

1488
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:34,590
Deciding initiative.

1489
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,640
Natsuki-san will go first.

1490
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:38,630
Now, the game will begin.

1491
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:45,320
That one!

1492
01:32:45,330 --> 01:32:46,260
The cherry petals!

1493
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:47,110
No!

1494
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:47,870
That one!

1495
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,270
Quiet down a little!

1496
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:51,730
Blue ribbons!

1497
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:52,730
Koi koi?

1498
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:53,770
Koi koi!

1499
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:55,170
Koi koi!

1500
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:57,120
Natsuki-san, koi koi.

1501
01:32:58,330 --> 01:32:59,100
3 bright.

1502
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:00,220
Koi koi?

1503
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:03,000
Ribbon. Koi koi?

1504
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,170
Natsuki-san wins.

1505
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:06,330
All right!

1506
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:07,500
This is great.

1507
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,080
He's completely new to this.

1508
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:13,020
Don't take us lightly, we've been
training under Grandma since we were kids!

1509
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:15,750
26 accounts have  been transferred.

1510
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:17,970
26 out of 400 million.

1511
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:20,010
Next round!

1512
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,930
Natsuki-san, you have 
initiative. Set the wager.

1513
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:25,120
3 bright.

1514
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:25,430
Viewing the cherry blossoms.

1515
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:27,630
4 bright.

1516
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:30,240
Five 10s.

1517
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,120
Rainy 4 bright.

1518
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:32,400

Boar-Deer-Butterfly.

1519
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:35,570
Natsuki-san wins.

1520
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:38,600
Natsuki-san raises  the bet.

1521
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:39,240
Koi koi!

1522
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:41,200
Koi koi!

1523
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:42,860
Koi koi!

1524
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:44,960
Natsuki-sempai's incredible.

1525
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:48,400
She's already gotten
 back 300,000 avatars.

1526
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:51,290
But we still don't have
 the account we need!

1527
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:52,120
Wabisuke-san!

1528
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:04,700
- Viewing the cherry blossoms. 
- No!

1529
01:34:04,710 --> 01:34:07,220
Unknown-san requests  a showdown.

1530
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:08,860
Natsuki-san loses.

1531
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:10,940
The wager will be transferred.

1532
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:21,900
Natsuki-san has 74 OZ
 accounts remaining.

1533
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:25,090
This is bad! Half an hour's gone by!

1534
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:27,620
You do not have  enough
wager to continue play.

1535
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,740
Will you end the game?

1536
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:33,700
You do not have enough
wager to continue play.

1537
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,750
Will you end the game?

1538
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,900
<i>Natsuki, please use my  account.</i>

1539
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,400
It's a boy living in Germany.

1540
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,120
Who?

1541
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:13,500
Is he a fan of Kazuma's?

1542
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,540
I don't know.

1543
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:31,950
Unbelievable.

1544
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:44,940
This represents 13.837%
of OZ's total subscription!

1545
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:48,180
More than 150 million  accounts!

1546
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,700
Why're they...

1547
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,900
It must be because  Natsuki's pretty.

1548
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,350
<i>I'll give you my account</i>

1549
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:59,600
<i>so please save</i>

1550
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:03,000
<i>my precious family.</i>

1551
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:48,720
What's with the light show?

1552
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:52,550
OZ's guardian spirits have
given Natsuki a rare item.

1553
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:54,890
I don't know what's going on, but...

1554
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:56,720
Thank you!

1555
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,150
Unknown-san raises  the bet.

1556
01:37:04,830 --> 01:37:07,200
1 point is  10 million avatars.

1557
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:08,040
10 million!

1558
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:10,050
He wants to end it.

1559
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:11,940
Let the game begin.

1560
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,000
3 bright.

1561
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,900

Boar-Deer-Butterfly.

1562
01:37:24,390 --> 01:37:25,200
Koi!

1563
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:27,590
Red poetry ribbons.

1564
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,250
Koi!

1565
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:30,970
Rainy 4 bright.

1566
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:31,690
Koi!

1567
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:33,090
Koi!

1568
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:34,600
Koi!

1569
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:41,750
Go!

1570
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:43,000
Natsuki, get him!

1571
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,200
Do it!

1572
01:37:44,530 --> 01:37:46,000
Finish it, sempai!

1573
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:46,940
Kill him!

1574
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:01,330
5 bright.

1575
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:05,450
Natsuki-san wins.  Accounts
will be transferred.

1576
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:27,500
It...

1577
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:29,090
It...

1578
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:31,350
stopped.

1579
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:39,300
All right!

1580
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:40,890
We did it!

1581
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:43,150
Hooray!

1582
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:46,890
Sempai!

1583
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:49,850
Kenji-kun.

1584
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:51,000
I...

1585
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:52,250
I...

1586
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:56,360
I did it!

1587
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:57,490
Wha– Sempai!

1588
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:01,300
Wait!

1589
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,230
Something's wrong.

1590
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:03,240
Huh?

1591
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:06,830
The countdown  isn't stopping!

1592
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:08,000
Huuuh!?

1593
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,500
That makes no sense!

1594
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,970
The world clocks everywhere
else  have already stopped.

1595
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:13,650
Why only here?

1596
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:36,490
He's going to drop  Arawashi here?

1597
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,150
Looks like it!

1598
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:40,420
Are you shitting me?!

1599
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:41,900
Haven't you pulled that thing apart yet?

1600
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:43,120
I'm trying!

1601
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:45,300
10 minutes!

1602
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,290
It's too late to change
 the thing's course now.

1603
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:49,150
Everyone stay calm  and evacuate.

1604
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:50,980
Tell the neighbors.

1605
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:52,950
We don't know how bad
 the damage will be.

1606
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:53,770
Let's go!

1607
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:57,340
Is our house gonna blow up?

1608
01:40:57,850 --> 01:40:59,270
We'd be lucky if it
ended with the house!

1609
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:00,900
Grandma, what do we do with this?

1610
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,390
Take it with you, of course!

1611
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:04,600
Mother, the bankbook!

1612
01:41:07,530 --> 01:41:08,480
Natsuki!  Move it!

1613
01:41:08,990 --> 01:41:09,560
Natsuki!

1614
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:15,780
Did he leave any logs 
behind in the control sector?

1615
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:16,690
Let me see!

1616
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:18,150
Are you still trying to do something?

1617
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:20,150
They said you can't change its course.

1618
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:23,910
Riichi-san, you said that Arawashi's course
could be changed with GPS coordinates, right?

1619
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:24,600
Yeah.

1620
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:28,830
We can send its GPS false information
just like he did yesterday!

1621
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:30,040
It's here.

1622
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:31,370
You can see its  footprints!

1623
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:34,020
If you induce an error  in
the landing information...

1624
01:41:34,430 --> 01:41:36,130
You might be able  to
change its course a bit!

1625
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:39,470
But I don't know if it'll work
or not, so everyone get clear.

1626
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:40,490
Kenji-kun.

1627
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:43,180
Hurry, you all!

1628
01:41:43,190 --> 01:41:44,260
Hurry!

1629
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:45,930
We haven't lost yet!

1630
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:49,740
What happened here?

1631
01:41:51,570 --> 01:41:52,650
This is it!

1632
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:56,190
Why...?

1633
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:58,250
The password's been changed.

1634
01:41:58,490 --> 01:41:59,820
He's trying to stop you!

1635
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:01,490
That can't be...

1636
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,100
Calm down!  We're right here with ya!

1637
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:07,540
You can do it.

1638
01:42:07,590 --> 01:42:08,330
Do it!

1639
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:10,200
Okay!

1640
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:26,350
Do your best!

1641
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,000
Okay!

1642
01:42:31,650 --> 01:42:32,730
It's open!

1643
01:42:33,150 --> 01:42:34,150
That was fast.

1644
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:38,570
We're locked out!

1645
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:39,300
Damn it!

1646
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:40,350
Once more!

1647
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:44,590
Kazuma!

1648
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,540
I lowered his defense  stats to zero!

1649
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:48,330
Blow him to bits!

1650
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,000
Off you go!

1651
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:03,470
Master!

1652
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,350
2 minutes left!

1653
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:23,030
It's open!

1654
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:27,850
Not again!

1655
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:46,100
He's doing the calculations in his head?

1656
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:49,680
1 minute!

1657
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:06,350
Stop getting in the waaaay!

1658
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:26,250
Please let this work!

1659
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:35,150
It's a hot spring!

1660
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:36,490
A hot spring!

1661
01:45:37,170 --> 01:45:39,330
A hot spring appeared!

1662
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:42,600
Ueda High pulls  off
a miraculous comeback!

1663
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:47,150
Advancing to the nationals
for the first time in 24 years,

1664
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:49,730
After a grueling 15 overtime innings,

1665
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:54,250
the mound is swarmed 
with victorious players!

1666
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:57,670
Shouts of joy are  filling the stadium!

1667
01:46:09,610 --> 01:46:13,150
Happy birthday to you,

1668
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:17,750
happy birthday to you.

1669
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:24,210
Happy birthday, dear Grandma.

1670
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:31,800
Happy birthday to you!

1671
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:34,590
Happy birthday!

1672
01:46:46,030 --> 01:46:47,250
Natsuki!

1673
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:50,940
Come on, don't cry, Ryouhei.

1674
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,030
It moved! That's weird!

1675
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:02,120
She's saying, "Thank you."

1676
01:47:04,970 --> 01:47:05,710
Dad!

1677
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,920
You did good.

1678
01:47:22,030 --> 01:47:23,930
I saw Wabisuke-san on the news.

1679
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:26,900
He came forward  by himself, didn't he?

1680
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:32,800
However, the professor only
designed the A.I. Love Machine,

1681
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,740
and the American military is
responsible for turning it loose.

1682
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:41,700
Though thankfully there
 were no casualties,

1683
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:45,500
it is clear that the organizations
responsible for this incident

1684
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,620
will have to take 
responsibility for their actions.

1685
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,520
Ah, right. Tell Kenji

1686
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,500
he doesn't have to
come back for a while.

1687
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,700
He says you don't have to come back.

1688
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:54,990
No, but I have to.

1689
01:47:56,730 --> 01:47:58,567
How about you two marry for real?

1690
01:47:58,950 --> 01:48:00,350
But you have to start
dating first, right?

1691
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:01,700
What do you think?

1692
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:03,950
If you say you  like her, I'll kill you!

1693
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:05,250
Do you hate Natsuki?

1694
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:06,850
I'll kill you if you  say that, too!

1695
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:08,730
I-I love her!

1696
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:10,690
You bastard!

1697
01:48:13,330 --> 01:48:14,350
I'm glad.

1698
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,820
Thank you.

1699
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:21,330
Kiss, kiss!

1700
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:23,120
Hey, you!

1701
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:24,300
I'll arrest ya!

1702
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:37,650
My nose!

1703
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:49,700
What a wimp!
