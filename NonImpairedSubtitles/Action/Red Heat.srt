1
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:45,530
Abdul Elijah says we're in business.
Get the capital in safe place, okay?

2
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:49,598
Meet me back here 3:00. Bring me a key.
We go check the color of your green.

3
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:53,945
Your shipment's on its way. You have a
small item for me. I give you a courier.

4
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,508
Bless Abdul Elijah
and the brotherhood.

5
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,068
Nice doing business, comrade.

6
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:41,029
Oh! Attention!

7
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:44,608
Fun bag patrol.
Double bogies, 11:00.

8
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,686
Whew, Christ!

9
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,914
You think she bought those?
I don't think so.

10
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:54,116
I think those
are definitely home grown.

11
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,744
Art!

12
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:58,591
Just an opinion.

13
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,091
Jesus!

14
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:06,342
-Guy's gotta be dead not to notice that.
-What's the matter with you?

15
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:08,350
I'm a man. I got needs.

16
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,530
We're on the job. Come on.

17
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:13,314
We oughta arrest her.

18
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:22,276
- What'd you squeeze him with?
- Caught him packin' on parole.

19
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:24,516
Gave him a choice:
Whisper in my ear...

20
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:26,953
or I turn him into Joliet Prison
for five years.

21
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:29,058
He tipped you to
a big cleanhead deal?

22
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,644
Don't tell me we're popping cleanheads.
I hate the cleanheads!

23
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:34,919
You're this close
to losing your job.

24
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:38,151
Can you give us a second, Charlie?

25
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:40,074
Yeah, all right.

26
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:44,199
You're not helping yourself.

27
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:46,722
This is a good tip.
I got it from my guy Streak.

28
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:52,098
All right. Come on, let's go.

29
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,383
Freeze! Police! Hands up!

30
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:08,647
Shut up!

31
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,888
You ain't got shit!

32
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,225
Follow me. You have the right
to remain silent.

33
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:24,359
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

34
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:33,258
Outside stairwell!

35
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,487
Freeze, motherfucker!

36
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,455
Don't get nervous.
I do this for a living.

37
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:10,024
You look like Marvin Hagler.

38
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:12,039
I lost money on Hagler!

39
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:31,408
Hey! How long you gonna be in there?
You're not even using the goddamn phone!

40
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:33,617
Jerk.

41
00:19:57,144 --> 00:19:58,965
America.

42
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,276
America.

43
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:02,930
Chicago. Gangsters.

44
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,237
- How you doing, honey?
- Blow yourself.

45
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:21,335
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It's good thinking.

46
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:24,956
Should be out any second.

47
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:27,640
He's going through customs
right now.

48
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,223
You read the report Stobbs wrote
on the cleanhead bust?

49
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:35,255
- He says your performance was adequate.
- Adequate. Jesus Christ! What a jerk!

50
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,628
It's a personality thing.

51
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:39,604
Stobbs just doesn't like yours.

52
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,214
Ten to one he doesn't speak English.

53
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:55,096
- Captain Danko.
- Yes.

54
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:58,714
I'm Detective Sergeant Gallagher,
Chicago Police Department.

55
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,855
- Glad to meet you.
- Thank you.

56
00:22:00,926 --> 00:22:04,276
This is my partner,
Detective Sergeant Ridzik.

57
00:22:07,552 --> 00:22:09,919
- First time in Chicago?
- Yes.

58
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:12,057
You have a nice flight?

59
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:13,624
Yes, fine.

60
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:16,666
- You hungry?
- No.

61
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,046
Thirsty?

62
00:22:18,113 --> 00:22:22,455
Hate to break this up, but I'm parked
in a red zone. No offense.

63
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:26,109
We got a car waiting outside
for you.

64
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:29,177
It's a half-hour drive
to the city.

65
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:32,152
It's a nice drive.
You'll enjoy it.

66
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:34,776
Nice night.

67
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,422
Been real hot lately. Nothing hotter
than Chicago in August.

68
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,207
It's the humidity
that gets to you.

69
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:46,242
Humidity. You know,
moisture in the air.

70
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:51,232
How's it been in Moscow?

71
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:52,957
Hot.

72
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:55,067
No moisture.

73
00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:57,920
Where'd you learn
to speak English so well?

74
00:22:57,987 --> 00:22:59,874
Army.

75
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:03,071
Compulsory training.
Language school in Kiev.

76
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,435
Oh, yeah. That's like
in Chicken Kiev.

77
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:09,370
We had that at my sister's wedding.

78
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,890
Viktor Rosta must've pissed off
a lot of commissars...

79
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:17,437
for them to send someone
all this way to baby-sit him home.

80
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:20,160
What did he do?
Pee on the Kremlin?

81
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:26,565
I gotta apologize
for my partner, Captain.

82
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,833
He's just naturally suspicious.

83
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:30,527
Did you arrest Viktor?

84
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:34,788
- Me? It was patrolmen.
- Where?

85
00:23:34,854 --> 00:23:37,603
Right near his hotel,
The Garvin.

86
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,670
It's a breeding ground for pushers,
pimps, prostitutes.

87
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:42,881
Take me there.

88
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,853
We got you booked
at the Executive House.

89
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:48,131
Please. Garvin.

90
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:57,439
You sure you wanna stay here?
It's horrible. You have a choice.

91
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:59,072
I stay here.

92
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:02,624
- If you're on a budget--
- Thank you.

93
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:04,769
I will be fine.

94
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,747
You're the boss.

95
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:11,678
I'll pick you up
at 9:00 in the morning.

96
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,583
Nice talking to you, Captain.

97
00:24:21,385 --> 00:24:24,233
- What do you think?
- I think he's a jerk.

98
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:34,469
- Danko.
- You're welcome.

99
00:24:44,394 --> 00:24:48,191
Put your name in the big book
right there.

100
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:53,384
You had man here called "Rosta."

101
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,623
Viktor Rosta.

102
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:58,473
- A Russian?
- Soviet.

103
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,873
I want same room.

104
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,467
Are you Russian too?

105
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:09,803
Nice going.

106
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,153
It's 302.

107
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:17,260
Right up those stairs.

108
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:08,004
Capitalism.

109
00:26:28,497 --> 00:26:30,636
This is our booking area.

110
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:35,534
Looks like a major crime wave
just hit, right?

111
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:39,115
When I first got here
when I was first assigned here...

112
00:26:39,187 --> 00:26:41,520
I thought all hell
had broken loose.

113
00:26:42,738 --> 00:26:46,632
Nope. It was just
a typical Monday morning.

114
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:48,878
Is that a Russian cop uniform?

115
00:26:48,946 --> 00:26:51,914
Looks like a glorified postman
or something out of World War Two.

116
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:54,638
- Be respectful to our guest, Audrey.
- Yes, sir.

117
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,513
Not king.

118
00:26:58,387 --> 00:27:00,329
Checkmate in two moves.

119
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:02,956
Use bishop to queen four.

120
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:06,257
Thanks for your advice, comrade,
but I think I got it covered.

121
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:08,785
This way, Captain.

122
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:11,763
The nerve of that guy.

123
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:15,627
Captain Danko, Moscow Militia.

124
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,569
This is Commander Donnelly,
chief of this district.

125
00:27:18,644 --> 00:27:21,841
Thanks, Tom. The Captain
will be with you in a minute.

126
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,938
This is an extradition order.
It only requires your signature.

127
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:32,624
He ran a red light.
No driver's license.

128
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:36,142
The officer found a gun in
his glove box, so he brought him in.

129
00:27:36,214 --> 00:27:38,635
We shook him down.
Then he refused to speak English.

130
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:43,183
When we found the cyrillic writing
tattoo, we figured he was one of yours.

131
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,601
Viktor did not ask
for political asylum?

132
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,361
I think he wants to go home.

133
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:55,509
Audrey, go get Sergeant Ridzik.

134
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,429
Right.

135
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:07,120
Stress management.
You watch the fishes.

136
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:08,980
You water the plants.

137
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:12,212
Special breathing exercises.
Monitor your blood pressure.

138
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,646
Listen to pleasant sounds.

139
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:18,712
Relax.

140
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:22,224
Personally, I think it
may all be a pile of shit!

141
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:26,094
But when you're facing a bypass,
you stop asking questions.

142
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:29,906
Look...

143
00:28:29,978 --> 00:28:34,232
just out of curiosity, and since
I figure cops are cops everywhere...

144
00:28:35,768 --> 00:28:38,322
how do you Soviets deal
with all the stress?

145
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,370
Vodka.

146
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,505
Yes, sir.

147
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:48,760
I want you to ride with Gallagher
and the Captain to the city jail.

148
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:52,306
Make sure he signs this form
before they go to the airport.

149
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:54,834
Then bring the top copy back.

150
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:58,039
Just bring the top form
back to me.

151
00:28:58,907 --> 00:29:01,077
- Yes, sir.
- That'll make it official.

152
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:05,009
So long, Captain.
Nice doing business with you.

153
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,898
- Gallagher! Taxi service.
- Right.

154
00:29:33,757 --> 00:29:38,068
You can tell they're old buddies.
Body language is a beautiful thing.

155
00:29:39,806 --> 00:29:42,107
We are ready.

156
00:29:42,173 --> 00:29:43,734
Yes, sir.

157
00:30:02,271 --> 00:30:05,817
- Do you know what this key opens?
- Looks like a locker key.

158
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,090
Why don't you ask your bud?

159
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:11,614
You try it.

160
00:30:16,512 --> 00:30:19,230
Where is the locker...

161
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:22,711
that this key opens?

162
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,088
- What'd he say?
- He say...

163
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,227
"Go and kiss your mother's behind."

164
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,595
You son of a bitch!
Come here!

165
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:39,520
Motherfucker!

166
00:30:39,586 --> 00:30:41,441
- Take it easy!
- I'm fine!

167
00:30:45,314 --> 00:30:47,933
- Take it easy.
- I'm fine. Happens all the time.

168
00:30:48,002 --> 00:30:51,001
Every day someone tells me
to go fuck my mother's ass.

169
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,153
- Have you seen my mother's ass?
- No, I haven't.

170
00:30:56,227 --> 00:30:58,137
Well, you'd want to fuck it too.

171
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:07,648
He shouldn't have said that
about my mom.

172
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:11,032
What do you care? It's not your case.
It's not my case.

173
00:31:11,107 --> 00:31:14,141
- It's not even an American case.
- Right, right.

174
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:17,954
We're just an escort service here.
Pull back on your emotions.

175
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,289
How can I let what he said pass?

176
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:22,876
Find a middle ground.

177
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,890
This way, clown.

178
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,244
All right, I'm outta here.

179
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,651
Look, Captain,
have a good flight back.

180
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:46,849
If you get a chance to flush
this turd down the toilet...

181
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:49,339
do it over the Pole.

182
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:52,862
By the way, you were right about
that chess move. I was dead in two.

183
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:55,302
It was obvious.

184
00:32:02,694 --> 00:32:06,437
Forgive Ridzik, Captain.
He's been having a hard time lately.

185
00:32:06,503 --> 00:32:09,221
- Put himself in a jam--
- I try to forget Ridzik.

186
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:19,391
- Hey, Bernie.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:22,563
Give me a Sun Times and
a Racing Action tip sheet.

188
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:24,541
You got a winner?

189
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:41,221
Move!

190
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:43,176
- Come on, let's go!
- The key!

191
00:32:47,594 --> 00:32:48,675
Come on, man!

192
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:51,266
Let's go! Let's move!

193
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:01,863
- How's he doing, Doctor?
- It's still early.

194
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:04,968
There's no fracture,
but Danko does have a concussion.

195
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,625
We're gonna need him
to make a full statement.

196
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:10,956
I don't think you should expect
much out of him today.

197
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:13,062
Thank you very much.

198
00:34:32,048 --> 00:34:34,470
Gallagher didn't even
get a shot off.

199
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:37,033
I think it was the cleanheads
who did it.

200
00:34:37,105 --> 00:34:40,683
That's possible. They all walked
yesterday morning. Illegal warrant.

201
00:34:40,753 --> 00:34:42,728
Even the guy with the shotgun?

202
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:45,901
Walked right out the door
with a handshake from the judge.

203
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,627
- Shit.
- Listen to this.

204
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:51,408
This guy you shot there,
according to his l.D., he's Russian.

205
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:53,197
Can you believe that?

206
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,878
I'm sorry, but the police department
will have to bear with us.

207
00:36:08,951 --> 00:36:11,766
Captain Danko should remain
incommunicado.

208
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:14,701
The Russians got a chance
to talk to him. Why?

209
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:18,452
They were the closest thing to family
and they weren't gonna interrogate.

210
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,498
How did you get that piece
through customs?

211
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:27,470
Diplomatic immunity.

212
00:36:27,544 --> 00:36:31,538
Great. That restores my faith
in airport security.

213
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:34,957
You're not supposed to have
that gun, Danko.

214
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:37,400
I'll tell you what, though.

215
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:40,148
Tell me what's going on with Viktor
and you keep the gun.

216
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:42,421
Take it.

217
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:44,561
Come on, gimme a break
with this shit.

218
00:36:44,632 --> 00:36:48,823
Maybe this Russian bully stuff
works on a chessboard, but not here.

219
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:50,832
You retire the uniform?

220
00:36:50,905 --> 00:36:52,881
I am now undercover.

221
00:36:52,954 --> 00:36:54,809
Undercover?

222
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:57,235
You look like Gumby.

223
00:36:57,305 --> 00:36:59,640
You're gonna fit right in.

224
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,818
For your information, Captain,
I shot one of your Russians.

225
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:08,273
Unfortunately, he's not dead.
He's in intensive care.

226
00:37:08,346 --> 00:37:10,802
When he comes to,
maybe you should talk to him.

227
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,533
How long before this happens?

228
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:15,735
Is this 60 Minutes?
Do I look like a doctor?

229
00:37:16,763 --> 00:37:18,618
Other things first.

230
00:37:20,508 --> 00:37:21,914
Hey, Gumby?

231
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:25,042
Where do you think you're going?

232
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:28,345
Lighten up. I got it.
Thanks.

233
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,609
- What are you doing out of bed?
- He thinks he's gonna find Viktor.

234
00:37:31,676 --> 00:37:34,459
- That's cute. Keep an eye on him.
- Why me?

235
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:36,945
Because I said so.
He's a material witness.

236
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,409
Maybe Donnelly can figure out
what to do.

237
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:42,649
- How come I get all the shit jobs?
- Because it fits you.

238
00:37:42,717 --> 00:37:46,100
- You come with me?
- You heard. I just got my orders.

239
00:37:46,174 --> 00:37:49,403
- Take me to the same hotel?
- Do I look like a cab?

240
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,225
Yes.

241
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:56,854
I just took him back
to the hotel.

242
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:59,130
He went in,
came out ten minutes later.

243
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:01,916
I didn't know what to do,
so I brought him here.

244
00:38:01,982 --> 00:38:03,389
Okay. Good.

245
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:08,509
About your involvement in this,
you know standard procedure.

246
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:12,917
If you're a witness to a murder, you
can't be active in the investigation.

247
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,228
Okay, I know.

248
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:18,044
I'm not taking you off the case.

249
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:20,478
You and Gallagher were friends.

250
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:22,845
I'll fit you in somehow.

251
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,301
Send in Danko.

252
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:35,065
The two Russian suits
that showed up at the hospital.

253
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:37,111
They want Danko in a big way.

254
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,934
So I told them we'd put him
on a plane soon.

255
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,208
Please be seated, Captain.

256
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,289
You've met Lieutenant Stobbs?

257
00:38:47,362 --> 00:38:49,816
Stobbs is the point man
in this investigation.

258
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:53,468
We met. I'd like to run
this by you, Captain.

259
00:38:56,673 --> 00:39:00,088
"Viktor Rosta. Full name,
Viktor Sedgavich Rostavili.

260
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:03,959
"Born September 4, 1944.
Georgia, Russia.

261
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:07,647
"His father had the distinction
of being hanged by the U.S.S.R....

262
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:09,950
"for the crime of Brigandage."

263
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:11,512
Brigandage?

264
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:15,612
Burning villages, raping women.

265
00:39:16,803 --> 00:39:18,908
That goes on in Russia?

266
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:21,085
In past, during war.

267
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:22,585
Not now.

268
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,212
According to you.
According to this...

269
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:28,000
Viktor spent three years
in the army and six...

270
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:30,620
on a forced labor camp
for drug offenses.

271
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:32,699
"Is currently wanted
in the U.S.S.R.....

272
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:35,806
"for murder, kidnapping, rape...

273
00:39:35,877 --> 00:39:38,626
"extortion,
currency speculation...

274
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:40,929
"and drug dealing."

275
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:43,452
Where did you get this information?

276
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:47,551
Your boys in Washington have decided
to be cooperative since Viktor split.

277
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:49,923
In fact, they got
a whole new attitude.

278
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:52,290
I hear they're sending
over some caviar.

279
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:57,700
Why didn't you tell us
this before?

280
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:59,653
I had no authorization.

281
00:39:59,718 --> 00:40:01,093
Bullshit!

282
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:05,220
My government does not like
to do laundry in public.

283
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:07,424
Anything else we should know?

284
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:11,328
I will not leave this country
without Viktor.

285
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,107
I need cooperation.

286
00:40:19,431 --> 00:40:21,341
You wanna stick around...

287
00:40:21,415 --> 00:40:24,414
and find Viktor, Captain,
that's fine by me.

288
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:29,156
One more thing.

289
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:31,711
I don't want the press
to get near you.

290
00:40:31,783 --> 00:40:34,533
And don't roll through town
like the Red Army!

291
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,927
Have you wigged out?

292
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:45,955
Danko is the perfect weapon;
a loose cannon.

293
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:48,872
If he helps us find Rosta,
great.

294
00:40:48,937 --> 00:40:52,418
If he screws up, breaks rules,
he's a Russian.

295
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:55,785
- But what about Ridzik?
- Ridzik is a good cop.

296
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:59,079
And a total expert at fucking up.

297
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:03,172
Departmentally speaking,
I got no downside here.

298
00:41:03,242 --> 00:41:05,577
I'm having them bring in
Gallagher's snitch...

299
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:09,025
the guy who helped us bust
the cleanheads.

300
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:14,533
He's a sleaze, but I think he can tell
us who's brokering the cleanhead's deal.

301
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:16,065
He visits Viktor in jail?

302
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,081
Only two folks had that honor:

303
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:21,220
A skirt named Cat Manzetti
and that Russian I shot.

304
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,390
The girl teaches dance
in Wicker Park for the city.

305
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,394
We're gonna try to catch up
with her later on tonight.

306
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:29,802
About this pile of shit pimp here.

307
00:41:29,868 --> 00:41:33,316
In this country, we try to protect
the rights of individuals.

308
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:37,448
It's called the Miranda Act, and it says
you can't even touch his ass.

309
00:41:37,516 --> 00:41:41,377
I do not want to touch his ass.
I want to make him talk.

310
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:44,491
I'm gonna handle this one.

311
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,606
Hey, Streak.

312
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,360
- You can't hold me here, Dickweed!
- Hostility.

313
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:58,731
You got nothing on me.
This is bullshit!

314
00:41:58,797 --> 00:42:00,870
- Easy.
- Where is Viktor?

315
00:42:00,942 --> 00:42:03,179
What the fuck are you doing?

316
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:06,726
I don't know who he thinks he is.
I'll have both your badges!

317
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:09,733
Easy, Streak.
Just sit down, relax.

318
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:12,741
I wanna ask you a couple of questions
about the cleanheads.

319
00:42:12,815 --> 00:42:15,433
Fair price for services rendered?

320
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:18,219
Capitalism works, right, Streak?

321
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:22,443
Cleanheads got a monster deal going
down. I told Gallagher. End of story.

322
00:42:22,511 --> 00:42:24,235
He lies.

323
00:42:24,303 --> 00:42:27,085
In this country, he has
that God-given right.

324
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:33,327
Do I smell heroin?

325
00:42:33,391 --> 00:42:35,365
- What's this?
- Come on, man!

326
00:42:35,439 --> 00:42:38,342
-You bring this into the police station?
-You planted that.

327
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:40,783
That's disrespectful.
This is distribution weight.

328
00:42:40,848 --> 00:42:41,994
Fuckin' cop setup!

329
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:44,137
You're fired.

330
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:46,510
Cleanheads' deal:
who, when and where?

331
00:42:46,576 --> 00:42:49,129
The lawyer I got makes ACLU
look like Nazis.

332
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:52,462
He lives for cop misconduct.
Probably sue you for free.

333
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:55,082
And I ain't tellin' you shit!

334
00:42:57,649 --> 00:42:59,591
Jesus! Oh, shit!

335
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:02,730
Abdul Elijah runs the deal
from Joliet.

336
00:43:02,801 --> 00:43:05,584
Shit's comin' in a couple of days.
I don't know where.

337
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,585
I swear on my balls!
I don't know!

338
00:43:13,713 --> 00:43:15,917
Soviet method is more economical.

339
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,586
I'm so glad I took the time
to explain an individual's rights.

340
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:29,418
Sorry about that hand.
You gotta watch these doorjambs.

341
00:43:29,491 --> 00:43:31,345
They're dangerous.

342
00:43:33,075 --> 00:43:36,938
Breaking his goddamn fingers in front
of me. You can't pull a stunt like that.

343
00:43:37,012 --> 00:43:39,379
- You ignored me.
- Miranda?

344
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:42,226
In your country, it's okay
to lie, put drug in pocket?

345
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:44,911
No, not really.

346
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:49,039
Maybe I was a little out of line.
I was just trying to get him to talk.

347
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:53,168
- I wasn't gonna prosecute the guy.
- We both go too far.

348
00:43:53,237 --> 00:43:57,492
Shit! All I know is Gallagher's dead,
your Russian's on the loose somewhere...

349
00:43:57,557 --> 00:44:00,208
and I gotta chauffeur you around
all goddamn day.

350
00:44:00,277 --> 00:44:02,612
It really sucks.

351
00:44:02,677 --> 00:44:04,816
Who is Abdul Elijah?

352
00:44:04,886 --> 00:44:08,715
He's got one of the biggest
criminal organizations going now.

353
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:10,993
- Where can we find him?
- In jail.

354
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:13,069
Miranda Law is there?

355
00:44:13,142 --> 00:44:15,859
Yes. Miranda is there.

356
00:44:15,926 --> 00:44:19,342
Even scumbags have rights
in this country. I told you.

357
00:44:19,415 --> 00:44:23,790
In Soviet Union, only after two days
can scumbag talk to lawyer.

358
00:44:23,863 --> 00:44:25,652
You're shitting me!

359
00:44:25,718 --> 00:44:27,693
I am not shitting on you.

360
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:30,069
We go to see Abdul? Yes?

361
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:33,998
Sure. Whatever you say, Gumby.
I'm your escort.

362
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,454
That suit's not gonna explode
or anything?

363
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,854
- I think you're safe.
- Just checking.

364
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:44,368
Once I lock one of these fuckers up,
the gangs take over.

365
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,921
The Aryan brotherhood,
the cleanheads, the Muslims.

366
00:44:47,993 --> 00:44:52,597
Since most convicts are repeaters,
gang leaders got connections to outside.

367
00:44:52,664 --> 00:44:54,552
They're in operation.

368
00:45:02,298 --> 00:45:03,988
Cleanheads' playground.

369
00:45:04,057 --> 00:45:07,319
- From now on, you're on your own.
- Thanks.

370
00:45:09,177 --> 00:45:11,447
There he is. Abdul Elijah...

371
00:45:11,514 --> 00:45:13,369
sitting on his throne
with his cronies.

372
00:45:13,434 --> 00:45:15,572
He makes them shave their heads
to prove obedience.

373
00:45:15,641 --> 00:45:19,057
I guess the rules are different
for the bosses.

374
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,780
Kind of like your government, lvan?

375
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,258
Come here, you.

376
00:45:23,322 --> 00:45:25,744
I wanna talk to you.

377
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:30,096
This Captain Danko. He's come from
Russia to speak to your scoutmaster.

378
00:45:30,171 --> 00:45:32,113
That's nice, but who
the fuck are you?

379
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:36,149
These men have no respect
of our authority as police officers.

380
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,300
No shit.

381
00:45:37,372 --> 00:45:40,754
Revolutionary political leaders,
like myself...

382
00:45:40,828 --> 00:45:42,966
are incarcerated to keep us quiet.

383
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:45,556
What is your political crime?

384
00:45:45,628 --> 00:45:47,351
I robbed a bank.

385
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,796
Now, let's get to it, Mr. Moscow.
What is it you want?

386
00:45:51,868 --> 00:45:54,007
I have Viktor's key.

387
00:45:54,077 --> 00:45:56,498
If that's true, then you also
have Viktor's money...

388
00:45:56,572 --> 00:46:00,631
and all you need is half a hundred
dollar bill and you and me do business.

389
00:46:00,701 --> 00:46:03,189
I give you key,
you give me Viktor.

390
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:05,723
That is unethical.

391
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:09,916
You keep cocaine.

392
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:16,472
Bad. You're trying to make me
compromise my principles.

393
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:18,963
We are not like American police.

394
00:46:19,038 --> 00:46:23,381
You ship drugs to my country,
and one morning you will wake up...

395
00:46:23,453 --> 00:46:27,251
and find your testicles floating
in jars of water next to your bed.

396
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,710
I'm a holy man.
I got no need for testicles.

397
00:46:31,743 --> 00:46:34,231
Then I settle for your eyes.

398
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:38,198
You can't threaten me,
white boy.

399
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:45,241
You want to know what my crime is?
My crime was being born.

400
00:46:45,312 --> 00:46:49,470
I'm 38 years old and I've been
locked up 26 of those.

401
00:46:49,537 --> 00:46:51,838
I educated myself in here.

402
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:56,857
I've come to understand this country
was built on exploiting the black man.

403
00:46:56,928 --> 00:47:00,278
Of course, I don't hear anything
about brothers in your country.

404
00:47:00,353 --> 00:47:03,070
But your country exploits
its own people just the same.

405
00:47:03,137 --> 00:47:06,912
So I guess that makes me
the only Marxist around here...

406
00:47:06,977 --> 00:47:08,701
right, comrade?

407
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,585
You see, this ain't
just no drug deal.

408
00:47:11,651 --> 00:47:14,017
This is politics, baby.
This is economics.

409
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,089
This is spiritual.

410
00:47:16,162 --> 00:47:18,463
I plan to sell drugs...

411
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:21,050
to every white man
in the world...

412
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:23,834
and his sister.

413
00:47:26,947 --> 00:47:28,638
I still want Rosta.

414
00:47:28,707 --> 00:47:32,090
- Yeah, real bad. I can tell.
- Where can I find him?

415
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:34,880
I tell you what I am gonna do,
Captain.

416
00:47:36,963 --> 00:47:41,121
I am gonna put you two white boys
together, see if you can't work it out.

417
00:47:41,188 --> 00:47:42,682
I need Viktor.

418
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:44,610
He needs that key.

419
00:47:45,732 --> 00:47:47,193
And you...

420
00:47:48,644 --> 00:47:51,939
you're just another motherfucker
we gonna have to deal with.

421
00:47:54,693 --> 00:47:56,319
Be cool.

422
00:48:07,942 --> 00:48:10,560
Okay, so tell me.
How did it go?

423
00:48:10,629 --> 00:48:12,800
- Fine.
- Fine?

424
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:14,462
You wanna cut the shit?

425
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:18,243
You were talking to that jazzbo so long,
I thought about having my head shaved.

426
00:48:19,558 --> 00:48:21,414
It could be a good idea.

427
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:25,414
- What's that?
- My watch.

428
00:48:25,478 --> 00:48:29,089
- It's on Moscow time.
- Time to pick up Pokey?

429
00:48:29,158 --> 00:48:31,166
- Time to feed parakeet.
- What's that?

430
00:48:31,238 --> 00:48:33,442
Russian for jerking off?

431
00:48:35,943 --> 00:48:38,757
- I guess not.
- What's wrong with parakeet?

432
00:48:38,822 --> 00:48:41,376
Nothing. I didn't say anything
was wrong with parakeet.

433
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:43,749
My kid sister used to have one.

434
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:46,402
You want a parakeet, it's okay
with me. I don't give a shit.

435
00:48:46,472 --> 00:48:48,326
You think that parakeet is feminine?

436
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:52,069
Did I say that?
I didn't say that, did l?

437
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,689
What do I know?
I guess it's okay.

438
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,029
- Christ, it's fine.
- Thank you.

439
00:48:57,097 --> 00:48:58,558
You're welcome.

440
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:01,151
Slow and fast.

441
00:49:01,225 --> 00:49:04,542
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, hips.

442
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:08,289
Easy.

443
00:49:12,106 --> 00:49:13,961
One, two, smooth.

444
00:49:27,819 --> 00:49:31,114
Mind showing me l.D.?
I like to know who I'm talking to.

445
00:49:31,179 --> 00:49:33,731
Ridzik, Arthur.
Detective Sergeant.

446
00:49:33,802 --> 00:49:35,657
This is Captain Danko.
He's from Moscow.

447
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,057
You went to see Rosta in jail.

448
00:49:38,123 --> 00:49:39,717
- What did you talk about?
- The weather...

449
00:49:39,788 --> 00:49:42,090
taxes, inflation.

450
00:49:42,156 --> 00:49:45,189
Did you meet him hanging around
the hotel bar, lobby?

451
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,885
Fuck you.

452
00:49:46,955 --> 00:49:49,257
No. I have a headache
and good taste.

453
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:51,396
I don't have to listen.

454
00:49:53,516 --> 00:49:57,292
It's very important.
Many people could be hurt.

455
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,241
Shit.

456
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:04,258
It's really no big deal.

457
00:50:04,332 --> 00:50:08,010
He told me to go to The Garvin, get
his old room, where exactly to look.

458
00:50:08,077 --> 00:50:11,373
It was just a passport and this
hundred-dollar bill torn in half.

459
00:50:11,438 --> 00:50:14,820
I gave it to a friend of Viktor's.
I don't even know his name.

460
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:17,828
Cut the shit!
Just tell me where he's at.

461
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:18,796
I don't know.

462
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:19,975
- You got a phone number?
- I lost it.

463
00:50:20,046 --> 00:50:24,007
- Look, this Viktor's a very bad guy.
- Really?

464
00:50:24,078 --> 00:50:27,045
- A cop died because of him.
- I don't know.

465
00:50:27,117 --> 00:50:31,341
You know anything about 11th and State?
I'll take you and book you for murder.

466
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:34,702
- Trying to scare me?
- Wondering why you're helping Viktor.

467
00:50:34,767 --> 00:50:36,622
He's my husband.

468
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:43,880
I'm gonna bust that bitch so hard
she bounces.

469
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:48,109
Wait. We can use her
to find Viktor.

470
00:50:50,193 --> 00:50:53,674
You got all the ideas.
Maybe I'll go home and whack off.

471
00:50:53,745 --> 00:50:56,078
Watch Crime Stories.

472
00:50:57,232 --> 00:51:01,575
Viktor uses fake name,
marries American to get visa to U.S.

473
00:51:01,648 --> 00:51:05,195
Right. Why do I get the feeling
you're taking it so personal?

474
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:08,112
I shot his brother
six months ago in Moscow.

475
00:51:08,177 --> 00:51:09,966
- Shot him dead?
- Yes.

476
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:12,554
- Way to go.
- Thank you.

477
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,017
Why don't we stake it out?
You go to the car.

478
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:31,345
I'll get something to eat. I'll get you
something healthy from all food groups:

479
00:51:31,411 --> 00:51:33,746
hamburger, french fries,
coffee, donuts.

480
00:51:33,811 --> 00:51:35,817
- Wait.
- You don't like onions?

481
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,672
- Give me key to car.
- It's unlocked.

482
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:40,332
In case she leave.

483
00:51:40,403 --> 00:51:43,884
No, you can't drive that car.
What if you crash?

484
00:51:43,956 --> 00:51:46,509
That means I gotta fill out reports
until I retire.

485
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:48,784
Key.

486
00:51:52,372 --> 00:51:55,372
All right. But honk
if you see something.

487
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:26,577
Hey, asshole.
You can't park here.

488
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:29,167
This is my parking place.
I live right up there.

489
00:52:29,238 --> 00:52:31,758
So move or give me 50 bucks.

490
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:35,179
- I do not understand.
- Let me make it simple, moron.

491
00:52:35,254 --> 00:52:38,866
You move your ass or gimme 50
or I take my bat...

492
00:52:38,935 --> 00:52:40,757
and mutilate your car.

493
00:52:40,823 --> 00:52:43,823
- Do you know Miranda?
- Never heard of the bitch.
