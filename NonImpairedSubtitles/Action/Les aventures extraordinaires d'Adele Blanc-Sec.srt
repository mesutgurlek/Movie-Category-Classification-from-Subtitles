       Whew! Well, Naomi,
          here we are.

00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,236
        My favorite view

00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,171
          You were right, Elena.

5
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,073
                 It was
                 worth the hike,

6
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,474
                   even if there
                   was no path.

7
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,243
        Well, there used
           to be one.

8
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:47,813
       But I haven't been
      up here in 41 years.

9
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,515
                Oh, right.

10
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,850
                 You were stuck
                 in that amulet.

11
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,920
Yes. That's kind of why
I wanted to come up here.

12
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,222
There's something
I need to show you.

13
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,034
         What is that?

14
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,837
This wand belonged
to Shuriki,

15
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,272
the sorceress
who invaded Avalor.

16
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:16,375
             The one who put you
             in that amulet?

17
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,110
            Sort of.

18
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:19,945
      It's time I told you
       the whole story--

19
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,448
     how I lost everything
     and everyone I loved,

20
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,850
       and how I finally
    found my way back home.

21
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:28,720
The truth is, I would
still be trapped in
that amulet today

22
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,256
if it wasn't for
a brave young princess

00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,761
That was weird.

29
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,463
It was like
I just had a dream,

30
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,298
but I was
wide awake.

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,300
        It's called daydreaming.
        I do it all the time.

                to find out

38
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:34,586
        where Daddy is taking us
        for our summer trip.

39
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,421
              Come along, Sofia.

40
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,090
   Yeah, we better get home.

41
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,492
      And I better get to
      the secret library.

KING ROLAND: The kids will
be here any minute, Miranda.

where we're taking them.

44

           What about Corinthia?

45
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,135
I was hoping to go someplace
we haven't been before.

46
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,371
The kingdom could use
a new trading partner.

47
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,439
          We're home!

48
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,542
         So, where are
        we going, Daddy?

49
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,777
       We're still trying
   to figure that out, Amber.

   Like the Amulet of Avalor?

53
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,267
          Exactly like
     the Amulet of Avalor.

      Don't be so alarmed.

56
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:01,673
   I know I am not the first
 talking book you've seen here.

57
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,942
       Usually, they just
       tell the stories.

58
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,577
     They don't talk to me.

59
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,947
    Well, this book was made
     by a powerful wizard.

60
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:09,915
              Who?

         Me. Alacazar.

  The royal wizard of Avalor.

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,587
Well, I was
a royal wizard,

64
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,457
       before I turned myself
       into a talking book.

65
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,625
      Why did you do that?

66
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,927
             It is a long story,

67
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,929
              which I am
              about to tell you,

                   so get comfy.

    Across the great ocean,

71
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,538
    in the enchanted kingdom
           of Avalor,

72
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,943
        there once lived
 a young princess named Elena.

73
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,647
     <i> On her 15th birthday,</i>
    <i> her mother, Queen Lucia,</i>

74
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,449
   <i> gave her a magical amulet,</i>

75

     <i> the Amulet of Avalor,</i>
       <i> a family heirloom,</i>

76
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,822
        <i> passed down from</i>
   <i> generation to generation,</i>

77
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,824
           <i> that would</i>
     <i> protect her from harm.</i>

78
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,662
      <i> But one fateful day,</i>
         <i> Queen Shuriki,</i>

79
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:59,064
     <i> an evil, power-hungry</i>
           <i> sorceress</i>

80
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,733
   <i> from the northern islands,</i>
        <i> invaded Avalor.</i>

81
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,636
          <i> She attacked</i>
      <i> the king and queen,</i>

82
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,571
      <i> then set her sights</i>
        <i> upon the palace.</i>

83
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:10,976
  <i> Princess Elena bravely chose</i>
  <i> to face Shuriki on her own,</i>

84
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,178
              so that her family
              would be spared.

85
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,914
       I saw this before
        in my daydream.

86
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,183
            That was Elena's way
            of calling you here,

87
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,752
             so I could tell you
             the whole story.

88
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,689
       <i> Now, when Shuriki</i>
   <i> tried to strike her down,</i>

89
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:28,160
     <i> the amulet saved Elena</i>
   <i> by pulling her inside it.</i>

90
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,166
  And that is how the princess
  wound up inside your amulet.

91
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,502
       There's a princess
       inside my amulet?

92
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,604
            And she's been there
            for 41 years.

93
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,541
          But this is
    the most important part.

94
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,711
    Shuriki thought she had
      gotten rid of Elena,

95
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,612
       but she was wrong.

96
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,782
     <i> I soon discovered that</i>
    <i> the only way to get her</i>

97

98
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,986
          <i> was to find</i>
       <i> a special princess</i>

99
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,389
    <i> who could set her free.</i>

100
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,324
      <i> I searched the globe</i>
           <i> for years</i>

101
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,560
      <i> until I grew too old</i>
          <i> to continue,</i>

102
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,729
       <i> and used the last</i>

103
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,865
      <i> to transform myself</i>
        <i> into this book,</i>

104
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,402
   so that someday, her story
   could have a happy ending.

105
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:13,171
          And at last,
         it seems Elena

106
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,641
   finally found the princess
  we have been searching for.

107
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,478
             She chose me?

108
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,879
You catch on quickly.

109
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,647
I like that.

110
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,050
  Now, in order to find Elena,

111
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,219
       you must travel to
       my home in Avalor,

112
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,987
     and summon my chanul.

113
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,689
        Wait. I have to do what?

114
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,592
    Go to my home in Avalor
     and summon my chanul.

115
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,861
        But be careful,
       for Queen Shuriki

116
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,863
      still rules Avalor,

117
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,599
       and is as powerful
       and evil as ever.

118
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,601
    So you probably want to
      keep your distance.

119
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,840
I can see
you are unsure.

120
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:52,677
Listen, Elena tested
many princesses before you.

121
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,780
She granted them
powers and curses,

122
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:58,617
          but you are
    the only one she chose,

123
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,952
        and she has been
   preparing you for this day

124
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,555
        since you first
       put on the amulet.

125
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,857
       So you can do this
       if you choose to.

126
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,860
          Her story is in
          your hands now, Sofia.

127
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,797
        It is up to you
          how it ends.

128
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,816
       I don't care where
    the dart landed, James.

129
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,084
        We are not going
       to the North Pole.

130
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,220
          I know where
         we should go.

131
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,289
    We should go to Avalor.

132
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,891
           - What?
           - Avalor?

133
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,827

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,194
         ( bell rings )

175
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,401
          We're here!

176
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,169
                 Amber, wake up.

177
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,271
                What's going on?
                Where are we?

178
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,907
        We're in Avalor.

179
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,610
          Ease the mainsail!

180
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,413
( sailors continue chattering )

181
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,850
                  Attention!

182
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,327
    Quite a sight,
    is it not?

183
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,996
     The kingdom of Avalor.

184
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,999
 SOFIA: How am I going to find
        Alacazar's house

185
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,769
       in that huge city?

186
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,103
           ROLAND: Good morning,
           Admiral Vazquez.

187
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,838
         Your Majesty.

188
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,841
     Have you sent word of
 our arrival to Queen Shuriki?

189
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,277
       - We sent a launch
       an hour ago.
       - Excellent.

190
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,979
    Why did you do that?

191
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,947
     It's the royal custom
     to greet the king or queen

192
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,050
           when visiting
           a new kingdom, Sofia.

193
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,518
We have to meet her?

194
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,353
    Yes. Isn't it exciting?

195
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,139
                  Queen Shuriki!

196
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,975
Oh! Don't sneak up
on me like that, Esteban.

197
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,311
       Can't you see I'm
    putting on my best face

198
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,547
       for our visitors?

199
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,216
          Oh, should I come back
          when you are finished?

200
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,585
    I am finished.

201
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,354
           Of course you are,
           my queen. My mistake.

202
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,958
       It is time to greet
       King Roland of Enchancia.

203
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,363
      Everything must look
  its absolute best, Armando.

204
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,998
Yes, Your Grace.

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,701
 I have spent years making this
    the cleanest, quietest,

206
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:19,070
      most orderly kingdom
         in the world.

207
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,005
    Nothing is out of place,

208
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,273
         everyone does
       what they're told,

209
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,409
         no unruliness.

210
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:31,116
  No irritating jingle-jangle
       of bells or music.

211
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,251
  Just simple peace and quiet.

212
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,919
        No one will make
      a peep, Your Grace.

213
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,056
       Except the cheers
   of my subjects, of course.

214
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,359
    And the cheering crowds
  will be cheering this time,

215
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,695
       correct, Esteban?

216
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:48,566
    We sent the royal guards
 ahead to offer encouragement.

217
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,034
            Perfect.

218
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,906
          ( cheering )

219
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,975
         Hello. Hello.

220
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,581
        This is quite a welcome.

221
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,416
                 I'll say.

222
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,752
              Hello. Hello!

223
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,454
           They really like me.

224
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:17,162
       Oh, they like her
           even more.

225
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,063
           I'd keep my distance,
           Amber.

226
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,233
    Yes, your beloved queen
          has arrived.

227
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,235
    Cheer like you mean it.

228
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,638
       Welcome to Avalor.

229
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,174
      I am Queen Shuriki.

230
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,010
            And I am
      Chancellor Esteban.

231
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,179
       Oh, it is an honor
 that you have chosen to visit

232
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,347
      our humble kingdom.

233
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,818
 You honor us with such a warm
   reception, Queen Shuriki.

234
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,452
       That is the Avaloran way,
       King Roland.

235
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,188
     ( flute music plays )

236
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,390
     Oh, what pretty music.

237
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,597
       Now let us adjourn
         to the palace.

238
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,232
             Esteban, the flute.

239
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,174
              Hey!

240
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,178
  ( boy crying )

241
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,347
      After you, princess.

242
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,509
      The palace was built
         centuries ago.

243
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,012
      It's a little busy,
         if you ask me.

244
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,915
          And this is
        my throne room.

245
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,250
        I spend most of
         my time here.

246
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,252
           So what do you think?

247
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,121
     That's quite a throne.

248
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,123
               Thank you.

249
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,692
    Took them over a decade
  to dig up all the diamonds.

250
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,395
   But it was worth the wait.

251
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,096
           ( gasps )
       Don't touch that!

252
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,198
        James, where are
         your manners?

253
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,101
  It's a very delicate fabric.

254
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,103
Come along, my boy.

255
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,240
    You must all be famished
   after such a long journey,

256
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:45,376
   so I... I mean, the queen,
     had the chefs prepare

257
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,979
         a small taste
     of the local cuisine.

258
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,549
     MIRANDA: Oh, it's such
         a lovely view

259
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,284
         from up here,
         Queen Shuriki.

260
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,887
       I can't wait to go
     back down to the city

261
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,755
          and look at
 all the beautiful old houses.

262
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,123
          Old houses?

263
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,093
     That's the last thing
you should be looking at, dear.

264
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,262
        Our marketplace
         and park lands

265
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,230
      are second to none.

266
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,632
  Esteban, clear my schedule.

267
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,434
       I shall personally
        give our guests

268
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,336
       a tour of the city
        this afternoon.

269
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,339
           Hey, hey,
   what's for lunch, Shuriki?

270
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,440
What are those?

271
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,275
     Oh, those are jaquins.

272
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,177
       Magical creatures
           of legend.

273
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,979
        Majestic symbols
           of Avalor.

274
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,181
        They used to be
    symbols of our kingdom.

275
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,350
          Now they are
        just a nuisance.

276
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,751
                    Why is that?

277
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,787
        Because we sing.
             Ha ha!

278
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,423
        ♪ From the misty

282
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,265
            They're singing!

283
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,101
Can you believe
that, Sofia?

284
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,335
Talking animals!

285
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,837
       Who ever heard of
         such a thing?

286
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,973
     Let's dig in,<i> amigos!</i>

287
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,776
          Oh, ho, ho,
       that looks tasty.

288
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,178
    LUNA: Hey, save room for
        dessert, Skylar.

289
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,180
   My compliments to the chef

290
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,216
        and whoever said
    you should eat outside,

291
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,817
         'cause that is
         a great idea!

292
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,352
           Brilliant.

293
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,022
           Oh, shoo.
  Get out of here, you pests.

294
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,057
                 Aw, but we just
                 got here.

295
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,292
         You can tell the people
         what to do,

296
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,527
                 but you can't
                 boss us around.

297
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,195
             Mess with a jaquin,
             you get the claws.

298
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,731
           That's it.
       Enough is enough.

299
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,734
Let's finish our meal
inside, shall we?

300
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,670
           Yes, yes.

301
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,572
            Let's all go inside.

302
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,482
      ( jaquins laughing )

303
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,921
    Mmm. Food tastes better
 when we take it from Shuriki.

304
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,223
        It's paw-licking good.

305
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,225
        LUNA: This mango
          is sublime.

306
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,361
         Um, excuse me.

307
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,930
       Hey, what are you
     still doing out here?

308
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,866
     I'm not exactly sure,
   but maybe you can help me.

309
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,269
         We do not help
      friends of Shuriki.

310
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,104
      I'm not her friend.

311
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,672
           My family
    had to visit the palace.

312
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,908
       I really came here
   to find Alacazar's house.

313
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,543
                 Who's Alacazar?

314
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,412
  He was the old royal wizard.
           Remember?

315
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,848
           Oh, yeah.

316
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,516
           Didn't he split after
           Shuriki took over?

317
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,251
       Who can blame him?

318
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,886
     She probably would've
           zapped him

319
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,456
    like the king and queen,
      and Princess Elena.

320
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,559
         - So young.
         - So brave.
         - Poor Elena.

321
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,095
    Well, what if I told you
          I know a way

322
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,030
 to bring Princess Elena back?

323
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,132
       You better not be
  toying with me, little girl,

324
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,268
 because I am highly emotional
    and extremely gullible.

325
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,204
I'm telling the truth.

326
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,939
So if one of you knows
where Alacazar's house is,

327
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,707
maybe you could
take me there.

328
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:33,778
           Whoa ho now,
           what do we look like,
           flying horses?

329
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,613
      Do you see a saddle
         on this back?

330
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,281
Relax, you two.

331
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,450
      - What's your name?
            - Sofia.

332
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,320
    Well, Sofia, if you can
       bring back Elena,

333
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,722
         I'll take you
      to Alacazar's house,

334
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,457
       as soon as someone
     tells me where it is.

335
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,493
                It's right below
                the moon cliff.

336
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,094
           One of the old timers
           showed me once.

337
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,729
            Hop on,
         Your Highness.

338
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,503
            Thanks.

339
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,506
           This is gonna take
           some getting used to.

340
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,341
               Hold on!

341
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,754
   Your kingdom is beautiful.

342
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,423
It looked even better
before Shuriki took over.

343
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,525
           Sure did.

344
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,426
    And sounded better, too.

345
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,761
   What do you mean?

346
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,797
     - She outlawed music.
             - Why?

347
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,367
Because she wanted
everyone to forget
the old Avalor.

348
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,003
     That's why we jaquins
          still sing.

349
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:36,974
  To remind everyone that
  the spirit of Avalor lives on.

350
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,043
            And 'cause it really
            bugs Shuriki.

               Whew!

400
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,586
          That was a workout.

401
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,332
     Hello. Can I help you?

402
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,702
        Hi. Uh, was this
       Alacazar's house?

403
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,438
      Alacazar? I'm sorry,

404
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,541
   but he has not lived here
        for many years.

405
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,177
       I know, but maybe
        you can help me.

406
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,145
  I need to summon his chanul.

407
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:30,214
          I don't know
         what that is,

408
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,949
         but I'm afraid
    you won't find it here.

409
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,185
         Good day now.

410
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,953
Well, that could've
gone better.

411
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,655
How do you know
what a chanul is?

412
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,190
              Oh, well...

413
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,058
That was my mom
you were just talking to.

414
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,326
I'm Mateo.

415
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,562
    Wait. You're Alacazar's
           grandson?

416
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:45,996
    You know my grandfather?

417
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,798
          Uh, sort of.

418
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,533
       My name is Sofia.

419
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,302
       I know this might
         sound strange,

420
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,571
      but your grandfather
          sent me here

421
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:55,005
    to free Princess Elena.

422
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,574
        Princess Elena?!

423
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,342
      Wait. That means...

424
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,978
that's the Amulet
of Avalor.

425
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,646
          Yes. How did you know?

426
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,415
My mother told me
the story so many times,

427
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,883
        I memorized it.
           Follow me.

428
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,252
     - Where are we going?
       - To my workshop.

429
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,492
         Wish me luck.

430
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,198
           It's a long way down.

431
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,434
                I know, but it's
                the only way

432
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,769
              to keep
              everything secret.

433
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,837
       When Queen Shuriki
           took over,

434
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,673
she banned all magic
except her own.

435
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,709
         So there are no wizards
         in Avalor?

436
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,411
     Not anymore.

437
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,679
My grandma hid
all my grandpa's
things down here,

438
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,215
      but my mother never wanted
      anything to do with it.

439
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,084
                  So it sat here
                  all locked up

440
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,619
               until I found it.

441
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:44,221
   I've been trying to teach
    myself magic ever since.

442
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,257
         Okay, now let me think.

443
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,858
       I just need a few things.

444
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,463
          Okay, sit here, Sofia.

445
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:54,365
              Why?

446
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:56,700
           We're going to summon
           my grandpa's chanul.

447
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,771
What is a chanul exactly?

448
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,740
                A spirit animal.

449
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,242
           It's like a guide to
           all the magical stuff
           in the world

450
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,278
            that we can't see,
            like Princess Elena.

451
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,113
   It was my grandpa's chanul
        who figured out

452
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,882
           she was in the amulet
           and told him how
           to get her out.

453
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,717
                 Here we go.

454
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,788
       Now where's my tamborita?

455
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,264
  Okay, this is the first time
  I've tried this incantation,

456
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,668
so it may not work for the first
      eight or nine times.

457
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,803
            Maybe ten. Ahem.

458
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,240
         Appear to us,
   animal spirit of Alacazar.

459
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,810
  <i> Illuminara Alacazar wayohel!</i>

460
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,248
                      It's okay.

461
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,650
         I have another
           drumstick.

462
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,519
           Let's try that again.

463
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:52,356
  <i> Illuminara Alacazar wayohel!</i>

464
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,829
           ( gasps )
              Huh?

465
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,865
       What's happening?

466
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,933
             I am.

467
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,869
         Greetings from
       the spirit world!

468
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,337
 How ya doin' today?

469
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,439
                O mighty chanul,

470
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:10,774
          you honor us
      with your presence.

471
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,309
  Hey, I know you're excited.

472
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,111
           I get it.

473
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,780
       It's not every day
you meet a spirit animal, right?

474
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,116
       But you called me,
           I'm here,

475
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,885
         so we can skip
        all the fanfare,

476
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,820
   and get on with it, okay?

477
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,889
       Of course, mighty chanul.

478
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,525
          Oh, you can
         call me Zuzo.

479
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,394
                 Yes, of course,
                 mighty Zuzo.

480
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,196
       You don't have to
       call me anything.

481
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:36,567
    So, you're the princess
    that's gonna free Elena.

482
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,736
I guess so.

483
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,371
All right then.

484
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,640
Now here's what
you gotta do.

485
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,708
          Wait. I thought I just
          had to summon you.

486
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,411
Uh-huh, so I can tell you
how to get her out.

487
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,713
That's what
spirit guides do.

488
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,549
        They guide you.

489
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,718
      First, you're gonna
         need the wand

490
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,753
    that put Elena in there.

491
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,755
     Queen Shuriki's wand?

492
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,723
        But she keeps it
         in her pocket.

493
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,158
         That's great.

494
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,993
      You'll know exactly
       where to find it.

495
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,195
 Now, once you've got the wand,

496
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,164
         you just wrap
      the amulet around it

497
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,199
         and put 'em on
     the crown of Aziluna.

498
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,735
      - The crown of who?
           - Aziluna.

499
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,605
He was a great healer who could
    undo any spell or curse.

500
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,740
  There's an ancient Maruvian
         statue of him

501
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,409
    way up in the mountains.

502
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:21,045
   It's kinda like a hospital
      for magical mishaps.

503
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,714
 But I don't know where it is,
      or how to get there,

504
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:26,383
   or how I'm going to steal
        Shuriki's wand.

505
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,752
Okay, let's all
take a big breath.

506
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:32,756
In. Out. Good.

507
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,859
       Now I've got some
 spirit animal wisdom for you.

508
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,028
                  Just because
                  you're the one

509
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,364
             doesn't mean you're
             the only one.

510
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:43,968
       That's not supposed to
       make any sense right now.
       You'll get it later.

511
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,638
      But first, you gotta
  go get that wand, princess.

512
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,641
All right, it's been a pleasure
 being your spirit guide today.

513
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,710
       Safe travels. Bye.

514
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,481
      How great was that?!

515
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,584
           I summoned
        my first chanul!

516
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:01,885
               Sorry. Whoa!

517
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:06,924
    Hey, nice move. I bet you're
    a good dancer, aren't you?

518
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,726
        That's how I'll
         get her wand.

519
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,628
      I'll dance with her.

520
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,062
                That won't work.

521
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,898
        Shuriki outlawed dancing
        when she banned music.

522
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,967
          My mom still taught me
          the sambarosa, though.

523
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,338
      - We have to go
      back to the palace.
      - We?

524
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,576
  ARMANDO: And when the farmer
 followed her into the jungle,

525
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:30,247
        she turned into
           a jaguar!

526
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,349
      But really, she was
         a wicked witch

527
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,917
       who had taken over
          the jungle.

528
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,020
                The farmer tried
                to escape...

529
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:39,456
Our kingdom has
a wide array of
enchanted agriculture,

530
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,859
and creatures,
not to mention

531
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:42,960
our flying horses.

532
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,862
Forget trading
with Enchancia.

533
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,530
We should invade it.

534
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,999
         Here you are,
           princess.

535
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,834
              You were out there
              a while, Sofia.

536
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,503
          The jaquins
        sang me a song.

537
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,839
Yes, they can't seem
to stop doing that.

538
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,442
            Well, Armando
            is putting on a show

539
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,944
   for the other little darlings
   if you want to join them.

540
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,946
     Actually, I was hoping
            to learn

541
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,182
      one of the Avaloran
dances I've heard so much about.

542
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,017
         The sambarosa.

543
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,487
         Oh, I'm afraid
    I don't know that dance.

544
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,790
      It's the most famous
        dance in Avalor.

545
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,793
          I can teach it to her.

546
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,861
    No, you won't, Armando.

547
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,797
           More tea, Your Grace?

548
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,801
  Why not? Is there some kind
    of law against dancing?

549
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:26,970
Sofia, no one would
pass a law against dancing.

550
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,073
That's like passing
a law against fun.

551
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,542
 Well, in Avalor, we--

552
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,744
              We only dance on
              special occasions,

553
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,813
              like royal visits.

554
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,915
         So we will be happy to
         show you the sambarosa.

555
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,316
              Right, Your Grace?

556
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,984
          If we must.

557
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,886
        Let me fetch the guitar.

558
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,588
                   Great.

559
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,027
     This is how you dance
         the sambarosa.

560
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:53,030
         You join hands
 and stomp your feet like this.

561
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,932
        Move back and forth,
        then twirl your partner.

562
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:57,101
             Whoo!

563
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,236
            Come on.
         Everyone try!

564
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,274
       ( both laughing )

565
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,912
          ( giggling )

566
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,581
          ( laughing )

567
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,686
         Queen Shuriki,
         will you dance with me?

568
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:17,755
Oh, how sweet of you
to offer,

569
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,758
but I'm having
too much fun watching you.

570
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,893
          But I'm sure you dance
          better than anyone.

571
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:23,961
            Please?

572
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:27,064
        How can I say no
     to such a dear child?

573
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,632
           ( gasps )

574
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,405
              Ow!

575
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:38,642
           So sorry, Your Grace.
           I'm so clumsy.

576
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:41,345
        Enough dancing!

577
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,582
          ( chuckles )

578
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:48,619
     I mean, so delightful.

579
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:51,755
         We really must
  get back to our discussions,

580
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:53,323
Your Majesties.

581
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,058
                  Can we play
                  hide-and-seek?

582
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,161
         Yes, yes, yes.
    Whatever you want, dear.

583
00:29:57,163 --> 00:30:00,864
We can dispose of that
now, Esteban.

584
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,836
   Sofia, I don't wanna play
         hide-and-seek.

585
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,437
It'll be fun, Amber.

586
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,607
Is it okay if we hide
and you seek, Mr. Armando?

587
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,910
                  Oh, of course.
                  That would be
                  delightful.

588
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:18,015
 Okay. One, two, three, four...

589
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:20,083
            Come on.

590
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:23,120
   Five, six, seven, eight...

591
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,988
          ( counting continues )

592
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,024
         What are you
         up to, Sofia?

593
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,525
      I'll explain later,

594
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,360
  but I need you both to hide
      as long as you can.

595
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,829
        It's important.

596
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,031
       - You got it, Sof.
    - Why won't you tell us?

597
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,733
It's for your own
good, trust me.

598
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,905
     Hmm.

599
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,050
           I got it!

600
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,618
        Right on, Sofia!

601
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,186
        I don't know how
      you pulled that off.

602
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,722
   Shuriki never lets anyone
       get close to her.

603
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,324
                    Look at her.

604
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:03,060
      Girl looks sweet as sugar,
      but she's got some skills.

605
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,195
  Okay, Mateo, show us the way
          to Aziluna.

606
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,464
      We've got a princess
            to free.

607
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,194
   SOFIA: What's that?

608
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:39,096
         An old Maruvian temple.

609
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,731
           The statue is inside.

610
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,238
     Whoa, man, they really
       let the place go.

611
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,707
          The Maruvians vanished
          centuries ago.

612
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,110
             No one knows what
             happened to them
             or where they went.

613
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:57,180
    All that's left of
    the ancient civilization
    of Maru are ruins like this.

614
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,261
             SOFIA:
      Where's the statue?

615
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,130
      Well, legend has it

616
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:14,965
    you need to swim across
      the enchanted waters

617
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,199
     for the magic to work.

618
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,103
You'll be fine, Sofia.
Good luck.

619
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,672
             Okay.

620
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,843
          ( grunting )

621
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,284
     Being a mermaid would
      really come in handy

622
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,186
        right about now.
           ( gasps )

623
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,490
         Whoa! Did you see that?

624
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,626
I wish I could
shape shift that easily.

625
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,144
                ( gasps )
                That must be it.

626
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,847
      Right. I have to put
      the amulet and wand

627
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:06,750
    on the crown of Aziluna.

628
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,360
             Whoa!

629
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,312
Whoa!

630
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,384
           My amulet.

631
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,585
       It changed color.

632
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,291
                 Princess Elena?

633
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,338
           ( laughs )

634
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
           I'm free!

635
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,943
       I'm finally free!
             Whoa!

636
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,847
        - Are you okay?
          - I'm good.

637
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,049
           I'm good.
  I guess that's what happens

638
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,919
    when you're stuck inside
    an amulet for 41 years.

639
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,253
    You forget how to walk.

640
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,788
    I knew you were the one!

641
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,057
           Thank you.

642
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,293
              You're... welcome.

643
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,629
                 Princess Elena!

644
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,431
Oh, jaquins.

645
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,599
        Princess Elena.

646
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,034
        Princess Elena!

647
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,168
       ( nervous giggle )

648
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,204
           I'm Mateo.

649
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:08,572
      Alacazar's grandson.

650
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:11,475
   Oh, you don't have to bow,
             Mateo.

651
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:14,044
And you can just
call me Elena.

652
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:15,745
                   Okay, Elena.

653
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,414
             I can't believe
             you're really back.

654
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,049
         Neither can I.

655
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:20,550
  I was in the amulet so long,

656
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,586
       I thought I might
         never get out.

657
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:23,753

              Okay, I'll see you
              back in the city.

693
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:53,903
      Where are you going?

694
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:56,806
        To give Shuriki
   a taste of her own magic.

695
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,442
       But Queen Shuriki
      is really powerful.

696
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,910
     Not without her wand.

697
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,646
   Wait. I'll come with you.

698
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,447
           - Me, too.
             - No.

699
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,150
       No. You've already
     risked so much for me.

700
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,985
       This is something
      I have to do alone.

701
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,654
           Let's go.

702
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,126
          We've got to help her.
          Let's go.

703
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:19,462
        Right. Go, Luna.
      Catch that princess.

704
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,964
       LUNA: Let's do it!

705
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,235
   Where are those children?

706
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,737
      Come out, come out,
       wherever you are.

707
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,639
          Any of you.

708
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,007
            Please.

709
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,685
          You want me
        to go with you?

710
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,586
   Thanks, but I've got this.

711
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,995
The trade agreement
is ready

712
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,763
for your signature,
Your Grace.

713
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,703
         Done. Now that
    that's taken care of...

714
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:01,137
        ELENA: Shuriki!

715
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,572
             - Huh?
             - Huh?

716
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,110
        Princess Elena!

717
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:09,679
       The time has come
    to pay for your crimes.

718
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,648
            Crimes?
          What crimes?

719
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,283
    Shuriki invaded Avalor,

720
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:15,385
         and overthrew
       the royal family.

721
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,453
           My family.

722
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:17,554
         Is this true?

723
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:19,956
           Oh, Elena.

724
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,858
          Some inherit
        their kingdoms.

725
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,395
      Others have to take
        theirs by force.

726
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:26,696
                  Hey!

727
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,798
         Then I'm here
       to take mine back.

728
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,569
      But Avalor has been
  so much better without you.

729
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,637
     Why ruin a good thing?

730
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,309
       Looking for this?

731
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:41,010
     How did you get that?

732
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,545
  It was that little princess.

733
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,880
          The one with
         the necklace.

734
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,316
         Wait. Sofia's
       involved in this?

735
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:49,486
       Yes. She freed me
        from her amulet,

736
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,588
  so that I could free Avalor
           from you.

737
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,256
        Oh, I don't know
          about that.

738
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:56,259
It takes more than
a wand to make you
a sorceress.

739
00:39:56,261 --> 00:40:00,063
Your spell has echoed in my mind
     for 40 years, Shuriki.

740
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,865
      I know it by heart.

741
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,733
           <i> Vadisima!</i>

742
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,935
         ( evil laugh )

743
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,205
       You'll have to do
       better than that.

744
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,774
           <i> Vadisima!</i>

745
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,680
                     ( gasps )

746
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,252
                   What is this?

747
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,788
        I've never seen
     this painting before.

748
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,791
       Oh, that's no
       ordinary painting, Elena.

749
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:31,428
       That's how Alacazar
       protected your little
       sister and grandparents--

750
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:36,199
    inside an enchanted painting
    even my magic cannot touch.

751
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:39,602
        <i> Abuelo. Abuela.</i>

752
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,371
            Isabel.

753
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:43,440
         And speaking of family,

754
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:47,043
       you haven't said hello to
       your cousin Esteban.

755
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,711
      ( nervous stammer )

756
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,280
              No.

757
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,215
         This cannot be Esteban.

758
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:55,285
You were stuck in
that amulet a long time.

759
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:59,055
You may still be 16,
but Esteban grew up.

760
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:00,757
     Wait. You're with her?

761
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:03,460
               I... I had
               no choice, Elena.

762
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:06,563
( laughs )
Is that so, Esteban?

763
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,698
           <i> Vadisima!</i>

764
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,734
           Seize her!

765
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,241
          ( panting )

766
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:20,510
           Found ya!

767
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:21,678
                        Oh!

768
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,848
        Uh, what's going on?

769
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,683
       Nothing, Armando.

770
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,852
    I'm just setting things
         back in order.

771
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:31,020
   Hey, not so fast, Shuriki!

772
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,021
           ( gasps )

773
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,324
         Hop on, Elena.

774
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,426
           No, wait.
      Don't leave, Skylar.

775
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:39,462
           <i> Vadisima! </i>
       Guards, stop them!

776
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,498
I want her captured
by nightfall.

777
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,932
Her and that
little princess.

778
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,701
        Leave Sofia out of this.

779
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:47,203
        And lock them up
      while you're at it.

780
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,938
    MIRANDA: Get your hands
            off me!

781
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,440
             You'll regret this.

782
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,674
          I doubt it.

783
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,444
          Wait. Wait.

784
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:56,212
  Skylar, we have to go back.

785
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,214
        Why? So she can
        finish you off?

786
00:41:58,216 --> 00:41:59,849
    You are brave, princess,

787
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,785
   but your battle strategy,
          not so good.

788
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,854
Elena, what happened?

789
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,890
    I tried my best, Sofia,

790
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:08,391
         but I couldn't
      get the spell right,

791
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:09,959
          and Shuriki
      has your family now.

792
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,694
       She has my family?

793
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,496
         I'm so sorry.

794
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,832
         There she is.
   Archers, lock your arrows.

795
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,734
             Draw!

796
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:19,836
         Whoa. They're
        shooting arrows!

797
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:21,971
        Evasive action.
        Dodge and weave.

798
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,540
    Yeah, we could do that.

799
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,141
           Or we could just
           get on up outta here.

800
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,043
    - We can go to my place.
       - Great. Hang on.

801
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,462
    Oh, I hope they're okay.

802
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:55,271
This is not okay, Roland.
Where is Sofia?

803
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:58,741
         I will get us
         out of here, Miranda,
         and we will find Sofia.

804
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,345
   The prisoners are secured,
      Chancellor Esteban.

805
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:04,614
  Those prisoners are royalty,

806
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:06,215
          and you will
      treat them as such.

807
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:08,017
Yes, chancellor.

808
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:11,621
           Ay yi yi.
 Yet another mess to clean up.

809
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:13,890
So Princess Elena lives.

810
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:16,025
                  Apparently so.

811
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,694
      She is the rightful
      heir to the throne.

812
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:19,128
                    We should be
                    helping her.

813
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,197
What do you suggest
<i>we</i> do, hmm?

814
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,866
Fight the queen?
Because we will lose.

815
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,868
           But Elena's
           your cousin, Esteban.

816
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,805
And her grandparents
raised me like a son.

817
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:31,207
And I think about
what happened to them
every day.

818
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,844
So I do not need you
to remind me, Armando.

819
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,901
            Elena, what happened
            back there?

820
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,474
I never knew
what happened

821
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:07,577
to my sister
and my grandparents
until today.

822
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:10,079
Seeing them trapped
in that painting

823
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,682
reminded me of
the last time I saw Isabel.

824
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:15,151
           - Isabel?
      - My little sister.

825
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,854
She'd been out in
the garden all day,

826
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,822
building a new feeder
for the jaquins.

827
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,858
        She was filthy,

828
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,993
      and our parents were
 on their way home for dinner,

829
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,828
   so I asked her to change.

830
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,930
       And she comes back
     wearing a clean dress,

831
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:32,135
     but her hands and face
   are still covered in dirt.

832
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:35,004
      I had just finished
        cleaning her off

833
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:39,275
   when I heard our parents'
   carriage pull up outside.

834
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,678
           And then,
        Shuriki arrived.

835
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,546
           I'm sorry.

836
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:46,649
       When I saw her in
 that enchanted painting today,

837
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,885
         she still had
     a smudge on her cheek.

838
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,787
    I guess I missed a spot.

839
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:53,222
       ( door creaking )

840
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:56,659
          We have the spell
          that can get them out.

841
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,027
            - We do?
            - We do.

842
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,396
Your grandfather
showed me where it was

843
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:03,366
before he left,
but I never learned magic,

844
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,168
so I cannot
cast the spell.

845
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,070
You will have
to do it, Mateo.

846
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:09,872
      And, uh, why would I
       be able to do it?

847
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,375
Mateo, you're down there
in the basement

848
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,544
practicing magic
day and night.

849
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,912
You think
I don't know this?

850
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,147
                But Elena,
                I must warn you.

851
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:21,350
     To bring them out
     with Shuriki still in power

852
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:23,352
                will put them
                in great danger.

853
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:25,988
    - ( horses approaching )
         - ( knocking )

854
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,025
       We have visitors.
    Quick, hide, over there.

855
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:32,628
         - ( knocking )
    - Okay. Coming, coming.

856
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,934
      Rafa, did you hear?

857
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:40,536
      They're saying that
  Princess Elena has returned.

858
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:43,539
           Oh, hurry.
      Hurry. Come inside.

859
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,575
     We have to be careful.

860
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,510
        Princess Elena,
           it's okay.

861
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:49,412
       We can trust them.

862
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,183
                     It is true.

863
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,052
      The princess lives!

864
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,120
          My princess.

865
00:45:57,122 --> 00:45:59,088
     You don't have to bow.

866
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,590
                 Oh, okay.

867
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,125
    We are at your command.

868
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:04,794
         I will take on
        Shuriki myself.

869
00:46:04,796 --> 00:46:06,696
           Thank you,
          all of you,

870
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:09,065
     but this is my fight,
           not yours.

871
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,801
          I'm the one
       who must face her.

872
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:15,805
      You may be the one,
  but you're not the only one.

873
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,641
    Zuzo said that, and now
     I know what he meant.

874
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:20,443
    Okay. What did he mean?

875
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,945
          We can all help.
          You don't need
          to face Shuriki alone.

876
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,248
    You just need to tell us
          what to do.

877
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,084
         Hmm. You know,
         all this time

878
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:30,787
   I was stuck in the amulet,
     I thought I was alone,

879
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:33,156
    but you're right, Sofia.
It doesn't have to be that way.

880
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:34,991
       I have all of you.

881
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:39,061
          Yeah, but what good
          are we against Shuriki
          and all her soldiers?

882
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,564
           I'm still
       figuring that out,

883
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,766
     but I'm going to need
        everyone's help.

884
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:45,601
       - We're with you.
       - All the way.

885
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:46,969
         Not just you.

886
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,704
           Everyone.

887
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,833
Where are we?

888
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:19,135
     A secret back entrance
         to the palace.

889
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:22,605
   Not that I ever snuck out
   when I wasn't supposed to.

890
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,317
        I'll see you at
 the rendezvous point, Skylar.

891
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,953
You better.

892
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:39,322
        How will we find
           my family?

893
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:41,724
      There's only one place
      Shuriki would've put them.

894
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:46,629
        Princess Elena?!

895
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:50,633
           Hey there.
    You look like a nice guy

896
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:52,535
      who just wants to do
        the right thing.

897
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:55,037
             I do?
         I mean, I do.

898
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,706
              Whatever you need,
              princess.

899
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,074
           I am at your service.

900
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,213
        Ahem. Excuse me,

901
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,716
       but Queen Shuriki
     wants the both of you

902
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,351
        to report to her
          right away.

903
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:11,254
            I'll go.
         You stay here.

904
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:13,923
No, but she asked
to see the both of you.

905
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,725
            One of us has to
            watch the prisoners.

906
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,994
           Um, wait.
            Hold on.

907
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,597
          That hurts.

908
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,267
     Oh, one of the guards
        wouldn't leave.

909
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:26,402
   Sofia, if you shrank down,

910
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,905
        you could sneak
     right past that guard.

911
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,606
         But you're not
     in my amulet anymore.

912
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,375
      Do you think I still
        have my powers?

913
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:34,410
      There's only one way
          to find out.

914
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,779
             I wish I was small.

915
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,082
 ( yells )

916
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,286
          Armando, I need you
          to distract the guard.

917
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,457
       Hello. Excuse me.
             Hello.

918
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:50,293
                 What is it now?

919
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:52,895
There's something
very, very important

920
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:54,597
I must tell you.
Over here.

921
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,002
    I wish to be big again.

922
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,411
             - Hi.
         - ALL: Sofia!

923
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:09,645
     Sh. We have to hurry.

924
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:11,080
         You have a lot
      of explaining to do.

925
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:13,816
     Mom, I will... later.
           I promise.

926
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:16,819
  But right now, we have to find
  a way to get past that guard.

927
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:19,088
I'll take care
of him.

928
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,557
And when the farmer
followed her into the jungle,

929
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,961
she turned into
a jaguar!

930
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,296
  This is the important thing
      you had to tell me?

931
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,265
You haven't heard
the ending yet.

932
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,133
                 Grab him!

933
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,837
        Got him!

934
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,339
                    Well done.

935
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,579
          Dad, this is
        Princess Elena.

936
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:46,315
    I'm sorry for the danger
     I put your family in.

937
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,184
        But I've waited
         so many years

938
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:51,087
for the one princess that could
    free me from the amulet,

939
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:52,989
      and that was Sofia.

940
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,791
I sensed it from
the very first day
she moved into your castle.

941
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:59,028
   So when I was picking out
     Sofia's welcome gift,

942
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,030
      it was you who made
        the amulet glow?

943
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:03,265
     Yes. I needed someone
          young enough

944
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:06,268
    to get close to Shuriki
 without making her suspicious,

945
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,637
  but brave and clever enough
         to get me out.

946
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,373
      So you shouldn't be
          mad at her.

947
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,375
      You should be proud.

948
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:14,543
   Sofia, you still should've
   told us what was going on.

949
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:17,446
    I know. I just wanted to
  keep you all out of trouble.

950
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,215
              Well, it's
              too late for that.

951
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:22,051
        I think a pardon
may be in order just this once.

952
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,353
    I have a plan to get you
         all to safety,

953
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,122
     but we have to hurry.

954
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:28,557
    I'm losing my patience,
            Esteban.

955
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,359
Where is Princess Elena?

956
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,229
         Queen Shuriki,
when I helped you invade Avalor,

957
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:36,665
  you promised me that no one
  in my family would be hurt.

958
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:40,169
I also promised you power,
and look at you now,

959
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:42,371
Chancellor Esteban.

960
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,875
      Just be happy I kept
      one of my promises,

961
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:48,744
or you'll wind up like
your aunt and uncle.

962
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,546
     You wanted to see me,
          Your Grace.

963
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:54,417
I don't want to see
anyone until those
princesses are found.

964
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:56,419
      Hey there, Shuriki.

965
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:58,354
       Long time no see.

966
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:02,391
 I've put up with you buzzards
 outside, but not in my palace.

967
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,427
But it's so comfy
in here.

968
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,495
       Ooh, here's a nice
         little perch.

969
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:07,897
       Get off my throne.

970
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,899
          -<i> Vadisima! </i>
          - Missed me!

971
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,600
Capture that beast.

972
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:13,836
      You heard the queen.
             Move!

973
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:15,304
                       Yes, sir.

974
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,079
   Okay, let's see the spell.

975
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:26,615
             Whoa.
     <i> Tlah...cui...lolli...?</i>

976
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,551
            Oh, boy,
    that's a tongue twister.

977
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:29,718
ELENA: Mateo!

978
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,987
                   Oh, it's you.

979
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,424
          Oh, Isabel!

980
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,026
      You have to get them
          out, Mateo.

981
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:38,594
                      Now.

982
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,895
           ( sighs )
             Okay.

983
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:42,465
     <i> Tlahcuilolli apartad.</i>

984
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,366
     <i> Tlahcuilolli apareced.</i>

985
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:46,702
      <i> Tlahcuilolli vivid!</i>

986
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,947
           - Isabel!
           - Elena!

987
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:00,282
           I missed you so much.

988
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,151
                  Let me just...

989
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:04,120
          You're safe.

990
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:06,555
         <i> Abuelo, abuela.</i>

991
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,926
    <i> ABUELO:</i> The palace looks
         so different.

992
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:13,796
  - What happened to Shuriki?
      - She's still here.

993
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:17,433
I never should've let
Alacazar put us in
that painting.

994
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:18,901
        Uh, can we talk
       about this later?

995
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:20,736
         We have to go.

996
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,741
        Everyone hurry.
        Get on a jaquin.

997
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,343
Whoa, princess.

998
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:29,311
You should've given me
a head count.

999
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,147
        Some of you may
       have to double up.

1000
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:34,250
    These jaquins will take
 your family back to your ship,

1001
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,751
        and we're taking
          the others.

1002
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,788
            Since when do people
            ride jaquins?

1003
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,691
     Don't get used to it.

1004
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:46,996
      I'm not running away
   from Shuriki again, Elena.

1005
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:49,932
We're not running
away,<i> abuela. </i>
You'll see.

1006
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,011
       I'm going to stay
        and help Elena.

1007
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:05,014
What? If I knew that,
I would've gotten on
another bird thingy.

1008
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,315
    We should help, too, Rollie.

1009
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,350
          I intend to,
        but the children

1010
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,885
   should return to the ship
        where it's safe.

1011
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:11,353
      We'll be okay, Dad.

1012
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,189
       We won't be alone.
       Everyone's coming.

1013
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:15,524
   ROLAND: What do you mean,
           everyone?

1014
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:21,363
         MAN: Come on.
   We're going to the castle.

1015
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,499
         - Viva Avalor!
      - ALL: Viva Avalor!

1016
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:27,303
       ( all chattering )

1017
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,045
         Hey, Shuriki.

1018
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:38,047
      I'm getting a little
   lonely up here. ( laughs )

1019
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:40,583
          You again.
           <i> Vadisima!</i>

          ( screams )
           Too slow.

          - ( laughs )

1022
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,421
        Missed me again.

1023
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:46,889
    You're gonna have to aim
        better than that

1024
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,390
    if you're gonna zap me.

1025
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,660
     Oh, I will, you pest.
          <i> Vadisima!</i>

1026
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:53,529
          Oh. Uh-huh.

1027
00:53:53,531 --> 00:53:55,064
      Nice shot, Shuriki.

1028
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,199
    Well, it's been a blast
        distracting you,

1029
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,201
     - but I'm outta here.
       - Distracting me?

1030
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,170
      What is she talking
        about, Esteban?

1031
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:03,005
      - ( voices nearby )
            - What?

1032
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,907
      What is that sound?

1033
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,377
        They're coming,
         Your Majesty.

            Shuriki.

1073
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,564
    It's ours, and you can't
        stop all of us.

1074
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,666
        I don't have to.

1075
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:46,435
          I only need
          to stop you.

1076
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,405
                        Esteban!

1077
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,672
             What are you doing?

1078
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:52,741
Elena, catch.

1079
00:56:56,513 --> 00:57:00,949
   Ha! You can't use the wand
          on me, girl.

1080
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:05,788
    Maybe so, but let's see
how powerful you are without it.

1081
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,653
      Shuriki, your reign
            is over.

1082
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:39,655
        ( all gasping )

1083
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:41,990
              No.
          ( sobbing )

1084
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,371
       She's gone, Elena.
            We won.

1085
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,275
          After all these years.

1086
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:03,445
   All hail the rightful heir
           of Avalor,

1087
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:05,614
        Princess Elena!

1088
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:07,749
      ( people cheering )

1089
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:09,785
      Wait. I'm in charge
      of the kingdom now?

1090
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:11,520
   You are the eldest child.

1091
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:13,856
     The crown goes to you.

1092
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:14,990
            It does?

1093
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:18,694
You will be
a great ruler, Elena.

1094
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,629
And you'll have
your grandfather and I

1095
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:23,499
to help you,
so there's nothing
to worry about.

1096
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,968
       Now go and address
          your people.

1097
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,804
             Right.
       Address my people.

1098
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:31,206
             Okay.

1099
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:34,776
           Hello. Hi.

1100
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:37,112
          How are you?
           Hey there.

1101
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:40,349
                 And thank you
                 for everything.

1102
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:43,886
Elena, I guess
this belongs to you.

1103
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:46,388
               Sofia, I want you
               to have it,

1104
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,390
             for all you've done
             for Avalor.

1105
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:50,726
      Besides, I think I've
      seen enough of that amulet

1106
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:52,794
                 for a lifetime.

1107
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:54,963
    Thank you, Elena.

1108
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,240
              Thank you, cousin.

1109
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:07,509
     For a moment, I wasn't sure
     whose side you were on.

1110
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:10,212
I was always
on our side,

1111
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:13,515
but I couldn't let
Shuriki find a way
to destroy that painting.

1112
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:15,317
Our family was in there.

1113
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:17,753
And so, I pretended
to follow her

1114
00:59:17,755 --> 00:59:19,922
to keep them safe.

1115
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:22,758
I hope you understand, Elena.

1116
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,337
            - Elena!
             - Isa!

1117
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,073
       Any time you need
       a ride, princess,

1118
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:12,975
        I'm your jaquin.

1119
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,911
         Let every bell
        in Avalor ring.

1120
01:00:15,913 --> 01:00:17,779
          We are free!

1121
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,048
       ( bells tolling )

1122
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,551
        - How was that?
            - Great.

1123
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,794
     SOFIA:<i> "And all across</i>
          <i> the kingdom,</i>

1124
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,930
      <i> the people of Avalor</i>
            <i> cheered,</i>

1125
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:38,900
    <i> for their lost princess</i>
     <i> had finally come home.</i>

1126
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:42,804
      Thus began the reign
       of Princess Elena,

1127
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,974
     and with it, a new age
     of joy and prosperity

1128
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,843
      for all of Avalor."

1129
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:49,011
Wonderful.

1130
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:52,814
I would call that
a very happy ending.

1131
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,951
    It is, but I don't think
  her story is over just yet.

1132
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,986
             Of course it isn't,

1133
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:01,023
     but what happens next
     is a tale for another book.

1134
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,868
         Thank you for
   all you have done, Sofia.

1135
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:17,039
              And this is for
              the journey ahead.

1136
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:39,061
Which brings me to this.

1137
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:40,862
I need to figure out

1138
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,964
what to do with
the pieces of her wand.

1139
01:01:42,966 --> 01:01:45,634
         Well, you could just
         toss 'em off the cliff.

1140
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:48,904
I was thinking of
something a little more secure.

1141
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:51,139
            I know.
          You could...

1142
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,875
         No, that's too obvious.

1143
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,510
                     Hmm.

1144
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:57,646
    I know. We can hide them
        in the treasury,

1145
01:01:57,648 --> 01:02:00,882
      and not tell anyone
        where we put it.

1146
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:04,519
Yes. It'll be
the best-guarded
secret in Avalor.

1147
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:06,088
Thanks, Naomi.

1148
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:09,691
       What are friends
       and Grand Counselors for?

1149
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:12,561
( laughs )
So, should we
head back down?

1150
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,329
     Are you sure you don't
        need more rest?

1151
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:16,098
     You are 57, after all.

1152
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,066
           ( laughs )

1153
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,935
    Well, as my<i> abuela</i> says,

1154
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:22,704
 time spent in magical jewelry
         doesn't count.

1155
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:23,939
       Then we better go.

1156
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,941
         The kingdom's
     not gonna rule itself.

1157
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,110
             Right.
