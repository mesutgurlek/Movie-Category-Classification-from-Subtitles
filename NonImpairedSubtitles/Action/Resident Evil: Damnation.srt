1
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:24,185
<i>For 74 years, the might</i>
<i>of Soviet socialism was so great...</i>

2
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,585
<i>... it split the world...</i>

3
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,657
<i>... along Eastern and Western lines.</i>

4
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:32,594
<i>Then, in 1991,</i>
<i>it collapsed completely.</i>

5
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,735
<i>One by one, the various countries</i>
<i>which had supported the Soviet Union...</i>

6
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,302
<i>... began splitting away...</i>

7
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,336
<i>... declaring their independence.</i>

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,765
<i>The parliament</i>
<i>of the Eastern Slav Republic...</i>

9
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,578
<i>... followed suit, declaring</i>
<i>the country a sovereign state...</i>

10
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,715
<i>... independent from Soviet rule.</i>

11
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,047
<i>Capitalism advanced rapidly.</i>

12
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,210
<i>The conglomerates gained influence</i>
<i>in political circles...</i>

13
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,322
<i>... and as a result,</i>
<i>the oligarchs came into power.</i>

14
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,286
<i>In the Eastern Slav Republic...</i>

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,293
<i>... the divide between rich and poor</i>
<i>became so great...</i>

16
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,455
<i>... it ignited the fuse</i>
<i>of a new rebellion.</i>

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,391
<i>The push for independence...</i>

18
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>... exploded into the streets.</i>

19
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,965
<i>Armed freedom fighters pitted</i>
<i>themselves against their government...</i>

20
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,735
<i>... now controlled by the oligarchs.</i>

21
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,275
<i>The military prospered</i>
<i>during this time...</i>

22
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,042
<i>... becoming ever stronger</i>
<i>and better equipped.</i>

23
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,412
<i>Under the guidance</i>
<i>of Ivan Judanovich...</i>

24
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,747
<i>... an Ataman</i>
<i>from the Council of Elders...</i>

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,947
<i>... the freedom fighters</i>
<i>moved their base...</i>

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,789
<i>... to a hidden location.</i>

27
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,460
<i>A more suitable place to launch...</i>

28
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,062
<i>... their guerrilla war</i>
<i>against the government.</i>

29
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,324
<i>After several years</i>
<i>of brutal fighting...</i>

30
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,436
<i>... it was Svetlana Belikova...</i>

31
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,902
<i>... Eastern Slav's</i>
<i>first female president...</i>

32
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,236
<i>... who offered a ceasefire</i>
<i>to the freedom fighters.</i>

33
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,436
<i>But the break from hostilities</i>
<i>was short-lived.</i>

34
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,447
<i>In November of 2010,</i>
<i>the government discovered...</i>

35
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,450
<i>... that the rebels' land</i>
<i>contained valuable resources.</i>

36
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,645
<i>The military continued</i>
<i>their attacks...</i>

37
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,290
<i>... claiming they were</i>
<i>fighting terrorism.</i>

38
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,523
<i>Losing one base after another</i>
<i>to the military's onslaught...</i>

39
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,324
<i>... the freedom fighters</i>
<i>escalated their efforts...</i>

40
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,263
<i>... and became more and more</i>
<i>radical in their tactics.</i>

41
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,299
<i>It was then that strange rumors...</i>

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,098
<i>... began spreading like wildfire</i>
<i>among the people...</i>

43
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,670
<i>... that monsters had joined the battle.</i>

44
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,775
<i>In February of 2011...</i>

45
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,675
<i>... the rumors made it to</i>
<i>the old city of Holifgrad...</i>

46
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,715
<i>... just a few kilometers</i>
<i>from the Presidential Palace...</i>

47
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,853
<i>... an important strategic location</i>
<i>for the government.</i>

48
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,198
<i>Listen to the words of the elders.</i>

49
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:57,534
<i>We have finally gained</i>
<i>the power that we need.</i>

50
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,541
<i>Power that will lead us to victory.</i>

51
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,544
<i>Gather, people.</i>

52
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,686
<i>Gather and fight.</i>

53
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,684
<i>Fight for independence!</i>

54
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,268
Retreat! We're getting slaughtered!

55
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,202
Another rebel!

56
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,871
<i>- Do not resist arrest.</i>
- Retreat!

57
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,173
<i>Drop your weapons.</i>

58
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,713
<i>- Surrender immediately.</i>
- Government pigs!

59
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,408
<i>I repeat, do not resist arrest.</i>

60
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,780
<i>Surrender immediately.</i>

61
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,205
Moving into position.

62
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,302
<i>Copy.</i>

63
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,310
I've got a clear view
of you from the sky.

64
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:13,876
Great.

65
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:17,318
Maybe you can help me find
a clear route to the CIA drop-off.

66
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,293
Looks like they're doing some
serious renovations down here.

67
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,266
<i>Listen to me carefully, Leon.</i>

68
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,302
<i>Your mission has been aborted.</i>

69
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,237
<i>The U.S. Is going to pull out</i>
<i>of the country.</i>

70
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,434
What? I just got here.

71
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,840
After taking me off furlough
and sending me to this...

72
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,308
...godforsaken place?

73
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,813
What the hell?

74
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,919
<i>Washington and the government there</i>
<i>have decided to go their separate ways.</i>

75
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,453
<i>Everyone has to leave,</i>
<i>not just embassy staff.</i>

76
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,423
<i>All American citizens have been</i>
<i>ordered to evacuate the country.</i>

77
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,492
I don't give a damn
about the politics.

78
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,962
We've got confirmation that B.O.W.s
are being used in this war.

79
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,623
If we don't stop them now...

80
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,928
...the same shit will
happen everywhere.

81
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,866
Do you really wanna see that?

82
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,506
This is a war
and things are different.

83
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,008
No one can do anything without backup
from the American government.

84
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,202
Not even you.

85
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,143
Well, then I guess
my only option is to...

86
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,716
...lose my American
citizenship for a while.

87
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:19,874
<i>Leon!</i>

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,153
She can tell them I got lost
and missed my flight.

89
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,890
Better hurry up and get this done.

90
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,858
I need some breakfast.

91
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,383
Scarecrow.

92
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,317
I'm the Tin Man.
Can you talk?

93
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,392
What's the connection between the
anti-government forces and the B.O.W.s?

94
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,400
I guess scarecrows
aren't known...

95
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,125
...for rousing
conversation.

96
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,392
Hang in there.

97
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,970
I'll get you out of here.

98
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,572
Bee...

99
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,241
What?

100
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,836
Say that again.

101
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,774
Bee...

102
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,715
...keeper.
- Beekeeper?

103
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,983
The honeybee I saw outside.

104
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,335
Great. Now I got
a cowardly lion to deal with.

105
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,909
It's the army.

106
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,809
Is anyone here?

107
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,614
Check the room down there.

108
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,824
Hey...

109
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,691
Don't say a word.

110
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,301
How about that one?

111
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,710
This one's clear.

112
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:56,979
Clear.

113
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,618
This one's clear. We're moving on.

114
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,054
Pull out.

115
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,687
They're gone.

116
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,729
We better stay here a while longer.

117
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,502
They may come back

118
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,210
Do you think our hostage...

119
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,574
...will be of any use?

120
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,744
Do you know who we are?

121
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,552
Are you Dorothy?

122
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,181
You people in the CIA
call us terrorists.

123
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,322
But we prefer to call ourselves...

124
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,889
...pro-independence fighters.

125
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,759
What is the CIA doing here?

126
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,363
Did you put the government
up to this?

127
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,938
Are there any more of you?

128
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,540
I'm not a CIA agent.

129
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,769
I'm just an American who was
screwed out of his vacation...

130
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,071
...dumped on a plane
and brought here.

131
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,271
Without breakfast.

132
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,081
They came for you
while you were on vacation?

133
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,275
Hey, Buddy.

134
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,217
He's got to be high up
in the CIA for them to do that.

135
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,114
You watch too many movies.

136
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,758
Then what are you?

137
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,894
Is it common for people in America...

138
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,586
...to be packing one of these
while on vacation?

139
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,124
Sure. We've been doing it since
the country was founded.

140
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,792
Wow, America's the bomb, yo.

141
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,133
Whatever.

142
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,207
But even if you're not CIA...

143
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,071
...there is no doubt you
must be pretty special...

144
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,645
...for America to send you here.

145
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,644
You were able to take on
that thing, after all.

146
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,149
If you don't stop messing around
with that thing...

147
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,049
...you're gonna get us all killed.

148
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,817
There is no doubt about the fact
that you are our enemy.

149
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,132
<i>An anti-terrorist sweep</i>
<i>is now in operation.</i>

150
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,503
<i>Civilians should avoid...</i>

151
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,611
<i>... going outside</i>
<i>as much as possible.</i>

152
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,147
<i>If you see</i>
<i>any suspicious people or behavior...</i>

153
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,648
<i>... report it to the authorities</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

154
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,623
Status.

155
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,027
Some escaped underground.

156
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,598
But it's only a matter of time
before they are rounded up.

157
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,132
Tell me in more detail.

158
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,929
When, exactly?

159
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,799
Well...

160
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,365
...you see...

161
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:34,706
How many times are you going
to make the same mistake?

162
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:41,981
We should have become a member
of the United Nations five years ago.

163
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,649
And by now be a respected member...

164
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,885
...of the international community
in our role as an EU nation.

165
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,892
But before that could happen...

166
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,123
...another group came crawling
out of the sewers...

167
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,737
...screaming their declarations
of separatism.

168
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,735
And the main cause of this...

169
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:05,866
...is because you allowed
the terrorists to do as they please.

170
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,810
If we don't act soon...

171
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:14,646
...we will lose our chance
for true independence forever.

172
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,180
And we cannot
allow that to happen...

173
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,689
...at any cost.

174
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,186
Madam President.

175
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,764
Your visitor has arrived.

176
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,059
Show her in.

177
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,575
Welcome to Eastern Slav, my dear.

178
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,111
I am President Svetlana Belikova.

179
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,115
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce you
to our guest.

180
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,913
This young lady
is a special investigator...

181
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,922
...for the United Nations'
Bioterrorism Security Alliance.

182
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,756
Good day, Madam President.

183
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:56,952
Gentlemen.

184
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,859
I have been sent here by the BSAA.

185
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,796
My name is Ada Wong.

186
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,448
Hey, you.

187
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,753
My name is not, "Hey, you."

188
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,787
I'm JD.

189
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,922
Although that's not my real name.

190
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,091
The old man's
not looking too good.

191
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,954
He always looks like that.

192
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,090
Let's hope you're right.

193
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,971
Anyways, what are you
really doing in this country?

194
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,304
Hey, a different question
for a change.

195
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,636
What I mean is...

196
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,145
...being in America
is a lot more fun than...

197
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,442
...being here, right?

198
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,845
I wouldn't know.

199
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,451
The hamburgers, man.

200
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,644
The fried chicken.

201
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,516
Food in your country's fantastic.

202
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,417
I could eat it every day.

203
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,654
Thanks for the valuable insight.

204
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,522
And the Hollywood movies.

205
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,162
I love those things.

206
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,094
I have 50 DVDs.

207
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,631
None of them are pirated.

208
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,200
I thought you guys hated America.

209
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,860
Sure, we hate it.

210
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,433
But things made in America?

211
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,097
Now that's different.

212
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,517
Whatever you do...

213
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,186
...don't push that button.

214
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,218
I'm not falling for that.

215
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,553
No way I'll allow them
to trace the call.

216
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,202
How are things out there?

217
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,397
Looks like they have the old part
of the city surrounded.

218
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,972
We'd better wait and see
how things pan out.

219
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,412
<i>Bio Organic Weapons.</i>

220
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,172
<i>Also known as...</i>

221
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,975
...B.O.W.s.

222
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,176
Most developed countries
and the United Nations...

223
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,880
...are against the use
and manufacture of B.O.W.s.

224
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,389
However, they are, unfortunately...

225
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,153
...still traded on
the world's black markets.

226
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,589
From a quick glance at this report...

227
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,165
...I'd say that using these weapons
in a real conflict...

228
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,599
...would be extremely
impractical, no?

229
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,767
There's no way to differentiate...

230
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,907
...between friend and foe.

231
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,043
It is true that total control...

232
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,269
...of most of the B.O.W.s...

233
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,108
...has been nearly impossible
up until now.

234
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,279
But a new technology
that changes that fact...

235
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,921
...has recently been developed.

236
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,351
Tell me more.

237
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,284
Recent technological
advancements...

238
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:46,295
...can establish
a master/slave relationship...

239
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,525
...between a human and the B.O.W.s.

240
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,759
So?

241
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,801
What do they do, crack whips at it?

242
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,734
Like they do with wild animals?

243
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,767
Not exactly.

244
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,872
Organisms, designed to determine...

245
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:06,313
...whether a host is to be
a controller or a controlee...

246
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,579
...take up residence
within the host's body...

247
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,657
...and creates the perfect
master/slave relationship...

248
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,588
...between a human
and the B.O.W.

249
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,087
Similar to the relationship...

250
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,857
...a queen bee shares
with her worker bees.

251
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,275
Yo, bro.
Can I speak to you for a moment?

252
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,746
What about?

253
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,748
It's about Ataman.

254
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,012
It could be dangerous
to move him now.

255
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,817
And your American friend's
also taken quite an interest in him.

256
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,792
You don't...

257
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,024
You don't have to worry about me.

258
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,833
We can't stay here forever.

259
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,041
Who's in there?
Open the door.

260
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,170
- Anyone there?
- Open the door.

261
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,713
Open up! Stop resisting...

262
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,283
...and come out.
- Step back.

263
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,817
Three, two...

264
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,012
...one!

265
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,654
Don't move. Hands in the air.
Don't move.

266
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,660
- Stay still.
- Don't shoot.

267
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,299
Drop your guns!

268
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,665
Let's go. Take them away.

269
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,180
Keep away from him!

270
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,154
He's turned.

271
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,518
Downstairs.

272
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,122
Someone's in the basement.

273
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,918
Shoot. Shoot!

274
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,890
Quick, run!

275
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,123
Are you all right?

276
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,590
Ataman.

277
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,629
We have to hurry.

278
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,232
They'll be here soon.

279
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,660
You...

280
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,737
...go on ahead.

281
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,465
Damn, just when things
were going well.

282
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,840
We can win this war...

283
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,273
...can't we?

284
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,743
JD.

285
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,075
It's... It's time...

286
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,150
...for me to go.

287
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,447
But I'll be rooting for you...

288
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,612
...from heaven.

289
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,154
Get up, you idiot. You think that vest
you're wearing is a girl's blouse?

290
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,126
We have to get Ataman
away from here.

291
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,837
I should have guessed.

292
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,098
Made in America.

293
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,832
Wait.

294
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,476
Where's the American?

295
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,077
Dead, probably.

296
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,447
Give me a hand.

297
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,953
Leave me here.

298
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,123
If we go on like this...

299
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,024
...we'll all be killed...

300
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,163
...before we can launch
an attack...

301
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,992
...on the capital.

302
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,727
Go.

303
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,000
Create a new future.

304
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,298
- This way. I heard gunshots.
- They're here.

305
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,768
I'm going to go
and check on Marco.

306
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,732
You head to the church
and join the others.

307
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,607
Okay.

308
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,080
Do you really think
I'm gonna fall for that?

309
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,490
- Kill you.
- Do I look like I need a pruning?

310
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,921
Don't kill him.

311
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,929
That's one request I can't grant.

312
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,239
Mr. Chenkov.

313
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,037
I told you not to kill him.

314
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,235
- He was my teacher.
- It was him or me.

315
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,211
And don't forget...

316
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,350
...he wasn't your teacher anymore.

317
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,594
Shoot.

318
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,038
Shoot, JD.

319
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:13,193
Why the hell carry that gun around
if you're not gonna use it?

320
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,794
Don't worry.

321
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,799
I'll use it next time.

322
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:39,014
If you ever decide to shoot those things,
shoot them in the head, got it?

323
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,483
Wait.

324
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,155
This way.

325
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,521
Two grown men
should be able to open it.

326
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,253
So, what is this place?

327
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,489
Old partisans used to
hole up here...

328
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,758
...back in the day.

329
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,231
They sure knew
how to keep the enemy out.

330
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,535
This thing ain't gonna budge.

331
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,771
Stand back.

332
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,473
That way.

333
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,984
This way.

334
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,403
Quick.

335
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,428
Oh, I knew I should have...

336
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,896
...stayed off the...

337
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,432
...junk food.

338
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,638
Hurry up.

339
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,806
- Get him.
- No.

340
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,809
Get away.

341
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,477
- Get him.
- Stay away from me.

342
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,608
Get him.

343
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,878
No.

344
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,753
- No. No!
- Get him.

345
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,524
Please, somebody help me.
Help me!

346
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,788
What's happening?

347
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,258
Stay away! No!

348
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,770
Get away!

349
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,167
Help!

350
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,438
What happened to everybody?

351
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,075
Anywhere we can hide?

352
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:32,977
Hey.

353
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,250
Yeah.

354
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,529
What did you do to everybody?

355
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,893
The Plaga you were hiding got loose.

356
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,968
I don't know
what you're talking about!

357
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,230
Your precious townsfolk
are being controlled by a parasite.

358
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,070
It attaches itself to the central
nervous system via the spinal cord.

359
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,971
The people of the town are...?

360
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,170
They'll never be normal again.

361
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:42,182
- There must be something we can do.
- Rip out the spinal cord...

362
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,345
...but the best you could hope for
is paralysis or death.

363
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,512
You are lying!

364
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:50,182
If you really believe that,
then why did you kill the old man?

365
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,858
But that was...

366
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,659
Because you knew he would
never be human again.

367
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,600
What he says is true.

368
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,835
I have some more questions for you.

369
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,452
Maybe this time
we can get to the truth.

370
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,739
What are we going to do?

371
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,309
- I have to go and get it.
- Go and get it?

372
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,540
Why?

373
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,617
We need somebody
to take over for Ataman.

374
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,389
You've seen what's
happening outside.

375
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,457
Do you want that to happen to you?

376
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,394
What we do today will carry
the country into tomorrow.

377
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,895
But even so...

378
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,769
I'll meet up with the others
tomorrow to plan...

379
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,965
...an attack on the
Presidential Palace.

380
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,741
Get ready for that.

381
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,947
I'll be back soon.

382
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,044
I want a word with him.

383
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,823
- He's gone to get it.
- The Plaga?

384
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,557
I don't know its name.

385
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:13,500
All I know is that it was
given to us by the elders.

386
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,874
You inject that stuff into your body
to control the Lickers, right?

387
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,179
Some compassionate elders
you got there.

388
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,151
What other options do we have?

389
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,757
Do you realize
that the whole world ignores us?

390
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,950
That we are in danger
of extermination?

391
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,223
Save your breath.

392
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,093
We're not gonna see
eye to eye on this.

393
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,195
Help us.

394
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,596
I don't want to see him
change into a monster.

395
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,035
Irina would not be happy about this.

396
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,480
Irina?

397
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,214
We knew her since we were kids.

398
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,216
Buddy's fiancée.

399
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:07,052
She was a schoolteacher
and believe it or not...

400
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,352
...so was Buddy.

401
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,858
Bastards thought their school...

402
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,589
...was a pro-independence hideout
and attacked it.

403
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,193
Irina and the kids died in the attack.

404
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,715
<i>That's the reason</i>
<i>why he's fighting this war.</i>

405
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,128
<i>He had never even held</i>
<i>a gun up until then.</i>

406
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,082
I'm going to pretend you escaped.

407
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:19,253
In return, you must get
ahold of it before he does.

408
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,160
So now you trust me?

409
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,262
I don't know who or what you are...

410
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,871
...but I do know that
you saved my life.

411
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,375
You must stop Sasha.

412
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,486
You'll find him
in the central marketplace.

413
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,862
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

414
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,726
The operation begins at 2000 hours.

415
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,425
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

416
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,504
Looking for someone?

417
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,614
Ada.

418
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,099
It's been a long time, Leon.

419
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,205
What are you doing here?

420
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,943
I was about to ask you the same thing.

421
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,238
Did you release the Plaga?

422
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,309
Don't make me laugh.

423
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,216
I'm not interested
in defective products.

424
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,079
I'm just here to lend them a hand.

425
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,953
Them?

426
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:03,155
Although it seems as if
my help wasn't needed.

427
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,328
What are you doing here?

428
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,196
If they attack the capital...

429
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,491
...it'll make my job a lot easier.

430
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,030
That's all.

431
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,731
By the way...

432
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,536
...when are we going to carry on...

433
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,766
...from where we left off that night?

434
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,139
Any time but now.

435
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,942
You're angry with me, aren't you?

436
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,249
Suits you.

437
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,390
Quick word of warning.

438
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,755
This town will be purged soon!

439
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:47,830
Women.

440
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,582
General?

441
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,079
Yes.

442
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,556
You may start the attack
when you are ready.

443
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,056
Thank you.

444
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,061
Bring Ada Wong to me.
She should see this.

445
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,534
Great. I get to play Santa Claus.

446
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,184
Are you all right?

447
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,128
Yeah, just let my guard
down for a moment.

448
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,765
They got us pretty good.

449
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,476
- Where's Buddy?
- He already left by the time I got there.

450
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,815
- Damn!
- We have to leave now.

451
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,287
The military's gonna
burn the whole area...

452
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,948
...and everything in it.

453
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,459
- What?
- We're out of time.

454
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,526
What's wrong?

455
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,066
Nothing.

456
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,299
There's just something I have to do.

457
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,030
Won't you be needing that?

458
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,046
You my man.

459
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,680
Buddy.

460
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,758
Cool. You're still human.

461
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,225
JD.

462
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,026
You. What have you done?

463
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,373
No. He's not our enemy. He's...

464
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:45,803
I'm fine. Just go.

465
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:50,636
I don't want to cause any more trouble.

466
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,551
It's time to say goodbye.

467
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,630
JD!

468
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,895
Wait.

469
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:32,451
You know, I didn't really care
about independence.

470
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:38,351
All I wanted was to have fun
with you and my friends.

471
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,859
And...

472
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,653
I was looking forward
to showing you America.

473
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,360
Trust me...

474
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,595
...I've seen this happen every time.

475
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,314
When you're dealing with B.O.W.s...

476
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,181
...there's no difference
between friend or enemy.

477
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,682
It takes everything from you...

478
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,919
...the cause you're fighting for,
the respect you have for others.

479
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,222
We have to keep this from
ever happening again.

480
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,365
Give me the Plaga.

481
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:59,068
As far as I am concerned...

482
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:04,503
...there is no difference between
this and using B.O.W.s.

483
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,721
If you want to keep this
from happening again...

484
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,020
...put down your gun.

485
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,861
Well, then.

486
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,393
That is my answer...

487
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,905
...and your answer.

488
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,964
The eradication of the B.O.W.s
is moving ahead according to plan.

489
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,063
You mustn't allow even one of them
to escape the city.

490
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:04,296
We are prepared for all
eventualities, madam.

491
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:07,443
And one more thing,
regarding Ada Wong.

492
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,503
Did you find anything out?

493
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:13,412
There is no one working for the BSAA
by the name of Ada Wong.

494
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,182
Are you serious?

495
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,014
Yes, madam.

496
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,983
Of course.

497
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:41,871
<i>Central gate.</i>

498
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,205
<i>Report your status.</i>

499
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,847
Central gate reporting.

500
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,710
- All is calm.
<i>- Roger.</i>

501
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,851
<i>Keep your eyes peeled.</i>

502
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,149
<i>Three trucks are approaching.</i>

503
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,053
<i>Heads up, everyone.</i>

504
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,305
Halt. Halt.

505
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,413
Where did you go last night?

506
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,346
You were not in the hotel.

507
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,681
I went to meet an old friend.

508
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,047
And this old friend...

509
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,227
...is he a spy?

510
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:12,363
Who are you working for?
The Russians?

511
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,299
The Americans?

512
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,905
I'll leave that to your imagination.

513
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:20,904
Considering that you will never be
leaving this country again...

514
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,946
...I would say it is in your best interests
to stay on my good side.

515
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,483
Very funny.

516
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:27,944
So it's true what they said
about you being a former instructor.

517
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,676
Former? I still am an instructor.

518
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,021
Yes?

519
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:24,065
The terrorists broke through
the central gate.

520
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,942
As I said, we have decided
to delay your departure.

521
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,601
Permanently.

522
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,426
Now, that's impressive.

523
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,724
I keep saying
these things make bad pets.

524
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,131
<i>We are under attack by terrorists.</i>

525
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,498
<i>We need reinforcements, now!</i>

526
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,641
<i>We can't defend</i>
<i>the palace much longer.</i>

527
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,078
Sorry, but I don't have time to stay
and chat right now.

528
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,465
Amateurs.

529
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:22,297
They didn't even
give me a pat-down.

530
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,328
I didn't expect to get into
this place so easily.

531
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,808
Pretty impressive for...

532
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,377
...an old nuclear shelter.

533
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,182
So you missed me?

534
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:55,593
Yeah. In your dreams.

535
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:58,294
You seeing what I'm seeing?

536
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:03,438
It's like a beehive.

537
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,616
Have you looked inside
one of these?

538
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:22,720
It's the Plaga.

539
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,126
Big surprise.

540
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,396
Workers have been
cultivated in the past.

541
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,436
But this...

542
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,434
This is the first time that
the dominant members...

543
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:43,374
...of the species have been cultured.

544
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,271
What are you doing?

545
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:49,316
I'm working.
Don't worry about it.

546
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,611
Oh, I'm worried.

547
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,254
Enough!

548
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:05,060
So this is what you're here for.

549
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,326
Well?

550
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:07,594
Are you satisfied?

551
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,103
Yes, thank you very much.

552
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,442
Who is he?

553
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,736
I don't know.

554
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,136
He's an American agent.

555
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,275
Well, now that we got that
out of the way...

556
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:22,807
An American?

557
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,987
You'd better watch out...

558
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,419
...old broad's got a bite
worse than her bark.

559
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:29,615
Say what?

560
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,095
Over there! Over there! Shoot!

561
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,830
Cease fire! Cease fire!

562
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,939
Cease fire!

563
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,119
Don't move.

564
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,662
Do you have any idea...

565
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,304
...who you are pointing your gun at?

566
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:18,633
Yeah, let me see.

567
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,832
You're the beekeeper.

568
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,568
The beekeeper?

569
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:25,339
The person who released the Plaga.

570
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:30,476
Just as I thought, you haven't a clue.

571
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:34,350
I am the president of this country.

572
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,010
So that's what Ada meant.

573
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:58,477
He is an enemy of the state. Kill him!

574
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,092
<i>Creatures broke through...</i>

575
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:18,756
<i>... the cargo entrance!</i>
<i>They're heading your way!</i>

576
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,132
Open fire!

577
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,242
Cease fire. Cease fire.

578
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,275
Help me!

579
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,785
Fall back!

580
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,838
Did you use it?

581
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:17,009
Get him.

582
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,750
I'm sorry.

583
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,552
I couldn't stop him.

584
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:41,800
You bastard!

585
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,334
Help!

586
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:42,396
What will you gain by killing me?

587
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,798
Have you thought this through?

588
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,494
Who will lead the country
once you gain independence?

589
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,002
You?

590
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,039
I have no intention of taking advice...

591
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,302
...from a pretender to the throne.

592
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,675
In case you're interested...

593
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,146
...all of the elders,
with the exception of Ataman...

594
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,218
...have already come over to my side.

595
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:09,217
They all said they would be happy
to renege on independence...

596
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:12,225
...once I promised
to share the oil profits with them.

597
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:14,386
That's not possible.

598
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,726
Yes, that's what I thought.

599
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,198
But I'm afraid it's true.

600
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,234
Shut up!

601
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:30,241
While we have been wasting time here,
things have been happening in the world.

602
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,750
We don't have time
to fight amongst ourselves...

603
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,752
...in this tiny little country.

604
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,888
Shut up!

605
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:05,442
Oh, great. It just keeps getting better.

606
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,928
We have to go.

607
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:38,005
Svetlana!

608
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,953
<i>A biohazard release</i>
<i>has been detected.</i>

609
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,116
<i>Evacuate. Evacuate.</i>

610
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:57,523
<i>The incineration of the facility</i>
<i>will begin shortly.</i>

611
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,678
Run!

612
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:00,885
Why is it doing that?

613
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,619
You owe me one.

614
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,940
Why are you helping me?

615
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,512
Don't get all sentimental on me.

616
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:02,182
I'm not doing this for you.

617
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:08,650
There's nobody else left to tell the world
what really happened, that's why.

618
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:19,725
The hatch!

619
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:37,814
This will take us up.

620
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:47,558
Damn it.

621
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:50,294
Hurry.

622
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,268
Come on.

623
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,593
Let's get going.

624
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,877
<i>This is an announcement...</i>

625
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:41,083
<i>... from the government</i>
<i>of the Eastern Slav Republic.</i>

626
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,913
<i>We are under attack by terrorists.</i>

627
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,553
<i>Biochemical weapons...</i>

628
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,086
<i>... may have been used.</i>

629
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,589
<i>You are ordered</i>
<i>to evacuate the city immediately.</i>

630
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,557
<i>Please keep a distance</i>
<i>of five kilometers...</i>

631
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,219
<i>... from the capital.</i>

632
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,263
Excuse me.

633
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,562
Yes, what is it?

634
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,067
Forces have been
evacuated from the city...

635
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,969
...to escape the B.O.W.s
released by the terrorists.

636
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:11,977
However it appears the two in the shelter
have managed to escape.

637
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:16,650
Why are you wasting my time
telling me this?

638
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,754
Just let the you-know-what
get rid of them.

639
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,947
I'll see to it immediately.

640
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,130
Help me!

641
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,312
Nice work, pal.

642
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:08,673
Get out of there!

643
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,249
You really shouldn't have done that.

644
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,857
You really want to fight this out, huh?

645
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:48,875
Sorry for butting in.

646
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:03,521
You can run, but you can't hide.

647
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,131
Come on. Don't be shy.

648
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:27,075
Now!

649
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,641
This might hurt a little.

650
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,651
I didn't expect to be saved...

651
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:15,420
...by B.O.W.s.

652
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,775
Wanna go grab a few beers?

653
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:37,348
Are you buying?

654
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,819
You'll have to go without me.

655
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,499
Can't they find anybody
else to play with?

656
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:02,673
Why don't you go without me?

657
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:04,539
I like the company.

658
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,109
We'd better move a little faster.

659
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:21,620
<i>Today the capital...</i>

660
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:26,392
<i>... was subjected to a powerful attack</i>
<i>launched by terrorists.</i>

661
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:29,128
<i>They struck with fearsome weapons...</i>

662
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:31,966
<i>... of mass destruction</i>
<i>known as B.O.W.s...</i>

663
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,507
<i>... which have been banned</i>
<i>internationally.</i>

664
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:40,144
We as a country desire nothing more...

665
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:42,374
...than to live in peace.

666
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:46,177
Together with the elders of the
anti-government movement...

667
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:51,189
...who, might I add,
graciously listened to our pleas...

668
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,328
...have managed to avert
the most serious crisis...

669
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,862
...in the history of our nation.

670
01:23:57,165 --> 01:24:02,068
I believe this is undeniable proof
that as a country...

671
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:03,670
...as a people...

672
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:08,832
...we are suitable for full acceptance
into the international community.

673
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,238
As leader...

674
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:16,208
Something wrong?

675
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,179
I don't need this.

676
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:20,253
I'll improvise.

677
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:26,418
What about the elders?

678
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:30,758
It's over. All of them. A little while ago.

679
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:36,198
I suppose I should mention that
during the press conference...

680
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:40,797
...that the terrorists
executed the elders...

681
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:42,465
...as traitors.

682
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,373
Yes, madam.

683
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:47,044
Is there anything else?

684
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:50,077
I've already contacted
the BSAA and Interpol...

685
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,482
...with regard to the damage
we sustained because of Ada Wong.

686
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:57,489
An international warrant for her
arrest will be issued soon.

687
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:00,560
A few of the terrorists
managed to escape the city...

688
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:02,889
...but you don't have to
worry about them.

689
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:04,998
What about the other two?

690
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,661
It's just a matter of time.

691
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:11,830
Finally, there is no one left to stop us.

692
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:14,236
That's right, Madam President.

693
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:17,411
Very well, let's start the
press conference immediately.

694
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:19,740
Yes, of course, Madam President.

695
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:29,580
At last...

696
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,624
...a new tomorrow begins.

697
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,682
They were keeping an eye
on me the whole time.

698
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:10,189
<i>On air in five, four, three...</i>

699
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:13,750
Good evening. I am President...

700
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:15,520
Madam President.

701
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:18,461
We're under attack
by the Americans and Russians.

702
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:21,033
What? It can't be.

703
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,491
Stay down, you dogs.

704
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,031
Stay still.

705
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:55,096
Move. Keep them away.

706
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,033
Move! Move!

707
01:27:57,472 --> 01:28:00,168
- Hands in the air!
- Help me.

708
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,557
So...

709
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:24,295
The Americans and Russians
had us in the palms of their hands...

710
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,092
...from the beginning.

711
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:29,302
That's what it looks like.

712
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:31,867
Did you know about this?

713
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:34,873
No.

714
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:39,173
If I did, I'd still be enjoying
my vacation.

715
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:44,881
Hey.

716
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:12,638
I've lost everything.

717
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:16,513
My mentor...

718
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:18,413
...my friends.

719
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:29,321
I have nothing left to fight for.

720
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,497
Kill me.

721
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,364
Please.

722
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:43,938
I don't want to change
into one of those monsters.

723
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,862
Well...

724
01:30:07,268 --> 01:30:09,759
...I guess there is no other choice.

725
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:31,817
I'd feel the same way if I was you.

726
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:38,763
But the option of taking our own lives
no longer belongs to us.

727
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:47,738
Once we start using these, we owe it
to the people who died alongside us.

728
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:50,002
We have to continue living.

729
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:02,017
Even if it means living the rest of our
lives without the use of our limbs.

730
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,030
That is my answer...

731
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:13,597
...and your answer...

732
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:17,001
...Buddy.

733
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:32,950
<i>It's been three days</i>
<i>since the end of the civil war...</i>

734
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,554
<i>... that tore through</i>
<i>the Eastern Slav Republic.</i>

735
01:31:35,756 --> 01:31:37,189
<i>The fierce battles...</i>

736
01:31:37,358 --> 01:31:41,658
<i>... were halted thanks to the intervention</i>
<i>of American and Russian troops.</i>

737
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,387
<i>Today marks the first day...</i>

738
01:31:43,564 --> 01:31:46,397
<i>... in which the world's media</i>
<i>has access to the city.</i>

739
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:49,559
<i>A temporary government</i>
<i>headed by the U.S. And Russia...</i>

740
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:53,638
<i>... will be set up in the Eastern</i>
<i>Slav Republic to maintain peace.</i>

741
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:57,175
Svetlana Belikova has resigned
from her presidency...

742
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:00,678
<i>... and companies that supported her</i>
<i>and the former government...</i>

743
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:03,681
<i>... will be thrown out of the country</i>
<i>and dismantled.</i>

744
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:08,184
Top brass knew about it right from
the beginning, didn't they?

745
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,924
The report from Scarecrow
tipped them off...

746
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:17,929
...that Svetlana was in
possession of B.O.W.s.

747
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:20,096
That's why they pulled out
in a panic...

748
01:32:20,301 --> 01:32:23,236
...and ran like hell to join forces
with the Russians.

749
01:32:24,338 --> 01:32:26,863
To protect themselves, right?

750
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:28,706
You're mistaken.

751
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:31,367
The president had
nothing to do with this.

752
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:35,539
Not even we knew what was going on.
You have to believe me.

753
01:32:38,452 --> 01:32:39,783
Leon.

754
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:43,219
<i>- Don't...</i>
- I'm not going anywhere.

755
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:50,825
In the end, nothing's really changed.

756
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:12,381
<i>Everything went according to plan.</i>

757
01:33:12,553 --> 01:33:14,544
<i>The facility has been destroyed...</i>

758
01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:17,350
<i>... and I salvaged the cultivated Plaga.</i>

759
01:33:18,459 --> 01:33:21,155
<i>But I haven't decided...</i>

760
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:23,796
<i>... whether or not</i>
<i>I should send it to you.</i>

761
01:33:28,302 --> 01:33:29,633
<i>Really?</i>

762
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:33,103
<i>Thank you. That's very kind.</i>

763
01:33:33,407 --> 01:33:35,967
<i>Although, I sort of liked the idea...</i>

764
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:40,079
<i>... of adding an international</i>
<i>arrest warrant to my profile.</i>

765
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:22,949
What are you doing?

766
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:26,983
- You're going to get in trouble.
- Did you do yours?

767
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:32,999
- Morning.
- Hi.

768
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:35,863
- Good morning.
- Morning.

769
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:52,647
Oh, come on, let's go,
we're gonna be late.

770
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,581
Morning.
