00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,731
The bridge is deserted.

159
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:15,496
- ( Gulls Cawing )
- ( Chuckles )

160
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:33,420
What the hell
happened in here ?

161
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,098
( Switches Clicking )

162
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,380
What a mess.

163
00:19:02,618 --> 00:19:06,110
- ( Switches Clicking )
- Looks like somebody
powered it down, Captain.

164
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,550
Captain ? Captain,
do you see anything ?

165
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:15,961
You'll be the first to know, Woods.

166
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:19,728
- What do you think ? Pirates ?
- Russian Mafia, probably.

167
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,663
Pipe down. Check the radio.

168
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,641
lt's smashed.

169
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:42,853
These logs are worthless,
unless somebody reads Russian.

170
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:47,487
That storm wall is 16 miles due east.
Captain, you've got an hour and a half.

171
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,555
He's, uh, thinking, Foster.

172
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:53,157
You know, something
you were paid to do ?

173
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:58,834
You thinking
what l'm thinking ? Huh ?

174
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,740
- ( Laughing )
- What ?

175
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,870
Salvage ? Salvage, baby.

176
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:08,747
( Chuckling )
You all signed on for a percentage.

177
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:11,980
But you never figured
l'd bring you this, did you ?

178
00:20:12,054 --> 00:20:14,454
A ship abandoned
in international waters.

179
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:17,287
Maritime law says
she's a derelict.

180
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,955
All we have to do is tow her to safety,
slap a salvage lien on her,

181
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,434
and the Russian government has to pay us
10o/o of her value to get her back.

182
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:29,971
Richie, put a number
on her for me.

183
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,734
Well, let's see. There's
three parabolic satellite dishes.

184
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:35,003
One of them's
kind of fucked up.

185
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:40,037
Forty-two labs all primed with,
uh, state-of-the-art stuff.

186
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,675
Let's see. We're talking...

187
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:44,878
two hundred ?

188
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:51,187
- Three hundred million ?
- $300 million.

189
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,458
$300 million !
Ten percent of that is $30 million.

190
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:57,863
That's what's comin' our way.

191
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:00,731
The opportunity of a lifetime
if we play our cards right.

192
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,793
That's what, about 30 grand apiece ?

193
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:06,568
- Three hundred G's apiece.
- Three hundred G's !

194
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,269
That's at one percent ?

195
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:11,244
l'm willing to change all that,

196
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,907
cut you in for ten percent.

197
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,678
That's $3 million each.

198
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:19,016
- ( Richie Chuckles )
- What do you think of that ?

199
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:22,352
What do you think ?

200
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:25,018
- ls it legal ?
- Totally.

201
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:26,958
Totally legal.

202
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:31,932
- Shit. l'm in if you're in, jefe.
- Hey, l'm good.

203
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,663
What about you, Foster ?

204
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:39,639
- Oh, Foster, please ! Come on !
- What ?

205
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:43,542
- Come on ! lt's easy money !
- There's no such thing
as easy money, Squeaky.

206
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:45,705
l'll take that as a yes, Foster.

207
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:48,443
Baker, find the ship's generator.
We need power to the bridge.

208
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:52,044
See if you can get
the main engines running.
Squeaky, you go with him. Richie ?

209
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,816
Throw a line down to the tug.
We're gonna have to turn
this ship into the wind.

210
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,654
Foster, can you see if you can get some
of this navigational equipment started ?

211
00:21:57,726 --> 00:22:00,058
Captain. My father was an admiral.

212
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:02,494
l know a little something
about maritime law.

213
00:22:02,564 --> 00:22:04,657
lf there's anybody alive on this ship,
you can't claim her.

214
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:07,964
- Then let's not find anyone alive.
- What does that mean ?

215
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:13,004
Just that. l hope
we don't find anyone alive.

216
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:16,506
Woods, come back to me.

217
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:20,344
We're gonna need to turn
the ship into the wind.

218
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:28,050
lt just doesn't add up. You know ?

219
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:32,822
Russian vessel, middle of nowhere,
dead in the water, crew vanished ?

220
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:36,762
- l mean, why would they abandon ship ?
- l don't know.

221
00:22:36,832 --> 00:22:39,130
And another thing. Who the hell
do you think we can trust here ?

222
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:41,431
We're talkin' about an awful lot
of goddamn money, right ?

223
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:45,769
Listen, the only two guys
that we can trust is just
you and me, Stevie. That's it.

224
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:48,366
l wouldn't take a check
from the captain.

225

you couldn't pull a pin
out of his ass with a tractor.

what the hell Hiko is.

228

Richie's crazy like a fox, Stevie.

229
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,621
But, you know, l think
he just might be there for us.

230
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:14,661
And Foster's good.

231
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:17,671
''Good'' ?

232
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:20,139
What do you mean by ''good'' ?

233
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,768
l mean she's solid, on the level.

234

What'd you think l meant ?

235
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,343

236
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,976
( Chuckling )
Course l think she's hot. Don't you ?

237
00:23:36,358 --> 00:23:38,349
- Right here, Steve. Right here.

371
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:54,604

of ejection seat or escape vehicle.

372
00:33:56,778 --> 00:34:00,270

Uh, three million ?
Probably open a school.

Oh, yeah ?
Does it have a beach ?

389

Beautiful white sand.
Hammock, sailboat.

390
00:35:04,612 --> 00:35:07,103

402
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:13,113
Come on.

403
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:17,208

Hey, watch out ! Watch out, watch out !
Thermite grenades.

409
00:36:36,104 --> 00:36:39,631
One of those things blows, burn a hole
right through the deck. Be careful.

410
00:36:39,707 --> 00:36:43,507
- Be careful, really careful.
- What's she trying to do ?
Sink the ship ?

00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:03,264
l told you.
Dead or deserted.

463
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:06,169
Three hundred crew members are gone ?

464
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,969
What happened ?

465
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:12,910
Eight days ago, during a transmission
from the MlR space station,

466
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:15,447
something came onto the ship.

467
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:19,246
We thought our transmitters
and receivers were malfunctioning,
so we shut them down.

468
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:24,154
( Panting ) lt took control
of computers, scanned all information.

469
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:28,251
Language, encyclopedias,
medical data. lt was learning.

470
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:31,058
Learning what ?

471
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:33,065
( Whispering )
How to kill us.

472
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:39,165
My captain, Alexi, and me
were the last to survive.

473
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,401
We cut their cables,
smashed them--

474
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:44,603
Wait a minute.
You just said ''them.''

475
00:41:44,678 --> 00:41:48,739
Before you said ''it.''
Who's ''them'' ?

476
00:41:48,815 --> 00:41:52,307
Mm. Machine.
Uh, machines.

477
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:56,583
Machines. Ah.

478
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:01,360
- l'm telling you the truth.
- l-l know. l--

479
00:42:01,428 --> 00:42:03,521
- ( Captain ) Foster ?
- Yeah, l'm in here.

480
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:10,568
lt's okay. Nobody's going to hurt you.
lt's okay. lt's okay.

481
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,974
She's nuts.

482
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:18,203
But something scared
the hell out of her.

483
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:22,674
l say we get her
up to the bridge. Hiko.

484
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,410
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me the flashlight.

485
00:42:24,484 --> 00:42:27,180
You're gonna be okay. lt's okay.
We're gonna get you something to eat.

486
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:31,088
Come on. Come on.
Watch your head. lt's okay.

487
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,294
- Are you okay ?
- Yes.

488
00:42:35,362 --> 00:42:37,660
- Go !
- No ! ( Grunts )

489
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:42,358
- You got her ? Okay, go.
- l'm not a threat !

490
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,764
l'm not a threat !

491
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:50,772

you know, with my dad.

492

494
00:42:56,082 --> 00:42:59,017
( Woods ) lt sounds like
somebody's working down there.

495
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,054
What-- uh--

496
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,350
Hey ! Anybody in here ?

497
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:11,659
( Woods )
Shh ! Quiet, man. Be quiet.

498
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:15,961
Stay down.
There might be somebody.

499

- ( Chittering )

another one of those things, man.

- l'm outta here.

503

( Chittering )

504
00:43:43,697 --> 00:43:45,631
Richie, Woods,
where the hell are you two ?

505
00:43:45,699 --> 00:43:50,568
Hey, Steve, listen. There's
a machine shop down here with, uh,

506
00:43:50,637 --> 00:43:55,233
- state-of-the-art robotics.
- l already told you twice
to get your asses to the engine room !

507
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:59,540
- You hear me ?
- Yeah, yeah.

508
00:43:59,613 --> 00:44:01,547

00:44:25,605 --> 00:44:27,596
Come on, Woodsy.

511

l'm not--
l'm not comin'.

Hey, little buddy.

513
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,874
- Richie, let's go.
- Hey, hey, Woodsy.
Did the other one bother you ?

514
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,009
Huh ? No, it didn't.

515
00:45:20,627 --> 00:45:23,653
Richie.

516
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,891
Richie ?

517
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,125

00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:34,570
Goddamn, Richie !

520
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:36,836
( Screams )

521
00:45:53,973 --> 00:45:55,804
l'm sick of this !

522
00:46:00,913 --> 00:46:04,576
- Oh, God.
- Steve, this is Richie.
There's another Russian down here.

523
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,619
The son of a bitch shot at us !
And Woods is hurt.

524
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:09,881
- So watch your ass. You copy ?
- Copy that. How is he ?

525
00:46:09,955 --> 00:46:13,584
- ( Panting )
- Just tell him it's bad. Ow !

526
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:16,890
- Bad !
- He'll live,
but he ain't in a good mood, man.

527
00:46:16,962 --> 00:46:20,329
Just get him to the damn engine room.
And no more sightseeing, all right ?

528
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:22,697
Yeah. Copy, copy, copy.
All right.

529
00:46:22,768 --> 00:46:25,328
- ( Groans )
- Get up. Get up.

530
00:46:31,944 --> 00:46:35,243
Squeaky ? Squeak ?

531
00:46:37,149 --> 00:46:41,643
Holy shit. What the hell ?

532
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,881
Oh, my God.

533
00:46:43,956 --> 00:46:46,823
Jesus Christ ! Squeak ?

534
00:46:48,027 --> 00:46:51,622
( Pounding On Door )
Squeak ? Open up !

535
00:46:51,697 --> 00:46:53,824
( Grunts, Yelps )

536
00:46:53,899 --> 00:46:57,027
- Don't shoot ! lt's us !
- Where the hell have you two been ?

537
00:46:57,102 --> 00:46:59,036
Back from your holiday ?

538
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:05,576
- Jesus Christ. Woods, you're a mess.
- Thank you.

539
00:47:05,644 --> 00:47:10,013
-You said a Russian did this ?
-No, a machine did that with a nail gun.

540
00:47:10,082 --> 00:47:13,108
Yeah, that's right. You're not
gonna believe it till you see it.

541
00:47:13,185 --> 00:47:15,517
There's some really weird shit
goin' down on this ship, man.

542
00:47:15,588 --> 00:47:18,489
- Weird ain't the word.
- l'm in need of some
proper medical attention.

543
00:47:18,557 --> 00:47:21,890
- Shut the fuck up !
- l don't belong on this ship.

544
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:24,623
- Somebody just welded
the engine room door shut.
- lt's welded ?

545
00:47:24,697 --> 00:47:27,222
- Squeaky's still missing.
- Weird.

546
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:29,790
( Sniffing )
R-Richie ?

547
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:34,306
( Sniffing )
Richie, it's that smell again.

548
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:42,071
- Squeak ?
- Hey, Squeaky !

549
00:47:42,147 --> 00:47:44,911
- ( Speaking Russian )
- Squeak, man.
- ls that you ?

550
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:48,312
Shit !

551
00:47:54,894 --> 00:47:58,557
- Go !
- That bastard shot at us !

552
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:09,700
You're all going to die.

553
00:48:09,775 --> 00:48:11,936
You hear that, Foster ?

554
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:15,845
We're all going to die,
because there are aliens on this ship.

555
00:48:15,915 --> 00:48:18,543
( Chuckles )
That's all the grounds l need.

556
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:24,919
One of my men is missing.
And l want some answers !

557
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:28,050
And no more
of this Twilight Zone stuff.

558
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:31,988
l don't know anything
about your man.

559
00:48:32,064 --> 00:48:36,467
Rubbish.
l'm gonna give you five seconds,

560
00:48:36,535 --> 00:48:38,469
and then l'm gonna
blow your brains out.

561
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:41,938
- One--
- She couldn't possibly know
where Squeaky is.

562
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:47,240
- She was hiding in sick bay.
- She knows. She dropped
an anchor on my tug.

563
00:48:47,313 --> 00:48:49,247
She fired at us. Two.

564
00:48:49,315 --> 00:48:51,545
Captain !
Hiko, come on !

565
00:48:51,617 --> 00:48:55,053
- That anchor nearly killed me.
l'm not feeling too sympathetic.
- Me neither.

566
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,489
- Three.
- Shoot me. l don't care.
Just shut down the power to the ship.

567
00:49:01,527 --> 00:49:04,087
( Gun Cocks )

568
00:49:04,163 --> 00:49:07,064
Captain, she's not gonna
tell you what you wanna hear.

569
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,828
Hey, Captain. l'd like to hear
what she has to say about this.

570
00:49:10,903 --> 00:49:13,633
Up here on the chart table, Richie.

571
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:17,733
Fake bastard !

572
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:20,745
What the bloody hell is that ?

573
00:49:20,813 --> 00:49:23,043
lt beats the hell out of us.

574
00:49:24,116 --> 00:49:26,141
lt's Alexi, my captain.

575
00:49:26,218 --> 00:49:29,654
Hell, whatever it is,
it tried to kill us.

576
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:37,224
Squeaky's still AWOL, and somebody
welded the engine room door shut.

577
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:39,764
We're not alone here.

578
00:49:39,832 --> 00:49:41,766
She's got another friend down there.

579
00:49:41,834 --> 00:49:43,927
Can someone explain
what the hell is goin' on ?

580
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:49,603
Finish your story, Nadia.

581
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:54,604
The energy that came
from the MlR...

582
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,616
infested all of the ship's
electrical systems.

583
00:49:58,684 --> 00:50:01,744
Mainframe computer,
the labs, the machine shops.

584
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,551
lt activated fire extinguishers.

585
00:50:05,624 --> 00:50:07,956
Sixty-seven died
from halon gas poisoning.

586
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:10,291
Quarter of the crew.

587
00:50:10,362 --> 00:50:15,265
lt cut us off from machine shops
and started building.

588
00:50:15,334 --> 00:50:18,497
The little ones first--
the gatherers.

589
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,505
Yeah. We saw a whole room full of them.
That's what nailed Woods.

590
00:50:23,676 --> 00:50:26,907
Then came something...
more dangerous.

591
00:50:28,347 --> 00:50:31,612
Half man, half machine.

592
00:50:31,684 --> 00:50:35,142
A biomechanism. Engineering
beyond our comprehensions.

593
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:40,453
The rest of the crew deserted,
taking their chances in the sea.

594
00:50:40,526 --> 00:50:43,962
Only Alexi and me stayed,
cutting cables.

595
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:46,759
What does cutting cables
have to do with it ?

596
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:52,826
The machines are controlled by
the electrical energy in the computer.

597
00:50:52,905 --> 00:50:56,636
lf we can cut their source
of power, they'll die.

598
00:50:56,709 --> 00:51:00,145
We cut these to get him here.
What the hell are you talking about ?

599
00:51:00,212 --> 00:51:04,273
What is this thing that's
inside the computer, huh ?

600
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:07,113
lt's a life-form
unlike anything we know.

601
00:51:07,186 --> 00:51:10,553
Not cellular but electrical in nature.
Extremely intelligent.

602
00:51:10,622 --> 00:51:12,783
You mean it's like
lightning that can think.

603
00:51:12,858 --> 00:51:15,622
lt has no form, no shape,
but it's giving itself what it lacks.

604
00:51:17,029 --> 00:51:18,963
lt's creating
a new life-form...

605
00:51:19,031 --> 00:51:21,056
using parts of the ship and crew.

606
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:25,931
Blood is still pumping
through this brain.

607
00:51:26,004 --> 00:51:27,938
There's been
no decomposition at all.

608
00:51:32,111 --> 00:51:35,444
Yeah. Here, right here.
See ? There's...

609
00:51:35,514 --> 00:51:39,314
some kind of coil or self-contained
power supply built right into it.

610
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:41,477
Amazing.

611
00:51:41,553 --> 00:51:45,216
- This brain is still alive.
