So what did you find out ?

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,154
His name's Thomas Aquinas.
He's a priest.

Why don't you tell us
something we don't know ?

having a spiritual crisis.

Oh, yeah.

I've already told the police. Thomas
was a friend of mine and a colleague.

298
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,593
He had nothing to do
with what happened today.

There was no one else
on that fire escape.

- I understand getting shot at,
and I don't like it.

301
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,233
- He shot at you ?
- No, he shot at my client.

302
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,397
- I happened to get in the way.
- Who's your client ?

303
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,433
That's irrelevant right now.
What I want to know is why would
a priest try to kill someone ?

304
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,678
You've been drinking. I've got
1 4 years sober, and I can spot that.

305
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,554
Well, good foryou. Your friend and
colleague, was he working for someone ?

306
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,557
Yes, he was working for God.

307
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,240
So God ordered a hit
on an investment banker ?

308
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,079
There's a lot that you don't know.

309
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,236
You haven't. There are
things you never dreamed of.

310
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,114
There's another world out there.
Thomas saw it, and it destroyed him.

311
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,153
I've seen a lot too, but there's nothing
that would make me cut my tongue out.

312
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,795
- Yeah, well, wait a few days.
- What happens in a few days ?

313
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,195
Did Thomas tellyou
about agirl?

314
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,398
- No.
- I see. Do you believe in God ?

315
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,197
Maybe once, but not any more.

316
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,311
What happened ?

317
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,795
We had a difference ofopinion.

318
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,118
I thought that my wife and daughter
should live, and He felt otherwise.

319
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,438
I'm sorry to hear about the loss. Maybe
it's time foryou to renew your faith.

This girl.

321
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,430
Is she in trouble ?
Does she need help ?

322
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,358
- I have a lot ofthings to do here.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

323
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,199
- I have more questions,
ifyou don't mind.
- I've got a question foryou.

324
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,993
Ifyou don't believe in God,
how can you understand his adversary ?

325
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,318
Now I have to believe in God
in order to solve a crime ?

326
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,398
I'm sure that you
can find your way out.

That would help.

00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,032
Maybe we do.
Maybe it's not "Christ in New York."

00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,949
Take it easy.
We're the good guys.

461
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,435
Allright ?
What happened?

462
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,913
Carson. Those men--
Th-Those men--

463
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,190
They tried to kill me.
* Panting *

464
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,595
Why ?
* Panting *

465
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,349
Eightjets, variablespeed.
That's what lcalldyingin style.

466
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,436
What kind of girl lives
in a house like this, anyway ?

467
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,471
Oh, she's an orphan.
Both parents deceased.

468
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,398
After the mother died,
the home nurse married the father.

469
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,476
Now the nurse
is the sole guardian.

470
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,114
I think it's adorable
the way you talk like a real cop.

471
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,754
Yeah ? So you think after
they clean up this mess, we could...

472
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,996
- * Marge * Don't tempt me.
- soaka little ?

473
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,356
- They relax me. You want one ?
- Oh, no, thanks. I drink.

474
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,878
- My little girl had onejust like it.
- Really ?

475
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,913
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah ? You snoop through
her stuffwithout asking too ?

476
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,110
When I was looking
for something.

477
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,629
What are you looking for ?

478
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,557
A connection.

479
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,592
Most days, I don't feel
connected to anyone.

480
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,837
I noticed a lot
of religious books outside.

481
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,951
Mm. They're
my stepmother's.

482
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,719
- Is she a big believer ?
- No, not really.

483
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,195
It's mostlyjust kind of
like a hobby with her.

484
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,392
Do you know a priest
by the name ofThomas Aquinas ?

485
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,193
No. Is that
your connection, religion ?

486
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,151
I've seen a lot
ofattempted murders,

487
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,748
but I've never seen anyone
perform the last rites before.

488
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,552
- *Mabel* Christine ?
- In here !

489
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,517
Are you all right ? Oh, my God,
I just heard what happened !

490
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,437
Did they hurt you ?

491
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,516
I'm okay, but Carson--

492
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,154
I know. Oh.

493
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,234
I'm just so glad
you came along when you did.

494
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,237
Thanks.

495
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,510
* Sighs *

496
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,349
I didn't realize you knew where
the library was, let alone had a card.

497
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,916
Well, there's a lot
about me you don't know.

498
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,558
*Mabel*
They're right outside.

499
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,114
*DrAbelOn Telephone* You must
bringher. He is waitingforher.

500
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,152
No, that's impossible !
They'll follow me and find the temple !

501
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,877
I couldn't convince her
to come here.

502
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,039
Yuck ! Then I shall
have to go to her.

503
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,116
Didlmention
lhada date tonight ?

504
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,310
Notjust the inflatable kind.
A real live girl.

505
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,476
Did you break up
with the inflatable one ?

506
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,388
Yeah. She was
just too needy.

507
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,954
Everything
was about her.

508
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,594
It'sjust that this is starting
to feel a lot like work.

509
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,269
Normally, l wouldn't mind work
because, well,you know,

510
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,311
we'dbegettingpaid.

511
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,318
Watching rich people for free.
Itjust seems odd, doesn't it ?

512
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,830
Okay, I'll wait here.

513
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,479
- Change your mind about the pill ?
- I found something.

514
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,117
Christine, what are you doing ?
Why is that man here ?

515
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,037
I'll be five minutes.

516
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,436
She lovesme to death,
butshe'sa little overprotective.

517
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,989
I took this from one
ofyour attackers.

518
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,509
- Did you show that to the police ?
- No.

519
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,394
If I did, it would end up in a plastic
envelope on one oftheir large shelves.

520
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,229
- That's pretty cynical.
- Well, I've put
a few ofthose envelopes...

521
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,669
up on that
large shelf myself.

522
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,394
I used to be a cop.

523
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,715

is from a Masonic order...

527
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,556
So, the men that attacked me
are devil worshippers ?

528
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,717
No. This says
they're the good guys.

529
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,752
They're the ones that are supposed
to stop the devil worshippers.

530
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,952
Those were the good guys ?
What does that have to do with me ?

but I've never
shared one before.

539
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,157
There must be
an explanation.

540
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,510
I hope so. I've been waiting
all my life to hear it.

I'm gonna want him to.

almost killed her !
- Vatican knights ?

610
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,117
Oh, my God.

611
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,118
Well, they're not my people.
They think they're doing God's work.

612
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,231
- But they're not.
- I want to know what's going on,

613
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,635
- and I want to know right now !
- Put the gun away.

614
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,354
Did anybody
see you come ?

615
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,950
- No.
- Good. We should be safe here.

616
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:54,313
According to the Scriptures,
he can't see inside ofthe house of God.

617
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,954
- Who can't ?
- Maybe now you're ready to believe.

618
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,911
- *Woman ChantinglnAncient Language*
- * Computer Beeping *

619
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,276
* Chanting Continues *

620
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,439
- Her hands are healed.
- That's the power offaith.

621
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,710
- Who is she ?
- She's a Polish peasant.

622
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,796
She fellinto a trance
about two weeksago,

623
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,798
and then she began to speak
in a language she couldn't
possibly have known.

624
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,311
- She made aprophecyabout EndofDays.
- "End of Days" ?

625
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,318
Of man's destruction and
the unholy's reign upon the earth.

626
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,557
Why don't you stop all this church talk
and tell us what the hell is going on.

627
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,356
- Who's after her ?
- Well, ifyou'll excuse me,
I'll try to explain.

628
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,040
*Kovak* You knowanything
about the numberofthe beast ?

629
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,799
Revelation ofSt.John ?
From his dream ?

630
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,674
- Six-six-six ?
- The number ofthe beast
is not six-six-six.

631
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,873
Often in dreams, numbers appear
upside down and backwards.

632
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,039
So, six-six-six
becomes nine-nine-nine.

633
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,879
Like in 1 999,
the year of his return.

634
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,070
What does that
have to do with me ?

635
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,557
Regressus diaboli:
The return ofSatan.

636
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,638
Does any ofthis
look familiar to you ?

637
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,471
She's been chosen.
He's in her blood.

638
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,479
The Holy Church hasbeen searching
foryousince the dayyou were born.

639
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,478
- Chosen for what ?
- Everythousandyears,
on the eve ofthe millennium,

640
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,591
the Dark Angel comes
and takes a body,

641
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,872
and then he walks the Earth, looking
for a woman who will bear his child.

642
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,629
lt allhas to happen in that unholyhour
before midnight on New Year'sEve.

643
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,275
lfhe consummatesyourflesh
with thishuman body,

644
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,994
then he unlocks
the gate of hell...

645
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,829
andeverythingas we knowit
ceases to exist.

646
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,838
So, the Prince ofDarkness
wants to conquerthe Earth,

647
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,918
but has to wait untilan hour
before midnight ofNew Year'sEve ?

648
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,271
- Is this Eastern time ?
- It's got nothing to do
with New Year's Eve.

649
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,198
It has to do with
a temporary celestial alignment.

650
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:08,039
The Gregorian monks
studiedthe heavens.

651
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,754
They were able to calculate
the precise moment ofthis event.

652
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,474
Theycreatedourcalendar
bymapping this event...

653
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,034
andcountingbackwards
from that moment.

654
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,755
- It was a mistake to come here.
- It doesn't matter
whetheryou believe or not.

655
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,838
He's real, and he won't rest
till he finds this girl.

656
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,509
- Why did he pick me ?
- Because the stars were
right when you were born.

657
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,837
A man'sbody wasalso chosen,
just likeyours.

658
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,191
lfthe devildoes exist,
whydoesn'tyourgoddo anything ?

659
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:38,348
It's not my God. It's our God,
and He doesn't say that He will save us.

660
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,472
He says that
we will save ourselves.

661
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,672
Save myself? What am lsupposedto do ?
Get a restraining order?

662
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,872
- We have to have faith.
- Faith.

663
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,355
Yes, faith.
lt'san interesting concept.

664
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,472
Ifyou read the Bible,
you can't miss it. Faith !

665
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:59,232
Between your faith
and my Glock nine millimetre,
I take my Glock. Come on. Let's go.

666
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,830
I'm afraid it takes a person
of pure heart to defeat pure evil.

667
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,633
You did yourjob. You brought her here
to people offaith. We'll protect her.

668
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,753
- We'll hide her.
- You know, you live
in a different world.

669
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,316
We have some real serious problems here,
and this is not solving them.

670
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,432
Satan's greatest trick
was convincing man he didn't exist.

671
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,915
I don't, uh--
This all feels true to me.

672
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:30,194
You'll be safer with me. At least I can
fight this guy with something real.

673
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,675
You know what to do.
You feelit.

674
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,550
* Softly *
I'm sorry.

675
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,477
Let him go.

676
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,031
* Priest Speaking
In Italian *

677
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,274
It gets easier when you
accept what you are.

678
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,279
A fallen soul.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

679
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,470
* Chuckling *

680
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,711

- * Whispers * How did I get in here ?
- Who the fuck are you ?

682
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,475
Oh, I think
you know who I am.

683
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,989
You just don't
want to believe it.

684
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,875
I took a bullet foryou.

685
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,195
- I protected you.
- Oh, no-no-no. You didn't protect me.

686
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:46,393
You protected this body.
Am I-- Am I getting a pattern here ?

687
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:51,719
So much pain.
"Not to be taken with alcohol."

688
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,308
Remember that.

689
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,271
Oh.

690
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,914
To lose a wife andchild.

691
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,477
I can't even imagine
what that must be like.

692
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:08,071
- What do you want ?
- To make you happy again.

707
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,119
- He never comes home.
- Well, honey,you know
yourdaddy workshard.

708
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:04,312
It's not about how much time you're
there. It's about "quality time."

709
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,910
Now, he'll be homejust like
he promised. You'll see.

710
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,837
He keepshispromises.

711
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,669
I can give it all back to you.
Everything that He took away.

712
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,392
Everything.

713
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,273
You can hold
your wife again.

714
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,915
You can watch your daughter walk
through the door in her prom dress.

715
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,838
All you have to do is tell me
where the girl is.

716
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,475
Come on. She's a nobody to you.
You don't even know her.

717
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,909
You're in the middle ofsomething
you don't really understand.

718
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,112
You thinkyou're saving her from me ?
She wants to be with me.

719
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,959
- You knowthat.
- What did you do in school today ?

- You toldmeyou'ddo anything
togetyourfamilyback.

722
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,476
You want them ?
This is your chance.

723
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,672
- They're not real.
- Does that matter?

724
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,314
- Oh, yes.
- lthinkyou needto be reminded...

725
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,874
of how painful
reality is.

726
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,710

Oh, it's true.

01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,679
It wasn't your fault.

738
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,155
- I wasn't there.
- No, you werejust--

739
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,111
You were out doing yourjob.

740
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:09,756
- I wasn't fucking there !
- Oh, look at you. Torn apart by guilt.

741
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,714
You didn't do anything wrong. You were
an honest cop. You didn't take money.

742
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,991
You had to testify against them even
after they threatened your family.

743
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,031
Most people would never
testify against those guys.

744
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,196
They're not like you.
You had to do the right thing.

745
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,550
And where was God, hmm ?

746
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:26,478
He could've stopped it, but he didn't.
He fucked you.
Then He made you feel guilty.

747
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,478
Me, I don't do guilt.
I didn't do what happened here.

748
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,672
He did.
Now you just think about that.

749
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,597
Then you tell me
who's really your friend.

750
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,075
I can make it like
it never happened.

You will never see the girl !

754
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:50,037
Now, you see--
Now you're upsetting me.

755
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,720
You don't want to see me upset,
believe me.

756
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,912
Oh, you want to fuck with me ?
You thinkyou know bad, huh ?

757
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,555
You're a fucking choirboy
compared to me ! A choirboy !

758
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,433
You're in touch with your anger.
I really like that.

759
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,313
I don't know about you,
but I'm going to have a drink.

760
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,273
You and I are so much alike.

761
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,039
We're nothing alike !
Nothing !

762
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,550
Look at yourself. Look at this.
Look at what you are now.

763
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,797
You walked away from the light,
just like me. You want one ?

764
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,072
- You need to get out, now.
- Come on. You know
what's in your heart.

765
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,476
- We're on thesameside.
- I'm not on your side,
and I never will be.

766
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,434
* Laughs * You're on His side ?
He's the one who took away your family.

767
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,471
Let me tell you
something about Him.

768
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,672
He is the biggest underachiever
ofall time.

769
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,271
Hejust had a good publicist,
that's all. Something good happens:
"It's His will."

770
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,437
Something bad happens:
"He moves in mysterious ways."

771
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,358
You take that-- that overblown
press kit they call the Bible.

772
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,357
You lookforthe answerin there,
what do theytellyou ?

773
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,916
"Shit happens."
* Scoffs * Please.

774
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,749
He treated you like garbage.
You walked away.

775
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,952
I'm not the bad guy.

776
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,150
What about the End of Days ?

777
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,430
Think of it
as a new beginning.

778
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,950
A change of management. And you'll be
right there with me on the ground floor.

779
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,152
It will be so cool.

780
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,077
Tell me what you want.

781
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,998
Tell me what you really want,
and I'll give it to you.

782
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,354
I'll tell you what I want.

783
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,397
I want you to go to hell.

784
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,638
* Sighs * You see,
sometimes the problem is...

785
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,591
* Neck Bones Cracking *

786
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,075

- Don't fuck up the coat.
- * Groans *

789
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,476
I've wasted
too much time on this.

790
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,910
You see those insignificant little dots
down there ? Huh ? Do you see them ?

791
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,350
That's what you mean to me.
Now, give me the girl !

792
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,436
* Gasps *
Not today.

793
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,040
* Groans *

794
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,029
Look down.

795
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:36,676
Now, look in your heart
and tell me you don't want to die.

796
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,597
All you got to do
is take my hand.

797
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,632
- * Grunting *
- And I'll give you back
everything that He took away.

799
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,874
- Come on.
- Okay.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

801

01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,671
Hey.
Hey !

810
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,590
- I thought you were dead.
- Couple ofseconds, I would've been.

811
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,917
All I remember is steppin' out
ofthe van, then I woke up
in the fucking gutter.

812
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,713
- What the hell are you doing here ?
- What are you talking about ?

813
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,957
l've been lookin'foryou allnight.

814
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,629
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- I can't trust you.

815
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:12,309
I don't know how much
you had to drink, okay,
but let's not point the gun at me ?

816
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,431
- I just need to know.
- You need to know what ?

817
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,030
- That you are you.
- Ofcourse I'm me !
What the hell are you talking about ?

818
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,399
- You took his body.
- All right. You're ill.

819
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,159
Okay ? You need some help.
All right ?

820
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,669
Oh, fuck !
Jesus !

821
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,916
- Fuck.
- You're bleeding.

822
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,270
Ofcourse I'm bleeding !
You fuckin' shot me !

823
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,517
- I just needed to find out !
- You found out, okay ?

824
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,950
- Stop being such a pussy !
It'sjust a scratch.
- Pussy ? Come on !

825
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,435
- Oh, Christ.
- Does it hurt ?

826
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,790
What do you think ?
Jesus.

827
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,388
What the hell's the matter with you ?
What's going on here ?

828
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,351
I can't explain it.

829
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,558
I shouldn't have left
her alone like that.

830
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:59,150
- I should be with her.
- *Bobby* Tellme what to do.

831
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,316
I gotta get back there.
* Panting *

832
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,670
Got to get her
as far away from him as I can.

833
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,473
Okay, we'll leave town.
You get her. I'll get a Striker car.

834
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,477
Just tell me
where to meet you.

835
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,838
St.John's Church...
in one hour.

836
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,834
Howmuch longer, Father?

837
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,999
Well, he has to sire his child between
1 1 :00 and midnight tomorrow night.

838
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,556
- So, we must keep you hidden
until that hour passes.
- *Banging*

839
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,836
- We've come to help.
- Your Eminence.

840
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,191
In this hour ofdarkness,
we need all the help we can get.

841
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,912
- How's the girl ?
- The girl's fine. Thanks.

842
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,156
No.

843
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,238
No. Father ! Father, they're
the ones who tried to kill me !

844
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,590
*Groaning*

845
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,676
- No !
- YourEminence, what areyou doing ?

846
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,756
- We cannot allow
this union to takeplace.
- No ! No.

847
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,233
- Please !
- You can't! You mustn't!

848
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,033
- *Christine* Letgo !
- She is only one life.

849

Howmanylivesareyouprepared
to endifwe do nothing ?

850
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,357
- That's not who we are.
- Ofcourse it is.

851
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,597
We are doing God's work.
We are preventing the End of Days.

852
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:22,076
But you can't prevent evil
by doing evil.

853
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,031
- There is no time !
- No !
- * Chanting *

854
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,071
- It's the only way.
- No-o-o !

- * Groaning *
- Now, let her go.

859
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,111
You must let us finish.

860
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,710
lfshe isslain, hishope ofcreating
a kingdom on Earth dies with her.

861
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,513
- Herdeath is God's will.
- It's not God's will.

862
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,631
- lt'syour will, andit will
leadto ourdestruction.
-Jericho.

863
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,149
She must be removed.
lt's the only wayto defeat him.

864
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,397
For a thousand years,
we prepared ourselves for this.

865
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,193
- We're not afraid to die.
- Good.

866
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,276
Because I'm not afraid
to kill you.

867
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,550
Let her go.

868

*Rumbling*

01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,191

*Kovak*
Go !

871
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,032
God help us.
We're too late.

872
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,755
- I've come for my wife.
- Let's go.

873
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,348
Thisis the house ofthe Lord,
ourGod, andyou are not welcome here.

874
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,836
I can stand the pain of being in church.
How much pain can you bear ?

875
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,599
Christine !
Come to me.

876

lam the one
you've been waitingfor.

877
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,236
I am the answer
to your prayers.

878
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:01,158
In the name of God,
I orderyou to leave here now !

bear witness to the End of Days.
