1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,640
Turn him over.

2
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
Oh, no!

3
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
"Do not drink wine nor strong drink...

4
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,200
"...thou, nor thy sons with thee...

5
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:08,999
"...lest ye shall die.

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
"Look not thou upon the wine
when it is red...

7
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,800
"...and when it bringeth his color
in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

8
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:19,520
"At the last it biteth like a serpent...

9
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
"...and stingeth like an adder."

10
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,200
Now, folks...

11
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,400
...that's from the Good Book...

12
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,199
...but in this town...

13
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,360
...it's five cents a glass.

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
Five cents a glass.

15
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,880
Does anyone really think
that is the price of a drink?

16
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
The price of a drink? Let him decide...

17
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,799
...who has lost his courage and pride...

18
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,160
...who lies a groveling
heap of clay not far removed...

19
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,360
All's quiet, sir.

20
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,640
Let's fall in.

21
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,680
Follow me.

22
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,400
I beg your pardon.

23
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
- I'm so sorry.
- Allow me, ma'am.

24
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:27,660
Thank you.

25
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:28,920
May I?

26
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,880
Thank you.

27
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,200
Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!

28
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,680
Look.

29
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,020
I don't care what you meant to do...

30
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:56,440
...it's what you did I don't like.

31
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,200
You inconvenienced this lady,
and made a fool of yourself...

32
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:06,120
...and this railroad.

33
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,280
Now, I want you to apologize to this...

34
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,480
Yes, can I help you?

35
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,840
If they move, kill them.

36
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,120
Is he with them?

37
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
He's there.

38
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
Hold your fire! Get down!

39
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,440
Wait till they come out.

40
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,080
I can nail him.

41
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,800
I said, wait!

42
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,399
What if they go out the back?

43
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,320
It's covered.
You two-bit redneck peckerwood.

44
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,240
Abe?

45
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,760
I solemnly promise...

46
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,639
...God helping me...

47
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,360
"I solemnly promise, God helping me..."

48
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,720
...to abstain from all distilled,
fermented malt liquors...

49
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,239
...including wine, beer and cider...

50
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,440
"...to abstain from liquor,
wine, cider and beer."

51
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,360
People marching down the street.
They'll pass by the horses.

52
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,239
We'll join them.

53
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,160
The Temperance Union?

54
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,240
They should have been told.

55
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:05,439
Told what?

56
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,000
How long can anybody in this manure pile
keep his mouth shut?

57
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,800
"Yes, we'll gather at the river

58
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,000
"The beautiful, beautiful river

59
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,480
"Gather with the saints at the river"

60
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,800
Rifles.

61
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,880
One?

62
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,920
No, three!

63
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,960
Maybe more, there, on the roof.

64
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,039
Get down.

65
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,720
Son of a bitch!

66
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,839
Bounty hunters?

67
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,640
Hell, I wouldn't know.

68
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,320
Buck, with Abe.

69
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,760
I kill them now?

70
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,280
Hold them here as long as you can.

71
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,320
I'll hold them till hell freezes over
or you say different.

72
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,160
When I kick him out, blast him.

73
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,800
We'll run for it.

74
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,360
Give me that shotgun.

75
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,000
"The beautiful, beautiful river

76
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,200
"Gather with the saints at the river

77
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,720
"That flows by the throne of God"

78
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,040
Set?

79
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
Let's go!

80
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,520
Good luck, boys!

81
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,240
They're blowing this town to hell!

82
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
You're trash!

83
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Now, you just hush now.

84
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
They was playing Gather at the River.

85
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,400
You know that one?

86
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,400
Sing it!

87
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,080
"Shall we gather at the river

88
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,960
"Where bright angel feet have trod"

89
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,999
Hurry!

90
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,720
"River that flows by the throne of God"

91
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,200
Come on, you lazy bastard!

92
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm coming!

93
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,840
They've cleared out, for Christ's sake!

94
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,920
Let's go, T.C.!

95
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,880
Put some more on!

96
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,560
Let's go!

97
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,080
Take him!

98
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,480
He's mine!

99
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,680
He's mine!

100
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,599
I shot this one!
Look at the size of that hole!

101
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
You just dig out that bullet
and see if it ain't my.06!

102
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:52,799
You know I shot him.

103
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,560
You'd claim the whole thing, wouldn't you?

104
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,640
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Did he have any money?

105
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,120
Damn, I can't get his belt off!

106
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
You stupid, damn fools!

107
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,000
Why did you shoot this employee
and let the others get away?

108
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:15,000
I didn't! My first shot
killed this man right here!

109
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,280
Liar!

110
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,720
He shot that employee while I dropped
this bandit and them others too.

111
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,740
I must've killed all three of them.

112
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:25,880
What were we doing up on that roof?

113
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,199
Liar!

114
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,399
Black liar!

115
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,560
Don't talk like that to me.

116
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,080
I'm sorry.

117
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,560
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.

118
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,000
I think this will do pretty good.

119
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,840
Next time, plan the massacre carefully,
or I'll start with you.

120
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,480
Why didn't you kill Pike
when you had the chance?

121
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,280
Stop!

122
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,000
Feathers flew like a turkey!

123
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,840
They shouldn't have run.

124
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,640
Say!

125
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,160
How'd you like to kiss
my sister's black cat's ass?

126
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,840
This is better than a hog-killing!

127
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,920
Get them out of here!

128
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,720
We're holding you and your railroad
responsible for this carnage!

129
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,999
Innocent people are dead!

130
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,800
Women dying and mangled because
you used our town as a battlefield!

131
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,200
The railroad is going to pay
for our loss of blood!

132
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:06,560
We were trying to catch outlaws!

133
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,399
You lured them in here!

134
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,960
The railroad has been blabbing
about a big payload for weeks!

135
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,520
We represent the law!

136
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,760
Pike, is that you?

137
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:46,480
I can ride.

138
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,560
I can't see, but I can ride.

139
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,360
No!

140
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,160
I can't ride.

141
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,840
Finish it.

142
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,040
You boys want to move on,
or stay and give him...

143
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,360
...a decent burial?

144
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,860
He was a good man.

145
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:35,360
We should bury him.

146
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:36,559
He's dead!

147
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,960
He's got a lot of good men
to keep him company!

148
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:40,600
Too damn many!

149
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,720
I think the boys are right.

150
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,320
I'd like to say a few words for the dear,
dead departed.

151
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,120
Maybe a few hymns'd be in order!

152
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,560
Followed by a church supper...

153
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:56,280
...with a choir!

154
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,720
You crazy bastards, both of you!

155
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,860
Bishop, Engstrom...

156
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:13,359
...the Gorch brothers!

157
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,960
Amounts to a total of $4,500
and you let them ride out on you!

158
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,160
When the hard-money value
of these men you killed...

159
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,800
...less my commission, adds up to $500!

160
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,960
Any one of those pelts would've
not only cleared you with the company...

161
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,360
...but given you money to raise hell with!

162
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:33,480
We'll do better next time!

163
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,960
We'll do anything you say,
but we'd appreciate liquor money tonight.

164
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:41,520
There won't be any tonight!
You go after them in ten minutes!

165
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,800
Get them! Get Pike and you'll be rich!

166
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,260
If one of you tries to quit on me...

167
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,360
...I'll pay a bonus of $1,000...

168
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,240
...to the man that kills him!

169
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,520
Let's pack it up then!

170
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,760
- Why should I let you go with them?
- We've been over that.

171
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:19,040
You might join them again.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

172
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,320
What I like and what I need
are two different things. Listen.

173
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,260
I don't want to go back to prison,
never again.

174
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:28,960
It's got to be my way!
I need some good men!

175
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,759
You saw what happened out there!

176
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,460
Use what you have and see
that it doesn't happen again...

177
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:36,160
...or I'll see you spend the rest of your life
behind bars.

178
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:37,960
Try to run, I'll be after you and so will they.

179
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,159
I gave you my word.

180
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,280
We'll see what it's worth!

181
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,120
Six minutes.

182
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,159
Tell me...

183
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,060
...how does it feel...

184
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,960
...getting paid for it?

185
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,640
Getting paid to sit back and hire your
killings with the law's arms around you?

186
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,720
How's it feel to be so goddamn right?

187
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,359
Good.

188
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,440
You dirty son of a bitch!

189
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,080
You've got 30 days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

190
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,840
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.

191
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,560
I want all of them back here,
head down over a saddle.

192
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,600
Thirty days to get Pike
or 30 days back to Yuma.

193
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,620
I don't see nothing so lindo about it.

194
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:42,080
Just looks like more of Texas to me.

195
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,320
You have no eyes.

196
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,240
Got a half hour of light. Let's go.

197
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,080
Hello, little fella.

198
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,800
- Them other fellas-
- They're not coming!

199
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:16,999
- None of them?
- No.

200
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,880
- But I got horses and saddles for them.
- We'll need them, they won't.

201
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,920
Now, about the sharing up.

202
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,480
It will be the same as always.

203
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,840
Me and Tector don't think that
he ought to get the same amount.

204
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,000
He's just starting out,
and this is our opening for a new territory.

205
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,199
That's right.

206
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,440
I figure a share to that old goat for
watching the horses is a share too much.

207
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,960
So, we decided...

208
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,360
...it ain't fair.

209
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,280
If you two don't like equal shares,
why the hell don't you just take all of it?

210
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Why don't you answer me,
you damned, yellow-livered trash?

211
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:36,199
Now, Pike, you know...

212
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,280
I don't know a damned thing except
I either lead this bunch or end it now.

213
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,840
We divide it up just like you say.

214
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,160
Chick, chick, chick, chick.

215
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,599
Silver rings.

216
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,560
Silver rings, your butt!
Them's washers! Damn!

217
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,840
Bastards!

218
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,200
Washers!

219
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,480
We shot our way out of that town
for a dollar's worth of steel holes!

220
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,199
They set it up!

221
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,640
They? Who in the hell is "they"?

222
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,040
"They?"

223
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
"They" is just plain and fancy "they."

224
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:49,600
That's who "they" is.

225
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,240
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail!

226
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,160
Led you in and waltzed you out again!

227
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,720
Oh, my, what a bunch!

228
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,880
Big tough ones!

229
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,320
Here you are with a handful of holes,
a thumb up your ass...

230
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,400
...and a big grin to pass
the time of day with.

231
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,799
"They! "

232
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,880
Who the hell is "they"?

233
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
Railroad men.

234
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,080
Bounty hunters.

235
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,040
Deke Thornton.

236
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,840
Deke Thornton?

237
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,440
He was one of them?

238
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,080
How come you didn't know that?

239
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,760
Hey, gringo.

240
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
You can have my silver.

241
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Come on, don't kill me.

242
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,840
You can have the silver.

243
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,200
But don't kill me.

244
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,560
Please?

245
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,600
Go on...

246
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
...go for it.

247
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,920
Fall apart.

248
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,400
Walk softly, boys.

249
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,399
What's our next move?

250
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,880
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.

251
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,799
Three days, maybe.

252
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,480
We'll get the news and go to the border.

253
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,200
Maybe a payroll or a bank.

254
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:55,999
Maybe that damn railroad!

255
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,880
That damn railroad you're talking
about sure isn't getting no easier.

256
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,840
And you boys ain't getting any younger.

257
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,840
We must start thinking beyond our guns.

258
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,000
Those days are closing fast.

259
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
All your planning and talking
damn near got us shot...

260
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:22,520
...over a few lousy bags of washers.

261
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,960
This was going to be
me and Tector's last job!

262
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,599
We spent all our time and money
getting ready for this!

263
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,800
You spent time and money running whores
while I spent my stake setting it up!

264
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,160
I should have been running whores
instead of stealing army horses!

265
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,999
While you did the planning...

266
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,480
...me and Tector was getting
our bell rope pulled by two...

267
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,920
...two, mind you, Hondo whores!

268
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,600
And Pike was dreaming of washers!

269
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:03,960
He was.

270
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,360
You were matching whores...

271
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,840
...in tandem!

272
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,760
What's that?

273
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,920
One behind the other.

274
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,040
That's right! That's what we was doing!

275
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,440
Mr. Thornton?

276
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,080
You rode with Pike.

277
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,240
What kind of man are we up against?

278
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:56,680
The best.

279
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,320
He never got caught.

280
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,680
This was going to be my last.

281
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,800
Ain't getting around any better.

282
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,760
I'd like to make one good score
and back off.

283
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,800
Back off to what?

284
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,360
Have you got anything lined up?

285
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,720
Pershing's got troops spread out
all along the border.

286
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,680
Every one of those garrisons
will get a payroll.

287
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,640
That kind of information is kind of hard
to come by.

288
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,360
I didn't say it's going to be easy,
but it can be done.

289
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,480
He'll be waiting for us.

290
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,040
I wouldn't have it any other way.

291
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
Come on Pike, let's go.

292
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,439
You sound like you're all caught up.

293
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,840
Enough to know we've overstayed
our welcome.

294
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,639
What's wrong with you?

295
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,800
We've got plenty of money to spend,
and no worries.

296
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,240
They're not going to look for us
in their own backyard.

297
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:00,440
How can you be so damn sure?

298
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,760
Being sure is my business.

299
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,160
Being sure is my business.

300
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,640
Hold it!

301
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:10,839
Relax.

302
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,360
It's just some champagne we ordered.

303
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,240
Relax. It'sjust some champagne
we ordered.

304
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,160
Being sure is my business.

305
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,100
Did you get him?

306
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:33,560
No, he got away.

307
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,760
You sure must have hurt that railroad.

308
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,160
They spent a lot of money
setting up that ambush.

309
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,120
I caught up with them.

310
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,359
Two or three times.

311
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,159
There was a man named Harrigan.

312
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,760
He used to have a way of doing things.

313
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,920
I made him change his ways.

314
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,240
And a hell of a lot of people...

315
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,320
...just can't stand to be wrong.

316
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,880
Pride.

317
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,159
And they can't forget it.

318
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,840
That pride, being wrong, or learn by it.

319
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,560
How about us?

320
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,220
You reckon we learned...

321
00:33:18,221 --> 00:33:20,080
...being wrong today?

322
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,880
I sure hope to God we did.

323
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,680
Them's hot.

324
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
Damn!

325
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,280
Where in hell did you find him?

326
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,560
He ran with Thornton and me.

327
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,160
Did his share of killing, and more.

328
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:01,840
Around Langtry.

329
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Only now he does his killing
with a coffee cup.

330
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,640
I wouldn't have it any other way either.

331
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,840
Watch out, boys!

332
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,520
Take it easy!

333
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,320
Watch him, Tector!

334
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,000
That goddamned son of a bitch!

335
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,319
Get the horses up!

336
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,360
What the hell is going...

337
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,400
Damned old punk! Bastard!

338
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,880
Get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!

339
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,719
Help!

340
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,600
Get over here! Help!

341
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,840
What's the matter with you, old man?

342
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,040
Leave him alone!

343
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,560
He'll get us all killed!
I'm going to get rid of him.

344
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,400
No you're not! We're sticking together,
like it used to be.

345
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,680
When you side with a man, you stay with
him. If you can't, you're an animal!

346
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,440
You're finished!

347
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,640
We're finished! All of us!

348
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,960
Mount up.

349
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,280
Appears Brother Pike needs help.

350
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,720
That Brother Pike and the old man Sykes...

351
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:46,519
...makes a man wonder if it ain't time...

352
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,480
...to pick up his chips
and find another game.

353
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,960
How can you side anybody
when you can't get on your horse?

354
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,960
That was a fine talk you gave the boys
about sticking together.

355
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,280
That Gorch came near killing me.

356
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,800
Or me him.

357
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,719
Damned old fool like me's
not worth taking along!

358
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,320
- We started together, we'll end together.
- That's how I see it.

359
00:38:48,321 --> 00:38:51,000
That's the way it's always been with me.

360
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,280
Sorry about Deke.

361
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,560
I never figured him that way.

362
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,380
Back there in Starbuck...

363
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,240
...how did my boy do?

364
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,760
Your boy?

365
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,319
Crazy Lee?

366
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,360
Yes, C.L., Clarence Lee.

367
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,720
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.

368
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:14,040
I kill 'em now? I kill 'em now?

369
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,920
No, you just hold them here.

370
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,600
Why didn't you say he was your grandson?

371
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,000
You had enough things on your mind.

372
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,600
Besides, he had to pull his own weight
like the rest of us.

373
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,880
I just wanted to make sure he didn't
let you down, run, when things got hot.

374
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,480
He did fine.

375
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,800
Just fine.

376
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,040
All clear!

377
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,000
From here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.

378
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,480
What's the closest town of any size?

379
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,680
Agua Verde.

380
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,400
What's in Agua Verde?

381
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,240
Mexicans, what else?

382
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,760
A headquarters for regulars
fighting against Villa.

383
00:40:41,761 --> 00:40:43,560
Mapache territory.

384
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,280
Don't we follow?

385
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,000
No, we go back and wait.

386
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,440
We're supposed...

387
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:54,840
Shut up!

388
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,880
Why won't you tell your folks
to feed them dogs?

389
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,040
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.

390
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,439
I have invited you to my village.

391
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,400
Any disrespect to my family
or to my people...

392
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,839
...I will kill you.

393
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,440
Ashamed of having us meet your people?

394
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Yes. They don't know about
my life when I leave the village.

395
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,600
You got a sister?

396
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,040
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance...

397
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,280
...and that of your mama too.

398
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,040
That goes for your grandma too, sonny.

399
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,439
How bad was it?

400
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,680
Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung.

401
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,560
Our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.

402
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,040
What about the federal troops?
Didn't they protect you?

403
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:59,200
They were federal troops...

404
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,840
...commissioned by the traitor, Huerta.

405
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:04,240
And the soldier who shot my father?

406
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:06,039
What was his name?

407
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,200
- What does it matter?
- Your father died like a man.

408
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,840
The names are not important.

409
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,440
How was he called?

410
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,440
Mapache.

411
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,720
That is name enough.

412
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,000
In Mexico...

413
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,240
...these are the years of sadness.

414
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:26,960
But if we had...

415
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,839
...rifles like these...

416
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,200
And Teresa? Did they molest her?

417
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,200
She went with them
because she wished to.

418
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,839
She became the woman of Mapache...

419
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,880
...and the others.
She went with them, laughing.

420
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,520
Drunk with wine and love.

421
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,440
To him, Teresa was a goddess,
to be worshipped from afar.

422
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,720
I tell you, she was a mango...

423
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,039
...ripe and waiting.

424
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,080
Angel dreams of love
and Mapache eats the mango.

425
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,920
That's a good trick.

426
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,800
Now that I find hard to believe.

427
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,200
Not so hard.

428
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,560
We all dream of being a child again.

429
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,960
Even the worst of us.

430
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,720
Perhaps the worst most of all.

431
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,680
You know what we are, then?

432
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:40,720
Yes, just so, the both of you!

433
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,440
And you!

434
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,000
Where is Mapache?

435
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,600
All right, Pike? All right?

436
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,680
Tector, let's swap!

437
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,120
Come on, let's swap!

438
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,120
You must tell me. Where is Mapache?

439
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,280
Why do you wish to know?

440
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,360
For your father?

441
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,040
Or the whore?

442
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,320
Either you learn to live with it...

443
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,000
...or we'll leave you here.

444
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,280
I go with you.

445
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,200
You know what I'm going to do?
Steal his girl.

446
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,240
You are?

447
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,120
Here I go.

448
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,640
Dutch, I'm cutting in.

449
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:32,280
Come on, lady!

450
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,120
No gringos?

451
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,680
Only federales.

452
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,599
All soldiers...

453
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,960
...not a bounty hunter in sight.

454
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,760
Now, what the hell is that?

455
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,840
Atención!

456
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,120
I saw one just like it in Waco.

457
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,599
Run on steam?

458
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,400
No, on alcohol or gasoline.

459
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:02,199
You know what I heard?

460
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,680
I heard they got one of those things
up north that can fly.

461
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,200
That was a balloon, you damned old fool.

462
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:09,999
No, the old man's right.

463
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,600
They've got motors and wings
and go 60 miles in less than an hour.

464
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:15,840
Going to use them in the war.

465
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,399
Let's talk to the General...

466
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,320
...about his automobile
and our extra horses.

467
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,640
Nice and easy.

468
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,960
Do you know these Americans, General?

469
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,560
No, I don't know any Americans,
and these men even less.

470
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,600
Six beers, please.

471
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,440
Probably talking about us
behind our backs.

472
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,399
I'm down to about twenty in silver.

473
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,600
Since the Generalísimo cleaned out
this area, he ought to have a lot to spare.

474
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:40,440
Generalísimo, hell.

475
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
He's just another bandit
grabbing all he can for himself.

476
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:46,400
Like some others I could mention.

477
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,599
Not so as you'd know it.

478
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,640
We ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.

479
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,080
I hope someday these people kick
the scum like him into their graves.

480
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,000
We will.

481
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,480
If it takes forever!

482
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,800
General!

483
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,440
Look what I brought you.

484
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,000
- What a beautiful horse!
- It's for you.

485
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:27,199
For me?

486
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,800
It's my gift to you.

487
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:29,480
A thoroughbred.

488
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,240
Send him off to mate with my mare.

489
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,560
Then he'll be in shape to mate
with all the other mares.

490
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,040
And you, pretty brunette, come with me.

491
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,680
Look here.

492
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,360
Good looking old pony, ain't he?

493
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,960
Boy, do you know those beauties?

494
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,920
You left the village.

495
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,200
So what?

496
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,920
I left your stinking village...

497
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,280
...so I would not starve.

498
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,320
Look at me now, I'm happy.

499
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,320
Very happy.

500
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,120
I'm living with the big boss
of this place...

501
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,840
...General Mapache.

502
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,800
Come on.

503
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,560
She was my woman.

504
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,960
I know.

505
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,880
Sure ain't your woman no more.

506
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,760
Just look at her licking
inside that general's ear.

507
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,720
Bitch!

508
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,720
What's going on here?

509
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,400
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?

510
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,320
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.

511
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,280
She was his fiancée.

512
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,240
He went a little crazy
when he saw her with you.

513
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,200
Are you associated
with the American Army?

514
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,600
No, we're not associated with anybody.

515
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,999
I see.

516
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I was curious about the equipment
which you are carrying. That pistol...

517
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,200
...is restricted for the use
of army personnel.

518
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,400
It can't be purchased or even owned...

519
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,000
...legally.

520
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:45,199
Is that so?

521
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,280
Weapons are my specialty.

522
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,040
I am Commander Frederick Mohr
of the Imperial German Army.

523
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,400
It would be very useful for us
if we knew of some Americans...

524
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,000
...who did not share their
government's naive sentiments.

525
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,799
We share very few sentiments
with our government.

526
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,520
Perhaps we should invite these gentlemen
to have a drink with us.

527
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,440
He's inviting us for a drink.

528
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,000
Why not? Let's have a drink.

529
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,080
Good.

530
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,680
Shoot him.

531
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,760
I gave it to him, T.C.

532
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,940
Out! Stop praying!

533
00:57:09,941 --> 00:57:11,800
Enough! You old hags!

534
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,720
Out!

535
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:24,879
Here?

536
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,680
No, no, not there!

537
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,800
Wait, what are you going to do?

538
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,560
We got to show a little class here.

539
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,400
Right here!

540
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,079
It must be that garrison rail spur.

541
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,000
It's the easiest to hit, but I must find a way
to get it out of there.

542
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,280
What do you think?

543
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,679
Getting close to home.

544
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,320
Look at them gathered around the table.

545
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,360
Here we sit like kitchen help.

546
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,880
Why do you want us to hit that train
at the border?

547
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:27,760
Can't the General take over
the whole thing?

548
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,400
General Huerta is anxious
to better relations with the US...

549
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,960
...not to cross the border
and destroy them.

550
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,880
Usually these arms shipments
are kept pretty secret.

551
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,479
How'd you find out about this?

552
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,600
Mapache has a superb intelligence force
organized by my commanding officer.

553
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,079
Now, gentlemen...

554
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,240
...we are well organized...

555
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,760
...and able to pay $10,000...

556
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,000
...in gold.

557
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,360
If you're not able to do the work,
we'll find someone else.

558
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,480
We can do it. But we're
going to need equipment.

559
00:59:01,481 --> 00:59:03,080
Do not worry.

560
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,400
Our accountant will take care of it.

561
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,760
General...

562
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,440
...soon you will be the best
equipped general in Mexico.

563
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,440
Look here...

564
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,760
...ain't he the one.

565
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,040
To the host!

566
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,680
With your permission...

567
00:59:35,681 --> 00:59:36,879
...I need a bath.

568
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,920
With my permission,
I think you all need a bath.

569
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,280
I don't!

570
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,920
What me and Tector need
is them women you're hogging.

571
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,440
Can you fix that up for us?

572
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,079
Gentlemen...

573
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,880
...you will excuse me.

574
00:59:57,881 --> 00:59:59,320
I'm sure.

575
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,679
Herrera.

576
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,400
Let's get Angel.

577
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,600
I need him.

578
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,480
I'll give you someone
much better than that.

579
01:00:24,481 --> 01:00:27,080
If you don't mind, I'll make my own choice.

580
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,840
Let them take him away, General.

581
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,079
All right.

582
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,200
He is not important to me.

583
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,920
Take him.

584
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,560
I think we're gonna get on the wagon now.

585
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,440
Hey, here come our sweeties.

586
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,039
Ain't them pretty?

587
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,000
I don't know about yours, Lyle,
but I think...

588
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,000
...I got more than I can handle.

589
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,080
Hey, get out of them...

590
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,600
You know what they told me?

591
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,480
The dons of Spain built this
over 300 years ago.

592
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,040
Is that right?

593
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,440
That's right.

594
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,320
I tell you, Lyle, I'm all for them dons.

595
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,200
Let's have a little target.

596
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,920
She won't get away. Turn her loose.

597
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,240
Why not!

598
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,920
Tector, look at them beauties!

599
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,800
How in the hell can you stand it that hot?

600
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,520
I'm going to build me one of these
some day and live in it.

601
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,400
Hell, Lyle, look here.

602
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,600
Come on, sweetheart,
let me see your teatsies.

603
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,239
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.

604
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,360
I'm not going to steal guns for that devil
to rob and kill my people again.

605
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,120
Noble, noble. Very noble.

606
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,280
I didn't see no tears on your cheeks
when you rode in from Starbuck.

607
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,680
They were not my people.

608
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,120
I care about my people, my village.

609
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,600
Listen, boy, you ride with us,
your village don't count.

610
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,160
If it does, you don't go along.

611
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,200
Then I don't go along.

612
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,400
Angel, one load of guns ain't going
to stop them raiding villages.

613
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,440
Think about all the money you'll have.

614
01:03:56,441 --> 01:03:58,940
Buy them a ranch. Move them 1,000 miles.

615
01:03:58,941 --> 01:04:01,440
- Buy them two or three ranches.
- One.

616
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,200
A very small one.

617
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,680
Don't you see? This is their land.

618
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,440
No one will drive them away.

619
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,880
I'll drink to that sentiment.

620
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,600
And to love.

621
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,360
But most of all, I'll drink to gold!

622
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,320
You're a pain in the ass.

623
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,880
Would you give guns to someone
to kill your father...

624
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,039
...or your mother, or your brother?

625
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:45,000
Ten thousand cuts an awful lot
of family ties.

626
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,240
My people have no guns.

627
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,560
But with guns...

628
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,320
...my people could fight.

629
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,840
If I could take guns...

630
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,039
...I would come with you.

631
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,640
How many cases of rifles
did Zamorra say was in that shipment?

632
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,240
Sixteen.

633
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,640
Give him one.

634
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,120
All right.

635
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,360
One case and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.

636
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,200
I will.

637
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,400
We know you will.

638
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,240
Sure glad we got that settled.

639
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:36,080
Why, you reprobate!

640
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,200
Boys...

641
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,840
...I want you to meet my fiancée.

642
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,200
They just got engaged.

643
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,560
I'm a son of a bitch!

644
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,480
Trot them on in, fellas.

645
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,120
I'm hell on packing mules,
but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.

646
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,520
You want to gamble everything
that this one shipment will be attacked?

647
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:24,400
If they're in Agua Verde, they'll try for it.

648
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,520
- If? What about Juarez?
- If he was, we would've heard about it.

649
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:30,520
If they are in Agua Verde,
they will have seen Mapache.

650
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,319
And who in hell is Mapache?

651
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,320
A killer for Huerta who
calls himself a general.

652
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:37,119
He's been fighting Villa and losing.

653
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,720
But with enough guns, he could become
a power in northern Mexico.

654
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:42,519
Pike will try to get them for him.

655
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,320
How? The train will be guarded
by regular troops.

656
01:06:45,321 --> 01:06:48,120
Not regular troops,
green recruits not worth a damn.

657
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,040
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.

658
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,719
And not this...

659
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,080
...gutter trash you've given me.

660
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,680
What you've got is 24 more days.

661
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,920
Never told me how you got
all torn up like that.

662
01:07:14,921 --> 01:07:17,280
I met a woman I wanted to marry.

663
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,320
Is your husband coming back?

664
01:07:35,321 --> 01:07:36,520
No.

665
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,120
He's never coming back.

666
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,880
But you are late.

667
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,020
Two days late.

668
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,519
She had a husband.

669
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,200
If I had any sense, I'd have killed him.

670
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,080
He wasn't around.

671
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,800
I got careless.

672
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,319
One night, he walked in on us.

673
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:03,000
Caught her with the first shot,
and got me here with the second.

674
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,840
Then the coward turned and ran.

675
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,119
Ever catch up with him?

676
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,960
No, but there isn't an hour that
passes that I don't think about it.

677
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,800
Come on! We've got a long way!

678
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,960
This is our last go around, Dutch.

679
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,640
This time, we do it right.

680
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,480
Just do your work.

681
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,560
Let's go!

682
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,000
They're coming!

683
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,000
They're coming!

684
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,080
Faster!

685
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,960
Get over!

686
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,480
Get that ramp up!

687
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,680
Get that horse out of here!

688
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,320
Bring them all out! Get them out!

689
01:16:48,321 --> 01:16:49,960
Get over here!

690
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,680
Get them over here! Get those horses!

691
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,519
Hurry!

692
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,320
Your horse kicked me.

693
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:32,300
Run them up along here!

694
01:17:32,301 --> 01:17:34,280
Where the hell is my horse?

695
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,319
Hey, we got grenades!

696
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,280
- Hurry! We gotta get out of here!
- Be careful!

697
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,080
Let's go on this.

698
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,040
Here we go.

699
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,120
Line up in two columns!

700
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,000
Corporal, give us a hand here!

701
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,240
We're all ready!

702
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,160
Let's go!

703
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,320
Come on!
