Thanks to Jack1st!
HxHPRC: Enjoy your hours!

3
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:45,045
- Morning, Mr. Clark.
- Morning, Hunter.

4
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,417
- Hi, Carolyn. Hey, Scotty.
- Morning.

5
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,712
Scotty, can you get the front door?
And don't drop those eggs.

6
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,882
- Your father needs them for experiments.
- Okay, Mom.

7
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,723
Calm down, Buddy. It's just me.

8
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,559
Buddy, we're home.

9
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,481
Calm down, Buddy. It's just me.

10
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,192
Buddy!

11
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,736
Oh, Buddy.

12
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,696
Buddy!

13
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,828
Buddy! !

14
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,787
My beautiful pie.

15
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,503
Bad dog!

16
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,018
Get out, get out, get out!
Out, you animal!

17
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,626
Control here.

18
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,253
We've got a serious problem.

19
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,233
My God. Get the best
doggone agent you can in there. Go!

20
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:39,882
Gentlemen, a few moments ago
I received word of the gravest nature.

21
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,928
The key agent working the Brody case
has been catnapped.

22
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,768
Although he is safe, we must
replace him as soon as possible.

23
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:56,148
It appears that once again we find
ourselves threatened...

24
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,234
...by the great cat menace.

25
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,618
We suspect that a rogue feline
is involved in a conspiracy...

26
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:12,164
... to destroy all we dogs
have worked so hard to achieve.

27
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,547
Therefore, in accordance
with Plan Delta...

28
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,300
... we have assembled
an elite team of agents...

29
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,346
... trained to replace
our catnapped comrade.

30
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,433
At this moment, replacements
are flying in from London.

31
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,978
One will take his place
as the Brodys' pet...

32
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,398
...and guard their home
from cat invasion.

33
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:44,321
I need not remind you that
the future of man and dog alike...

34
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,075
...depends on the success
of this mission.

35
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,870
Failure is not an option.

36
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,832
The stakes are high.
We have everything to lose.

37
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,420
One hundred million dogs
have placed their destiny...

38
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,590
...squarely in our paws.

39
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,892
- I'll bite your ear.
- Get off me!

40
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,604
- That's my eye you're poking.
- Coming through!

41
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,274
Pardon me. Step aside. Coming through.

42
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,901
Out of the way. Clear the area.

43
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,404
- Not again.
- What is it this time?

44
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,241
I don't think this is a good idea.

45
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,577
I can't believe this guy.

46
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,412
When I pull this rope. . .

47
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,914
What is he doing?

48
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,626
. . .the sack will fall on the pitchfork
and send me out the window. . .

49
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,254
. . .and on the way to freedom,
so step back.

50
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,425
- What is it with you?
- Me? What's with you?

51
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,931
I want adventure. Not wait for someone
to take me to some boring house.

52
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,434
What's wrong with
a family that loves you?

53
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,145
Free food, a warm place to sleep.

54
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,773
And you could go to the bathroom
wherever you want.

55
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,943
Don't you want to do
something exciting?

56
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,571
Like be a police dog!
No?

57
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,534
Or a Russian space dog!
Or sample the great bones of Europe!

58
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,287
Come on, guys.

59
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:19,333
Oh, forget it.
See you puppies later.

60
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,419
Oh, boy, I can't watch.

61
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:23,795
This ought to be good.

62
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,464
World, here I come!

63
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,970
Look, he's flying.

64
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,058
No, he's not.

65
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,687
Back from your adventure so soon,
Scooby-Doofus?

66
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,147
Where am I?

67
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,203
What's that?

68
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,999
- Somebody go look.
- You go.

69
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,464
All right! Into the hole!

70
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,551
Let's go! Top-secret operation!
Into the hole!

71
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,261
Double-time!
Into the hole!

72
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,139
I've seen better hustle
on a dashboard Chihuahua. Wag it!

73
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,780
Howdy. Over here!

74
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,285
Down, Clucky!
That's one angry chicken.

75
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,495
Front and center, agents!

76
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,831
Hup, hup, hup!
Go! Let's go, ladies!

77
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,166
Straight line! Ears up! Move it!

78
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,878
Don't make me muzzle you!
Want a chew toy?

79
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,881
- You wanted excitement?
- Sir, yes, sir!

80
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,050
- You wanted adventure?
- Sir, yes, sir!

81
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,969
If you're chosen by the Brody woman. . .

82
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:57,055
. . .you will be briefed on arrival.
Are you ready?

83
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,348
Sir, yes, sir!

84
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,100
Good luck, men.

85
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,104
These are the cutest beagles
you've ever seen.

86
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,274
Over here.

87
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,653
For God's sake,
don't forget to wag those tails!

88
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,241
They sounded perfect
from what you said.

89
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,910
They're so cute.

90
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,629
They've really changed in size. . .

91
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,422
. . .and color.

92
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,217
And breed.

93
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,817
He is adorable.

94
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,779
Hello!

95
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,741
And you're going to come home with me.
Yes, you are.

96
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,580
Not good!

97
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,594
Honey? I'll be right there.

98
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,973
Hi, sweetheart.

99
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,643
I have a surprise for you.

100
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,229
A new puppy!

101
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,858
But, Mom, Buddy may still come back.

102
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,945
I'm sorry, hon.
I know that it's been a month.

103
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,949
But remember how happy we were
when we found Buddy?

104
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:43,537
I bet he's making a new family
just as happy right now.

105
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,957
Look at him.

106
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,293
And your father does need him for work.

107
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:55,674
You could play catch, you could
play Frisbee and hide-and-go-seek.

108
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,885
Yes. Perfect.

109
00:11:58,302 --> 00:11:59,845
Let me see.

110
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,599
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let me see.

111
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,392
Dander.

112
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,602
Standard composition.

113
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,396
Retinal response. . . .

114
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,525
Normal. Proboscis viscosity. . . .

115
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:19,323
Not too acid, not too alkaline.
All right, immune response.

116
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,539
That's excellent!

117
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,501
That's good! Now. . .

118
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:34,087
. . .a little protein synthesis and
an electrostatic. . . .

119
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:36,715
So. . . .

120
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,636
I know. Why don't you name him?

121
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,889
Okay. How about "Loser"?

122
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,725
It's a dog, Mom.

123
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,145
You're not a loser, are you?

124
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,234
Wait.
Lou.

125
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,486
We'll call you Lou.

126
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,116
No playing in the good living room.

127
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:07,746
That carpet is Uzbekistani.
Ten thousand thread count.

128
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,584
What?

129
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,424
Loser.

130
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,926
Cat person.

131
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,096
Okay, here's the plan:

132
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,474
Get off this patio,
get back to the barn. . .

133
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,227
. . .get a better pitchfork.

134
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,655
Cool.

135
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,960
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

136
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,132
I like your spirit,
but do me a favor and stand back.

137
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,717
That's my biscuit.

138
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,764
That would've been
the shortest assignment in history.

139
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,932
Where you going?

140
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,644
I guess HQ ain't training
the way they used to.

141
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,314
- Who exactly are you?
- Name's Butch.

142
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:20,152
What stupid name did the bipeds
saddle you with? Spot? Fifi? Rover?

143
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,196
- Lou.
- God forbid.

144
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,073
Oh, Lou. Sorry.

145
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:29,161
Is that boy always so grumpy?
Maybe they should switch his food.

146
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,832
Humans can get a little emotional.
You'll get used to it. Come on.

147
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,011
Where's that coming from?

148
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,223
Cool.

149
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,350
What? It's standard equipment.

150
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:55,854
EC-three vid-phone, research archive
database, cipher charts, Snausages.

151
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,023
- Hey, what's this?
- Heel!

152
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:02,069
That's the big button.
You don't just press the big button.

153
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,612
- Jeez.
- Sorry.

154
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,697
Just try to remember your training.

155
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,576
Let's get started. Here's the skinny:

156
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,037
Your new master's a scientist.

157
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,082
He's been working
on a cure for dog allergies.

158
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,878
It's a big deal. If no one's allergic
to dogs, we'll have the advantage.

159
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:24,675
This was your predecessor:
Agent 1 364, AIKA Buddy.

160
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,927
He was catnapped about a month ago.

161
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,680
Wasn't on top of his game.
He had to retire.

162
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,558
He got a nice condo in Boca.
Lucky dog.

163
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,226
You're here to replace him.

164
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,187
And to keep the cats away
from the formula.

165
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,065
Can't let them near that.
Now, come on.

166
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,571
All right, agent, let's meet the team.

167
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,157
"Agent" !
Whoa!

168
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,579
Kid, look over there.

169
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,622
- That's Peek.
- Peek?

170
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,791
I don't get it.

171
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,294
Peek, show yourself.

172
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,092
We got a calico on the corner
of Center and Main....

173
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,012
Oh, my God!

174
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,931
Peek's early warning.

175
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:17,769
He's got it all. Radar, sonar,
thermo-imaging, odor-matrixing.

176
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:22,024
He can detect a non-residential cat
from three blocks away.

177
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,860
- Peek, fall in.
- Roger that.

178
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,577
- Sam, what's your 20?
- One-eighteenth of a klick east.

179
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,623
I'm going to backtrack using
a delta approach in three...

180
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,958
. . .two. . .one.

181
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:46,965
Oh, no, not again.

182
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,717
Where am I?

183
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,683
Over here, Sam.

184
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,979
Request permission to pant heavily, sir.

185
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:01,980
Granted.

186
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,527
Boys, I want you to meet Lou.

187
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,694
- Hey, Louie.
- Hey, Lou.

188
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:08,904
Human!

189
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,043
Lou's taking over for Buddy.
He's in the hot seat.

190
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,672
Fresh from the academy, he's
up to date on the latest techniques.

191
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,382
Aren't you, Lou?

192
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:34,137
You know this one? Here we come.
I got you! Oh, I just missed you.

193
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:36,223
Holy Chihuahua.

194
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,516
How did this happen?

195
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,268
He accidentally slipped through.

196
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,691
He's still got his you-know-whats!

197
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:49,862
There's no time, Butch. The puppy
stays. End of discussion. Out.

198
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,413
So tell me, one of you. . .

199
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,707
. . .is the dog out of the way?

200
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,296
Did the puppy fall for my clever trap?

201
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,050
None of you have a tale to tell?

202
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,846
A little story for me, perhaps?

203
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,392
You! Tell me, is the game afoot?

204
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:21,894
Yes?

205
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,022
- Why is the game afoot?
- I mean, no.

206
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,690
Ah, excellent.

207
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,526
So the puppy is dead.
Now we can move on to--

208
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:30,944
Wait, wait.

209
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,779
Can I change my answer?

210
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,656
Is the puppy alive or not?

211
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,075
Another dog told him it was a bomb.

212
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,037
Another dog?

213
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:45,501
Anyway, I am sure we'll get into the
basement lab just fine. Right, guys?

214
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,961
- Guys!
- Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.

215
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,047
- Absolutely.
- See?

216
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:53,217
Project Dark Cloud should go down
without a hitch.

217
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,970
Dark Cloud?
Is that what I'm calling my plan?

218
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,348
Not that I know of.
No, you're calling it. . . .

219
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,183
- How about Storm!
- Dark Storm.

220
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,310
Dark Storm, yes.

221
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,313
Yes. Like a powerful, dark storm. . .

222
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:09,358
. . .I will make my presence
known to the world.

223
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,451
. . .and make them quake in fear
at the very mention of my name!

224
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,662
Mr. Tinkles!

225
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:23,956
- Hide!
- Quickly!

226
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,958
Where are you?

227
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,125
Hide!

228
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,838
There you are, Mr. Tinkles.

229
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:36,927
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Where have you been?

230
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,264
Mr. Mason will be so pleased
to see you.

231
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,100
I'll take you to him.

232
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,313
You're a stinky kitty.

233
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:51,024
First you have to have a bath.

234
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:55,195
Mr. Tinkles, don't forget
to wash behind the ears!

235
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:01,702
If I'm going to be a secret agent,
I should have a better name.

236
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,333
He's a pro wrestler.
That name's taken.

237
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,335
Then "Doom Machine" it is.

238
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:14,715
You can call yourself
Squicky the Space Dog for all I care.

239
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,593
That don't make your behind
a rocket pack.

240
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:21,805
You are not an agent,
but you are going to help us.

241
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:26,143
So first things first.
Kid, pay attention.

242
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,561
History 1 01 :

243
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,230
Dogs have always been
man's best friend.

244
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,857
I'm sure even you know that.

245
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,401
But cats, they're another story.

246
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,320
Peek, start with ancient Egypt.

247
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,156
We've seen that 5 billion times.

248
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:41,742
Okay. Never mind.
Sorry. Here goes.

249
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,495
Ancient Egypt.

250
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:48,999
See these hieroglyphics?

251
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,544
Humans read them and say that
ancient people worshiped cats.

252
00:20:56,048 --> 00:21:01,136
An evil cat named Shen-Akh-Akumon made
them build pyramids, monuments. . .

253
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:04,348
. . .and treated them like they
were his litter box.

254
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,725
Things were terrible.

255
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:07,935
This is the best part.

256
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:12,356
So the dogs,
being man's best friend, rose up.

257
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,818
And put them down.

258
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:22,574
With humans being back on top, we
took our natural place at their side.

259
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,785
And the people just forgot?

260
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:28,121
Remember, they're a very
primitive species.

261
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,582
Can't sense earthquakes, smell fear.

262
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,419
Heck, they can't even take
responsibility for their own farts.

263
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,506
Gross.

264
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:38,966
Guilty.

265
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,509
I'll get the fence.

266
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:43,470
That's how our outfit got started.

267
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,392
Sometimes a rogue cat gets too big for
his coat and thinks he can take over.

268
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,521
Our mission's to keep the cats from
the lab until he finishes the formula.

269
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,859
- Anything weird, call us on the collar.
- Yes, sir!

270
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,152
- Any questions?
- Just one, sir.

271
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,446
- Shoot.
- What's ancient Egypt?

272
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,284
Freeze, cat.

273
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:06,785
I'm an agent.

274
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,454
I'm so fast, I can't see myself.

275
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:12,499
Agent Doom Machine. That's right.

276
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,377
Watch out, cat.
I couldn't even see it.

277
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:18,213
There's a good puppy. Hello!

278
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,966
Don't get scared. Don't get scared.

279
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:24,595
Look how good you're being.
Look how good.

280
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:27,306
Where's that--? There. I got it.

281
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,057
This won't hurt a bit.

282
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,815
Let's see. Let's see.

283
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,282
Hey, that's good.

284
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,167
- Hey, Dad!
- Boils.

285
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:56,919
Want to help me practice?

286
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,089
No. No.

287
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,158
I forgot your bow.

288
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:32,120
Oh, your pretty bow.

289
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:36,625
When I rule the Earth, you will be the
first. . .

290
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,460
. . .on my list.

291
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:41,255
Keep your hair like that.
It's slimming.

292
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,382
There's room on that list for you.

293
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:45,050
No, I mean it.

294
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,303
We only have a few days to succeed.

295
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,433
Although playing pet for that sick old
man upstairs is key to my scheme. . .

296
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:58,063
. . .I cannot stand this humiliation
any longer. Am I clear?

297
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:02,818
Never mind.
The puppy won't survive the night.

298
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,403
Send in the ninjas.

299
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,536
Nervous about the tryouts tomorrow?

300
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,288
No.

301
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,###
- It's okay to be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

302
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,878
I stink, but I'm not nervous.

303
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:26,091
Is he saying that because
he needs me to reassure him?

304
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,261
Yes. Reassure him.

305
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:34,016
You're the most wonderful,
great, charming, good looking. . .

306
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,395
. . .boy in the whole wide world.

307
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:44,318
- Maybe your dad could help you.
- No, I'm pretty sure he stinks too.

308
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,695
I'm going to talk to him.

309
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,823
Time for bed. Turn off the TV.

310
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,867
- Five minutes.
- Seven.

311
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,746
- Love you.
- I love you too.

312
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,873
Well? Hand it over.

313
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:01,084
What?! No gravy?

314
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,839
Next time remember the gravy.

315
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,386
Going someplace?

316
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,431
Now, let's see.

317
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,894
Ooh, yeah. 1409 Maple Terrace.

318
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,729
I got him.

319
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:25,108
Total covert operation.
Got to be like a Stealth.

320
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,500
Hey, Sam.

321
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:55,514
On my mark. Three, two, one.

322
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,016
Banzai!

323
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:07,609
Lou, it's Peek.

324
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,736
Lou. Are you there? It's Peek.

325
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,614
What? What? Where?

326
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,741
I'm picking up a faint signal.

327
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:18,412
Maybe it's a glitch.
You better check it out.

328
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:20,330
Okay. I'll go look.

329
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,291
Be careful, kid.

330
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,543
I'm an agent.

331
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,837
I'm a secret agent.

332
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:30,048
I'm a one-dog army.

333
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,909
Turn over.

334
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,002
Bug activated.

335
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:20,432
Peek? Hello? Peek?

336
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:22,267
Seems clear.

337
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:25,771
Probably just a squirrel.
I'll let Butch know.

338
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,698
- Butch, what do I do?
- Bite them.

339
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,304
What?

340
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,235
Just do as I say.

341
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:14,862
Left! Right paw! Again!

342
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:18,949
Roll over!

343
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,660
That's a good doggy. Paws up!

344
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:24,204
Donkey kick!

345
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,999
Come on, kid, give them the haymaker!

346
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:38,719
I changed my mind.
Call me the Claw of Ling Chow!

347
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,304
Ling Chow this!

348
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,100
Clean up on aisle 7.

349
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:47,853
Humans! Retreat with honor.

350
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,563
I have a bat.

351
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,816
I have a mitt,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

352
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:07,456
Bad dog.

353
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,173
You're lucky you're so cute.

354
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,852
- Doom Machine.
- Hey, guys.

355
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:32,898
- You're still alive.
- Yep. All five limbs.

356
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:35,984
You owe me five smoked pig ears.

357
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:38,695
You're still standing.
You all right?

358
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:42,366
Did you see me?
Right, left and right and left--

359
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:46,036
You got cocky.
You think this is a game?

360
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:49,665
This isn't about code names,
little boys, or friends.

361
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:53,168
It's about guarding that lab.
Nothing else.

362
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,755
Sam, Peek, seal that chimney.

363
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:18,235
Cats.

364
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,406
Don't they ever quit?

365
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:44,553
The Brodys have the best garbage.

366
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,847
- Go on. Take a bite.
- Oh, my.

367
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,642
This is what they get to eat?
What a gyp.

368
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,477
I'm glad you liked it.

369
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:56,648
- I thought I was a stray too long.
- Stray? Cool.

370
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,817
I've never met a stray.

371
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,820
Actually, I prefer
"domestically challenged."

372
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,990
Miss Challenged, sorry,
but you gotta leave.

373
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,659
- My orders are clear. I can't--
- Orders?

374
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,828
Yep. I'm a secret agent.

375
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:11,663
An agent?

376
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,792
You're small for an agent.
Shouldn't you be having fun?

377
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:17,503
I don't have time.

378
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,089
Tough guy.

379
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,887
Stop with the agent stuff. Okay?

380
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:32,476
You have your own kid to play with.
Don't take it for granted.

381
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,858
Where you going?
Could you do that again?

382
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:44,488
Next time the boy talks to you,
tilt your head and perk your ears.

383
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,074
You'll see what I'm talking about.

384
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:52,329
And do me a favor.
Tell Butch Ivy's back in town.

385
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:03,090
What're you looking at?

386
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:08,053
I guess you're kind of cute.

387
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,392
Look who it is. I got you.

388
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:19,940
Last night your mother and I
had a conversation. . .

389
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,317
. . .that made me think that maybe. . .

390
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,820
. . .you and I should talk. . .

391
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:27,781
. . .about you and me
and my big project.

392
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,950
You want to sit down?

393
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,953
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

394
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:36,790
Your mom made me think that. . . .

395
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:41,503
Well, I'm coming to your
soccer tryout this afternoon.

396
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,463
No, you don't have to.

397
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:44,673
But. . . .

398
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:48,677
Really?

399
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,387
Okay.

400
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:51,680
Yeah! Okay.

401
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,433
- Oh, good. Cool. Cool.
- Cool.

402
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:57,686
You don't want to be late for school.

403
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,272
Yeah, I am.

404
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:03,025
- See you, Dad.
- See you.

405
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:06,945
Go, go, go! I'll be cheering for you!

406
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:12,242
Our team is red-hot
Your team ain't doodly-squat

407
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:28,926
I stunk. Worse than stunk.

408
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,803
Scotty? Have you seen this little--

409
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,055
Tryouts!

410
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,020
Wow. He really does stink.

411
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:43,982
Guess it didn't go so well, huh?

412
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:45,734
What did the coach say?

413
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:51,281
He said tryouts for the girls' team
are on Monday.

414
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:13,554
- Soccer.
- I'm in the middle--

415
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,807
- Soccer.
- No, thank you. I must get--

416
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,350
Soccer.

417
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:24,231
- I forgot. I had a breakthrough--
- I know you're busy. . . .

418
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,149
He is your son.

419
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:29,319
I had a breakthrough.

420
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:35,200
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

421
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,319
Good boy.

422
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:11,987
A beautiful sight.

423
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:14,323
You said we'd not talk again.

424
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:17,618
- Now I have a reason.
- Spare me the lecture.

425
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:27,085
Forgive me for not teaching him
the finer points of being scratched.

426
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:29,254
Now, I have a job to do.

427
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:33,425
You never complained
when your belly was scratched.

428
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,553
Under the moon?
Before a mission?

429
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:39,473
You'd call me Lamb Chop
and blush. . .

430
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:42,267
. . .whenever I called you Liver Snap.

431
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,104
Bringing up history...

432
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:49,900
. . .is barking up the wrong tree.
I'll say this once:

433
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,237
Stay away from the kid.

434
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:59,284
Mr. Mason, I have someone
to see you.

435
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:03,747
It's Mr. Tinkles time, Mr. Mason.

436
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:10,254
Tonight he's wearing something
very special for you.

437
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,922
There.

438
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:17,511
Does that make you happy, Mr. Mason?
Are you happy now?

439
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,946
See how happy you make him?
You make his heart go "boop."

440
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:39,032
I leave you two young things together.

441
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:47,165
Evil does not wear a bonnet!

442
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:49,543
Is she gone?

443
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:55,007
Did Genghis Khan wear a bonnet?
Attila the Hun? No.

444
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,177
He wore a furry hat.
Maybe a black bonnet?

445
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:03,348
The ninjas failed.
Failure is unacceptable.

446
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:07,227
If they show their faces,
you know what to do.

447
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:11,190
Tell them to wash with a
loofah sponge. Kidding.

448
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,985
This can't be happening.
I want them eliminated!

449
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:21,158
Maybe we can look at the glass
as half-full.

450
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,952
That's what I like to do.

451
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:28,248
Putting a happy face on things.
Interesting philosophy.

452
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,835
Did you forget we're
taking over the world?!

453
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:33,378
The clock's ticking.

454
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:36,590
We've a small margin for error.
Tomorrow. . .

455
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:40,594
. . .you will send in the Russian.

456
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,307
I'll call you back.

457
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:59,363
A disturbance occurred
at a top-secret allergy...

458
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:00,906
...research lab.

459
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,867
Bogey in the wire.

460
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:05,452
- You got him?
- No.

461
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:06,703
Closing fast.

462
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,122
I can't see.
There's a fog.

463
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:12,042
It's your hair, Sam. Blow up.

464
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,921
Hold on. Mom's back.

465
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,424
Oh, no.

466
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,468
Look at the little kitty.

467
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:24,847
Look at the kitty. Oh, yeah.

468
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:27,224
That's a good boy.

469
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:29,726
He's just a little lost kitty.

470
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:33,647
And we're going to keep him.
Yes, we are.

471
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:35,816
Don't eat her.

472
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:41,280
Oh, look. See?

473
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,448
Look how much she likes you.

474
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:46,118
Dave, I've run into a bit a snag.

475
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:50,247
You'll have to show the house
without me. Oh, hang on.

476
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:55,419
What is that?
Is that a hairball?

477
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:59,923
I'll go get you some water.
Not you, Dave. I'll be there soon.

478
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,009
Hang on.

479
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,889
I'm on to you.
You're in trouble.

480
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:10,100
I think not, baby puppy.
You are in trouble.

481
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,147
Yuck!

482
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,820
From Russia with love.

483
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,280
Stealth poop.

484
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,162
I don't have time for this.

485
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:31,872
Bad dog.

486
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:34,499
What do we got?

487
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,794
- A Russian Blue.
- And a number 2 in sector 3.

488
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:40,631
That steamer was bigger than me.

489
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,133
Nice work.
Sit this one out.

490
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:45,844
- Is she gone?
- I don't see her.

491
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:48,722
But I was framed!
Wait, I want to help.

492
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:52,100
- Look out. Code 4.
- Quick, smell my butt.

493
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,270
All right, break it up.

494
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,606
Cold nose!

495
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:04,238
Piece of junk American door.

496
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:13,956
I cannot believe I do this job
for half price.

497
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:19,086
And this Tinkles, he is jerk.
He talk too much and shed all over.

498
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:20,879
- Moving fast.
- Moving west.

499
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:24,383
- Moving west-east.
- On her way to the corner.

500
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,885
- And she's out.
- And she's out.

501
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,978
Oh, man, it's locked.

502
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:42,484
What do they know? I work hard,
bring home the Meow Mix.

503
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,280
- What's he doing?
- Kid!

504
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:47,781
What? Dogs!

505
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,453
Take this!

506
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:57,###
Missed.

507
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,170
Run!

508
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:02,588
Come on, kid. Hurry!

509
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,181
Watch it! He's coming in!

510
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:22,024
- There's a bomb at the lab door.
- We're on it.

511
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:24,985
Doggies, why not come out and play?

512
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:27,237
- Guys!
- Come on, man!

513
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,989
The bomb. The bomb!

514
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,991
I'm going for the bomb.

515
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,956
- You distract him.
- Why me?

516
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,918
- You wanted to help.
- Come on! Come on!

517
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,630
- Stupid cat!
- That'll get his attention.

518
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:05,484
- The dresser's coming down.
- No, no!

519
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:10,572
Butch. The bomb.
You got 45 seconds.

520
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,574
I said we're on it.

521
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,494
You need anger management.

522
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,121
Boomerang!

523
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:26,129
Look out, kid!

524
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,050
Nice catch.

525
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,181
Human!

526
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,322
Phone.

527
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,261
Hang on, Butch!

528
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:16,138
Hey, puppy, fetch.

529
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:17,598
No! Wait!

530
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:19,224
All right!

531
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:26,481
A flying dog.

532
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:31,278
Hold on, kid.

533
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:32,613
- Hurry! The bomb!
- The bomb.

534
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:35,240
- Get off me, furball!
- Fight!

535
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:37,910
Take him.
I'll go for the bomb.

536
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:39,286
Ten seconds.

537
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:41,246
You fight like a poodle.

538
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,582
The book says cut the red wire.

539
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,084
We're dogs. We're colorblind!

540
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,795
Right. The dark gray one!
Oh, no.

541
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:50,547
Don't touch it!

542
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:51,882
Come on.

543
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:52,966
Please!

544
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:55,052
That's the one!

545
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,437
Think you have won?
Remote detonator!

546
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,860
Oh, good.

547
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,820
Come here, Lou.

548
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:17,533
- Nice outfit.
- Come here.

549
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:19,409
Ouch!

550
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,286
Hang on. Good doggy.

551
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:28,794
It's bulbous.

552
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:30,128
That's a breakthrough.
If I can only find. . . .

553
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:34,883
. . .a little protein synthesis
and an electrostatic charge. . .

554
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,094
. . .it should sustain
the compound. . . .

555
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:42,641
Good job with the boomerang.
You're acting like an agent.

556
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:46,937
- Was that a compliment?
- He never compliments me.

557
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:51,108
Sam, Peek, call in a clean-up crew.

558
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:58,907
Hello? Here, kitty, kitty.

559
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:02,119
Here, little kitty, kitty.

560
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:06,415
I have a treat for you.
Here, kitty, kitty--

561
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,919
Oh, my God.

562
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,131
Who left the window open?

563
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:19,678
Here, kitty.

564
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:22,514
I will tell you nothing!

565
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:29,188
. . .but inside, granite!

566
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:32,357
We can't get anything else
out of him.

567
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:35,235
We pumped a few things
from his stomach.

568
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:36,445
Pretty standard:

569
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:39,364
Grenade, pick,
dynamite, squeaky mouse...

570
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:40,532
...and this.

571
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:44,411
"This is where you are to
enact my fiendish plan.

572
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,998
Eat this after you read it
so no one will find it."

573
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,876
Look here. A Christmas tree.

574
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:54,004
Research is trying to place it.

575
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:55,339
Ring any bells?

576
00:45:58,133 --> 00:45:59,218
What's next?

577
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:02,471
You heard her, boys.
Focus on the mission.

578
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,600
- Full spread scans every 20 minutes.
- Roger that.

579
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,770
- Sam, trim your bangs.
- Sorry.

580
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:11,897
Kid, keep up the good work.

581
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:14,566
Remember to stay away from the boy.

582
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:16,568
Keep your eye on the ball.

583
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:20,239
Come on! Where's the ball?
Bring me the ball!

584
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:23,867
Come on, bring me the ball.

585
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:25,827
Where's the ball?

586
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:27,496
Come on, Lou.

587
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:29,623
Bring me the ball, Lou!

588
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:45,264
I have it now!
You can't get it from me!

589
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,452
How do you always find me?
Tell me.

590
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:08,829
Let's hear it.

591
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:12,541
Belly rub!

592
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:20,090
I'll race you across the yard!

593
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:21,884
What? Too slow?

594
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:26,471
Come on! You can't catch me!
Try and get it.

595
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:29,808
Oh, no!

596
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:06,136
No, Lou!

597
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:22,361
Negative. Non-reactive.

598
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:26,073
Serum sample 1-5-4-3...

599
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:28,742
...negative. Non-reactive.

600
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:29,993
My work.

601
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:34,831
It was an accident. I was playing
with the dog-- The door was open!

602
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,376
Then I was just playing. . . .

603
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:39,711
I didn't mean to.

604
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,715
- I'm so sorry.
- You should just go to school.

605
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:48,136
Sample 1-5-4-6, negative.
Non-reactive.

606
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:49,888
Butch will kill me.

607
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:54,893
1-5-4-7, negative.
Non-reactive.

608
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:58,647
Serum sample 1-5-4-8...

609
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:02,234
...negative. Non-reactive.

610
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:06,321
Serum sample 1-5-4-9...

611
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:09,700
...positive. Pro-reactive.

612
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:15,289
Molecular structure resolved.
Allergy formula complete.

613
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,268
I did it.

614
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:38,437
We did it.

615
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:40,314
We did it.

616
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:48,447
Hi, doctor. The cure for dog allergies?
Success. Done.

617
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:51,742
Fantastic. Send it to me
and we'll verify it.

618
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,286
Tomorrow morning, then.
Bless you.

619
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:56,163
Unacceptable.

620
00:49:56,371 --> 00:49:59,791
We must act immediately
or it will be out of reach.

621
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:03,212
Oh, who? Me?

622
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,631
Were you not paying attention?

623
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,634
- Not really. Are you mad?
- Yes! I am mad!

624
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:10,344
You imbecile bug. . . .

625
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:11,845
Mr. Tinkles!

626
00:50:15,307 --> 00:50:18,185
Guess what I made for you!

627
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:26,693
Now you can look just like me.

628
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:31,281
No, I think not, Sophie.
Those days are through.

629
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,701
What's the matter, Large Marge?

630
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:36,620
Cat got your tongue?

631
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:42,167
Scary, isn't it?

632
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:49,925
Lock her in the closet.
Remain on schedule.

633
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:51,760
Our day has come!

634
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:00,519
Brake!

635
00:51:04,815 --> 00:51:05,774
Gas!

636
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:09,236
Brake!

637
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:23,250
Mr. Mason.
What a surprise, sir.

638
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:27,504
Good morning, human guard.
Let us in. That is all.

639
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,131
Of course, sir.

640
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:33,468
Get off the brake!

641
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:41,810
Brake!

642
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:44,688
Brake! Hit the brake!

643
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:46,982
Gas!

644
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:48,692
Get out of the road!

645
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:50,402
Brake!

646
00:51:50,652 --> 00:51:52,613
- Gas!
- What are you doing?

647
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:56,992
- Brake!
- Can't you drive, you imbecile?

648
00:51:57,242 --> 00:51:58,702
Don't make me come up--

649
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:00,746
Where'd you get licensed?

650
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:04,541
Hello. Out of my way.

651
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:08,212
Attention, employees.

652
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:12,341
Work quickly.
Only seven months until Christmas.

653
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,968
- Mr. Mason!
- Move. Back to work.

654
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:16,720
- Sir.
- Get a life.

655
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,264
Out of my way.
No lunch for you.

656
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:20,432
Mr. Mason!

657
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:22,434
- Morning, sir.
- Nice hat.

658
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:24,561
- How you feeling?
- Move.

659
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:26,688
- Hello, sir.
- That's me.

660
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:30,275
Not an evil cat bent on
taking over the world.

661
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:31,985
Out of my way.

662
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:36,198
Factory employees, congratulations.

663
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:40,536
This factory has been
accident-free for 45 minutes.

664
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:53,507
Sir! Mr. Mason.

665
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:56,802
- Sir.
- Get the door.

666
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:04,142
Nice dress.

667
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,773
- Can I get you anything?
- Sushi and cream.

668
00:53:09,982 --> 00:53:11,400
Close the door.

669
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,779
Attention.

670
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:18,949
Attention, human workers.

671
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:20,993
This is your employer...

672
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:22,202
. . .Mr. Mason.

673
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:25,664
Effective immediately,
you are all fired.

674
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:27,833
That's right. Fired!

675
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,752
Go home now. Do not ask why.

676
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:32,838
You are to blame.

677
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:35,591
Unless you have a dog.
Then blame him.

678
00:53:36,717 --> 00:53:39,303
In fact, kick him when you get home.

679
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:40,679
That is all.

680
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:44,224
Cats rule.

681
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:46,852
Now, the next phase of my plan.

682
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:57,863
Scotty?

683
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:00,157
I have a package for you.

684
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:08,916
Wait. Where'd she go?
In or out? In or out?

685
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:10,834
Honey, honey.

686
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:15,214
You'll never believe this.
A breakthrough.

687
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:18,300
I am hours away from--

688
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:21,261
Mom, Dad! Check it out!

689
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,388
Tickets to a game tonight.

690
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:27,392
- What?
- That is so great.

691
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:29,394
Uruguay versus Chad.

692
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,605
You never entered a contest.

693
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:34,316
Can we go? Please?
Please, can we go?

694
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,028
Me?

695
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:43,075
Please, I really want to go. Come on.

696
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:49,248
Hurry, buckle up!
We don't want to be late!

697
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:51,792
Okay. Hey, I know.

698
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:56,171
- The birds have left the nest.
- Go again.

699
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,841
The jelly is out of the doughnut.

700
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:02,427
- What are you saying?
- The family has gone.

701
00:55:03,053 --> 00:55:04,680
Hey, Lou.

702
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,934
It's you. Where have you been?

703
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:10,227
Around.

704
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:13,981
This week's been amazing.
I got to beat up a kitten.

705
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:15,399
I'm on wet food.

706
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:19,486
- And Scott says I'm his best friend.
- Terrific.

707
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:21,113
Don't tell anyone.

708
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,783
Butch wouldn't like it.
He gets mad.

709
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:27,828
Yeah, I know. But he's not mad.

710
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:30,998
Sometimes mad is
a way of hiding. . .

711
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:35,294
- . . .how sad you are.
- What? Why would he be sad?

712
00:55:37,754 --> 00:55:42,217
It's not my place to say.
But a person really hurt him once.

713
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,971
Poor Butch.

714
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:52,311
Here we are.
I said I'd get us here.

715
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:56,773
I hope Mbuto plays.
He's the best one-legged forward ever.

716
00:55:56,982 --> 00:56:01,153
- Is this the right place?
- Where are all the tailgaters?

717
00:56:04,323 --> 00:56:06,950
Are we early? Nobody around.

718
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:10,245
That'll make us first in line
for chili dogs.

719
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,249
Chili dog! Chili dog!

720
00:56:14,499 --> 00:56:16,418
How much do I owe you?

721
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:17,836
I'm sorry. Didn't catch it.

722
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:21,965
- Hello.
- No charge!

723
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:25,886
- What?
- What is it?

724
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:28,347
- Oh, my God!
- Take it back.

725
00:56:47,366 --> 00:56:49,743
Cats rule, cats rule

726
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:53,038
Oh, yeah, we kick butt

727
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:03,924
Kid.

728
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:05,801
Lou!

729
00:57:07,177 --> 00:57:08,470
Butch.

730
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:09,972
What's up?

731
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,976
Professor's done,
I filed my report and. . . .

732
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:16,019
Kid. . .

733
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:18,230
. . .they're impressed.

734
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:21,483
They wanted me to give you this.

735
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:27,114
But this is for. . . .

736
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:30,826
When this job's over,
you've a spot at the academy.

737
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:33,537
You pulled it off, kid.
Good work.

738
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:36,582
I get to be a real agent like you?

739
00:57:36,874 --> 00:57:38,083
Well, you can try.

740
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,586
- Partners!
- Don't wet the paper yet.

741
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:44,590
But if you make it,
think of all the places you'll see.

742
00:57:45,382 --> 00:57:48,552
Maybe Burma. Yeah.

743
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:51,263
Or Denmark. What was her name?

744
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:53,682
Or Pasadena.

745
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,936
Wait. So I wouldn't stay here.

746
00:57:58,103 --> 00:58:00,355
You go where they need you.

747
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:03,901
- Bogey in the wire.

748
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:07,654
It's a calico.
Should I take him?

749
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:10,240
Negative. Me and the kid got it.

750
00:58:10,616 --> 00:58:11,575
Yeah!

751
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:16,288
My last job. Deliver this tape,
and I'm off to Jamaica.

752
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:27,799
- What's this?
- Get off me.

753
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:30,219
All right, you got me.

754
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:33,388
Stop. Please don't pull
on the duct tape!

755
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,058
Hello. Is this on?

756
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:39,311
Closer! Turn it over!
Where did you come from?

757
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,148
Hello, my puny-minded
dog-faced opponents.

758
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:45,234
What? Yes, it's on.

759
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:47,319
The red light's blinking.

760
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:55,202
I'm sure you've wondered...

761
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:58,997
...about the identity of
who will defeat you.

762
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:02,501
Who it is that possesses
the intellect to win...

763
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:05,254
...in this chess game
of wits and might.

764
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,506
It is I!

765
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:10,342
Recognize these humans?

766
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:14,054
If you want to see them
alive again...

767
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:16,932
...bring the formula
and all notes...

768
00:59:17,182 --> 00:59:22,312
...regarding Brody's research
to the Ninth Street Pier at midnight.

769
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:26,692
If you refuse, well, they
will be put to sleep!

770
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:30,279
Hold that still!

771
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:33,031
You have until midnight to comply.

772
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:38,704
- We're gonna save them, right?
- This is over our heads.

773
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:50,132
- You calling headquarters?
- No, we're going there.

774
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:52,885
Now we can push the big button.
Hang on.

775
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:56,722
- Nav systems.
- Check.

776
00:59:57,598 --> 00:59:59,433
- GPS.
- Check.

777
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:02,436
Raising anchors. We 're go for launch.

778
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,980
Hold onto your tail, kid!

779
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:14,573
Velocity at 625 feet per second.

780
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:18,160
You are clear for EVA.

781
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,794
Canine transport
loading at platform two.

782
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:31,465
282nd Airborne Chihuahuas,
report to the briefing room.

783
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:35,260
This is it, kid. Welcome to HQ.

784
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:36,929
Roll over!

785
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,140
Roll over! Sit!

786
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:44,269
Spaying and neutering
reversal procedures on level three.

787
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,700
- For defensive purposes, of course.
- Oh.

788
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:00,452
Of course.

789
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:03,664
Personnel are required
to curb themselves.

790
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:06,041
Remember to scoop your poop.

791
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,876
Testing, testing.

792
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:10,754
You've reached headquarters.
Log in.

793
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:12,840
Tiger, what are you doing?

794
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:15,467
Bad dog!

795
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:21,014
Recognize these humans?

796
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:25,143
If you want to see them again,
bring the formula...

797
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:29,189
...and all notes
regarding Brody's research...

798
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:34,152
... to the Ninth Street Pier
at midnight. If you refuse...

799
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,072
... they will be put to sleep.

800
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:39,324
Assemble the delegates.

801
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:55,465
Order! Order, please.

802
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,593
Delagates, please! Order!

803
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:05,559
We cannot give up the formula.
Sacrifice the Brody family.

804
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:09,938
Nein! Lives are at stake.
We cannot deem them expendable.

805
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:13,317
Delegates, please! Order!

806
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:15,110
I must have order!

807
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:17,196
Please, no Frisbee!

808
01:02:19,698 --> 01:02:21,825
Steve, crowd control.

809
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,460
Sit!

810
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:35,547
Now then, delegates.
It's time to vote.

811
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:38,091
Wait! Can I say something first?

812
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:39,760
Kid, quiet!

813
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:43,639
I was told it was an agent's job
to protect people.

814
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:49,895
Delegates, it's time.
Family or formula.

815
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:51,688
No! Wait. Wait!

816
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:53,440
Just minutes ago...

817
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:57,861
... the Council voted to
sacrifice the family...

818
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:02,908
... to safeguard humanity against
the cat threat forever.

819
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:06,662
For Canine News Network,
this is Wolf Blitzer.

820
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:08,830
Poor kid.

821
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:11,208
I need some equipment, guys.

822
01:03:18,257 --> 01:03:20,259
- Hold on a second, kid.
- No!

823
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:22,761
- Hold it.
- They can't do this.

824
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:26,723
- You should've fought for me!
- What good would it do?

825
01:03:26,932 --> 01:03:29,977
"Man's best friend."
History 1 01 , remember?

826
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:33,313
Here's lesson two.
We protect and work for them.

827
01:03:33,522 --> 01:03:36,608
We tolerate that stupid
baby-talk crap.

828
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:38,527
Then they go to college. . .

829
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:42,614
. . .and dump you with an old lady
who can't throw a ball!

830
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,455
You blame my family for what
some boy did to you?

831
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:57,546
Look, kid. I'm sorry it
played out like this. . .

832
01:03:57,796 --> 01:04:00,299
. . .but it's over. We're shut down.

833
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:06,930
Don't be scared, Scotty.
Everything will be okay.

834
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:08,724
I'm not scared, Mom.

835
01:04:08,974 --> 01:04:11,518
It's all right. Only natural.

836
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:14,771
- We'll be okay.
- Mom, really, I'm okay.

837
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,274
You're trying to be brave.

838
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:18,734
- It's okay.
- Mom--

839
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:20,694
Scotty, don't be scared!

840
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:24,573
- I am your rock!
- Please.

841
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,868
Who kidnapped us,
Uruguay or Chad?

842
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:30,537
I heard what happened.
How's Lou?

843
01:04:30,746 --> 01:04:34,208
- I told him not to get attached.
- "An agent focuses. . .

844
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:36,210
. . .only on the mission.

845
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:40,547
- That's why my family didn't love me."
- We all have sob stories.

846
01:04:40,756 --> 01:04:42,508
Now he has his.

847
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:13,080
- I have to go.
- I said go before we left.

848
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:24,049
So you brought the research.

849
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:26,510
Foolish puppy.

850
01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:37,729
He took the research.

851
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:44,069
Lou.

852
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:45,988
Butch, are you there?

853
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,740
Lou's in trouble at the pier!

854
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,701
Dock 14. Hurry!

855
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:52,244
Lou!

856
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:35,746
I thought they would let my family go.

857
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:51,136
How many dogs does it take
to overthrow mankind?

858
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:53,764
Just one stupid puppy.

859
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:55,641
Where is my family?!

860
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:57,184
Oh, they're alive.

861
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:58,435
For now.

862
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:00,812
But it won't matter--

863
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:04,691
This isn't NASCAR!

864
01:07:05,776 --> 01:07:07,402
I've seized the formula. . .

865
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:09,863
. . .and in hours, I'll reverse it. . .

866
01:07:10,072 --> 01:07:10,822
. . .giving me. . .

867
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:12,658
... the power to make humans...

868
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:22,376
How can I gloat gleefully
when you drive like a chimpanzee?!

869
01:07:22,835 --> 01:07:27,506
I will make all of humanity
violently allergic to your kind.

870
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:31,009
And when you're all despised
by those you protect...

871
01:07:31,218 --> 01:07:33,971
... you will be cast out,
leaving me to lead...

872
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:36,431
. . .cats in a glorious revolution. . .

873
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,392
... to conquer the world!

874
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:41,395
- What will we do?
- "We"?

875
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:46,066
You doomed the human race forever.
There's nothing to do.

876
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:49,278
You always give up too easy, Butch.

877
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:53,615
- Is that what I think it is?
- What, Butch?

878
01:07:53,824 --> 01:07:56,243
Yup, it's the Cat Tracker 2000.

879
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:02,499
Those fleabags must be
running for the hills.

880
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,918
That's what I was thinking.

881
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:10,007
Faster. I thought you were union!

882
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:12,676
I got a bonus for the guy....

883
01:08:25,063 --> 01:08:28,108
That's it.
The Christmas tree from the note.

884
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:34,281
What the heck are they up to?

885
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:40,913
All those mice can feed an army.

886
01:08:46,877 --> 01:08:49,630
- Hello, Professor Brody.
- Who are you?

887
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:52,549
Sorry about the wait. . .

888
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:55,511
- . . .but we had tests to run.
- Who's that?

889
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:57,137
Who are you?

890
01:08:57,387 --> 01:08:59,264
Is this about my work?

891
01:09:00,516 --> 01:09:02,184
You're from one of those. . .

892
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:06,021
. . .big multinational,
corporate, profit-mongering. . .

893
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:08,732
. . .pharmaceutical companies
stealing--

894
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:10,943
Pharmaceutical company?

895
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:13,445
You misunderstand me.

896
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:15,405
What's going on? Hello?

897
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:18,909
That smell.
A feline essence--

898
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:25,499
Where are you?

899
01:09:28,418 --> 01:09:31,004
Show yourself.
You can't hide forever.

900
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:36,051
But I've nothing to hide.

901
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:45,143
Cool!

902
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:58,740
Will someone please shut her up?!

903
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:03,745
I have an ingenious test to perform.

904
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:07,165
Are you mutants?
I read this comic book--

905
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:09,084
"I read a comic book."

906
01:10:09,293 --> 01:10:11,545
You make me sick!

907
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:16,592
Calm down, honey. Calm down.

908
01:10:16,842 --> 01:10:20,262
It's an experiment gone awry.
You're turning blue!

909
01:10:22,764 --> 01:10:24,474
It's about time.

910
01:10:27,019 --> 01:10:28,520
My captive audience. . .

911
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:33,317
. . .shall we play a little game,
young Brody? Excuse me.

912
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:35,944
The vial! The green one!

913
01:10:36,153 --> 01:10:37,279
Here, boss.

914
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,325
Oh, hello, Mr. Sinister Serum.

915
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:43,160
- What's in that?
- Well. . .

916
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:46,288
. . .my quote-unquote master's
fake snow. . .

917
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:49,249
. . .is the perfect medium
for carrying. . .

918
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:50,876
. . .your disease.

919
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:54,546
Ah, yes. Thereby. . .

920
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:58,008
. . .breaking the bond between a boy
and his dog.

921
01:10:58,217 --> 01:10:59,134
No, wait.

922
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:03,055
Scat.

923
01:11:03,722 --> 01:11:05,265
Lower the cage!

924
01:11:14,775 --> 01:11:15,943
Success! You!

925
01:11:16,235 --> 01:11:19,279
- Go assemble the troops.
- Yes, sir.

926
01:11:23,075 --> 01:11:26,537
As for you, Brody herd. . .

927
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:28,330
. . .I have a very. . .

928
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,499
. . .very special. . .

929
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,584
. . .gift! What?!

930
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:35,796
I said buy a real gun!

931
01:11:36,088 --> 01:11:41,051
- That's what I was thinking.
- What use can I have for this?!

932
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:52,396
Hey! I'm so clever.

933
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:56,400
This here is just plain fun.

934
01:11:58,026 --> 01:11:59,736
- Stay here.
- Why?

935
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:01,446
Because I hate you.

936
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:05,868
No! Help! Let me out!

937
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:08,495
In just hours. . .

938
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:12,875
. . .every human in the world
will be allergic to dogs.

939
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:17,337
But such a mammoth plot
requires brothers-in-arms.

940
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:19,131
And this. . .

941
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:22,926
. . .is where my genius
truly comes to pass.

942
01:12:23,177 --> 01:12:28,265
For I have chosen a comrade that can
invade every home in the world.

943
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:35,230
Mice!

944
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:37,691
Son of my mom!

945
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,819
Mice! The unlikeliest of allies.

946
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:45,782
You're all asking:

947
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:49,411
"How can he spread the allergy
to the world?"

948
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:54,374
Open your World Domination pamphlets
and I'll show you.

949
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:00,631
Enter the sewers and with the maps
in appendix B. . .

950
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:03,967
. . .you'll cross the nation.
Half go to homes. . .

951
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:06,720
. . .infecting every human,
while the rest--

952
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:08,597
Turn the page.

953
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:12,267
- -will stow away
on planes and boats. . .

954
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:15,521
. . .to infect the world.
With the dogs gone. . .

955
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:20,400
. . .cats will overthrow the humans
and you'll be given your reward:

956
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:23,570
1 6 pounds of Monterey Jack. . .

957
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,907
. . .and the continent of Australia!

958
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:30,702
- Australia!
- Yeah!

959
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:32,538
Open the sewer hatch!

960
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:39,753
Okay, here's the plan.

961
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:49,805
Flee across the world!

962
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:51,932
Go forth and infect everyone!

963
01:13:52,391 --> 01:13:54,309
Be all you can be!

964
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,396
My plan has come full circle!

965
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:00,107
You have nothing to fear but
mousetraps. . .

966
01:14:04,403 --> 01:14:05,654
He ate Gary!

967
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:07,322
Run!

968
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:10,242
What's that?

969
01:14:17,624 --> 01:14:19,168
It's over, Tinkles!

970
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:20,919
Dogs. Where are they?

971
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:25,674
Lou, the hatch. Close the hatch.

972
01:14:27,509 --> 01:14:28,927
Bath time!

973
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:32,097
Surrender, you're finished!

974
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:34,474
Let's go!

975
01:14:34,975 --> 01:14:36,685
I have a plane to catch.

976
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:55,454
Ivy's, go find Peek and Sam.
I've got to find Lou.

977
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:03,128
Good boy.

978
01:15:05,631 --> 01:15:07,216
Hey! Stop!

979
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:09,343
Stop. I need to crush you.

980
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:11,178
I'll get you.

981
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:15,557
How did you find us?

982
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:19,019
- Come on, we have to go.
- Can you talk too?

983
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:24,650
I'll scratch that for you!

984
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:29,321
I'll squeeze you like a tick!

985
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:35,077
Come on, honey!

986
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,164
Come here.
I got a Milk-Bone for you.

987
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:43,585
I've got you now.

988
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:50,551
- Put me down, hairball!
- I just want a hug!

989
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:56,014
I'm coming, Butch!

990
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:02,354
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

991
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:05,274
You're too late, puppy.

992
01:16:07,276 --> 01:16:08,360
I'm king of the world!

993
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:09,528
Get him, Lou!

994
01:16:10,028 --> 01:16:12,698
I give up. Please don't hurt me.

995
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:15,784
Get your butt off my face,
Tinkles!

996
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:29,590
Now, where was I? Oh, yes.

997
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,347
Now the final crushing.

998
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:54,031
Dogs rule!

999
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:57,659
This is a minor setback.

1000
01:16:58,577 --> 01:17:00,787
You're finished, Fluffy!

1001
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:04,833
Butch! We did it!

1002
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:23,352
- Come on, Scotty!
- Come on! Quickly!

1003
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:30,692
Come on!

1004
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,248
Wait. Where's Lou?!

1005
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,173
Kid, we did it.

1006
01:18:34,339 --> 01:18:37,467
We saved them like you said.
You were right.

1007
01:18:37,676 --> 01:18:39,678
And you were right about me.

1008
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:40,804
Kid?

1009
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:46,185
Oh, no.

1010
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:15,214
Come on, Lou, wake up.

1011
01:19:17,382 --> 01:19:19,426
You're not a loser, Lou.

1012
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:26,517
Wake up.

1013
01:19:41,573 --> 01:19:44,201
Mom, Dad, he's alive!

1014
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,746
Mom, Dad, he's alive!

1015
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:49,331
Come quick!

1016
01:19:50,582 --> 01:19:51,708
He came back!

1017
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:54,962
- You have the right to--
- You have the right. . .

1018
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:58,799
- . . .to remain silent.
- Anything you say can be used. . . .

1019
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:00,801
Oh, my God!

1020
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:03,136
And the right to a dog attorney.

1021
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:10,894
Get it, Lou! Come on!

1022
01:20:11,103 --> 01:20:12,896
Nice! You're getting good.

1023
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:16,191
Put your head forward.

1024
01:20:19,653 --> 01:20:20,946
All right, Dad!

1025
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:24,074
- Lou, go get it.
- That's a triple.

1026
01:20:24,283 --> 01:20:25,659
Hey, kid.

1027
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:28,120
Everything go okay at HQ?

1028
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:31,206
They're eating out of my paw.
How's things?

1029
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:36,003
- Great. Want to play some ball?
- No, I gotta get back to work.

1030
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:40,090
Bring it here. Find the ball.

1031
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:47,472
Come on! Go get it! Come on!

1032
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:49,600
He's got it! He's got it!

1033
01:20:49,808 --> 01:20:53,437
Bring that ball!
Bring that ball back!

1034
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:57,316
He would've made a great agent.

1035
01:21:02,946 --> 01:21:08,035
That's right, Mr. Tinkles.
You have been a very bad kitty.

1036
01:21:08,285 --> 01:21:11,955
I'm just going to have to
teach you how to behave.

1037
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:18,337
Now you're going to have to live
with me and my sisters!

1038
01:21:19,463 --> 01:21:21,340
Mr. Tinkles!

1039
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:29,848
Look what we made for you!

1040
01:21:37,856 --> 01:21:41,360
- I could eat you with a spoon!
- I can't take it!
