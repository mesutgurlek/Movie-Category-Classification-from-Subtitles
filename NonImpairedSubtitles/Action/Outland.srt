1
01:53:08,474 --> 01:53:12,865
No way they're going to bring
those automated vacuum loaders here.

2
01:53:13,994 --> 01:53:18,385
When they installed them on 1 4 and 23,
they said it was a temporary experiment.

3
01:53:19,474 --> 01:53:22,272
Well, they're still there.
Some temporary!

4
01:53:22,874 --> 01:53:25,069
Hand me that coupler, would you?

5
01:53:27,114 --> 01:53:30,470
What about Wooton?
He's a shop steward. What'd he say?

6
01:53:31,114 --> 01:53:32,752
I'll tell you what Wooton said.

7
01:53:33,354 --> 01:53:35,151
Zip. That's what he said.

8
01:53:35,994 --> 01:53:38,030
They're always trying to pull something.

9
01:53:38,874 --> 01:53:40,307
That's a lot of crap!

10
01:53:40,594 --> 01:53:44,906
They've run a 7 worker shift since they
installed those loaders on 1 4 and 23.

11
01:53:45,754 --> 01:53:48,905
Hey, you read the contract.
8 workers per shift.

12
01:53:49,194 --> 01:53:52,425
That's what it says. Eight.
In black and white.

13
01:53:52,794 --> 01:53:55,354
So they want to get cute,
I can get cute, too.

14
01:53:55,914 --> 01:53:58,553
I want a meeting.
Maybe we need a new shop steward.

15
01:53:58,874 --> 01:54:02,344
Bylaws are bylaws.
Can't they regulate these suits?

16
01:54:02,634 --> 01:54:03,908
It's minus 1 75 degrees.

17
01:54:04,194 --> 01:54:05,673
We broil our asses off.

18
01:54:05,954 --> 01:54:08,309
-Where's your other suit?
-In the shop.

19
01:54:08,714 --> 01:54:10,625
Put some Mylar over the sensor.

20
01:54:10,914 --> 01:54:13,906
It steps down the heating coil
and you'll be cooler.

21
01:54:14,434 --> 01:54:15,264
Really?

22
01:54:15,554 --> 01:54:16,828
No, moron, I made it up.

23
01:54:17,874 --> 01:54:19,148
Oh, God!

24
01:54:20,794 --> 01:54:22,022
I hate spiders!

25
01:54:22,954 --> 01:54:23,784
Kill it!

26
01:54:25,034 --> 01:54:26,183
Kill it!

27
01:54:26,594 --> 01:54:28,425
Hey, Tarlow, what's eating you?

28
01:54:28,714 --> 01:54:30,989
Get it off! Get it off my leg!

29
01:54:31,514 --> 01:54:33,630
Somebody please help me!

30
01:54:34,674 --> 01:54:38,189
Tarlow, what's the matter with you?
Get what off?

31
01:54:38,594 --> 01:54:42,382
Spider! Please help me! Get it off!

32
01:54:44,514 --> 01:54:47,153
Spider? Have you popped your cork?

33
01:54:47,674 --> 01:54:51,064
How can there be a spider here?
There's nothing alive here.

34
01:54:52,234 --> 01:54:55,146
Get it off! Oh, get it off! Oh, God!

35
01:54:55,594 --> 01:54:56,743
Very funny.

36
01:54:57,114 --> 01:55:01,426
We're not falling for nothing.
Cut the garbage and get back to work.

37
01:55:02,234 --> 01:55:04,111
Oh, God, it's getting inside!

38
01:55:04,674 --> 01:55:06,551
Get it out! Get it out!

39
01:55:06,834 --> 01:55:08,904
Somebody please help me!

40
01:55:09,354 --> 01:55:11,788
Somebody help me get it out of my suit!

41
01:55:32,234 --> 01:55:33,462
Is it the buttermilk kind?

42
01:55:33,834 --> 01:55:35,062
I'm afraid so.

43
01:55:35,754 --> 01:55:37,870
They were running out of the other kind.

44
01:55:38,154 --> 01:55:39,985
I can hardly talk with these braces.

45
01:55:40,274 --> 01:55:41,707
It won't be much longer.

46
01:55:41,994 --> 01:55:43,746
-How much longer?
-Pretty soon.

47
01:55:44,034 --> 01:55:45,228
How soon?

48
01:55:45,514 --> 01:55:48,153
-How soon for what?
-Till I get my braces off.

49
01:55:49,594 --> 01:55:52,427
-You want crooked teeth?
-I don't mind them.

50
01:55:52,794 --> 01:55:56,423
You'll be missing some teeth
in a minute if you don't eat breakfast.

51
01:56:00,954 --> 01:56:02,307
Pretend it's not buttermilk.

52
01:56:02,594 --> 01:56:03,709
Pretend I ate them.

53
01:56:10,434 --> 01:56:13,153
Marshal, it's Lowell.
The night watch went okay.

54
01:56:13,634 --> 01:56:15,670
Nothing much.
Just a couple of drunks.

55
01:56:15,954 --> 01:56:17,512
We'll watch it tonight.

56
01:56:18,074 --> 01:56:21,146
That's it.
I'll be in your office at 18:00.

57
01:56:21,594 --> 01:56:24,427
Marshal, it's Montone.
Nothing more on that incident...

58
01:56:24,714 --> 01:56:27,069
...in the mine yesterday.
Some guy went whacko.

59
01:56:27,474 --> 01:56:31,831
The Company's shipping the body back,
or what's left, on today's shuttle.

60
01:56:32,114 --> 01:56:35,345
It's impossible to do an autopsy.
You should have seen that mess!

61
01:56:35,994 --> 01:56:38,827
Anyway, definitely no homicide.

62
01:56:39,594 --> 01:56:41,585
There were two witnesses
when it happened.

63
01:56:41,874 --> 01:56:44,069
It happens every once
in a while up here.

64
01:56:44,354 --> 01:56:46,424
Some people let this place get to them.

65
01:56:46,954 --> 01:56:48,831
So, that's about it.

66
01:56:49,674 --> 01:56:53,189
Tell your wife that Transportation
got the tickets for her.

67
01:56:53,474 --> 01:56:55,385
I'll see you
when you get to the office.

68
01:56:55,674 --> 01:56:58,142
And don 't worry,
you'll get used to it.

69
01:57:05,274 --> 01:57:06,673
What tickets?

70
01:57:07,034 --> 01:57:10,151
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds,
the nice couple from the bakery.

71
01:57:10,434 --> 01:57:13,665
They wanted tickets
for the weekly shuttle for a friend.

72
01:57:13,954 --> 01:57:15,910
So I said I'd see what I could do.

73
01:57:16,194 --> 01:57:18,913
Well, I'd better go.
See you for dinner, sport.

74
01:57:21,194 --> 01:57:24,709
-And remember, 7 pages of math.
-I promise.

75
01:57:24,994 --> 01:57:27,383
-You be good today.
-I will.

76
01:57:35,714 --> 01:57:38,103
Look, I know this is a lousy assignment.

77
01:57:38,394 --> 01:57:41,147
And I know what it is for you.
How difficult.

78
01:57:42,594 --> 01:57:45,154
Just give it a chance.
It won't be so bad.

79
01:57:45,434 --> 01:57:46,469
I know.

80
01:57:53,274 --> 01:57:54,468
I love you.

81
01:57:57,674 --> 01:57:59,073
I love you, too.

82
01:58:00,994 --> 01:58:05,146
We've only been here two weeks.
It'll get better. I promise.

83
01:58:07,274 --> 01:58:09,629
l got to go.
You smell good.

84
01:59:32,434 --> 01:59:36,552
And finally,
I realize that I'm new here. . .

85
01:59:37,434 --> 01:59:41,791
. . .and I've got to get to know you,
and you've got to get to know me.

86
01:59:43,114 --> 01:59:47,426
I just hope that I can
justify your confidence.

87
01:59:50,874 --> 01:59:51,989
Thank you.

88
01:59:52,274 --> 01:59:54,947
-I really wowed them.
-Had them eating out of your hand.

89
01:59:55,234 --> 01:59:56,826
Are there any questions?

90
01:59:58,554 --> 01:59:59,703
Marshal?

91
02:00:00,994 --> 02:00:01,870
Flo Spector. . .

92
02:00:02,234 --> 02:00:03,633
. . .Accounting Services.

93
02:00:03,914 --> 02:00:05,711
I'm sure I speak for all of us. . .

94
02:00:05,994 --> 02:00:09,145
. . .in extending our welcome
to you and your family.

95
02:00:09,434 --> 02:00:12,983
If Mrs. O'Niel or your son should need
anything, tell them to call me.

96
02:00:13,834 --> 02:00:14,983
Thank you very much.

97
02:00:15,274 --> 02:00:18,789
I'll be sure and tell my wife.
Her name is Carol.

98
02:00:20,154 --> 02:00:22,270
I see there are no more questions.

99
02:00:22,554 --> 02:00:24,749
I add my welcome to Marshal O'Niel.

100
02:00:25,274 --> 02:00:27,583
I'm sure we all agree
he'll have a pleasant tour.

101
02:00:27,874 --> 02:00:29,990
Right now,
he's just getting started here.

102
02:00:30,274 --> 02:00:33,152
Soon he'll see that this
is like every other mining town.

103
02:00:33,434 --> 02:00:36,232
-There's never much trouble.
-I'm glad to hear it.

104
02:00:37,514 --> 02:00:41,302
Just remember that these men
and women work hard. Very hard.

105
02:00:42,154 --> 02:00:47,023
Since I've been the general manager,
we've broken all productivity records.

106
02:00:47,674 --> 02:00:50,142
We're becoming the leading
Con-Amalgamate operation.

107
02:00:50,754 --> 02:00:54,144
And everyone in this room has
received the bonus checks to prove it.

108
02:00:54,434 --> 02:00:56,709
Good work only comes
from contented people.

109
02:00:56,994 --> 02:00:58,905
I work these people hard. . .

110
02:00:59,194 --> 02:01:02,152
. . .and I let them play hard.

111
02:01:02,634 --> 02:01:05,546
When it comes time
for them to let off steam. . .

112
02:01:05,834 --> 02:01:07,950
. . .you have to allow them some room.

113
02:01:09,034 --> 02:01:11,787
Long as no harm's done,
just give them a little room.

114
02:01:13,114 --> 02:01:15,674
Understand what I'm saying, Marshal?

115
02:01:17,554 --> 02:01:19,510
Thanks for the advice, Mr. Sheppard.

116
02:01:20,234 --> 02:01:21,587
We're all professionals.

117
02:01:22,834 --> 02:01:24,108
I'm sure we are.

118
02:01:25,234 --> 02:01:26,189
Drop by my office.

119
02:01:26,954 --> 02:01:28,182
We'll talk some more.

120
02:01:29,274 --> 02:01:30,468
I'll do that.

121
02:01:33,834 --> 02:01:36,064
Don't get your nose out of joint.

122
02:01:36,354 --> 02:01:37,787
What was that all about?

123
02:01:38,154 --> 02:01:40,907
-It's just his way.
-I don't like his way.

124
02:01:41,194 --> 02:01:42,912
-Don't mess with him.
-He's an asshole.

125
02:01:43,274 --> 02:01:45,265
A very powerful asshole.
Don't mess with him.

126
02:01:45,594 --> 02:01:47,391
He's just trying to sniff you out.

127
02:01:47,674 --> 02:01:51,508
The last marshal kept things
running smooth. That's all they want.

128
02:01:52,154 --> 02:01:54,304
Things run smooth,
they make their money.

129
02:01:54,594 --> 02:01:58,667
Nobody's here for their health, and they
certainly aren't here for the scenery.

130
02:03:26,514 --> 02:03:27,867
What is that guy doing?

131
02:03:31,954 --> 02:03:33,228
He's going in the elevator!

132
02:03:37,314 --> 02:03:39,748
He's going in the elevator
without a suit on!

133
02:05:20,034 --> 02:05:21,183
Carol?

134
02:05:24,834 --> 02:05:27,143
I'm trying to keep my composure.

135
02:05:27,434 --> 02:05:30,585
And like everything I do,
I think I'm messing this up.

136
02:05:31,954 --> 02:05:35,629
I despise these message things.
I'm just such a coward.

137
02:05:37,674 --> 02:05:41,906
I couldn 't look at your face and say
what I'm about to say. I just couldn 't.

138
02:05:42,994 --> 02:05:46,066
If you were in front of me,
I'd change my mind.

139
02:05:47,834 --> 02:05:49,711
And I don 't want to change my mind.

140
02:05:50,834 --> 02:05:53,667
I love you.
Please know that.

141
02:05:54,874 --> 02:05:56,273
I hadn 't planned this.

142
02:05:56,554 --> 02:05:57,464
I really hadn 't.

143
02:06:01,794 --> 02:06:04,706
I just can 't take it anymore.
That's what it amounts to.

144
02:06:05,994 --> 02:06:08,906
I know we've been over this
so many times before.

145
02:06:09,194 --> 02:06:12,584
The same crying from me,
and the same assurances from you.

146
02:06:13,434 --> 02:06:17,950
That the next place will be different.
But it never is. It can 't be.

147
02:06:18,554 --> 02:06:21,990
So yesterday,
something snapped in me.

148
02:06:22,394 --> 02:06:25,033
I just couldn 't bear to see Paulie...

149
02:06:25,434 --> 02:06:29,029
...clatter around yet another
bleak place. I just couldn 't.

150
02:06:30,194 --> 02:06:33,982
He's a child.
He's never set foot on Earth.

151
02:06:34,314 --> 02:06:35,383
Never!

152
02:06:38,034 --> 02:06:40,867
He looks at pictures
and reads books of Earth...

153
02:06:41,154 --> 02:06:45,625
...all day long. And he hides them
from you so your feelings won 't be hurt.

154
02:06:45,954 --> 02:06:48,593
Don 't you see he deserves a childhood?

155
02:06:49,074 --> 02:06:53,192
He deserves a chance
to breathe air, real outside air...

156
02:06:54,034 --> 02:06:56,070
... where you don 't broil or explode.

157
02:06:56,434 --> 02:06:57,992
Air that smells like life!

158
02:06:58,554 --> 02:07:00,863
Not like a ventilating unit!

159
02:07:02,714 --> 02:07:04,306
I'm just not as good as you are.

160
02:07:04,594 --> 02:07:06,471
I don 't think it's worth it.

161
02:07:11,314 --> 02:07:13,464
So I'm taking Paulie back home.

162
02:07:15,954 --> 02:07:17,182
I love you.

163
02:07:18,834 --> 02:07:21,985
You don 't deserve this.
You deserve the best.

164
02:07:24,474 --> 02:07:27,352
I've just got to go now, my love.
I'll contact you...

165
02:07:27,634 --> 02:07:31,547
...in a few days from the space station
before we finally leave for Earth.

166
02:07:47,954 --> 02:07:51,469
What do we have here?
What's happening with the purser's area?

167
02:07:51,754 --> 02:07:54,143
We've put monitors
on the whole area for 36 hours. . .

168
02:07:54,434 --> 02:07:55,913
. . .and things have been quiet.

169
02:07:56,274 --> 02:07:58,185
Keep the monitors on for two weeks.

170
02:08:00,714 --> 02:08:02,625
-And the detonators?
-They were found.

171
02:08:02,914 --> 02:08:03,585
Where?

172
02:08:03,874 --> 02:08:06,069
I don't know.
The foreman reported them found. . .

173
02:08:06,714 --> 02:08:08,705
. . .then told me to forget about it.

174
02:08:09,714 --> 02:08:12,228
Nelson, we're talking about
nuclear detonators.

175
02:08:12,594 --> 02:08:15,313
You just don't lose them
and then find them.

176
02:08:15,594 --> 02:08:17,232
You lose your comb, then find it.

177
02:08:17,514 --> 02:08:18,663
Not detonators.

178
02:08:18,994 --> 02:08:22,430
I want to know where they were found
and who found them. Get it?

179
02:08:25,074 --> 02:08:26,632
Good for you, Nelson.

180
02:08:28,194 --> 02:08:31,266
Slater, what about the incident
in the mine elevator?

181
02:08:31,634 --> 02:08:33,147
Nothing much to tell, Sarge.

182
02:08:33,554 --> 02:08:37,706
Some cupcake named Cane decided
he didn't need an environment suit.

183
02:08:37,994 --> 02:08:40,554
They're still sponging him
off the elevator walls.

184
02:08:40,874 --> 02:08:43,513
He was alone. Nobody near enough
to have thrown him in.

185
02:08:43,794 --> 02:08:45,625
Some guys tried
to get into the airlock. . .

186
02:08:45,914 --> 02:08:47,427
. . .except he'd sealed it.

187
02:08:48,154 --> 02:08:49,507
No way it was homicide.

188
02:08:49,834 --> 02:08:52,473
-Had to have been a suicide.
-Did he leave a note?

189
02:08:54,354 --> 02:08:55,343
I beg your pardon?

190
02:08:55,634 --> 02:08:56,908
Did he leave a note?

191
02:08:57,434 --> 02:08:59,026
None that we know of, sir.

192
02:08:59,394 --> 02:09:01,066
Then how do you know it was suicide?

193
02:09:02,434 --> 02:09:04,106
There's no other explanation.

194
02:09:04,394 --> 02:09:06,589
He knew what he was doing,
that's for sure.

195
02:09:06,874 --> 02:09:10,025
You can't fall into an airlock
and then an elevator.

196
02:09:10,354 --> 02:09:13,630
You have to open hatches,
press buttons, close hatches.

197
02:09:14,154 --> 02:09:15,792
It's the only explanation.

198
02:09:18,634 --> 02:09:19,589
Thank you.

199
02:09:23,474 --> 02:09:25,226
Okay. Fanning.

200
02:09:25,594 --> 02:09:27,949
-What about the pump station?
-Just a fight.

201
02:09:28,234 --> 02:09:31,465
We took them both in to cool off.
They straightened out soon.

202
02:09:31,754 --> 02:09:33,551
-Gil?
-Pretty quiet.

203
02:09:33,834 --> 02:09:36,906
Couple of calls about noise.
Nothing much.

204
02:09:40,154 --> 02:09:43,908
Who ordered all these pressure packs?
This is a mine, not a war.

205
02:09:44,194 --> 02:09:46,992
-You did, doctor.
-I said 1 00. Not 1 ,000.

206
02:09:47,874 --> 02:09:51,583
I said 1 00, which can't be mistaken
for anything except 1 00.

207
02:09:51,914 --> 02:09:54,269
It doesn't sound remotely
Iike 1 ,000. Listen!

208
02:09:54,554 --> 02:09:57,671
You'll hear what I mean.
One thousand.

209
02:09:57,954 --> 02:09:59,626
One hundred.

210
02:10:00,154 --> 02:10:01,303
Totally different.

211
02:10:01,674 --> 02:10:04,313
You think they sound the same?
Who are you, anyway?

212
02:10:04,594 --> 02:10:05,709
Are you Dr. Lazarus?

213
02:10:05,994 --> 02:10:09,828
Two aspirins and call me in the morning.
Doctor joke. Are you the new marshal?

214
02:10:10,114 --> 02:10:11,786
Yes. I'd like to talk to you.

215
02:10:12,114 --> 02:10:15,345
I got an alibi. Four people will swear
we were playing poker.

216
02:10:15,634 --> 02:10:16,703
I never heard that one before.

217
02:10:16,994 --> 02:10:18,950
-That's really funny.
-Sorry.

218
02:10:19,874 --> 02:10:24,106
Yesterday, a man went into the
atmosphere without his pressure suit.

219
02:10:24,554 --> 02:10:27,990
A couple of days before, another
man cut his suit open on purpose.

220
02:10:28,274 --> 02:10:29,627
It happens here.

221
02:10:30,594 --> 02:10:31,424
How often?

222
02:10:31,714 --> 02:10:34,945
-I don't know. It just happens here.
-Why?

223
02:10:35,234 --> 02:10:37,350
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I can't tell you why.

224
02:10:37,714 --> 02:10:39,864
Some people can't take it
here after awhile.

225
02:10:40,234 --> 02:10:41,792
-Did you do autopsies?
-No.

226
02:10:42,074 --> 02:10:42,870
Why not?

227
02:10:43,154 --> 02:10:45,622
The Company wanted the bodies
shipped out quickly.

228
02:10:45,994 --> 02:10:49,384
Secondly, when one exposes
himself to zero-pressure atmosphere. . .

229
02:10:49,674 --> 02:10:51,073
. . .there isn't a lot to inspect.

230
02:10:51,634 --> 02:10:53,989
In the third place,
you're becoming a nuisance.

231
02:10:54,274 --> 02:10:55,104
Yes, I know.

232
02:10:55,634 --> 02:10:59,707
Give me a report of all of the incidents
happening over the past 6 months.

233
02:11:00,194 --> 02:11:04,187
I'd like it soon, or I might just kick
your nasty ass all over this floor.

234
02:11:04,594 --> 02:11:06,107
That's a marshal joke.

235
02:12:48,874 --> 02:12:49,989
It's open.

236
02:13:01,514 --> 02:13:05,063
I didn't know what you'd like to eat,
so I brought everything.

237
02:13:07,194 --> 02:13:08,991
Listen, you got to eat something.

238
02:13:09,994 --> 02:13:12,554
Can't catch crooks
on an empty stomach.

239
02:13:17,114 --> 02:13:19,582
I know how you feel. I do.

240
02:13:22,434 --> 02:13:25,392
The second time I did a tour,
my wife had skipped off. . .

241
02:13:25,674 --> 02:13:27,744
. . .with some computer programmer.

242
02:13:28,874 --> 02:13:30,307
I have two daughters.

243
02:13:31,994 --> 02:13:33,791
They call the programmer daddy.

244
02:13:35,914 --> 02:13:37,791
My wife said she was happy.

245
02:13:38,274 --> 02:13:40,549
I said, ""Happy?
The guy looks so boring. ""

246
02:13:40,834 --> 02:13:43,871
She said he was not Mr. Excitement,
but he was always home.

247
02:13:44,794 --> 02:13:46,671
You can't argue with that.

248
02:13:47,634 --> 02:13:48,953
Try the food, it's not bad.

249
02:13:49,834 --> 02:13:51,233
I will.

250
02:13:56,634 --> 02:13:57,703
The hookers are nice.

251
02:13:59,394 --> 02:14:00,907
They can help when you're lonely.

252
02:14:02,354 --> 02:14:03,582
I'm sure.

253
02:14:04,514 --> 02:14:06,186
I get the feeling I'm bombing.

254
02:14:06,954 --> 02:14:10,913
No, you're not. I appreciate
what you're doing. I really do.

255
02:14:12,594 --> 02:14:14,107
No, it's just. . .

256
02:14:15,434 --> 02:14:18,312
. . .I'd like to be on my own for now.

257
02:14:20,714 --> 02:14:21,942
I understand.

258
02:14:26,114 --> 02:14:27,308
Marshal. . .

259
02:14:28,114 --> 02:14:30,105
. . .if you need anything. . .

260
02:14:30,674 --> 02:14:32,665
. . .if you just want to talk. . .

261
02:14:33,954 --> 02:14:34,830
. . .please call me.

262
02:15:06,074 --> 02:15:08,190
We've got a response on your request.

263
02:15:11,274 --> 02:15:13,504
I'm trying to keep my composure...

264
02:15:13,794 --> 02:15:17,230
...and like everything else I do,
I think I'm messing this up.

265
02:15:18,234 --> 02:15:21,943
I despise these message things.
I'm just such a coward.

266
02:15:23,914 --> 02:15:28,351
I couldn 't look at your face and say
what I'm about to say. I just couldn 't.

267
02:15:29,394 --> 02:15:32,830
If you were in front of me,
I'd change my mind.

268
02:15:36,954 --> 02:15:37,943
What?

269
02:15:38,434 --> 02:15:39,583
How bad?

270
02:15:39,914 --> 02:15:41,142
I'll be right there.

271
02:15:51,834 --> 02:15:56,066
Marshal, he's in the west wing.
Sergeant Montone is waiting for you.

272
02:15:56,354 --> 02:16:00,188
He's in a leisure compartment roughing
up a hooker. She pushed the alarm.

273
02:16:00,474 --> 02:16:04,433
When I responded, he said he had a knife
and would kill her if I didn't leave.

274
02:16:05,674 --> 02:16:09,553
A crane operator named Sagan. Been
here 1 1 months, never caused trouble.

275
02:16:09,834 --> 02:16:11,745
-How's the girl?
-She's still alive.

276
02:16:12,074 --> 02:16:12,950
Is he stoned?

277
02:16:13,234 --> 02:16:15,509
Beats me. Some guys like
to slap hookers around.

278
02:16:19,514 --> 02:16:24,030
This is Marshal O'Niel. Let that girl
out and no one's going to hurt you.

279
02:16:25,554 --> 02:16:26,782
Now listen to me!

280
02:16:27,074 --> 02:16:30,384
Just listen.
I can't go away and you know that.

281
02:16:30,674 --> 02:16:32,346
Now nobody's going to hurt you.

282
02:16:32,874 --> 02:16:34,865
If you want to talk, we'll talk.

283
02:16:35,154 --> 02:16:36,792
I won't try to break in. . .

284
02:16:37,074 --> 02:16:39,952
. . .and you don't do anything crazy
with that girl. Okay?

285
02:16:40,274 --> 02:16:41,070
Go away!

286
02:16:44,674 --> 02:16:47,507
-Get me a maintenance worker.
-Yes, sir.

287
02:16:50,594 --> 02:16:54,223
Which vent leads to the air conditioning
duct for number two compartment?

288
02:16:55,394 --> 02:16:56,383
Open it.

289
02:17:11,394 --> 02:17:15,353
Open the hydraulic valves to release
the door locks when I tell you.

290
02:17:29,914 --> 02:17:31,347
Sagan, can you hear me?

291
02:17:31,714 --> 02:17:32,544
I hear you!

292
02:17:32,954 --> 02:17:34,467
I'll explain this to you. . .

293
02:17:34,754 --> 02:17:36,073
. . .very carefully.

294
02:17:36,794 --> 02:17:39,547
I will release the hydraulic pressure
on the door locks.

295
02:17:40,074 --> 02:17:41,632
It will open this door.

296
02:17:42,954 --> 02:17:45,070
You cannot keep the doors closed. . .

297
02:17:45,674 --> 02:17:46,789
. . .and stay in.

298
02:17:47,074 --> 02:17:49,952
Why don't you just come out
and make it easy?

299
02:17:50,394 --> 02:17:52,988
The second that door opens,
I'll kill her!

300
02:17:53,394 --> 02:17:54,383
I'm going to slice her!

301
02:17:55,114 --> 02:17:56,308
I hate her!

302
02:17:56,674 --> 02:17:57,902
I won't argue with you.

303
02:17:58,954 --> 02:18:00,546
And I won't trick you.

304
02:18:01,674 --> 02:18:04,188
I'm going to count
down from ten to one.

305
02:18:05,394 --> 02:18:08,511
At one, the door
will spring open slowly.

306
02:18:09,954 --> 02:18:11,182
I will not rush in.

307
02:18:11,834 --> 02:18:13,153
I will not shoot you.

308
02:18:13,594 --> 02:18:16,062
I don't want to hurt anybody,
including you.

309
02:18:17,194 --> 02:18:18,752
Whatever the problem is. . .

310
02:18:19,114 --> 02:18:22,345
. . .we can work it out,
without hurting anybody.

311
02:18:22,634 --> 02:18:24,784
You're going to kill me.

312
02:18:25,074 --> 02:18:27,508
No, I'm not.
You have my word.

313
02:18:29,754 --> 02:18:33,144
You also have my word
that if you kill that girl. . .

314
02:18:33,754 --> 02:18:35,153
. . .I will kill you.

315
02:18:37,474 --> 02:18:39,908
Now I'm going to count down
from ten. . .

316
02:18:40,194 --> 02:18:41,707
. . .to one, slowly.

317
02:18:42,834 --> 02:18:44,552
Just do as I say.

318
02:18:46,594 --> 02:18:47,549
Ten. . .

319
02:18:48,914 --> 02:18:49,983
. . .nine. . .

320
02:19:28,714 --> 02:19:31,547
Well, he turned.
I saw the knife.

321
02:20:16,714 --> 02:20:19,433
Jaw looks broken.
Maybe the nose.

322
02:20:21,274 --> 02:20:23,344
Contusions.
Neck wounds look superficial.

323
02:20:23,914 --> 02:20:25,791
Jesus Christ,
who did this to her?

324
02:20:26,154 --> 02:20:27,872
A worker. Went nuts.

325
02:20:28,634 --> 02:20:30,113
It happens here, remember?

326
02:20:30,394 --> 02:20:32,430
I got that list.
She's bleeding in the abdomen.

327
02:20:32,714 --> 02:20:36,468
-Why didn't you bring it to my office?
-I don't make house calls.

328
02:20:37,754 --> 02:20:38,664
She'll be all right?

329
02:20:38,994 --> 02:20:40,791
Maybe, if you let me do my job.

330
02:20:54,954 --> 02:20:57,149
28 in the last 6 months.

331
02:20:57,914 --> 02:20:59,632
I wonder in the 6 months before.

332
02:21:01,034 --> 02:21:02,752
24. I've got initiative.

333
02:21:03,634 --> 02:21:04,987
Good for you.

334
02:21:07,314 --> 02:21:10,624
You want to know how many
in the 6 months before that? Two.

335
02:21:11,274 --> 02:21:12,070
Are you sure?

336
02:21:12,794 --> 02:21:16,753
I'm unpleasant, not stupid.
Of course I'm sure, I can count.

337
02:21:17,714 --> 02:21:20,182
-Well, what do you think?
-I don't know.

338
02:21:21,714 --> 02:21:25,548
Almost nobody has both oars
in the water, as far as I'm concerned.

339
02:21:25,834 --> 02:21:30,305
Why people start to lose their marbles
in greater numbers isn't so mystifying.

340
02:21:30,634 --> 02:21:33,467
I don't know why more of them
didn't do it sooner.

341
02:21:33,794 --> 02:21:35,068
Where are the bodies sent?

342
02:21:35,474 --> 02:21:37,863
They usually ship them out
on the next shuttle.

343
02:21:38,514 --> 02:21:41,506
They wrap them up and jettison
them halfway to the station.

344
02:21:41,794 --> 02:21:44,024
Burial at sea and all that crap.

345
02:23:52,754 --> 02:23:56,508
Lazarus? This is O 'Niel.
I'll see you in the hospital right away.

346
02:23:57,994 --> 02:23:59,666
Do you know what time it is?

347
02:24:01,034 --> 02:24:02,786
You'd better be dying.

348
02:24:31,194 --> 02:24:33,947
-Is this going to take long?
-You're kidding me.

349
02:24:38,754 --> 02:24:42,303
That doesn't mean much.
Blood type, cholesterol count.

350
02:24:42,794 --> 02:24:44,671
This blood is from a dead person.

351
02:24:45,034 --> 02:24:45,864
Very good.

352
02:24:47,914 --> 02:24:49,142
No alcohol.

353
02:24:49,794 --> 02:24:51,068
He ate dinner.

354
02:24:51,914 --> 02:24:54,109
Protein, carbohydrates. . .

355
02:24:54,954 --> 02:24:56,307
. . .more carbohydrates.

356
02:24:56,594 --> 02:24:58,471
He didn't eat his vegetables.

357
02:24:59,634 --> 02:25:00,987
No nicotine.

358
02:25:03,114 --> 02:25:04,672
Some tranquilizers.

359
02:25:05,274 --> 02:25:08,471
Yeah, they're Company tranquilizers.
Standard issue.

360
02:25:09,674 --> 02:25:12,029
Blood sugar and hemoglobin are normal.

361
02:25:14,154 --> 02:25:15,348
-Hello.
-What?

362
02:25:15,634 --> 02:25:16,828
I don't know.

363
02:25:20,674 --> 02:25:21,709
Shit.

364
02:25:31,194 --> 02:25:34,948
Such a smart piece of equipment,
and a wreck like me trying to run it.

365
02:25:36,234 --> 02:25:39,226
You know, you haven't
your medical all-star here.

366
02:25:40,074 --> 02:25:42,463
Company doctors are like ships' doctors.

367
02:25:42,794 --> 02:25:45,706
Most are one shuttle flight ahead
of a malpractice suit.

368
02:25:46,954 --> 02:25:48,307
Something's there, isn't it?

369
02:25:48,594 --> 02:25:49,663
Maybe.

370
02:26:03,114 --> 02:26:06,106
I spend my days dispensing
tranquilizers to the workers. . .

371
02:26:06,394 --> 02:26:09,625
. . .and certifying that the prostitutes
don't have syphilis.

372
02:26:09,914 --> 02:26:12,382
I don't know
how to analyze a new molecule.

373
02:26:21,794 --> 02:26:22,670
Hello.

374
02:26:24,714 --> 02:26:25,749
Is it a drug?

375
02:26:26,354 --> 02:26:27,867
You just won a prize.

376
02:26:28,834 --> 02:26:29,983
It's some kind of narcotic.

377
02:26:31,674 --> 02:26:33,551
Nothing I've ever seen before.

378
02:26:33,834 --> 02:26:35,062
Synthetic.

379
02:26:39,114 --> 02:26:39,944
Bingo.

380
02:26:41,554 --> 02:26:43,431
Polydichloric Euthimal.

381
02:26:44,754 --> 02:26:49,145
Those stupid bastards
are taking Polydichloric Euthimal!

382
02:26:50,154 --> 02:26:53,305
It's an amphetamine.
Strongest thing you ever saw.

383
02:26:53,914 --> 02:26:55,233
Makes you feel wonderful.

384
02:26:55,634 --> 02:26:58,865
You do 1 4 hours of work in 6 hours.
That kind of nonsense.

385
02:26:59,154 --> 02:27:02,226
Especially manual labor.
It makes you work like a horse.

386
02:27:02,514 --> 02:27:06,905
The Army tested it a few years ago.
It made everybody work all right.

387
02:27:07,754 --> 02:27:09,107
Then it made them psychotic.

388
02:27:09,394 --> 02:27:12,511
It takes a while,
ten, maybe eleven months.

389
02:27:13,554 --> 02:27:15,704
And then it fries your brain.

390
02:27:16,954 --> 02:27:20,105
You said it's synthetic.
Can it be made here?

391
02:27:20,594 --> 02:27:22,107
No. Impossible.

392
02:27:22,634 --> 02:27:24,511
It has to have been shipped in.

393
02:27:28,234 --> 02:27:29,792
No autopsies.

394
02:27:30,954 --> 02:27:32,467
So nobody knows anything.

395
02:27:34,074 --> 02:27:38,306
The workers are producing more,
so the Company's making bigger profits.

396
02:27:38,634 --> 02:27:40,829
They're not about to ask any questions.

397
02:27:42,474 --> 02:27:43,873
It's quite a setup.

398
02:27:46,954 --> 02:27:49,024
Don't say anything
to anybody about this.

399
02:27:50,514 --> 02:27:52,027
I did good, didn't I?

400
02:27:52,434 --> 02:27:53,628
For a wreck.

401
02:27:55,874 --> 02:27:57,227
You did good.

402
02:32:22,994 --> 02:32:23,744
9 - 7.

403
02:32:28,114 --> 02:32:29,786
Do you want to tell me about it?

404
02:32:30,074 --> 02:32:31,348
Tell you about what?

405
02:32:31,834 --> 02:32:32,710
Sheppard.

406
02:32:35,194 --> 02:32:36,468
What about him?

407
02:32:37,114 --> 02:32:38,786
How deep are you in?

408
02:32:44,474 --> 02:32:45,589
Not too deep.

409
02:32:47,954 --> 02:32:49,672
I'm paid to look the other way.

410
02:32:55,434 --> 02:32:58,471
You don't do anything bad,
you just don't do anything good.

411
02:33:00,234 --> 02:33:01,872
I'm going to bust Sheppard.

412
02:33:02,714 --> 02:33:03,908
Are you serious?

413
02:33:06,794 --> 02:33:09,228
This is no place for heroes.
You try to bust him. . .

414
02:33:09,514 --> 02:33:11,391
. . .you're messing
with more than you think.

415
02:33:16,194 --> 02:33:18,469
You're talking about
the general manager.

416
02:33:18,754 --> 02:33:20,312
He's a real hotshot here.

417
02:33:20,594 --> 02:33:25,543
It's big money, people and places
that we only know from letterheads.

418
02:33:27,514 --> 02:33:30,187
This guy is connected with more
than just the Company.

419
02:33:32,154 --> 02:33:35,430
I mean it.
There's some serious stuff involved.

420
02:33:39,114 --> 02:33:40,467
What will this prove?

421
02:33:40,954 --> 02:33:45,152
I'm not trying to prove anything.
That stuff they sell is killing people.

422
02:33:50,674 --> 02:33:52,073
What will you do with me?

423
02:33:52,474 --> 02:33:53,589
I don't know.

424
02:33:56,474 --> 02:33:57,509
You want me to resign?

425
02:33:57,794 --> 02:34:02,424
No. Just don't come between Sheppard
and me. Just keep taking your money. . .

426
02:34:02,714 --> 02:34:04,113
. . .and looking the other way.

427
02:34:04,634 --> 02:34:06,306
I don't want you.

428
02:34:06,594 --> 02:34:07,663
I want him.

429
02:34:09,394 --> 02:34:10,713
Your serve.

430
02:40:29,634 --> 02:40:30,669
Think it over.

431
02:40:40,674 --> 02:40:41,709
He's in cell 36.

432
02:40:42,074 --> 02:40:43,826
-Has he said anything?
-Not a peep.

433
02:40:44,114 --> 02:40:45,433
Anyone ask about him?

434
02:40:45,714 --> 02:40:47,591
If anyone does,
I want to know.

435
02:40:55,154 --> 02:40:56,064
This is O'Niel.

436
02:40:56,354 --> 02:40:59,187
The report says you were carrying
4 ounces of Euthimal. . .

437
02:41:00,274 --> 02:41:01,548
. . .which is 400 doses.

438
02:41:01,834 --> 02:41:03,552
I don't know what you're talking about.

439
02:41:03,834 --> 02:41:05,062
Of course you don't.

440
02:41:06,074 --> 02:41:07,666
How much does Sheppard pay you?

441
02:41:07,954 --> 02:41:10,104
I don't know what you're talking about.

442
02:41:10,394 --> 02:41:13,067
You'll love it here, though some
start to go crazy at night. . .

443
02:41:13,394 --> 02:41:14,986
. . .when you can't feel the floor.

444
02:41:15,394 --> 02:41:19,831
And sometimes the air tether
gets knotted and a man suffocates.

445
02:41:20,114 --> 02:41:21,832
But that doesn't happen too often.

446
02:41:22,114 --> 02:41:23,342
O'Niel, piss off!

447
02:41:23,674 --> 02:41:24,629
I like that.

448
02:41:24,954 --> 02:41:26,990
You're real quick with a comeback.

449
02:41:27,794 --> 02:41:29,352
I've got you nailed.

450
02:41:29,634 --> 02:41:31,784
I've got witnesses and evidence.

451
02:41:32,074 --> 02:41:37,068
You'll be shipped back and do time that
will make this place look like a picnic!

452
02:41:37,914 --> 02:41:41,429
Now don't do a deal with me.
Don't get yourself a reduced sentence.

453
02:41:41,714 --> 02:41:45,389
Just do your hard time
while Sheppard laughs his ass off.

454
02:41:46,954 --> 02:41:49,946
I've got to hand it to you.
You're pretty sharp.

455
02:41:50,234 --> 02:41:52,031
See you around, tough guy.

456
02:41:52,554 --> 02:41:54,624
Nobody talks to him.
Nobody touches him.

457
02:41:55,034 --> 02:41:56,911
I mean nobody, you understand?

458
02:41:57,954 --> 02:41:58,943
I understand.

459
02:42:16,914 --> 02:42:21,510
You know something? I can hit
a seven iron 500 yards in this place.

460
02:42:22,074 --> 02:42:23,666
Fix yourself a drink.

461
02:42:23,954 --> 02:42:25,148
No, thanks.

462
02:42:26,434 --> 02:42:27,628
You've been busy.

463
02:42:28,274 --> 02:42:29,753
So have you.

464
02:42:30,034 --> 02:42:31,353
How much do you want?

465
02:42:31,954 --> 02:42:33,307
How much?

466
02:42:35,354 --> 02:42:37,993
Just what we need here,
a goddamn hero.

467
02:42:40,474 --> 02:42:43,352
You know something?
This rug has a slight break to the left.

468
02:42:46,634 --> 02:42:49,706
Let me tell you what you're
dealing with. I run a franchise.

469
02:42:49,994 --> 02:42:53,543
I'm hired to dig as much ore
as possible out of this hellhole.

470
02:42:53,834 --> 02:42:57,622
There's a guy like me on every
mining operation all over this system.

471
02:42:57,914 --> 02:43:00,064
My hookers are clean,
some good-looking.

472
02:43:00,354 --> 02:43:02,822
My booze isn't watered.
The workers are happy.

473
02:43:03,114 --> 02:43:07,107
When the workers are happy, they dig
more ore. They get more bonus money.

474
02:43:07,394 --> 02:43:10,113
When they dig more ore,
the Company's happy.

475
02:43:10,394 --> 02:43:12,146
When the Company's happy,
I'm happy.

476
02:43:12,434 --> 02:43:14,948
-Sounds wonderful.
-Nothing here is wonderful.

477
02:43:15,234 --> 02:43:16,986
It works. That's enough.

478
02:43:18,674 --> 02:43:22,349
Now every year a new marshal
comes to start his tour.

479
02:43:22,634 --> 02:43:26,673
They all know the score. You know
the score. You're no different.

480
02:43:27,754 --> 02:43:30,712
If this hero routine is to get
your price up, I'll think about it.

481
02:43:33,434 --> 02:43:34,549
What are you after?

482
02:43:35,434 --> 02:43:36,628
You.

483
02:43:40,034 --> 02:43:42,309
What is it with guys like you?

484
02:43:42,594 --> 02:43:44,869
If you were such a goddamn super-cop. . .

485
02:43:45,154 --> 02:43:48,464
. . .what are you doing on
a Company mining operating like Io?

486
02:43:48,954 --> 02:43:52,549
They didn't send you here as a reward
for your sterling service.

487
02:43:53,234 --> 02:43:55,350
You know that and I know that.

488
02:43:56,594 --> 02:43:58,073
I read your record.

489
02:43:59,714 --> 02:44:01,511
You've got a big mouth.

490
02:44:02,354 --> 02:44:04,914
That's why you're sent
from one toilet to the next.

491
02:44:05,194 --> 02:44:08,869
Me? I don't plan on spending
the rest of my life doing this.

492
02:44:09,154 --> 02:44:10,792
Well, good for you.

493
02:44:11,074 --> 02:44:13,872
Now, look, this charade
of yours is silly.

494
02:44:14,154 --> 02:44:17,032
You meddle, I want you to know
what you're meddling with.

495
02:44:17,314 --> 02:44:19,623
You got something to prove,
prove it to yourself, not to me.

496
02:44:21,514 --> 02:44:22,833
I'll see you around.

497
02:44:25,754 --> 02:44:28,632
If you're looking for money,
you're smarter than you look!

498
02:44:29,554 --> 02:44:31,510
If you're not,
you're a lot dumber.

499
02:44:33,274 --> 02:44:35,344
I'm probably a lot dumber.

500
02:44:36,834 --> 02:44:38,950
That can be very dangerous.

501
02:45:04,194 --> 02:45:06,424
All right, tough guy, time to talk.

502
02:48:46,754 --> 02:48:48,984
What's the matter?
Sun in your eyes?

503
02:48:49,354 --> 02:48:51,822
Well, well, well, if it isn't the law!

504
02:48:52,554 --> 02:48:55,387
Sheppard, guess what
I just found in a meat locker?

505
02:48:55,714 --> 02:48:59,389
You know, I have a feeling that
you'll tell me even if I don't guess.

506
02:48:59,754 --> 02:49:03,713
250 pounds of hamburger
named Yario that works for you.

507
02:49:04,674 --> 02:49:07,108
I also found your shipment of PDE.

508
02:49:08,994 --> 02:49:11,713
I threw the hamburger in jail
and the PDE in the toilet.

509
02:49:11,994 --> 02:49:14,462
Or the other way around?
I can't remember.

510
02:49:14,834 --> 02:49:15,789
You've been busy.

511
02:49:16,074 --> 02:49:17,632
Yeah, are you proud of me?

512
02:49:19,554 --> 02:49:20,384
Real proud.

513
02:49:20,954 --> 02:49:22,182
Good shot.

514
02:49:23,194 --> 02:49:24,707
You destroyed the shipment?

515
02:49:27,234 --> 02:49:29,304
You do have a flair for the dramatic.

516
02:49:29,674 --> 02:49:30,663
Was it expensive?

517
02:49:31,554 --> 02:49:33,465
More than you can ever imagine.

518
02:49:34,834 --> 02:49:36,552
You could be out of business.

519
02:49:38,874 --> 02:49:42,662
You know, I've misjudged you.
You're not stupid. You're crazy.

520
02:49:43,274 --> 02:49:45,071
You think you caused
an inconvenience?

521
02:49:45,394 --> 02:49:46,873
Is that what you think?

522
02:49:47,154 --> 02:49:49,429
Why don't you go home
and polish your badge?

523
02:49:49,714 --> 02:49:52,751
You're dealing with grownups here.
You're out of your league.

524
02:49:53,034 --> 02:49:55,912
Whoever sent that shipment
will be mad that you lost it.

525
02:49:56,234 --> 02:49:57,952
Grownups have no sense of humor.

526
02:49:59,914 --> 02:50:03,145
I'd play a firm eight iron there.
Just swing easy.

527
02:50:07,794 --> 02:50:09,432
You're dead.

528
02:50:09,714 --> 02:50:10,988
Do you hear me?

529
02:50:11,954 --> 02:50:13,182
I hear you.

530
02:50:25,034 --> 02:50:26,706
Bello ws, this is Sheppard.

531
02:50:26,994 --> 02:50:29,030
What the hell's been
going on down there?

532
02:50:29,314 --> 02:50:33,387
Just a little trouble. I can take care
of it. Send me a few of your best men.

533
02:50:34,154 --> 02:50:35,428
And the two you had?

534
02:50:35,714 --> 02:50:38,069
Send me the men!
I'll straighten everything out.

535
02:50:38,354 --> 02:50:40,549
My people are not going to like this.

536
02:50:40,914 --> 02:50:43,826
-I'll have it straightened out.
-When do you need the men?

537
02:50:44,114 --> 02:50:45,388
On the next shuttle.

538
02:50:45,674 --> 02:50:48,427
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you back later.

539
02:51:52,634 --> 02:51:53,464
What have we got?

540
02:51:53,754 --> 02:51:55,187
Break-in at the women's quarters.

541
02:51:55,474 --> 02:51:57,829
Can't tell if it was
a pervert or a burglary.

542
02:51:58,114 --> 02:52:00,150
The guy was surprised
and ran like hell.

543
02:52:00,434 --> 02:52:02,072
-Any prints?
-Nothing clear.

544
02:52:02,354 --> 02:52:03,833
-What else?
-Not much.

545
02:52:04,114 --> 02:52:05,832
A hell of a fight in the cafeteria.

546
02:52:06,114 --> 02:52:08,344
A broken nose and teeth
was the damage.

547
02:52:08,634 --> 02:52:10,625
Both guys are cooling out in the tank.

548
02:52:11,514 --> 02:52:13,186
Where's your sergeant stripes?

549
02:52:14,114 --> 02:52:17,504
Well, it's only been a couple
of days since Sergeant Montone--

550
02:52:17,794 --> 02:52:22,310
You're the new sergeant.
You wear your stripes. Put them on now.

551
02:53:02,034 --> 02:53:05,504
This is Bello ws. You've got
the men you want and it wasn 't easy.

552
02:53:05,794 --> 02:53:07,022
My people are very unhappy.

553
02:53:07,314 --> 02:53:10,192
This could cause trouble for us
on the other operations.

554
02:53:10,474 --> 02:53:14,149
If the Company got wind of what's
going on, they'd clamp down like a vise.

555
02:53:14,434 --> 02:53:16,743
They can 't afford
to lose their franchise.

556
02:53:17,034 --> 02:53:20,788
It could put my people out of business.
And my people like being in business.

557
02:53:21,194 --> 02:53:22,627
Tell them not to worry.

558
02:53:22,914 --> 02:53:23,824
How good are the men?

559
02:53:24,114 --> 02:53:26,912
The best. They've left
on the shuttle arriving Sunday.

560
02:53:27,194 --> 02:53:29,424
-They have their own weapons?
-Yes.

561
02:53:29,714 --> 02:53:31,033
The target is O 'Niel.

562
02:53:32,154 --> 02:53:34,793
-You better not mess this up!
-I won 't.

563
02:53:35,074 --> 02:53:36,507
-It's your party.
-Yes, it is.

564
02:53:36,794 --> 02:53:38,705
-How much help will he have?
-None.

565
02:53:38,994 --> 02:53:40,552
-You sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

566
02:53:41,754 --> 02:53:44,712
No one here will stick
their neck out for anyone.

567
02:53:44,994 --> 02:53:47,189
Once word spreads that
these guys are pros...

568
02:53:47,514 --> 02:53:48,742
... there'll be no trouble.

569
02:53:49,034 --> 02:53:51,673
I've got someone on the inside
who 'll spread the word.

570
02:53:52,034 --> 02:53:54,502
Don 't worry.
He's a dead man.

571
02:53:54,834 --> 02:53:56,904
I'll tell you,
if this doesn 't work out...

572
02:53:57,194 --> 02:53:59,788
... the next guys who come
will be coming for you.

573
02:54:00,074 --> 02:54:02,952
No sweat.
I'll call you when it's over.

574
02:56:07,834 --> 02:56:09,392
How many can I count on?

575
02:56:10,274 --> 02:56:12,549
Well, I don't know, sir.

576
02:56:14,554 --> 02:56:15,509
What about you?

577
02:56:16,594 --> 02:56:17,822
Well, you see. . .

578
02:56:19,034 --> 02:56:20,592
. . .most of us are. . .

579
02:56:21,594 --> 02:56:22,549
. . .most are young.

580
02:56:22,834 --> 02:56:25,109
-We have families.
-I have a family.

581
02:56:32,074 --> 02:56:34,269
I know where we stand.

582
02:56:35,434 --> 02:56:36,708
Thank you, sergeant.

583
02:57:15,314 --> 02:57:18,784
That's pretty good.
Playing by yourself and losing.

584
02:57:19,834 --> 02:57:23,463
I'd join you in this dumb game
if I could play sitting down.

585
02:57:26,194 --> 02:57:28,071
Yes, I'm well, thank you.

586
02:57:28,634 --> 02:57:29,828
Pretty busy.

587
02:57:30,354 --> 02:57:32,549
Seems there's
some flu going around.

588
02:57:32,834 --> 02:57:35,951
You'd be surprised how many workers
will be sick this Sunday.

589
02:57:36,234 --> 02:57:37,826
It's your actual epidemic.

590
02:57:38,114 --> 02:57:40,389
Are you going to be sick
this Sunday?

591
02:57:42,674 --> 02:57:45,950
If you want sterling character,
you're in the wrong place.

592
02:57:49,594 --> 02:57:54,031
If you're the guy you're supposed to be,
you wouldn't stick around.

593
02:57:54,714 --> 02:57:57,512
-That's why they sent you.
-Maybe they made a mistake.

594
02:57:59,154 --> 02:58:01,668
I was afraid you'd say
something like that.

595
02:58:02,834 --> 02:58:05,064
You really think
you're making a difference?

596
02:58:07,154 --> 02:58:09,190
Then why, for God's sake?

597
02:58:09,474 --> 02:58:10,668
Because. . .

598
02:58:11,714 --> 02:58:13,386
. . .maybe they are right.

599
02:58:14,874 --> 02:58:18,833
They send me here to this pile of shit
because they think I belong here.

600
02:58:21,074 --> 02:58:22,632
I want to find out. . .

601
02:58:23,834 --> 02:58:25,187
. . .if they're right.

602
02:58:27,274 --> 02:58:31,904
A whole machine works because
everybody does what they're supposed to.

603
02:58:33,434 --> 02:58:34,787
And I found out. . .

604
02:58:35,634 --> 02:58:39,104
. . .I was supposed
to be something I didn't like.

605
02:58:40,874 --> 02:58:43,104
That's what's in the program.

606
02:58:43,514 --> 02:58:47,746
That's my rotten little part,
in the rotten machine.

607
02:58:49,834 --> 02:58:51,267
I don't like it.

608
02:58:52,954 --> 02:58:56,549
So I'm going to find out
if they're right.

609
02:59:05,154 --> 02:59:07,463
Your wife is one stupid lady.

610
02:59:09,874 --> 02:59:11,068
You want to go get drunk?

611
02:59:16,834 --> 02:59:19,428
At least you have some sense left.

612
03:00:49,794 --> 03:00:51,193
Hello, there.

613
03:00:53,634 --> 03:00:55,192
I'm doing it again.

614
03:00:55,594 --> 03:00:58,028
I've had so much time
to prepare what to say...

615
03:00:58,314 --> 03:01:02,432
...and here I am looking at your face,
and my mouth has gone to mush.

616
03:01:02,994 --> 03:01:03,983
How's Paul?

617
03:01:04,274 --> 03:01:06,230
He's fine. I promised him...

618
03:01:06,514 --> 03:01:08,869
...he could talk to you.
He's in the next room.

619
03:01:09,154 --> 03:01:10,109
Are you well?

620
03:01:13,314 --> 03:01:14,383
I'm okay.

621
03:01:18,114 --> 03:01:19,388
Paulie and I....

622
03:01:20,714 --> 03:01:23,433
The reservations have come through.
We're flying home.

623
03:01:25,154 --> 03:01:26,872
The reservations are for three.

624
03:01:28,554 --> 03:01:29,907
That was thoughtful.

625
03:01:31,074 --> 03:01:32,063
I can't.

626
03:01:32,354 --> 03:01:33,070
Why?

627
03:01:33,674 --> 03:01:35,187
I just can't.

628
03:01:37,514 --> 03:01:38,424
I wish I could.

629
03:01:38,714 --> 03:01:39,988
What is so important?

630
03:01:42,114 --> 03:01:44,469
I'm too tired to try to explain.

631
03:01:46,114 --> 03:01:47,547
You're making a difference?

632
03:01:47,834 --> 03:01:52,464
Do you think what you're doing
is worth giving up your family for?

633
03:01:56,994 --> 03:01:58,985
You're a stubborn son of a bitch.

634
03:02:03,594 --> 03:02:05,505
Something's wrong there, isn 't it?

635
03:02:06,114 --> 03:02:07,183
No.

636
03:02:07,714 --> 03:02:10,308
I know you're in some kind of trouble.

637
03:02:10,594 --> 03:02:11,993
When you speak in sentences...

638
03:02:12,274 --> 03:02:14,629
...of less than two words,
you're in trouble. I know it.

639
03:02:14,914 --> 03:02:16,267
I'm okay.

640
03:02:18,114 --> 03:02:19,388
Damn you.

641
03:02:20,634 --> 03:02:22,226
Take care of yourself.

642
03:02:26,514 --> 03:02:28,630
You can come in now, Paulie.

643
03:02:31,594 --> 03:02:32,947
I love you.

644
03:02:42,474 --> 03:02:44,510
Hi, Paul. How are you doing?

645
03:02:44,874 --> 03:02:45,829
Great!

646
03:02:46,434 --> 03:02:50,063
Mommy let me stay up late because
this is when the call came through.

647
03:02:50,754 --> 03:02:51,948
I miss you.

648
03:02:52,234 --> 03:02:53,792
I miss you, too.

649
03:02:54,194 --> 03:02:57,266
Mommy says as soon as you get done,
you'll come home with us.

650
03:02:57,794 --> 03:02:59,386
As soon as I get done.

651
03:03:00,074 --> 03:03:01,712
What's it like on Earth?

652
03:03:02,274 --> 03:03:03,673
It's beautiful.

653
03:03:04,714 --> 03:03:07,467
You're going to see
many wonderful things.

654
03:03:08,474 --> 03:03:10,305
And you'll have friends to play with.

655
03:03:10,634 --> 03:03:14,627
Mommy says that on the flight, they
put you to sleep for more than a year.

656
03:03:15,074 --> 03:03:16,143
That's true.

657
03:03:16,554 --> 03:03:17,748
Will it hurt?

658
03:03:18,474 --> 03:03:21,113
Not a bit. You'll just wake up. . .

659
03:03:22,594 --> 03:03:23,822
. . .and be home.

660
03:03:24,194 --> 03:03:26,503
I'm going to sleep through my birthday.

661
03:03:27,754 --> 03:03:31,064
Next birthday,
I'll get you two presents.

662
03:03:31,874 --> 03:03:33,387
Can 't you come home with us?

663
03:03:35,074 --> 03:03:36,348
Not right now.

664
03:03:36,634 --> 03:03:37,908
Soon?

665
03:03:38,194 --> 03:03:39,388
Soon.

666
03:03:41,194 --> 03:03:42,547
I love you, Daddy.

667
03:03:45,194 --> 03:03:46,832
I love you too, Paul.

668
03:03:50,674 --> 03:03:52,392
You take care of Mommy.

669
03:03:52,834 --> 03:03:54,028
I will.

670
03:03:54,314 --> 03:03:56,225
See you, Daddy.

671
03:05:36,514 --> 03:05:38,266
I could use a little help.

672
03:05:42,634 --> 03:05:43,828
I thought so.

673
03:05:45,594 --> 03:05:46,709
You should protect us.

674
03:05:47,594 --> 03:05:49,391
You're the police. It's your job.

675
03:05:49,674 --> 03:05:50,948
Where are your men?

676
03:05:51,234 --> 03:05:52,462
My men?

677
03:05:53,874 --> 03:05:55,387
My men are shit.

678
03:13:58,634 --> 03:13:59,987
Jesus, take it easy!

679
03:14:00,274 --> 03:14:01,389
What are you doing here?

680
03:14:01,674 --> 03:14:04,871
I went to your office to offer help.
I saw you on the screen.

681
03:14:05,154 --> 03:14:06,826
You're heading right for them.

682
03:14:07,114 --> 03:14:08,866
You're in terrific shape.

683
03:14:09,154 --> 03:14:12,271
They've missed the artery.
I'll stop the bleeding.

684
03:14:20,354 --> 03:14:21,867
Which way were they heading?

685
03:14:22,154 --> 03:14:25,510
They were going to the operations wing.
They're trying to cut you off.

686
03:14:26,954 --> 03:14:29,946
Could you seal off the access ways
in the east quadrant?

687
03:14:30,234 --> 03:14:32,384
I'll go out around them.

688
03:14:48,594 --> 03:14:49,549
Thank you.

689
03:14:51,594 --> 03:14:54,711
Don't misconstrue.
I'm not displaying character. . .

690
03:14:54,994 --> 03:14:56,473
. . .just temporary insanity.

691
03:15:25,994 --> 03:15:29,225
I'm going outside.
Now get the hell out of here.

692
03:15:31,034 --> 03:15:31,784
I can help.

693
03:15:32,074 --> 03:15:33,746
Don't argue with me!

694
03:15:37,314 --> 03:15:38,633
Seal the access corridors. . .

695
03:15:38,954 --> 03:15:40,945
. . .and lead them into C-5.

696
03:15:43,874 --> 03:15:45,512
Don't get maudlin.

697
03:21:12,594 --> 03:21:13,913
Can I help?

698
03:21:15,034 --> 03:21:18,185
Terrific. Here comes the cavalry.
You're a bit late.

699
03:21:18,794 --> 03:21:20,546
-Is the marshal all right?
-So far.

700
03:21:21,914 --> 03:21:22,869
Where is he?

701
03:21:23,194 --> 03:21:24,547
Outside somewhere.

702
03:21:24,954 --> 03:21:26,273
Outside where?

703
03:21:26,834 --> 03:21:29,951
How the hell should I know?
Maybe in the greenhouse.

704
03:27:42,794 --> 03:27:43,909
Oh, fuck it.

705
03:28:24,074 --> 03:28:25,553
How's the arm?

706
03:28:27,954 --> 03:28:29,865
It's all right.

707
03:28:31,354 --> 03:28:36,189
I was on my way to drinking myself into
a stupor and I thought I'd say goodbye.

708
03:28:42,434 --> 03:28:43,947
You were a good friend.

709
03:28:44,234 --> 03:28:45,508
Thank you.

710
03:28:46,314 --> 03:28:50,785
Thank you. There hasn't been so much
excitement in this heap for some time.

711
03:28:53,874 --> 03:28:56,263
Well, I have to go now.

712
03:28:57,994 --> 03:29:02,033
Me too. It's going to hit the fan around
here and I want to watch it happen.

713
03:29:05,274 --> 03:29:05,990
You did good.

714
03:29:08,314 --> 03:29:09,429
So did you.

715
03:29:11,034 --> 03:29:12,262
Damn right.

716
03:32:24,754 --> 03:32:26,551

GELULA & CO., INC.

717
03:33:13,269 --> 03:33:15,225
In a mining town...

718
03:33:15,949 --> 03:33:17,667
...on the second moon of Jupiter...

719
03:33:20,069 --> 03:33:22,378
...something deadly is happening.

720
03:33:31,789 --> 03:33:35,065
Pretty soon you'll see that this is
just like every other mining town.

721
03:33:35,429 --> 03:33:37,465
I work these people hard. . .

722
03:33:38,949 --> 03:33:41,702
. . .and I let them play hard.
There's never much trouble.

723
03:33:41,949 --> 03:33:43,302
We're all professionals.

724
03:33:44,509 --> 03:33:45,498
I'm sure we are.

725
03:33:46,109 --> 03:33:48,145
We've only been here 2 weeks.

726
03:33:48,389 --> 03:33:50,698
It'll get better.
I promise.

727
03:33:51,949 --> 03:33:56,181
Nothing more on that mine incident.
It looks like some guy just went wacko.

728
03:33:58,069 --> 03:33:59,900
-It happens here.
-How often?

729
03:34:00,149 --> 03:34:02,105
I don't know.
It just happens here.

730
03:34:02,349 --> 03:34:03,338
Why?

731
03:34:03,869 --> 03:34:06,099
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I can't tell you why.

732
03:34:07,309 --> 03:34:09,539
Some people can't take it here
after awhile.

733
03:34:10,989 --> 03:34:12,547
What's that guy think he's doing?

734
03:34:13,389 --> 03:34:14,617
No way it could've been homicide.

735
03:34:16,469 --> 03:34:18,300
Had to have been a suicide.

736
03:34:19,029 --> 03:34:20,940
28 in the last six months.

737
03:34:21,429 --> 03:34:22,418
Did you do autopsies?

738
03:34:23,869 --> 03:34:24,858
No.

739
03:34:25,109 --> 03:34:26,781
Then how do you know
that it was a suicide?

740
03:34:29,189 --> 03:34:30,747
There's no other explanation.

741
03:34:33,069 --> 03:34:37,620
When one is exposed to zero pressure,
there isn't a whole lot left to inspect.

742
03:34:38,829 --> 03:34:39,978
Something's there, isn't it?

743
03:34:41,989 --> 03:34:42,899
Maybe.

744
03:34:45,829 --> 03:34:47,945
Try and meddle, I want you to know
what you're meddling with.

745
03:34:48,749 --> 03:34:50,148
You're out of your league.

746
03:34:52,029 --> 03:34:53,667
You know, we're grownups here.

747
03:34:57,589 --> 03:34:58,385
Bingo.

748
03:34:58,629 --> 03:34:59,664
Marshal. . .

749
03:35:00,229 --> 03:35:01,218
. . .you're dead.

750
03:35:01,829 --> 03:35:03,820
If you're the kind of guy
you're supposed to be. . .

751
03:35:05,149 --> 03:35:08,459
. . .you wouldn't stick around.
That's why they sent you here.

752
03:35:08,829 --> 03:35:10,057
Maybe they made a mistake.

753
03:35:32,229 --> 03:35:36,745
Outland.
The ultimate enemy is still. ..

754
03:35:36,989 --> 03:35:38,342
...man.
