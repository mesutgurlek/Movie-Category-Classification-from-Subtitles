I'm all ears.

There is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world.

A pit where men are thrown

...he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul,
your mentor.

Bane was a member
of the League of Shadows?

561
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,416
And then he was excommunicated.

562
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:25,589
And any man who is too extreme
for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.

How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?

783
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,462
I am using the truth, Master Wayne.

784
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:34,010
Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to
outsmart the truth and let it have its day.

785
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,763
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

You expect to destroy my world...

787
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,396
...and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?

788
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,231
No, no, no.

789

What does it mean?

00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,405
It means your hatred.

792
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,325
And it also means losing someone
that I have cared for...

793

...since I first heard his cries echo...

...through this house.

But it might also mean saving your life.

796
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,966
And that is more important.

Those options expired
at midnight last night.

Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud.
But for now, you're completely broke...

806
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:09,355
...and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall
into the hands of John Daggett.

01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:13,359
The weapons. We can't let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences.

808
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,487
Applied Sciences is all locked up
and off the books.

809
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:19,865
The energy project, however,
is a different story.

Let's convince the board to get behind her.
Let's show her the reactor.

We're meeting her there in 35 minutes,
so you better get dressed.

MIRANDA: You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

814

FOX:
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

Please keep hands and feet inside
the car at all times.

This is it, isn't it?

817
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,274
The reactor is beneath the river...

818
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:57,570
...so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach.

819
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,198
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.

what your investment built.

MIRANDA:
No fossil fuels.

Free clean energy for an entire city.

824
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,760
MIRANDA: Three years ago,
a Russian scientist published a paper...

825
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,221
...on weaponized fusion reactions.

826
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:29,310
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

827
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,188
I think this machine works.

828
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:38,986
Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too great.

829
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:42,239
Would it make you feel better to know
that the Russian scientist...

830
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,201
...died in a plane crash six months ago?

831

Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did.

832
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:55,211
Someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon.

I need you to take control
of Wayne Enterprises...

Nothing.

Until we can guarantee its safety.

01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,934
And if we can't?

Decommission it. Flood it.

Bruce, if you want to save the world,
you have to start trusting it.

I'm trusting you.

a non-board member here...

851
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,433
...which is highly irregular,
even if his family name is above the door.

Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

853
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,771
And he himself has run it.

only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...

...it's cost us all a lot of money.

858

And he has to go.

didn't know what to do, they had paperwork.

No autopilot.
