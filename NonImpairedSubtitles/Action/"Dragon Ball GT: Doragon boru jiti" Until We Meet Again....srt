1
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,560
I'm glad that Shen Long
has finally appeared,

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,860
but there's something strange
about this, isn't there?

3
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,530
Look, the sky hasn't
turned dark, or anything.

4
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,200
This certainly is different
from the way it usually is, huh?

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,000
Rise, Son Goku.

6
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,880
G- Goku-sa!

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,550
C- Chichi...? Ah, well
if it ain't Shen Long!

8
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,490
I put all of them away!

9
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:59,490
You understand why the Evil
Dragons appeared, yes?

10
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,830
Yeah.

11
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,160
This World and the Next
World becoming one,

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,830
as well as the dead returning to life...

13
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,170
Sure enough, that was also because
the Dragon Balls had gone funny.

14
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,510
It seems that you have relied too heavily
upon the power of the Dragon Balls.

15
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:26,850
I cannot allow you to use
the Dragon Balls any further.

16
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,860
I will remove the Dragon Balls from
before you. I will do the same of myself.

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,530
Okay, gotcha, Shen Long! But could
you grant one last wish for me first?

18
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,530
What is it?

19
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,540
As a result of all of this, a
lot of people on Earth have died.

20
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,140
But if the reason for that
lies with the Dragon Balls,

21
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,210
they all had nothing to do with it.

22
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,150
So, could you bring them all back to life?

23
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,680
I want everyone to return
the parts of the Earth

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,220
that got messed-up
because of all of this

25
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,280
back to normal together.

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,190
All right, understood.
This will be the last time.

27
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,070
Pan!

28
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,110
Gill!

29
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,480
Gill!

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,820
Pan, danger! Pan, danger!
But Gill still loves Pan!

31
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,490
Thank you, Shen Long!

32
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,490
Your wish is granted.
Come, let us go, Goku.

33
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,500
Huh? Is it that time already?

34
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,840
Climb on, Goku.

35
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
I'll be back in a little while.

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,510
Hold on, Kakarrot!

37
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,840
Are you training again?

38
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,900
Kakarrot, are you...?

39
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,520
See you later, Vegeta.

40
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,950
See ya, everybody!

41
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,190
Now see here, Goku-sa! At least
tell us where you're goin' first!

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,130
The Dragon Balls, huh? Come to mention it,

43
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:03,140
everything started when I came across
Son-kun on Mount Paozu, didn't it?

44
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,150
I wonder how long it's been since then.

45
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,410
We sure have been
friends a long time, huh?

46
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,990
Say, Shen Long, I want to stop off
at a few places on the way, okay?

47
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,180
I haven't seen any pichi
pichi gals in a while!

48
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,510
You're just as lecherous
as ever, Muten Roshi-sama.

49
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,310
You dummy! You're the one
who brought this, right?

50
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,190
You know, Kuririn-san, you sure
have died a good number of times.

51
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,790
I'm even more surprised
that you're still alive.

52
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,130
They do say us turtles live for
ten thousand years, after all.

53
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,800
This is incredible!

54
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
He really does like that stuff.

55
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,130
He sure does.

56
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,800
Goku!

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,470
Goku, he says! What a
dirty old man! Goku?

58
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,810
Heya!

59
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:14,810
Goku! If it isn't Goku!
I've come back to life again!

60
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,150
By any chance, are you...?

61
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,390
It sure has been a while, huh Kuririn?

62
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,160
And you too, Old Man Turtle Hermit!
Oh, and you too, ''Urigome!''

63
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
''Umigame.'' Geez...

64
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
So, you're still little, huh?

65
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Mm-hmm. You haven't changed either,
have you Old Timer?

66
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,500
Together like this, it's almost
like we've gone back into the past.

67
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,470
Brings back memories, doesn't it, Goku?
We trained together once, remember?

68
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,910
How we got sent out to search for that
stone that had ''turtle'' written on it,

69
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,100
and stuff?

70
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,180
The one who lost had to
give up supper that night.

71
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,180
And you did nothing but cheat, remember?

72
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,390
That's right! You're just like
you were when you were a kid,

73
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,460
and Muten Roshi-sama is still
the way he's always been...

74
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,450
It's almost like I'm the only one who
got any older... I've changed completely.

75
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,130
Say, Kuririn, you want to go a
round with me, for old time's sake?

76
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,800
Hey now, cut it out! There's no way I
could stand up to you now, is there?

77
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,810
That's okay, come at me!

78
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,570
You're a funny one, all right.
Don't embarrass me too badly!

79
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,180
Goku, are you...?

80
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,160
Just like you were long ago!
You haven't changed a bit, Kuririn!

81
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,170
R- really? Actually, even now,
No. 18 and I sometimes-- huh? Goku?

82
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:49,840
Where did you go, Goku? Goku! Hey, Goku!

83
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,510
Goku, tell Shen Long thanks
for the Dragon Balls for us.

84
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,570
Let me out of Hell!

85
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,210
How about you quiet down a little?

86
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,140
They say the weaker the dog,
the louder he barks!

87
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,080
What did you say!?

88
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,080
That's our Piccolo-san!

89
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,160
S- Son!

90
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,500
Not too shabby, Piccolo!

91
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,840
W- what are you doing down here!?
Have you come back to Hell?

92
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,440
And after all the trouble I went
to sending you back to Earth!

93
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,110
W- what's this?

94
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,270
It's okay, just shake my hand.

95
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,790
Son, are you...?

96
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,160
I've put you through nothing but trouble,

97
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,460
and I'm sorry I couldn't
pay you back, Piccolo.

98
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,130
I'll never forget you, as long as I live.

99
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,620
Son!

100
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,640
Goku-sa! Are you goin' to
be home in time for dinner!?

101
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,530
Well, well, he's gone. And here I was
goin' to fix a special treat tonight...

102
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,900
He'll be back right away anyhow,
same as he always is.

103
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,210
More importantly, Mom, about this
special treat-- what is it, what is it?

104
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,210
Tonight, we're havin'
Paozu-Newt-on-a-stick!

105
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,870
Wow! That's my favorite!

106
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,880
Well, let's all go home too.

107
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,680
Okay then, everyone, take care!

108
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,690
Mom, hurry home and fix
us that special treat!

109
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,230
Well then, we should be going, too.

110
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,900
Papa, why don't you come
over for dinner tonight?

111
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,360
Sure, I'll come, I'll come!

112
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,560
Pan-chan...

113
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:43,580
Say, Trunks, do you suppose the
Dragon Balls have really disappeared?

114
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,150
Pan-chan, we're being tested.

115
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,260
From here on, we have to not rely on
anything else, and make this planet--

116
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,730
make the universe a better place,
using our own strength.

117
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,860
Once that is recognized, I'm sure
the Dragon Balls will appear again.

118
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,870
Yeah, sure, huh? Mm-hmm!
Let's do our best!

119
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,200
Come on, let's go home, Pan-chan!

120
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,440
Hold on!

121
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:20,550
How come? I'm sure that Grandpa
just left together with Shen Long...

122
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,950
Make sure you hold that dear.

123
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,960
Grandpa...

124
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,540
Sure is warm here on Shen Long's back...

125
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:30,580
We will now hold the Tenkaichi
Tournament Junior Championship Match!

126
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,290
Son Goku-kun!

127
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,530
Ladies and gentlemen,
please direct your view over there!

128
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,570
Son Goku-kun is...

129
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,910
the great-great-great-great-grandson of
both Son Goku-san, who shares his name,

130
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,510
and who long ago, gave us many great
battles here at the Tenkaichi Tournament,

131
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:04,190
as well as the legendary hero,
Mister Satan!

132
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,860
Huh? Is he serious, Grandma Pan?
I didn't have any idea at all!

133
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Heh heh, surprised?

134
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,500
That weakling Goku...
No wonder he's become so strong.

135
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,200
Which means, Grandma Pan,
that you're...?

136
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,440
That's right. I'm Son Goku's
first-generation granddaughter, Pan-chan.

137
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
I can win... I can win... I can win...

138
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,510
Hmph! What a filthy gi!

139
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:48,900
It's not filthy! This is the gi my
ancestor wore! It's just a little bit old.

140
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,500
T- that boy looks just like
Vegeta-san, doesn't he?

141
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,840
Excuse me...

142
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,980
Are you the boy my son
is fighting's mother?

143
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,840
You're quite old, aren't you?

144
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,520
That's not it at all! I'm the
boy's great-great-grandmother!

145
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,650
Oh, no wonder. I'm so sorry.

146
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,020
Unfortunately, my boy looks like he's
the one who is going to take the victory.

147
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,530
President, the conference is about
to begin. Please return at once.

148
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,200
Hush! The best part is about to begin!

149
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Capsule Corporation... that's the
trademark from Bulma-san's place!

150
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,540
So that's it, that's
what's going on, huh?

151
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,210
This is about to get interesting!

152
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,740
Goku! Don't worry about a thing!

153
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,010
Give that kid an out-and-out,
through-and-through pounding!

154
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,190
Begin!

155
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,840
A- awesome...!

156
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,510
What kind of kids are these?

157
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,850
You betcha! The descendents of Grandpa
Goku and Vegeta-san are fighting.

158
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,250
Even I'm excited about this!

159
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,100
You handle yourself pretty well, huh?

160
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,200
You're the first one that ever
made me go seriously against them.

161
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,100
That goes for me, too!

162
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,210
Whoa, this is a surprise!
You can turn blond, too?

163
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,550
This looks like it's going to
turn out to be a good match!

164
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,110
Here goes!

165
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,780
Get him! Let him have it!
That's the way, Goku!

166
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,190
Go! Goku!

167
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,840
Grandpa?

168
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,930
Excuse me, let me pass!
I beg your pardon!

169
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,530
Look! That boy over there won!

170
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,810
You came, didn't you, Grandpa Goku?

171
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:35,200
{\a6}DAN DAN, little by little, I'm being
charmed by your dazzling, smiling face.

172
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,200
Because of you, Goku, it has been fun.

173
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,870
{\a6}Let us spring out from
this endless darkness.

174
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:46,310
{\a6}Hold my hand.

175
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,480
{\a6}When I first came across you,

176
00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:02,830
{\a6}I recalled a place that,
when I was a child, I held dear.

177
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:11,840
{\a6}Won't you dance with me, on the
Winding Road of light and shadow?

178
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,840
{\a6}Even now, are you lost
in thought over him?

179
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:24,520
{\a6}There are times when I get so that I
want to look back, just a little bit,

180
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:32,520
{\a6}but holding on to love,
courage and pride, I fight on!

181
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,190
{\a6}DAN DAN, little by little,
I'm being charmed,

182
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,200
{\a6}this planet's last remnant of hope.

183
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:46,870
{\a6}Surely anyone would want
to take eternity in hand.

184
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,540
{\a6}ZEN ZEN, even though I act
like I don't care at all,

185
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,810
{\a6}look at me, I'm in love with you!

186
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:00,480
{\a6}Let us spring out from
this endless darkness.

187
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,290
{\a6}Hold your hand.

188
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:38,520
{\a6}I like you, even when you're tired,
or wearing an angry face,

189
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,200
{\a6}but I wonder if you're okay,
living as hurried as you are.

190
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:53,140
{\a6}Here I am, twisted around by your
indifferent manner, feeling Sea Side Blue.

191
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,480
{\a6}Even so, are you lost
in thought over him?

192
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,810
{\a6}There are still other things
I wanted to ask you,

193
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:08,150
{\a6}but our dialogue is drowned
out by the sound of the car,

194
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,820
{\a6}and drifts out into the street.

195
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:21,500
{\a6}DAN DAN, little by little, I'm being
charmed, it's strange, even to me,

196
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:28,170
{\a6}how when anything comes up,
I want to call you right away.

197
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,510
{\a6}ZEN ZEN, even though I act
like I don't care at all,

198
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,850
Goofy and cheerful...

199
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,840
{\a6}ZEN ZEN, even though I act
like I don't care at all,

200
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,850
{\a6}in the end, you're the
only one I ever saw.

201
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,850
Yoo-hoo!

202
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,850
{\a6}Let's spring out
toward the distant sea.

203
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,850
and gentle...

204
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,850
{\a6}Let's spring out
toward the distant sea.

205
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:47,310
{\a6}Hold your hand.

206
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,200
{\a6}DAN DAN, little by little,
I'm being charmed,

207
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,210
{\a6}this planet's last remnant of hope.

208
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,540
{\a6}Surely anyone would want
to take eternity in hand.

209
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,550
That's the Goku we all loved.

210
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,880
{\a6}Surely anyone would want
to take eternity in hand.

211
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,550
{\a6}ZEN ZEN, even though I act
like I don't care at all,

212
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,550
{\a6}look at me, I'm
in love with you!

213
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:21,560
This is where the story of Dragon Ball ends.

214
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,550
{\a6}look at me, I'm
in love with you!

215
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:21,560
{\a6}Let us spring out from
this endless darkness.

216
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:27,500
{\a6}Hold my hand.
