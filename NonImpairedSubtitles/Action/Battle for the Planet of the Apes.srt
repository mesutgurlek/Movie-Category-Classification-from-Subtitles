1
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:14,358
In the beginning,
God created beast and man

2
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:17,029
so that both might live
in friendship

3
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:21,268
and share dominion
over a world at peace.

4
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:27,372
But in the fullness of time,
evil men betrayed God's trust,

5
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:29,541
and in disobedience
to His holy word

6
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:32,051
waged bloody wars,

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,883
not only
against theirown kind,

8
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:41,054
but against the apes,
whom they reduced to slavery..

9
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,861
Then God, in His wrath,
sent the world a savior,

10
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:48,697
miraculously born of two apes,

11
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:53,604
who descended on Earth
from Earth's own future.

12
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:55,801
And man was afraid,

13
00:00:55,876 --> 00:01:00,108
for both parent apes possessed
the power of speech.

14
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,705
Come on!

15
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:18,131
Cornelius!

16
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:36,047
[Gunfire]

17
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:58,367
so both were brutally murdered.

18
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,931
But the child ape survived

19
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,706
and grew up to
set his fellow creatures free

20
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,011
from the yoke
of human slavery..

21
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,675
Do.

22
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:18,589
No!

23
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:03,463
Yet in the aftermath
of this victory.,

24
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:06,091
the surface of the world
was ravaged

25
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:10,695
by the vilest war
in human history..

26
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:12,796
The great cities of the world
split as under

27
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,807
and were flattened.

28
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,309
And out of one such city,

29
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:21,314
our savior led a remnant
of those who survived

30
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:24,112
in search of green erpastures,

31
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:28,315
where ape and human might
forever live in friendship

32
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,325
according to divine will.

33
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:35,487
His name was Caesar,

34
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:40,796
and this is hisstory.
in those far-off days.

35
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,493
You'll never
make it,Jake.

36
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,557
Nah, we'll make it.

37
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,903
I'll show you how.

38
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,681
Thanks, Aldo.

39
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,694
You will call me by
my proper rank--General!

40
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,522
Yes, General.

41
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,227
Don't put him
in the corral.

42
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,634
I won't be long.

43
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,468
Ape shall never kill ape.

44
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,635
Ape shall never kill ape.

45
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,975
Ape shall never kill ape.

46
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,980
Ape shall never kill ape.

47
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,313
Shall ape
ever kill man?

48
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,282
You're late, General Aldo.

49
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,619
Come and read this
to the class.

50
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,715
I won't.

51
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,454
You won't
because you can't,

52
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,488
and you can't because
you don't want to learn,

53
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,830
and it is my duty to
report this to Caesar.

54
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,233
[Growls]

55
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,101
If my father
were a gorilla,

56
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:35,540
we'd be learning
riding instead ofwriting.

57
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,236
[Laughter]

58
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,012
Silence.

59
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,507
Silence.

60
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:49,545
Cornelius, you are
Caesar's son and heir.

61
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:53,081
Being a good rider isn't enough
for being a good ruler,

62
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,185
though in human history,

63
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,696
quite a number
of military dictators

64
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,357
seem to have thought so.

65
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,866
Now, all of you take up

66
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,232
your charcoal sticks
and your parchments

67
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:04,794
and copy down
what I've written.

68
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,841
The best shall be hung
from these hooks.

69
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:11,105
I can think of better things
to hang from those hooks.

70
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,846
But, Virgil, can we
tamper with time?

71
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,610
- Accept my premise.
-What premise?

72
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:20,017
That since man once learned
to travel faster than sound,

73
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,317
he could later have learned
to travel faster than light.

74
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,016
We accept.

75
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,218
Imagine a musician
giving a live broadcast

76
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,557
from what was once London
to what was once New York

77
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,755
on a Wednesday.

78
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,764
He then travels
faster than light

79
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,527
from London to New York,

80
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:36,331
where he arrives--as
physicists would confirm--

81
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,631
on the previous Tuesday,

82
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,173
Iistens to his own
broadcast on the Wednesday,

83
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,539
dislikes
its quality intensely,

84
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,408
then travels back
faster than light to London

85
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,915
in time for him to decide
not to give his broadcast.

86
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,975
Come. I'll prove it
to you logically.

87
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,684
Good, Cornelius,

88
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,284
butyou've made
a mistake here.

89
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:02,727
You have put a " B"

90
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,991
in place of
the second " P".

91
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,932
Teacher, have you
forgotten your own name?

92
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,167
Everyone has always called me
teacher that I had forgotten.

93
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,674
"Ape shall never
kill Abe."

94
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,176
Thank you, Cornelius.

95
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,303
That was a very kind thought.

96
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,848
Gorillas.
All right, Aldo,

97
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,213
Iet's start with you.

98
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,955
General Aldo.

99
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,490
With respect,
General Aldo,

100
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,998
this is barely legible

101
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,591
and will have to
be written again.

102
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:46,003
Your capital "A" Ieans over
like a tent in a high wind.

103
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,473
Ha ha ha!

104
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,478
And your capital " K"...

105
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:58,947
"Ape shall never
kill Abe."

106
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,044
No, Aldo! No!

107
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,186
Teacher!

108
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:10,662
Teacher, you've spoken
the unspeakable.

109
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,892
I n all ouryears
of slavery to mankind,

110
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,194
the word " no"
was the one word

111
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,895
we were electrically
conditioned to fear.

112
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,699
Caesar has forbidden you
its utterance in perpetuity.

113
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,763
An ape may say no
to a human,

114
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,709
but a human may never
again say no to an ape.

115
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,177
Tell him you're sorry,
Abe, and go home

116
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,713
while you've still
got a home to go to.

117
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,908
I'll put in a good word
foryou with Caesar.

118
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:39,752
General Aldo,
I'm sorry.

119
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,818
The writing you destroyed
was by Caesar's son.

120
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,863
I did not want you to
suffer Caesar's anger!

121
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,694
What do I care
for Caesar's anger?

122
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,166
Let me give you
a taste of mine!

123
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,354
Grab him!

124
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,451
Stop, teacher!
Grab him!

125
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:15,961
Stop!

126
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,971
Grab him.
Grab the teacher!

127
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,315
Stop!

128
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:40,444
Stop!

129
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:43,490
We'll teach the
teacher a lesson.

130
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,526
Throw him in the corral,
where all humans belong.

131
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,325
I said stop, Aldo.

132
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,765
He broke the law.

133
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,429
With his own mouth,
he broke the first law.

134
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,371
I am the law.
What has he done?

135
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:04,138
Caesar, I was there.

136
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,203
Teacher only reverted
to type under provocation.

137
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,444
He spoke like a slave master
in the old days of our servitude.

138
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,385
When we were conditioned
to mechanical obedience.

139
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:16,980
He uttered
a negative imperative.

140
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,082
Could you put that
into words

141
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,184
which even Caesar
could understand?

142
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:25,664
Um, he said,
" No, Aldo. No."

143
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,324
[Grunts]

144
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,868
The schoolroom
was wrecked.

145
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,369
The class is ended.

The schoolroom
is closed!

Now we'll go back
to riding horses!

Aldo!

You and your friends

150
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,246
will return
to the schoolroom

151
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:45,285
and put it back
in order.

Abe, no gorilla
is to be dismissed

153
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,957
until everything
is back in its place.

154
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,458
Yes, Caesar.

155
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:56,291
Father, since there won't be
any more school today,

156
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,456
may I go out
and play?

157
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:01,467
Can't you study
in the house?

158
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:03,330
I could,
Father, but...

159
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:05,955
Run along and play.

160
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,335
Where are
my students?

161

I wasjust
in the midst

of explaining my theory
of time relativity.

163
00:15:13,908 --> 00:15:16,206
If Caesar permits,
I would like my--

164
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:18,006
Caesar permits.

165
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:21,280
You look concerned,
MacDonald.

166
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:22,713
I am, Caesar.

167
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,717
I think
that Aldo's hatred

168
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,719
is not confined
to humans.

169
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:31,224
Look out!

170
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:44,868
I think Aldo may be
riding for a fall.

171
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,405
If only my mother
and father,

172
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:51,877
whom I was too
young to remember,

173
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:53,379
if only
they'd lived,

174
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:55,381
perhaps they would
have taught me

175
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:58,247
if it was right
to kill evil

176
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:00,879
so that good
should prevail.

177
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:03,890
But you know,
Caesar, history shows--

178
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,325
oh, no, no, no.
That is human history,

179
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:08,918
not ape history.

180
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:11,396
Ape never kills ape.

181
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,560
oh, here's the list

182
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:18,571
of our winter
supplies so far.

183
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,731
I've got to be
getting along.

184
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:21,741
I'm starving.
I could eat a horse.

185
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,640
A horse?

186
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:25,611
oh, you remember Lisa.

187
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,941
They used to eat
lots of things--

188
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:29,847
dead cattle, dead chickens,
dead pigs.

189
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,579
Now we live
and chew nuts

190
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:35,121
at our master's
command.

191
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:37,817
That will be all,
J ulie.

192
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:39,325
Thank you.

193
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,827
We are not
your masters.

194
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,696
We're not
your equals.

195
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:51,838
MacDonald, I believe that

196
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:55,535
when you truly grow to know
and trust a person,

197
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,338
you cannot help
but like him.

198
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:00,574
When we grow to know
and trust your people,

199
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:02,843
then we shall
all be equals

200
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,977
and remain so until
the end of the world.

201
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:08,044
Which may be sooner
than you think.

202
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:09,521
You are such a pessimist!

203
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,057
or a prophet.

204
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,491
Now that apes
are at the helm,

205
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:15,995
the Earth will sail
safely through space

206
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:17,087
until the end of time,

207
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:20,099
and Virgil says
time has no end,

208
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:22,294
so you see
I cannot believe you.

209
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,338
Would you believe it
if you heard it

210
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:28,603
from the lips
of your own parents?

211
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,007
Are my parents alive?

212
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,038
No, but their images
and their voices are.

213
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:39,142
MacDonald, when you talk
about my parents,

214
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,518
please do not speak
in riddles.

215
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:42,954
I cannot see them.
I cannot hear them.

216
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:44,991
They came out
of the future.

217
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,289
They cannot
give me knowledge.

218
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:51,161
Caesar,
you can see them.

219
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,166
You can hear them,

220
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,668
and they can
give you knowledge.

221
00:17:55,736 --> 00:17:57,101
How?

222
00:17:57,171 --> 00:18:00,163
Under the dead city
where we once lived

223
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:03,176
in the archives near
the old command post,

224
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:05,678
there are tapes--
sealed tapes--

225
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:07,611
of Cornelius and Zira

226
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:10,878
being examined by officials
of the American government.

227
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:12,782
When my brother was
Governor Breck's assistant,

228
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:14,184
he told me about them.

229
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:17,156
I know where they are,

230
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:19,158
and I know that they
concern Earth's future,

231
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:20,591
from which
your parents came.

232
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:22,856
But the city
was flattened.

233
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,864
The bomb left nothing.

234
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:27,196
Except, I suspect...

235
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:29,361
the archive section.

236
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:31,870
I ndeed, many sections
of the underground city

237
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:34,430
were designed
to survive the impact

238
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,476
of a 1 0-megaton overblast.

239
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:38,773
Well, then the tapes and
pictures of my parents--

240
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:41,440
Are still down there.

241
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:43,642
ohh...

242
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:45,651
oh, MacDonald.

243
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:48,654
I want to see
what they look like.

244
00:18:48,722 --> 00:18:51,987
I suppose
every orphan does.

245
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,153
I want to hear

246
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:57,663
what they thought
and knew.

247
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,327
The city's radioactive.

248
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:07,169
oh, yeah, well...
Iet me see.

249
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:10,176
Who is there
among your people

250
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:12,678
who knows something
about radioactivity?

251
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:14,179
No one.

252
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:17,516
And among mine?

253
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:23,621
Who knows everything
about everything?

254
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,753
oh...
oh, Virgil.

255
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,025
Go find him.

256
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:36,861
Lisa, you remember
your parents.

257
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:40,566
I was too young when
they died to remember mine.

258
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:43,576
I don't want to have
to remember my husband.

259
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:45,077
I want to
love him now.

260
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:47,773
Well, Virgil
will be with us.

261
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:51,079
Now, we'll take good care.

262
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,584
Say good-bye
to Cornelius.

263
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:55,588
I don't want him
to know I'm afraid.

264
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,459
Cornelius.

265
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:07,259
Cornelius.

266
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,432
Cornelius.

267
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:15,607
Father.

268
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:19,612
I'm going
on a journey.

269
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,945
What will you
bring me back?

270
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:24,745
What would you like?

271
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:29,822
More nuts
for my squirrel.

272
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,323
He's growing fast.

273
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:33,326
So are you.

274
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:39,563
one day, you will be
as tall as a king.

275
00:20:45,472 --> 00:20:46,530
Mandemus.

276
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:49,107
He's asleep.

277
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:51,110
Not eternally,
I trust.

278
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:52,702
Mandemus.

279
00:20:54,915 --> 00:20:55,847
Who's there?

280
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,076
Caesar.

281
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:07,259
What does
Caesar want?

282
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,760
Weapons.

283
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:10,763
For what purpose?

284
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:12,264
For self-protection

285
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:14,459
in the pursuit
of knowledge.

286
00:21:14,535 --> 00:21:16,469
Self-protection
against whom or what?

287
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:18,471
We don't know.

288
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,167
Well, then what is the point
of protecting yourself

289
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:23,869
against a danger ofwhich
you have no knowledge

290
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:26,674
in pursuit of a knowledge
you do not possess?

291
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,544
oh, God.

292
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,185
Is it a knowledge
for good or evil?

293
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:35,585
All knowledge
is for good.

294
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:38,955
only the use to which you
put it can be good or evil.

295
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:40,459
Well put.

296
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:41,585
Thank you.

297
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:43,721
The sun is rising.

298
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:46,994
I should like to get this
matter settled before it sets.

299
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,058
Caesar has appointed me

300
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:51,036
not only as the keeper
of this armory,

301
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:53,732
but as the keeper
of his own conscience.

302
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:57,299
That is why I have asked
six boring questions

303
00:21:57,377 --> 00:21:59,368
and now propose
to ask a seventh

304
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:03,815
before issuing or not issuing
the weapons you require.

305
00:22:03,884 --> 00:22:05,317
What is the nature
of the knowledge

306
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:08,354
you cannot seek
without weapons?

307
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:10,185
The knowledge of
Earth's ultimate fate

308
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:11,690
recorded on tapes

309
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:13,419
in the archives of
the forbidden city...

310
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:15,428
Which is
contaminated,

311
00:22:15,496 --> 00:22:18,932
but still may be
inhabited by humans.

312
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,523
Hmm. Come in.

313
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:27,940
Name your
protective pick.

314
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:29,942
Three submachine guns.

315
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,977
For?

316
00:22:31,044 --> 00:22:33,142
The removal
of obstacles.

317
00:22:33,276 --> 00:22:34,800
Hmm.

318
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:37,539
1 ...

319
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:40,815
2...

320
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:43,818
3.

321
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:45,320
Now what?

322
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:46,821
Ammunition.

323
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,826
I really don't hold
with knowing the future,

324
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:53,829
even my own
which is short.

325
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:55,330
A geiger counter.

326
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:58,333
I mean, ifwe knew for a fact
there was an afterlife,

327
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:00,426
and that the afterlife
was bliss eternal,

328
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:03,734
we'd all commit suicide in
order to be able to enjoy it.

329

493
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,690
Is there
another way?

494
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,532
They got past you?
Then shoot on sight.

495
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,534
Never mind about
bringing them here.

496
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:02,796
J ust get them.

497
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,600
Don't let anyone
escape alive!

498
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:09,870
Sections 2-5
and R-7 and 8,

499
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,535
form a group here.
Quick! Quick!

500
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,409
All right, move out!

501
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,880
Move! Move! Move!

502
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,382
Hurry!

503
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:18,884
Run!

504
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:20,385
Run!

505
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:24,991
I've got your guns.

506
00:35:25,058 --> 00:35:26,992
We need another patrol.

507
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,459
Quickly, men.
Hurry. Hurry.

508
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:31,498
The rest of you go
to M-5.

509
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:33,726
What are you
waiting for?

510
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:36,998
To R-8,
through the transverse!

511
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:03,654
Aah!

512
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,139
All forces
into exit level 3.

513
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,941
They're getting away!
Kill them!

514
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:56,574
Kill them! Kill them!

515
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,811
[Gunshot]

516
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:06,459
You knew every bolt and nut
in those corridors.

517
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,432
You have 1 00 armed men.
How could they escape?

518
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:13,595
They were fast
and smart, Governor Kolp.

519
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:15,263
Many of my men
were sick,

520
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:17,671
and the chimp
surprised us.

521
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:20,972
Yeah. He surprised
me too, once,

522
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:23,809
But he's an animal.
He's only an animal.

523
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:24,813
No, Governor.

524
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:26,213
He's more
than an animal.

525
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:27,773
He can speak.

526
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:28,910
So can they all.

527
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:31,011
So speech
makes them human?

528
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,181
Speech makes them
intelligent,

529
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:36,658
and intelligence may make them
not human, but humane.

530
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,126
Perhaps they
came in peace.

531
00:40:38,195 --> 00:40:39,628
Idiot.
They were armed.

532
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:41,130
From what we saw
on the monitor,

533
00:40:41,198 --> 00:40:43,132
only for their
self-protection.

534
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,395
Let them
return in peace.

535
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:46,629
To where?

536
00:40:46,704 --> 00:40:48,035
To wherever they live.

537
00:40:48,105 --> 00:40:50,801
So they can return to
exterminate those of us

538
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,809
the bomb hasn't
already exterminated?

539
00:40:52,877 --> 00:40:54,071
Where do they live?

540
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:56,306
They came with
few provisions.

541
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,574
It can't be far.

542
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:58,774
Which way
did they head?

543
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:00,510
They headed north,
Governor.

544
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,983
organize
scout parties,

545
00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:04,043
assemble
workable equipment,

546
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:05,679
and follow them
to their camp.

547
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,691
Yes, Governor Kolp.

548
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:12,217
Why, Governor?

549
00:41:12,296 --> 00:41:15,754
So that we
can exterminate them.

550
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:24,307
Stop!
It's Caesar!

551
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:27,640
We should have
stayed in the city.

552
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:29,474
Visiting the city
is forbidden.

553
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:32,015
I know.
I forbade it.

554
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,276
Then why?

555
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,012
Aldo, if a king forbids his
subjects to wear a crown,

556
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:38,111
that doesn't mean
he can't wear one himself.

557
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:39,520
Caesar is Caesar.

558
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,717
He went to the city
for a reason.

559
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,817
What reason?

560
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:45,828
I went looking
for my past,

561
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:48,831
but I found our future.

562
00:41:48,899 --> 00:41:50,332
Explain!

563
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:52,835
You wouldn't understand.

564
00:41:52,903 --> 00:41:56,339
Aldo will make
the future--with this!

565
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:59,843
Well, then Aldo
may very soon

566
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,208
be in the past.

567
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:04,144
Hee hee.

568
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:05,648
Hee hee.

569
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,149
Hee hee.

570
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,412
Aah!

571
00:42:20,731 --> 00:42:22,164
Cornelius!

572
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:26,497
Cornelius,
are you all right?

573
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:30,035
No, Mother.
I'm just dead.

574
00:42:30,107 --> 00:42:31,972
Dead?

575
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:33,270
We were playing war.

576
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:35,278
War? Cornelius,
hasn't your father explained

577
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:37,780
that war is not a game?

578
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:39,816
Yes, Mother.

579
00:42:39,883 --> 00:42:42,374
Hasn't he also forbidden
you to play with guns?

580
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:43,852
Yes, Mother.

581
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:45,718
Then you'll stop it.

582
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:47,222
Yes, Mother.

583
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,725
Now, come along.
Father wants us.

584
00:44:11,909 --> 00:44:15,367
My friends,
I have convened

585
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:18,176
this extraordinary meeting
of the council

586
00:44:18,248 --> 00:44:19,943
in order that I may
report upon an action

587
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:23,180
which I deemed necessary:

588
00:44:23,253 --> 00:44:26,518
a reconnaissance expedition
to the forbidden city

589
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,855
with Virgil and MacDonald
as my aides.

590
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:32,555
Why MacDonald?
Why not a soldier?

591
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:34,824
Because we went in peace

592
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:37,059
to what we thought
would be a dead city.

593
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:39,364
But in case
there were some survivors,

594
00:44:39,436 --> 00:44:40,801
we took MacDonald with us

595
00:44:40,871 --> 00:44:42,498
so that he could parley
with them

596
00:44:42,573 --> 00:44:45,440
and secure permission
for our search.

597
00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:47,272
Survivors there are...

598
00:44:47,344 --> 00:44:49,039
maimed,

599
00:44:49,113 --> 00:44:51,104
mutated,

600
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:53,206
hostile,

601
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:55,148
and human.

602
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:57,084
Did the humans
followyou here?

603
00:44:57,154 --> 00:44:58,485
We saw no sign of it,

604
00:44:58,555 --> 00:45:00,580
but we must prepare
for the day

605
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,050
when they may
come out of the city,

606
00:45:02,184 --> 00:45:04,778
when they may come
to find us.

607
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:13,491
No humans in council!
No humans in council!

608
00:45:13,562 --> 00:45:15,120
- No!
- No!
- No!

609
00:45:15,197 --> 00:45:16,596
- No!
- No!

610
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:17,996
- No!
- No!
- No!

611
00:45:18,066 --> 00:45:20,000
- No!
- No!

612
00:45:20,068 --> 00:45:22,002
- No!
- No!

613
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,004
- No!
- No!

614
00:45:24,072 --> 00:45:26,802
- No!
- No!
- No!

615
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:27,967
Yes!

616
00:45:28,043 --> 00:45:30,170
They are here
because I sent for them.

617
00:45:30,245 --> 00:45:32,372
Now that we know the danger,

618
00:45:32,447 --> 00:45:34,415
we need their help
and their counsel.

619
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:36,747
- No!
- No!
- No!

620
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:38,309
Yes!

621
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:43,620
Come. We shall not sit
in council with humans.

622
00:45:56,205 --> 00:45:59,766
Now, let us
reason together

623
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:02,504
and make plans.

624
00:46:02,578 --> 00:46:04,603
Governor, somewhere
along the line of history,

625
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,649
this bloody chain reaction
has got to stop.

626
00:46:07,716 --> 00:46:11,015
A destroys B, B destroys C,
C destroys A

627
00:46:11,086 --> 00:46:13,748
and is destroyed
by D, who destroys E.

628
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:15,983
Before anyone knows
where they are,

629
00:46:16,058 --> 00:46:18,458
there won't be anyone left
to know anything anywhere.

630
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:21,553
Governor, the captain
has come back.

631
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,895
We found it, Governor.
We found Ape City.

632
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:25,934
Where?

633
00:46:29,004 --> 00:46:31,438
This is
a gorilla outpost.

634
00:46:31,506 --> 00:46:33,440
Below is a valley
with orchards and vineyards,

635
00:46:33,508 --> 00:46:34,600
enough to feed hundreds.

636
00:46:34,676 --> 00:46:35,768
Here is Ape City.

637
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:37,277
Was it very large?

638
00:46:37,346 --> 00:46:38,938
It is of a size we
can deal with, sir.

639
00:46:39,014 --> 00:46:40,106
Were you seen?

640
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:41,171
No, sir.

641
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,445
Caesar was too busy
with a council ofwar.

642
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:45,452
one day soon, they'll
be coming for us.

643
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,454
No. We're going
after them--now.

644
00:46:47,522 --> 00:46:48,887
Captain, you
have your orders.

645
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:53,461
Caesar, on the night
of the fires,

646
00:46:53,528 --> 00:46:56,190
you swore an oath
that in the future

647
00:46:56,265 --> 00:46:59,962
apes and humans would live
together in kindness and peace.

648
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:03,300
Why are you now making
every sort of preparation

649
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:04,304
to break that oath?

650
00:47:04,373 --> 00:47:07,706
Because unlike
the humans in our city,

651
00:47:07,776 --> 00:47:13,442
those in the
forbidden city are mad--

652
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:17,144
mad enough not to want
peace and friendship,

653
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:19,585
but enmity and war.

654
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:21,885
Did they tell you that?

655
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:23,288
oh, yes. Yes.

656
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:25,292

a chance to explain.

You were trespassing
on their territory.

00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:32,566
But, Lisa, we didn't know
the city was inhabited.

But how, if you
didn't speak to them,

661
00:47:36,405 --> 00:47:38,965
do you know its
inhabitants are mad?

Lisa, you
didn't see them.

They're...oh...
They're malformed.

foster father's circus?

Were they mad?

from Caesar

into the armory

You murdered my son.

997
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:01,168
You murdered my son!

998
01:22:05,574 --> 01:22:06,768
[Hiss]

999
01:22:11,713 --> 01:22:12,907
[Hiss]

1000
01:22:24,192 --> 01:22:25,750
Aah!

1001
01:22:37,038 --> 01:22:40,474
Should one murder
be avenged by another?

1002
01:22:40,542 --> 01:22:42,976
only the future
can tell.

1003
01:22:43,044 --> 01:22:46,070
So let us
start building it.

1004
01:23:13,141 --> 01:23:16,167
Ifwe appear to be lacking
in gratitude, Caesar,

1005
01:23:16,244 --> 01:23:19,179
what have we
to be grateful for?

1006
01:23:19,247 --> 01:23:20,737
If you mean
to set us free,

1007
01:23:20,816 --> 01:23:22,807
then free us
completely.

1008
01:23:22,884 --> 01:23:24,351
What do you mean?

1009
01:23:24,419 --> 01:23:27,582
We are not
your children, Caesar.

1010
01:23:27,656 --> 01:23:29,556
We have a destiny, too--

1011
01:23:29,624 --> 01:23:32,092
as equals,
respecting each other,

1012
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,889
Iiving together,
with love.

1013
01:23:33,962 --> 01:23:36,089
Love?

1014
01:23:36,164 --> 01:23:40,965
The human way
is violence and death.

1015
01:23:41,036 --> 01:23:45,632
Aldo wasn't human,
was he, Caesar?

1016
01:23:48,109 --> 01:23:49,667
Virgil...

1017
01:23:51,246 --> 01:23:55,342
you are
a good and wise ape.

1018
01:23:59,221 --> 01:24:03,885
And you, Caesar, are
a good and wise king.

1019
01:24:03,959 --> 01:24:07,725
We'll rebuild what's ruined
and begin again.

1020
01:24:07,796 --> 01:24:09,730
Tell me something,
MacDonald.

1021
01:24:09,798 --> 01:24:13,734
Can we make the future
what we wish?

1022
01:24:13,802 --> 01:24:16,737
I've heard that
it's possible, Caesar.

1023
01:24:23,345 --> 01:24:28,248
There. Every weapon
is back in its proper place.

1024
01:24:28,316 --> 01:24:31,444
Caesar, I want
to ask a favor.

1025
01:24:31,519 --> 01:24:34,044
This armory's been
my home for 27 years.

1026
01:24:34,122 --> 01:24:36,283
You may live in it for
the rest of your days.

1027
01:24:36,358 --> 01:24:38,417
But I don't want
to live in it.

1028
01:24:38,493 --> 01:24:41,485
No, no. Now that
the danger is over,

1029
01:24:41,563 --> 01:24:45,226
I want to see it
destroyed. Blown up.

1030
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:50,101
The greatest danger of all
is that danger never ends.

1031
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:53,607
And so, Mandemus,

1032
01:24:53,675 --> 01:24:57,270
we must be patient...
and wait.

1033
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:02,380
We still wait,
my children.

1034
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:05,544
But as I look at
apes and humans

1035
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:10,489
Iiving in friendship,
harmony, and at peace

1036
01:25:10,558 --> 01:25:14,324
now some 600 years
after Caesar's death,

1037
01:25:14,396 --> 01:25:17,627
at least we wait
with hope for the future.

1038
01:25:17,699 --> 01:25:20,759
Lawgiver, who knows
about the future?

1039
01:25:23,138 --> 01:25:26,403
Perhaps only the dead.
