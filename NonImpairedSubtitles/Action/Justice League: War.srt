1
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,639
New insight on the rash
of terrifying abductions

2
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,474
Plaguing Gotham City.

3
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:46,211
Warning, this footage may be too
mature for younger audiences.

4
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,280
Is this the mysterious batman

5
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:51,050
Who's been spotted in Gotham?

6
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,357
Uh, stop it, max.

7
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,525
Too scary.

8
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,460
I'm the batman, Charlie.

9
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:05,097
I've come to suck your blood.

10
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,666
Hey, come on!

11
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,701
Stop the bus, damn it!

12
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,806
Aah!

13
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,852
Going somewhere, buddy?

14
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,788
All right. You wanna dance?

15
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,857
Let's dance.

16
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,499
Your move, precious.

17
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,534
No! No, don't!

18
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,736
Crap.

19
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,611
Going up.

20
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,518
You saved me.

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,453
Sure did. The name's...

22
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,188
- What's the catch?
- What?

23
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,325
What's it gonna cost me?

24
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,427
You're welcome, lady.

25
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:11,396
And how am I supposed
to get down from here now?!

26
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,669
Now, where'd
my creepy-Crawly get to?

27
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,481
High-Tech armor, huh?

28
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,353
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

29
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,562
Ok, that was better.

30
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,169
What were you doing
at the docks?

31
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,904
I want answers.

32
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,663
Batman?

33
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,498
You're real?

34
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,567
Turn it off.

35
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,634
- I had him.
- Clearly.

36
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:25,971
Now turn off the damn light
before they see us.

37
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,439
Before who sees us?

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,341
This is Gotham P.D.

39
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:32,477
Put your hands in the air.
Put your hands in the air.

40
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,979
They don't like us much.

41
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,715
The world's afraid of us.

42
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,951
You say that
like it's a good thing.

43
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,319
It's necessary.

44
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,356
Move!

45
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,962
Take your glow stick
and go home.

46
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,830
Gotham's mine.

47
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,907
No, see, this entire
space sector is my beat.

48
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,775
Uh-Huh.

49
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,611
I'm serious!

50
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:07,980
I'm Green Lantern, damn it!

51
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,009
What the hell did you do?

52
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,844
Cool.

53
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,828
So what's it doing in Gotham?

54
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,797
Witnesses spotted this thing

55
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:32,898
Trying to plant
some kind of bomb downtown.

56
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,669
When the cops confronted it,
it spewed fire from its mouth.

57
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,873
Yeah, I noticed,
but fire's no problem for me.

58
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,410
As I was saying,
Green Lantern can do anything.

59
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,678
Except shut up, apparently.

60
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,716
Wow. Someone forgot to take
their tru blood tonight.

61
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,117
I'm not a vampire.

62
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,052
- Seriously?
- I thought with the darkness

63
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:58,090
And the vanishing,
then the, what, super strength?

64
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:59,624
No.

65
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,796
- Can you fly?
- In a plane.

66
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:10,502
Wait. You're not just some guy
in a bat costume, are you?

67
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,976
Are you freaking kidding me?

68
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,446
What? Nobody asked you to prom,

69
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,981
So now you dress as a bat

70
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,617
And prowl around
your parents' basement?

71
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,387
What's this do?

72
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,521
Huh?

73
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,156
No buttons.

74
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,624
I assume it works
off concentration.

75
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,660
How'd you do that?

76
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,030
You weren't concentrating.

77
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,035
- You won't do that again.
- Unless I want to.

78
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,439
- That's it.
- Let's rumba, spooky.

79
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,574
Unh!

80
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,145
Shh.

81
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,960
- Hold fast.
- We need more info.

82
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:14,099
Bullcrap. That's a bomb,
and he just armed it.

83
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,468
Lantern, wait!

84
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,571
For Darkseid.

85
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,683
- Dark side?
- Wh-What's that, a band?

86
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,151
Some kind of death cry.

87
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,854
It wanted to take us with it,

88
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,823
All to protect this.

89
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,057
I'm on it.

90
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,194
Ring, scan and identify.

91
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,897
Initiating scan.

92
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,699
Processing.

93
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,969
Unable to identify.

94
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,871
That's impossible.

95
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,939
The ring knows
what the guardians know,

96
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,508
And the guardians
know everything.

97
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,044
It doesn't scan like a bomb,

98
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,612
More like an alien computer.

99
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,815
- Alien?
- Like the guy in metropolis?

100
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,183
Superman.

101
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,751
You've met him?

102
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,153
No,

103
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,888
But I've researched him.

104
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,156
His powers levels are...

105
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,593
Not gonna be a problem for me.

106
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,595
We'll see.

107
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,730
In the meantime,

108
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:21,132
We need to know more
about this thing.

109
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,572
Nothing on the markings
or the design, Sarah?

110
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,007
No, dr. Stone.

111
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:29,775
Dozens of tests,

112
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,110
And we're still unable
to learn a single thing.

113
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,613
We know less now
than when the flash

114
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,581
Brought it to us days ago.

115
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:39,251
Maybe we'll catch a break
with the metal scan.

116
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:45,023
You've been working
around the clock on this, Silas.

117
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,658
Perhaps if you got some rest.

118
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,894
I'll rest when we know
what this device is

119
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:52,297
And why that creature needed it
planted in central city.

120
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,533
Now what do we know?

121
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,002
It's broadcasting
some kind of signal,

122
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,537
And we've tracked
similar signals

123
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,106
Emitting from coast city,
Gotham, and metropolis.

124
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:04,709
Then it's talking to someone.

125
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,113
I should take this.

126
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,848
- Hi there, dr. Stone.
- I figured I'd see

127
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,616
If you had any further
information regarding the device

128
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,585
And the organism I left with you
a few days ago.

129
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:17,055
- Slow down, son.
- I can barely understand you.

130
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,558
Yeah, I get that sometimes.

131
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,992
We lost the creature.

132
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,828
It seemed engineered
to fall apart.

133
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,930
I see.

134
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,064
Any further data on the device?

135
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,000
Nothing yet. I should
know more in a few hours.

136
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,603
All right,
I'll check back with you then.

137
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:34,005
Flash, I can't help but suspect

138
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,041
I'm speaking
to a fellow scientist.

139
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:40,011
I'll catch up with you later,
dr. Stone.

140
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,347
Burritos are here!

141
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,683
- Hey!
- Can't even do that quickly.

142
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,885
- Where's my extra salsa?
- Finally.

143
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,653
'Bout time.

144
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:52,057
Way to take the "fast"
out of fast food, Barry.

145
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,127
Hey, guys,
someone took mine by mistake.

146
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,162
Chimichanga?

147
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,131
Guys?

148
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:30,161
- Tickets.
- Let's see your tickets.

149
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,035
My dad's got the tickets.

150
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,170
You mean your granddad?

151
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,641
Uh, yeah. What'd I say?

152
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,780
And one for your grandson?

153
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,915
What?

154
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,418
Hey!

155
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,663
Yeah!

156
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,832
Big man, you all right?

157
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,434
What's the play, Vic?

158
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,403
Here's what we're gonna do.

159
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,904
Gun, dice, right yo-yo.

160
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,907
Scat right "y" option on hard.

161
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,442
Break!

162
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,988
Admiral, admiral,

163
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,022
Check brown ox.

164
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,693
30 buffalo. River.

165
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,363
Red 98. Hut, hut!

166
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,492
Ha ha ha ha!

167
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,195
Next stop, nationals!

168
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,966
Ha ha! Vic stone is the bomb!

169
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,817
These freaks cost America

170
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:36,154
Over $100 million
in property damage.

171
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,489
Who's gonna pay for that?

172
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:41,059
Us regular people, that's who.

173
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,428
Diana, wait.

174
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,365
- It's Wonder Woman.
- It's her.

175
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,034
- In the flesh.
- Someone do something.

176
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:50,503
Oh, great.

177
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,537
I am Diana of paradise island.

178
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,172
Tell me who you speak of,

179
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:58,042
And, by Zeus,
they will taste my steel.

180
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,084
You gather to protest...

181
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,852
me?

182
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,793
You, what is
your problem with me?

183
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,294
You want the truth?

184
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,930
You swing that sword
with a smile,

185
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,498
And you scare normal people,

186
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,400
And you dress like a whore.

187
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,069
Yeah, he's right.

188
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,908
- He's right.
- Yeah.

189
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,510
Wha?!

190
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,346
This is not your truth.

191
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,282
The lasso compels you.

192
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,250
Now tell us your truth.

193
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:42,453
I cross-Dress
in a Wonder Woman outfit.

194
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,123
It makes me feel powerful.

195
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,231
Embrace your truth, my friend.

196
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,034
My outfit makes me
feel powerful, too.

197
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,435
We better get going.

198
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:01,372
Yes, off to see
this president you speak of.

199
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,444
Dad, it's just me.

200
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,012
Hey, I know how busy you are.

201
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,850
I just really thought you'd
keep your promise this time.

202
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,418
By the way, we won tonight.

203
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,054
Talk to you later. Love you.

204
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,858
Played a hell of game
today, victory.

205
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,993
- We're grabbing a slice.
- You down?

206
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,029
Nah. I gotta go see my dad.

207
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,543
Hey, you were in my dad's seat.

208
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:42,080
Didn't look like
he was using it.

209
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,251
You see a kid run through here?

210
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,561
Humph.

211
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,297
Thanks for that.

212
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,664
Yeah, don't sweat it.

213
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,065
Awesome game today.

214
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,667
Superstar Q.B. Victory stone

215
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,270
Brings in the win
single-Handedly.

216
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,371
Nah, not quite.

217
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,941
What do you mean? You threw
that last touchdown pass,

218
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:10,476
Like, 43 yards.

219
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,377
Doesn't matter
if there's not someone

220
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,446
On the other end
to make the catch.

221
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:20,351
Must be nice to trust
someone else that much.

222
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,191
Hey, I should go.

223
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,626
Nice meeting you, victory.

224
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,429
Tell your dad
he's got some great seats.

225
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,064
Yeah, I will.

226
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,470
Hey, where's my...

227
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,605
Son of a...

228
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,340
yes!

229
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,378
Victory! Victory!

230
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,285
Superman's close.

231
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,254
I've been tracking
his flight path.

232
00:15:56,256 --> 00:16:00,224
On what, your own satellite?

233
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,662
I was kidding.
You have a satellite?

234
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,597
Here he comes.

235
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,239
First one to the building is...

236
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,711
Uhh. I really hate that guy.

237
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,556
Wait here.

238
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,524
I got this.

239
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,293
No offense.

240
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,027
You'd just get in the way.

241
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:36,662
Here's the plan.

242
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,564
Green Lantern
kicks Superman's ass.

243
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,033
Tmz's got the video.

244
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,613
Aah!

245
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,723
So what can you do?

246
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,471
I can still see you.

247
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:29,080
The creature that attacked me
had one of those boxes you have.

248
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,085
A friend of yours, I assume.

249
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,358
He blew up,

250
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,260
So I'll ask you.

251
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,292
What are these boxes for?

252
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,627
Talk while you still can.

253
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:20,098
Trying to.

254
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,366
Round 2, flyboy.

255
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,574
Lantern, no!

256
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,217
Chains?

257
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,617
You're funny.

258
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:46,658
We won't stop him.

259
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,794
He's pissed off.
We have to talk to him.

260
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,429
Talk to him?

261
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,618
Lantern, focus.

262
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,786
You stop concentrating,
and that shield breaks apart.

263
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,688
Shut up.

264
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:28,933
This guy's gonna kill us.

265
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:32,737
- No, he won't.
- You bruise, but you don't kill,

266
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,305
Do you...

267
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,374
Clark?

268
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,579
You've made your point...

269
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,415
Heh. Bruce Wayne.

270
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,784
Who the hell is Bruce Wayne?

271
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,586
We think it's alien.

272
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,322
Well, it's not kryptonian.

273
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:51,857
Worth a shot.

274
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,792
- Hey, hey, what happened?
- We're done fighting?

275
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,894
Alien is relative, by the way.

276
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,763
It's a big universe.

277
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,735
Let's move.

278
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,440
Man, what is it
with you and sewers?

279
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,610
Someone is strategically placing
these boxes.

280
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:17,782
We have to find out who
and why before it's too late.

281
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:30,261
Desaad,
what do you have to report

282
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,529
From our agents on earth?

283
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:35,800
Sire, the powerful one
has found a mother box,

284
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:40,371
The one they
mistakenly call Superman.

285
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,939
And?

286
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,342
These defenders have
sprung up like antibodies

287
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,845
To protect their planet.
We are in danger of losing

288
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,580
The element of surprise,
my lord.

289
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,784
I humbly ask that you
move up your timetable.

290
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,588
Let the invasion begin.

291
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,693
We're maxed at power ceiling.

292
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,462
Cycle the pulses.

293
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,566
Dr. Stone,

294
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,334
Your son is here.

295
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,837
- I don't have time right now.
- Do it again.

296
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:13,505
Make time.

297
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,773
Victor, I'm in the middle

298
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,341
Of some very important work.

299
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,644
You mean
more important than me.

300
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,879
That's not what I said.

301
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,415
There were scouts there
today, dad.

302
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,451
They offered me a full ride,
all of them.

303
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,453
I told you
I'll pay for college.

304
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,889
You don't need to be sniffing
after a scholarship.

305
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:32,923
That's not the point.

306
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:37,862
They think I can hold my own
with the best of the best.

307
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:39,664
Why don't you?

308
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,365
Open your eyes, son.

309
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,367
Look at the world
we live in today.

310
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,871
We are witnessing the birth
of a new race of Superhumans,

311
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:49,774
Beings who can fly,
tear through buildings,

312
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,709
And outrun race cars.

313
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,644
They will make
what you can do obsolete.

314
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:58,082
In that world,
throwing a football is a joke.

315
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,620
You're never gonna come
to one of my games, are you?

316
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,791
No.

317
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:08,326
Dr. Stone,
something's happening.

318
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,062
We can talk about this later.

319
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,804
- So why are you two here?
- Metropolis is my turf.

320
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:24,942
There have been reports of mysterious
kidnappings across the country.

321
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:25,911
We had 'em here, too.

322
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,712
Figured that was life
in the big city.

323
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:30,915
You think the disappearances
and these things are connected?

324
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,350
They're connected.

325
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,818
So these monsters, they're...

326
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,620
they're soldiers,
expendable soldiers at that,

327
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,056
Planting these devices
at all costs.

328
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,058
That's military tactics.

329
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,693
We might be
staring down the barrel

330
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,028
Of a full-Scale invasion.

331
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,863
You're paranoid.

332
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,933
Let's just crack it open
and see what happens.

333
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:49,468
Hey!

334
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:52,103
Without any idea what's inside?

335
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,738
That's idiotic.

336
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,407
Heh. I'll show you idiotic.

337
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,477
Ahh! I didn't touch it.

338
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,612
It's activated itself.

339
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:02,847
It's transmitting.

340
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,482
Silas, look at these readings.

341
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:07,885
I am not letting you
walk away from me again, dad.

342
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,820
We're having this out.

343
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,054
Can we trace the power source?

344
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,157
I'm trying to lock in
on the signal now.

345
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,060
This thing
is more important to you

346
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,628
Than your own son?

347
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,463
Victor, stop!

348
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,069
It's gonna blow!

349
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,809
Aah!

350
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,941
You're welcome.

351
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,964
Still think I'm paranoid?

352
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,100
Ah, maybe a little less now.

353
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,499
We need to get out of here now.

354
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:01,967
Which way?

355
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:05,636
We have to get him
into the red room.

356
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,554
Sarah!

357
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,805
I'm not leaving you, victor.

358
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,542
Don't you dare leave me.

359
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:54,986
I don't believe it.

360
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:58,289
His vitals are there, Silas.
He's alive.

361
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:04,896
Dad.

362
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,797
Yes, victor. I'm here.

363
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,633
Ahh. It hurts so bad.

364
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:10,734
It's going to hurt.

365
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,270
It's not gonna be easy, but...

366
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:15,807
Whatever that energy is,

367
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:18,008
It's eating him
from the inside out.

368
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,644
He's going into cardiac arrest.

369
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,080
It's racing up his spinal cord.

370
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,149
Then we can't wait.

371
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:31,989
But, Silas, the risk.

372
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:33,023
What choice so I have, morrow?

373
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:35,926
This room contains technology
recovered from across the globe.

374
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,262
I've studied and logged
nearly everything in here.

375
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,864
I've taken apart
and rebuilt most of it.

376
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,200
It can save my son's life.

377
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,768
It has to.

378
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,924
- He's in pain.
- You have to do something.

379
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,660
The pain will subside
as soon as the promethium

380
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,228
Finishes replacing
the damaged tissue.

381
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,696
Promethium skin grafts?

382
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:15,132
His body could
reject them completely.

383
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:15,867
It won't.

384
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,968
I've injected the nanites.
Activate them.

385
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,638
- They're untested.
- We recovered them from...

386
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,272
Do it!

387
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,848
Aah!

388
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:59,209
Out of the way,
you freaky bimbo!

389
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:02,146
Cool. You're Wonder Woman.

390
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,281
My name is Diana.

391
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,150
Mine's Hannah grace.

392
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,852
Thank you for speaking
with me, Hannah.

393
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,154
You're not afraid of me.

394
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:13,357
Nah. I wanna be you
when I get big.

395
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,727
I would welcome
your sisterhood, Hannah.

396
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:18,128
What are you eating?

397
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,164
Ice cream.

398
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,399
Is it good?

399
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,334
It's the greatest food
in the world,

400
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,470
If you ask me.

401
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,106
Aww.

402
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,875
I will try some ice cream,

403
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,345
And another
for my friend Hannah.

404
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:36,848
Whatever you say, lady.

405
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:40,951
Just don't, you know,
take my arm with it.

406
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,986
Eh, here.

407
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:51,095
Ice cream is wonderful!

408
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,231
Told you so.

409
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:58,736
You should be very proud
of this achievement.

410
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,405
Um, thanks?

411
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,443
I lost him.

412
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:09,947
I promised his mother
I'd protect him,

413
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:12,349
But I failed.

414
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,855
What's going on?

415
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,909
Diana.

416
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:42,146
Steve, have you
ever had ice cream?

417
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:45,282
This cook is truly blessed.

418
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,051
You need to come back
to the white house.

419
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:48,987
You sound like my mother.

420
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:51,488
The president only has
a few minutes to meet you.

421
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,892
I grew weary of waiting
for him, so I left.

422
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,326
This is Hannah.

423
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,295
Very pleased to meet you.

424
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,564
Could you excuse us, Hannah?

425
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:03,267
You can't walk out
like that, Diana.

426
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,935
You're a political envoy.

427
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:07,504
I am a warrior.

428
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,473
With responsibilities.

429
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:10,507
Besides, I happen to know

430
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:14,144
Where they make the best
homemade ice cream in D.C.,

431
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,046
If you're interested.

432
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:19,883
Oh. I could compel you
to disclose this secret.

433
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:23,053
Or I could just take you there.

434
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,400
There is
my true responsibility,

435
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:40,370
Combat. Leave them to me.

436
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,606
Upload initiated.

437
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:16,940
Completed.

438
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,508
Recalibrating memory.

439
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:24,114
What's happening?

440
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,382
Stay calm, son.

441
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,217
It's gonna be all right.

442
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,126
- Hey, dr. Stone. I...
- We're in trouble!

443
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,694
Offensive mode activated.

444
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,420
Aah!

445
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,164
Victor!

446
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,105
I came as quick as I could.

447
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:32,309
Offensive mode...
White noise cannon enabled.

448
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,677
Lantern, plug that hole.

449
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,313
Yeah, yeah. I got this.

450
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,762
Concentrate.

451
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,831
Your constructs are fading.

452
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,566
Your mind is scattered.

453
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,068
Worry about yourself.

454
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,603
You're the one without powers.

455
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,140
We need to take a step back
and regroup.

456
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:40,444
There's too many of them
just to barrel through.

457
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,778
Yeah?

458
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,716
Tell that to Superman. Ohh!

459
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,158
Come on.

460
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,726
That's it.

461
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,862
Smile for me.

462
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:12,876
- Mayday. Mayday.
- The capital is under attack.

463
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,215
And there goes our big gun.

464
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:20,617
Fantãstico.

465
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,295
Aw, come on.

466
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,665
Can't a guy get any privacy?

467
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,467
Football. Told you so.

468
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,869
Well, we had to be certain.

469
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:41,838
I was so worried
about you, Billy.

470
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,908
- You don't have to be.
- For real.

471
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,543
I like your jersey.

472
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:47,911
Oh, yeah? I stole it.

473
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:50,180
You did not. You're funny.

474
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:52,582
We worry
every time you disappear,

475
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:55,819
You know, like a family would.

476
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:58,355
Foster family.

477
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,459
This time was the worst.

478
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:05,595
You've heard the reports, right?

479
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,932
There's an invasion of monsters.

480
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:12,402
They're grabbing people
off the streets.

481
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,274
And you morons believe that?

482
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,944
Jerk.

483
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:41,464
Come and get some, ugly.

484
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:42,966
Shazam!

485
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,394
They're being
overcautious, hon.

486
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,697
We'll be fine.

487
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,806
I need eyes up, pronto.

488
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:36,686
We're under siege.

489
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:40,357
Repeat, the president
is under siege.

490
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,026
Aah!

491
00:37:58,709 --> 00:37:59,876
Mr. President.

492
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,512
It's nice to finally meet you.

493
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:05,348
I am Diana.
But you may call me...

494
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,318
Wonder woman. Thank goodness.

495
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,953
We've lost an engine!

496
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,724
Julian!

497
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:49,759
Aah!

498
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,716
Are we ok? What's going on?

499
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,787
By the gods.

500
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,400
You're strong.

501
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:32,902
I know.

502
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,012
Can't feel my hand.

503
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,515
Can't feel anything.

504
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,018
What's happened to me?

505
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:54,057
Your mind is now
a quantum computer, son.

506
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,493
There's buzzing in my ears.

507
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:58,895
Make it stop, please.

508
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,797
I can't.

509
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:01,731
At least you're alive.

510
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,701
Uhh. You call this living,

511
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:07,604
This half-Man, half-Machine?

512
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:10,940
This is what it took for you
to finally care about me?

513
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:15,512
You had to make me just
another one of your experiments.

514
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,582
Don't you hear the buzzing?

515
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,454
- You know what?
- I think I am needed downtown,

516
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:28,691
And you two clearly
need to talk, so I'll just,

517
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,561
Uh... Yeah.

518
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,039
Unassimilated data detected.

519
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,042
Commencing
parademon indoctrination.

520
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,912
Download initiated.

521
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,453
Translating. Command...

522
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:59,055
Locate inhabitable worlds.

523
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:10,200
Command...
Harvest organic material.

524
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,841
Command...
Process organic material.

525
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,179
Command...
Repurpose organic material.

526
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,031
Command...

527
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:44,067
for Darkseid.

528
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,249
Download complete.

529
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,890
Darkseid.

530
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,141
Excuse me, but this is the hole

531
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:28,678
These wigglers
crawled out of, right?

532
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,814
Vic stone?

533
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:34,717
What the hell happened to you?

534
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,947
That wasn't so hard.

535
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,958
Looks like
you could use a hand.

536
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,259
Flash! My boy.

537
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,294
Great to see you.

538
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,967
Oh, yeah, and that's batman.

539
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,268
Batman's real?

540
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,003
Yeah. He's over there.

541
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:27,938
Wait. What?

542
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,908
It is a real honor to meet you,
sir, batman,

543
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,176
Sir ba... Batman, sir.

544
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,311
- Don't bother.
- The guy's a total tool.

545
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:38,748
I've followed your efforts
in central city, Flash.

546
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,751
You do tight, efficient work.

547
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:46,923
Hey, Barry, you, uh, got
a little something on your nose.

548
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:50,026
Get ready. Here they come.

549
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:52,996
For Darkseid!

550
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,367
Hah!

551
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,646
Holy...

552
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,797
Greetings, warriors.

553
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,967
Dibs.

554
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,102
Hi.

555
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,107
Ah, it's good to be back
in the heat of war.

556
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:41,344
Yeah, you better run.

557
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,745
No, they're assembling,

558
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:46,816
Waiting for whoever's behind
this to launch the attack.

559
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:48,151
All right. Now what?

560
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:50,420
I don't know.

561
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,825
Incoming!

562
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,831
Mine.

563
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,702
Defense mode activated.

564
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,138
Damn it.

565
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,272
You're done.

566
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:11,474
No! I'm not with them!

567
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:15,812
- Hold on. I can vouch for that.
- He was at S.T.A.R. Labs.

568
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:19,082
Huh?

569
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,890
Hey there. What's up?

570
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,026
Shazam.

571
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:31,728
I'm with him.

572
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,963
He's not with me.

573
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:37,133
And who the hell
are you supposed to be,

574
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,035
Mr. Roboto?

575
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:42,405
- Who I am doesn't matter.
- What I know does.

576
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,373
Which is?

577
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,374
I've...

578
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,477
talked to their technology.

579
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:48,511
I know their plan.

580
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:51,247
They're terraforming the earth.

581
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:54,050
It's about to get ugly.

582
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:56,452
- That fits.
- How do you figure?

583
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,254
Well, for one thing,

584
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,857
The water's on fire.

585
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,286
What are they doing with them?

586
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,121
Can't be sure, but I know this.

587
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:35,424
They're not killing anyone.
They're harvesting them.

588
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:37,293
This isn't
an isolated incident either.

589
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,929
It's happening
across the world.

590
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,306
We're too late. He's here.

591
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,487
I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.

592
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,255
Lucky guess.

593
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:08,324
Hmm. He doesn't look
that tough.

594
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,275
No.

595
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,477
I am entropy.

596
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:31,380
I am death.

597
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,856
I am Darkseid.

598
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,525
Stand back
and peep the light show.

599
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,862
Green Lantern's got this.

600
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,217
That all you got?

601
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,385
Not all I got.

602
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:23,966
Uhh. I'm not through with you.

603
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,272
Aah!

604
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,522
Is that your boyfriend?

605
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:48,357
No.

606
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,192
Cool. Watch this.

607
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:51,227
Hey, blackheart the deatheater

608
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:54,363
Or whatever your
"World of Warcraft" name is,

609
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:55,998
Suck on this!

610
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,172
Aah!

611
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,075
Now what?

612
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:09,045
Now you die.

613
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,083
Wait! No!

614
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,598
We're gonna have to move fast.

615
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,667
Not a problem for me.

616
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,539
- They're splitting up.
- They can do that?

617
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,507
- They're locked on us.
- Come on, Barry.

618
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:41,243
You're moving fast,
so think fast.

619
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:01,097
Whew. Never had to catch
my breath before.

620
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,699
Oh, no. Superman.

621
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,573
Aah!

622
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:20,016
Finally,
the kryptonian is ours.

623
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:23,119
Master will be pleased.

624
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:37,033
- They flew off with him.
- I saw it. They took Superman.

625
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,701
I'll get him.

626
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,669
Lantern!

627
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,507
Ahh.

628
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:47,109
Out of my way, batman.

629
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:49,712
Your arm is broken, you idiot.

630
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,583
- I can handle this.
- Get out of my way.

631
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,786
- You're gonna die.
- Then I die.

632
00:50:56,788 --> 00:50:58,320
What are you trying to prove?

633
00:50:58,322 --> 00:51:00,723
I'm not trying
to prove anything,

634
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,691
You phenomenal douche bag.

635
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:06,662
Don't act like you know me.
You don't.

636
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,132
We're just somewhat alike.

637
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:11,534
We are nothing alike.

638
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,602
We're fighting alongside
an alien, an Amazon,

639
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:16,605
A human lightning bolt,
a cyborg, and a speedster.

640
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,141
Far as I can tell, Hal,
you and I

641
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:20,643
Are the only normal people here.

642
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:23,612
I never told you my name.

643
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:25,347
Saw it on your flight suit.

644
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:29,085
You're pretty
south of normal, spooky.

645
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:31,320
You know that, right?

646
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,422
My name is Bruce Wayne.

647
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:36,459
When I was 10, my parents were
murdered in front of my eyes.

648
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:38,227
I've spent my life
training to fight

649
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:41,430
The same sort of criminals
that took them from me,

650
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,766
But this, this is different.

651
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,101
This isn't about me.

652
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:47,870
Uh, you're telling me this why?

653
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:52,141
This is bigger than I am,
and it's bigger than you are.

654
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:53,375
Get out of your own way.

655
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:57,546
Focus on what's important here,
everyone else.

656
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:58,448
Regroup with the others.

657
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,483
- And do what, exactly?
- You're loud.

658
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:04,186
They'll listen to you
if you got something to say.

659
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:06,722
Try to at least sound smart.

660
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:08,258
Keep them alive.

661
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:10,526
Keep Darkseid busy
till I get back.

662
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:12,194
Get back? From where?

663
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:15,698
We won't win
without our big gun.

664
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,403
Where the hell are you going?

665
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,540
Hey!

666
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:28,511
I'm going to get Superman.

667
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,181
Bruce Wayne, huh?

668
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,285
Moron's crazier than I am.

669
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,933
You guys ok? Good.

670
00:53:23,935 --> 00:53:26,202
Listen up

671
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,970
Uh...

672
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,573
ahem!

673
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:32,541
We need to, uh...

674
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,376
We need to play offense

675
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,746
Instead of all
coming up to bat.

676
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,682
Um, what?

677
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:43,252
I apologize,
but I don't know your games.

678
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:44,720
I think what lantern is saying

679
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,922
Is that it's time
for some teamwork,

680
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,325
So let's pull it together.

681
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:52,595
Yeah, baby! Clap it up!

682
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,233
What's the plan, then?

683
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:57,667
Well...

684
00:53:57,668 --> 00:54:00,502
he blasts those beams
out of his eyes, right?

685
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:02,771
- It's settled, then.
- We blind him.

686
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:05,874
That's as good a plan
as any, yeah.

687
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:07,977
We follow,
and we stay out of sight.

688
00:54:07,979 --> 00:54:11,013
I'll turn on the fireworks
to get his attention.

689
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:12,982
Princess, you get
in striking distance

690
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:15,784
And stab that son of a bitch
in the eyes.

691
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:17,653
Like poor damned Oedipus.

692
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:19,688
Yeah, what
the hot Greek chick said.

693
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,559
And the invasion of monsters
raining from the sky?

694
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,027
What about them?

695
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,895
I might be able to send them

696
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:28,564
Back where they came from.

697
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:30,299
Good enough for me.

698
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:31,834
Here we go, team.

699
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:34,270
We got this!

700
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,742
"We got this"?

701
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:40,876
That's your big battle cry?

702
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:44,513
Don't worry about it,
smartass. Stick to the plan.

703
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:47,384
This is awesome.

704
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:48,784
Like that parker game
in overtime,

705
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,052
Where you ran the ball
the last...

706
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:52,655
All right, who are you,
and how do you know me?

707
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:53,623
What? I'm a fan.

708
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,992
Everyone around here
knows victory stone.

709
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:58,661
I'm not that guy anymore.

710
00:54:58,663 --> 00:55:00,963
- Sure you are.
- I'm not.

711
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,765
I'm a terminator, an android,

712
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:06,335
Some kind of cyborg.
Now I'm gonna have to worry

713
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:08,037
About operating systems
and computer viruses.

714
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:11,340
Spoiler... You won't get
to do any of that stuff

715
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:12,941
If this guy eats the world.

716
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:13,810
Don't you get it?

717
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,545
I don't have a place
anywhere anymore.

718
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:33,829
Looks to me like
your place is with us.

719
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,401
The parademon hives on earth

720
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:16,805
Were ill-Equipped to process
your flesh, my prize.

721
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,378
But here
in my personal laboratory,

722
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,748
I can splice
your kryptonian genetic code

723
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,116
To create a new form,

724
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:33,822
A super parademon
in the service of Darkseid.

725
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:42,431
And once we have our champion,

726
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:48,637
We will seize the other supers
and break them as well.

727
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,674
All hail Darkseid.

728
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,823
Ok, remember,
I'll distract him...

729
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:09,958
- Darkseid!
- What the...

730
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,211
Get him out of there.

731
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:32,848
His showboating is
gonna ruin the entire plan.

732
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,517
Oh, great. Now I'm batman.

733
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,993
- What's the big deal?
- I had him.

734
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:47,830
- Dude, you had squat.
- We had a plan.

735
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:50,966
Heads up, guys!

736
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,510
You are a warrior, not a child.

737
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:02,245
Act like it.

738
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:03,912
Yes, ma'am.

739
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:08,016
Now follow me to victory!

740
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,819
She digs me.

741
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:13,188
Attack!

742
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,565
True, the metamorphosis
is painful,

743
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:29,571
But soon you will never
feel anything ever again.

744
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,842
What? I didn't send for you.

745
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:39,748
Let him go.

746
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,951
I am impressed by your
resourcefulness, earthling,

747
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:46,788
But once the transformative
process is set in motion,

748
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,257
Nothing can stop it.

749
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:50,592
Your friend is gone.

750
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:52,628
With the help
of the kryptonian,

751
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,596
I'll see to it that your world

752
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:58,901
Will be just another
that has fallen to Darkseid.

753
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:02,838
And what if you never see it?

754
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,273
You wouldn't.

755
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:07,543
Wouldn't you?

756
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,249
Welcome, my children.

757
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:17,085
Protect your... Hunh! Unh!

758
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,734
Uhh!

759
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:14,209
Hey, Darkseid, eat this!

760
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,134
Come on, giant.

761
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,269
I'm getting bored.

762
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:44,873
This world is mine.

763
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:13,268
One down. One to go.

764
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,274
His knife was on the left side,

765
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:20,143
Making him right-Handed,

766
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:23,879
Which means
the power must be here.

767
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:27,435
Aah!

768
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,167
Yah!

769
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:45,513
Now, Flash,
take out the other eye!

770
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:51,353
Sorry. I need this to save the world.
Thanks for your help.

771
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,911
Did that work?

772
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:27,455
Yeah, I think that worked.

773
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,566
Superman!

774
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:42,604
You need to fight
whatever they're doing to you.

775
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:43,606
We need you, Clark.

776
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:46,041
The world needs Clark Kent.

777
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:49,945
Yaah!

778
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:08,363
Both eyeballs blown out,
and he's still standing.

779
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,001
What else can we do?

780
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:15,203
Try and send him home.

781
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:18,707
How?

782
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:22,644
Darkseid is transferring data
to those metal cubes.

783
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:24,045
They call them mother boxes.

784
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:26,381
They're creating portals,
boom tubes.

785
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:29,017
I just have to speak
their language.

786
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:34,089
I didn't understand
a single word you just said.

787
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,995
Connecting to network.

788
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:46,368
Unable to connect.

789
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,137
Got to get some altitude.

790
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:01,549
Connection established.

791
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:06,448
Get him in there.

792
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:21,729
I'll crush you like a nut.

793
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:23,598
Yaah!

794
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,170
How dare you?

795
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:31,372
I am Darkseid!

796
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:38,146
I don't care.

797
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:41,816
Kick his ass!

798
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:18,820
- Now, kid.
- Slam the door in his face.

799
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,856
Unable to connect.

800
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:23,424
Damn it.

801
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:39,407
Yaah!

802
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:43,178
Error. Error.

803
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:46,814
The computer is not responding.

804
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:55,456
Come on, you stupid machine.

805
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:56,591
Work!

806
01:09:56,593 --> 01:09:58,960
Network connected.

807
01:09:58,961 --> 01:09:59,762
Yes.

808
01:09:59,763 --> 01:10:02,664
Insufficient energy.

809
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:04,232
Shit.

810
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:05,334
It's programmed,

811
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:07,268
But I don't have
the juice to push it.

812
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,603
I need a huge blast of power.

813
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:10,738
Shouldn't be a problem.

814
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:20,448
Shazam!

815
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:38,700
Kryptonian,
you are coming with me.

816
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:41,903
Ohh. Like hell, I am.

817
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:02,523
Initiating boom tube closure.

818
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:24,479
Got you!

819
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:32,654
Hey, you're that kid.

820
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:36,024
Hell of a catch, man.

821
01:11:36,026 --> 01:11:37,492
Thanks.

822
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:38,460
Don't tell them, ok?

823
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:41,329
It's none of their
freaking business.

824
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:43,698
It'll be our secret.

825
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:47,468
I always said you had
an arm like a cannon.

826
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:50,772
Now you totally do.

827
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,554
Nice job, kid.

828
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:08,623
Where'd Shazam go?

829
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:09,591
He took off,

830
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:10,858
Said he had a hot date.

831
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:14,629
Right. Who'd go out
with that immature hothead?

832
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:16,664
What about the human victims?

833
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:17,433
I can see them.

834
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:22,036
Let me just get this baby
to boom for me one more time.

835
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,710
I got this.

836
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,919
He's good for cleanup,
at least.

837
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:40,988
How do we keep
Darkseid from returning?

838
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,690
All those mother boxes
are fried.

839
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:45,593
Then they won't be able
to get back anytime soon.

840
01:12:45,595 --> 01:12:47,528
It's a start.

841
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,930
Heads up.

842
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:51,566
There they are.

843
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:56,504
We should leave before
they blame us again. Ugh.

844
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,441
You guys are amazing.

845
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:02,877
What's your hurry, Flash?

846
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,149
Today marks a momentous day
in human history.

847
01:13:08,151 --> 01:13:11,919
In our darkest hour,
these superheroes

848
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,921
Donned their
colorful costumes...

849
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:15,723
- costume?
- Took to the streets...

850
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,492
- this is my uniform.
- Quiet.

851
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:18,893
Oh, now you wanna bark orders?

852
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,896
After I did the heavy lifting
and pulled everyone together.

853
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:25,433
You're referring to when you
botched my very simple directives

854
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:27,402
And Wonder Woman led the charge?

855
01:13:27,404 --> 01:13:29,003
Cyborg showed you a video?

856
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:30,705
He e-Mailed it to me.

857
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:31,873
I really hate you, bats.

858
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:34,909
I can't believe people
are no longer afraid of us.

859
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,145
Or that they think
we're a team.

860
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:37,980
We're not a team.

861
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:40,882
But I am pleased to meet
some folks who get me.

862
01:13:40,884 --> 01:13:44,986
Yes, it was good to walk
among a pantheon again.

863
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:46,487
How do you mean?

864
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:48,055
Hades, Apollo,

865
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:50,925
Hermes, Hephaestus, Zeus,

866
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,928
Each a god in their own right.

867
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,096
And me?

868
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:59,467
I have never met
anyone like you, Superman,

869
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:00,868
God or mortal.

870
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:01,737
...At this time.

871
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:04,138
Is it by chance, by fate,

872
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,874
Or are there
bigger forces at work?

873
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:09,877
Is our modern
technological age...

874
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:10,912
I shouldn't be up here.

875
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:14,482
- Are you kidding me?
- Of course you should. We won.

876
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:17,084
Be proud.
Your dad looks like he is.

877
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:19,620
...In fact,
the way of all people,

878
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,623
Working for
a free and peaceful planet.

879
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,225
As we have seen...

880
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:25,027
by the way, man,

881
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:28,663
Thanks for not talking
about the other thing.

882
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:29,897
Don't sweat it,

883
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:32,467
And thanks
for seeing me in here.

884
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:34,902
- What?
- You're the bomb, victory.

885
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:38,039
- I know. I know.
- You keep reminding me.

886
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:41,008
Victory. Victory.

887
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,044
Victory.

888
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:44,645
These super friends

889
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:47,715
Used their superpowers
to protect us...

890
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,517
and we're not friends either.

891
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:51,786
- We let them think we're both.
- Why?

892
01:14:51,788 --> 01:14:54,622
- It'll keep Gotham P.D.
- Off my back,

893
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:56,090
The air force off yours.

894
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:57,725
I don't know. A team?

895
01:14:57,727 --> 01:15:00,995
I've got a lot
of responsibilities.

896
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:01,630
As do I.

897
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:02,997
Well, I have a whole universe

898
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:05,032
To protect, people,
so there you go.

899
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:07,201
- Come on.
- We can do it together.

900
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:09,837
Yeah? Can you fly into space?

901
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:10,872
I can.

902
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:11,707
Not my point. Look,

903
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:14,509
We are not friends.
We're not a team.

904
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,210
I don't agree, Hal.

905
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:18,246
I kind of liked
being a part of something.

906
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,014
Yeah, you would.

907
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,549
Listen, this was just
a one-Time deal, ok?

908
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:24,118
And what if something
like this should happen again?

909
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,121
- Please.
- What could possibly happen?

910
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:29,891
That said, I am very pleased

911
01:15:29,893 --> 01:15:31,058
To introduce to you...

912
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,927
Gee, I didn't even ask.

913
01:15:32,929 --> 01:15:34,896
Do you guys have a name?

914
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:36,264
- Yes, we do.
- We do?

915
01:15:36,266 --> 01:15:39,033
- That's right.
- You can call us...

916
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:39,935
the super seven.

917
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:42,136
Please don't call us that.

918
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:44,639
- Hera help us.
- The super seven?

919
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:47,074
What? You don't like it?

920
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:42,690
The surface dwellers
have killed our king.

921
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:47,395
This is an act of war,
and they will pay.
