For a moment I thought
you were abandoning me.

Fernand Mondego does not
abandon his friends in the face
ofstupid, suicidal danger.

However, as Monsieur Morell's

As long as you're still awake,
Monsieur Dantes, I wonder...

ifI might have
a word with you.

60
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:19,889
I'm curious. What's thesignificance
ofthe chesspiece?

61
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:24,029
It'sjust something
we've done since childhood.

I'm moved byyour effort to save
your captain's life, Dantes.

66

He is my captain...
and my friend, Your Majesty.

67
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:46,049
Loyal friends
are rare indeed.

68
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,714
In fact, it is upon such
a matter I wish to speak.

69
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:53,953
I have written a rather
sentimental letter to an
old comrade in Marseilles.

00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:56,621
It's a side ofme I prefer
the British not see.

71

ofopening my mail,

Oh, I-I don't--

74
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:08,840
It'sjust a letter
from one old soldier to another.

75
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,775
It's totally innocent,
I assureyou.

76
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:15,303
But more important,
it is the price I demand
for the use ofmy physician.

00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,243
Then I agree.

this letter's existence
to be known to anyone else.

You let me fight him?
