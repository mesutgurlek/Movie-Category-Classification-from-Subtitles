<i>never leaving behind a fallen comrade,

<i>I thank you.</i>

9
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:57,273
America thanks you,

10
00:00:57,343 --> 00:01:00,176

Cameron Poe, you have pleaded guilty
to manslaughter in the first degree.

69

With your military skills,
you are a deadly weapon

and are not subject to the same laws
as other people that are provoked,

71

because you can respond
with deadly force.

72
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:50,763
It is the order of this court that you be
remanded to a federal penitentiary

00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:41,385
Now, most of these guys are lifers,
some on death row.

150
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:45,446
Pure predators,
each and every one of them.

151
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,361
- Hey, lady!
- Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie.

152
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,557
My name is Bishop.
Guard Bishop to you.

153
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:57,295
I gotta be gettin' my shot before we
go gettin' on some airplane, Guard Bishop.

154
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:58,893
What's your name?

155
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:01,599
Odell. They didn't give me
my shot last night.

156
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:06,576
OK, you're diabetic? All right, your insulin's
on board. We'll give it to you in flight.

157
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:09,572
- Cameron Poe.
- Yes, ma'am.

158
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:13,641
You're under full restraints till you're
released from your prison, understand?

159
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:17,177
Yes, ma'am. As long as I make it home
on time, it makes no never mind.

160
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:20,020
- It's my daughter's birthday.
- Well, congratulations.

161
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:24,085
I got locked down three months before
she was born. She ain't never seen me.

162
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:26,563
- And why not?
- No way was she gonna meet her daddy

163
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:30,500
in a prison visitor room
surrounded by homemade cookies and...

164
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:32,730
and love-starved murderers.

165
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:34,067
No way.

166
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:37,438
What you got here is a walking,
talking reason to rehabilitate.

167
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:45,049
So today let's exemplify
our three operative words -

168
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:49,282
firm, fair and vigilant.

169
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,220
Now, let's go to work.

170
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,885
We off-load six in Carson City,
the rest to Feltham.

171
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,053
Good. Let's go deal with the DEA boys.

172
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,893
- Know this guy?
- Haven't had the pleasure.

173
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:06,233
He's a piece of work,
a real piece of work.

174
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:09,866
Duncan, good to see you.
She sure is beautiful.

175
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:13,400
Hey, beautiful? Sunsets are beautiful.
Newborn babies are beautiful.

176
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,470
This, this is fucking spectacular!

177
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:18,914
Duncan, this is Vince Larkin.
He's overseeing the transpo.

178
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:21,885
Vince, Duncan Malloy - DEA.

179
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:25,685
Nice to meet ya. I'm sure we're gonna have
a good time working on this together.

180
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:45,001
Hey, Willie. How ya doin'?
You know each other?

181
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:46,544
- Vince Larkin.
- Sims, DEA.

182
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:49,012
The file on Francisco Cindino,
son of Eduardo,

183
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:53,950
prime mover of narcotics from Colombia.
It's gonna be an all-star flight.

184
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:56,487
This kid's a font of information
about the family business.

185
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:58,682
- 11 ½ OK?
- Yeah.

186
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:03,023
Look at him. Nice college boy, right?
We interrogated him, he gave up nothing.

187
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:05,188
This is our last chance
before the FBI gets him.

188
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:07,755
Over my dead body
those assholes get the glory.

189
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,960
We pick up Mr. Cindino in Carson City.

190
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:13,300
Till the plane hits Alabama,
we've got two hours to get him to talk.

191
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:17,172
You'll sit next to him. He's known to be
garrulous in the company of thieves.

192
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:19,107
Garrulous?
What the fuck is garrulous?

193
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:22,614
That would be loquacious, verbose,
effusive. How about "chatty"?

194
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:27,209
- What's with dictionary boy here?
- Thesaurus boy is more appropriate.

195
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,449
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.

196
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:33,320
- Whoa, whoa. Gun?
- We got rules, gentlemen.

197
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:36,725
- Yeah, so do we. Our agents go armed.
- No one carries on this flight.

198
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:41,129
I've got a small arsenal in the belly of
the plane, a pistol in the cockpit lock box.

199
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,067
That's it. Other than that,
we keep the plane like a prison.

200
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:46,161
No weapons on the aircraft, period.

201
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:48,832
My man does not get on
that plane without his gun.

202
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:51,501
Then your man doesn't get on the plane.

203
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:56,940
OK, Willie, give it to him.

204
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,251
Give him the gun.

205
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:08,756
- Avoid eye contact.
- I got it.

206
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:12,923
- In the pen it's a sign of aggression.
- Larkin, I got it.

207
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:15,091
OK.

208
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,703
<i>(man over PA) Foxtrot Charlie.
We are ready to disembark.</i>

209
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:21,932
<i>Awaiting your go on separatee transfer.</i>

210
00:15:23,342 --> 00:15:26,072
Well, we told you today's flight
would be special.

211
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:28,669
That's William Bedford,
aka "Billy Bedlam."

212
00:15:28,747 --> 00:15:30,271
- The mass murderer?
- The same.

213
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:32,909
He caught his wife in bed
with another man. Left her alone.

214
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:36,011
Drove four towns over
to his wife's family's house.

215
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:38,386
Killed her parents,
brothers, sisters and dog.

216
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,049
Scan him.

217
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,753
And who is that
good-looking brother on screen?

218
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:45,695
Nathan Jones, aka "Diamond Dog."

219
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:48,062
Former general of the Black Guerrillas.

220
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:51,227
He blew up a meeting of
the National Rifle Association, saying:

221
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:54,295
"They represented the basest negativity
of the white race."

222
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:58,434
<i>He wrote a book in prison called
Reflections in a Diamond Eye.</i>

223
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,843
<i>New York Times called it "A wake-up
call for the black community."</i>

224
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:05,644
They're talking to Denzel for the movie.

225
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:20,528
Close door number one.

226
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:27,402
This one's done it all -
kidnapping, robbery, murder, extortion.

227
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:30,908
<i>Foxtrot Charlie. Perimeter is secure.
You are clear to release.</i>

228
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:37,415
His name is Cyrus Grissom,
aka "Cyrus the Virus."

229
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:40,918
39 years old, 25 of them
spent in our institutions.

230
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:44,854
But he's bettered himself inside. Earned
two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.

231
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:49,656
He also killed 11 fellow inmates,
incited three riots and escaped twice.

232
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:52,219
Likes to brag that
he killed more men than cancer.

233
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:55,994
OK, open wide.
Lift your tongue.

234
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,998
Cyrus is a poster child for the criminally
insane. He's a true product of the system.

235
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:07,102
What's that supposed to mean?
What is he, one of these sociology majors

236
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:09,613
who thinks we're responsible
for breeding these animals?

237
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:12,775
No, but I could point a few fingers
if you'd feel comfortable.

238
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:26,397
Ah, look at this walking penis.
Boy, you are one skinny Negro.

239
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:28,456
- Easy man. Shit.
- Open up.

240
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,899
Man, it smells like
somebody shit in your mouth.

241
00:17:30,969 --> 00:17:33,233
He told me he loved me.

242
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:36,240
- Get out of my face.
- All right, all right. Shit.

243
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:43,814
- Hey, Larkin, who's that guy?
- That is Cameron Poe.

244
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:47,181
A parolee hitchin' a ride home.
He's a nobody.

245
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:49,083
OK, let's do it.

246
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:54,524
Willie, nobody on the plane knows
your classification, not even my guards.

247
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:58,356
- Guard Bishop.
- Hey, Larkin.

248
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,455
Tell me, Skip,
is the U.S. Marshal Service

249
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:03,592
in the habit of employing annoying,
wise-ass bookworm creeps?

250
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,329
Larkin's one of the best we got.

251
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:09,898
Yeah, well, I'd still like to
crush his larynx with my boot.

252
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:14,639
Scan him. Face me.

253
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:22,878
- What's this shit?
- It's my daughter.

254
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:26,219
I don't care if it's the weepin' mama
of Christ. No personal possessions.

255
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,124
Just as long as you know
I'll get that back at some point.

256
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:32,220
Are you tellin' me what
I'm gonna be doin' here, numb-nuts?

257
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:34,060
- You heard me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

258
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:37,101
Come on, break it up.

259
00:18:39,237 --> 00:18:44,004
Oh, now, look at this fashion statement.
The do-rag gotta go, homeboy.

260
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:46,543
What you got in your pocket?

261
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:50,775
- Just my dick, Officer.
- Get on the plane.

262
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:56,052
<i>- Right here.
- (man over PA) Attention. Officers.</i>

263
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:58,248
<i>Final check. All restraints.</i>

264
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,051
Sweet bird of freedom.

265
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:07,098
What's up, man? Pinball Parker.

266
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:12,398
Armed robber, arsonist, dope fiend.
Angry, angry nigga, man.

267
00:19:12,471 --> 00:19:14,632
Aw, shucks.

268
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:22,837
- All right, face me.
- I got him.

269
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:25,382
Come on.

270
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:28,614
Open.

271
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:38,822
You guys are late for the party.

272
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:41,491
- OK.
- Let's go, sweetheart.

273
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,470
What's up, Cochise?

274
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,338
How.

275
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:56,870
I'm just fuckin' with you. Don't get all
Wounded Knee on me and shit.

276
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:00,917
You look like you wanna scalp a nigga.

277
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:06,080
What you lookin' at, punk?

278
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:09,649
Nothin'. I was just admirin' your cage.

279
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:12,196
Fits you pretty good.

280
00:20:13,598 --> 00:20:16,260
Well, welcome aboard.

281
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:19,098
My, my. As I look around,
I see a lot of celebrities among us.

282
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,335
<i>I see 11 Current Affairs, two Hard Copys,
and a genuine Geraldo interviewee.</i>

283
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:26,741
But I gotta tell you,
none of this impresses me.

284
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:30,042
We have rules on this aircraft,
and they're gonna be enforced.

285
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:34,051
It's like kindergarten. Keep your hands
to yourself, keep the decibel level down.

286
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,519
And if any of you
should feel the need to scream,

287
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:38,681
spit or bite, you get the treatment.

288
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:42,891
- Fuck you, pig.
- Gag and bag this Nazi muffin.

289
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:47,532
See, this kind of thing
puts me in a foul mood.

290
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,898
These rules will be enforced.
If there's a hint of trouble,

291
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:53,267
if any of you so much as
passes gas in my direction,

292
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:55,169
it offends my delicate nasal passages,

293
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,768
your testicles will become
my personal property.

294
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:03,541
That's pretty clear. Good.

295
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:25,594
Call me Johnny 600
if they knew the truth.

296
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,367
Nah, doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.

297
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:32,171
Anyway, I despise rapists.

298
00:21:32,243 --> 00:21:35,041
You're somewhere between
a cockroach and that white stuff

299
00:21:35,113 --> 00:21:38,549
that accumulates at the corner in
your mouth when you're really thirsty.

300
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:42,144
But in your case, I'll make an exception.

301
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:45,789
- Guard Falzon.
- What?

302
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:49,725
Oh, stewardess, stewardess?
What's the in-flight movie today?

303
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:51,762
Well, I think you'll like it, Cyrus.

304

<i>It's I'll Never Make Love
to a Woman on the Beach Again.</i>

305
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:59,099
<i>And it's preceded by the award-winning
short, No More Steak For Me Ever.</i>

306

Funny fucker, aren't ya?

307
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:10,841
Hope this goes smoothly.
All those monsters on one plane.

308
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:12,974
Please, Ginny,
this is a well-oiled machine.

309
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:16,646
The only thing we gotta worry about
is stale peanuts and a little turbulence.

310
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:21,859
Close forward gate.

311
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:36,039
Close middle gate.

312
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,614
- Come on, I need my shot!
- Coming. I'm coming. Left arm.

313
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,031
Hey, Chief, if you come
through this all right,

314
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:46,475
hope you don't hold a grudge.

315
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:49,310
What the fuck are you doin'?

316
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:54,548
<i>(screams)</i>

317
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:57,611
Get the extinguisher.
Open the middle gate.

Shit. Did you see that motherfucker, man?
He spontaneously combusted.

320
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:10,691
He's a fuckin' witch doctor.
I seen that shit on Discovery Channel.

321
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:12,862
- Code red! Code red!
- Chantin' and shit.

322
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:15,098
- Fire in the rear cabin.
- I've got a fire.

323
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:17,607
- Where is it?
- She's reporting it in the rear cabin.

324
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:18,733
<i>(alarm blaring)</i>

325
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,371
At first I thought he was singin' "YMCA."
Then the flames.

326
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:23,914
Shit!

327
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:35,954
Yeah!

Hey, man, get off my insulin!

Bobby, open the door!
Open the goddam door!

332
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:07,587
Pinball, go!
Pull the lever. Go! Go!

333
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:12,992
Pinball, behind you!

334
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:19,230
Get the gun out of the lock box, Mack.
Go on back there, check it out.

335
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:33,579
Go! Go!

336
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:47,654

Oh, my God.

338

Say there was a disturbance
but it's under control.

339
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:55,299
Say it, or I will kill you.

340
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:57,534
Without me,
you got nobody to fly the plane.

341
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:00,476
I never think that far ahead.

342
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:04,373
All right, I'm doin' it.
Just take it easy.

343
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:06,781
And if you say a word about this
over the radio,

344
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:12,221
the next wings you see will belong to
the flies buzzing over your rotting corpse.

345
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:15,551
Uh, Carson City.

346
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:18,988
Hey! Hey!

347
00:26:24,235 --> 00:26:28,604
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

348

- Roger that, Carson City.

352
00:26:45,156 --> 00:26:47,886
Calm down. A little ruckus,
and the pilot hit the alarm.

353
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:51,520
- Just a little ruckus?
- Pilot just checked in. Everything's fine.

354
00:26:51,596 --> 00:26:56,056
Transponder's confirmed,
and there's your baby.

<i>Damn, this pig is heavy!
Oops. (laughs)</i>

00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:05,965
Shit.

357
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:09,078
If we let you out,
you gonna play nice?

358
00:27:09,147 --> 00:27:11,615
Probably not.

359
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:20,923
I got a spot on my arm just for you.

360
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:24,985
- Hey, man. Get off my medication.
- I'm sorry, man. The shit's in my way.

361

I'm gonna use your whole body

All right, man. Stop rushin'.

Ah, yeah.

364
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:46,215
No, no. Oh, no!
Make me hurt you.

365
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:53,352
- What you doin'?
- I can't allow that.

366
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:55,824
- You know what I am?
- Ugly all day.

367
00:27:58,363 --> 00:28:01,332
This ain't happenin',
not here, not now.

368
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:03,196
- Oh, it's happenin'.
- Hey!

369
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,735
Relax. He's right.
Not here and not now.

370
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:08,294
- Do you fly, Johnny?
- No.

371
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:12,503
Keep that in mind when you look at her.
If your dick jumps out of your pants,

372
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:14,738
you jump out of this plane.

What are the numbers in Carson City?
How many on, how many off?

374

- Six off and ten on.
- Find the six.

375
00:28:30,228 --> 00:28:33,925
Well, I know three of these brothers.
They right back there.

376
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:36,967
Uh, the other three
are Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

377
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:38,127
Where are they?

378
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:40,363
That's a damn good question,
and I'll find out.

379
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:43,701
The pilot wants to know what's next.

380
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:46,505
He's to land at Carson City Airport
as scheduled.

381
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:50,172
Carson City? The law is down there.
You lost your mind?

382
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:53,706
According to
my last psych evaluation, yes.

383
00:28:54,585 --> 00:28:58,817
Diamond Dog, if you would.

384

You think you're free?
You're not. Now, listen up.

385

40 to 50 US prison guards armed with
shotguns are waitin' for us at the next stop.

Now, if you do exactly what we tell ya,

387
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:16,169
the rest of our lives will be
a vacation in a non-extradition country.

<i>- and dirty, naked freaks.

- Keep cool, boss.
- Shut up.

397
00:29:50,675 --> 00:29:55,237
- Now you were saying?
- Oh, that's very clever, Cyrus.

398
00:29:55,313 --> 00:29:57,747
You think I give a shit
about that little bitch guard?

399
00:29:57,815 --> 00:30:01,148
Maybe you didn't hear me. I'm DEA.
You know what the fuck that means?

400
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:03,483
- You the most crooked nigga here.
- Shut up.

401
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:07,422
DEA? What are you doin' on this flight?
Won't they fly you boys commercially?

402
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:10,950
Don't push me, Cyrus, man.
I swear I'll blow him away right now.

403
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:14,088
You know, the next time
you choose a human shield,

404
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:16,929
you're better off not pickin'
a two-bit Negro crackhead.

405
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:19,333
Suck my dick, Cyrus.

406
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:22,804
- Shoot him.
- Quiet, sweetheart.

407
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:26,941
- I think you should just stop.
- Stay back, man.

408
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:29,571
- Stay back!
- Just stop before somebody gets killed.

409
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:31,342
Back!

410
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,508
- All right, cowboy, I'm back.
- Stay back!

411
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:36,519
You know you're in a situation
you can't control, right?

412
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:39,249
I can't control it?
I can't control it?

413
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:42,690
- You're a dead man.
- Shut the fuck up!

414
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:06,111
What's your name, convict?

415
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:08,982
- My name?
- Yeah.

00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:13,513
- Poe.
- Nice work, Poe. Truly nice work.

417
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:22,392
Nice goin', son.

418
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:25,196
Not only did you not save this dude's life,

419
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:29,000
you done made best friends
with Cyrus the damn Virus.

420
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:33,032
Hey, Cyrus, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

421
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,407
Yeah, what's the good news?

422
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:37,140
The goods news is I found
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

423
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:39,809
- What's the bad news?
- The bad news is,

424
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:42,978
this dead fellow right here
happens to be Benson.

425
00:31:43,054 --> 00:31:47,582
This Aryan fellow with the bullet hole
in his forehead is Carls,

426
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:50,525
and this honky he's draggin' in
is Popovitch.

427
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:54,998
I don't know how to tell you this, Cyrus,
but we are three white guys short,

428
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:58,092
or as they say in Ebonics,
"We be fucked."

429
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,738
Look, man, I just wanna know.

430
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:06,368
All right, you didn't... You didn't mean
that dirty-nigger crackhead shit, did you?

431
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:08,207
Gimme that gun.

432
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,372
Hell, yes, I meant it.

433
00:32:10,448 --> 00:32:14,350
Listen, Carson City is expecting
six men to get off this plane

434
00:32:14,418 --> 00:32:17,683
and we'll give 'em exactly what they expect.
So I need three volunteers.

435
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:21,088
Come on. Let's go, son.

436
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:24,558
- Don't look at me, pal.
- What about her?

437
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:28,121
I'm servin' eight consecutive life sentences.
I won't get off this plane.

438
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,861
I got my insulin,
but they broke all the damn needles.

439
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:35,269
If I don't get my shot soon,
they'll be sending flowers to my mother.

440
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:37,204
- I'm too old for this shit.
- No offense.

441
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:40,904
- I can take care of myself.
- I can see that.

442
00:32:40,978 --> 00:32:43,572
Go ahead, go to the back.
Anybody else?

443
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:47,584
- Hey, right here, man. Us two.
- Great, go ahead. Go to the back.

444
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:54,719
Hey, whoa, stop. The guys
they're expecting are white.

445
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,885
That puts you shit out of luck.

446
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:58,826
- Come on, man.
- Tell you what. Sit down.

447
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:01,057
One of my associates
will bring you a phone book,

448
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:03,225
and you call the Affirmative Action Office.

449
00:33:03,301 --> 00:33:06,793
- You, go ahead.
- Yeah, that's it.

450
00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:10,534
- I'm gone, man. I'm dead in two hours.
- No.

451
00:33:10,608 --> 00:33:16,547
I'll get off, scream to high heaven.
This plane won't leave Carson City.

452
00:33:19,317 --> 00:33:21,842
We need another white boy to volunteer.

453
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:27,148
- Pilot's white.
- Wait, wait, wait. The pilot?

454
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:32,252
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- Relax, Billy. Welcome to the machine.

455
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,321
You rang?

456
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:37,424
Carson City says we got
a hell of a sandstorm down there.

457

Last tenant, Cyrus Grissom.

461
00:33:57,755 --> 00:34:00,815
Got scratches on the wall.
Probably a weapon sharpening.

462
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:04,122
- What about the loose shelf screw?
- What the hell is this?

463
00:34:04,195 --> 00:34:06,129
Looks like cocaine.

464

- I don't know. It's all soft.

OK, old man.
Now you're Mr. Popovitch.

Gentlemen, you'll reach
the Nevada pen in about two hours.

469

the sudden impulse to squeal like a pig.

Not that we don't trust you.
But let's face it, you're criminals.

472

- I want to stay on.

473

What?

474
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:52,739
I changed my mind.

475
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:55,370
So, Cyrus, we got a little mind-changer.

476
00:34:55,446 --> 00:34:59,405
I got 15 years left,
and I know I'd just hate myself

477
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:02,418
if I thought I blew my one shot
at a naked party freak

478
00:35:02,486 --> 00:35:04,886
and an umbrella drink.

479
00:35:04,955 --> 00:35:08,391
You got 15 years? Boy, a second ago
you couldn't wait to get off this plane.

480
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:12,122
I know. Fear of freedom, I guess.

481
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:16,395
- What did you say your name was again?
- Cameron Poe.

482
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:18,867
Wait. I know that name.

483
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:23,436
- You're Cameron Poe?
- That's right.

484
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,443
You killed the giant.

485
00:35:29,113 --> 00:35:30,307
That's right.

486
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:35,179
- The who?
- The giant.

487
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,547
Wallace Wilson.

488
00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:40,283
Big bad brother.

489
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:44,623
You put him down on the tiles
bare-handed, so they say.

490
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:48,488
They say right.

491
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:52,730
Damn, I knew I knew that name, man.

492
00:35:52,803 --> 00:35:57,069
- And why'd you do that?
- He tired to take my black cherry Jello.

493
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:02,045
And I like black cherry Jello.

494
00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:05,382
You like black cherry Jello?

495
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:10,378
I like you.
Stand up. Get the cuffs off him.

496
00:36:12,022 --> 00:36:16,755
Pick out a guard, and then put
that dead cop's prison issues on him.

497
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:25,032
I'm still gonna fuck her.
Then I'm gonna fuck you.

498
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:27,502
Then I'm gonna fuck your whole family.

499
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:32,804
OK. For now, just fuck yourself.

- Right on time.

Nah, paperwork. Any weekend plans?

00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,191
Shine, sweet freedom, shine!

597
00:46:58,168 --> 00:47:00,602
<i>(cheering)</i>

598
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:08,177
Trust me, folks. This is gonna be
a day you will never forget.

599
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:12,011
Just step right on board
and find yourself a seat.

600
00:47:15,652 --> 00:47:17,745
Don't they have a way
of tracking these planes?

601
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:21,655
Oh, yeah. It's called a transponder.
Every plane's got one, Cindino.

602
00:47:21,725 --> 00:47:25,126
Swamp, where is the transponder?

603
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,991
<i>(gasps) Where indeed?</i>

604
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:36,938
Are you sure it's safe to fly in this?

605
00:47:37,007 --> 00:47:39,202
No problem.
I've done this a thousand times.

606
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:44,339
We'll be through this in a few minutes.
You all right back there, ladies?

607
00:47:45,582 --> 00:47:49,814
We're following the transponder.
We know exactly where they're heading.

608
00:47:49,886 --> 00:47:51,478
What the fuck happened?

609
00:47:51,555 --> 00:47:54,217
What about Sims?
What happened to Sims?

610
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,725
Duncan, they killed him.

611
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,886
They got the plane.

612
00:48:13,376 --> 00:48:17,244
I knew that guy for six years.

613
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:19,908
I trained him.

614
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,975
I put him on that plane.

615
00:48:23,053 --> 00:48:25,044
Now what?

616
00:48:32,362 --> 00:48:35,923
Tell me, Skip, what kind of a Keystone
Kops operation are you guys runnin' here?

617
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:38,832
And you, you little shit.
You got my agent killed!

618
00:48:38,902 --> 00:48:40,836
Hey, he brought a gun on the plane.

619
00:48:40,904 --> 00:48:43,839
If I knew how you run things,
I'd have told him bring a fuckin' Uzi!

620
00:48:43,907 --> 00:48:46,273
No one carries on these flights!

621
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:49,176
No one! He brought a gun
and he got himself killed.

622
00:48:49,246 --> 00:48:51,373
And he compromised
the safety of my men!

623
00:48:51,448 --> 00:48:53,609
Your men are incompetent!

624
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:57,016
They let themselves get taken over
by a bunch of thugs in chains and cages!

625
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:01,990
- I'm not gonna listen to this shit!
- Guys, guys. Let's work it out.

626
00:49:03,326 --> 00:49:05,794
OK. OK.

627
00:49:07,731 --> 00:49:11,098
So, what do we do now?

628
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,499
What's the plan?
You do have a plan, don't you?

629
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,401
We're workin' on it.

630
00:49:15,472 --> 00:49:18,305
Contingency plans
for something like this don't exist.

631
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:21,208
- It's never been contemplated.
- Start contemplating,

632
00:49:21,278 --> 00:49:25,078
'cause this is a situation
that needs to get unfucked right now!

633
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:30,283
I want a chopper. Make that a few of 'em.
They need to be armed.

634
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:33,652
I don't care if it's National Guard,
Air Force, whatever.

635
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:35,748
Just get 'em here,
and get 'em here now.

636
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:41,561
- What do you want to do with him?
- I don't know,

637
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:45,829
but this is no way to treat
a national treasure. Let him out.

638
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:50,467
- You sure?
- Love your work.

639
00:50:20,637 --> 00:50:24,129
They're headed southeast toward Arizona.

640
00:50:32,816 --> 00:50:35,979
- Pinball didn't make it.
- No?

641
00:50:36,052 --> 00:50:38,646
That's too bad. I liked Pinball.

642
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:43,321
- What do you want?
- I wanna know what the plan is.

643
00:50:43,393 --> 00:50:45,793
Why you care?

644
00:50:45,862 --> 00:50:49,798
I got just as much ridin' on this as you.
We're all convicts here.

645
00:50:49,866 --> 00:50:51,857
<i>(man over radio)
Cyrus Grissom. Do you copy?</i>

646
00:50:51,935 --> 00:50:53,994
Cyrus Grissom, do you copy?

647
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,402
Yes, I copy. Identify yourself.

648
00:50:57,474 --> 00:51:01,137
This is United States Marshal Vince
Larkin and Duncan Malloy of the DEA.

649
00:51:01,211 --> 00:51:04,738
Oh, Agent Malloy.
I'm so sorry about your associate.

650
00:51:04,814 --> 00:51:08,306
Nothing is quite as sad
as seeing a grown man pissing his pants.

651
00:51:08,385 --> 00:51:10,148
Grissom, you puny, fucking animal!

652
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,246
When I get through with you,
you'll beg for the electric chair.

653
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:15,291
Hey, I don't like him.

654
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,486
If he speaks again,
this conversation is terminated.

655
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:21,655
He doesn't want to talk again.
Really. He's done talking.

656
00:51:21,731 --> 00:51:24,825
- He's leaving the building, OK?
- Good, then I'll talk to you.

657
00:51:24,901 --> 00:51:28,564
Here are the rules. First I ask
a question, then you ask a question.

658
00:51:28,638 --> 00:51:30,333
OK. What's your question?

659
00:51:30,407 --> 00:51:33,899
In Carson City,
your bulls were onto us. How?

660
00:51:33,977 --> 00:51:35,774
- One of the guards...
- Shh.

661
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:38,040
- One of the guards...
- One of the guards

662
00:51:38,114 --> 00:51:40,947
faked a heart attack and we had to
remove his restraints.

663
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:42,507
All right?

664
00:51:42,585 --> 00:51:45,076
I see. And what's your question?

665
00:51:45,155 --> 00:51:47,419
Where you goin' with my plane, Cyrus?

666
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,516
- We're going to Disneyland.
- You're lying, Cyrus.

667
00:51:50,593 --> 00:51:52,788
So are you, Vince.

668
00:51:52,862 --> 00:51:56,525
# Oh, nothin' makes me sadder than

669
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:01,559
# The agent lost his bladder in the airplane

670
00:52:03,339 --> 00:52:07,799
Lerner Airfield, Poe. Middle of nowhere.
That's our rendezvous point.

671
00:52:07,877 --> 00:52:13,838
49 minutes from anything
resembling authority. So now you know.

672
00:52:14,284 --> 00:52:16,582
<i>(woman over PA) Your attention. Please.
Flight 475...</i>

673
00:52:16,653 --> 00:52:20,316
You excited? Yeah?
Sure look pretty.

674
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:28,957
- Mrs. Poe?
- That's right.

675
00:52:29,032 --> 00:52:31,660
My name's Grant,
US Marshal Service.

676
00:52:31,734 --> 00:52:34,259
There's been a slight problem
on your husband's flight.

677
00:52:34,337 --> 00:52:37,431
Your presence is requested.
I have a jet standing by.

678
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:48,483
Yee-ha!
What's on your mind, hillbilly?

679
00:52:48,551 --> 00:52:51,987
What was I thinking about?

680
00:52:52,055 --> 00:52:54,649
Oh, yeah. Yee-ha.
That's right.

681
00:52:54,724 --> 00:52:58,683
I was just wonderin' what a black militant -
that would be you -

682
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:02,219
was doin' takin' orders from
a white boy on a power trip.

683
00:53:02,298 --> 00:53:06,291
- Don't you think that's strange?
- It's a means to an end, my white friend.

684
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:08,701
A means to an end. See...

685
00:53:08,771 --> 00:53:12,172
I's can play house nigger
tills we get to where we're goin'.

686
00:53:12,976 --> 00:53:16,343
And then the day of the Dog begins.

687
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:28,049
So what was that all about?

688
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:31,093
Oh, nothin',
except they somehow managed

689
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,221
to get every creep and freak
in the universe onto this one plane,

690
00:53:35,298 --> 00:53:39,029
and then somehow managed
to let them take it over,

691
00:53:39,102 --> 00:53:43,698
and then somehow managed to
stick us right smack in the middle.

692
00:53:50,713 --> 00:53:53,273
Hi, Garland.

693
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:59,217
Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe.
His wife's on the way here now.

694
00:53:59,322 --> 00:54:03,053
US Ranger, highly decorated. A little
hell-raising, but nothing serious.

695
00:54:03,126 --> 00:54:04,889
Explain to me why any of this matters.

696
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:08,829
Fact one - we got a plane filled with killers,
rapists and thieves and Cameron Poe -

697
00:54:08,898 --> 00:54:12,390
in on an involuntary manslaughter beef,
non-gang affiliated.

698
00:54:12,468 --> 00:54:14,368
He's a parolee hitchin' a ride home.

699
00:54:14,437 --> 00:54:17,565
Fact two - Poe has a chance
to get off the plane.

700
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,234
Doesn't do it. Why?

701
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:23,802
Fact three - our guard, Falzon,
said a convict named Cameron Poe

702
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,577
planted Sims' tape recorder on him.
These are interesting facts.

703
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,381
You do the math on this,
and we got an ally on that plane.

704
00:54:31,454 --> 00:54:35,117
Ally? This guy is a criminal.
A murderer.

705
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:39,218
Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl
defending his wife and he killed a guy.

706
00:54:39,295 --> 00:54:42,958
- Could have happened to any one of us.
- I am not one of these animals.

707
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:45,694
That's original! When exactly
did they all become animals?

708
00:54:45,768 --> 00:54:48,931
When they stopped giving a damn
about the law, about civilization.

709
00:54:49,005 --> 00:54:52,964
"The degree of civilization in a society
can be judged by observing its prisoners."

710
00:54:53,042 --> 00:54:55,977
Dostoevsky said that
after doing a little time.

711
00:54:56,045 --> 00:55:00,778
"Fuck you!" Cyrus Grissom said that after
putting a bullet in my agent's head, OK?

712
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:03,318
The issue here is
how the plane is brought down.

713
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:05,445
Shoot it down.

714
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:09,514
Yeah. When exactly did this
become a DEA jurisdiction?

715
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:12,117
The second the DEA agent
was murdered.

716
00:55:12,195 --> 00:55:15,028
I am authorized to bring
Agent Sims' killers to justice using,

717
00:55:15,098 --> 00:55:19,762
- and I quote, "All necessary means."
- Not including shooting down my plane.

718
00:55:19,836 --> 00:55:22,168
- Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
- Is that right.

719
00:55:22,238 --> 00:55:26,675
- You're not seriously entertaining this.
- This is a drastic situation we got.

720
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:30,270
- Those are our men up there!
- All of whom signed a no-hostage clause.

721
00:55:30,346 --> 00:55:33,804
Who are you to decide the value of
a man's life? They're innocent people!

722
00:55:33,883 --> 00:55:35,817
<i>- (helicopters whirring)
- About time.</i>

723
00:55:37,387 --> 00:55:41,016
- For what? About time for what?
- Attack choppers. We're going after 'em.

724
00:55:46,529 --> 00:55:49,828
Goddamn it! Skip, don't do this!

725
00:55:49,899 --> 00:55:52,959
He's in an irrational state of mind!
His head isn't on straight.

726
00:55:53,036 --> 00:55:58,235
Fuck off, Marshal Larkin.
Your job's finished. This flight's full.

727
00:56:06,082 --> 00:56:10,951
Gentlemen, in roughly five hours, we will
be flying over the shores of Mexico,

728
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,955
but first we have to change aircraft.

729
00:56:14,023 --> 00:56:16,389
Thank you, and have a pleasant flight.

730
00:56:16,459 --> 00:56:21,522
- What's the ETA, Swamp Thing?
- At 228 miles an hour, about 71 minutes.

731
00:56:21,597 --> 00:56:25,328
The only problem is, we're not doing
228 miles an hour. We're doing 205.

732
00:56:25,401 --> 00:56:29,667
We're draggin', baby. The landing gear
ain't all the way up. We're gonna be late.

733
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:32,572
- No, Cyrus, that's unacceptable.
- Check out the gear.

734
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:35,509
- What the hell I know about landing gear?
- Learn.

735
00:56:43,186 --> 00:56:47,054
How are you doing there, Sally Bishop?

736
00:56:47,123 --> 00:56:50,058
Living out my fantasies, Poe.

737
00:56:50,126 --> 00:56:53,289
Hm. I'll bet.

738
00:56:53,362 --> 00:56:57,093
- You got a family?
- Got a cat.

739
00:56:58,234 --> 00:57:03,934
Had a husband, but he didn't like the cat,
so something had to give.

740
00:57:04,006 --> 00:57:06,133
Sounds like a tough choice.

741
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:11,913
In five years my cat never once got drunk
and embarrassed me in front of my friends.

742
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:16,178
In six years my husband never
purred when I touched him,

743
00:57:16,252 --> 00:57:18,550
so it wasn't a tough choice at all.

744
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:23,424
I sure could use one of them
pink snowballs right about now.

745
00:57:32,335 --> 00:57:34,064
Hillbilly!

746
00:57:34,137 --> 00:57:35,900
Poe.

747
00:57:40,276 --> 00:57:41,265
Yeah?

748
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:44,575
Cyrus wants you
to check out the landing gear.

749
00:57:44,647 --> 00:57:47,775
Then I'll get to see some nice scenery
whippin' by down there.

750
00:57:53,189 --> 00:57:55,123
Trees and stuff.

751
00:58:15,111 --> 00:58:18,410
Goddamn! So that's
what happened to Pinball.

752
00:58:18,481 --> 00:58:21,746
Cut him loose. He's slowin' us down.
Dead weight.

753
00:58:21,818 --> 00:58:23,809
Not exactly a proper burial.

754
00:58:24,453 --> 00:58:26,648
Look at our shit over there.

755
00:58:47,076 --> 00:58:48,475
Hurry up.

756
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,148
Hillbilly.

757
00:58:53,216 --> 00:58:54,877
Gotcha.

758
00:58:56,085 --> 00:58:58,679
Hurry up, man.

759
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,391
Bye, Pinball.

760
00:59:16,472 --> 00:59:20,374
<i>(# theme from "A Summer Place"
by Percy Feith & His Orchestra)</i>

761
00:59:20,443 --> 00:59:23,503
Oh, boy! You see that?
You see?

762
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:28,676
Every time I get her waxed, I get ten feet
from the car wash and then, pow, bird shit.

763
00:59:28,751 --> 00:59:31,345
Well, it's supposed to be good luck.

764
00:59:34,257 --> 00:59:36,817
- Light's changed.
- Oh, damn.

765
00:59:42,832 --> 00:59:44,891
<i>(screaming)</i>

766
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:02,180
- You were in the Q, right?
- Yeah.

767
01:00:02,251 --> 01:00:05,345
And I heard you say you had 15 years.

768
01:00:06,956 --> 01:00:08,617
That's right.

769
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:12,821
But then that would put you
on north block. Right?

770
01:00:12,895 --> 01:00:14,260
Yeah.

771
01:00:15,965 --> 01:00:18,593
Yeah. Funny thing.

772
01:00:18,668 --> 01:00:22,604
I was on north block.

773
01:00:22,672 --> 01:00:26,972
- I don't know you.
- Well, you know what, pal?

774
01:00:27,043 --> 01:00:31,571
What do you think that means?
Nothin'. Not diddly-shit.

775
01:00:31,647 --> 01:00:34,275
You see, there were 160 cats
on north block

776
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:38,684
and I didn't want to know 159 of them,
which included you.

777
01:00:38,754 --> 01:00:42,690
- What do you think about that?
- Yeah.

778
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:53,934
He's a font of misplaced rage.

779
01:00:54,003 --> 01:00:58,497
Name your cliché. Mother held him
too much, or not enough.

780
01:00:58,574 --> 01:01:02,066
Last picked at kickball,
late-night sneaky uncle. Whatever.

781
01:01:03,012 --> 01:01:06,948
Now he's so angry, moments of levity
actually cause him pain.

782
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,677
Gives him headaches.

783
01:01:09,752 --> 01:01:12,482
Happiness, for that gentleman, hurts.

784
01:01:13,556 --> 01:01:15,615
What's wrong with him?

785
01:01:15,691 --> 01:01:18,888
My first thought would be... a lot.

786
01:01:26,268 --> 01:01:28,133
- Hello.
- Hello.

787
01:01:28,204 --> 01:01:30,331
- Hi. I'm Vince Larkin.
- I'm Tricia Poe.

788
01:01:30,406 --> 01:01:33,967
Nice to meet ya.
This must be Casey.

789
01:01:34,043 --> 01:01:35,943
- Hello, Casey.
- Hello, Vince Larkin.

790
01:01:36,012 --> 01:01:37,741
Nice to meet ya.

791
01:01:37,813 --> 01:01:39,906
So how are you doin'?

792
01:01:39,982 --> 01:01:42,348
I'm sorry. Scratch that.
Dumb question.

793
01:01:42,418 --> 01:01:45,945
You wanted to see your husband today,
and then this whole thing happened.

794
01:01:46,022 --> 01:01:48,650
Maybe you could tell me
exactly what's going on here.

795
01:01:48,724 --> 01:01:52,455
We're doing everything we can
to get the plane down.

796
01:01:52,528 --> 01:01:55,622
Actually, that's why I wanted to talk to you.

797
01:01:59,735 --> 01:02:02,363
Hey, wait. Where'd you get the rims, man?

798
01:02:02,438 --> 01:02:05,168
Our personal shit's down in the belly.

799
01:02:07,176 --> 01:02:09,838
- Hey, those are my shades.
- They're mine now, sister.

800
01:02:09,912 --> 01:02:11,937
Men!

801
01:02:18,054 --> 01:02:21,990
It seems that your husband, Cameron,

802
01:02:22,058 --> 01:02:24,390
had an opportunity to get off the plane
and didn't,

803
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:30,763
and I was hoping you could
maybe help me figure out why.

804
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:33,358
That would make two of us.
I don't know.

805
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:36,500
I mean, it's possible... it's not uncommon

806
01:02:36,572 --> 01:02:39,700
that some parolees actually fear
their release date.

807
01:02:39,775 --> 01:02:43,302
A certain degree
of institutionalization sets in.

808
01:02:43,379 --> 01:02:45,279
Fear of coming home,
living in society...

809
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:47,076
- Any of this make sense?
- No, no.

810
01:02:47,149 --> 01:02:50,676
That's not Cameron. I mean,
if you knew him, if you read his letters,

811
01:02:50,753 --> 01:02:53,415
or if you talked to him
on the phone, you'd know that...

812
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:57,755
I mean, he's been waitin' for this day
for eight years. He's not gonna...

813
01:03:00,129 --> 01:03:04,589
I mean, look, he's got this little girl
to come home to.

814
01:03:06,569 --> 01:03:09,037
Wouldn't you...

815
01:03:09,105 --> 01:03:11,164
do the same thing?

816
01:03:13,909 --> 01:03:17,777
There'd have to be a pretty strong reason
to keep me on that plane.

817
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:20,338
Knowing Cameron,
I'm sure there is a good reason.

818
01:03:23,052 --> 01:03:27,318
Maybe, if you do see him
or if you talk to him,

819
01:03:27,389 --> 01:03:31,519
maybe you could just tell him
to come home, all right?

820
01:03:31,594 --> 01:03:34,085
Be kinda nice to have him around.

821
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:37,021
<i>- You got it.
- (knocking at door)</i>

822
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:40,294
Vince, line one.

823
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:44,505
This body fell out of the sky.

824
01:03:44,573 --> 01:03:49,010
Vince Larkin? This is Ted Grasso,
Fresno Police Department.

825
01:03:49,078 --> 01:03:52,536
<i>- We got a problem here with a corpse.
- Uh-huh.</i>

826
01:03:53,149 --> 01:03:56,607
Yeah, it fell out of the sky.
I don't think he's an astronaut.

827
01:03:56,685 --> 01:03:58,846
Then what's this got to do with me?

828
01:03:59,822 --> 01:04:02,518
It's got your name written all over it.

829
01:04:07,863 --> 01:04:10,559
Last transponder tag was in Arizona.

830
01:04:10,633 --> 01:04:13,124
Body falls here in Fresno.

831
01:04:13,202 --> 01:04:15,932
Lerner Airfield.
They're turning around.

832
01:04:16,005 --> 01:04:17,495
- Get me Chief...
- Devers.

833
01:04:17,573 --> 01:04:19,871
Please. Thank you.

834
01:04:19,942 --> 01:04:22,001
- Vince?
- Turn around.

835
01:04:22,077 --> 01:04:25,046
Plane's headed to Lerner Airfield.
It's 100 miles from here.

836
01:04:25,114 --> 01:04:28,948
Horseshit! We're tailing
the transponder tag into Arizona.

837
01:04:29,018 --> 01:04:31,350
Listen to me.
A body fell from the sky.

838
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,752
<i>It had a note on it.</i>

839
01:04:33,822 --> 01:04:36,950
We got 'em vectored
at 12:00 and 30 miles.

840
01:04:37,026 --> 01:04:41,190
- Vince, please, son. We're right on his tail.
- Just listen to me!

841
01:04:41,263 --> 01:04:43,527
It was to me!
The note on the body was to me!

842
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,829
- You're chasing the wrong...
- Aw, shut up.

843
01:04:45,901 --> 01:04:47,425
Hello?

844
01:04:48,704 --> 01:04:51,537
Guys, guys! I need a plane
or a chopper now!

845
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:53,575
Hey, you and me both.
I'm all out.

846
01:04:53,642 --> 01:04:56,873
I gotta get to Lerner Airfield
and I've got about 50 minutes.

847
01:04:56,946 --> 01:04:59,141
Got a fast car, you can drive it.

848
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:05,520
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
I'm with the Marshal Services.

849
01:05:05,588 --> 01:05:10,389
Send what you got - sheriff, state trooper,
National Guard. Hold on one minute.

850
01:05:13,495 --> 01:05:16,020
Your men should proceed
with extreme caution.

851
01:05:16,098 --> 01:05:18,566
It's a matter of time
before they find the weapons.

852
01:05:23,005 --> 01:05:25,838
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
Marshal Services.

853
01:05:25,908 --> 01:05:27,705
How do you think I got the number?

854
01:05:33,482 --> 01:05:36,679
"...appears to the United States
Parole Commission that..."

855
01:05:38,387 --> 01:05:39,513
Poe.

856
01:05:40,689 --> 01:05:43,988
Man! Oh, yeah!

857
01:05:45,661 --> 01:05:48,255
Put the bunny back in the box.

858
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:53,927
I knew you was a punk,
and I was right.

859
01:05:54,003 --> 01:05:59,805
You been playin' us all along.
You a free man.

860
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:06,371
I said, put the bunny back in the box.

861
01:06:37,513 --> 01:06:38,946
Die, punk!

862
01:06:47,856 --> 01:06:52,156
Why couldn't you
put the bunny back in the box?

863
01:06:54,029 --> 01:06:57,931
Next, folks, below and to your left,
you'll see the vertical Redwall cliffs.

864
01:07:00,769 --> 01:07:03,863
We're seconds away from
establishing visual contact.

865
01:07:05,774 --> 01:07:08,607
Holy shit!

866
01:07:08,677 --> 01:07:10,338
Abort! Abort! Abort!

867
01:07:11,914 --> 01:07:16,817
If that aircraft's carrying
30 prisoners, I'm Elvis Presley.

868
01:07:17,486 --> 01:07:22,321
"Uncle Bob's Scenic Tours."

869
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:23,255
Shit!

870
01:07:25,728 --> 01:07:29,664
300 fuckin' miles
to apprehend Ma and Pa fucking Kettle!

871
01:07:29,732 --> 01:07:34,897
We need to get to Lerner Airfield now!
Get me Vince Larkin.

872
01:07:45,214 --> 01:07:47,648
Two went down, one came up.

873
01:07:47,716 --> 01:07:50,981
- Wasn't my fault.
- Well, you don't have to tell me.

874
01:07:51,053 --> 01:07:53,817
Most murders are crimes of necessity
rather than desire.

875
01:07:53,889 --> 01:07:58,121
But the great ones -
Dahmer, Gacy, Bundy -

876
01:07:58,193 --> 01:08:02,459
- they did it because it excited them.
- Don't you...

877
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:06,865
I got nothing in common with them,
with you. Don't you talk to me!

878
01:08:06,935 --> 01:08:10,632
- They were insane.
- Now you're talking semantics.

879
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,901
What if I told you insane was working 50
hours a week in some office for 50 years,

880
01:08:15,978 --> 01:08:18,105
at the end of which they tell you to piss off?

881
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,978
Ending up in some retirement village,

882
01:08:21,049 --> 01:08:25,543
hoping to die before suffering the indignity
of trying to make it to the toilet on time.

883
01:08:27,389 --> 01:08:29,584
Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?

884
01:08:29,658 --> 01:08:35,358
Murdering 30 people,
semantics or not, is insane.

885
01:08:37,032 --> 01:08:40,968
One girl... I drove through three states
wearing her head as a hat.

886
01:08:41,036 --> 01:08:43,971
It's my daughter's birthday today,

887
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:47,338
so please feel free
not to share everything with me.

888
01:09:48,237 --> 01:09:52,003
All right, you damn peckerwoods,
crank the knuckles and hit the crystals.

889
01:09:52,074 --> 01:09:54,702
We're putting this baby down
in the sandbox.

890
01:10:03,685 --> 01:10:05,482
Lerner Tower, do you copy?

891
01:10:06,688 --> 01:10:09,816
<i>Lerner Tower. Are you there. Phil?</i>

892
01:10:14,563 --> 01:10:16,224
<i>Come on. Answer me.</i>

893
01:10:16,298 --> 01:10:18,357
<i>I am landing.</i>

894
01:10:47,195 --> 01:10:47,786
Oh, my God.

895
01:10:49,298 --> 01:10:49,889
Look out!

896
01:11:11,019 --> 01:11:11,644
We got it!

897
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:54,796
Stick her in the cage.
We don't want any distractions.

898
01:12:01,642 --> 01:12:03,473
Feel better now?

899
01:12:26,798 --> 01:12:29,824
Lerner Airfield.
I'm so glad to be here.

900
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:35,234
Thank you for choosing Con Air.

901
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:41,806
- Where's the plane, Francisco?
- I don't know. Have patience.

902
01:12:41,877 --> 01:12:45,779
The last guy who said to have patience -
I burned him down and bagged his ashes.

903
01:12:45,847 --> 01:12:47,815
Cyrus, it'll be here.

904
01:12:55,089 --> 01:13:00,550
Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!
Jesus Christ!

905
01:13:04,897 --> 01:13:07,457
I hope he likes sand.

906
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:10,229
<i>Muchacho. Check out the tower.
Have a look-see, yeah?</i>

907
01:13:10,301 --> 01:13:12,394
- All right.
- You come with us.

908
01:13:13,905 --> 01:13:16,840
How glamorous.
This place is perfect for me.

909
01:13:17,741 --> 01:13:21,609
- Nice landing. Very smooth, honey.
- Fuck you. We made it, didn't we?

910
01:13:26,315 --> 01:13:28,044
- We're gettin' off.
- I can't.

911
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:30,381
- Yes, you can. Come on!
- You shouldn't move him.

912
01:13:30,451 --> 01:13:33,352
- I'm getting him off of this plane.
- You can't move him.

913
01:13:33,421 --> 01:13:35,821
He's too far along.
He could go into shock.

914
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:38,154
She's right, Poe.
Go on, man.

915
01:13:38,225 --> 01:13:40,659
I'm not leaving without you, or you.

916
01:13:40,727 --> 01:13:43,662
Ah, listen. Here we go.
Ranger boy.

917
01:13:43,729 --> 01:13:47,062
- Right.
- Goddamn it, Poe!

918
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:49,692
Man, it's time to fight,
fuck, or hit the fence.

919
01:13:49,768 --> 01:13:52,236
- I suggest you hit the fence.
- He's right.

920
01:13:52,304 --> 01:13:54,636
Just go.

921
01:13:54,705 --> 01:13:58,163
All right. Here's how it's gonna play.
I'm gonna get you that needle.

922
01:13:58,242 --> 01:14:00,938
Whatever you say, man.
Just do what you gotta do.

923
01:14:01,011 --> 01:14:02,137
Fuck.

924
01:14:02,212 --> 01:14:05,443
All right, you just hang on.
Don't die on me.

925
01:14:05,648 --> 01:14:11,052
# Swing low, sweet chariot

926
01:14:11,153 --> 01:14:14,213
# Comin' for to carry me home

927
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:18,082
Oh, no. What the hell
you think you're doin'?

928
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,923
- It's time to off the pigs.
- You can't do that.

929
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:24,021
- Tell me why.
- They're hostages. We need 'em.

930
01:14:24,097 --> 01:14:28,898
- But why the fuck you care?
- Hey, man, come on.

931
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:32,904
I can't think of a thing I'd like better

932
01:14:32,972 --> 01:14:37,466
than to put a bullet in the brain base
of every one of these fuckers!

933
01:14:37,542 --> 01:14:40,340
But the fact of the matter is,
how well you know this Cindino?

934
01:14:41,613 --> 01:14:44,707
I mean, I don't know him that well myself.
Just what I read.

935
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:48,239
He firebombed that senator's yacht
with two of his own cousins on board.

936
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:50,252
So what's your point?

937
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,312
Why not kill some hired guns once they'd
served his purpose? Think about that.

938
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:59,487
- What exactly are we discussing here?
- Poe don't want me to off the pigs.

939
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,326
It's not difficult to surmise how
Nathan here feels about killing guards,

940
01:15:03,397 --> 01:15:11,202
and my own proclivities are well-known
and often-lamented facts of penal lore.

941
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:14,569
What I'm wonderin' is why you have
any opinion about it at all.

942
01:15:14,641 --> 01:15:17,303
Cyrus, this is your barbecue, man,
and it tastes good.

943
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:21,779
But I was just sayin' to Mr. Dog over here,
that if it was my barbecue,

944
01:15:21,846 --> 01:15:25,646
I'd wait for that old jumbo jet in the sky
before I start killin' our only leverage.

945
01:15:25,716 --> 01:15:28,480
- Shut the fuck up!
- Don't you want to get high and get laid?

946
01:15:28,551 --> 01:15:29,848
- Shit.
- Oh, fuck this!

947
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:33,548
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down, Nathan.

948
01:15:34,723 --> 01:15:37,317
Poe's right. We're goin' to Plan B.

949
01:15:37,394 --> 01:15:40,090
Gonna get a refueling truck
and a tractor.

950
01:15:40,162 --> 01:15:42,756
So get back there and dig the plane out.

951
01:16:11,622 --> 01:16:12,748
No.

952
01:16:15,592 --> 01:16:18,152
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.

953
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:53,086
Viking, about time to go
and get that tractor, yeah?

954
01:16:53,157 --> 01:16:54,624
Right.

955
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:59,027
- I'll get the fuel truck.
- Thanks, Poe.

956
01:16:59,097 --> 01:17:01,793
You've proven to be
a most useful mammal.

957
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:05,561
"Many hands make light work."
My daddy taught me that.

958
01:17:05,635 --> 01:17:08,297
- You know what my daddy taught me?
- What's that?

959
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:10,930
- Nothin'.
- Self-educated man.

960
01:17:14,809 --> 01:17:18,245
- Have you found Vince Larkin?
- We're having trouble reaching him, sir.

961
01:17:18,312 --> 01:17:20,507
Of course you're having trouble
reaching him!

962
01:17:20,581 --> 01:17:25,780
He's off saving the rain forest,
or recycling his sandals or some shit.

963
01:17:53,609 --> 01:17:58,808
All right, girls! It's Miller time!
Take yourselves a break. Cigarettes!

964
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,075
We got whiskey!

965
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:04,449
- Whoa, shit!
- Give me that!

966
01:18:04,519 --> 01:18:06,680
- Want me to break this up?
- No, leave 'em be.

967
01:18:06,753 --> 01:18:10,621
You know how happy they are when they
get somethin' that doesn't belong to 'em.

968
01:18:18,197 --> 01:18:20,665
Holy shit!

969
01:18:25,235 --> 01:18:30,434
<i>(whistles) Hey! We got company!</i>

970
01:18:30,507 --> 01:18:32,600
Hey!

971
01:18:32,675 --> 01:18:35,235
We got company!

972
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:39,411
Go get Cyrus.

973
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:41,142
Yo, Cyrus!

974
01:18:48,089 --> 01:18:52,856
- How long we got till they get here?
- Ten, 12 minutes, tops.

975
01:19:02,501 --> 01:19:04,935
Hi, what's your name?

976
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:07,531
<i>(laughs)</i>

977
01:19:17,646 --> 01:19:19,614
Nice jet.

978
01:19:19,682 --> 01:19:22,810
You can take Cindino and leave
the rest to rot for all I care.

979
01:19:22,885 --> 01:19:26,912
You fire that weapon, 20 pissed-off
prisoners are gonna hear it.

980
01:19:26,989 --> 01:19:29,583
<i>Comprendé. Ese?</i>

981
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:34,892
Well, hooray for the sounds
of fuckin' silence.

982
01:19:35,629 --> 01:19:36,687
Freeze!

983

<i>(exhales)</i>

- You're Cameron Poe.
- That's right.

985
01:19:59,215 --> 01:20:01,183
- I'm Larkin.
- Hello, Larkin.

986
01:20:02,118 --> 01:20:04,382
- I got your message.
- Where are the troops?

987
01:20:04,454 --> 01:20:07,218
- They'll be here.
- "They'll be here"?

988
01:20:07,289 --> 01:20:13,853
Uh-huh. In a minute.
Listen, Poe, can I lower this?

989
01:20:13,928 --> 01:20:17,022
- Go ahead.
- You gonna lower yours?

990
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:20,261
Sorry, boss,
but there's only two men I trust.

991
01:20:20,334 --> 01:20:22,894
One of them's me.
The other's not you.

992
01:20:24,771 --> 01:20:28,571
- Cindino was running a drag on everyone.
- Yeah.

993
01:20:28,641 --> 01:20:31,474
If you can't trust a South American
drug lord, who can you trust?

994
01:20:33,878 --> 01:20:36,346
- That was a joke.
- I'm glad you told me.

995
01:20:36,414 --> 01:20:39,611
Now I gotta get back to the plane.

996
01:20:39,683 --> 01:20:42,584
You're a free man, Poe.
What are you doin'?

997
01:20:42,654 --> 01:20:45,987
I can't trade a friend's life
for my own, Larkin. That's all.

998
01:20:46,056 --> 01:20:48,854
You got a friend on board?

999
01:20:48,925 --> 01:20:52,793
See, I knew I was right about you.
I read your file.

1000
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:55,887
You're not a bad guy. Just in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

1001
01:20:56,599 --> 01:20:58,624
Goodbye, Larkin.

1002
01:21:00,635 --> 01:21:03,433
I spoke to your wife.

1003
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:11,935
- In person?
- In person.

1004
01:21:12,879 --> 01:21:15,177
And your little girl.

1005
01:21:16,982 --> 01:21:19,951
You saw Casey?

1006
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,552
Uh-huh.

1007
01:21:24,522 --> 01:21:29,755
If this thing goes bad, Larkin,
I'm afraid my daughter won't understand.

1008
01:21:30,794 --> 01:21:36,357
If you talk to my wife again,
you tell her... I love her.

1009
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:41,092
She's my hummingbird.

1010
01:21:41,169 --> 01:21:45,902
But I couldn't leave a fallen man behind.

1011
01:21:48,308 --> 01:21:50,936
You'll do that for me, won't you, Larkin?

1012
01:21:51,012 --> 01:21:55,005
Sure I will.
What are you gonna do for me?

1013
01:21:55,849 --> 01:22:00,343
What do you think I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna save the fuckin' day.

1014
01:22:14,598 --> 01:22:18,295
Let's go, gentlemen.
The cavalry is on its way.

1015
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:20,233
I want this airplane out now.

1016
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:23,468
Come on, men!

1017
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:42,020
- About another ten minutes.
- You said ten minutes ten minutes ago.

1018
01:22:45,257 --> 01:22:47,691
Hello, Bob.
Wanna come over for dinner?

1019
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,724
Are you sick?

1020
01:22:55,967 --> 01:22:59,130
- Why do you ask?
- You look sick.

1021
01:23:00,837 --> 01:23:03,806
- I am sick.
- You take medicine?

1022
01:23:03,874 --> 01:23:06,672
There is no medicine for what I have.

1023
01:23:08,144 --> 01:23:11,011
- Wanna sing?
- Sing?

1024
01:23:11,079 --> 01:23:13,707
Do you know "He's Got
the Whole World in His Hands"?

the ground, but it won't be for long.

- I'm not gonna kill you, old-timer.

- Listen, I need a syringe.
- Oh, no! Drugs'll end you, son.

1047
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:43,851
Is there a first-aid kit around here?

1048
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:46,657
There might be one
in the fire truck over on the boneyard.

1049
01:26:46,729 --> 01:26:51,189
All right, thanks.
You just stay here and don't panic.

1050
01:26:51,266 --> 01:26:54,394
That's easy for you to say.
You don't gotta take a piss.

- Oh, yeah, that's nice.

01:27:16,288 --> 01:27:19,917
Considering my audience, I'm gonna
make this very quick, very simple.

1053
01:27:19,992 --> 01:27:23,985
This is the boneyard.
This is the hangar.

OK.

1057
01:27:31,635 --> 01:27:35,036
The convoy will enter
the boneyard through here.

1058

Initially, we take out the first car,
then we take out the last,

1200
01:41:58,582 --> 01:42:02,814
All right, we'll need police cars,
fire engines, emergency service vehicles.

1201
01:42:02,885 --> 01:42:05,217
Anybody who knows CPR.

Cyrus, wake up!

I'm outta here!

Before I kill you, Poe,
I just wanted you to know

Oh...

How am I doing, son?

1216
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:03,800
You're doing fine.
We just gotta get you a doctor.

1217
01:45:03,873 --> 01:45:06,808
I'll get one.

1218

You know I'm still coming
to that barbecue, right?

1219

Of course you are.

You did real good.

1222
01:45:22,455 --> 01:45:24,184
Ow!

1223
01:45:32,163 --> 01:45:35,690
Check you out at the hospital, son.
You're gonna be fine.

1224
01:45:58,886 --> 01:46:02,481
- Yeah, this one's dead.
- We better get him outta here.

1225
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,352
So what are you gonna do now?

1226
01:46:08,427 --> 01:46:14,332
I started this day with a birthday party
to get to, and I'm gonna get to it.

01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:25,875
- Thank you.
- You take care, Sally Bishop.

Hey, Poe.

1229
01:46:30,046 --> 01:46:32,640
Next time, take the bus.

1230
01:46:39,855 --> 01:46:43,552
Come on, sweetie.
Go with Ginny and your mom.

1231
01:46:50,397 --> 01:46:52,729
- Cyrus.
- Grissom.

1232

Yeah, sure. How about this?

1238

You ain't gettin' near
my daughter. Buckle up.

1239

Just so's you know, Marshal Larkin,

1240
01:51:31,737 --> 01:51:35,468
there's now three men I trust.

1241
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:38,008
Am I one of 'em?

1242
01:51:47,383 --> 01:51:50,443
This is a weird thing to be
on a plane full of hard asses.

1243
01:51:51,786 --> 01:51:53,447
- You OK?
- No.

1244
01:51:53,521 --> 01:51:56,012
Good. I'm glad we didn't
shoot it down, huh?

1245
01:51:56,090 --> 01:51:58,581
Oh, yeah, worked out
much better this way.

1246
01:52:00,027 --> 01:52:02,291
Listen, I...

1247
01:52:02,362 --> 01:52:05,354
I wanna apologize about the car.

1248
01:52:05,431 --> 01:52:09,697
I know a good body shop
in Fresno if it's insured.

1249
01:52:09,769 --> 01:52:12,670
- I was bored with that car anyway.
- It worked out nicely then.
