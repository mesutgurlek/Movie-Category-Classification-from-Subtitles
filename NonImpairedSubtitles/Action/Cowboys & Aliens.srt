1
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,361
We're riding towards Absolution.

2
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:29,188
You know how far west we are?

3
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,981
Maybe he's a dummy.

4
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,903
Is there a reason you're not
answering my question?

5
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:46,358
Look here Pa.
He's got iron on his wrist.

6
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:48,290
He's been shot.

7
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,560
Could be he done broke out of hoosegow.
Might be worth bounty-money.

8
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,255
That could be.

9
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:04,517
It's not your lucky day, stranger.

10
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,480
Turn around and start walking.

11
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:12,271
I said turn around
and start walking.

12
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:04,418
Get out.

13
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,068
Hello?

14
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,317
Balls to heaven, friend.

15
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:40,591
Easy now.

16
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:50,592
Alright, turn around,
nice and slow.

17
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,461
I've been shot.

18
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:01,786
Only two kinds of men get shot.

19
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:04,618
Criminals and victims.

20
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:07,460
Well, which one are ya?

21
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:09,550
I don't know.

22
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:12,503
You got a name, friend?

23
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't know that either.

24
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,573
Well, just what do you know?

25
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:20,156
English.

26
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:31,369
Well, that... That's a right
odd-looking wound there.

27
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,200
Looks almost cauterised.

28
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,052
Now this might sting a bit.

29
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:43,140
There you go.
- Is this a mining town?

30
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,831
Yeah. Well, that was the notion.

31
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,259
People moved on though...

32
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,218
...for gold.

33
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:57,206
Alright now, try and hold still.

34
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:01,792
There we go.

35
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:05,452
This is no gunshot.

36
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,430
Where did ya get this, son?
- I don't know.

37
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:13,184
Well I can't rightly absolve you of your sins,
If you don't recall now, can I?

38
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:16,961
That being said, I've seen
good men do bad things

39
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:19,615
bad men do good things.

40
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:22,865
Whether you're gonna end up
in heaven or hell...

41
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:25,956
it's not God's plan,
that's your own.

42
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:29,188
You just gotta remember
What it was.

43
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:32,426
Alright, put your finger
right here. Come On.

44
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:34,818
There you go.

45
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:42,164
There.
- Thank you.

46
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:44,958
Not bad for a country preacher.

47
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:54,234
It's that damn fool Dolarhyde kid.

48
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,391
Hey, hey hey hey!
What are you doing?

49
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,272
Percy, there's people out there.

50
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:01,026
There's no-one out there, it's fine.

51
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,328
It's not fine. It's bad enough
he drinks for free...

52
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,493
..and now he's gonna shoot up the place?

53
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:07,131
Hey what was that, doc?

54
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:10,616
Nothing. He didn's say anything.
Everything's okay. -Go back inside.

55
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,359
Shut up.

56
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:18,045
I wanna hear what you said.
It's bad enough... what?

57
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,320
Are you ungrateful for our business?

58
00:11:22,426 --> 00:11:24,887
Because if it wasn't
for my Pa's cattle,

59
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:27,048
There'll be no money going
through this town

60
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:29,782
And there would be no
meat on your tables

61
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:33,251
And your doors would
be closed. Huh?

62
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:36,640
I don't mean no disrespect to your
father, Percy. You know that.

63
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,390
Of course not. But you ask me to pay.

64
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,263
Come here, let's settle up.

65
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:47,089
Come here.

66
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:57,505
Hey kid, I do not want any trouble.
I'm just trying to...

67
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,004
Better pick up your glasses, doc,
before someone steps on them.

68
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:16,443
Alright son, we're just trying
to make a living now.

69
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,257
You know what, preacher?
You just gave me an idea.

70
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:23,702
I know it ain't Sunday, folks, but...

71
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:27,861
What say we take up a collection
for the poor man, huh?

72
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:30,728
Now who's got money?

73
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,115
In the hat.

74
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,522
Let's go, much obliged.

75
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:42,580
I'm sorry, doc's bad fortune has to
be taken out on you good people.

76
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:45,985
That's mighty Christian of you.

77
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:51,973
Hey!

78
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,079
You too.

79
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:59,526
You wanna be careful where you
point that thing before you get hurt.

80
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:08,560
Listen, eh...

81
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:14,363
I'm gonna give you the benefit
of the doubt, because...

82
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:18,224
Maybe you don't know who I am.

83
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,724
Leave me alone.

84
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:35,175
Hey, you!

85
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:38,205
I'm warning you.

86
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:55,072
Where the hell did he come from?

87
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,121
What the hell's going on here?

88
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:01,372
Well, it was an accident.

89
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:04,737
He came out of nowhere.
And he dry gulched me.

90
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:07,159
He tried to make me look like a fool.

91
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,192
It wasn't my fault, Sheriff.

92
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:11,815
Damn it, Percy. You've crossed
the line this time.

93
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:12,860
I gotta lock ya up.

94
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,732
Taggart.

95
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,735
You know that's not a good idea.

96
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:20,497
Well I'm afraid I got no choice, Ned.

97
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:27,763
Ned? Ned, you son of a bitch,
where are you going?

98
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,072
Don't worry. I'll tell your father
about what happened today.

99
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,797
Don't ruin the coffee there, yankee.

100
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:42,573
Well, tell you what Ed.
The next time you can have coffee.

101
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:46,302
- Okay, alright. -Hey why don't you take
it easy on that tileslacking, Murphy.

102
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,411
Mr. Dolarhyde don't like
drinking on the job.

103
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:51,969


104
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:58,492
I don't give a rat's ass wat the high and
mighty Colonel Dolarhyde don't like.

105
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:02,247
I don't care how many Indians he put under neither.

106
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:05,948
You sure do slap your guns a lot
when the boss ain't around.

107
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:13,253
I'd say it to his face if he was here!

108
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,746
Colonel Dolarhyde.

109
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,226
Let me tell you something, boys.

110
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:29,294
Money makes you soft.

111
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:08,346
Where the hell is that coach?

112
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:12,236
- Coach? What coach?
- You shot a deputy, Percy.

113
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:15,013
Federal Marshal's bringing
you to Santa Fe.

114
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:19,060
Federal Marshal?
Sherriff, have you lost your mind?

115
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:22,312
My pa is on his way down here.

116
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:25,093
you better let me out of here,
before things get out of hand.

117
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:28,815
Sheriff, it was an accident.

118
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:31,259
it's not like I'm Jesse James..!

119
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,119
Son of a bitch.

120
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:37,654
Hey, -your whisky
- can you put that on Percy's tab?

121
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:41,210
Fifty cents.

122
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:43,933
Just kidding with you there, pal.

123
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:49,634
Have they no respect in this town?

124
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:51,470
That's not true, okay?

125
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,174
- You wanna leave?
- No.

126
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:57,958
This is your dream.
I'd follow you anywhere.

127
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,191
I thought it was our dream.

128
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,155
God dammit!

129
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,693
Charlie, why don't you play
something festive!

130
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:08,455
It's like a funeral in here.

131
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,186
Hey. You don't have to
prove anything, okay?

132
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,943
Okay? I love you!

133
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:20,790
I'm not sure how.

134
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:35,642
Whisky.

135
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:43,648
On the house, for what you did.

136
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,499
I'm just here to drink.

137
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:13,035
Do I know you?
- No.

138
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:20,440
My name is Ella.

139
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:25,829
Where did you get your bracelet?

140
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:30,324
Is there something you
know about me maybe?

141
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:35,138
You do not remember anything, do you?

142
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:40,276
What do you want?

143
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:42,682
I know that you're looking for something.

144
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:45,205
So am I.

145
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,486
Well, good luck to you.

146
00:18:57,314 --> 00:18:59,475
Move away.

147
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:09,999
Jake Lonergan.

148
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:33,462
Follow me to the office, so
we can have us a little chat.

149
00:19:36,446 --> 00:19:39,060
I think you've got the wrong man.

150
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:44,376
Well, I'm gonna need you to
come with us all the same.

151
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:50,190
Wouldn't do that if I was you.

152
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,291
I don't want any trouble.

153
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:08,396
Rise and shine.

154
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,685
You're in trouble now..!

155
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:15,745
You're gonna burn.

156
00:21:15,745 --> 00:21:18,631
here, my pa is coming for me.

157
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:23,878
He learned how to kill a man
good, and slow. In the war.

158
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:27,300
I am gonna watch you suffer...

159
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:33,761
...for a long, long time.

160
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:39,554
You thought that cheap shot
in the pecker hurt, huh?

161
00:21:47,646 --> 00:21:51,377
Please. I didn't steal your cow.

162
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:54,741
Colonel Dolarhyde, you've
gotta believe me.

163
00:21:57,051 --> 00:22:00,904
You've only been riding for my
bran for what, two weeks?

164
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,511
You don't maybe know whom
you're dealing with, Roy.

165
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:12,502
Nobody calls me Colonel.

166
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:16,133
And them who that did are mostly dead.

167
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,885
Please.

168
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:26,572
So you had little Mickey's picking
up strays. How many did you get?

169
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:29,124
About forty-four of 'em, boss.

170
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:31,427
You've been drinking, ain't
ya? I can smell it on ya.

171
00:22:31,427 --> 00:22:34,728
I haven't been drinking nothing.
You said it yourself, we shouldn't do drinking.

172
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:39,316
What kind of a man goes 'round
blowing up other peoples cows,

173
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,272
then tells a bullshit story like this?

174
00:22:42,272 --> 00:22:46,291
You could't do no better?
- You gotta believe me, there was a white light.

175
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,884
This bright light.

176
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:50,285
So there was this big light...

177
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,234
and you fell in the river, and
when you come back...

178
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:56,682
two of my best hands
has just disappeared.

179
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,271
There weren't no storm...

180
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,758
There weren't no lightning this evening.

181
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:06,725
You don't respect me, do you Roy?

182
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:11,847
Where's Percy?

183
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,733
- Taggart locked him up, boss.
- Why?

184
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:18,712
- What did he do now?
- Shot a deputy.

185
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:20,597
God dammit.

186
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:23,426
What the hell does Taggart
think he's doing?

187
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:25,620
He wouldn't even have a job...

188
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:28,844
Now I gotta go in there
and reason with him...

189
00:23:28,844 --> 00:23:32,120
...because you failed to
look after my boy.

190
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,778
Thank you. Thank you.

191
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:43,500
Alright. Everybody saddle up.

192
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:51,101
Boss, we oughta get more hands.

193
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:53,672
- Why?
- You're not gonna believe this.

194
00:23:53,772 --> 00:23:56,511
I think Jake Lonergan is in town.

195
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,666
I'm turning you over to the Federal Marshal.

196
00:24:12,488 --> 00:24:14,864
You're gonna tell me
what I'm charged with?

197
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,961
Arson, assault, mayhem...

198
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,302
hijacking...

199
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,390
It says you robbed the stage last month.

200
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,261
With Pat Dolan and Bull McCade.

201
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:33,260
Which makes you an accesory
to everyone they broke, too.

202
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:41,822
- Is that it?
- Murder.

203
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,178
Prostitute out in Cottonwood Grove
has con you over.

204
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:49,242
Name of Alice Wills.

205
00:24:50,384 --> 00:24:52,976
You saying I killed this woman?

206
00:24:52,976 --> 00:24:54,930
You tell me.

207
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:40,661
Oh damn.

208
00:25:44,514 --> 00:25:46,532
Gimme your wrist.

209
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:49,518
Taggart, what are you doing?

210
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:53,912
Sheriff, this is going to far, I....

211
00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:57,223
I was just fooling around.

212
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,828
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

213
00:26:00,885 --> 00:26:03,791
- Go away.
- Listen I'm sorry.

214
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:06,233
But I had no choice.
I couldn't let you leave.

215
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,687
Well, I'm leaving now.

216
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,317
- I need you.
- If you have got something to say, say it.

217
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,313
I need to know where you came from.

218
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:19,789
So do I.

219
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,828
Ma'am...

220
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:30,963
You gov'ners have a nice trip now.

221
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,667
Taggart. Taggart, let me out of here.

222
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:38,163
Sheriff.

223
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:40,462
Sheriff..!

224
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:43,010
What are you doing?

225
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,178
You get back home. Go to bed.

226
00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:50,005
- Please, do not go.
- I have to, Emmett. It's my job.

227
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:53,190
I don't like it here.

228
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:57,152
Now your pa is getting things in order
and when he does, he'll send for you.

229
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,285
It's been a year.

230
00:26:59,553 --> 00:27:01,638
Don't worry, he will.

231
00:27:03,002 --> 00:27:05,532
And your mom is buried here.

232
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,948
And you know I can't leave my little girl.

233
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:18,261
- Taggart.
- Yeah, I see them.

234
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:21,091
You go inside.

235
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:42,749
I want my boy, John.

236
00:27:48,727 --> 00:27:51,118
- I knew you'd come for me, Pa.
- Shut up.

237
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:53,427
i'll deal with you later.

238
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:57,520
Yes, that's Lonergan, boss.

239
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:04,998
That's the son of a bitch who
stole my gold, off the coach.

240
00:28:04,998 --> 00:28:06,493
I want that man.

241
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:08,929
You're gonna have to take it
up with the judge in Santa Fe.

242
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:12,879
I ain't going to Santa Fe.
You give him to me now.

243
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:14,752
Or I'm gonna take him.

244
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:17,996
- What about me, pa?
- I said shut up, boy.

245
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:59,099
What the hell is that?

246
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:20,203
What the hell...?

247
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:05,664
- It's coming back!
- He's coming around.

248
00:30:05,815 --> 00:30:07,691
This one.

249
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,864
- Do not move.
- Wait for me.

250
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:38,132
- Give me your hand.
- What's going on?

251
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:40,042
- Give me your hand.
- What the hell for?

252
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:43,292
I'll get us free.
Give me your hand.

253
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:05,600
Emmett. Come on son.

254
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,254
Grandpa!

255
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,392
- Gimme your hand.
- No!

256
00:31:14,654 --> 00:31:16,804
Come on, kid. Give me your hand.

257
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,965
What is that?

258
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:03,560
Get up, boss.

259
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,347
- Come on, we gotta get out of here.
- Where's Percy?

260
00:32:10,215 --> 00:32:13,448
- Come out of there.
- I can't, pa. -Can't?

261
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:15,635
Coward.

262
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:34,356
- What is that thing?
- Why are you asking me?

263
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:36,859
Since you shot us.

264
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:40,478
- Where did you get this thing?
- I do not know.

265
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:44,833
What do you mean you do not know?

266
00:34:50,678 --> 00:34:53,025
What the hell is that?

267
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,653
It took my wife.

268
00:35:00,313 --> 00:35:02,129
Hey!

269
00:35:02,129 --> 00:35:04,473
Is anyone in there?

270
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:08,406
- No. -Is my wife in there?
- No!

271
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:11,159
Is it dead?

272
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,854
- Is it demons?
- Demons?

273
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:26,089
Can't rightly say. Sure does
fit the description but uh...

274
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:29,597
Demons? What are you talking
about? Bible stuff -demons?

275
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:31,933
- I'm not talking about anything.
- What the hell are you talking about?

276
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:34,364
- You gotta calm down, Doc.
- Calm down?

277
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:37,006
You're telling me that a bunch of demons took my wife?

278
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:40,081
- I didn't say any such thing.
- Took our people...

279
00:36:03,316 --> 00:36:04,879
Boss.

280
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:08,452
Boss, it went this way.

281
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:14,726
I do not know what it is, but it's bleeding.

282
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:21,661
It's in the same direction those
machines went with our kin.

283
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:24,789
We're not gonna be able
to track it in the dark.

284
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:30,355
Round up the horses, get some supplies.
We set off first light.

285
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:33,139
You...

286
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:36,938
...You're going with us.

287
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,177
I need that weapon, it's
the only thing that counts.

288
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:43,138
I figure you owe me.

289
00:36:43,846 --> 00:36:46,248
I don't see it that way.

290
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:58,389
What do you want?

291
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:00,515
What do you want?

292
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,924
Just tell me right now, or I'll kill you.

293
00:38:03,924 --> 00:38:06,147
They took my people, too.

294
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:08,743
I've been looking for them a long time.

295
00:38:08,743 --> 00:38:11,039
I know you can help me find them.

296
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,850
You stay away from me.

297
00:38:26,457 --> 00:38:28,660
I can help you.

298
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,735
It's heading north.

299
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:41,532
It's tracks are still fresh.

300
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:57,043
- If it's all the same, I'd ride along too.
- Yes, ma'am.

301
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,375
We got a kid and a dog,
why not a woman.

302
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:51,093
You're back.

303
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:08,176
What is that?

304
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:28,188
- you have to take it back.
- Like hell I will.

305
00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:29,573
- That's blood money.

306
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:32,338
- Well I didn't goddamn harm anyone.
- By robbing and killing.

307
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:34,810
That's gonna get us what we need.

308
00:41:06,895 --> 00:41:09,176
- Jake. -Stay there.
- Jake.

309
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:43,692
Well, well, well.

310
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,812
Look who's back.

311
00:41:46,442 --> 00:41:48,705
I'm seeing you, but I don't see my gold.

312
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:51,969
Well let's say we find
those people first huh?

313
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:54,674
And then you can take your
best shot at collecting.

314
00:41:54,674 --> 00:41:58,704
Maybe that reward on your head would
be a more attractive proposition.

315
00:41:58,704 --> 00:42:03,460
Or I could just shoot you in the chest
and cut that thing off your arm.

316
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:07,630
You know Doc, I don't even
know why we're doing this.

317
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:10,404
You know, they're all dead.

318
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:14,607
Well, if think if they wanted to
kill 'em I think they would have.

319
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:18,473
Well if.. if the boss is right,
they was roping 'em...

320
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,461
...then it's to eat 'em.

321
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:25,076
If it's me, I'd start with your wife.

322
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:29,211
Are you gonna be like this the whole trip?

323
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:33,057
Cause if you are, I pay it you´re not gonna have too
many long conversations, are we?

324
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:36,168
Why don´t you just sing a song or something.

325
00:42:36,168 --> 00:42:39,114
Cook some beans. Do something useful.

326
00:42:48,415 --> 00:42:50,648
Take some friendly advice?

327
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,966
You get yourself a gun,
and learn how to use it.

328
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:05,472
Tracks are washed away.

329
00:43:34,973 --> 00:43:37,144
I dont know much about boats...

330
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,534
...but I'd say that one is upside-down.

331
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:44,577
Five hundred miles from any river,
big enough to hold it.

332
00:43:45,228 --> 00:43:47,344
Well let's get inside,
get out of the rain.

333
00:43:47,344 --> 00:43:49,467
I'm not going anywhere near that thing.

334
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:52,578
Suit yourself.
Sleep in the rain.

335
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:24,992
You're fixin' to say something?

336
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:30,750
Maybe ... maybe we should
have called in the army?

337
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,306
I ain't going to turn this
over to no WestPointers


338
00:44:33,306 --> 00:44:37,159
gotta get on the telegraph, ask
Washington which hand to wipe with.

339
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:41,431
we waited around to ...
for them to tell me what to do.

340
00:44:43,438 --> 00:44:46,435
I lost 328 men.

341
00:44:46,657 --> 00:44:49,078
over a cornfield.

342
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:53,071
I remember the stories.

343
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:58,752
I don't recollect telling
you any stories.

344
00:44:59,138 --> 00:45:03,447
I'd listened when you tell them to Percy.

345
00:45:03,876 --> 00:45:07,921
Yoy get this through
your thick Indian skull...

346
00:45:09,982 --> 00:45:13,691
The stories weren't for you.

347
00:45:15,137 --> 00:45:17,885
They were for my son.

348
00:45:20,058 --> 00:45:24,091
Now get out of here.
Go look after the horses.

349
00:45:24,384 --> 00:45:26,803
Do your job.

350
00:46:04,685 --> 00:46:08,121
You've been looking at this knife.
Do you like this knife?

351
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:24,120
You look after that.

352
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:27,783
Don't lose it.

353
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,587
Don't yank on that,
it's not your pecker.

354
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:41,604
Now here. Look -you're holding on to
this thing like you're hanging from it.

355
00:46:45,976 --> 00:46:48,062
What the hell am I doing?

356
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:54,548
It's my fault she got took, I never
should have taken her to that town.


357
00:46:54,548 --> 00:46:56,635
Oh, no no no. It's not your fault.

358
00:46:56,755 --> 00:47:00,622
You'll get her back. You're setting things
right. You just gotta have faith, that's all.

359
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:02,096
- Faith?
- Hm, hm.

360
00:47:02,096 --> 00:47:04,811
Yeah. Captain, real swell to me.

361
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:08,264
I don't mean no disrespect
preacher, but He ain't up there...

362
00:47:08,364 --> 00:47:10,348
or He don't like me very much.

363
00:47:10,348 --> 00:47:14,286
Well surely you don't expect the Lord
to do everything for you, do you Doc?

364
00:47:15,472 --> 00:47:17,959
You gotta earn His presence.

365
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:19,529
And then you gotta recognise it...

366
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:21,696
and then you gotta act on it.

367
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:25,703
Now keep your eye on the target.

368
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:28,687
And shoot.

369
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,794
That's better, better. Come on.

370
00:47:36,894 --> 00:47:38,673
Let's reload.

371
00:48:00,082 --> 00:48:02,154
You've been there long?

372
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:04,087
Yes.

373
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:16,583
Is there something you need?

374
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:19,496
Who is she?

375
00:48:22,037 --> 00:48:26,582
- She's the only one who knows who I am.
- You know who you are.

376
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:29,805
- You just have to remember.
- Well I can't.

377
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,390
Yes you can.

378
00:48:47,326 --> 00:48:49,387
Does it hurt?

379
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,213
It's fine.

380
00:49:01,616 --> 00:49:03,485
It's here.

381
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:43,586
Easy easy, Rafani. Easy.

382
00:49:43,586 --> 00:49:45,562
What's wrong boy?

383
00:49:45,562 --> 00:49:47,861
Hello?

384
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,521
Get away from that boy!

385
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:21,967
No!

386
00:51:49,961 --> 00:51:51,936
The boy.. the boy!
- He's fine.

387
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:56,492
It's okay, it's okay.

388
00:51:59,734 --> 00:52:02,399
You go get our people back.

389
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:07,166
Don't let anybody tell you worse, son.

390
00:52:07,438 --> 00:52:10,340
Only you know who you are.

391
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:41,241
Dog.

392
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:44,022
Come on, boy.

393
00:52:45,273 --> 00:52:47,351
Where are you?

394
00:52:49,185 --> 00:52:51,172
Tracks are good, it's headed north.

395
00:52:51,365 --> 00:52:55,436
- Where's the men?
- They've run off. God damn cowards.

396
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:56,912
I can't find the dog.

397
00:52:56,912 --> 00:53:00,846
We ain't waiting for 'm, he has
run of or dead. Let's go.

398
00:53:00,846 --> 00:53:04,852
Hey, hey wait. Aren't we
gonna say some words?

399
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:07,480
The only one who knows
what to say, is under ground.

400
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:10,517
Ain't it enough, we took the
time to put him there?

401
00:53:10,518 --> 00:53:12,826
No. no, it's not enough.

402
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,368
You go ahead.

403
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:32,598
Ah, Lord, er..

404
00:53:34,792 --> 00:53:37,703
If there is such thing as a soul...

405
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:40,145
This man had a good one,
Please protect it.

406
00:53:40,857 --> 00:53:44,526
Made me feel better. The world
was a better place for having him.

407
00:53:45,105 --> 00:53:47,714
Dust to dust, amen. How's that?

408
00:53:47,954 --> 00:53:50,045
Good words.

409
00:53:59,808 --> 00:54:02,224
What are you all choked-up about?

410
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,391
I'm worried about my grandpa.

411
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:15,898
Look, when I was only just a little
bit older than you are now...

412
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,620
All of this was Mexico.

413
00:54:19,885 --> 00:54:24,004
the word had come that the Apaches
was riding towards the settlement

414
00:54:24,004 --> 00:54:26,238
Called... Jerauaca.

415
00:54:27,104 --> 00:54:28,957
My father wanted me to be a man...

416
00:54:28,957 --> 00:54:32,928
so he made me ride out with the garison,
bangin' on the drum.

417
00:54:35,194 --> 00:54:37,635
Boy was I scared.

418
00:54:40,158 --> 00:54:42,652
Well, we got there, it was too late.
and they were all dead.

419
00:54:42,652 --> 00:54:45,101
The place was all burnt down.

420
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:48,652
This one settler fell out.

421
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,580
He came crawling out of a burning cabin.

422
00:54:53,908 --> 00:54:55,998
He was burned.

423
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:58,743
He knew he was gonna die.

424
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,865
He was burned bad.

425
00:55:03,594 --> 00:55:05,654
He rolled over...

426
00:55:06,214 --> 00:55:08,806
looked up into my eyes...

427
00:55:09,558 --> 00:55:12,674
He said: kill me.

428
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:17,084
What did you do?

429
00:55:21,724 --> 00:55:24,829
I took this knife off his belt...

430
00:55:25,379 --> 00:55:28,131
and I slit his throat.

431
00:55:29,602 --> 00:55:31,627
Take it.

432
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,766
Be a man.

433
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,913
That's a little rough isn't it?

434
00:55:48,472 --> 00:55:50,502
- He means well.

435
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:08,288
I got him.
The tracks are closer together.

436
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,289
He's slowing down and headed for that canyon.

437
00:56:32,474 --> 00:56:34,753
Put your hands up in the air!

438
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:40,086
That means you too, pretty lady.

439
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:44,061
This is what they call a hold-up.

440
00:56:44,186 --> 00:56:46,233
Welcome everybody.

441
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:48,031
Welcome.

442
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,293
Boss?

443
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:56,597
Boss, is that you?

444
00:56:57,602 --> 00:57:01,426
Lonergan, what the hell are you doing here?

445
00:57:03,556 --> 00:57:05,283
Patron.

446
00:57:05,972 --> 00:57:09,078
Who are your uh, amigos?

447
00:57:11,154 --> 00:57:13,808
This is your new 'gang' gang?

448
00:57:17,296 --> 00:57:20,251
I never thought I'd see you again, Jake.

449
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:25,125
You were always my favorite.

450
00:57:25,512 --> 00:57:27,290
Shut up.

451
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,693
Jake, did you break my tooth?

452
00:57:32,803 --> 00:57:35,382
Would you shut up? I'm thinking.

453
00:57:38,874 --> 00:57:41,238
How many boys have we got left?

454
00:57:42,299 --> 00:57:44,663
About the same.

455
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:49,694
- Which is...
- Thirty?

456
00:57:49,694 --> 00:57:53,821
That's right. Thirty. Good.

457
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,601
That's good.

458
00:57:58,771 --> 00:58:01,627
You're gonna bring me to the camp.

459
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,013
You just gotta know how
to set things straight.

460
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,966
Ah, we're gonna go to the camp!

461
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,834
How's the haul?
- Gopher-mine gold.

462
00:58:12,934 --> 00:58:14,999
They're looking pretty rich.

463
00:58:15,307 --> 00:58:18,666
- How much dynamite have we got?
- About fifty sticks or so.

464
00:58:18,747 --> 00:58:20,620
Dolan.

465
00:58:23,743 --> 00:58:26,055
'Bout time you got back.

466
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:29,850
- What the hell happened to you?
- He er...

467
00:58:36,923 --> 00:58:39,264
Well, shit.

468
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,799
You've got some balls.

469
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,479
Riding back in here like nothing ever happened.

470
00:58:48,985 --> 00:58:52,623
Boys. Grab your guns.
We're riding out.

471
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:56,323
Boys aren't going anywhere with you, Jake.

472
00:58:57,523 --> 00:58:59,913
We've fixed 'em to rob us a coach.

473
00:59:00,018 --> 00:59:02,877
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

474
00:59:09,906 --> 00:59:12,105
Are you her?

475
00:59:12,401 --> 00:59:14,140
Am I who?

476
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,822
The whore, that Jake quit this gang for.

477
00:59:18,251 --> 00:59:20,923
- You watch your mouth.
- Or what?

478
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:24,669
I run this outfit now.

479
00:59:24,669 --> 00:59:26,170
Put your guns on the whore.

480
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:30,385
If he so much as twitches, blow
her brains out of her ear.

481
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:36,595
He said the whore.

482
00:59:37,263 --> 00:59:40,799
You call her a whore again, it'll be
the last word you'll ever say.

483
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,052
You are in no position to make threats.

484
00:59:44,521 --> 00:59:46,817
Hunte, take his gun.

485
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:49,095
Take his gun.

486
00:59:50,335 --> 00:59:52,950
I'm sorry, Jake.

487
01:00:11,596 --> 01:00:13,837
Where is our gold, Jake?

488
01:00:14,863 --> 01:00:17,016
I don't remember.

489
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,536
Well, I do remember.

490
01:00:26,713 --> 01:00:30,595
You're telling us you is leaving us
high and dry because of some woman.

491
01:00:41,902 --> 01:00:47,497
I guess you just left out the part about taking
all of our gold from that last job, huh?

492
01:00:48,572 --> 01:00:51,185
So I'm gonna ask you one last time.

493
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:54,771
Where is it, Jake?

494
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:58,476
Demons.

495
01:01:00,863 --> 01:01:04,973
- What's that?
- Demons took your gold.

496
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,773
When you get to hell...

497
01:01:08,987 --> 01:01:12,245
you can ask for it back.

498
01:01:20,096 --> 01:01:22,364
Kill the whore.

499
01:01:35,482 --> 01:01:38,416
I told you not to call her that.

500
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:41,486
Everybody. Drop 'em!

501
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:44,806
I said, drop 'em!

502
01:01:51,596 --> 01:01:53,258
How fun is it?

503
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:57,275
You know... that wasn't very nice..!

504
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,429
- On your horses.
- Go.

505
01:02:04,018 --> 01:02:07,411
Jake Jake, don't forget your gun.

506
01:02:07,588 --> 01:02:10,366
You'll always be my favorite.

507
01:02:18,508 --> 01:02:21,124
Get 'em! Ride!

508
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:52,561
- They're here.
- Move out.

509
01:03:11,502 --> 01:03:13,262
Come on!

510
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:27,231
Okay I got ya. I got ya!

511
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:44,466
Can you swim?

512
01:04:49,146 --> 01:04:51,941
- Oh God.
- Turn your head.

513
01:05:15,915 --> 01:05:17,457
Are you alright?

514
01:05:22,234 --> 01:05:24,075
Let's get in.

515
01:05:43,643 --> 01:05:47,317
- We were flying.
- Yeah.

516
01:05:48,857 --> 01:05:51,412
- I don't want to do that again.
- No.

517
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:05,904
Hey.

518
01:07:05,904 --> 01:07:08,415
Hey, you stay with me.

519
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:11,233
Keep talking.

520
01:07:12,073 --> 01:07:14,644
You remember now, don't you?

521
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,994
- What?
- The woman.

522
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:22,906
Did you love her?

523
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:28,022
- You can tell me.
- I can't remember.

524
01:07:28,617 --> 01:07:30,283
I mus have...

525
01:07:30,999 --> 01:07:33,246
All I know is that I owe it to her.

526
01:07:33,962 --> 01:07:36,496
I still have to find her.

527
01:07:38,998 --> 01:07:42,131
Sorry. I'm Sorry.

528
01:07:43,573 --> 01:07:47,107
I got ya. I got you.

529
01:07:51,754 --> 01:07:53,735
It's not far now.

530
01:07:55,645 --> 01:07:57,151
You and me...

531
01:07:58,299 --> 01:08:00,902
...We're gonna be just fine.

532
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:11,016
Is that.. is that them?

533
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:13,309
Boss!

534
01:08:22,587 --> 01:08:25,911
- I got it. -Give her to me Ned.
Bring her here.

535
01:08:30,866 --> 01:08:34,849
- Here.
- No... give it to her.

536
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,552
Doc?

537
01:08:57,112 --> 01:08:59,098
How is she?

538
01:09:00,968 --> 01:09:04,044
- She's gone.
- No.

539
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:09,910
She's not gone. She's ...
NOT GONE!

540
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:12,925
Jake.

541
01:09:13,564 --> 01:09:15,712
She's gone.

542
01:09:49,472 --> 01:09:51,511
- Doc.
- That's it.

543
01:09:51,811 --> 01:09:53,736
Doc!

544
01:10:28,929 --> 01:10:31,606
This is Black Knife.

545
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:35,224
There's no reasoning with them.

546
01:10:35,224 --> 01:10:38,503
We're all gonna die anyway.
- This is what's left of the Chiricajas.

547
01:10:38,503 --> 01:10:40,067


548
01:10:41,014 --> 01:10:44,863
He saying the white people, they
brought all this evil to his people.

549
01:10:44,863 --> 01:10:47,576
WE brought evil?
Evil was HERE!

550
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:48,788
You're the evil one.

551
01:10:48,788 --> 01:10:51,247
He saying we've brought the monsters.

552
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:55,412
We didn't bring the monsters.
Tell him they took our people too.

553
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,747
- Tell him that they took my wife.
- There is no reasoning with 'em.

554
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:10,501
Sorry, but I could't tell you.

555
01:12:10,749 --> 01:12:12,983
- Are you one of them?
- No.

556
01:12:13,105 --> 01:12:15,425
I'm from a different place.

557
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,373
I took this form, so I could walk among you.

558
01:12:19,891 --> 01:12:21,583
Well, you should have told me.

559
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:24,414
I didn't know if I could
heal this body.

560
01:12:24,414 --> 01:12:26,990
If I would wake up.

561
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:40,632
He wants to know where you're from.

562
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:55,244
- What did she say? -She came from
a place above the stars.

563
01:12:55,244 --> 01:12:59,209
What do you mean, another world?
What does that mean?

564
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,632
- What?
- He says you shouldn't talk.

565
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:03,257
What do you mean I shouldn't
talk, I got questions.

566
01:13:04,535 --> 01:13:06,663
- You're a guest of the chief.
- Oh now I'm a guest?

567
01:13:06,663 --> 01:13:08,901
I thought I was a prisoner.

568
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:11,449
You're both big men, great warriors.

569
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:14,754
Can we just listen to the woman tell her story?
Or whatever she is?

570
01:13:14,754 --> 01:13:16,265
What are they doing here?

571
01:13:16,305 --> 01:13:18,328
They want gold.

572
01:13:20,273 --> 01:13:23,660
Well that's just ridiculous. What are
they gonna do, buy something?

573
01:13:23,917 --> 01:13:26,628
It is as rare to them, as it is to you.

574
01:13:26,846 --> 01:13:28,752
- What about my grandpa?
- What about my wife,

575
01:13:28,752 --> 01:13:32,374
what about the other people,
are they still alive?

576
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:34,635
If they are, they won't be for long.

577
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:38,656
They're studying your weaknesses.

578
01:13:38,938 --> 01:13:40,815
These are just scouts.

579
01:13:40,815 --> 01:13:42,782
If we let them leave,
they'll come back with more

580
01:13:42,782 --> 01:13:45,440
and there will be no survivors.

581
01:13:46,191 --> 01:13:48,350
It's what they did to my people.

582
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:51,025
I came here to make sure it
would not happen again.

583
01:13:51,025 --> 01:13:53,641
But we have to work together.

584
01:13:59,788 --> 01:14:02,851
He says his people will join her.

585
01:14:02,851 --> 01:14:05,677
What do you mean, join her? What's she
gonna do? Where are you gonna go?

586
01:14:05,677 --> 01:14:08,115
We can find them. He knows where they are.

587
01:14:12,145 --> 01:14:14,129
No I don't.

588
01:14:14,873 --> 01:14:18,083
I can't remember anything.
I can't even remember my own name.

589
01:14:21,546 --> 01:14:24,477
He says they will take care of that.

590
01:16:49,087 --> 01:16:54,361
I brought the gold to the house.

591
01:16:55,357 --> 01:16:58,295
It's where she died.

592
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,137
It's not your fault.

593
01:18:09,866 --> 01:18:12,361
I know where they are.

594
01:18:58,222 --> 01:19:00,628
Jesus, Mary and Josef.

595
01:19:02,361 --> 01:19:05,698
- How did they build something like that?
- They arrived in it.

596
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:07,749
It's their vessel.

597
01:19:07,749 --> 01:19:11,665
That's only the top, the rest is under
ground. It's how they mine for gold.

598
01:19:11,665 --> 01:19:14,052
So there is gold here.

599
01:19:14,372 --> 01:19:16,322
Can they see out of here?

600
01:19:16,322 --> 01:19:18,061
They don't see well in daylight.

601
01:19:18,061 --> 01:19:21,302
They stay under ground,
in caverns where it's dark.

602
01:19:51,433 --> 01:19:53,152
We never even gonna get close.

603
01:19:53,152 --> 01:19:56,704
These flying machines will pick us
off before we even get near it.

604
01:19:56,704 --> 01:19:59,320
There is another way in.

605
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:03,014
Down there. The way I came out.

606
01:20:04,903 --> 01:20:07,881
We gotta get those creatures
out of there, out in the open.

607
01:20:07,959 --> 01:20:09,832
where we can get at them.

608
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:14,073
So you can get in there with that
arm gun, get our people out.

609
01:20:15,203 --> 01:20:18,350
We have one advantage.
They underestimate you.

610
01:20:18,453 --> 01:20:20,394
You are like insects to them.

611
01:20:20,394 --> 01:20:24,016
The're not planning on defending
themselves, so they'll be vulnerable.

612
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:28,175
- We do not have enough men.
- Obviously they ain't gonna walk.

613
01:20:32,637 --> 01:20:35,857
He says he wants to use
your spyglass.

614
01:21:01,928 --> 01:21:04,552
The Apaches are mountain warriors.

615
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:08,039
He says it is better to fight from high ground.

616
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:11,626
Tell him he's a fool.

617
01:21:11,626 --> 01:21:14,760
There's no high ground while
they've got those flying machines.

618
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:17,028
Jake's leaving.

619
01:21:23,955 --> 01:21:25,497
Well that's just dandy.

620
01:21:25,497 --> 01:21:28,092
Son of a bitch.

621
01:21:30,255 --> 01:21:33,324
- Quit stalling, how much gold we have left?
- Barely enough.

622
01:21:33,324 --> 01:21:37,741
But I'm gonna take my share right now, so I can
get as far away from here as I possibly can.

623
01:21:40,434 --> 01:21:43,650
- Red.
- I have got him, Bull.

624
01:21:49,554 --> 01:21:52,831
Well I had one hell of a job finding you boys.

625
01:21:54,356 --> 01:21:56,363
Are you planning a trip?

626
01:21:59,112 --> 01:22:01,326
We're going as far away as we can go.

627
01:22:01,326 --> 01:22:04,887
- Remember la playa in Porto Vallarta?
- Yeah, you got good fishing.

628
01:22:05,661 --> 01:22:08,405
Good tequila, you wanna come with us?

629
01:22:08,405 --> 01:22:10,467
It will make no difference.

630
01:22:11,747 --> 01:22:13,931
It's not far enough.

631
01:22:15,575 --> 01:22:18,025
Well they ain't worse things, Jake.

632
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:21,502
Doesn't matter. They're gonna find us.

633
01:22:22,127 --> 01:22:24,340
And they're gonna wipe us out.

634
01:22:24,619 --> 01:22:26,871
What in the hell are you saying?

635
01:22:27,738 --> 01:22:30,312
What I am saying is, you have got a choice.

636
01:22:31,109 --> 01:22:33,878
You can drink your last few
hours away on a beach...

637
01:22:33,878 --> 01:22:37,904
...which, by the way, is not a bad idea...

638
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:41,602
...or you can follow me one last time.

639
01:22:52,028 --> 01:22:55,127
We've gotta make the best use of our resources.

640
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:58,216
We've gotta need a strategy.
Listen to me dammit!

641
01:22:59,255 --> 01:23:02,472
He doesn't understand jack.
You've got to explain to him.

642
01:23:02,629 --> 01:23:05,921
Look, we can't just run around hollering

643
01:23:05,921 --> 01:23:09,624
and throwing spears and shooting
arrows at the damn thing.

644
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:13,655
We gotta draw them outta there,
onto open ground.

645
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:17,161
Where we can surround them,
attack them on all sides.

646
01:23:17,161 --> 01:23:19,383
Flank 'em.
Explain to him.

647
01:23:23,173 --> 01:23:26,166
He said he's not gonna let you lead his people.

648
01:23:36,447 --> 01:23:38,504
What's he saying?

649
01:23:39,869 --> 01:23:43,854
He saying they need to open their hearts
and see in you what he has seen.

650
01:23:49,735 --> 01:23:52,670
When his parents died in the Mexican war...

651
01:23:53,014 --> 01:23:55,861
...when you took him in when he was only a boy.

652
01:23:58,588 --> 01:24:01,261
That you gave him purpose.

653
01:24:01,342 --> 01:24:04,110
of how to take care of himself.

654
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:06,473
Even though youre not blood.

655
01:24:10,966 --> 01:24:13,236
That you despise battle.

656
01:24:17,515 --> 01:24:21,244
and you're a fierce warrior, worthy of any fight.

657
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:44,943
He says if you're such a great warrior, why do you
only have a man and a boy to follow you into battle.

658
01:25:19,947 --> 01:25:21,496
Dog.

659
01:25:21,836 --> 01:25:23,268
Dog!

660
01:25:39,338 --> 01:25:41,381
Hot damn.

661
01:25:42,368 --> 01:25:44,983
Are you ready to get
your son back?

662
01:27:17,484 --> 01:27:19,186
Matches.

663
01:27:30,167 --> 01:27:33,246
I don't know how we're going about this,
we're gonna have to go down...

664
01:27:33,246 --> 01:27:35,242
...I don't know what we're gonna do.

665
01:27:41,988 --> 01:27:44,184
Go.

666
01:27:57,483 --> 01:27:59,256
Go. Go!

667
01:28:38,635 --> 01:28:41,196
I think we've destroyed it.

668
01:28:52,756 --> 01:28:54,780
Demons are coming around us.

669
01:28:58,629 --> 01:29:00,524
Take this and go up where I showed you.

670
01:29:00,524 --> 01:29:02,347
When you see our people, wave your arms.
- Yes, sir.

671
01:29:02,347 --> 01:29:04,256
Move out.

672
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:19,478
Good job.

673
01:29:19,478 --> 01:29:22,432
Good people you have in there.
I'll get them out.

674
01:29:23,004 --> 01:29:24,653
God speed.

675
01:29:25,437 --> 01:29:27,268
Let's go!

676
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:42,335
This is how they get the gold out.

677
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:09,252
They are not going down!
- They will.

678
01:31:09,252 --> 01:31:12,487
Keep at it.
Then we get our people out.

679
01:32:13,579 --> 01:32:15,350
Doc.

680
01:32:15,618 --> 01:32:18,050
Doc, get down here.

681
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:22,324
Jesus.

682
01:32:24,332 --> 01:32:26,205
Doc!

683
01:32:26,843 --> 01:32:29,245
Did we get one?

684
01:32:29,899 --> 01:32:32,167
Yeah, we got one.

685
01:32:33,593 --> 01:32:38,625
I've always dreamed of
riding into battle with you.

686
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:44,597
I always dreamed of
having a son like you.

687
01:32:48,173 --> 01:32:51,483
Go. Get Percy.

688
01:32:52,116 --> 01:32:54,813
Get your son.

689
01:34:22,432 --> 01:34:24,961
Don't look into the light.

690
01:34:59,675 --> 01:35:02,463
I told you not to look into the light.
- You're right.

691
01:35:22,059 --> 01:35:25,535
How long are they gonna be like this?
- Each one is different.

692
01:35:30,843 --> 01:35:33,844
Hold them off.
- You better hurry.

693
01:36:14,094 --> 01:36:15,957
There´s more of them coming.

694
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:52,793
Go.

695
01:37:16,929 --> 01:37:18,676
Everybody is out.

696
01:37:19,107 --> 01:37:20,814
Right.

697
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:24,146
Hey, where are you going?

698
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:27,100
It is this way.

699
01:38:16,763 --> 01:38:18,712
Dog, come on.

700
01:39:53,375 --> 01:39:55,745
What the hell are you doing?
We have to get out of here.

701
01:39:55,745 --> 01:39:57,600
No

702
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,647
I came here to destroy that thing.
- How?

703
01:40:01,148 --> 01:40:05,098
- The bracelet. Take it off.
- I can´t take it off.

704
01:40:05,098 --> 01:40:07,483
- Yes you can, you can control it.
- How?

705
01:40:07,483 --> 01:40:10,092
The same way you shoot it, with your mind.

706
01:40:10,997 --> 01:40:13,662
You have to stop thinking.

707
01:40:24,122 --> 01:40:25,952
This isn´t gonna work.

708
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:43,190
It fell off.

709
01:40:52,355 --> 01:40:55,459
If I can get it to it´s core, I can stop them.

710
01:40:58,091 --> 01:40:59,899
Let´s go.

711
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:13,149
Take this.

712
01:41:38,512 --> 01:41:40,248
Throw it!

713
01:41:45,073 --> 01:41:47,693
Goodbye, Jake.
- What?

714
01:41:48,162 --> 01:41:50,495
What? No!

715
01:42:53,395 --> 01:42:57,732
I see them. They got out.
They´re coming out through the side.

716
01:42:57,732 --> 01:42:59,928
Do you see Percy?

717
01:43:03,232 --> 01:43:06,064
- Yeah, I see him.
- What about Jake and Ella?

718
01:43:06,286 --> 01:43:08,715
No, they´re not there.

719
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:09,598
Are you alright old man?

720
01:46:18,417 --> 01:46:20,977
- Where's the girl?
- She´s still inside.

721
01:48:52,533 --> 01:48:54,475
Grandpa.

722
01:48:54,901 --> 01:48:56,962
It's me.

723
01:48:58,474 --> 01:49:01,076
Emmett.
- Emmett.

724
01:49:06,826 --> 01:49:09,270
You´re all grown up.

725
01:49:16,301 --> 01:49:18,306
Percy.

726
01:49:22,791 --> 01:49:25,605
Don´t you remember me, boy?

727
01:49:25,913 --> 01:49:30,496
I´m sorry, I don´t remember much.

728
01:49:31,036 --> 01:49:33,434
I'm your father.

729
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:35,917
Oh Pa.

730
01:49:45,881 --> 01:49:48,475
Do you remember me?

731
01:50:01,409 --> 01:50:04,681
I thought you were dead.

732
01:51:47,111 --> 01:51:49,773
If there was gold, we could
have made things different.

733
01:51:50,729 --> 01:51:53,515
We´re gonna have a railroad in here soon.

734
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,976
That´ll change the cattle business.

735
01:51:59,405 --> 01:52:02,594
Run these ledgers back to the bank for me, will you?

736
01:52:02,594 --> 01:52:05,543
The foreman needs some new checks.

737
01:52:05,986 --> 01:52:07,671
Okay.

738
01:52:09,143 --> 01:52:13,046
I want the new ones to read "Dolarhyde and Son".

739
01:52:16,133 --> 01:52:18,475
Sound good to you?
- Yes.

740
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:21,612
Eh, yes, sir.

741
01:52:32,261 --> 01:52:35,385
John.
- Woodrow.

742
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:39,687
Guess our town is about to get a whole lot bigger.

743
01:52:45,189 --> 01:52:48,441
You weren´t gonna leave without
saying goodbye, were you?

744
01:52:51,571 --> 01:52:53,890
I am a wanted man.

745
01:52:54,468 --> 01:52:59,693
I could have sworn I saw Jake Lonergan
die in those caves, didn´t you, Sheriff?

746
01:52:59,693 --> 01:53:03,997
Damn shame. And I was looking
forward to hanging him myself.

747
01:53:05,659 --> 01:53:09,007
- I could use a good man around here.
- Yes you could.

748
01:53:14,595 --> 01:53:16,804
Jake.

749
01:53:17,964 --> 01:53:20,694
She´s in a better place.

750
01:53:23,868 --> 01:53:26,476
I´ll see you around, Colonel.

751
01:53:48,992 --> 01:53:50,920
The End.
