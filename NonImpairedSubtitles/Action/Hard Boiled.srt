1
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:47,849  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So, is your wife worried about you?
-There's nothing to be worried about.

2
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:52,051  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She prays for me whenever l'm on a
job. -Hold onto a woman like that!

3
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:04,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good morning! Up so early? -Yes!
How many Playboys have you read?

4
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:09,608  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Read? l just look at the centerfold.
-Chung! Are the ''Birds'' here yet?

5
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:12,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Three are, but the ''King Bird''
hasn't shown. -Keep watching!

6
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:39,207  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lionheart, are you receiving me?
-Go ahead!

7
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:43,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's happening?
-The invasion is about to begin!

8
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
OK. Let's get real.
We're not here to fool around.

9
00:03:57,627 --> 00:04:02,530  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have you ever considered
emigrating? -No. This is my home.

10
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf l'm going to die,
l want to be buried here.

11
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:08,167  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l couldn't get used to living abroad.

12
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:11,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To have early tea time--
impossible.

13
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:16,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There are Chinese restaurants
abroad. -But we got the original.

14
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:31,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How old is your son?
-Seven. Here's his picture, look.

15
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Got some great birds.
-No shit.

16
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:45,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Of course, or l wouldn't buy them.

17
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:10,127  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Chinese-made guns, brilliant. The pigs
won't know what hit them. -l like that.

18
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,860  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Very good price,
'cause they're made in China.

19
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:16,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But they can bust through two oil
drums, come out and kill a guy.

20
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, yeah, you selling us shit?
-We don't sell no shit!

21
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:40,060  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This'll make us all rich.

22
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:49,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My treat.
-Here.

23
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,511  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Police! Freeze!
-Nobody move!

24
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:30,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you all right?
-Yeah. Go.

25
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out of the way, asshole.

26
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:11,448  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch out! Get down!
Get down!

27
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:03,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get down!

28
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:21,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't come in!

29
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:24,410  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you hurt bad?

30
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out!

31
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, well done.
You're such an asset.

32
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give the guy a gun and he's Superman.
Give him two and he's God.

33
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:05,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you know who you've
just killed there?

34
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:10,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One of my key witnesses. l've hunted
this jerk for a long time.

35
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,687  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But l wanted him alive.
And l nearly had him!

36
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, thanks to you,
l'll never have him.

37
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:29,055  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's a shame. A pity.
-What is?

38
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That we didn't nail these jerks.

39
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:38,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've changed, Tequila. You were
so sensitive in cadet college.

40
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:39,808  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're so hard now.

41
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:47,338  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Too hard now?
-They're even harder.

42
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:52,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Had a good friend in him.

43
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:56,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We can't have everything in life.

44
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:37,387  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alan, l...

45
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mr. Hui wants to know
why you betrayed him.

46
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:49,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen, l didn't betray him,
honestly. -Yeah, you did.

47
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:23,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you remember what happened?
-lt was all so fast.

48
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:25,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt was more like a dream.

49
00:16:28,744 --> 00:16:32,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's the story?
-Dead for about two hours.

50
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:34,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shot at close range,
no resistance.

51
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:39,245  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anyone find the gun? -Not yet.
You know, this guy looks familiar.

52
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:41,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've seen him on the
Wanted list, l think.

53
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:57,182  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give it to me in half an hour.
-Right.

54
00:18:57,926 --> 00:19:00,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The dead guy was Malay Chinese.
Terrorist history:

55
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:04,496  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
arms dealing between '78 and '81
in Asia and North Africa.

56
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,966  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore--
they all want to get hold of him.

57
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,765  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Came to Hong Kong in '85
to smuggle arms.

58
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:13,703  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He used to work for Hui, but that
ended when Johnny Wong bought him out.

59
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:16,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We know the murder weapon was a
Davis .32 according to the files.

60
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:19,547  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We have no one on record
that would use one.

61
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:22,346  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Afraid that's all l have here.

62
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,847  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What a drag this is,
l can't even afford a pigsty.

63
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:29,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's no way l can.

64
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How can l get hitched without a
decent place for the boss to live?

65
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:40,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just because l'm single,
l can't get Government housing.

66
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:45,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'll take to the streets.
-You can stay at the YMCA,

67
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
three hundred a day, discount
for long stayers. -Why not try it?

68
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:54,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Jazz bar, l'll stay there! -Least you'll
get plenty of ''sax'' there.

69
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:58,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who's sending your woman
these exquisite flowers?

70
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:02,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's had a lot of them lately.
-ls that illegal?

71
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:14,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ma'am, more flowers for you.

72
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:45,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l need help.

73
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:49,366  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My love life's falling apart.
My lady and l aren't getting along

74
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:51,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
these days.
So, please, try and help.

75
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:54,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you. l'd really
appreciate a new pad too.

76
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:57,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tequila.

77
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:09,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's with all these?
You sick or something?

78
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:14,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm sick, all right.
-ls it a broken heart?

79
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:18,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Play your cards right and l'll
come back. -Wonderful!

80
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:21,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l can hang around a few more
years hoping you'll grow up.

81
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:23,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l didn't know
you liked white roses.

82
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:27,133  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, you wouldn't.
-You never told me.

83
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:30,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l never told him either, but he's
more interested in me than you are.

84
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:32,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen to him.

85
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:39,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He asks if you're lonely
and do you need a man for anything?

86
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:42,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l can read.
l just want the tune. Thanks.

87
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:15,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anything else?
-Nothing.

88
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:20,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've got the things you left
behind. Want them?

89
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:24,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your underwear.

90
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:35,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She seems pretty happy
with the flowers. -Really?

91
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:39,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Didn't know she liked roses.
-You'd better send some of your own.

92
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:41,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf she's good, l will.

93
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:44,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it?

94
00:22:52,294 --> 00:22:53,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tone deaf and dumb.

95
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:20,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''Lion near trap
stop the investigation.''

96
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:25,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Superintendent, what's up?

97
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's going on with
that arms case?

98
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
At this moment,
not very much at all.

99
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:37,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, keep at it.

100
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hulk! Come here.
-Coming!

101
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, what is it?
-l'm full already.

102
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nonsense.
Hungry guys don't work well.

103
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:12,906  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Beef jerky.

104
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:17,844  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Smart work you did in the library.
-lt's my job.

105
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:22,609  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Alan, don't forget who left
the gun there. -Good guy.

106
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's why he needs to eat, right?

107
00:24:25,454 --> 00:24:28,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mr. Hui treats us like kids,
always at us to eat more.

108
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:35,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm an old-timer. And l know
that respect and face are vital.

109
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:42,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm old-fashioned.
-lt works, though. We respect you.

110
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:51,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alan, if l did something bad,
how would you treat me?

111
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:55,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's worse guys than you around.

112
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:00,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's just an idea.
Why not go and check out Hawaii?

113
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:03,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You might like it.
Perhaps you could stay?

114
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:05,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You could have a new home maybe.

115
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:09,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l was born in this place
and l'll die here.

116
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:17,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alan, l've got responsibilities.
l can't just pack up and leave.

117
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:22,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l thought you might like it.

118
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Keep an eye on this little eel.
You can never trust him.

119
00:25:34,122 --> 00:25:37,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My apologies. Here, nothing
in my hands. -Mine are full.

120
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:45,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What? What's up?
-Johnny says he wants a word.

121
00:25:55,377 --> 00:25:58,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
South America wants its arms. We
don't have them. What can we do?

122
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,609  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Use another supplier. lf we
can't get it together, who can?

123
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:07,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't want to make a scene.
Let the teahouse incident die down.

124
00:26:07,823 --> 00:26:09,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This way, please.

125
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:12,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Johnny, can you trust Alan?

126
00:26:13,628 --> 00:26:17,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Got to risk it. Jimmy needs replacing.
Life's about taking chances.

127
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:21,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How's it going?
Sorry we're late, Johnny.

128
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:26,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is Alan. No need
for introductions, is there?

129
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,771  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Funny we've never met.
l've known about you for ages.

130
00:26:28,944 --> 00:26:31,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm antisocial.
-Too busy for the high life? Sit.

131
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:35,777  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right. l'll be frank,
l like your style.

132
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:39,053  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you happy with old Hui?
-Yes, l am.

133
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:43,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alan, you should set
your sights higher.

134
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
With your talents you should
be making big bucks.

135
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:48,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My arms business is real money,
it's worldwide.

136
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:51,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wherever there's war,
there's Johnny.

137
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:54,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Most things go in and out of
fashion--except war, my friend.

138
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:58,062  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When l say real money,
l mean it.

139
00:27:00,108 --> 00:27:03,737  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everyone knows you have the Midas
touch. -Will l have you as well?

140
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:06,844  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf Mr. Hui's alive,
l'm loyal to him.

141
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good. l like loyalty.

142
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:21,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l paid out a fortune to get
that Jimmy working on my side.

143
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,858  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And he brought a lot of
potential business with him.

144
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:26,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You wasted him with one bullet.

145
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:35,608  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ability like that is rare.
l forgive you.

146
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,541  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, l respect honesty.

147
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:45,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But l came here today
to get to know you.

148
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:49,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm not here to discuss business.
-You got it. l still like your style.

149
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:06,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who the fuck did that?
Wait till l get them! Bastards!

00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:44,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pissant! Listen up punk. You murdered
a cop, a guy in the teahouse.

156
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:48,171  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

killed a lot of innocent customers.

00:28:50,085 --> 00:28:54,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

159
00:29:01,596 --> 00:29:04,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hi there, pal. A souvenir.

160
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:11,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

best place to kill him.

161
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:15,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leave it.

162
00:29:52,714 --> 00:29:54,409  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't want it?

163
00:29:54,983 --> 00:29:58,612  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Or too small for you?
What a waste!

164
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:03,724  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm waiting for the big one.
-Real smart, guy. lt'll cost you.

165
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:06,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How much do you think?
-Hundred grand.

166
00:30:07,295 --> 00:30:10,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The police wouldn't cough it up.
Thirty.

167
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

168
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:18,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

169
00:30:19,374 --> 00:30:21,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

to stay away from cops.

170
00:30:23,878 --> 00:30:27,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

171
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:31,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is the spot. Be careful
with that jerk, Tequila.

172
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,378  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's not quite sane.

173
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:38,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'll see you after the fireworks
at the jazz bar. -Right.

174
00:30:41,963 --> 00:30:46,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

175
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:48,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

176
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:54,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

177
00:30:57,012 --> 00:30:59,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

178
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:12,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ma'am, more roses have come.

179
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:41,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Call the armory right now and
get us all kitted out for tonight.

180
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:44,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't we need Pang's say-so?
-l say so.

181
00:31:47,062 --> 00:31:49,292  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello? Armory?
Lionheart here.

182
00:31:49,464 --> 00:31:53,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My boss wants heavy-duty
issue for tonight.

183
00:31:53,368 --> 00:31:56,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, l'll get them later.
Don't ask, tell you later.

184
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:08,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''Don't ever bite
your own tail again.''

185
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:20,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will we need more back-up? -No,
it's not a war, we can handle it.

186
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,456  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, you two. Out, out, out!
-Yes sir.

187
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:29,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Two cops had their guns
stolen. Check it out.

188
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:32,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And lay off the gun-running job.

189
00:32:35,577 --> 00:32:38,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've spent God knows how many hours
working on this bloody case.

190
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:41,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And you tell me to lay off?
-You shut up!

191
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just get on with it, right?

192
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:46,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe you'd like to do an encore.

193
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:49,879  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Enjoying the performance?

194
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:54,258  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is my office.
Show me some respect.

195
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:56,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This may be your goddamn
office, Tequila.

196
00:32:56,531 --> 00:32:58,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But the whole station's mine.

197
00:33:03,905 --> 00:33:08,171  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know, you're really full of
shit. The toilet's over there.

198
00:33:33,735 --> 00:33:36,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

201
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:46,213  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right. What can l say but yes?

203
00:34:57,952 --> 00:34:59,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're moving the guns tonight.

204
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:22,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Raid my own boss's arsenal?
-Got it. And kill him as well.

205
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:24,942  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

206
00:35:25,346 --> 00:35:27,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

if we can be partners.

207
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:32,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'd be one hell of an asset.

208
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:38,653  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Either we conquer the world,
or you kill me tonight with this.

209
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:41,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No regrets, either.

210
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,127  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l have my own.

211
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,448  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mr. Hui, it's a raid!

212
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:51,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, come here.

213
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:55,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Load up the stuff.
Move it.

214
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,167  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Over here.

215
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:26,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alan, l've done my part.
You get in there.

216
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:32,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've already destroyed him.
No need to kill him.

217
00:39:32,693 --> 00:39:35,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You think he'd let me live
if he was here with a gun?

218
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not a chance. ln this world,
the man who holds the gun wins.

219
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:43,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The real fact is he's in my way,
and he's got to die.

220
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:46,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He doesn't want big bucks
but l sure as hell do.

221
00:39:46,774 --> 00:39:50,505  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His low prices are killing
my market, l'm losing out.

222
00:39:51,412 --> 00:39:55,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So don't blame me. lt's what you've
got, not how you made it. All right?

223
00:40:07,895 --> 00:40:09,453  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
OK, load her up.

224
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:20,106  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everything else
depends on you now, Alan.

225
00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:28,211  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you can't do it when
he gets here, l can.

226
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:34,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know where
your bread's buttered.

227
00:40:40,094 --> 00:40:41,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go.

228
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:35,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alan, you stinking traitor.
Fuck you. You goddamn little shit.

229
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:39,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lonny, drop that gun.
Drop it!

230
00:42:49,323 --> 00:42:52,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And the rest of you,
drop them!

231
00:42:53,928 --> 00:42:55,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Drop your guns!

232
00:43:01,202 --> 00:43:04,968  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alan, l see this is
where l check out.

233
00:43:16,951 --> 00:43:19,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mr. Hui, what're your
weapons doing down there?

234
00:43:20,387 --> 00:43:23,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe surrendering?
or scared to death?

235
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:28,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bastard!
-Stop! Stop it, idiot, cool it.

236
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:31,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Put your effing guns down.
ldiots!

237
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:40,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Johnny, if l die-- that's fine,

238
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:42,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but surely you don't
have to kill all my boys?

239
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:47,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Johnny, he's right.
Why waste any bullets on shit?

240
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:51,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's up to you this time. Whatever
you want, that choice is yours.

241
00:43:53,287 --> 00:43:56,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Johnny, you're a smart guy.

242
00:43:57,258 --> 00:44:00,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'd like to talk to
Alan alone. Yes or no?

243
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:02,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mr. Hui, you'll need
more than words.

244
00:44:13,808 --> 00:44:17,244  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, everything changes.

245
00:44:20,147 --> 00:44:23,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt isn't always pleasant either,
and there isn't always a choice.

246
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:33,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like Hawaii. l didn't go because
l knew this day would come.

247
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:39,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Someone had to sell me out to him.
But l read you all wrong.

248
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
An error of judgment.
One of those things.

249
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:45,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please, release the guys.

250
00:44:46,006 --> 00:44:50,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look, l'm happy to die,

251
00:44:50,811 --> 00:44:52,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but not by the hands of that
bunch of rotten goatshit.

252
00:44:52,847 --> 00:44:56,248  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l want you to shoot me, Alan.
-Shoot you?

253
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:57,611  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shoot me.

254
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:05,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go on, do it.
Finish the job.

255
00:45:05,793 --> 00:45:08,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's no way out, either
you kill me or l kill you.

256
00:45:13,234 --> 00:45:17,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mr. Hui!
-Don't move! Hold it!

257
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:27,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Boss! Mr. Hui!

258
00:46:45,426 --> 00:46:47,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Kill him! Kill that guy!

259
00:47:14,588 --> 00:47:17,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Forget it, you get out.
-Bullshit, l'll kill him.

260
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:21,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt isn't worth it.
Cool, dude.

261
00:47:24,965 --> 00:47:26,227  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go for it.
-Yep.

262
00:52:31,538 --> 00:52:32,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who is he?

263
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:37,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We both know him,
how come he didn't shoot me?

264
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:41,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yuen, l told you already to lay off
the case. -Tell me who he is!

265
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:49,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A triad. -Triad? l wish he were,
somehow l don't think he is.

266
00:52:51,224 --> 00:52:56,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf l see him, he's a dead duck.
Just thought l'd tell you.

267
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sergeant Yuen, get back here!

268
00:53:03,003 --> 00:53:07,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't have to tell you the
reasons. Remember that.

269
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:11,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt'd be a smart move, nonetheless.
lf l'd had slugs the other night,

270
00:53:11,645 --> 00:53:13,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'd have killed a cop.

271
00:53:13,647 --> 00:53:15,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aren't we self-righteous.

272
00:53:16,817 --> 00:53:20,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As a matter of fact,
back at the teahouse, you did.

273
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:24,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, it's not the
first time. Accidents happen.

274
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:28,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please, Tequila. Sacrifices.
On duty,

275
00:53:28,495 --> 00:53:31,896  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a police officer bravely sacrifices
his life! -Sacrifices?

276
00:53:32,065 --> 00:53:33,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ls that what you call it?

277
00:53:35,035 --> 00:53:38,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'd better tell us who are
the cops and who are the thieves,

278
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:40,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and why you want us
to kill each other?

279
00:53:41,475 --> 00:53:45,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Better buckle down to the job
and forget all the questions.

280
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:50,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me say this, you're under my
command, not the other way around.

281
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You want to ask why?

282
00:53:51,985 --> 00:53:54,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's a hundred questions
you ain't gonna get answered.

283
00:53:55,088 --> 00:53:57,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like why do cops need search
warrants and not thieves?

284
00:53:58,992 --> 00:54:02,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why do cops have to write reports
when they use a gun and robbers don't?

285
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:06,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why are known murderers considered
innocent until proven guilty,

286
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:09,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and why does the burden of proof
lie on us, not on them?

287
00:54:10,537 --> 00:54:14,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why? -lf l knew the answer to
that, l'd be the superintendent.

288
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:18,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right?
What l say is this.

289
00:54:18,745 --> 00:54:21,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l lost a good friend back there when
Ah-Lung checked out in the teashop.

290
00:54:21,815 --> 00:54:23,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't give a shit what
happens to me, all right,

291
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:27,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but l'll get that human garbage
and burn him.

292
00:54:28,488 --> 00:54:32,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
God help anybody who tries
to stop me. -Sergeant!

293
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:42,693  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you step out of line again,
you'll be out of a job.

294
00:54:42,869 --> 00:54:47,568  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt'll be one more problem.
-l'm shaking.

295
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:52,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's what being
a cop is all about.

296
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:58,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can't beat the system even if you're
right. Don't fit, don't play.

297
00:54:58,185 --> 00:55:02,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l thought there would be justice.
Every time a bastard got off,

298
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:05,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l lost more faith. But at the
end of the day, l got over it.

299
00:55:05,992 --> 00:55:08,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And if you couldn't crack a case?
-Suicide.

300
00:55:08,662 --> 00:55:10,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
C'mon. Worse than that.
-Sometimes, yes.

301
00:55:10,764 --> 00:55:13,892  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What a shitty likeness!
lt took me two days to see it.

302
00:55:14,067 --> 00:55:16,763  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ln fact l know him,
he lives at Clearwater Bay.

303
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:20,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Foxy, what a winner, right?
-lt could have been easier.

304
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:29,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So? -Pang says he's a triad. Beware,
he's an undercover. Be very careful.

305
00:55:30,484 --> 00:55:33,146  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you speak to him, tell him
there's no need

306
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to kill or be killed to crack
a case. There are better ways.

307
00:55:43,163 --> 00:55:49,466  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You got a guy called Vodka?
-Vodka? Tequila. A heavy-duty cop.

308
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:55,607  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't give a shit who he is. Tell him
to back off. l don't want no hassles.

309
00:55:55,775 --> 00:55:59,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That man will wreck everything. You
want another funeral in the department?

310
00:55:59,846 --> 00:56:02,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Point taken, l'll stop him.

311
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,215  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And get that export license,
Johnny doesn't do that shipment,

312
00:56:07,387 --> 00:56:09,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't find out where
his depot is located.

313
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:13,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give me a day, OK?
Customs are a snap.

314
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Be cool. You'll get what you want.
-What about my Swiss bank account?

315
00:56:17,397 --> 00:56:20,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Buttoned up.
-And what about the house in Guam?

316
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:23,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does it have a walled garden?
-l'm not playing this game, Tony.

317
00:56:23,937 --> 00:56:26,667  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you don't want to do this job,
you're free to quit.

318
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And live where?
Just stay real.

319
00:56:34,214 --> 00:56:35,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's up, don't trust me?

320
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:39,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know, l always deliver
the goods, Superintendent.

321
00:56:41,855 --> 00:56:44,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's your birthday.
You forgot?

322
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,022  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A present.

323
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l had forgotten.

324
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:56,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So busy being a gangster,
l don't know which me is real.

325
00:56:57,971 --> 00:57:00,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And you're the only guy
that remembered it anyhow.

326
00:57:02,909 --> 00:57:04,467  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't forget that.

327
00:57:55,128 --> 00:57:58,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it? You still upset,
looking for a little revenge?

328
00:58:12,646 --> 00:58:14,978  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What should l call you?

329
00:58:15,915 --> 00:58:17,542  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not really a criminal.

330
00:58:18,985 --> 00:58:21,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But not exactly a cop.
What's your rank? Sergeant?

331
00:58:22,355 --> 00:58:24,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lnspector? Joker?

332
00:58:25,191 --> 00:58:28,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Should l salute you?
-lf you like.

333
00:58:29,262 --> 00:58:34,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To you l'm a thief, to my mother
a son, to the triads l'm a hero.

334
00:58:37,437 --> 00:58:40,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Could we ever be friends?
-You've got the gun.

335
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:44,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can tell me to go out
and milk a cow and l'll do it.

336
00:58:44,644 --> 00:58:47,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm sorry, l don't like milk.

337
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's with all
these paper cranes?

338
00:58:56,189 --> 00:58:57,588  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You bored?

339
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe you feel lonely here?

340
00:59:05,098 --> 00:59:06,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know, l've always
hated making cranes.

341
00:59:09,302 --> 00:59:11,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l make one each time
l kill somebody.

342
00:59:13,206 --> 00:59:16,573  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How about it, shall l make you one?
-No thanks.

343
00:59:21,081 --> 00:59:23,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And if you get killed,
who'll make yours?

344
00:59:26,486 --> 00:59:28,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why don't you and l work together?

345
00:59:28,888 --> 00:59:30,480  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Make a paper vulture
for Johnny Wong?

346
00:59:31,658 --> 00:59:36,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Because l don't have time. You
make it for him, l've got to go.

347
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:42,501  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l hate in-house funerals.

348
00:59:44,971 --> 00:59:46,768  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l write all the music each time.

349
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:50,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A cop dies and l have
to play a tune for him.

350
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:53,570  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l really don't want
to do that for you.

351
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:31,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out!
Johnny Wong's here.

352
01:01:32,745 --> 01:01:35,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How do we keep in touch?
-l'll send you a crane.

353
01:01:36,149 --> 01:01:38,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Be good, you're on your own.

354
01:01:42,055 --> 01:01:45,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You two-faced bastard,
damn you, you called the cops.

355
01:01:45,658 --> 01:01:47,489  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Check the place.

356
01:01:49,395 --> 01:01:51,488  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alan, l've been after this
bastard for a long time.

357
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:57,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know, you're my guy now,
l'll look after you.

358
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,305  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hospital!
-Right.

359
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:11,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'll get round-the-clock
guards, so don't worry.

360
01:02:12,085 --> 01:02:16,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't need it, l'll be all right.
-Don't be silly, you do need it.

361
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:13,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please nurse,
over here a minute.

362
01:03:17,784 --> 01:03:19,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't want this patient's
records left here.

363
01:03:20,253 --> 01:03:22,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nobody must know he's
in this room, understand?

364
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:25,652  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We know the Fox double-crossed you.

365
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He told Hui's leftovers
where you were hanging out.

366
01:03:29,128 --> 01:03:32,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He'll pay for that.
-Forget about it, l'll handle it.

367
01:03:32,398 --> 01:03:34,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe you should get
better first. l'll do it.

368
01:03:58,124 --> 01:04:01,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ls the Fox really a traitor?
-The Fox has two masters.

369
01:04:02,695 --> 01:04:05,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He works for the cops and us.
He told me about Hui's warehouse.

370
01:04:10,236 --> 01:04:11,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bastard!

371
01:04:15,608 --> 01:04:17,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He can tell about yours as well.

372
01:04:20,146 --> 01:04:22,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt wasn't smart to tell him.

373
01:04:23,082 --> 01:04:25,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'll kill him,
l'll kill that little dickhead.

374
01:04:30,957 --> 01:04:32,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me take care of him.

375
01:05:05,558 --> 01:05:07,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What have you told
our friends the cops?

376
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:13,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've told them nothing.
This is pointless.

377
01:05:18,938 --> 01:05:21,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Little fucker, playing dumb!

378
01:05:24,343 --> 01:05:26,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you didn't rat on us, how
come the cops knew about the raid?

379
01:05:31,551 --> 01:05:33,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l wonder about that.

380
01:05:34,087 --> 01:05:38,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's more rats in this gang
than members. You know what?

381
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mr. Woo, he's a true friend.

382
01:05:49,702 --> 01:05:52,136  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right or wrong,
it doesn't matter.

383
01:05:52,305 --> 01:05:54,102  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He and l are both in
serious danger right now.

384
01:05:54,907 --> 01:05:57,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ln my position,
what would you do?

385
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf he really was my friend,
l wouldn't hesitate,

386
01:06:00,847 --> 01:06:03,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
whether he was right or wrong.

387
01:06:03,282 --> 01:06:06,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Even if l was still a cop,
yes, l'd still help him.

388
01:06:07,753 --> 01:06:11,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Such character. -Not me old buddy,
it's the guy up there.

389
01:06:16,529 --> 01:06:20,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Foxy, Foxy, what happened to you?

390
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:24,627  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Foxy, what is it? -Johnny Wong's
arsenal, it's over at...

391
01:06:24,804 --> 01:06:30,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where is it?
-Maple, Maple Hospital.

392
01:06:32,712 --> 01:06:36,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mr. Woo, call my girlfriend for me,
have her meet me at the hospital.

393
01:07:12,652 --> 01:07:17,988  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who brought him in?
-lt's all right nurse, l did.

394
01:07:18,324 --> 01:07:20,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lnspector Yuen, ClD, l'll register
him formally later. l'm responsible.

395
01:07:41,614 --> 01:07:42,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hold it right there.

396
01:07:46,185 --> 01:07:47,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm sorry.

397
01:07:53,226 --> 01:07:56,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nurse, blood pressure.
-lt's low, eighty over fifty.

398
01:07:56,696 --> 01:07:58,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And his pupils?

399
01:08:00,766 --> 01:08:03,929  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Somewhat dilated.
-Nurse, give him oxygen.

400
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:08,102  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Boss, that cop took Foxy
to Maple Hospital, he's alive.

401
01:08:10,176 --> 01:08:14,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So what's going on?
-lt's about Foxy.

402
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:16,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Somehow he's still alive.
-l'll bet he ratted on us.

403
01:08:17,883 --> 01:08:20,249  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me take care of it.
-You?

404
01:08:20,386 --> 01:08:23,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l won't miss this time.
-Kill that cop too.

405
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:36,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm not convinced.

406
01:08:37,737 --> 01:08:40,137  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Send extra guys with him,
just in case.

407
01:08:43,409 --> 01:08:46,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The guy was my informer,
so tell me how he's doing.

408
01:08:46,846 --> 01:08:49,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Luckily, he had a lighter in his
breast pocket, or he'd be dead.

409
01:08:49,682 --> 01:08:51,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When can he talk?
-Not yet, he needs rest.

410
01:09:40,099 --> 01:09:43,626  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you all right?
-Cig...

411
01:09:43,803 --> 01:09:46,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What?
-Ciga...

412
01:09:46,806 --> 01:09:50,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt'll blow up your oxygen.

413
01:09:50,443 --> 01:09:52,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Turn it off then, turn it off.

414
01:09:54,046 --> 01:09:56,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're half dead,
give yourself a break.

415
01:09:56,716 --> 01:09:59,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm all dead.

416
01:10:00,252 --> 01:10:02,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But before l go, l want
to prove l was the best.

417
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've already proven it.

418
01:10:11,664 --> 01:10:12,858  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Someone guessed?

419
01:10:16,168 --> 01:10:19,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Johnny's gun cache is in the
basement of the goddamn hospital.

420
01:10:20,539 --> 01:10:22,370  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Am l smart or what?

421
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,142  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf l crack this case,
10%% in it for you.

422
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:32,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l won't live to see it.

423
01:10:39,325 --> 01:10:41,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's up to you.
The show's all yours.

424
01:10:43,929 --> 01:10:48,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're full of it,
give me that, come on.

425
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:56,937  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now rest. -Who's smoking?
Don't you know it's dangerous?

426
01:10:57,109 --> 01:11:01,569  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's why l put it out. -Don't
do it again. Time for medication.

427
01:11:03,516 --> 01:11:08,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please, no injections, buddy.
They might try to kill me.

428
01:11:08,454 --> 01:11:11,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Relax, that's the reason
l'm here with you.

429
01:11:11,924 --> 01:11:13,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The gentleman outside
sent this for you.

430
01:11:25,838 --> 01:11:28,864  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are you taking me?
-Somewhere safe.

431
01:11:33,012 --> 01:11:35,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One of my men's
guarding a witness.

432
01:11:35,748 --> 01:11:38,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Which room is he in?
-Room 301.

433
01:12:35,774 --> 01:12:38,334  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
White roses again.
Can't you be more original?

434
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:39,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's wrong with them?

435
01:12:41,714 --> 01:12:45,616  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
From an undercover cop? -That's
irrelevant, it's just my taste.

436
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roses are so obvious,
anyone would suspect them.

437
01:12:51,857 --> 01:12:54,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where's Foxy?
-l put him there.

438
01:12:54,426 --> 01:12:57,327  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And where's Johnny's arsenal?
-l'm not sure l can say.

439
01:13:00,266 --> 01:13:01,733  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No time to waste.

440
01:13:03,602 --> 01:13:05,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't like being bullied.

441
01:13:12,778 --> 01:13:14,302  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me where the arsenal is.

442
01:13:22,021 --> 01:13:24,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l went through a lot
of hassle to let Foxy escape.

443
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:28,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Things ain't been easy for me. When
l'm triad, the cops try to kill me.

444
01:13:29,728 --> 01:13:32,060  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And when l'm a cop,
everyone tries to kill me.

445
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:34,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm one scared guy.

446
01:13:35,634 --> 01:13:37,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l just want to get this clear,
and close the case.

447
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:42,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why are you giving me this shit?
-You're not being realistic.

448
01:13:50,883 --> 01:13:53,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
OK, you bust these
bastards, and then what?

449
01:13:54,753 --> 01:13:57,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The government gives you money
and a new passport.

450
01:13:57,356 --> 01:13:59,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you going
to do with your life?

451
01:13:59,892 --> 01:14:02,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where do you think you're going?
You've got to have an operation.

452
01:14:11,303 --> 01:14:15,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After all you've done for them, the
police will never thank you, Tony.

453
01:14:22,348 --> 01:14:26,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've known that all along.
-So, then wise up. Come on.

454
01:15:06,525 --> 01:15:10,052  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's happened?
-Nothing, just move on.

455
01:15:17,536 --> 01:15:19,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch out for strangers, OK?
-OK.

456
01:15:25,811 --> 01:15:27,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch out.

457
01:15:33,752 --> 01:15:36,812  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We should go on up.
l've got a rendezvous to keep.

458
01:16:08,287 --> 01:16:11,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tequila!
-Been here long? Let's go inside.

459
01:16:12,825 --> 01:16:17,524  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Any news? -Big steel reinforcements
were used in the morgue.

460
01:16:17,696 --> 01:16:19,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They spent almost
four months building it.

461
01:16:23,435 --> 01:16:25,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's what Foxy said
before he died. -He's dead?

462
01:16:28,607 --> 01:16:29,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We were a little late.

463
01:16:32,578 --> 01:16:36,446  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l forgot to introduce you.
My girlfriend, Theresa.

464
01:16:37,049 --> 01:16:39,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aren't you the one who
sent her all the flowers?

465
01:16:43,522 --> 01:16:45,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your flowers are beautiful.
-Thanks.

466
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:48,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l just picked them at random.

467
01:16:51,063 --> 01:16:53,896  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My girlfriend hates white roses.
-l hate people who don't send them.

468
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,227  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lover's quarrel?
-Little one.

469
01:16:58,403 --> 01:17:01,497  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everyone disagrees once in a while.
We'll be all right!

470
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:05,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Call Mr. Pang at once. Ask him
to come over. Wait for me here.

471
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:08,811  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And when you get my signal,
get the patients out.

472
01:17:08,981 --> 01:17:11,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What'll the signal be?
-Send her flowers!

473
01:17:11,884 --> 01:17:16,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'll send me flowers?
-He got that from me.

474
01:17:18,223 --> 01:17:20,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l just picked it up.
Guess l should say thank you.

475
01:17:24,263 --> 01:17:25,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'll get my flowers
in half an hour.

476
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're so smart,
you'll know what to do.

477
01:17:30,636 --> 01:17:31,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can we go now?

478
01:17:41,947 --> 01:17:47,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
B2. -Mr. Pang, l'm at Maple Hospital,
can you get here straight away?

479
01:17:50,355 --> 01:17:54,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you new here? What's your name?
-Geoff Yuen.

480
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:57,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'd like to see a specialist.
-What's the problem?

481
01:17:58,163 --> 01:17:59,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fever, l think.

482
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:04,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who have you got there then?
Let's take a look.

483
01:18:04,603 --> 01:18:07,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't want to,
he's a mess, eyes hanging out,

484
01:18:07,472 --> 01:18:09,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
guts all around his neck,
naughty bits missing.

485
01:18:25,824 --> 01:18:30,488  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wasn't my timing perfect?
-Theirs was better.

486
01:18:40,472 --> 01:18:42,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Theresa Chang, your turn!

487
01:18:43,075 --> 01:18:45,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's so many patients.
Let them go first.

488
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:49,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm all right.
l don't need a doctor!

489
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:57,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Miss, if you're ill you must see
a doctor. -l said l didn't want to!

490
01:18:58,056 --> 01:18:59,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stay calm.
Remember we're cops.

491
01:19:09,268 --> 01:19:13,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are Tony and Tequila?
-They're in the morgue.

492
01:19:26,518 --> 01:19:31,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
See this? These are
all empty. J 1 2 3 4.

493
01:20:02,421 --> 01:20:05,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you crazy?
How do you suggest we get out?

494
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:07,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're not leaving yet.

495
01:20:10,195 --> 01:20:13,062  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How's Tony doing?
ls his cover blown yet?

496
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:16,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The whole operation
depends entirely on him.

497
01:20:16,902 --> 01:20:20,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l hope that mortuary's got good
''Feng Shui.'' May God keep him safe.

498
01:20:21,707 --> 01:20:25,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And Tequila's there!
Why don't you care about him?

499
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:26,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's in danger too!

500
01:20:28,213 --> 01:20:31,546  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's favoritism!
You're always on his case!

501
01:20:31,717 --> 01:20:33,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's obvious you don't
understand him one bit!

502
01:20:37,589 --> 01:20:39,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l didn't realize you still cared.

503
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:51,627  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's the arrangement?
-l wait for his signal.

504
01:20:51,803 --> 01:20:54,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When l receive some roses,
we evacuate the patients.

505
01:21:29,374 --> 01:21:32,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Great idea, throw a tantrum.
Always opens doors.

506
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:36,640  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You do it, go on!

507
01:21:39,985 --> 01:21:43,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why are you such a dickhead?

508
01:21:43,688 --> 01:21:45,781  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This isn't even your case.

509
01:21:48,393 --> 01:21:49,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't agree.

510
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:56,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ln my opinion, at this stage
it has everything to do with me.

511
01:21:56,701 --> 01:22:00,660  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf every cop was as self-important
as you, Hong Kong would be dead.

512
01:22:03,675 --> 01:22:07,543  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why not stop trying to pin the blame.
Let me open the door.

513
01:23:31,263 --> 01:23:34,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Which year did you graduate?
Did you graduate?

514
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:37,398  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Perhaps.

515
01:23:38,937 --> 01:23:42,100  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good. lt would be
interesting to find out

516
01:23:42,274 --> 01:23:44,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
who trained you to be
this jackass you've become.

517
01:23:48,313 --> 01:23:49,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pang said you don't waste slugs.

518
01:23:51,183 --> 01:23:52,172  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't waste them.

519
01:25:42,761 --> 01:25:44,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What the hell!

520
01:27:44,516 --> 01:27:47,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We killed Foxy, but Alan
and that cop disappeared.

521
01:27:47,285 --> 01:27:49,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l want to get all units
here right away.

522
01:27:49,254 --> 01:27:52,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mr. Pang, it's time
to get everyone out.

523
01:27:52,524 --> 01:27:54,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've just found
the rose here in my pocket.

524
01:27:55,393 --> 01:27:56,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get the team.

525
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're in the basement.
Sorry Mr. Wong, it's all our fault.

526
01:29:11,102 --> 01:29:13,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know what l hate?
Two groups of people:

527
01:29:14,739 --> 01:29:18,266  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
fucking cops and creeps
who betray their old bosses.

528
01:29:21,412 --> 01:29:22,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You bastard.

529
01:29:23,915 --> 01:29:26,907  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf your information is incorrect,
then it'll cause a lot of panic

530
01:29:27,085 --> 01:29:29,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and many patients could get hurt
in the rush. Who's responsible?

531
01:29:29,787 --> 01:29:32,847  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The police. -You're responsible
for law and order, you hunt people.

532
01:29:33,024 --> 01:29:35,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But l'm a doctor, l heal them.

533
01:29:35,527 --> 01:29:38,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l can't risk their lives just
because of some wild rumor.

534
01:29:50,842 --> 01:29:52,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's going on?

535
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
False alarm!
Everyone back to their rooms!

536
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:01,645  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By law you're obliged to evacuate
everyone if there's a fire alarm.

537
01:30:17,769 --> 01:30:19,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You told me it was safe.

538
01:30:21,339 --> 01:30:23,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Turn the coolant on.
-Yes.

539
01:31:06,317 --> 01:31:11,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's no room for failure now.
The innocent must die.

540
01:31:11,356 --> 01:31:14,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Time is not on our side.
lnsist they move the patients.

541
01:31:14,559 --> 01:31:15,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That shit cop.

542
01:31:17,128 --> 01:31:19,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've got all the aces.
l'll play every last one.

543
01:31:19,497 --> 01:31:21,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nobody challenges Johnny.
They won't succeed.

544
01:31:21,599 --> 01:31:23,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's happening?
-l'm a cop. Get everyone out.

545
01:31:27,338 --> 01:31:28,965  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fast as you can.
lt's only a fire drill.

546
01:31:29,107 --> 01:31:34,101  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Relax. Keep calm and
keep moving.

547
01:31:35,046 --> 01:31:39,380  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm in charge, everyone! This is a
false alarm. Go back to your beds.

548
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:42,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you crazy?
l'll arrest you if you keep on.

549
01:31:42,487 --> 01:31:44,387  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And l'll sue you for abuse of power.

550
01:31:44,555 --> 01:31:46,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There are more than
300 lives at stake.

551
01:31:46,791 --> 01:31:51,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you obstruct me again,
l'll castrate you.

552
01:31:51,329 --> 01:31:53,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take it easy, be careful.

553
01:31:59,837 --> 01:32:03,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who's taking the babies out of here?
-There's only us, what can we do?

554
01:32:03,808 --> 01:32:05,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bring help, and take her.

555
01:32:14,385 --> 01:32:16,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, all the guys have come.

556
01:32:25,029 --> 01:32:28,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You must leave immediately.
-Continue.

557
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,327  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The cops are making it worse.

558
01:32:35,073 --> 01:32:36,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cut the mains, stop them.
-Right.

559
01:32:48,019 --> 01:32:49,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get these babies out.

560
01:32:53,925 --> 01:32:55,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mr. Pang, they're firing at us.
-l hear you.

561
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,135  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're causing wholesale slaughter.
-Just don't kill the patients.

562
01:33:06,504 --> 01:33:08,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doctor, doctor!

563
01:33:16,481 --> 01:33:19,746  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nobody move, or you're all dead.
Get back up. Upstairs.

564
01:33:19,951 --> 01:33:23,045  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out of here, are you deaf?

565
01:33:25,423 --> 01:33:27,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's all right, ClD.
-Come back up.

566
01:33:33,264 --> 01:33:34,458  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Drop your gun! Police!

567
01:33:58,356 --> 01:33:59,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The cops have got us surrounded.

568
01:34:09,267 --> 01:34:11,929  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They've pushed me too far.
Take the patients hostage.

569
01:34:13,738 --> 01:34:17,139  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A cop's just a human being
with a gun, he's not immortal.

570
01:34:17,542 --> 01:34:22,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They've got guns, so have we.
They just have .38s.

571
01:34:47,605 --> 01:34:51,336  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get down, on the floor.
Down, l said, asshole.

572
01:35:04,589 --> 01:35:07,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out! You get out and leave
the babies here. Go.

573
01:35:07,892 --> 01:35:11,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Didn't you hear? Get out.
Are you deaf?

574
01:35:14,098 --> 01:35:16,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'd like you to shut up.
You're scaring the babies to death.

575
01:35:24,609 --> 01:35:26,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There, there.
lt's all right now.

576
01:35:49,433 --> 01:35:52,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The bastard's a nut.
Now he wants to blow us up.

577
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:56,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How will you send the flowers?
-l did it 20 minutes ago.

578
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:59,107  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Telepathy?
-Guy goes through hell for a girl,

579
01:35:59,277 --> 01:36:00,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but she doesn't realize it.

580
01:36:09,287 --> 01:36:10,982  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You believe you can get
away from me?

581
01:36:15,092 --> 01:36:19,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alan, l admired the hell
out of you.

582
01:36:19,397 --> 01:36:23,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l actually thought you were
my friend, but you betrayed me.

583
01:36:23,401 --> 01:36:27,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And that makes me angry.
-Well, it won't get any better.

584
01:36:27,238 --> 01:36:30,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'll kill you whenever l can.
l've been after you for ages.

585
01:36:30,341 --> 01:36:33,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why did you choose a hospital?
You like killing innocent people?

586
01:36:33,444 --> 01:36:37,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l use them. l've got more hostages
than you've had hot dinners.

587
01:36:37,915 --> 01:36:40,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l've got a serious
arms cache down there.

588
01:36:40,651 --> 01:36:44,018  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf you make me cross, boy, l'll
detonate it, up it will go. -Try it.

589
01:36:44,188 --> 01:36:45,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l will, l can't wait to do it.

590
01:36:46,357 --> 01:36:50,054  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The next arsenal l have
will be in a police station.

591
01:36:51,162 --> 01:36:52,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That should be fun.

592
01:36:57,868 --> 01:37:00,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hundreds of patients and staff
are being held prisoner here.

593
01:37:00,838 --> 01:37:02,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So far the police have
not been able to...

594
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:11,444  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't do it.
-Shut up, bitch.

595
01:37:34,105 --> 01:37:36,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Unit number 3, tell them
to stop filming, no pictures.

596
01:37:40,878 --> 01:37:45,338  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The walls are like ice,
must be the morgue in there.

597
01:37:45,516 --> 01:37:47,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good, that's handy.

598
01:37:49,553 --> 01:37:51,214  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lf we die, they can
just chuck us in.

599
01:37:54,959 --> 01:37:56,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's just the two of us here.

600
01:37:56,994 --> 01:37:59,929  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Up there are hundreds of people in
trouble, so drop the self-pity.

601
01:38:00,398 --> 01:38:03,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l started in this to help end crime.
But l end up killing the innocent.

602
01:38:07,204 --> 01:38:09,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l only wanted to be a regular cop.

603
01:38:10,608 --> 01:38:12,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When l started,
there was only one job:

604
01:38:13,778 --> 01:38:16,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
undercover, and triad brother.

605
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:18,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's all right, just keep calm.

606
01:38:19,383 --> 01:38:25,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't you have any dreams? -Yeah.
l want to move down to Antarctica.

607
01:38:25,723 --> 01:38:29,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's freezing there.
You enjoy the cold?

608
01:38:29,326 --> 01:38:32,659  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's got a lot going for it.
lt's always light.

609
01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:34,695  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'd like that,
after all this darkness.

610
01:38:40,204 --> 01:38:43,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dreams are supposed
to be attainable, like mine.

611
01:38:43,607 --> 01:38:46,303  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l always wanted to be
a musician but l became a cop.

612
01:38:49,914 --> 01:38:53,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Life should be about fun, come on.

613
01:39:33,724 --> 01:39:34,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't move.

614
01:39:43,934 --> 01:39:45,128  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The guy's a cop.

615

616
01:40:02,653 --> 01:40:05,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

619
01:40:13,564 --> 01:40:15,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's this about out of line?

620
01:40:50,901 --> 01:40:52,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

629
01:43:15,412 --> 01:43:18,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's put cotton balls in

630
01:43:51,382 --> 01:43:53,213  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

631
01:43:53,684 --> 01:43:55,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't want this
many kids, do you?

They're over there.
Be gentle with them.

641
01:45:03,854 --> 01:45:06,379  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

677
01:54:10,834 --> 01:54:12,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
X-rated action.

678
01:54:36,693 --> 01:54:38,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Baby...

684
01:56:48,324 --> 01:56:52,055  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

688
01:57:55,291 --> 01:57:56,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why don't we all go up together?

689
01:58:01,064 --> 01:58:03,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're just shit!
You can't get me.

690
01:58:07,103 --> 01:58:10,971  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

693
01:58:47,076 --> 01:58:48,941  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bullshit.

694
01:59:30,687 --> 01:59:33,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get the injured out of here.

695
01:59:43,132 --> 01:59:44,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

696
02:00:36,753 --> 02:00:40,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You saved the day there,

697
02:01:22,098 --> 02:01:23,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tequila, any babies left?

Are you all right?
-Now, where's Tony?

701
02:01:38,948 --> 02:01:40,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One of ours is still up there.

702
02:02:05,408 --> 02:02:07,535  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're dead.
Stand up.

703
02:02:09,645 --> 02:02:11,135  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479

704
02:02:11,781 --> 02:02:14,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everybody. Obey him.
-Drop your guns, drop them.

705
02:02:40,743 --> 02:02:44,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The hard-boiled cop.
You made it.

706
02:02:45,781 --> 02:02:47,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Each side's lost some guys.

707
02:02:48,918 --> 02:02:50,783  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're about even so far.

708
02:02:51,721 --> 02:02:53,689  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But when l kill this one, l win.

709
02:02:56,158 --> 02:02:57,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do it.

710
02:02:58,961 --> 02:03:01,623  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go ahead, watch me

711
02:03:06,002 --> 02:03:07,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't shoot.

712
02:03:08,704 --> 02:03:10,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
lt's like you're impotent.

713
02:03:10,973 --> 02:03:14,704  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l thought you were a supercop. But
you're just a man, like the rest.

714
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:18,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Slap yourself.

715
02:03:25,488 --> 02:03:27,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now the other cheek,

716
02:03:34,597 --> 02:03:36,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Say you're impotent.

718
02:03:48,010 --> 02:03:49,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
On your knees.

719
02:03:56,185 --> 02:03:57,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Put your gun down.

720
02:03:58,821 --> 02:04:01,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How often do you get a chance
to fuck around like this?

721
02:04:02,892 --> 02:04:04,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
