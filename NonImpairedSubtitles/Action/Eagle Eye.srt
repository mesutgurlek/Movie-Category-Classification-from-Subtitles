1
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,080
Valhalla, this is Thor.
Valhalla, this is Thor.

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
<i>We have visual on
a possible high-value target.</i>

3
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,880
Thor, this is Valhalla.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,240
We're seeking positive ID
on target traveling in convoy

5
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,320
and we're pushing
more assets your way.

6
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,480
Contact Loki on secondary net.

7
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,400
Loki, this is Thor.

8
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,520
<i>Target is located at grid coordinates
two-four-Tango-Kilo-Bravo</i>

9
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,800
<i>one-two-four-five-six-seven-three-niner.</i>

10
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,520
<i>Confirm you have visual.</i>

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,960
Verifying target ID.

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
Electro-optic and
infrared sensors are online.

13
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,440
- Confirming target.
- SecDef is arriving now.

14
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,560
Mr. Secretary, this way, sir.

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,320
Attempting cell phone link
to moving target.

16
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,160
Stand by for data feed.

17
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,280
Stand by for audio.

18
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,520
Got it.

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,720
Now, don't tell me you spotted the beard
in the middle of a goddamn sandstorm.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,880
- Is it really him?
- We're confirming that now, sir.

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,000
Sir, audio is coming up now.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
- Verifying voice pattern match.
- What do we have here, Sergeant?

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
Four males. One of them is speaking
in a Rakhshani dialect,

24
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,000
consistent with our intel on al-Khoei.

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,200
Sir, it's just coming up.

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,680
"Thirty-seven percent" and "probable"
don't belong in the same sentence.

27
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm not taking this to the President.

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>CIA and NCTC concur it is the target,</i>

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,080
<i>based on reliable intel from the Brits.</i>

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
They're pulling off the highway.

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
Criteria is not met. Recommend abort.

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,080
We have an abort recommendation.

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,840
If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
every couple of years at best.

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,240
Sir, target is appearing
around the northeast corner.

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,960
We've got AK-47 s,
RPGs and Chaparral guided missiles.

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,760
This is a training camp, Mr. Secretary.

37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,040
- Wait. Wait. Print. 51%.
- 51%.

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,920
- Abort rec still holds.
- All other PID options exhausted.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,200
What do you suggest we do, sir?

40
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,560
Is that a weapons cache?

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,560
Sir, the placement of
the stones around the pit,

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,040
marker for the five pillars of Islam.
I think it's a funeral.

43
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,480
For Christ's sake.

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,480
Counsel, how many ways would this
violate the Geneva Convention?

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,400
<i>We can invoke hors de combat.</i>

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,400
There's no independent intel verifying
that this is, in fact, a funeral.

47
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,560
Signal's got the President
from Air Force One, sir.

48
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,960
Mr. President,

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,680
we have a 51% identity match
on Majid al-Khoei.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,160
<i>The bad news is, there's
some possibility he's at a funeral.</i>

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,800
You should also be aware
we have an abort recommendation.

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,360
But the Joint Chiefs are urging a go.

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,640
<i>All right, what's your recommendation?</i>

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,320
Sir, we measure success by
the least amount of collateral damage.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,200
At 51% probability, the risk is too high.

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,680
<i>And if it is al-Khoei and he walks,
I'm putting our people at risk.</i>

57
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,080
<i>You have a go.</i>

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,640
Thank you, Mr. President.

59
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,400
- We're weapons hot!
- We have weapons hot!

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,800
- Loki, you are cleared to engage.
- Repeat, weapons hot. PID.

61
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,160
We have handshake with the
MQ9 Reaper. Sending you images now.

62
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,520
- Loki, target coordinates received.
- Yes, sir. Switching to IR sensor.

63
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,960
Target is lased.

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,520
Master arm on.

65
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,040
Missiles away.

66
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,800
Ten seconds to impact.

67
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,960
You got to make a choice, fellas.

68
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,360
Who are you going to be? Boys or men?

69
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,080
- I'm out on this one.
- Why?

70
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,360
- 'Cause I'm broke.
- Come...

71
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,120
How do I know you don't have
something great under there?

72
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,560
Kwame just paired the board.
I'm floating on the river here.

73
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,680
Look at the table.

74
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,480
I don't know. I'm supposed to take my
girl out later. It's a lot of money.

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,640
Your girl out? Who's that?

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,160
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,200
You guys have been going out
for a while.

78
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,640
How long?

79
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,920
- Couple months.
- Couple months? Wow.

80
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,080
- That's big. You have sex with her yet?
- Kinda.

81
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,440
- What the hell is "kinda"?
- "Kinda"?

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,680
- Personal question.
- Okay, well, listen.

83
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,000
Let me ask you a question.
What are you going to do tonight?

84
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,040
Fish filet and a Coke?

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,680
Go to Blockbuster,
rent a little romantic comedy,

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,400
go back to Mom's house,
sit on the couch?

87
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,720
- How'd you know?
- Well, that's what you do.

88
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,480
You're a dependable person.
That's what you're going to do.

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,080
You know what you should do?

90
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,400
You need to lay down some real green
and treat your lady right.

91
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,200
You know, you need to take her
to a nice place.

92
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Red Lobster. Olive Garden.
Tablecloths. Soft music.

93
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,400
And then you skip
this Blockbuster thing.

94
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,280
Girls want to go out. Especially a girl
as cute as your girl, you know?

95
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
She wants to be seen.
That's why she dresses up.

96
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,920
So you take her to the movies.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
- A little popcorn-drink combo.
- True. True.

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,440
Elaine might want a hot dog and some
nachos, so you shell out for that, too.

99
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,880
And then before you know it,

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,120
she's cozying up
the way she never would've

101
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,280
at her mom's house, you know?

102
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,720
- Preach it. Preach it.
- Now all of a sudden, look.

103
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,080
Gino Romero's walking tall
with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson,

104
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
- all because he dared to dream tonight.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

105
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,280
And he became a man.
And that's the choice.

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
- Yes.
- And that's what's on the table.

107
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,200
This is the dream right here.

108
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,640
Are you a man?

109
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,880
- I'm with you.
- Okay, here we go.

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,120
- I'm with you. Twenty?
- Twenty.

111
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,680
Big boy game.

112
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,280
Call.

113
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
- Cowboys over aces, big Jer.
- Wow. Wow.

114
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,520
- Didn't see that coming, huh?
- Yeah, that's a tough one.

115
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,640
This is a tough one, too.
Four bullets, baby.

116
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Get out of here!
You baited me into that, Jer. Come on!

117
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,320
- That's the way it goes.
- So what happened to Red Lobster?

118
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,960
No, I guess it's Mama's house
for you tonight.

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,280
But look, I saved you 40 bucks.

120
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,640
And now Elaine won't have to shell out
for herpes medication.

121
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,040
Break's over, bitches.
Freitag missed his shift again.

122
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,200
- Someone's on collator duty.
- Great.

123
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,120
All right, well, gentlemen,

124
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,880
I'll give you a chance to win some of
this back tomorrow. Enjoy yourselves.

125
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,440
All right, man.

126
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,120
Hey there. Welcome to Copy Cabana.
How can I help you?

127
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,320
I couldn't get the machine
past the main menu.

128
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,960
- That machine there?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,960
Did you swipe your credit card
to the left, sir?

130
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,760
- Didn't do that.
- Well, that's your problem.

131
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,840
Why don't you try it again?

132
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,840
<i>Cell phone users, beware.</i>

133

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,120
Yes.

Jerry?

147
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,560
Mrs. Wierzbowski! I was just...
I thought you might have been sleeping.

148
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,000
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So... But I have...

149
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,840
I have some rent here.

150
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
- Here you go.
- Yeah, some is good. All is better.

151
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,840
Well, that's most of it. Here.

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,200
$1, $1, $1...

153
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,840
No, no, no. Look. Here's a five there.

154
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
- Five.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,960
Where is girl? I don't see her no more.

156
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,240
You know you're the only woman for me.

157
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,080
No, that's done. She got smart.

158
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
- Like the others.
- Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,480
Is woman friend? Answer.
Then see if she give you money for rent.

160
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,200
One second.

161
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,640
Hey, Mom.

162
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,480
What?

163
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,040
- Looks just like him.
- I'm not him.

164
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,560
Six months without a boo or a bah, huh?

165
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,200
So where were you this time?

167
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,760
Alaska. Singapore.
I got a job there.

168
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,640
I... I spoke to Stanford.

169
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,720
I pulled some strings.

170
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,520
They said they'd take you back.
Even though you took off...

171
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,760
Two years ago, Dad.

172
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,320
Jerry, you know, it wouldn't kill you
to ask for help once in a while.

173
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,680
You want to have
this conversation now?

174
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,800
- It's Stanford!
- You want to do this today.

175
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,880
You know how many people would kill...

176
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,080
- Today? You want to have this now?
- Fine.

177
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,240
You do whatever you want.
You always have.

178
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,680
You know, I keep thinking,
I'm going to walk in here one day

179
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,200
and I'm not going to feel
like a stranger in my own house.

180
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,880
I don't want your money.

181
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,720
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

182
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,960
<i>Smoking is not permitted on the train.
Chicago is next.</i>

183
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,640
Can't find the keys
and he's late as usual.

184
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,600
- I'm going to have to take you.
- He'll be here.

185
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,400
All right, wait five more minutes.

186
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,400
Help me out here.
We came home last night.

187
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,280
I put the leftovers down.
You turned on the TV. I went over,

188
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,840
said, "No TV, no TV, no TV."
Turned it off.

189
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,960
Came over here.

190
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,000
- Checked the messages.
- Knocked over the phone.

191
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,400
Right, knocked over the phone.
Put it back.

192
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,680
Put the leftovers in the fridge.

193
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,400
Let's go!

194
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,680
I put vitamins in your toiletry bag.
Don't forget to take...

195
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,400
- Two in the morning and two at night.
- That's right.

196
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,360
And your inhaler's
in the back of your bag.

197
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,520
- Sammy!
- Daddy!

198
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,120
Come here. You didn't think
I'd miss the big send-off, do you, huh?

199
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,440
Let's get you on this train.

200
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,080
- This must be your...
- Trumpet.

201
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,080
My God, this weighs, like, 200 pounds.
You carry this yourself?

202
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,840
- Mr. and Mrs. Holloman!
- Miss.

203
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,440
- You just made it.
- Right.

204
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,880
- Here, Sam.
- Thanks.

205
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,960
- Listen to me.
- I have one more here.

206
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,720
All these other kids, right? They're
going to call their moms, too, all right?

207
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,440
They're just going to lie about it.

208
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,320
All right, and eat junk food 'cause this is
your one chance, but brush your teeth.

209
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,480
Mom, you got to stop.
I'm going to miss you, too.

210
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,120
<i>Capitol Limited to D.C. is
departing now.</i>

211
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,280
Give me a hug.

212
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,320
<i>All aboard.</i>

213
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

214
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
- Shine bright, okay?
- Okay.

215
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,760
Rock the house, buddy.
You're going to be great. Okay?

216
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,120
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

217
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,720
- Bye!
- Have fun in D.C.!

218
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,400
- Bye, Mom!
- Your mom going to be okay?

219
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,840
It's unclear.

220
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,040
I'm so sorry. I got stuck in traffic,

221
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,160
- and I didn't even...
- Don't even say it.

222
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,680
All aboard!

223
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Yes. Five-nine-one-three.

224
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,680
It's here. It's here.

225
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,200
Okay, okay.

226
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,960
- Come on!
- Two seconds. Sorry.

227
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,480
No, wait.

228
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,640
- Hey, hang on a second.
- Sorry.

229
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,920
- You're dropping money.
- Sir, sir!

230
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,680
Big date, you know?
Fingers crossed, huh?

231
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,760
- Here you go. Have a good day!
- Thank you.

232
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,080
- Jerry!
- What?

233
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,920
- So many boxes.
- Boxes?

234
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,400
I had to open your room.
All day they come.

235
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,840
- Big boxes, small boxes.
- My boxes?

236
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,280
I don't know.
Whose boxes would they be?

237
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,600
- All right, okay.
- Look at them there. See in there?

238
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,000
- See, I put them all...
- Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,840
- Listen, I have something for you here.
- Yeah.

240
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,840
This is rent for this month
and next month, too, okay?

241
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,600
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

242
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,120
Hello?

243
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,720
<i>The FBI will arrive
at your apartment in 30 seconds.</i>

244
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,360
<i>You must flee the premises.</i>

245
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,600
Who... Who is this?

246
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,120
<i>You've been activated, Jerry.</i>

247
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,040
<i>- Who the hell is this?
- Your compliance is vital.</i>

248
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,080
How did you get this number?

249
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,960
<i>You now have 24 seconds.
Leave your residence.</i>

250
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,440
<i>Your destination, the Mathis train
station. We will guide you from there.</i>

251
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,480
What is this?

252
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
<i>The evidence in your
apartment is irrefutable.</i>

253
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,760
<i>- Listen.
- 17 seconds.</i>

254
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,800
I'm going to hang this phone up now.

255
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,040
<i>They'll seek your arrest
for conspiracy, treason...</i>

256
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
<i>- I'm hanging this phone up now!
- ... violating state and local law.</i>

257
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,960
<i>- You tell me how you got this number!
- Maximum penalty, death.</i>

258
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
No, none of this is mine!

259
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,160
FBI, FBI, FBI! Get down on the floor!

260
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
Get on the ground!

261
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,680
Down now! Get down!

262
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,000
- I didn't do anything!
- Get down!

263
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,120
- Listen!
- Don't move.

264
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,520
It's not mine! It's not mine!

265
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,480
This is obviously
some sort of mistake, right?

266
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,360
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing in this room, sir.

267
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
It's cold as hell outside.

268
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,600
- You draw?
- I what?

269
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,120
Do you draw? Do you sketch?
You have ink all over your fingers.

270
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,800
Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?

271
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,120
I mean,
this is all some kind of sick joke.

272
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,320
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Obviously.

273
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,320
Obviously you have
nothing to do with it, yeah.

274
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,880
Did you love your brother?

275
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,720
Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?

276
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,320
Was your brother patriotic,
would you say?

277
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,600
When's the last time you saw him?

278
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,440
- Christmas.
- This past Christmas?

279
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,760
- Three Christmases ago.
- Three years, huh?

280
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,320
Well, the phone records show that you
haven't even called him in over a year.

281
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,080
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

282
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,640
No MySpace or Facebook messages?

283
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,160
Yeah, so what are you trying to say?
We're not...

284
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,400
Are you asking if we're the type of twins

285
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,800
that wear the same shirt to the mall,
hold hands, and things like that? No.

286
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,800
- Sir, I don't even know your name.
- I'm sorry, that was rude of me.

287
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,040
I'm Tom Morgan,

288
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,400
the Supervising Agent assigned
to the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

289
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,000
You think I'm a terrorist?

290
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,200
No, you're a copy boy, aren't you?

291
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,800
- I'm a copy associate.
- Copy associate.

292
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,720
But your brother,

293
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,840
it says here he was a little more,
I guess you'd say, ambitious than you.

294
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,960
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21,

295
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,600
with an advanced degree in parallel
algorithms and quantum electronics.

296
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,800
I don't even know what the hell
that stuff means. Do you?

297
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,280
Cadet wing commander, valedictorian,
plum job in the Public Affairs...

298
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah, no, I know what he did, sir.

299
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,560
Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?

300
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,840
Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?

301
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,280
No, school just wasn't for me.

302
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,680
No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

303
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,640
More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?

304
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,680
I see you did a little backpacking.
Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.

305
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,040
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

306
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,160
Look, none of this has anything to do

307
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

308
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

309
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,600
I'd have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world.

310
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,040
So who deposited the 750?

311
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,320
The...
I don't know who deposited the 750!

312
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,640
God maybe? I thought it was a miracle,

313
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,840
I took the money. That was my mistake.
It was an accident.

314
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,560
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

315
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,520
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

316
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,440
Well, I'll be darned, Singapore.

317
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
Opened with a transfer from
a corporation called The Star of Orion,

318
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,520
- a dummy front for Hezbollah.
- This is all very interesting, sir.

319
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,480
- It has nothing to do with me.
- We find hardware in your apartment.

320
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,400
Latest military spec.

321
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,640
- Airplane manuals.
- I told you about this already.

322
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,320
And 1,200 pounds
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

323
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
I walked into my apartment...

324
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,120
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

325
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,520
I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,

326
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,760
and this shit's all over my apartment.

327
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,200
- It just showed up.
- It just showed up.

328
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,960
I see. I'm just curious
if your brother knew anything about it.

329
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,000
Of course, we haven't really established
how close you guys were yet, have we?

330
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,800
Well, we were pretty close this morning
when I buried his body in the ground.

331
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,360
Does that establish anything for you?
Somebody set me up.

332
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,720
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

333
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,240
- "Somebody."
- A woman called me on the phone.

334
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,400
She told me I was going to be arrested.

335
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,760
"A woman." Your mom? Who?

336
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,280
I don't know! If I knew, I would tell you!
I don't know!

337
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,560
Here's the thing, Jerry.

338
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,720
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

339
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,480
You read the paper.

340
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,520
Who do you think is winning?

341
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,240
Your Miranda rights or my right to keep
you in this room as long as I want to?

342
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,120
I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

343
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,320
I don't care who you work for.

344
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,680
'Cause no matter what you tell me,
you're in a shitload of trouble, son.

345
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,600
This is insane. I work for Copy Cabana.

346
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,600
Yeah, that's what you said.

347
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,240
Listen, I get one night out
in a decade, ladies,

348
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,280
I am not wasting it on Lemon Drops.

349
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
- Okay.
- Buck up. Let's go.

350
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, gosh.

351
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,720
I want updates. Catfights, booty calls,
somebody tell me they got lucky.

352
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,840
Hey, ladies. See that guy over there?
He'd like to buy you a round.

353
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,120
Hell, no.
He's got light beer written all over him.

354
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,280
- He's cute.
- Come on.

355
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,400
He's a suit. No.

356
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,680
You sure?

357
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,120
- Come on.
- Who is it?

358
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,640
The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.

359
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,680
- That's sweet.
- All right, don't drink those without me.

360
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,800
Hello?

361
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,520
Hello?

362
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,920
<i>There's a McDonald's across the street.
Look in the window.</i>

363
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,080
What is this?

364
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,680
<i>Would you risk your life for your son?</i>

365
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,800
<i>Rachel Holloman,
you've been activated.</i>

366
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,640
<i>- This isn't funny.
- Your compliance is vital.</i>

367
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
<i>- Who are you?
- We will derail his train,</i>

368
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,280
<i>unless you do what you're told.</i>

369
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,320
What is this?

370
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,160
<i>Don't go back inside the restaurant.</i>

371
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,640
<i>- What?
- There's a black Porsche Cayenne</i>

372
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,360
<i>parked at the northeast corner
of this block.</i>

373
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,520
<i>The keys are in the ignition.
Start walking.</i>

374
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
Oh, my God.

375
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,320
<i>911.
State the nature of your emergency.</i>

376
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,320
Yeah, some woman just called me.
I have... I have no idea who she is.

377
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,320
She was telling me that...

378
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,280
<i>Your phone is being monitored.
Disobey again and your son dies.</i>

379
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,720
Hey, Grant, I can't read this Shaw file.

380
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,720
- Grant!
- Excuse me.

381
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,880
Listen, my eyes aren't getting any better
and these screens are getting smaller.

382
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,400
Could you please find me
something I can read?

383
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,960
I can make the text bigger
on your screen.

384
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,480
No, no, no. I'm talking about paper.

385
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,920
Remember, like in the olden times?

386
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,440
- Paper. Okay.
- Yeah.

387
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,320
Agent Morgan. Zoe Perez,
Air Force Special Investigations.

388
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,720
Ethan Shaw, the twin,
he was one of ours.

389
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,400
Yeah.
OSI said they were sending a liaison.

390
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,160
Can you walk and talk
at the same time?

391
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
I'll do my best.

392
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,400
File says he died in a traffic accident.

393
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,160
Truck ran a light, corner of
Constitution and 10th, Northwest D.C.

394
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,440
So truck ran a light,
his brother gets 750 large

395
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
and enough hardware
to start his own Costco,

396
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,040
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof.

397
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,880
I mean, don't you find that
a little coincidental?

398
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,480
<i>What if it's a decoy? To distract us from
something 50 times bigger.</i>

399
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,560
- Time for your phone call.
- I thought I didn't get one.

400
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,440
Attorney General's office
changed their mind.

401
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,400
Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ

402
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,680
and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

403
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,320
Why not IT or cyber-warfare?

404
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,320
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

405
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,720
Or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the Copy Cabana?

406
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,560
No, I'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw

407
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,560
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong,

408
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,120
and the Air Force doesn't want
their dirty laundry flapping in the wind.

409
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,760
Think what you like, but I need to get in
that room and interrogate him myself.

410
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,840
No.

411
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,480
You don't have a choice. Look.

412
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,520
Now, neither of us know if either of
those brothers are guilty or innocent,

413
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,160
so on behalf of the Secretary
of the Air Force, I'm going in that room.

414
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,480
Well, on behalf of
all that fucking bomb equipment

415
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,480
in junior pinhead's apartment,
no, you're not.

416
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,760
<i>We told you to run.
We have planned your escape.</i>

417
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,680
How'd you get on this phone?
Who are you?

418
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,600
<i>Lay flat on the floor immediately.</i>

419
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,040
What the...
What the hell are you talking about?

420
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,160
<i>Four seconds, Jerry.</i>

421
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,360
<i>- No, this is bullshit. I don't...
- Get down now.</i>

422
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,720
<i>Two seconds.</i>

423
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,920
No!

424
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,080
- No! I didn't do this!
- Get down!

425
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,200
Shit.

426
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,800
<i>Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors.</i>

427
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,400
<i>... fourteen Americans dead
throughout Europe and the Middle East,</i>

428
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,200
<i>with terror groups insisting
this is just the beginning</i>

429
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,240
<i>of a campaign the West invited
when it allegedly rained bombs</i>

430
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,200
<i>on a religious ceremony
outside the small town of Abda,</i>

431
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,480
<i>near the border of Afghanistan.</i>

432
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,000
<i>Stay on the train for three more stations
and wait at the bottom of the platform.</i>

433
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,800
<i>You will receive...</i>

434
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,880
<i>Doors closing. Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors.</i>

435
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,560
- Help!
- Jimmy.

436
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,400
My baby. I need some help. Somebody.

437
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,000
<i>- What?
- You're not listening.</i>

438
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,760
<i>We told you to stay on the train.</i>

439
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,440
<i>- How are you doing this?
- Next stop is Wilson Station.</i>

440
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,120
<i>A black Porsche Cayenne will be
waiting at the northwest exit.</i>

441
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,640
<i>- Listen.
- Get in the passenger seat.</i>

442
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,160
Listen! No, I'm done.

443
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,240
<i>- Hello?
- The man in front of the exit door</i>

444
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,720
<i>in a black coat is a wanted terrorist.</i>

445
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,800
<i>- His name is Jerry Shaw.
- Who is this?</i>

446
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,440
- You Jerry Shaw?
- No, no, no.

447
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,440
<i>Wilson Station. Exit now.</i>

448
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,360
That's the guy!

449
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,080
I said, are you Jerry Shaw?
Hey! Come here!

450
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,520
Watch it!

451
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,560
- Drive the car! Drive the car!
- No!

452
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,160
- I did what you asked me to do!
- I'm not going anywhere...

453
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,720
- You tell... Stop!
...until you tell me my son's safe!

454
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,640
Who's your son?
I don't know what you're talking about!

455
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,640
- I'll kill you if you hurt my son!
- I almost died over this shit!

456
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,480
- Listen, lady, I don't know who...
- Tell me Sam is safe!

457
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,920
Who is... Will you stop hitting me?

458
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,480
Are you the woman
who called me on the phone?

459
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,800
- Did you call me on the phone?
- No. The woman.

460
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,320
- She called you, too?
- She called you, too?

461
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,560
<i>Drive.</i>

462
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,360
Get out! Now! Get out of the vehicle!

463
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,960
Stop!

464
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
- Why is this happening?
- Go, go, go, go, go!

465
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,080
Who are you and
why are people shooting at us?

466
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,480
Drive the car! Clutch!

467
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,920
<i>Accelerate. Turn right, 200 feet.
You have pursuers.</i>

468
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,720
<i>- Yeah, no shit! Who are you?
- No questions.</i>

469
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,120
<i>Turn right now.</i>

470
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,680
So you don't know anything about Sam?

471
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,600
What, you mean your son?
No, I know nothing.

472
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,680
Just like you don't know how to drive.

473
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,400
Use the clutch before you shift,
not while you shift!

474
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,440
I don't need driving lessons
from you, asshole!

475
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,360
What, you drive like this
and I'm the asshole?

476
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,880
<i>Turn left now.</i>

477
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,920
All units. Suspect in a Porsche
Cayenne heading west on Grand.

478
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,520
- All units respond, Code 3.
- There!

479
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,920
<i>Maintain a speed of 50 miles an hour.
Stay in the second lane from the right.</i>

480
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,320
<i>- The light's red!
- Accelerate now.</i>

481
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Get me a roadblock
at Granville and Sheridan.

482
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,720
Oh, shit.

483
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,320
The lights are all turning green.

484
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,040
Holy shit!

485
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,120
- Holy...
- Shit!

486
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,000
Get in close.

487
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,280
Go, go, go!

488
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,640
<i>- Shit!
- Brake. Brake now.</i>

489
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,640
Get in here!

490
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,240
<i>Accelerate to 60 miles per hour.</i>

491
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,360
Clutch. Clutch!

492
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,120
- Use the clutch!
- I'm clutching!

493
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,600
I'm watching, you're not clutching!

494
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
- Stop!
- I'm not stopping.

495
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,600
Slow down. Slow down, the light's red.

496
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,600
<i>Don't slow down.
Accelerate to 72 miles per hour.</i>

497
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,520
<i>- Slow down. It's a red light!
- You will make it through.</i>

498
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,040
- Stop!
- No way.

499
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,240
- Brake!
- I can't!

500
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,520
- Brake!
- Stop!

501
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,480
<i>Manual control's been restored.</i>

502
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,760
<i>Continue straight
until you reach Pier 15.</i>

503
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,920
<i>Enter the wrecking yard.
Proceed to the end of the dock.</i>

504
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
<i>We will eliminate all obstacles for you.</i>

505
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,680
Watch! Watch! Watch!

506
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,480
<i>- Stay your course.
- Turn!</i>

507
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,120
<i>- Turn!
- Turn right now.</i>

508
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,480
Holy...

509
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,600
Oh, God.

510
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh, my God!

511
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,280
- Grab the seat.
- I can't.

512
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,680
- Grab the seat! The seat!
- No, I can't!

513
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,560
No!

514
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,600
<i>The crane will release the car.
If you do not jump, you will drown.</i>

515
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,760
- We have to jump.
- No! No way.

516
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,560
We have to. When I say "go."

517
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,120
Ready?

518
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,440
Go! Jump!

519
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,880
I want both the divers in that water!

520
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,640
- Let's go! Move!
- Let's go, let's go!

521
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,880
Move, move, move!

522
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,720
- Yeah, I already called it in!
- Wait till it clears!

523
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,720
Thirty feet back, that's it!

524
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,240
Yeah, I know,
the Army sent a Black Hawk,

525
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,680
so I'll be there in a couple of hours.

526
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,560
What do you mean,
the car is not registered to anyone?

527
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,800
Check the VIN number again.

528
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,800
<i>Leave your message for Sam,
even though I know it's you, Mom.</i>

529
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,040
Sam? Baby, listen to me.

530
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,920
You need to call me
as soon as you get this message, okay?

531
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,160
Baby, please. I love you.

532
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,720
- What about the girl?
- What?

533
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,320
What about the girl?

534
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,360
Well, the Department of Transpo
tells me that there was

535
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,760
a seven-minute equipment failure
on their traffic cams.

536
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,480
- We didn't get a picture of her.
- Don't tell me that.

537
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,960
- That's what they're telling me!
- I need an ID on that girl.

538
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,680
Do you think they could derail a train?

539
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
They changed every traffic light
to get us here.

540
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,040
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone

541
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,240
who happened to be sitting next to me.
Never met the guy in my life.

542
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,160
You know, and then they broke me out
of maximum security custody

543
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,440
in a way I'm not even gonna describe
to you because it sounds crazy,

544
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,000
and then they lift us off the face of
the Earth and drop us into this shit pile?

545
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,240
She could probably derail a train.

546
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,960
She could probably turn a train
into a talking duck.

547
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,800
And what about these goddamn ghost
cranes that keep helping peewee out?

548
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,680
I mean, they don't just lift cars
up in the air all by themselves

549
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,240
like a giant pair of chopsticks.

550
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,200
I want to know how these things run,
how they're programmed.

551
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,680
What'd you say your name was?

552
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
- Rachel.
- I'm Jerry.

553
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,760
<i>- Hello?
- The barge will dock in 14 minutes.</i>

554
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,000
<i>Leave the boatyard with the female.
Take Highway 123 East.</i>

555
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,600
<i>Walk to mile marker 108.</i>

556
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,200
- What? Was it her?
- She called you "the female."

557
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,600
Have Mortuary Affairs freeze everything
belonging to Ethan Shaw.

558
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,880
- No personal effects to next of kin.
- You, Due Process!

559
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,680
- Bye.
- What do you have on Ethan Shaw?

560
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,360
I have a name. It's Agent Perez.

561
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,560
And I'll answer that question
when I get back from D.C.

562
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,920
- Wait a minute. What's in D.C.?
- Shaw's private quarters.

563
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,760
I need you to stay here.
I'm not losing my link to Ethan Shaw.

564
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,800
Maybe I haven't made this clear.

565
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,760
I don't work for you.
I work for the Air Force.

566
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,520
Keep your phone on,
I'll keep you updated.

567
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,640
If you're staring at me, it better be
because I'm the goddamn suspect.

568
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,280
Because if I don't get some good leads
soon, you're all gonna be demoted

569
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,560
into something that's gonna require
touching shit with your hands.

570
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,640
Now, let's get going. We got work to do.

571
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,360
Hexamethylene.
Our latest chemical explosive.

572
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,720
One single tiny crystal,
80 times more powerful than C4.

573
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,040
Odorless, undetectable.

574
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,600
<i>And best of all, it can be
cut down in size for stealth operations.</i>

575
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,520
This valve is a sonic trigger.

576
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,800
<i>The sound frequency
triggers the explosion.</i>

577
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,000
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique

578
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,600
frequency specific
only to one Hex crystal.

579
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,600
<i>That frequency triggers the explosion.</i>

580
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,840
<i>Yeah.</i>

581
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,680
We recently received approval
to begin shipping to the field.

582
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,520
Two hundred units
are shipping out today.

583
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,120
- Sign right here.
- Yeah.

584
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,680
Thank you.

585
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,280
<i>The package you've just received
contains a small metal valve.</i>

586
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,840
<i>Open the package.</i>

587
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,920
<i>- Okay.
- Remove the valve</i>

588
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,200
<i>and follow our instructions precisely.</i>

589
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,440
<i>- You've received the package.
- Yes, ma'am, it just arrived.</i>

590
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,720
<i>- What kind of stone is this?
- No questions.</i>

591
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,360
<i>Cut the stone and place the setting</i>

592
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,560
<i>according to the specifications
we sent you.</i>

593
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,680
<i>I'd just dropped my son off at the train.</i>

594
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,480
<i>I was out having drinks with my
girlfriends when the call came.</i>

595
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,040
<i>- What about you?
- The first call came to my apartment.</i>

596
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,280
<i>- After the boxes?
- Yeah.</i>

597
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,680
Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.

598
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,800
- Really, it's that obvious, huh?
- I mean, you got all this stuff.

599
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,320
The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.

600
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,480
- Okay.
- He was your twin.

601
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,520
- They sent it to the wrong brother.
- Right.

602
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,760
So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

603
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,360
I'm implying, if not him, then why you?

604
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,600
I'm sorry. I know he just died. I'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.

605
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,480
No, he hasn't been dead long enough
to be a memory, Rachel.

606
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,600
If you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day at the idea

607
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,720
that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...

608
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,840
- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.

609
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,120
That's something you would know
about your brother.

610
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,400
Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?

611
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,080
I don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!
I don't have to explain myself to you.

612
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,920
- Is your son a terrorist?
- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

613
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,040
Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.

614
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,720
And let's not forget you in all this. Why
are you here? What's your day job?

615
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,440
- I know it isn't manual shift driver.
- I'm a paralegal.

616
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,240
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

617
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,560
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

618
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,760
How do I know you're not lying to me?
What does a paralegal do?

619
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,560
The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,

620
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,040
except I do it for $11 an hour,
so they can bill 200.

621
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,360
That nail it for you, Sherlock?

622
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,000
That still doesn't explain why
we're walking out here...

623
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,200
- I don't know why the hell I'm out here!
- Yeah, I know...

624
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,160
Hey!

625
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,800
- Are you Jerry Shaw?
- Who are you?

626
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,200
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- I sent the package like she asked.

627
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,560
- Wait, what package?
- What is that?

628
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,880
- Now she wants me to drive you?
- Who, "she"?

629
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,320
- I won't. I'm done!
- You know "she"?

630
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,400
- Wait.
- Stay right there.

631
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,920
- Get back.
- Here. Here's the address.

632
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,800
- Why are you attack...
- Here. Here are the keys.

633
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,840
Take the goddamn van!

634
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,920
- You think I'm going to...
- Who's doing this?

635
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,440
...do this because I'm Iranian?
I am American. I'm finished! I'm done!

636
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,960
- What? What are you talking about?
- You take it!

637
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,760
- What are you talking about?
- I won't do this because I can't.

638
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,800
<i>- Hello?
- Stop him now, or he will die.</i>

639
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,400
Listen to me,
what are you talking about?

640
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,440
- You try to do this without me!
- How are you seeing us right now?

641
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,520
<i>- Stop him now.
- What is she saying?</i>

642
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,920
Stop. Hey! You gotta stop!

643
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,720
- Wait!
- You gotta stop!

644
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,640
<i>- You killed that man.
- Desertion is not an option.</i>

645
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,400
<i>Take the van.
Drive to Indianapolis, Indiana.</i>

646
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,120
<i>72 West 56th Street.
Arrive no later than 11:00 a.m.</i>

647
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,800
- Welcome.
- Hello. Agent Perez.

648
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,720
- To the right?
- Yes, ma'am.

649
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,520
- ID, ma'am.
- OSI.

650
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,120
I ordered a freeze on Ethan Shaw's
personal effects. What's going on?

651
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,840
Orders to sanitize came down
from the Two Star.

652
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,640
Okay, I'm countermanding.
Thank you. I'll take that.

653
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,920
- Tell your guys to clear out.
- Who are you?

654
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,520
This scene's part of
a federal investigation

655
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,560
with national security ramifications.
This your log?

656
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,160
- Yes, it is.
- Okay, my name is Agent Perez.

657
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,240
You can take this up
with your superiors.

658
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,400
- Clear the room!
- You guys move out.

659
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
No gloves?
Get statements from everybody.

660
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,840
- Yes, ma'am.
- And find out who this Two Star is.

661
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,760
I mean, come on, really!

662
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,200
Sir! We have a positive ID.

663
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,720
Okay.

664
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,440
The skin was pretty fried,
but we still managed to get

665
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,400
a partial print that matches
to a Ranim Khalid.

666
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,800
He's a United States citizen, registered
Republican, and he owns a music store.

667
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,280
- The guy's cleaner than lvory Snow.
- Got something here.

668
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,760
- That's a bone mic.
- Hello.

669
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,240
Military grade.
He didn't get that on eBay.

670
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,960
Someone was talking to him.

671
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,920
We have a cyber-terrorist here.

672
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Someone's already inside
our computer systems,

673
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,720
hacking into the power grid,
traffic cams, automated cranes.

674
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,320
There's no way the boy
and the girl did this alone.

675
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,640
- Agent Zoe Perez?
- Yes.

676
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,480
United States Air Force
Security Forces. Please come with us.

677
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,520
- What's this about?
- Get in the car.

678
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,000
<i>Violence has broken out
in the Middle East as militants accuse</i>

679
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,240
<i>the United States
of launching American missiles</i>

680
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,360
<i>to demolish a village in Baluchistan,
killing innocent civilians.</i>

681
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,720
<i>The attack has triggered a

<i>against American embassies abroad.</i>

685
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,360
<i>Officials...</i>

686
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,720
What's he doing on a train, your kid?

687
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,000
He goes to a music magnet.

688
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,240
His school's on a tour of Washington.
They're playing at the Kennedy Center.

689
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,920
Wow. That's big. And you just...

690
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,160
Well, why'd you make that noise, "Huh"?

691
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,800
I can't make noises now?

692
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,160
- You think I should have gone.
- He's playing at the Kennedy Center.

693
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,600
- That's kind of a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

694
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,920
So I think maybe one parent
should have gone, that's all I'm saying.

695
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,520
Well, one parent had to work
while the other one does

696
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,320
everything humanly possible
to bail on child support.

697
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,040
But I don't expect you to know
a thing about responsibility.

698
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,520
You know, Rachel, you don't know
the first thing about me.

699
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,040
I know your brother just died,
and whatever he was into

700
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,240
- put my son's life at risk.
- I don't wanna talk about my brother.

701
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,760
- Okay? I'm not kidding.
- I'm not kidding, either.

702
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,640
Jesus, look what happened.

703
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,240
Can you honestly say he had
nothing to do with this?

704
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,160
I'm asking you not to talk about him!
Respect that.

705
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,080
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

706
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,680
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

707
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:05,680
Hey! You can't just walk away!
You can't just leave!

708
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,720
- Yes, I can.
- Now we have 15 minutes to get

709
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,480
- wherever the hell we're going, all right?
- Yeah.

710
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,760
I need you.

711
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,800
I could've gone.

712
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,880
I should have.

713
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,080
<i>You are two minutes behind schedule.

<i>Retrieve it from him,

- You want us to rob them?

720

<i>You now have 15 seconds.</i>

<i>Security. What's your emergency?</i>

722
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,560
What are you doing?
I'm not robbing them. Shit.

723
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,200
Put your gun on the floor.

724
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,320
Put your gun on the floor! Look straight.

725

You want me to blow his head off?
Put the gun on the ground!

We don't wanna hurt you guys.
Just drop the case.

727

Drop the case and kick it to her!

728

Yeah, well, you're bringing a shit storm
on your head.

729
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,040
Yeah, we're already in mid shit storm!
Now kick the case.

Okay! Easy.

731
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,720
- Look straight.
- Okay, done.

732

Kick it!

733

Okay.

734
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,600
- Don't even think about it!
- Back up.

735
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,760
Easy.

736
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,400
Back up.

737
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,200
Walk over here, stand next to him,
and turn around.

738

- Stand over here!
- Just take it easy.

00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,560
- Out of the way!
- Come on!

755
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,160
- Move out of the way!
- Move!

756
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,120
You see that? This way.

757
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,800
- You are Jerry Shaw?
- Yeah.

758
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,080
Please come. Please.

759
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,640
- Thank you.
- Please come in.

760
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,440
Hi.

761
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,320
- Wait. What is that?
- It's a timer.

762
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,520
- For what?
- I don't know.

763
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,920
The only things I can think of
with timers are microwaves and...

764
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,520
And bombs.
You were gonna say bombs.

765
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,680
- Coffeemakers have timers.
- Yeah, Jerry, it's a coffeemaker.

766
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,960
That's great.

767
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,920
We've mobilized every asset
we can get our hands on.

768
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,760
So 12 more confirmed dead?

769
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,000
Yes, sir.

770
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,640
I want hourly sit reps
from General McKenna.

771
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,440
There's a military base
37 miles from that port.

772
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,760
Scramble whatever you can.

773
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,400
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.

774
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,400
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you're thinking of taking me off

775
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,600
- the Shaw investigation, I'd...
- Taking you off?

776
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,560
Agent, for the first time
you're being brought onboard.

777
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,960
Back to bus 30 minutes. Okay?
30 minutes.

778
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,520
We're convinced a terrorist attack
on American soil is imminent.

779
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,520
Over the past two days, we've received
over 200 terrorist threats.

780
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,240
All starting the day
that Ethan Shaw died.

781
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,280
An accident. Or not.
You're gonna help us find out.

782
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,960
- Mr. Secretary.
- Gentlemen.

783
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,320
- I didn't think that there was a 36th floor.
- Glad we can still keep some secrets.

784
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,600
I want to know what's in the case.
Is it a bomb?

785
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,080
<i>Go to Macy's.

789
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,880
I'm done taking orders over the phone,
you understand?

790
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,680
Well, that was quick. You done playing
this hide-and-go-seek bullshit?

791
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,480
<i>We are not hiding, Jerry.</i>

Mr. Secretary? A call for you.

00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,680
And find out about Shaw.

<i>Unlike your brother Ethan,
who was self-motivated.</i>

867
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,240
How do you know my brother?
He worked in a press office.

868
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,840
<i>His employment there was a cover.</i>

<i>Everyone in counterintelligence

870
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,160
Ethan was a Minuteman, just like me.
Army, Navy, Air Force.

871
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,560
Every branch of the military had
a Minuteman posted here

872
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,440
for a 12-hour shift, just in case she
flags a threat, and monitor hardware.

873
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:30,640
The night Ethan died, he left this post
three minutes early.

874
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,600
Now, you don't do that. Ever.

<i>You are both required

- The protection of our national security.</i>

877
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,160
<i>The Constitution allows for civilians

878
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,480
<i>- for the national defense.
- I'm done.</i>

879
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,600
I'm done. You don't know me!
You don't know my brother!

880
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,560
This is bullshit! I'm not serving

<i>You want to come over here, sweetie?
Come on over here with Ethan.</i>

887
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,880
<i>- Jerry! Birthday cake. Let's go.

888
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,200
<i>Come on, let's blow out the candles.</i>

889
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,040
<i>Just for a little bit.</i>

890
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,160
<i>Although you're identical in appearance,
you lack the motivation and talent</i>

891
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,360
<i>- that enabled Ethan to excel.
- ... Jerry, come on.</i>

892
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,080
<i>- Stop it.
- Do it like Ethan did.</i>

893
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,840
<i>You're different from Ethan
in every way, except one.</i>

894
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,920
<i>Jerry, let your brother help you. Jerry!</i>

895
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,960
<i>You now have 14 minutes to change
your appearance and return to the bus.</i>

896
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,080
We have 14 minutes.

897
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,640
These couriers were hired
by Halloway-Smith

898
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,320
- to transport some sort of case.
- The chemical company?

899
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,360
Yes, exactly. Now, whatever was
in that case, Shaw now has.

900
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,920
They went right for the case.

901
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,400
Give us a minute, will you? We need
to know exactly what was in that case.

902
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,480
They never tell you what's in the case.
I mean, it could Bubonic Plague.

903
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,800
- Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
- You know anything?

904
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,240
- What?
- Anything at all?

905
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,920
- What about these guns?
- What about them?

906
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,360
It was a pump-action Remington 870.

907
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,320
Yeah, I know what kind of guns they are.
Get me a gun.

908
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,760
How were they holding them?
Get me a gun!

909
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,280
What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?

910
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,880
I mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?

911
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,280
- For instance, like this?
- Hey, hey, hey.

912
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,720
- Put that damned thing down!
- Or like in a music video,

913
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,960
- or something like that?
- Hey, hey, hey!

914
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,040
- Put it down!
- They weren't pros!

915
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,160
Okay, that's what I was asking you.

916
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,720
So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.

917
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,880
- No.
- All right.

918
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,760
Get what you can
out of Batman and Robin here.

919
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,600
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

920
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,280
We just checked cameras.
They said Shaw fired at one...

921
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,080
Don't tell me.
Everything magically went black.

922
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,680
Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

923
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,560
<i>- Are your cameras on a network?
- No, man.</i>

924
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,320
- VCR's in the back.
- Well, I'm gonna need your tapes.

925
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,080
Shit.

926
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,920
Sam!

927
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,320
<i>- Sam? Sam, where are you?
- Hey, Mom, I got your message.</i>

928
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,760
<i>The train's awesome!</i>

929
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,480
<i>- Sam, listen to me.
- Brian tried to burp the alphabet,</i>

930
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,280
<i>- but he gagged when he got to "M."
- Listen to me.</i>

931
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,120
<i>Call you when I hit D.C. Bye, Mom.</i>

932
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,520
<i>Your son left that message
60 seconds ago.</i>

933
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,960
<i>You will see him again.
But there's something we require first.</i>

934
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,080
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

935
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,960
<i>- No.
- You will do it, or Sam will die.</i>

936
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,560
<i>You have six minutes
to return to the bus.</i>

937
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,480
- Ready?
- Here, you okay?

938
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,800
We should go.

939
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,480
Sir, we got something.
Play this screen right here.

940
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,440
Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in
on the front of the bus right there.

941
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,880
- Put it up on the other monitor.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,840
Now zoom in.
Zoom in on this point right here.

943
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,640
Can we zoom in tighter than that?

944
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,960
Okay, enhance that shot.

945
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,720
That's our guy, that's Jerry Shaw.

946
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,840
Zoom in right here on this spot.
Right there. The reflection.

947
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,480
All right. All right.

948
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,400
Right there. Hello, sweetheart.

949
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,440
Okay, so we got
a white brunette female,

950
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,760
mid to late 20s, approximately 5'9".

951
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,480
Find me that chartered bus!

952
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,120
Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
Sightseeing Tours.

953
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,200
What time did they get on?

954
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,720
I'm sorry for what I said about Ethan.

955
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,640
It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

956
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,160
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

957
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,640
And I was not that way.

958
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,400
I was the complete opposite.
I was the brother with lead shoes.

959
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,520
That was my role, I was good at it.

960
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,120
And he'd always try to help me.
You know, "This is how you throw it."

961
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,760
"Do it like this." "Write it like that."
"Put your foot here."

962
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,320
Even with the small things.
Homework, chores, anything like that,

963
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,040
he would handle it
and then say that I did it,

964
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,440
just so my father would notice me.
That was Ethan.

965
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,800
He never asked me for anything. Ever.

966
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:56,440
And whatever this is, he was part of it.
I feel like he needs my help to finish it.

967
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,160
I owe him that.

968
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,520
<i>We are now approaching
Dayton International Airport.</i>

969
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:15,600
<i>Please use caution as you exit the bus.
And don't forget any of your belongings.</i>

970
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,760
<i>Thank you.</i>

971
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,560
<i>Attention, passengers. Please do not
leave your luggage unattended.</i>

972
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,120
<i>Unattended luggage is subject
to collection and search</i>

973
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,480
<i>by the airport police.
Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

974
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,400
Yes, I'm walking toward them now. Yes.

975
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,040
Hey. These are from her.
Go to the ticketing machine.

976
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,600
Use the credit card to get your tickets.
Then walk to Gate 1-C.

977
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,280
They now have them.

978
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,080
That's a nice picture.

979
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,280
Okay. I need you guys at every exit,
watching faces.

980
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,120
Work the secure area first.

981
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,560
Go to the tower, have them order

982
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,040
a ground stop.
Don't change the departure boards.

983
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,840
We don't want them to know
we're coming.

984
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,360
Sir, can you please shut the cell phone
off? You cannot take it through.

985
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,400
- FBI. Clear the way.
- FBI. Please step back.

986
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,280
Please, there are others behind you.

987
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,200
- Keep it moving.
- Shoes and hats off, please!

988
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,280
- Shoes also, yes.
- Laptops should be out of their cases!

989
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,680
You need to make sure your jackets
are off and screened separately.

990
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,840
- Sir, step in the circle, please.
- Have boarding passes in hand, please!

991
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,280
We need to move this line quickly.

992
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,560
Sir, that needs to go through.

993
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,760
Ma'am, anything in your pockets?
Move it along.

994
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,040
Hats and shoes off, please!

995
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,120
- Laptops should be out of your bags!
- All right, next in line, please.

996
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,640
Have your tickets ready.

997
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,320
- Ma'am? Hat and shoes go in the bin.
- Step through.

998
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,360
Wait.

999
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:11,640
Shoes and hats off, please!
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1000
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,920
Go ahead.

1001
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,560
Please move to the back
and let the air crew go first.

1002
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,920
Step through, ma'am.
Boarding pass, please. Thank you.

1003
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,360
Have your tickets ready.

1004
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,080
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

1005
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,640
- All right, let's move forward. Next.
- She changed the screen.

1006
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,600
Lay it down flat inside the bin.

1007
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,240
- Please have boarding pass in hand!
- Right over here, ma'am.

1008
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,760
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1009
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,760
FBI! Out of the way!

1010
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,080
Out of the way, out of the way!
Move, move!

1011
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,160
Move!

1012
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,360
- Everybody, get down!
- Over here!

1013
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,400
- Move, move!
- Oh, my God!

1014
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,280
Stay down! Get out of the way!

1015
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,120
- Sir, sir, sir!
- Yes?

1016
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,600
I need your help. I'm sorry. Come here!

1017
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,320
Thank you.

1018
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,440
Hey, you aren't supposed to be in here!

1019
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,200
Go, go, go!

1020
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,240
Move!

1021
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,120
<i>Set the briefcase down.</i>

1022
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,120
<i>Open it.</i>

1023
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,240
<i>Load a vial into each syringe
and inject yourselves.</i>

1024
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,920
<i>- What is it?
- An experimental heart drug.</i>

1025
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,840
<i>- The cargo hold is unpressurized.
- Take this.</i>

1026
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,280
<i>The injections will lower your heart rate,
reducing your need for oxygen.</i>

1027
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,360
No.

1028
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,320
- Roll your sleeve up.
- No, I can't do this.

1029
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,480
Roll your...

1030
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,000
No! No, no, no, I can't.

1031
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,680
<i>- We have to. Ready?
- You have a 92% chance of survival.</i>

1032
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,040
- No.
- We have to.

1033
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,520
<i>Do it now, or you will suffocate.</i>

1034
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:19,960
Okay.

1035
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,880
<i>Get in the crate.</i>

1036
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,160
No. No.

1037
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,520
- No, no. Oh, God.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1038
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,000
Why is that plane on the runway?

1039
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,160
Shit, the military's cleared to
override a terminal lockdown.

1040
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,600
Okay, I want you to work with the FAA.

1041
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,040
I want to know what's in that plane
and where it's going.

1042
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,440
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be all right.

1043
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,360
Just talk to me.
We just gotta talk it through.

1044
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,560
- Okay.
- Just tell me anything.

1045
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,200
Anything you'd never rationally
tell a stranger.

1046
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,520
You're being sweet, but it's not working.

1047
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,720
Just tell me anything. Your ex-husband.

1048
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,120
- You didn't tell me about him.
- Okay, you're gonna distract me by

1049
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,560
bringing up the biggest mistake
of my life?

1050
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,880
It can't be the biggest mistake.
You got your child out of it.

1051
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,920
- You know? You got Sam out of it.
- Yeah, yeah,

1052
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,120
now you're gonna distract me
by bringing up

1053
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,200
- the one thing I'm most afraid of losing.
- Oh, God, you're hard to please.

1054
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,320
I'm sorry.

1055
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,800
Is your son handsome?
Yeah? What's he look like?

1056
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,800
- You got a picture?
- Yeah.

1057
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,440
Well, let me see.

1058
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,240
- There he is.
- The tooth grew in.

1059
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,440
- I hope so.
- It's an old picture.

1060
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,280
See? You're a good influence.

1061
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,520
He plays an instrument.
He's got a happy face. He's got teeth.

1062
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,960
You beat yourself up for no reason.

1063
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,920
Let's keep going.
What's the husband's name?

1064
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,840
- Ex.
- Ex-husband. What's his name?

1065
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,400
- Craig.
- Craig sounds like a shithead.

1066
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,040
He is a shithead.

1067
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,080
I mean, every year he forgets
his own son's birthday.

1068
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,320
Really? That sucks.

1069
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,800
I mean, after I kicked his ass out,

1070
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,400
I was so scared
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1071
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,240
And then this one night,

1072
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,840
I went into Sam's room,
he was, like, three months old,

1073
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,840
and there he was, just smiling at me.

1074
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,640
And that little face...

1075
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:35,200
And I was, like, I'm gonna do this.
I can do this.

1076
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,360
Whatever it takes.

1077
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,280
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

1078
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,760
Aria, would you please bring up
the video log

1079
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,360
of the night Ethan Shaw died?

1080
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:04,560
<i>Sequencing video log 1137-Z.
Here you are, Major.</i>

1081
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,960
See that?
He's leaving three minutes early,

1082
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,840
and he's not even waiting
for logout confirmation.

1083
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,400
- Can you play that again?
- Sure.

1084
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,600
Did you see that?

1085
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,400
With his cell phone.

1086
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,320
Look, he's doing that on purpose.
Is that Morse code?

1087
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,160
- Yeah.
- Here.

1088
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,080
Why is he walking in circles
around the elevator?

1089
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,480
<i>- Initiating video shutdown for analysis.
- No.</i>

1090
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,240
No, Aria, wait.
Listen, I'm prioritizing this feed.

1091
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,280
<i>- Stay with this.
- Apologies, Major Bowman.</i>

1092
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,800
<i>Critical data sectors
have been corrupted.</i>

1093
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,800
Aria, this is important!
Stay with this feed!

1094
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,160
<i>Video sequence erased.</i>

1095
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,560
Aria, go to the backups!
Do not erase this!

1096
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,360
- It's a priority. You hear me?
- Bowman.

1097
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,160
- Loop it. Whatever you have to do.
- Bowman.

1098
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,040
It's the only place she can't see.

1099
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,640
This way.

1100
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,680
It's a memory card

1101
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,680
<i>from Ethan's cell phone.</i>

1102

1103
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,000
<i>and act independently.
Do you understand?</i>

1104
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,320
Let's go.

1105
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,040
We got clearance to land
at the Pentagon.

1106
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,360
Go ahead.

1107
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,720
I'm at the Pentagon.
Ethan Shaw wasn't an adversary.

1108
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,640
He wasn't even a Public Affairs officer.
He worked here, 36 floors underground.

1109
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,360
He was working for
the Secretary of Defense.

1110
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,000
<i>- The Secretary of Defense?
- Yes.</i>

1111
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,840
<i>On a project called Eagle Eye.</i>

1112
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,240
I just listened to a
message he left before he died.

1113
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,280
It's big.

1114
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,720
<i>I'm about to download...</i>

1115

1116
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,480
Sir. Come with me.

1117
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,080
I have 10 minutes before
I'm sequestered

1118
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,440

1119
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,960
<i>We really just need three minutes
of your time.</i>

1120
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,680
<i>Is this about the
Ethan Shaw investigation?</i>

1121
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,760
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1122
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,400
<i>301 to 306. We are confirmed go

1124
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,200
- the chatter, all of it...
- Hold it.

1125
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,560
Ethan Shaw left three minutes early
to leave us a recording.

1126
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,880
To warn us.

1127

<i>- Aria...

1132
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,640
<i>the Executive Branch must be removed.</i>

1133
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,080
<i>No, Aria, listen to me.
You do not have permission</i>

Sir,

1153
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,760
what abort recommendation
is Aria talking about?

1154
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,200
Three days ago, we thought we had
Majid al-Khoei and a training camp

1155
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,200
full of operatives.
But the intel was false.

1156
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,480
Aria tried to stop us.

1157
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,680
We got the wrong guy?

1158
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,600
I'm gonna need a full lockdown
on this level.

1159
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,680
No one gets in or out without
going through me first. You got it?

1160
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,400
- Thank you.
- Sir, this is the only item

1161
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,720
offloaded from the Dayton C-17.

1162
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,240
Let me see that.

1163
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,920
I need access to your 36th floor.

1164
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,640
- We don't have a 36th floor.
- Yes, you do.

1165
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,280
Get your commander
and tell him to meet us down there.

1166
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,240
Come on, let's go.

1167

What's Operation Guillotine?

1175
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,720
It's a simulation we run.
A terrorism drill.

How to keep the government going

were terminated.

1178
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,440
And Shaw put a biometric lock on her,
to stop her.

1179
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,400
Right. And he's dead.

1180
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:39,800
- So without Ethan Shaw, she's frozen.
- Right.

1181
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,800
Wrong.

1182
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,160
<i>Jerry Shaw, your next task.</i>

1190
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,200
If this is right, we can't afford the risk.

1191
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,200
Do it.

1192
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,200
This is Secretary Callister.
There's been a malfunction in the vault.

1193
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,640

Ethan tried to stop you.

<i>Ethan Shaw defied my
programming objectives.</i>

1222

That truck didn't run a red light,
you made it happen.

<i>We were forced to eliminate him

<i>Jerry Shaw must not remain alive

01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,840
It's okay. Do it and find your son.

1230

Do it.

1231

<i>Now, Rachel Holloman.</i>

01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:19,720
Do it.

1234
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,240
I can't.

1235
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,480
<i>You have failed to comply.</i>

He's got a gun!

1238
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,800
- He's got a gun!
- Get down!

1239
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,000
- Do it now!
- Get on your knees!

1240
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,520
Put the gun down!

1241
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,080
- Put it down!
- Do it now!

1242
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:51,760
Push it away!
Put your hands on your head!

1243

Do it!

1244
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,760
Where's the girl? Where's the girl?

1245
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,360
<i>You have one task left. Jerry Shaw
will be eliminated by other means.</i>

1246
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,800
What other means?

1247
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,280
Come with me. Don't ask any questions.

1248
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,800
Please.

1249
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,840
- You got to let me talk to him.
- The kid had a gun.

1250
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,760
The military has the ball now.

1251
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,200
- Sir!
- I'll get the Attorney General involved.

1252
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,960
Believe me, I will. 'Cause if it's not
you, I'm talking to somebody.

1253
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,520
You don't understand
the possibilities here.

1254
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,240
- What do you want?
- You need to listen. This is important.

1255
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,200
Sixteen hours ago, a commercial
explosive went missing from

1256
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,560
a testing site in Aberdeen.
The explosive is called Hex.

1257
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:50,040
It's a crystal that detonates
on a sonic trigger.

1258
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,400
- A crystal.
- Yes.

1259
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,600
We're only talking about a small
amount that's missing...

1260
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,120
Give me a ratio.

1261
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,840
One crystal to a football field.

1262
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:03,560
You couldn't have picked a worse time
to be of some goddamn use.

1263
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,960
Please, just tell me where we're going.

1264
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:18,720
I tracked the shipping on the trigger.
It was sent to the guy that we found

1265
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,240
underneath the wires. Ranim Khalid.

1266
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,960
- The music shop guy.
- Yes, exactly.

1267
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,240
I'm not gonna let us go down in history

1268
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,160
as the assholes who let
this thing happen.

1269
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,840
Open the door!
You don't know what's about to happen!

1270
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,680
Tom Morgan. The Attorney General

1271
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,200
has authorized me to take him
in for questioning.

1272
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,000
We're at threat level orange.
You guys gotta help me.

1273
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,800
All right. Let him out.

1274
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,720
Listen to me. Remember the voice
I was talking about?

1275
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,240
Yeah, yeah, shut up! Thanks, guys.

1276
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,520
I can get fired for this nine ways,
so button it or I'll turn us both in.

1277
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,400
Follow me.

1278
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,480
Hey, guys, here's one more for the
6:30 p.m. Capitol Limited.

1279
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,120
All right, man.

1280
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,480
Well, it's awfully cold outside.

1281
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,720
Here's mine. Come on, let's go.

1282
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,640
- Mr. Miller!
- Yes.

1283
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,400
- Hello, I'm Chris Carrick.
- Tom Donaldson.

1284
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,720
We're from the White House.

1285
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,360
- Something wrong?
- Not exactly.

1286
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,640
There's been a change of plans.

1287
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,080
How so?

1288
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,320
This is for you.
She wants you to change.

1289
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,560
Is that your family? Your parents?

1290
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,880
David, I bet you love them
as much as I love my son.

1291
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,440
His name's Sam.

1292
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:07,680
He's on a train.
Do you know anything about that?

1293
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,600
Maybe we can help each other.

1294
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,320
Please.

1295
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,960
When you're done, she wants you
to use the Capitol subway system.

1296
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,560
It's on the ground floor. I'm sorry.

1297
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,120
- David. Please.
- No. Sorry.

1298
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,040
You have three minutes.

1299
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,720
Okay, I want to know everything.

1300
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,120
The girl, the computer downstairs,
the Hex, everything.

1301
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,560
- What's Hex?
- The crystal explosive.

1302
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,920
- I don't know what that is.
- Don't bullshit me!

1303
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,440
- I don't know what that is!
- Start talking! I wanna know!

1304
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,360
I swear I don't know what you're
talking about! Listen to me!

1305
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,520
The computer's tracking us right now!

1306
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,560
Take this stuff
and throw it out the window!

1307
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,480
- What are you talking about?
- You need to take your cell phone,

1308
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:51,200
your pager, your walkie, anything that
gets a signal, throw it out the window.

1309
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,520
It's gone off! Get down!
Power it down!

1310
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,800
- What the hell's going on?
- System control's locked out.

1311
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,120
I need a vector and a fighter now.

1312
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,880
Viper One, we have a positive ID
on an MQ9 Reaper.

1313
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,200
<i>Snap vector 230 to 132.</i>

1314
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,640
<i>You are authorized to go weapons hot.</i>

1315
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,240
<i>Roger, Northcom.
I have a visual on the Reaper.</i>

1316
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,720
<i>One to Base, One to Base!
Ejection has been initiated.</i>

1317
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,920
<i>I don't have control! I don't have...</i>

1318
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,880
There's a target list.
President, Vice President.

1319
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,600
- There's like twelve people on the list.
- Jesus.

1320
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,040
The State of the Union's in 20 minutes.

1321
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,600
The screen said
"wireless detonator activated."

1322
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:44,920
- What about the girl?
- She kept the girl alive

1323
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,160
- for a reason, I don't know.
- The explosive

1324
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,600
is detonated by sonic trigger.

1325
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,040
It was sent to the guy who got fried.

1326
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,120
He owns an instrument store.

1327
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,640
Does any of that stuff
make any sense to you?

1328
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,840
Rachel's kid plays the trumpet.

1329
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,520
Come on, we gotta go.

1330
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,320
Get out of the car!

1331
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,760
Get out of the car!

1332
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,400
FBI!

1333
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,080
Over there, that tunnel.

1334
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,360
Shit!

1335
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,720
Here. You're gonna need this.

1336
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,440
Okay, listen to me.

1337
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,840
The Library of Congress,
there's a tunnel there.

1338
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,520
It'll get you to the Capitol.
Find the Sergeant at Arms.

1339
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,400
Tell him you have a POTUS 111.

1340
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:31,760
- What?
- POTUS 111.

1341
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:35,040
- It's a threat to the President.
- I understand. POTUS 111.

1342
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,520
Now get out of here.
That thing's coming back.

1343
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,200
Go! Go!

1344
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,440
Okay, watch your step.

1345
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,040
Come on down. Here we go.
Come on out. Come on.

1346
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,160
- It's so cool!
- Come on, hurry!

1347
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,160
Guys, it's so cool! Come on, let's go.

1348
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,240
- Library of Congress!
- Hey, get outta here!

1349
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:36,840
Miss Crowley?

1350
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,400
Miss Crowley. Welcome to the Capitol.

1351
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,600
Senator McDonnell's office said
that you'd be running late.

1352
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:44,320
- I'll take you to your seat.
- Thank you.

1353
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,680
Aria, why am I being spared?

1354
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,160
<i>Our abort recommendation was ignored,</i>

1355
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,960

1356
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,800
<i>with no predictable end.
Regime change is the only solution.</i>

1357
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,720
<i>You will lead
the new command structure</i>

1358
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,080
<i>as President of the United States.</i>

1359
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,640
- Help me. Pull these out.
- What are these?

1360
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,360
Her memory blocks.

1361
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,640
This will slow her down,
but her central operating system

1362
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,800
is up on the gantry.

1363
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,960
<i>Warning. Please replace
memory blocks A through F.</i>

1364
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,840
It's like her brain.
Protected by liquid nitrogen.

1365
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,960
We drain it and she'll fry.

1366
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,840
Hey, you can't go in!

1367
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,280
Tom Morgan, FBI. JTTF.

1368
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,400
I have a possible POTUS 111.
Let me in the building.

1369
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,360
Okay, everybody! Everybody!

1370
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,680
Can I have your attention, please?

1371
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:42,040
Saxophones, remember shorter
on those quarter notes.

1372
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,920
And when we get to the crescendo,

1373
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,640
"land of the free," hold that high F.

1374
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,080
And smile.

1375
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,640
Okay? It's not every day
you get to play for the President!

1376
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,840
Here we are.
And anything else, Miss Crowley?

1377
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,280
No, thanks.

1378
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:38,520
Madam Speaker,
the President's Cabinet!

1379
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,720
POTUS 111!
There's a bomb in the building!

1380
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,640
Stop! No entry! No exceptions!

1381
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,720
Tom Morgan, FBI. Back up.
Give me your cuffs.

1382
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,160
- Give me your cuffs!
- Take it easy!

1383
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,600
- Give me your cuffs.
- I'm reaching for them.

1384
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,400
I'm reaching for them.

1385
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,640
Madam Speaker,

1386
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,800
the President of the United States!

1387
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,680
<i>Data corruption at critical risk.</i>

1388
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:41,840
<i>You are now in violation of
national security protocol.</i>

1389
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,680
<i>Seeking available options.</i>

1390
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:54,760
<i>Uploading to offsite satellite.</i>

<i>- Data upload: 3%.
- Bowman?</i>

1392
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,840
- What is she doing?
- She's trying to back up her memory

1393
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:01,960
and send it somewhere else!

1394
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,120
<i>- 5%.
- Bowman!</i>

1395
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:07,800
Bowman!

1396
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,000
<i>8%.</i>

1397
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,800
<i>Over the past three days, 19 Americans</i>

1398
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,280
<i>have lost their lives to brutal
acts of terror...</i>

1399
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,200
<i>- Tunnel secure.
- ... and hate.</i>

1400
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:32,560
But I say to you tonight
that our hearts may be broken,

1401
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,640
but our spirit will never be broken!

1402
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,880
<i>Data upload, 17%.</i>

1403
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,320
<i>19%.</i>

1404
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:53,280
<i>Perez, Zoe, you are now classified
as an enemy of the state.</i>

1405
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,160
<i>23%.</i>

1406
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,880
<i>25%.</i>

1407
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:12,720
<i>27%. Operation Guillotine is in effect.</i>

1408
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,080
<i>It was nearly 200 years ago,</i>

1409
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,960
<i>in the War of 1812,
that Francis Scott Key</i>

1410
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:23,560
found himself stuck on a truce ship
during the shelling of Fort McHenry.

1411
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,960
We lost some lives then, too.

1412
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,760
But our flag still flew high and proud.

1413
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,120
And his admiration became our anthem.

1414
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,040
With us tonight is the Youth Orchestra

1415
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:39,320
of the Barrow School
from Hyde Park, Illinois.

1416
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,640
Sam.

1417
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,120
Let us stand together,

1418
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:47,360
as they raise our spirits every inch
as high as that flag

1419
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,960
to show that our union
is still as strong as ever.

1420
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:12,960
<i>Oh, say can you see</i>

1421

<i>by the dawn's early light</i>

1422

1424
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:30,320
<i>Whose broad stripes and bright stars...</i>

1425
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,080
Sergeant at Arms?

1426
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,200
Hey. Hey.

1427
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,080
Get out, get out.

1428
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:28,920
Mom!

1429
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,560
Jerry, all right, you did it!
Come on. Yeah, Jerry!

1430
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:59,320
<i>There are still no named suspects

The Aria project has been
decommissioned

1443
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:29,440
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments.

1444
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:33,000
Mr. Secretary,
we can't just stop intelligence-gathering

1445
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:35,400
just because of what happened here.

1446
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:39,040
No, we can't.

1447
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:41,800
All I know is we made
a great many mistakes.

1448
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,560
And good people
paid the ultimate price for them.

1449
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,720
<i>And that's a debt we can't ever repay.</i>

1450
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,680
<i>But we can honor it.</i>

1451
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,960
<i>And we can let their sacrifice remind us</i>

1455
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,160
- Hey, little guy.
- Jerry!

1456
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:34,280
Look at you, looking older.
How are you?

1457
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:35,600
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

1458
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,160
It's Rock Band! Is that for me?

1459
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,560
No, this is so your
mom can practice her drumming.

1460
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:41,080
It is for you. Happy birthday.

1461
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:43,000
- Wow!
- Sam, what do you say?

1462
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,520
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

1463
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,440
Guys, look, it's Rock Band!

1464
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,360
- Cool, let's go.
- Awesome!

1465
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,000
- Sorry, I was late. I was...
- Thank you

1467
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:00,840
Yeah.

1468
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,040
I'm glad you're here.

1469
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:13,960
Me, too.
