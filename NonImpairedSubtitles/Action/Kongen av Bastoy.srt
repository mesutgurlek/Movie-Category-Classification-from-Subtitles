1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,699
The School of Bastøy
existed from 1900-1953

2
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,005
It was a school for misfitted young boys.

3
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,030
This film was based on true events.

4
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:03,055
I once saw a whale swim
with three harpoons in it.

5
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:09,904
It took an entire day to die.

6
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:19,621
We found the wale again, and proceeded to
come closer, closer than we had ever come before.

7
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:23,544
He was weaker due to the
harpoon I shot him with, 

8
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,581
covered with scars from all 
the battles he had fought.

9
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,500
It is not as strict as they say it is.

10
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,985
They have Sundays free.

11
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,464
Shut up.

12
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The  King  Of  Devil's  Island

13
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:20,976
They will enter cell C. That is
your responsibility, until you leave.

14
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:25,459
- What is it now, three weeks?
- Yes, Bestyrer.

15
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:27,743
Ensure that they learn.

16
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:39,401
No tobacco, no alcohol,
no civilian clothes,

17
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:41,926
no games, cards, or dice.

18
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:44,851
No discussion during work.

19
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:48,351
- No obscene behavior,
no personal belongings.

20
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:52,741
What is this?
Private asset?

21
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:58,145
Address me as House-Father Bråthen.
C5, C19, these are is your numbers.

22
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:01,457
Take off your clothes,
fold them, and place here.

23
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:03,696
You will receive new clothes
down below in the barracks.

24
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:05,060
One thing.

25
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:09,415
I observe everything.
I see everything, I hear everything.

26
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:14,137
And I write everything down in my book.
Is that understood?

27
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,143
Sit on your hands.

28
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:32,657
Stand straight.

29
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:38,737
Take down your hands.

30
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:57,538
What happened to your face?

31
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,375
Police.

32
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:04,221
It could have been a lot worse
if you had been in prison.

33
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:06,294
Hence why I ensured that you
made your way here.

34
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:10,217
Since you're a sailor you know
how important discipline is.

35
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:14,298
You're part of the crew
with one common goal.

36
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:16,301
Yes.

37
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:18,456
Yes, Mr. Bestyrer.

38
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,738
Yes, Bestyrer.

39
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:21,934
Yes, Mr. Bestyrer.

40
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,740
Yes, Mr. Bestyrer.

41
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:31,421
I'm your captain and this
island is my vessel.

42
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:35,291
The House-Parents are my mates,
the boy C1 , Olav Fossen, 

43
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,578
he is one of you.

44
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:39,175
However, he is your leader.

45
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:43,171
Our goal, and your goal is to find,

46
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:47,335
the honorable, humble, useful,
Christian boy inside you.

47
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:52,257
And we're going to shape and polish him.
If we do not find him...

48
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:54,219
you'll remain here.

49
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,500
Do you understand?

50
00:06:56,662 --> 00:06:59,255
Yes, Mr. Bestyrer.

51
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:03,338
At this island, we don't speak about
what anyone has done, or participated in.

52
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:07,289
There is no past nor future.
There is only the present.

53
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:09,499
If whole world crumbles under the waves,

54
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:12,892
it has nothing to do with us,
isn't that true, C-19?

55
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,333
Yes, Mr. Bestyrer.

56
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:21,777
Learn the rules and follow them.
So we see that you get what you need.

57
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,500
Bråthen.

58
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:25,534
Bråthen!

59
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:32,654
Cabin coordinator C1 will perhaps leave us
soon, and his space will soon be available.

60
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,851
What an ambitious and dedicated young man.

61
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,858
You can go now.

62
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,297
Is that him?

63
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,858
I don't like the idea of having
someone like him here.

64
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,612
This place is about to disintegrate.

65
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,248
- I can no longer be here.
- Stop.

66
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,769
C-1 to 6 will clear the northern field.
C-8 to 12 will shovel fertilizer with Bjarne.

67
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:16,851
Hey! Anyone who complains,
will receive the same job tomorrow.

68
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:20,329
New-boy, C-19, you have outhouse duties.

69
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:24,617
Is there anyone here who will volunteer
to show 19 how this will be done?

70
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:27,134
I'll show him.

71
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:38,415
We call it America because the
house-parents don't come down here.

72
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:40,968
This is where we live in peace.

73
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:47,739
You'll get used to it.

74
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:54,094
I'm not going to be here very long.

75
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:26,489
C-5, come with me,
we need a man in laundry.

76
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,933
There was someone who tried once.

77
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:49,488
However, it hasn't happened
since I've been here.

78
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:51,454
It's too far across.

79
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:54,654
- When did you come here?
- Six years ago.

80
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:57,570
You must love it here.

81
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:02,728
Is it true that you killed someone?

82
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:07,731
I thought we didn't talk about
what we've done before.

83
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,052
The boathouse is closed.
You can't get in there.

84
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:20,013
The only way out from the island
is the manager's signature

85
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:24,294
- And you're getting it?
- Yeah, I get it when the committee comes.

86
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:27,687
You're like the captain's cabin boy.

87
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:24,532
Arni, come.
Arni!

88
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:49,570
Put up your hand.

89
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:54,330
Hold it still!

90
00:12:00,573 --> 00:12:05,283
He hasn't learned the rules yet.
But he wants to, right?

91
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:07,171
Yes, Bestyrer.

92
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:12,647
He wants to get away from here,
and he will.

93
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:15,611
When he's earned it.

94
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:18,048
Yes, Bestyrer.

95
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:13,566
Is that your mom?

96
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:43,287
Lights out.

97
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,767
I can't find it.
I can't find it.

98
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,398
My clock.
House-father!

99
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,606
Be quiet.
Go to bed now.

100
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,039
I can't find it.

101
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,241
Help me.

102
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,007
Get up!

103
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:09,524
Down, down, down!

104
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:11,167
Let, let me go.

105
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,081
Hand's down.
Hand's down.

106
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,603
C-5.

107
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,646
Thanks, house-father.

108
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:38,358
Be quiet!

109
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:40,601
I see everything.

110
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:45,318
I hear everything.

111
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,645
Up!

112
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:40,235
''Thus began my life now what
which was just comfortable.''

113
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:43,364
''So that I occasionally,
say to myself 

114
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:47,644
that I could just be safe from
multiple visits by the savages,

115
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:53,960
so it would not bother me if I
moved from the place where I lived.''

116
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:56,323
C-19.

117
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:07,001
C-19.

118
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:15,315
''I was certainly out of order
to kill a kid of my flock.''

119
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:17,874
''Carry it home and make it right.''

120
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:22,880
"But along the way, I saw a goat's
shadow with to young kids with him."

121
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:42,762
Want me to read them for you?

122
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:58,600
C-5?

123
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:07,358
Congratulations.

124
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:11,755
The manager decided that you'll
sing for the committee.

125
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:15,117
That means we must practice.

126
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:31,199
Who is Elsa?

127
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:33,281
Just read.

128
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:39,960
"Dear Erling. I'm frightened
when I look beyond the ocean

129
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:42,762
and think that you're out there.''

130
00:18:43,003 --> 00:18:46,756
''I miss you terribly now.''

131
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:52,113
Keep reading.

132
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:56,760
" I'm trying to remember you.
How you laughed when you were last here."

133
00:18:56,922 --> 00:19:01,040
''When you didn't even know
what a harpoon was.''

134
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:05,354
Harpooner. The man which stands
in front of the boat and shoots it.

135
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:07,194
Was that you?

136
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:09,393
Just continue.

137
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:16,836
"I thought I saw you the other day.
I see you everywhere."

138
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,881
''I hope you come back before christmas.
Like you promised.''

139
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:23,671
Long before christmas.

140
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:26,514
Haven't you told her where you are?

141
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:35,271
- I think there is more.
- Read it then.

142
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,155
If you're going to be here, you 
must learn to behave yourself.

143
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:40,152
Are you going to teach me that?

144
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:44,434
What have they done to you?

145
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,116
Stand still.

146
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,399
Everything okay, C-5?

147
00:21:24,598 --> 00:21:26,509
The ear.

148
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:39,033
It doesn't look like we're
going to get rid of your smell.

149
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:43,476
That's how it is when you're born
out of your mothers ass.

150
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:56,630
Liquor?
Is that liquor I smell?

151
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,227
Section C.

152
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:08,706
We're going to continue
this inspection every day,

153
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:11,835
until there is peace in barracks C.

154
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,832
Is it funny? Then we will
find something funny for you.

155
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:52,307
C-19.

156
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:54,354
Stand straight!

157
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,146
Stand straight!

158
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:03,154
Yes.

159
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:06,868
This is quite meaningless, huh?

160
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:11,303
Just like your behavior this morning.

161
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,431
I'm sorry, Mr. Bestyrer.

162
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:16,185
No, you're not.

163
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:22,349
It's just that I don't
belong here, manager.

164
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:30,107
Yes, you do, you see.
You belong here.

165
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,743
You can put down the stone.

166
00:23:38,915 --> 00:23:45,308
Now take these stones, and place them
back in a pile where they belong.

167
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:07,304
So you think your strong do you?

168
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:10,185
We will see.

169
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:20,467
"Dear Erling, I'm frightened 
when I look beyond the ocean

170
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:23,193
and think that you're out there.''

171
00:24:23,353 --> 00:24:25,230
"I miss you..."

172
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:27,349
Erling, let him go!

173
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:01,062
Særavdelingen.

174
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:04,904
Forestry...
Half rations.

175
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:02,420
Your mother lives in Horten, right?

176
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:06,549
I thought maybe she could invite me over.

177
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:10,908
to dinner, for example.
Maybe six or seven days?

178
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,458
Stop turning the saw, you idiot.
You'll break the blade.

179
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,505
That is isolation.

180
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,028
Ow, shit!

181
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:53,304
The last boy which was
put in isolation, 

182
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:58,060
he hit his head against the wall
so he couldn't talk anymore.

183
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:07,741
- Have you never tried to run away?
- Yea. One time.

184
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:12,585
I jumped on the mail boat,
but I was only eleven.

185
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:15,987
What'd you do when you were eleven,
in order to come here?

186
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,182
I stole from a church.

187
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:26,462
Help me to write a letter.
A story.

188
00:27:27,908 --> 00:27:29,421
To whom?

189
00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:33,741
Somebody.

190
00:27:34,748 --> 00:27:36,227
About what?

191
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:41,737
A story of the sea.
Sailors on a ship. With me on board.

192
00:27:48,348 --> 00:27:50,578
Did you see the whale?

193
00:27:50,748 --> 00:27:55,822
I saw a whale swim
with three harpoons in it.

194
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:58,377
It took an entire day to die.

195
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,423
What should I be then?

196
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,899
Deck boy...

197
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:15,579
And I will be the harpooner.

198
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:06,734
You shouldn't eat that.

199
00:29:06,906 --> 00:29:08,578
You'll get sick.

200
00:29:25,425 --> 00:29:28,303
Bestyrer.
We've learned.

201
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,616
And what have we learned?

202
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:35,977
That we're all on the same ship,
Mr. Bestyrer.

203
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:55,693
Give me your rabbit, Aksel.
I'm hungry, I need more food.

204
00:29:55,864 --> 00:29:57,820
Stay away!

205
00:29:57,984 --> 00:30:00,339
- I just want to pet him.
- Stay away.

206
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:02,813
I'm just going to pet him.

207
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:05,744
It's a her, not a him!

208
00:30:21,064 --> 00:30:25,137
C-9 and C-19 requesting
permission to use the outhouse.

209
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:48,097
C-19 is a problem.
We should be harder.

210
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:51,420
They should punish him more,
and keep him separate.

211
00:30:51,703 --> 00:30:55,742
Discipline without compassion
is heartless, we've talked about this.

212
00:30:55,943 --> 00:31:00,494
We are role models for these boys,
we must not be heartless.

213
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:02,733
Bestyrer.

214
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:07,020
Now I speak not only for myself,
I have really nothing to complain about.

215
00:31:07,182 --> 00:31:09,696
I have been here for 9 years.

216
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:12,581
I haven’t asked for a penny
more in pay, but...

217
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:15,210
the parliament church and
School Committee sets the salary.

218
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:17,771
You have to talk to them.

219
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:20,261
I know that, but...

220
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:25,542
to be a house-father is important,
but it is no lifetime job.

221
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:30,935
An ambitious man, would
have left a long time ago.

222
00:31:32,302 --> 00:31:34,054
Good Night.

223
00:31:35,142 --> 00:31:36,894
Bråthen?

224
00:31:38,582 --> 00:31:43,053
Bråthen, you're doing a great job.
Good night.

225
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:48,974
We need help to bring in the wheat.

226
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,540
You're doing the laundry.

227
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:54,137
Please, let me help you
in the field. Please.

228
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:57,737
- Can you handle a pitchfork?
- Yes.

229
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:06,413
Come on!

230
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:09,973
Come on!

231
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:23,330
Where did you hide the saw blade?

232
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,695
They won't find it.

233
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,420
Promise me that you wont 
escape before I leave?

234
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,774
Yes.

235
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,091
It's not long from now.

236
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,854
Hey, what are you looking at?

237
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,136
Bastøy boy.

238
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,058
Here you are.

239
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,972
C-5?

240
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,137
C-5?

241
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:13,497
Let me see your hand.
Come here.

242
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:34,732
They're wrapping it together.

243
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:27,008
What is it?

244
00:34:37,697 --> 00:34:40,086
Turn on the lights!

245
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:48,333
Get help! Hurry!

246
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:26,565
Come on.
Come on, we gotta leave now.

247
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:29,323
We're leaving now.
Do you want to stay here?

248
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,889
Do you want to stay here?

249
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:31,128
Go back to the infirmary, Ivar.

250
00:36:31,294 --> 00:36:33,091
Take me with, Erling.
Please, I'm begging you.

251
00:36:33,254 --> 00:36:34,164
Go!

252
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:38,486
I want to come, I can help
you row when you're tired.

253
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:40,726
Please!

254
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:47,446
I don't want to be here anymore,
I can't do it!

255
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:51,047
Please, Erling.

256
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:53,364
Please!

257
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:56,043
Go back, lvar.

258
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:59,723
I can't have a wussy with me.

259
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:32,810
What?
You're not in the infirmary?

260
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:38,605
Where have you been?

261
00:37:38,772 --> 00:37:41,650
I have been talking to someone.

262
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:44,485
Have you been down to the beach?

263
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:47,246
Have you been with C-19?

264
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:18,205
Gossip pussy!

265
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:37,562
Bråthen?

266
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:38,844
Yes, Mr. Bestyrer?

267
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:42,160
How long have you been on Bastøy?

268
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:44,718
- 9 years
- 9 years...

269
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:47,961
Has anyone managed to escape
during that time?

270
00:39:48,128 --> 00:39:51,006
- No.

271
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:55,961
So this boy, C-19,

272
00:39:57,048 --> 00:39:58,800
has to be a kind of hero.

273
00:39:59,368 --> 00:40:01,928
The first to successfully
escape Bastøy.

274
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:06,525
But he is no hero.
He is selfish, egotistical and cowardly.

275
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:09,361
He can not see himself in the face
and stand for what he has done,

276
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:11,837
so he runs away.

277
00:40:13,608 --> 00:40:16,486
And leaves you all again
to take the consequences.

278
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:22,359
He risked your privileges,
which you have worked so hard for.

279
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:28,118
And where does he run to?

280
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:31,677
What will he find when
he finally stops running?

281
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,645
He will find nothing.

282
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:36,803
Nothing!

283
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:45,600
For he will be taken and sent right
back here. I can promise you that.

284
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,758
Am I disappointed?

285
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:51,195
Yes, I'm.

286
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:53,444
I disappointed in you.

287
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:56,121
I am disappointed in C-1 ,
Olav Fossen, 

288
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,118
whom is responsible for barracks C.

289
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:03,314
But those who really should
be disappointed, are you.

290
00:41:03,486 --> 00:41:05,602
Half rations.

291
00:41:30,726 --> 00:41:36,119
He did it.
He got away.

292
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,958
Erling escaped, for heavens sake!

293
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:42,118
I heard that the chef had talked
with the captain of the mail boat

294
00:41:42,285 --> 00:41:45,960
He said he had found the manager's
rowboat across the mountains -

295
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,480
- by Rørestrand.

296
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:54,319
...with an Our Father in covenant

297
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:59,156
if you never shudder

298
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:04,800
fight for everything you hold dear

299
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:09,961
die as it comes!

300
00:42:19,764 --> 00:42:21,243
C-5.

301
00:43:02,803 --> 00:43:04,759
The hero is back.

302
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,191
Come on, let's work.

303
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:59,357
C-1 will read this and then
carry out the punishment.

304
00:44:03,442 --> 00:44:04,955
Read.

305
00:44:08,241 --> 00:44:11,836
''Penalties for serious offenses
such as escape attempt, theft

306
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:13,514
or repeated use of tobacco,

307
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:19,551
shall receive 12 strokes to the
back or until the blood seems.''

308
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:23,997
Hands on the table!

309
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,235
Yes, between the lines.

310
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:37,439
Do it!

311
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:42,921
C-1, do it properly!

312
00:45:29,439 --> 00:45:33,068
Where are you going now?
Managers galley boy.

313
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:34,877
Don't blame me that you
broke the rules.

314
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:37,109
Was it easier for you to read me the
rules, than to tell the manager

315
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:41,113
what Bråthen does with Ivar
in the laundry room?

316
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:51,869
Or are the rules like that too?

317
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:54,348
You promised me, you devil!

318
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:07,356
Or do you dare not say anything, now that
you are about to get your signature?

319
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,671
What is going on?
What are you doing here?

320
00:47:14,836 --> 00:47:16,428
- House-father...
- Be quiet!

321
00:47:16,596 --> 00:47:18,109
You are so close to being released, 

322
00:47:18,276 --> 00:47:20,631
and you come running in here
without permission.

323
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,707
Have you lost your mind?

324
00:47:25,796 --> 00:47:28,071
I saw C-5 and...

325
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:30,993
...and...

326
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,984
...house-father Bråthen in...

327
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:37,545
Bråthen?
What is he doing?

328
00:47:37,716 --> 00:47:39,195
He puts C-5 in pain.

329
00:47:39,676 --> 00:47:41,428
Pain?

330
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,386
Well, speak up!

331
00:47:49,556 --> 00:47:51,750
House-father Bråthen

332
00:47:52,755 --> 00:47:54,507
and C-5...

333
00:47:55,555 --> 00:47:58,592
I saw them in the laundry cellar.

334
00:48:08,235 --> 00:48:14,105
What are you trying to say?
What are these hideous fantasies?

335
00:48:14,355 --> 00:48:18,189
It's not allowed! What he does 
with Ivar in the laundry cellar.

336
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:21,264
Get out!
Go!

337
00:48:42,354 --> 00:48:44,629
Ivar! I want you and I to go
to the manager right now.

338
00:48:44,794 --> 00:48:46,705
Do you not see that I'm working?

339
00:48:46,874 --> 00:48:51,152
If we go together, he will believe us.

340
00:48:51,994 --> 00:48:55,031
Then I'll never go home.

341
00:49:12,593 --> 00:49:14,788
C-5.

342
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:16,466
Bestyrer.

343
00:49:21,273 --> 00:49:22,911
Stand straight.

344
00:49:24,193 --> 00:49:26,912
I am just wondering

345
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,271
if your hand is better?

346
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:33,584
Yea, it's a little better.

347
00:49:34,073 --> 00:49:35,631
Thanks, manager.

348
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:38,626
Good. Then everything is okay.

349
00:49:40,073 --> 00:49:41,903
Excellent.

350
00:49:42,072 --> 00:49:43,505
Nothing to complain about.

351
00:49:47,312 --> 00:49:49,109
But there are no other problems?

352
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:50,864
No.

353
00:49:51,832 --> 00:49:55,188
No, because I thought you should maybe...

354
00:49:55,352 --> 00:49:57,741
I believe it will be better for you,
if you work in the forest 

355
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,664
with you friends.

356
00:49:59,832 --> 00:50:01,709
Thanks, manager.

357
00:50:02,192 --> 00:50:06,982
Yea, I believe that
the forest will better suit you.

358
00:50:07,632 --> 00:50:08,951
Yes, manager.

359
00:50:09,552 --> 00:50:12,942
Great, then!
Good.

360
00:50:38,671 --> 00:50:41,424
You owe me money.

361
00:50:41,591 --> 00:50:43,786
What money?

362
00:50:45,031 --> 00:50:48,944
Bråthen and I are having a bet.

363
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:54,908
If you are back in
laundry in the morning.

364
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:58,221
Go and help Bjarne with the fire.

365
00:51:41,189 --> 00:51:43,225
What are you doing with Ivar's clock?

366
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:45,345
He gave it to me.

367
00:53:18,147 --> 00:53:19,375
Get back!

368
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:26,302
Get the nurse now.
Right away!

369
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:28,943
Run!

370
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:36,141
Get them to the sleeping hall.

371
00:53:54,466 --> 00:53:56,536
To the sleeping hall.

372
00:54:01,426 --> 00:54:03,939
Go to the sleeping hall!

373
00:54:52,264 --> 00:54:56,018
It is absolutely terrible
what has happened.

374
00:54:56,184 --> 00:55:00,735
We suffer from everything that has
happened with the poor boy.

375
00:55:00,904 --> 00:55:04,260
I understand that you feel guilty.

376
00:55:09,824 --> 00:55:13,976
But I have to admit that he didn't
have it so easy before he came here.

377
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,419
And it was no less turbulent here.

378
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:19,653
He was not as strong.

379
00:55:20,143 --> 00:55:25,171
He was one of those whom did not
fit to live among other people.

380
00:55:25,343 --> 00:55:29,495
And maybe it was God's will
that he finally let go.

381
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:35,135
We tried to help him,
and find easy work for him.

382
00:55:36,063 --> 00:55:38,019
But,

383
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:41,456
he tried to swim away from here,

384
00:55:41,623 --> 00:55:47,141
a desperate act
that could only end in disaster.

385
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:51,421
And we all know where he
got the idea from to flee.

386
00:55:55,342 --> 00:55:57,936
Escape is just

387
00:55:58,102 --> 00:56:00,855
a childish fantasy.

388
00:56:02,582 --> 00:56:05,176
But he is in peace now.

389
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:07,902
He is in God's place.

390
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,212
Sit down.

391
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,209
C-19, sit down!

392
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:07,294
Send C-19 to my room.

393
00:58:10,899 --> 00:58:13,618
Are you looking to go to prison?

394
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:20,738
If you can't decide, then you
don't understand what a prison is.

395
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:23,896
He didn't try to escape.
He drowned himself.

396
00:58:24,098 --> 00:58:27,374
What's the difference? He's gone.
Forget him!

397
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:30,848
And help the others to forget him also.

398
00:58:31,218 --> 00:58:34,608
You've seen little of the world and you
think you understand. But you don't.

399
00:58:35,138 --> 00:58:38,972
No, manager,
there is a lot i don't understand.

400
00:58:39,378 --> 00:58:44,452
Bastøy or prison. The choice is yours.
Get him out.

401
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:10,930
Why have you been here so long,
Bråthen?

402
00:59:14,897 --> 00:59:16,933
They talk.

403
00:59:17,257 --> 00:59:20,932
There are rumors that I don't even
want to speak about. Accusations.

404
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:25,614
You can't listen to them,
they say whatever they want.

405
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:28,892
A child has died.

406
00:59:29,057 --> 00:59:33,926
And you have been accused of 
actions which are so horrible...

407
00:59:34,097 --> 00:59:36,326
the only thing I have done 

408
00:59:36,496 --> 00:59:39,488
is to try to help a boy
who could not help himself.

409
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,654
C-5 was not scared of me.

410
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:47,367
It was these animals
he lived with in barracks C.

411
00:59:48,256 --> 00:59:54,047
I can't have a house-father who is
suspected of such a thing as this.

412
00:59:56,656 --> 00:59:58,806
It's disgusting.

413
01:00:04,416 --> 01:00:06,247
Bestyrer.

414
01:00:07,336 --> 01:00:08,530
Please...

415
01:00:08,776 --> 01:00:14,486
You are accused of fornication with a child.
Do you understand what that means?

416
01:00:15,415 --> 01:00:17,485
Is there much truth there, 

417
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:21,330
shall I see that you rot away in
a prison for the rest of your life.

418
01:00:21,495 --> 01:00:27,445
I understand how difficult a man 
of your position must have it.

419
01:00:27,975 --> 01:00:30,443
With a young wife here.

420
01:00:31,135 --> 01:00:33,251
And all the responsibility.

421
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:35,770
And all these options to take.

422
01:00:35,935 --> 01:00:41,134
And the funds that would get the boys
and the island destroyed for good.

423
01:00:41,335 --> 01:00:46,489
The funds you've used up
to make your life a little easier.

424
01:00:46,655 --> 01:00:49,089
I know that.

425
01:00:50,095 --> 01:00:53,723
But others could maybe misunderstand it.

426
01:01:23,654 --> 01:01:26,168
Now you're leaving!
You bastard!

427
01:01:27,653 --> 01:01:30,326
Leave, you bastard!

428
01:01:41,853 --> 01:01:43,889
Now it's too late.

429
01:01:48,653 --> 01:01:53,204
What are you going to say when the committee comes?
When they begin to ask questions.

430
01:01:53,373 --> 01:01:57,571
They will certainly question and dig.

431
01:01:58,373 --> 01:02:00,170
You have to tell them the truth.

432
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:03,928
You don't give up, Astrid.
You don't give up.

433
01:02:19,092 --> 01:02:22,528
- Are you Erling Kaspersen?
- I am C-19, mam.

434
01:02:22,692 --> 01:02:25,081
Have you learned anything here?

435
01:02:26,092 --> 01:02:30,165
- Yes, mam, I have learned many things.
- Could you tell me what kind of things?

436
01:02:30,332 --> 01:02:32,402
I learned that I would rather
be here than in prison.

437
01:02:32,572 --> 01:02:34,403
And why is that?

438
01:02:35,412 --> 01:02:39,246
Don't you see
what great good we get, mam?

439
01:02:57,491 --> 01:02:59,402
The boys,
are they always so quiet at the table?

440
01:02:59,571 --> 01:03:01,050
No.

441
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:05,090
You see them now as they will be seen.
Clean and neat.

442
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:08,049
Especially the boys
who may be out in society.

443
01:03:08,211 --> 01:03:12,170
For them, this is more of great importance.

444
01:03:12,651 --> 01:03:17,850
The boy that died recently.
It must have made an impression on them?

445
01:03:18,011 --> 01:03:21,719
I'm the first to recognize that
it isn't easy being a Bastøy boy.

446
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,085
It's a brutal environment.

447
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:27,242
We do what we can.
We help and we support them.

448
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:30,083
But one can not
be everywhere all the time.

449
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:33,606
And children could be very bad.

450
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:38,609
The boy who tried to escape
turned out to be a chop chicken.

451
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:42,160
He was not strong enough
to take care of himself.

452
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:44,560
Yea, it is tragic.

453
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:49,969
''If we confess our sins,
He is faithful and just.''

454
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:56,967
''So, he forgive us our sins and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness.''

455
01:03:57,209 --> 01:04:01,441
''What hurts is when it is...''

456
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:21,641
''if we confess our sins,
he is faithful and just.''

457
01:04:21,809 --> 01:04:23,765
Nervous?

458
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:30,644
''So, he forgive us our sins and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness.''

459
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,525
Good.
Congratulations.

460
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:37,965
Do you have something you want to say to us?

461
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:43,156
You need not be afraid,
it is only just to speak out.

462
01:04:44,408 --> 01:04:47,081
Yes, I want

463
01:04:47,248 --> 01:04:50,445
to say something to Mr. Bestyrer.

464
01:04:56,168 --> 01:05:00,241
I will never forget all he has done.

465
01:05:02,128 --> 01:05:04,562
I want to say something.

466
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:08,758
There is a boy here who died on this island.

467
01:05:09,288 --> 01:05:11,164
I understand manager

468
01:05:11,327 --> 01:05:16,560
that you were not directly involved
in harassing this kid.

469
01:05:17,367 --> 01:05:23,317
But I'm speaking as a leader of hall C,
you had a responsibility.

470
01:05:24,447 --> 01:05:26,756
Do you understand that?

471
01:05:28,927 --> 01:05:33,239
Those were wise words, Fossen.

472
01:05:33,407 --> 01:05:36,877
You could have taken
better care of that boy.

473
01:05:37,047 --> 01:05:38,958
Yes, Bestyrer.

474
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:51,998
When do you leave?

475
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:54,043
In one week.

476
01:05:56,046 --> 01:05:58,480
What is it with you?

477
01:05:59,086 --> 01:06:01,554
You're going out in the world now.

478
01:06:02,606 --> 01:06:06,884
You can do what you want.
Get yourself a wife.

479
01:06:07,766 --> 01:06:11,122
Do you know what the committee said?
Do you know what the manager said about us?

480
01:06:11,486 --> 01:06:13,795
Doesn't matter what they said.

481
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:17,163
Bastøy is only a
small stone in the water.

482
01:06:23,766 --> 01:06:26,837
You can be what you want.

483
01:06:28,045 --> 01:06:32,835
You can be a priest,
you are so smart in reading rules.

484
01:06:41,685 --> 01:06:44,199
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

485
01:07:11,004 --> 01:07:14,235
''We sailed for several weeks
before we saw him again.''

486
01:07:14,404 --> 01:07:16,554
''Our food ran out.''

487
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:20,876
''And Øystein, the chef, was not so
much to brag about in the beginning.''

488
01:07:21,044 --> 01:07:26,835
''Should have seen how thing I've become.
I can't eat anymore fish.''

489
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:30,634
''But we found the whale again,
and we came right on top of it.''

490
01:07:30,804 --> 01:07:33,113
''Close than we had before.''

491
01:07:33,444 --> 01:07:37,323
''He was weaker due to the harpoon
I shot him with.''

492
01:07:37,484 --> 01:07:41,681
''At close range, he was great,
25 meters long at least.''

493
01:07:41,843 --> 01:07:44,721
''And covered with scars from
all the battles he had fought.''

494
01:07:45,243 --> 01:07:49,998
''He had already killed
the new deck boy.''

495
01:07:51,563 --> 01:07:55,351
''The Captain have a
high opinion of himself.''

496
01:07:55,763 --> 01:07:59,597
''But deep inside
he is a damned coward.''

497
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:04,957
''The rest of the crew
are afraid of him.''

498
01:08:06,523 --> 01:08:09,754
''I have become acquainted with
one boy whom is soon to sign off.''

499
01:08:09,923 --> 01:08:12,835
"For six years he has worn on the ship,
he has done everything right. "

500
01:08:13,003 --> 01:08:15,312
''Now he is going home."

501
01:08:25,682 --> 01:08:29,914
Forgive us our debts, who
also have forgiven our debtors.

502
01:08:30,082 --> 01:08:34,473
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

503
01:08:34,642 --> 01:08:39,557
For thine is the kingdom, and
power  and the glory forever. Amen

504
01:08:40,202 --> 01:08:41,840
Sit down.

505
01:08:46,162 --> 01:08:47,754
Sit down!

506
01:09:00,401 --> 01:09:05,236
We shall now take leave of
two friends. Two good friends.

507
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,439
By tomorrow they will be out in
the world meeting 

508
01:09:08,601 --> 01:09:12,640
new sorrows, new joys,
new lessons.

509
01:09:25,681 --> 01:09:28,070
Aksel Johnsen.

510
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:39,114
God bless you. And may you take
care of the opportunities he gives you.

511
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,872
Olav Fossen.

512
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,189
Go!

513
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,797
Olav Fossen.

514
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,479
Go.

515
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,951
Go while you can.

516
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,917
C-1?

517
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:24,677
Do you have any more wise words
that you want me to take with me?

518
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,755
Behave yourself, now.

519
01:11:03,918 --> 01:11:05,431
See you around.

520
01:11:25,237 --> 01:11:29,674
We never finished the story.

521
01:11:30,917 --> 01:11:35,035
Maybe I will see you again.
On a ship somewhere.

522
01:11:52,637 --> 01:11:55,105
I hear you guys are leaving

523
01:12:00,836 --> 01:12:02,554
Good luck.

524
01:12:05,396 --> 01:12:07,466
Good luck.

525
01:12:10,756 --> 01:12:13,828
C-1, towel.

526
01:12:38,075 --> 01:12:40,464
Did the manager know that
Bråthen is back?

527
01:12:40,635 --> 01:12:46,153
Of course he did. He had been
in land to shop for the manager.

528
01:15:38,991 --> 01:15:41,061
It's that simple.

529
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:43,222
If only you had done
that you were asked,

530
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:48,066
had it not been a problem.
Everything had been fine.

531
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:54,709
You damned liar!

532
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:07,905
Do you remember when you first came here?

533
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:11,181
A little brat 

534
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:17,266
who was so afraid that he shit on himself
and peed in his pants. Every day.

535
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:19,340
Worthless.

536
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:22,899
Just like the whore
of a mother you had.

537
01:16:23,069 --> 01:16:25,629
And your petty criminal father.

538
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,666
You were nothing.

539
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:30,544
For six years I have struggled with you.

540
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:33,507
And all that is of value to you,

541
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:36,024
I created.

542
01:17:09,228 --> 01:17:10,980
Bjarne!

543
01:17:11,148 --> 01:17:13,264
You must help us.

544
01:17:15,068 --> 01:17:16,899
You're one of us.

545
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:20,899
Bjarne?

546
01:17:21,188 --> 01:17:23,622
Bjarne, you are one of us!

547
01:18:13,986 --> 01:18:16,625
Øystein, eat your food.

548
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:22,180
Come on, Øystein, you must eat.

549
01:18:28,986 --> 01:18:30,704
Are you sleeping?

550
01:18:34,306 --> 01:18:38,265
Do it.
Or freeze up.

551
01:18:54,905 --> 01:18:57,578
There was just blood everywhere.

552
01:18:58,465 --> 01:19:01,377
He swallowed them down until he died.

553
01:19:01,545 --> 01:19:05,618
Harpoon shooter, cook and cabin boy.

554
01:19:08,025 --> 01:19:10,585
Everything, swallowed by the whale.

555
01:19:10,945 --> 01:19:14,779
And everything went back
the way it used to be.

556
01:19:14,945 --> 01:19:16,981
The captain was admiral.

557
01:19:17,145 --> 01:19:21,297
And could command a crap bowl.
And sailed to America.

558
01:19:21,625 --> 01:19:25,060
And the crew was on deck
and had their own number.

559
01:19:25,224 --> 01:19:28,102
Lined with mackerel and herring.

560
01:21:40,661 --> 01:21:42,777
Olav!

561
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:44,977
Take his key!

562
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:48,018
Help!

563
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:50,534
Help!

564
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,698
Runaway!

565
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:28,534
Olav!

566
01:22:31,779 --> 01:22:32,655
Olav!

567
01:22:32,819 --> 01:22:34,172
Olav!

568
01:22:36,779 --> 01:22:38,258
Runaway!

569
01:22:50,459 --> 01:22:52,893
Stop!
Enough!

570
01:22:54,899 --> 01:22:56,730
- Get up.
- Enough.

571
01:23:05,419 --> 01:23:07,489
Get up!

572
01:23:18,818 --> 01:23:21,332
Back to your places.

573
01:23:33,698 --> 01:23:35,336
Back to your places!

574
01:23:43,098 --> 01:23:44,928
Back!

575
01:24:38,376 --> 01:24:40,048
Come on!

576
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:29,528
Don't do anything dumb now, boys.

577
01:25:48,294 --> 01:25:52,492
What are you looking at?
Fucking Bastøy Boy.

578
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:42,369
Get up on the chair.

579
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,403
The manager is coming!

580
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:51,009
Let him through.

581
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:15,445
You do not belong here, either.

582
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,843
Goodbye, manager!

583
01:29:19,968 --> 01:29:21,560
Let him go!

584
01:29:39,048 --> 01:29:41,437
He said we should let him burn.

585
01:29:45,248 --> 01:29:46,727
Get out!

586
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,643
Get out!

587
01:29:58,207 --> 01:29:59,686
C-19.

588
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:04,001
Are you going to kill me now?

589
01:31:20,365 --> 01:31:22,276
So?

590
01:31:23,325 --> 01:31:26,237
Can I get your signature?

591
01:31:49,564 --> 01:31:51,361
Lieutenant?

592
01:31:52,404 --> 01:31:55,476
I have to talk to someone higher up.

593
01:31:59,004 --> 01:32:00,960
I want 

594
01:32:01,124 --> 01:32:04,002
to speak to the King of Norway.

595
01:32:11,164 --> 01:32:13,724
Tell him that it is...

596
01:32:19,044 --> 01:32:21,558
that is it the king of Bastøy.

597
01:32:33,283 --> 01:32:35,638
They're coming back!

598
01:32:35,803 --> 01:32:38,715
And there are many of them.

599
01:32:39,323 --> 01:32:42,440
Do you understand what I am saying, Olav?

600
01:32:59,403 --> 01:33:01,234
Take the paddles.

601
01:33:02,802 --> 01:33:04,030
Come on!

602
01:33:20,202 --> 01:33:22,033
Come on!

603
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,836
They’re coming.

604
01:38:05,034 --> 01:38:07,070
It came over from the mainland.

605
01:38:07,234 --> 01:38:10,385
- I can't do this anymore
- The sea is frozen over.

606
01:38:10,754 --> 01:38:12,870
I can't stand it.

607
01:38:14,234 --> 01:38:16,190
We can cross over!

608
01:38:16,354 --> 01:38:18,788
I can't go on it.

609
01:38:54,953 --> 01:38:56,432
Stop!

610
01:39:10,433 --> 01:39:12,310
Stop!

611
01:39:58,391 --> 01:39:59,790
Come on!

612
01:42:16,708 --> 01:42:19,904
The letters were to my sister.

613
01:42:38,147 --> 01:42:40,741
Let me go.
Let me go...

614
01:43:39,905 --> 01:43:41,384
Olav.

615
01:43:42,225 --> 01:43:43,499
Olav.

616
01:43:48,105 --> 01:43:49,618
Olav.

617
01:43:54,865 --> 01:43:57,937
Olav?
We are approaching Christiania.

618
01:43:58,825 --> 01:44:01,385
Bastøy, port.

619
01:44:18,024 --> 01:44:23,178
I once saw a whale swim
with three harpoons in it.

620
01:44:27,104 --> 01:44:30,176
It took the entire day to die.

621
01:44:30,704 --> 01:44:36,381
He was weaker due to the
harpoon I shot him with

622
01:44:36,784 --> 01:44:41,460
And covered with scars from
all the battles he had fought.

623
01:44:45,304 --> 01:44:48,181
I have become acquainted with
one boy whom is soon to sign off.

624
01:44:48,343 --> 01:44:52,097
For the six years he has been on
the ship, he has done everything right.

625
01:44:52,263 --> 01:44:55,494
And now, he is going home.
