1
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:06,731


2
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:09,876


3
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:13,691


4
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:34,195
- I cannot believe this.
- Why not?

5
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:37,782
Because I love you, Fabio, like a son.

6
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,895
And I love you, Don Luis, like a father.

7
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:45,225
I'm going to miss you.

8
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:48,718
And I'm going to miss you.

9
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,245
OK, enough of this sentimental bullshit.

10
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,985
One last drink?
Next, we'll be crying like two old women!

11
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,411
Come on.

12
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:02,312
To the future.

13
00:03:04,012 --> 00:03:06,105
<i>Good health and life!<i>

14
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:14,911
So, business is all clear?

15
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,670
It's all here.

16
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:26,627
- No other copies?
- You have to ask? -Hey!

17
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:29,436
Come on.

18
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,466
I'm going to miss you.

19
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,855
<i>Bye, Marco.<i>

20
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,108
Kill this motherfucker.

21
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,999
<i>I cannot believe this.<i>

22
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,548
Not okay, boss?

23
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,050
The bastard thinks I'm an idiot, playing it all mellow and shit.

24
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:12,878
If he would have yelled and screamed and threatened to kill my
whole family it would have been better.

25
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,483
We have about an hour to get outta here at the most!
<i>Let's go!<i>

26
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,999
We've got ten minutes.

27
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,629
- Cataleya, go pack.
- I'm packed Mamma.

28
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:11,819
Cataleya.

29
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:17,020
<i>Listen to me.<i>
In case anything happens...

30
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:20,616
this is your passport.

31
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:24,682
If you find yourself alone,
you go to this address on this card.

32
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:27,251
Show it to the man at the gate.

33
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:32,723
- I don't understand, Papa.
- You don't have to understand.

34
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:36,241
You just have to listen
and remember.

35
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:43,024
Take the bus and go here.

36
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:52,048
And this... this will keep you safe.

37
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:57,242
The cataleya orchid.
My mother, your grandmother...

38
00:05:57,243 --> 00:06:04,529
used to grow them - every morning
I'd wake up to the sight of them. The smell of them.

39
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,946
That's why I named you 'Cataleya'.

40
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:11,117
Never forget where you came from.

41
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:30,476
Hi. We want to see Don Fabio.

42
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,201
He's not home.

43
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:38,127
- I'm ready.
- <i>It's time! Come! Come!<i>

44
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,903
- Let's go!
- Come on.

45
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:50,060
Back, back, back.

46
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:58,649
They say he is not home yet.

47
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,887
Wait a minute.

48
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,200
It's too late.
Get ready.

49
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,126
I love you very much.

50
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,379
I love you too, Papa.

51
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,814
Do it now.

52
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,692
Change of plans.

53
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:11,576
Do you remember me, Cataleya?

54
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,726
I was at your confirmation.

55
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:19,391
My name is Marco
and I was a very good friend of your father.

56
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:24,882
You know who Don Luis is, right?

57
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:28,214
He was like a father to your father.

58
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,208
That makes you family too.

59
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:41,004
But when someone is
good to you...

60
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:45,047
and you're not good to them back,
then bad things happen.

61
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,354
You do very well in school, so I know this is not too
complicated for you to understand. Am I Right?

62
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,213
Excellent.

63
00:09:55,214 --> 00:10:02,203
Now, your father had something that belonged
to Don Luis. It's a small thing.

64
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:03,902
Not bigger than this.

65
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:06,378
Do you know where it is?

66
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,999
Well, if you give it to me,
Don Luis will be very happy and very grateful.

67
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,943
So, why don't you just give me that little thing
which belongs to him.

68
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,115
Would you do that?

69
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,270
You're a smart girl.

70
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:34,594
And in this life smart girls
always get what they want.

71
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:39,842
Just tell me, sweetheart...

72
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:42,001
What do you want?

73
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,288
To kill Don Luis!

74
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:56,677
Grab that little bitch.

75
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:06,032
We need her alive.

76
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:23,345
Find her! Find the little bitch.

77
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:22,466
Do not stop.

78
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:27,702
Got you.

79
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,769
Excuse me.

80
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:44,088
You said you - you have something for us, sweetie?

81
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,944
Well, may I see it?

82
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:36,243
OK, everybody, take a five-minute coffee break.

83
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:39,536
Jim, we're gonna have to record this.

84
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,526
- Where did you get this?
- My Papa.

85
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:48,633
Where is your Papa?

86
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,757
Dead.

87
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,809
Do you know what this is?

88
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,677
Yes.

89
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:57,958
My passport.

90
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:06,741
We're about to arrive in Miami.

91
00:16:08,351 --> 00:16:09,807
I'll buckle you up.

92
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,399
Welcome to America.

93
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:38,313
Go ahead, I'll wait right here.

94
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:12,436
Hello, young lady, where are we wanting
to go today?

95
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:18,735
Chicago? That's not just down the street, you know?

96
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:21,599
How much?

97
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:19,532
Hey, kid, what are you doing here?

98
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,487
Emilio.

99
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,782
There's a girl looking for you.

100
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:59,038
It does not matter.

101
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,139
Her name is Cataleya.

102
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:35,322
- Cataleya...
- Tio?

103
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:09,582
I thought you were dead.

104
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,823
You're safe.

105
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:22,703
It's OK.
You're safe now.

106
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:25,141
You're safe.

107
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:12,803
You have your mother's beautiful eyes.

108
00:21:14,535 --> 00:21:16,452
Don't be afraid.

109
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,687
This is your home.

110
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:29,294
How long has it been since you sleep?

111
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:34,068
I don't know. A long time ago.

112
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,057
Well, good. A young body needs to sleep.

113
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:40,003
When I was your age,
I would sleep half the day.

114
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:45,357
I do not know if it helps with your growing pattern,
but I was always ready for what came after.

115
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:51,866
Whose room did I sleep in?

116
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:55,622
My son.

117
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:57,998
Your cousin.

118
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,054
Where is he?

119
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:05,594
He's dead.

120
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,175
Killed?

121
00:22:12,102 --> 00:22:13,597
Yes.

122
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:16,039
By whom?

123
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:19,900
No one who is still alive.

124
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:25,825
You are very talented.

125
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:30,656
- Is this what you want to be, an artist?
- I used to want to be like Xena.

126
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:33,376
A Warrior Princess.

127
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,237
Not any more?

128
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:40,894
No?

129
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,440
I want to be a killer.

130
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:51,088
Can you help?

131
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,436
Sure.

132
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:16,215
Normally we don't accept students
in the middle of the academic year.

133
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:23,420
But under these circumstances,
losing her parents in a tragic car accident.

134
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:29,269
- Here you are. These are the school supplies you'll need.
- Sorry...

135
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,311
She's a little traumatized.

136
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:32,721
Of course.

137
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:34,678
See you Monday, Cataleya.

138
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:37,564
Such a pretty name.

139
00:23:40,424 --> 00:23:42,290
Thanks.

140
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:53,317
After we get all this stuff, we go over
to Maxwell Street to get hot dogs from those Polish people here.

141
00:23:57,611 --> 00:23:59,056
What is it now?

142
00:23:59,448 --> 00:24:01,903
That school has nothing to teach me.

143
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,683
I told you what I want.

144
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:09,008
You don't want to help me? Fine.

145
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:11,168
I'll do it myself.

146
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:15,773
Look.

147
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:35,055
See that? Is that what you want? You want me to
teach you how to be a killer? Sure, no problema, I teach you.

148
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,851
But you'll be dead in five years.

149
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,986
If you want to be a killer and survive,
you got to be a smart one.

150
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:48,891
You have to know things besides
how to pull a trigger.

151
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:51,271
You have to know how the world works,
how people think...

152
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:56,956
You gotta learn how to stand, how to be psychological.
And I cannot teach you that unless you learn the basics out of school.

153
00:24:56,957 --> 00:24:59,252
You got that? Hmm?

154
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:03,052
Come on. What's it going to be?
Cataleya? You choose.

155
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:04,699
Come on.

156
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:08,189
Now. Choose.

157
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,573
What you want? Choose.

158
00:25:20,493 --> 00:25:22,601
Better.

159
00:25:47,457 --> 00:25:50,471
Hey, buddy.
I got the good stuff.

160
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:54,224
- So, might I suggest... -Yeah?
- Let's buy some things. You know,.

161
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:56,993
Spice it up a bit.

162
00:25:57,027 --> 00:25:59,969
- Some of those stockings that come up to the thigh.
- Right, nice.

163
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:04,157
- It's been fourteen years, you know what I mean?
- No matter how much you like steak...

164
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:08,517
- sometimes a lamb chop isn't a bad thing, right?
- Exactly.

165
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:17,193
Son of a bitch!

166
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:31,170
- Put your hands on the car!
- Hands on the vehicle, right now!

167
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:33,651
Oooh, back...

168
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:42,021
- Stupid, crazy bitch.
- I'm really sorry. This is not - it's not even my car.

169
00:26:42,055 --> 00:26:44,745
- You think this is funny?
- No, sir!

170
00:26:46,475 --> 00:26:49,484
I'm gonna give you something to laugh about.

171
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:53,420
I'm sorry, officer.
I'm sorry, I don't drink...

172
00:27:15,637 --> 00:27:17,406
There's nothing here.

173
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:23,810
No license, no registration, No ID...

174
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:27,032
except for a library card.

175
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:31,045
Miss Valerie Philips.

176
00:27:31,078 --> 00:27:37,623
In addition to all that, you are being charged
with DUI, driving on the wrong side of the road

177
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,356
and the destruction of police property.

178
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:43,532
Miss Philips!

179
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:46,798
Do I have your full attention?

180
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:52,295
Yeah. That's it?

181
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,179
Unless there's anything else you can think of?

182
00:27:56,711 --> 00:28:00,904
- I have to throw up.
- Oh, no, no, no. Get her out of here.

183
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:07,148
And a cup of coffee too. We can book her tomorrow.
Let her sleep it off, for Christ's sake...

184
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:18,602
Alright, big step. Down you come.

185
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,674
Alright, stretch those legs. Come on, move!

186
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,303
McGee just checked downstairs.

187
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,675
She's from Rome, OK, and she says to the other...

188
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,503
Excuse me. U.S. Marshall Warren.

189
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:36,405
- We're here with Gennaro Rizzo on an overnight.
- Wait, wait, wait - hold on a second.

190
00:28:36,768 --> 00:28:39,382
You know, it says here that you aren't expected
until tomorrow

191
00:28:39,434 --> 00:28:43,824
Yeah, well, never expect the expected, sergeant.
Is that coffee there? Is that fresh?

192
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:45,291
- Yes, it is.
- Do you mind?

193
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:47,563
- Uh, Fred?
- Thanks.

194
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,999
Agent Doyle is gonna show you where
the cell blocks are.

195
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,281
Oh, come on.

196
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,074
Home, sweet home.

197
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:01,835
After you, sir.

198
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:12,825
I'm going to miss you, Rizzo.

199
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:16,237
I gonna leave that just there,
just in case you get hungry in the night.

200
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:19,903
Sleep well.

201
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:23,515
This'll be a caffeine kinda night, Joe.
Keep your eyes open.

202
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:04,411
Two...

203
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:06,441
Three...

204
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,263
Not again.

205
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:17,880
Hey, Doyle, go check on the ventilation system, will ya?
As in today, please?

206
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:18,658
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I gotta pee...?

207
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:28,379
- Unbutton your shirt.
- What? -Now.

208
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:34,479
Who are you?

209
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:42,992
Go! Come on!

210
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,687
We have a security threat.

211
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:48,952
Come!

212
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:52,459
Get inside.
Somebody open the fucking door!

213
00:35:00,553 --> 00:35:03,454
Look at me, Joe, look at me. Give me the gun.

214
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:05,881
Just give it to me, OK. It's good.

215
00:35:07,278 --> 00:35:10,719
- Hold on, hold on.
- I didn't do it.

216
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,222
I didn't do it!

217
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:17,846
- Get him out of here.
- I didn't do it!

218
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,187
Call it in. Call it in!

219
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:25,935


220
00:35:34,118 --> 00:35:35,760


221
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:44,656


222
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:16,604
Damn.

223
00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:35,989
Check on the other side.

224
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:41,238
It's clear here.

225
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,836
I'm outta here.

226
00:37:25,562 --> 00:37:27,462
Agent Ross.

227
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:30,253
- Where is he?
- He's in the morgue.

228
00:37:30,254 --> 00:37:31,774
Let's go.

229
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:40,417
This is just how he came in.

230
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:45,523
It's the same handwriting.

231
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:51,023
Same drawing, right?

232
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:53,183
That's him.

233
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,661
I want to see the location, please.

234
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:58,808
Thank you.

235
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:04,578
- Oh, I shouldn't drink.
- No, you shouldn't.

236
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:09,659
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, you can tell that to the Judge in ten days' time, at your hearing.

237
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:17,853
- What's going on down there?
- Nothing. You can sign this form, and then you can go.

238
00:38:17,854 --> 00:38:21,591
- Really?
- Yeah, really, but I'm quite sure the judge will send you back here.

239
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:24,922
- I'd probably deserve it.
- Oh, you're just lucky no one got hurt.

240
00:38:31,947 --> 00:38:33,328
Okay, now, back up.

241
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:44,447
- You're gonna have to lock it down.
- Hey, it was after the fact, I didn't think anybody would...

242
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:47,604
You gotta do it, all right? Nobody in, nobody out, please.

243
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:53,566
You heard that man. Lock it down.
Nobody in or nobody out.

244
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:34,166
I want to paper, on everybody in or out of this
station in the last 24 hours.

245
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:39,698
And I want the tapes.

246
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:42,060
From all the security cameras.

247
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:43,901
All of them.

248
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,720
- <i>Is everything okay?<i>
- We're good.

249
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,877
- When you are back?
- The day after tomorrow.

250
00:40:34,878 --> 00:40:37,187
Well, I have something for you.

251
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:40,579
Give me a day.

252
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,781
We can't wait to see you.

253
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:46,367
- Give mama a kiss for me.
- I will.

254
00:40:52,602 --> 00:40:56,418
Twenty-two murders in the last four years
all with the same MO.

255
00:40:56,419 --> 00:41:00,783
I think I'm right, he is sending a message
but I'm beginning to believe it's not meant for us.

256
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:04,824
- Well, we're the only ones with that information.
- Well, we're not getting anywhere with it, are we?

257
00:41:04,825 --> 00:41:07,758
Put it out to the press.
It's time.

258
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:16,388
The word, this lipstick drawing, I want it splashed over
every newspaper, every magazine, front page, national.

259
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:20,194
The message ain't meant for us.
Let's make sure it gets to who it's intended for.

260
00:41:34,293 --> 00:41:36,230
Mr. Richard.

261
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,048
- Marco.
- It's been a long time.

262
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:41,279
Yes, it has. How is the hand?

263
00:41:41,314 --> 00:41:43,932
It only hurts when it's humid.

264
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:46,920
Well, you should have let us relocate you to Arizona
instead of New Orleans.

265
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,176
Yeah, right, but the boss likes it humid.

266
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:52,166
He's waiting for you.

267
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:57,088
What do you think?

268
00:41:58,711 --> 00:42:01,660
- Coincidence.
- Twenty-two times?

269
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:04,755
A flower that only grows in one place on earth?

270
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:09,287
Couldn't it be the calling card of... shoot,
I forgot his name.

271
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:13,286
What his name, your former partner,
you know, the one who used to do your wetwork?

272
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:16,888
Fabio.

273
00:42:17,386 --> 00:42:19,540
Fabio Restrepo.

274
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,009
May I?

275
00:42:22,722 --> 00:42:26,087
The CIA is not an amusement park.

276
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:31,306
When the agency extracted your ass from
Colombia 15 years ago

277
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:36,590
and set you up here, we allowed you to resume you
little business, but what we should've done was lock you away for life.

278
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:40,199
Now, in exchange, you should've kept the information flowing.

279
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,600
- And I have.
- Not much.

280
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:47,849
- I have nothing to do with this.
- Then find out who did.

281
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,514
She's talking to us.

282
00:43:05,441 --> 00:43:07,150
Could be anyone.

283
00:43:07,806 --> 00:43:13,076
You idiot. I told you,
everyone dead, down to the dog.

284
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,323
You screwed it up the first time.

285
00:43:17,324 --> 00:43:20,264
Now, go fix it.

286
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:18,123
Each and every one of the victims was
a professional bad apple.

287
00:45:18,124 --> 00:45:23,099
As for motive, I'm narrowing it down to payback.
But, um, not much else.

288
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:31,589
My best guess, Alexa Milshinova, she made a career out of
getting intimate with high stake gamblers out of Vegas.

289
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:35,127
Would, uh, rip 'em off and send them to meet
their maker.

290
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:37,945
Here. D'Angelo James.

291
00:45:37,946 --> 00:45:41,192
He tried to take over the heroin trade
of Houston

292
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,843
From the, uh, Gemini Cartel.

293
00:45:44,844 --> 00:45:48,957
If you do not all there is to know
about these twins...

294
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:51,508
you should not be in this room.

295
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:57,689
Now you see, he tilts the camera just enough,
so he won't be seen going into the cell.

296
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,373
The Time:
1:55 AM

297
00:46:00,374 --> 00:46:04,032
That means that our perp was in that station, that...

298
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:06,655
I don't have to spell it out for you, do I?

299
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:11,156
Excuse me.
Hand these out, please.

300
00:46:11,437 --> 00:46:14,956
These are the names, addresses and
phone numbers of everyone...

301
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:20,187
with a pulse who was in that station before
1:55 AM.

302
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:24,350
Everyone.
Which means one of them was our target.

303
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:27,814
I want you to locate the ten people in the folder
you have just been handed.

304
00:46:27,914 --> 00:46:32,572
I want a detailed dossier
on each of them for the last ten years of their lives.

305
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:36,755
I want you to run down every lead, check every story.

306
00:46:36,756 --> 00:46:39,333
Coz our killer, ladies and gentleman, is in those folders

307
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:43,206
and I mean to catch him before he
kills again.

308
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:14,998
Don't move.

309
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:20,241
Hello, Jennifer.

310
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:22,959
Hi, Danny.

311
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:36,552
You haven't finished painting.

312
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:39,456
Never really finished painting, I just stopped
working on it.

313
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:42,822
I know about something that you're
good at finishing.

314
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:53,170
Tell me something.

315
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:57,633
- Are we ever gonna go on a normal date together?
- What's a normal date?

316
00:47:57,634 --> 00:48:01,260
Well, you know. Go out, have dinner, drink wine,
get drunk.

317
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:03,768
Dessert?

318
00:49:20,492 --> 00:49:25,634
- Safe?
- From my end. And you?

319
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:28,874
- Safe.
- How's Mama?

320
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:34,577
- She is missing you.
- Well, tell her I miss her back.

321
00:49:34,578 --> 00:49:39,586
- I think she would love to hear that from you.
- I know.

322
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:42,595
What do we got?

323
00:49:44,646 --> 00:49:48,700
Remember the guy on the new for running
a Ponzi scheme about a year ago?

324
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:53,121
Made $50 million and vanished into thin air.
Clever guy.

325
00:49:53,122 --> 00:49:57,376
Now he's living in the Caribbean.

326
00:49:57,377 --> 00:50:03,003
So, he left a lot of people very upset.
Want to give him a break, permanently.

327
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:11,304
There is something else.

328
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:18,649
How long has this been going on?

329
00:50:22,382 --> 00:50:26,880
- Not long.
- The newspaper says, 22.

330
00:50:26,881 --> 00:50:30,269
- Why?
- You know why.

331
00:50:30,304 --> 00:50:33,392
You think this is going to smoke Don Luis out?
You think he's that stupid?

332
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:36,963
It's not just about you, OK? Cataleya?

333
00:50:37,063 --> 00:50:39,097
There's me, Mama, and my family.

334
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:43,367
Familia? Tio, please.

335
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:47,687
You're clean. You book the work,
you collect the money...

336
00:50:47,688 --> 00:50:50,964
I'll protect you.

337
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:55,422
Each and every job, I make a dollar with, if I give you a job,

338
00:50:55,423 --> 00:50:59,458
I turn down five, ten, because I made a promise
to keep you safe.

339
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:05,134
I'll keep you safe.
Cataleya, that is a full-time job, no matter what you think.

340
00:51:05,169 --> 00:51:08,057
But this is not a professional, it's not what I do...

341
00:51:08,058 --> 00:51:11,780
I don't care, about what's professional and what's safe.
I'm doing this my way.

342
00:51:11,781 --> 00:51:15,652
- That is your way?
- Yeah.

343
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:19,523
A dead killer, is stupid.

344
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:30,139
I should never have let you do this.

345
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:36,419
You didn't let me do anything.
I chose this, remember? I chose this...

346
00:51:36,906 --> 00:51:42,680
- From the first moment I walked in your door, I had
already made my decision. -By yourself? -Yes.

347
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:48,380
Not you, or anybody, are gonna change that.

348
00:51:51,962 --> 00:51:55,055
We love you, Cataleya.

349
00:51:59,429 --> 00:52:03,029
Then watch my back until it's done.

350
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:21,195
- Excuse me?
- It's an orchid.

351
00:52:21,395 --> 00:52:23,538
- That's what this is?
- Sure does.

352
00:52:23,638 --> 00:52:25,985
- It grows in Colombia.
- How do you know that?

353
00:52:26,085 --> 00:52:29,046
My wife, she's Colombian.

354
00:52:31,076 --> 00:52:33,854
- Uh, Cataleya?
- That's right.

355
00:52:44,112 --> 00:52:46,384
AMAZON

356
00:52:46,847 --> 00:52:49,723
Let's try 'organization'...

357
00:52:49,823 --> 00:52:52,926
ACCESS DENIED

358
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:03,321
Hi, boys.
Did you miss me?

359
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:07,138
I've missed you too.

360
00:53:08,214 --> 00:53:10,810
Hi. Come.

361
00:53:11,336 --> 00:53:14,328
Have you guys been good?

362
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:16,426
Stay.

363
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:20,140
Sirloin.
Juicy.

364
00:53:20,141 --> 00:53:23,735
Delicious.
Want one?

365
00:53:23,736 --> 00:53:26,225
Good.

366
00:53:32,274 --> 00:53:34,476
Eat.

367
00:53:41,784 --> 00:53:46,118
I know that song.

368
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:50,024
- I guess the boys gave me away, huh?
- You spoil them.

369
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:52,925
I train them.

370
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:21,719
Fishie, fishie...
Willy, why are they ignoring me?

371
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:27,946
- What?
- Baby, you put one drop of blood in there...

372
00:54:27,947 --> 00:54:31,260
- and they'll be your biggest admirers.
- Really?

373
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:35,916
Oh yeah, baby. All the way down to your
clean, stripped bones.

374
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:38,954
Cool.

375
00:54:43,507 --> 00:54:46,933
Alejandro, you bring in extra security for tonight.

376
00:54:46,934 --> 00:54:51,380
- Make sure that we are shut down. Tight.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:54:56,745 --> 00:55:00,261
Girls, come to papa, huh?

378
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:15,628
There are already guys in the garden
and guys out back.

379
00:55:15,629 --> 00:55:18,456
- I want you three upstairs.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:55:18,457 --> 00:55:20,878
Two on the roof.

381
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,980
Hurry.

382
00:56:41,154 --> 00:56:43,965
What is this?

383
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:58,034
Come back to bed.

384
00:58:01,128 --> 00:58:04,303
Turn around.

385
00:58:13,634 --> 00:58:16,417
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter who I am.

386
00:58:21,883 --> 00:58:26,136
- OK. What do you want?
- I want you exactly where you are.

387
00:58:32,736 --> 00:58:35,924
Whatever they pay, I'll double it.

388
00:58:35,925 --> 00:58:39,215
- Please don't kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you.

389
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:46,259
No, please.

390
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:11,522
SHARKS EAT "SHARK".

391
00:59:15,121 --> 00:59:17,129
- Mr. Steven Richard?
- Who is this?

392
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,464
This is FBI special agent James Ross.

393
00:59:19,465 --> 00:59:24,875
Look, I'm the lead agent on a case, it's a serial
we call the tag killer. You might have heard of him?

394
00:59:25,868 --> 00:59:29,553
- I've seen the possiblity.
- He mocks his victims with a flower.

395
00:59:29,554 --> 00:59:32,888
It's from Colombia.
A cataleya orchid.

396
00:59:32,889 --> 00:59:38,289
Each time I try access information
I get stuck with a CIA "Access Denied" tag...

397
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:43,137
I'm at the end of a very long road, Mr. Richard,
and I believe that you are the man I need...

398
00:59:43,138 --> 00:59:47,703
Listen, Agent Ross, I can't give any information out on the phone,


399
00:59:47,704 --> 00:59:51,520
but what I suggest is that you file a formal request with the agency
for any information you might want.

400
00:59:51,616 --> 00:59:55,922
And I'll be more than happy to get back to you as soon as I can.

401
00:59:58,632 --> 01:00:01,039
Thank you.

402
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:16,001
Stop bullshitting me, Marco.
I've got the FBI on my ass now.

403
01:00:16,036 --> 01:00:19,323
I want that problem taken care of yesterday,
do you hear me?

404
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,133
- Loud and clear.
- Good.

405
01:00:28,677 --> 01:00:30,635
- Where to?
- Downtown.

406
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,512
And we question every Colombian we meet...

407
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:37,761
until we find an address to get her family. OK?

408
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:08,104
<i>In case you show up, I want you to know
I went to New York to meet with galleries.</i>

409
01:01:08,105 --> 01:01:13,948
<i>I'll be back tomorrow night, but
if you're already here, make yourself at home.</i>

410
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:44,629
- What've we got?
- We do have the surveillance tapes from a few angles.

411
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,426
- That's it?
- That's it.

412
01:01:51,427 --> 01:01:54,863
- I mean, it's not a lot to go on... -Oh, come on...
- but run it through the database, see what happens.

413
01:02:08,801 --> 01:02:12,570
We're not looking for a woman.
It's not possible.

414
01:02:33,035 --> 01:02:35,854
- And wine.
- Thank you.

415
01:02:38,574 --> 01:02:40,831
- Come on.
- I'm impressed.

416
01:02:45,509 --> 01:02:46,961
I got you something.

417
01:02:47,061 --> 01:02:49,926
- You did?
- Yeah.

418
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:57,657
- A stuffed alligator?
- Yeah. -Exactly what I've always wanted.

419
01:03:04,236 --> 01:03:06,668
Wait, wait.

420
01:03:07,616 --> 01:03:13,546
Let's just, uh, let's just sit, have a little of this food and
then we'll talk for a little bit first.

421
01:03:14,603 --> 01:03:17,871
What do you want to talk about?

422
01:03:18,457 --> 01:03:22,247
I don't know.
Anything. Ask me something.

423
01:03:24,651 --> 01:03:26,979
- How was your trip?
- Actually it was great.

424
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:30,171
The gallery liked my new paintings,
they're gonna put up a show in October.

425
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:33,314
- And that's a good thing, right?
- Yeah.

426
01:03:33,479 --> 01:03:36,455
My turn. How was your trip?

427
01:03:38,963 --> 01:03:42,587
- Hot.
- Did you do anything exciting?

428
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:45,498
- I went swimming.
- Anything else?

429
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:52,256
- Come on. Talk to me.
- What do you want to know?

430
01:03:52,257 --> 01:03:56,892
Anything. Something about you. Something

431
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,885
Where are you from?

432
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:04,578
Are your parents from here in the city?

433
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:15,174
Let's start with something a little more simple.
What do you like to eat for breakfast?

434
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:18,162
I don't eat breakfast.

435
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:20,818
I'm not going to hurt you.

436
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:25,857
I just want to know a little bit more about you.
About what you feel inside. What you feel about me, anything.

437
01:04:25,858 --> 01:04:28,676
Just a little.

438
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:41,944
I feel lonely sometimes.

439
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:47,638
Thank you. Me too.

440
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,265
Let me this time.

441
01:05:55,569 --> 01:05:58,174
Morning.

442
01:05:59,503 --> 01:06:03,263
I know you said you don't eat breakfast,
so I thought I'd make us some lunch.

443
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:07,888
- Wait. Where you going?
- I shouldn't have done this.

444
01:06:07,889 --> 01:06:10,265
- Shouldn't have done what?
- Any of it.

445
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:13,414
I don't understand. Why?
What are you talking about? Why?

446
01:06:13,415 --> 01:06:17,156
- Because...
- Because...? Look, can we just hold on a second?
Can we Just talk about this?

447
01:06:17,157 --> 01:06:20,106
No, no, Danny.
We've talked too much.

448
01:06:20,107 --> 01:06:23,132
- Jennifer, just stay for a minute.
- I'm sorry. I have to go.

449
01:06:37,024 --> 01:06:39,319
I'm sorry I'm late.

450
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:42,033
<i>Look!<i>

451
01:06:43,622 --> 01:06:47,145
Eight people, slaughtered in Miami.
One of them is my friend.

452
01:06:47,966 --> 01:06:50,432
- So what?
- You know exactly what.

453
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:54,238
- It's getting too close.
- Ay, Tio, please. Again, with that?

454
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:57,183
They are looking for you.
Don't play with me.

455
01:06:58,968 --> 01:07:03,052
You'll bring me in for sure.
I know how your twisted little mind works.

456
01:07:03,957 --> 01:07:07,318
Do you think this is a game?
I'm a fucking joke to you?

457
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:14,369
You scare me, Cataleya.

458
01:07:14,404 --> 01:07:17,204
I won't deal with your shit anymore.

459
01:07:17,205 --> 01:07:19,857
I won't give you work, or anything, anymore.

460
01:07:21,044 --> 01:07:23,757
You're retired.

461
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:26,634
- You can't do that.
- <i>Quiet!<i>

462
01:07:27,177 --> 01:07:30,357
How many people did you kill when
your boy died?

463
01:07:32,959 --> 01:07:37,738
- <i>How much?<i>
- What you know my son?

464
01:07:37,773 --> 01:07:40,555
You don't know fucking nothing about my son.

465
01:07:43,986 --> 01:07:46,504
But it changed nothing.

466
01:07:47,018 --> 01:07:50,041
When I lose my son,
I lose my life.

467
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:52,351
Everything is important to me,
is gone.

468
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,650
And I want to believe in you, Cataleya.

469
01:07:56,251 --> 01:08:01,500
Why? I still pray that you
find a life, away from this.

470
01:08:01,533 --> 01:08:11,356
Because no one in our entire family
has a chance for one.

471
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:15,319
Listen. Never come to the house,
never come to the church.

472
01:08:15,354 --> 01:08:19,229
Don't bother. I don't wanna wait
for your phone call no more.

473
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:22,927
I don't want you to break my mother's heart.

474
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:27,175
Maybe this will help you to understand

475
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:30,452
what I'm trying to tell you.

476
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:01,829
5' 6". Brown eyes.
Well, hazel, actually.

477
01:09:02,302 --> 01:09:05,635
Dark hair.
Thick, shiny.

478
01:09:05,636 --> 01:09:07,835
Incredible body.
Killer smile.

479
01:09:07,836 --> 01:09:11,882
- I think about her all day long.
- Dude, you're in love.

480
01:09:12,419 --> 01:09:16,713
- You're so smart.
- Okay, seriously, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart,

481
01:09:17,202 --> 01:09:20,858
- you're nuts.
- I haven't had anyone important in my life for at least ten years.

482
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:25,455
I finally find someone that I really, really like,
that I want to be with all the time.

483
01:09:25,456 --> 01:09:28,328
I've got nothing.
I've got a stuffed animal and a picture.

484
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:32,752
You got a picture? Give it up.

485
01:09:32,753 --> 01:09:36,054
It's not even really a whole picture.
I took of her while she was sleeping, so...

486
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:42,051
- Relax.
- When do I get to meet the future Mrs. Delanay?

487
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:44,209
You? Never.

488
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:50,905
Excuse me, excuse me, why are you writing a ticket...?

489
01:09:58,565 --> 01:10:02,640
- Third Precinct.
- You got that picture?

490
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,528
Hello, skinny face, lying on my computer.

491
01:10:06,529 --> 01:10:10,294
Oooh, she is beautiful.
Clearly out of your league.

492
01:10:10,295 --> 01:10:14,514
It's not for me, it's for Danny.
Remember, the painter?

493
01:10:14,515 --> 01:10:17,710
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Much better match.
- It's a perfect match. How long is this going to take?

494
01:10:17,711 --> 01:10:20,922
- Slow down, tiger. You're my brother-in-law,
not my boss.

495
01:10:20,923 --> 01:10:22,912
And besides, I'm not supposed to be doing this.

496
01:10:22,913 --> 01:10:27,962
You are going to be the fairy godmother
in the most beautiful love story ever.

497
01:10:27,963 --> 01:10:32,851
You get the honor of saying you were the one.
Who made this all happen.

498
01:10:32,852 --> 01:10:35,857
And I get to lose my job
if I get caught.

499
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,481
Brian, it's done.
I'll call you when I got something, OK?

500
01:10:42,503 --> 01:10:44,817
Thank you, baby.

501
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:53,721
You'll thank me later.

502
01:11:00,053 --> 01:11:02,336
NEW ELEMENT

503
01:11:04,607 --> 01:11:07,900
Hey, I want a trace put on an incoming transmission.

504
01:11:22,844 --> 01:11:25,971
Chicago, third precinct.
Get somebody down there now.

505
01:12:10,308 --> 01:12:13,656
That was such a nice surprise.

506
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:18,598
- Everyone grows up sometime.
- She's gonna be okay.

507
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:22,788
Yes, Mama.
I think so.

508
01:12:40,942 --> 01:12:43,154
- Uh, excuse me?
- Come with me, please.

509
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:46,496
That's my computer! Why is she...
why are you all up on my computer?

510
01:12:46,511 --> 01:12:48,708
- You have to right to remain -
- You better not mess up My Favorites!

511
01:12:49,274 --> 01:12:53,042
We had a common, sir... Let's try size...

512
01:12:53,043 --> 01:12:56,259
Good. Now, let's see hands.

513
01:12:56,260 --> 01:13:01,546
Looking good. Now...

514
01:13:03,968 --> 01:13:06,435
Nice nose.

515
01:13:06,436 --> 01:13:09,165
Congratulations.
You have a girl.

516
01:13:09,874 --> 01:13:12,728
Print it.
Get 'em out to all stations.

517
01:13:13,196 --> 01:13:16,112
- And get the mobile unit ready.
- Yes, sir.

518
01:13:44,798 --> 01:13:47,275
- It's me.
- Jen?

519
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:49,694
Are you busy?

520
01:13:49,783 --> 01:13:52,732
No, no I'm not.

521
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:59,367
- Positioning in progress...
- I was just looking out the window and thinking,

522
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:03,090
- where are you?
- I'm, I'm at home. I was looking out the window too.

523
01:14:03,091 --> 01:14:05,643
So we're looking at the same star right now, huh?

524
01:14:05,644 --> 01:14:08,050
- Almost there.
- You have a sexy voice on the phone.

525
01:14:08,051 --> 01:14:11,916
- Yeah, you do too.
- We've got it.

526
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:15,151
OK, we've got. Give SWAT the location.

527
01:14:15,947 --> 01:14:18,358
Go!

528
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:22,883
- I'm really glad you called me.
- Me too.

529
01:14:22,884 --> 01:14:26,604
I was literally just looking a picture of you,
thinking of you, when the phone rang.

530
01:14:26,605 --> 01:14:29,229
- What picture?
- I took a picture of you while you were sleeping
with my phone.

531
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:32,961
It's really bad, but I really wanted
to have something to remind me of you.

532
01:14:33,858 --> 01:14:38,236
- Did you show it to anybody, Danny?
- No - well actually, to my friend Ryan.

533
01:14:38,237 --> 01:14:41,053
- Who else saw the picture, Danny?
- Nobody. Why?

534
01:14:43,038 --> 01:14:46,081
- Danny, who else?
- Nobody. I didn't show it anybody, what's the big deal?

535
01:14:52,623 --> 01:14:55,475
Look, I just took a stupid picture of you
with my phone. I'm sorry.

536
01:14:55,476 --> 01:14:58,188
I'm sorry too.

537
01:15:15,872 --> 01:15:19,831
- Let's see what we got
- Special Agent Williams, FBI.

538
01:15:23,725 --> 01:15:26,095
It's clear.

539
01:16:16,413 --> 01:16:21,295
No, ma'am, everything's under control. I just need
you to come with us, we're evacuating the building.

540
01:16:35,273 --> 01:16:37,820
Charges.

541
01:16:57,266 --> 01:16:59,465
Blow it.

542
01:17:32,075 --> 01:17:37,185
She's not here.
Lock down this building. ASAP.

543
01:18:05,587 --> 01:18:07,875
- Anything?
- Naw, nothing.

544
01:18:10,777 --> 01:18:13,065
No, wait, wait, wait, a security camera went down.

545
01:18:14,513 --> 01:18:16,631
- A second one down. -Where?
- The garage!

546
01:18:16,632 --> 01:18:18,970
- All units, get to the garage.
- Let's go, let's go!

547
01:18:18,971 --> 01:18:21,970
Cover all the damn exits.

548
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:59,482
She's here.

549
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:03,953
Look everywhere.

550
01:19:03,954 --> 01:19:08,378
Under every car, look in every room.
She's here. Find her!

551
01:19:11,846 --> 01:19:15,734
- Anything?
- Come on -

552
01:20:14,187 --> 01:20:17,361
Mama.

553
01:21:47,703 --> 01:21:54,104
- This won't take long. Please. Sit.
- You think you've been smart.

554
01:21:54,204 --> 01:21:59,249
Have you covered all your bases?
Caz this, this is already over.

555
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:03,235
The whole place is wired with webcams.
- You mean these?

556
01:22:04,713 --> 01:22:09,065
Talk about covering all my bases:
Your chair is pressure-wired.

557
01:22:09,066 --> 01:22:12,426
You move a single inch, and that'll be
the last move you ever make.

558
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:16,400
And given what you know about me, you know
I don't bluff.

559
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:26,082
I don't know about you.
So I'm just gonna ask...

560
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:29,147
what happened to you, that you could
kill 23 people?

561
01:22:29,148 --> 01:22:34,425
Would you believe me if I told you
this wasn't the life I had imagined?

562
01:22:35,103 --> 01:22:39,001
When I was a child,
I wanted to be like you,

563
01:22:39,002 --> 01:22:42,036
- on the other side.
- Really?

564
01:22:42,853 --> 01:22:44,561
So what happened?

565
01:22:51,518 --> 01:22:55,141
I was nine when he
had my parents killed,

566
01:22:55,705 --> 01:23:00,037
in front of me.

567
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:05,413
So all this... the tag killer? The clues... weren't
for us at all, they were all for him?

568
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:09,650
- It was the only way I could track him down.
- And you needed us to put it all in the press?

569
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,715
Yes, but it took you so fucking long.

570
01:23:14,367 --> 01:23:17,661
You had to be really determined,
very focused, huh?

571
01:23:17,662 --> 01:23:19,910
Not focused enough.

572
01:23:23,442 --> 01:23:28,100
This morning he took the last
piece of me.

573
01:23:28,101 --> 01:23:32,030
You sent the man a message,
he sent you one right back.

574
01:23:32,031 --> 01:23:34,644
And now I'm gonna finish it.

575
01:23:34,645 --> 01:23:39,013
- Oh, I can't help you.
- Yes you can, he is protected by your government.

576
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:43,064
By a part of my government
that I cannot reach. It's CIA

577
01:23:43,065 --> 01:23:47,225
and I don't know why, but I can't
get under it, I can't get over it, you have to believe me...

578
01:23:47,226 --> 01:23:50,499
- I have tried.
- Try harder, Agent Ross.

579
01:23:55,534 --> 01:24:00,354
- You have a beautiful family.
- If you go anywhere near my family, I swear I'll... -Shhh...

580
01:24:06,031 --> 01:24:09,864
Now you know what you have to do.
Get me Luis Sandoval.

581
01:24:09,865 --> 01:24:15,333
Because if you don't, you're gonna go
to a funeral every week.

582
01:24:16,599 --> 01:24:21,502
And I will not stop, until you begin to feel
what I've felt all these years.

583
01:24:21,503 --> 01:24:24,119
I'm sorry.

584
01:24:29,429 --> 01:24:35,185
When your dinner's ready, the timer
in your chair will have expired.

585
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:38,381
Don't get up before.

586
01:24:54,615 --> 01:24:59,228
Now, you do understand that I only
took this meeting out of professional courtesy?

587
01:24:59,229 --> 01:25:03,849
- The truth is, I really can't help you at all.
- Can't, or won't?

588
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:08,575
- It's the same, really.
- But in the, uh, spirit of reaching out...

589
01:25:09,696 --> 01:25:13,885
Let me put my cards on the table.
I have met this woman.

590
01:25:13,886 --> 01:25:17,353
- This tag killer.
- It's a woman?

591
01:25:17,354 --> 01:25:20,200
- Yeah. - Is she pretty?
- She got the drop on me in my home

592
01:25:20,201 --> 01:25:24,600
and she told me, that if I don't bring her
the whereabouts of this man, she says

593
01:25:24,601 --> 01:25:28,784
she's gonna kill a member of my family every week
until I have none left.

594
01:25:28,785 --> 01:25:33,432
- Are you kidding me?
- Does it seem to you that I Would make
something like this up?

595
01:25:33,433 --> 01:25:37,250
So why don't you just... tell me what
I should do.

596
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,068
Call 911. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting.

597
01:25:42,069 --> 01:25:45,160
It starts now.

598
01:26:00,502 --> 01:26:03,840
She says, if you don't give her exactly what
she wants,

599
01:26:03,841 --> 01:26:07,540
She's gonna redecorate your whole office.
With you.

600
01:26:11,781 --> 01:26:17,522
Can you please tell her that glass is temperative resistant
to a direct hit by a 15mm ordinance?

601
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:34,011
- Ten seconds to give up that address.
- How can I be sure that if I give her the address,
she won't kill me anyway?

602
01:26:34,111 --> 01:26:36,397
She says you can't, but you can trust me,

603
01:26:36,398 --> 01:26:39,992
if you do not give her what she wants, you will be
the 24th victim on the hit parade.

604
01:26:40,716 --> 01:26:46,496
- 867 Magnolia Terrace, New Orleans.
- She asks that you keep this coversation strictly confidential

605
01:26:46,596 --> 01:26:50,053
- With pleasure.
- What about my family?

606
01:28:01,133 --> 01:28:03,482
- Good morning.
- Who are you?

607
01:28:03,842 --> 01:28:09,358
That's not important. What's important is
I need the floor plants to 867 Magnolia Terrace.

608
01:28:09,683 --> 01:28:13,350
If you don't leave my office immediately,
I will call the police.

609
01:28:13,463 --> 01:28:16,398
I really need those floor plans.

610
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:24,529
You will take positions here... here...
and here.

611
01:28:24,564 --> 01:28:27,521
You must expect the unexpected.

612
01:28:27,634 --> 01:28:30,863
She is like mist under a door.
Like a mouse on the wall.

613
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:35,625
She will not attack straight on,
and you will not see her until it's too late.

614
01:28:36,088 --> 01:28:38,989
She's that invisible.

615
01:29:11,854 --> 01:29:17,214
Don Luis, are you okay?

616
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:20,782
- Get the Mercedes.
- What happened?

617
01:29:20,878 --> 01:29:23,109
- You need to get out of here.
- Leave me alone.

618
01:29:23,502 --> 01:29:26,137
Come on.

619
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:29,847
<i>Everybody in! Let's go!<i>

620
01:30:00,521 --> 01:30:04,433
We have to move. Hurry!

621
01:30:04,634 --> 01:30:07,952
Come on.
You hide here.

622
01:30:09,146 --> 01:30:11,899
- And wait for my call.
- OK.

623
01:31:12,654 --> 01:31:16,208
- Did you get her?
- We are checking.

624
01:31:31,992 --> 01:31:34,331
I think we got her.

625
01:32:28,789 --> 01:32:32,167
Marco!

626
01:32:46,937 --> 01:32:49,728
- What the hell is going on?
- I will hold here.

627
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:24,843
- You've been waiting for this moment for a very,
very long time, right? -Yes.

628
01:36:16,042 --> 01:36:19,569
Hurry.

629
01:36:23,398 --> 01:36:29,368
- Marco?
- No. It's Cataleya.

630
01:36:29,464 --> 01:36:35,172
What were you expecting? You have ruined your whole
life trying to kill me, someone like me?

631
01:36:35,173 --> 01:36:40,617
I cannot be killed - I do the killing!
And now, it's your turn to be hunted.

632
01:36:40,645 --> 01:36:45,395
You will never find me.
But as the day follows night, believe me,

633
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:49,378
I will find you. And I will kill you.
And you know why?

634
01:36:49,413 --> 01:36:55,899
- Because I will never be where you want me to be.
- Actually...

635
01:36:57,357 --> 01:37:00,506
...you are exactly where I want you to be.

636
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,757
Eat.

637
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:39,099
You should think very carefully.
Is there anything else?

638
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:43,548
I've already told you everything.
OK? She'd come by for a couple of hours, and then she'd leave, that's it.

639
01:37:43,758 --> 01:37:47,356
Look, it's really late, I'm really tired.
If you are not going to arrest me...

640
01:37:47,456 --> 01:37:51,199
We don't actually have anything to charge you with.

641
01:37:51,299 --> 01:37:52,797
- So, can I leave?
- No.

642
01:37:53,183 --> 01:37:58,263
- I got a few more questions.
- Can I at least get a cup of coffee?

643
01:37:59,117 --> 01:38:01,547
Yeah.

644
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:04,766
- Cream and sugar?
- Yes, please.

645
01:38:14,262 --> 01:38:19,337
Jen? Thank God. I had no idea, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

646
01:38:19,408 --> 01:38:24,358
- I'm fine. Where are you?
- The FBI.

647
01:38:25,309 --> 01:38:28,746
- Danny, you know that they...
- Yeah.

648
01:38:29,202 --> 01:38:33,826
- How much time do we have?
- Forty seconds.

649
01:38:33,922 --> 01:38:38,012
- Gives us time for three questions.
- What's your real name?

650
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:44,248
- Cataleya.
- Like the flower?

651
01:38:45,273 --> 01:38:49,959
Yes, like the flower.
Twenty Seconds.

652
01:38:49,985 --> 01:38:58,099
- Will my little bird come back one day?
- Leave your window open and you'll see.

653
01:38:59,171 --> 01:39:00,463
Hey, Ross?

654
01:39:00,498 --> 01:39:03,761
We're picking something up off that
guy's phone.

655
01:39:03,926 --> 01:39:08,175
- Last question.
- I love you.

656
01:39:11,517 --> 01:39:16,420
- Give me that phone. Give it!
Hello? Hello?

657
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:39,444
You can go.
