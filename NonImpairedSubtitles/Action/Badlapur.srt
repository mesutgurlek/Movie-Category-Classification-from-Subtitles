1
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,916
What's the price?

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,375
M. G. Road Pune.

3
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,041
Give me a fair price.

4
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,666
How much you want?
Both of us want to buy.

5
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,166
So, give us a fair price.

6
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,041
I want a kilo.

7
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:29,041
I will give it to you for Rs.10.

8
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,416
- Chill.
- Do you also want?

9
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,750
Which story do I tell you now? Which one?

10
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,708
How much for that?

11
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:46,708
Rs. 50.

12
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,125
- Give me some of that.
- How about a kilo?

13
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:53,541
No, no, no, just give me a quarter kg.
Come on hurry.

14
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:54,416
Give it.

15
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,833
- Anything else?
- No.

16
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,458
Take this.

17
00:02:58,958 --> 00:02:59,416
Come on.

18
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,416
Shall we?

19
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,166
Careful! Careful! Careful!

20
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:10,166
Come.

21
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,708
And..

22
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,666
And..

23
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:26,083
- Go.
- Run!

24
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,666
Come. Come. Come. Come, come fast.

25
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,958
Come on. Sit in the front.

26
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,541
Come back.

27
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,750
Carefully.

28
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,625
Hey. Who are you?

29
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,750
How dare you get into the car!
Get out ...please.

30
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,791
Help!

31
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,250
Stop it!

32
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,375
Hey, please help.

33
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,208
- Mama.
- Who are you two?

34
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,541
Shut up. You'll be fine.

35
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,458
Faster. Faster.

36
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,875
- Hey..
- I said shut up.

37
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,375
My kid...

38
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,791
Sit down.

39
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,875
How dare you hit him? Let go.

40
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,833
Let him go. I want my son.

41
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,333
Robin.

42
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,083
Let us go... please...

43
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,458
Faster! Faster! Faster!

44
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,083
Faster.

45
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,583
Mom!

46
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:36,958
Mom!

47
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,458
- Robin.
- Mom!

48
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,333
Ah.. Robin.

49
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,708
- Robin.
- Shut up!

50
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,750
Robin!

51
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,250
Robin!

52
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,875
Stop the car! Stop the car!

53
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,455
Stop the car! Stop the car!

54
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,375
Stop the car! Stop the car!

55
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,250
Stop the car! Stop the car!

56
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,583
My kid has fallen. Stop the car!

57
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,583
Stop the car!

58
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,666
I think she's dead.
Don't worry. What are you doing?

59
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,708
Take the gun. Put it in the
same bag with the money.

60
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,041
Get out when I tell you to.

61
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,041
Slow down! Slow down!

62
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,125
Not this way. That way.

63
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:21,125
When I say. Okay?

64
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,583
Jump! Go!

65
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,166
I didn't do anything, sir.
I am just the driver.

66
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,375
The other guy did all this. He escaped.

67
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,583
Take him away.

68
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,666
Take him.

69
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,291
Lock him up.

70
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,000
Call an ambulance!

71
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,791
"O crazy guys, recognize me."

72
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,375
"O crazy guys, recognize me."

73
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,000
"Who am I?"

74
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,666
"Who am I?"

75
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,208
"O crazy guys, recognize me."

76
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:43,208
"O crazy guys, recognize me."

77
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:51,708
"O crazy guys."

78
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,541
Superb.

79
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,291
Okay, okay. Now out with the truth.
How was it?

80
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,083
How was it? I think it's a fabulous idea.

81
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,833
Superb.
I hope the boss finds it fabulous too.

82
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,125
You know how he is. "O Raghu..."

83
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,083
You are sassing me.

84
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,166
Where did you copy this from?

85
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,666
Hey... it's original.

86
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,041
My wife's idea.

87
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,500
She's going to live for a 100 years.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,500
Yeah, baby!

89
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,845
- Where's the emergency ward?
- Sir... Sir..

90
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:22,916
- Mr. Raghu.
- Yes.

91
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,666
- Your wife's in room no. 320.
- Thank you.

92
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,000
Sir, I received a phone call..

93
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
Saying that my wife Misha
met with an accident.

94
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,833
It wasn't an accident. It's a robbery case.

95
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,333
She was shot.

96
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,875
The patient is critical,
you need to come this way.

97
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,083
Misha.

98
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,083
Misha.

99
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,541
Where is Robin?

100
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,916
Misha.

101
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,916
You'll be okay, baby.

102
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:13,875
Everything will be fine.

103
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:19,250
I...I can't see anything.

104
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,916
I can't see you.

105
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,416
- I am right here, Misha.
- Where are you?

106
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,833
Right here. I am here.

107
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,375
Here, baby.

108
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,875
Misha, I am here.

109
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,708
I am here.

110
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,250
I...

111
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,958
I can't see anything.

112
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,333
Misha, I am here.

113
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,458
- Relax. -Raghu.
- Misha.

114
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,416
Misha.

115
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,375
Misha.

116
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,791
Misha.

117
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,708
Misha?

118
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:02,041
Can you.. Can you call the doctor?

119
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:06,041
Can you call the doc..

120
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,875
Pulse absent.

121
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,375
My son Robin, where is he?

122
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,250
It's a murder case now.

123
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,416
I told him not to carry a gun.

124
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,708
He said it was not loaded. He
said just do your job. Drive.

125
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,328
Who? Who is your accomplice?

126
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,458
Jayu! His name's Jayu. Jayant!

127
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:39,375
- Jayant?
- Yes.

128
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,715
Everyone calls him Jayu.
Where does he live?

129
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,208
- He lives in Yerwada.
- Huh!

130
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,750
Close to Gunjan Talkies.

131
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:45,708
What the..

132
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,000
Close to the Xerox... He lives
close to the Xerox-shop.

133
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
I see.

134
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,250
How long have you known him?
Since 3 weeks, sir.

135
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,666
That is it. I wanted a job.

136
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,166
He said he could get me a
job in the Middle East!

137
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,500
On one condition... First I had
to help him do this robbery.

138
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,041
I didn't know he had a loaded gun.
Who fired the gun?

139
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,301
I was driving, sir.
Huh! You were driving?

140
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,916
- So who fired the gun?
- He did.

141
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,416
- I see?
- Yes.

142
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,458
I was driving. -I am just a driver.

143
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,958
I see.

144
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,458
He was supposed to get
me a job in the Gulf.

145
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,750
I didn't know it was loaded. I didn't know.

146
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,750
Sir... they're showing it on TV.

147
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,208
How long? Well, the Police
are doing their job.

148
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,708
We are on the job.

149
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:38,958
Catching the criminal,
and we're doing that.

150
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,166
We'll inform you as soon as
we get any information. Okay.

151
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,166
- Are you hiding anything?
- Sir..

152
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,958
Raghu.

153
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,791
Extremely sorry, son.

154
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,791
The cremation is tomorrow at 4 pm.

155
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,583
That's a lot of kidney beans.

156
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,683
Are you planning to serve this all week?

157
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,875
It's Chilli-Corn Carne... Mexican.

158
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,958
Robbie, come eat your dinner quickly.

159
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,958
You still have to finish your
homework, don't you? Come.

160
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,018
I will either eat... or do my homework.

161
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,083
Get off that Casio right away.

162
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,458
Come.

163
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,875
Come here.

164
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:11,166
If you eat this, I'll take you
to the dentist on Saturday.

165
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,708
And if you don't, then I'll
take you to the movies.

166
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:14,708
Understood?

167
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,208
No, I didn't.

168
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,375
Mom, what's papa saying?

169
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,208
I wish I understood, son.

170
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,333
- How is it?
- Very nice.

171
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,750
Scrumplicious

172
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,500
I made a little too much.

173
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,500
If you love me you'll eat it all week!

174
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,416
Did you find him, sir?

175
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,676
He killed them, and ran
away with the loot...

176
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,958
why are you hitting me?

177
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,666
Give me two days, I'll find him.

178
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,486
I heard him talking to some girl.

179
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,541
Kalpana! That's her name.

180
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,666
Kalpana!

181
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,166
She was a tall girl.

182
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:30,333
Typist...

183
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,708
Can I get some weed?

184
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,125
It helps me think better.

185
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,125
You want weed?

186
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,583
Son, why don't you come
back with us to Delhi?

187
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,083
Come stay with us.

188
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,875
We'll take care of you...

189
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,041
And this place...

190
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,791
I mean... there's no rush.

191
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,416
You can take your time. Yeah!

192
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,208
Yes, son. Papa's right.

193
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,500
Come with us to Delhi. Drink some juice.

194
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,458
Look, Raghu. Your in-laws
aren't eating anything either.

195
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,041
Listen... rush to the supermarket..

196
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,875
And get some South Indian
instant food packets.

197
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,415
I'll cook them a curry..
Have you lost your mind?

198
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,625
You're thinking about food at this time.

199
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,445
But they are not eating anything.

200
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,083
- But..
- I am not like you...

201
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,743
to hide behind the newspaper.

202
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,923
Who's hiding behind the newspaper?
Be quiet.

203
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,333
Son, drink some juice.

204
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:59,333
Raghu...

205
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,041
Last night we called our artist..

206
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,750
To make a sketch of his partner.

207
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,083
And the result was this.

208
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,458
Do you know who he is?

209
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,541
Ranjeet! The actor!

210
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,625
He's taking us for a ride.

211
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,625
Sir, can I meet him?

212
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,791
I know how you are feeling Sir...

213
00:16:56,291 --> 00:17:00,583
I can feel your pain.

214
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,083
I can feel your pain.

215
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,041
What happened was terrible.

216
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:10,166
Jayu shot her, I already
told the inspector.

217
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,875
Jayu!

218
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,833
Can I have a minute with him?

219
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,375
May I?

220
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,750
I think they bumped off Jayu.

221
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,375
And took the entire loot.

222
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,625
I don't trust these cops.

223
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:30,750
Maybe they split the loot 50-50.

224
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,250
Honestly.

225
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,958
I didn't shoot her.

226
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,458
Shut up.

227
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,333
You were there too.

228
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,458
Hold him!

229
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,458
- Why did you kill her?
- Leave him.

230
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Let go off.

231
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,416
It was you.

232
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:58,541
You're the culprit. You rogue.

233
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,041
Raghu!

234
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,833
Have you lost your mind?
You want to kill him?

235
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,291
I will lose my job because of you.

236
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:08,916
Take him away.

237
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,916
What are you staring at?

238
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,500
Raghu!

239
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The phone's ringing?

240
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,208
Nobody's picking up.

241
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,908
Nobody's picking up the phone.

242
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,625
Maybe he's not home.

243
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,125
- Is Mr. Joshi at home?
- Come in.

244
00:18:56,625 --> 00:19:00,125
Sit.

245
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,291
R Joshi, private detective. That's me.

246
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,083
Sorry. I didn't attend my yoga class today.

247
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,143
This is the best exercise, to keep fit.

248
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,541
Come in.

249
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,166
I am sorry about your family..

250
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:24,166
The cops couldn't get the accomplice
in all these days... you think I can?

251
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,750
Hey... want a drink?

252
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,416
In here?

253
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,583
Name it and you can get it here.

254
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,583
- Want some?
- Come on.

255
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,875
Michael sir, salute him.

256
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,458
Cheers.
- Cheers! - Cheers!

257
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,458
Come here.

258
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:23,791
Where's the loot? Who has it?

259
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:30,333
Will you speak up... or do we
make you the local Draupadi?

260
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,416
You didn't get it? Explain it to him.

261
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,458
Come on.

262
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,125
Round... turn around..

263
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:43,750
Bravo.

264
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,750
Amazing.

265
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,708
Come here... gorgeous.

266
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:56,458
Where is the loot?

267
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,083
Can I get a drink?

268
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,750
She wants a drink eh?

269
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,666
Idiot..

270
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,666
Get him!

271
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:28,958
Check the bag.

272
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,500
You can go in.

273
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,500
Next.

274
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,291
You good for nothing!

275
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,458
Shame on you... You haven't
stopped your antics in here too.

276
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,333
How did you get hurt? Speak up.

277
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,041
Are you done? Have you brought my clothes?

278
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:02,083
I did. It's outside.

279
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,223
How long are they going to keep you here?

280
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:08,125
I don't know how long. I
haven't done anything.

281
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,625
Are you guilty of killing
that woman and child?

282
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,291
I said it a thousand times.
I haven't done anything.

283
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,333
- I didn't kill them.
- Swear on me.

284
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,458
You think they'll free me if I do?

285
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:24,458
Go back to the shop.

286
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,041
Hello... excuse me.

287
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:40,583
- Are you heading towards the station?
- Yes.

288
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,208
Can we go together?

289
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,916
We can share the fare.

290
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,708
- Okay.
- Yes.

291
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:50,041
- Please..
- No.

292
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:54,166
- I own a tea shop myself.
- I see.

293
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,875
What are you doing here?

294
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,958
My sister-in-law framed my brother.

295
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,166
I swear my brother's a noble man.

296
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,041
He's been sentenced for 5 years..

297
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:11,791
I swear he hasn't done anything.
It's okay.

298
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:16,708
- What are you doing here?
- My son..

299
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,166
Good for nothing guy...

300
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,833
wants to marry a whore...

301
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,083
A whore?

302
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:27,666
What is your daughter-in-law's business?

303
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,666
You are a woman, you should know
what business she will be having.

304
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:35,250
Where did he find this awful girl?

305
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,750
Real name Jhimli.

306
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:40,041
Professional name... Shabnum.

307
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,750
She charges 5000 for 2 hours.

308
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,791
And I charge 2000 for 24 hours.
How about that?

309
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,208
Liak and she were born in the same village.

310
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:52,028
Grew up in the same neighborhood.

311
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,541
Childhood friends. Liak is crazy about her.

312
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,208
She operates from Mumbai.

313
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:01,750
There's a Shagun Beauty
Parlor near Regal Cinema.

314
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,000
Ask for Mukesh aka 'Mamu'.

315
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,750
He's the pimp.

316
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,050
I want to meet Shabnam.
10,000 for 2 hours.

317
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:10,208
Get to this address by 8.

318
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:13,791
I've sent a freshie. Charged him double.

319
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:17,791
Strip him clean.

320
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:31,000
"My youth glitters like gold, sweetheart."

321
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
First time?

322
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:39,041
"The world's crazy about my silky body."

323
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:44,041
"Is it my fault, sweetheart?"

324
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:48,208
"Is it my fault, sweetheart?"

325
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:52,208
"that I blossomed at such a tender age."

326
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:13,291
"The world weighed my beauty with pearls."

327
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:17,750
"They made many excuses to cajole me."

328
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,875
"The world weighed my beauty with pearls."

329
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,791
"They made excuses to entice me."

330
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,333
Can I tie you up?

331
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:31,041
"I've many fans."

332
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:32,821
Like in the English movies, huh?

333
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:34,916
"I've many fans."

334
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,916
- It will cost you 2000 extra.
- Okay.

335
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,541
Hey...

336
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,958
Extra for tearing up my dress.

337
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:50,500
Okay.

338
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,680
They are expensive, not the cheap
stuff one gets on Fashion Street.

339
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:57,125
My top's worth 4000.

340
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:02,375
How much do you make in a day, Jhimli?

341
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,833
Who are you?

342
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,333
How do you know my name?

343
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,791
What is Liak's partner's name?

344
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:10,500
Liak who?

345
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Your boyfriend.

346
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,333
I don't have a boyfriend.

347
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,033
Everyone here is my boyfriend.

348
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,958
- Untie me or I will scream..
- Scream!

349
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,958
Call the police.

350
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,208
Who are you?

351
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:27,708
Who are you?

352
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:35,041
I am the one whose wife and kid
died in the bank that day.

353
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:37,708
Sir...

354
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,208
Sir... forgive me.

355
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:44,041
I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything.

356
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:45,541
I know Liak.

357
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,791
He's a friend... for many years.

358
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,000
He loves me too.

359
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,291
But he didn't like me working here.

360
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:55,250
No one does this job willingly.

361
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,333
But I was helpless.

362
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,500
2 months ago Liak paid a visit.

363
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
He said he'll get me out of here.

364
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,333
And two days later I saw on TV..

365
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,033
He's a fraudster and thief...

366
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:12,000
but he's no murderer.

367
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,000
Sir..

368
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:29,875
I got 3.5 million on my
son's life-insurance.

369
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,000
You can take it all.

370
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,958
Just tell me who Liak's partner is.

371
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,208
Warshid Akhtar.

372
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:44,208
Liak Mohammed.

373
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:48,208
Anand Kamble.

374
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,166
You?

375
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,583
What have you done?

376
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,625
I didn't kill them.

377
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,525
I'm tired of telling everyone.
But no one's ready to listen.

378
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:00,083
If you didn't kill them, then
why are you protecting him?

379
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:03,583
Become an approver. You'll
face lesser sentence.

380
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:07,000
I am ready, but where will I find him.

381
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,000
The Police have killed
him and kept the loot.

382
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,100
Forget it, say something dirty. Come on.

383
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:12,875
What?

384
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:17,250
You know... these days I talk to you a lot.

385
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,041
- I speak your lines too.
- Which lines?

386
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:23,125
The noises you make... Please, no!
Please, no!

387
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,785
- Please, no!
- Are you crazy?

388
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,208
- You're in jail.
- Come on.

389
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:28,708
Do it.

390
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,666
Just once.

391
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:33,791
Raghav visited me yesterday.

392
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:36,666
He knows my name.

393
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,750
How did he find you?

394
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,208
He was asking for your partner's name.

395
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,791
He said he'll pay me.

396
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,750
Otherwise he was threatening
to go to the police.

397
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,750
Hmm..

398
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,333
So what will you do now?

399
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,541
He said he same things he told the police.

400
00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:59,583
He didn't say anything more.

401
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,083
I am sorry.

402
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,541
Did you tell him about me?

403
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,281
Why would I tell him about you?

404
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:07,791
I just asked him generally.

405
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,291
Did he say anything else?

406
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:12,333
He just kept staring at me for a while.

407
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:16,791
He was happy to see me.

408
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,666
You're happy too?

409
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,541
Were you happy?

410
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:27,000
Look... I went there
because you asked me to.

411
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,980
And I don't think he's done anything.

412
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:29,958
The poor guy's is innocent. Trapped.

413
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:31,791
And he won't lie to me.

414
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:36,541
Don't waste your time and money.

415
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,916
And cough up my money too.

416
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,333
I've to pay commission to Mukesh as well.

417
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:45,333
And so many other expenses too.

418
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,375
Thank you.

419
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:54,208
Thank you.

420
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,333
"My youth glitters like gold, sweetheart."

421
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,791
You please everyone, don't you?

422
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,541
Now please me.

423
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:26,458
"World is crazy after my beauty."

424
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:31,416
"What's my mistake, sweetheart?"

425
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,916
"What's my mistake, sweetheart?"

426
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,791
What are you thinking? Dance.

427
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:39,791
"I turned young at such a tender age."

428
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:48,948
Is this how you dance for Liak?

429
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:52,583
"My youth glitters like gold, sweetheart."

430
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:17,666
"The world weighed my beauty with pearls."

431
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:21,916
"They made many excuses to cajole me."

432
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:26,000
"The world weighed my beauty with pearls."

433
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,208
"They made excuses to entice me."

434
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:34,208
"I am like a bud... and
many bees are after me.."

435
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:50,625
Next time you meet Liak, tell him about me!

436
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,083
The Court sentences Liak
to 20 years imprisonment..

437
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,875
For loot and murder!

438
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,500
Don't worry.

439
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,125
- I'll do something.
- Move.

440
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:01,958
I'll come see you.

441
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,458
Liak.

442
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,833
Liak.

443
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,208
Come on, move.. move..

444
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:10,868
How many times do I tell you?

445
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:15,166
Move.

446
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:18,625
Any message for Jhimli?

447
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,250
Come on!

448
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,950
- Don't go ahead.
- Sir.. sir..

449
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,416
What did you say?

450
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:27,416
Back.

451
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:28,916
Go back.

452
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,625
Keep him back.

453
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,708
Get inside.

454
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,625
Move.. move away.

455
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,645
Mr. Raghav, your wife and child died..

456
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,718
During the Jan-Laxmi
Sahakari Bank heist.

457
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:41,448
The Court has sentenced Liak
to 20 years of imprisonment.

458
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:42,458
How do you feel?

459
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,083
Do you think you have got justice?

460
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:47,750
How do you feel, sir? 20 years...
How do you feel?

461
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,875
Answer us, sir.

462
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,083
Did you get the justice, sir?

463
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:56,083
Say something, sir. Sir.. sir.. - 20 years.

464
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,750
How many pages left?

465
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,250
40.

466
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:47,000
I read the murderer's name
while you were bathing.

467
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,300
The man hiding behind the cupboard..
Raghu!

468
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Don't do that.

469
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,113
I am telling you, don't do that.

470
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:55,416
(in Tamil) Don't pester me.

471
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:58,083
"I don't know what you say."

472
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,500
"I don't know... don't know what you say."

473
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,083
"But I want to play the game of love.."

474
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:06,208
I am at the climax, please
don't disturb me. Vamoose!

475
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:10,083
I can give you a better climax.

476
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:14,083
Oh really?

477
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:22,750
So let's see what you got!

478
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,166
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

479
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,666
I am waiting.

480
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:31,000
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle.

481
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,666
I've seen you on TV.

482
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,333
Uncle.

483
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,625
Isn't he from that TV serial?

484
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,708
Why would a TV actor travel on a train?

485
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,833
- If we can, so can he!
- He can't!

486
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:50,875
Mister, aren't you Kusum's
husband from that TV serial?

487
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,125
Did you take part in "Kaun Banega Crorepati
(Who wants to be a Millionaire"?

488
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:54,745
Yes, I think I had seen him.

489
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:57,206
I think he was one of the
contestants on that show.

490
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:57,916
Must be! Looks familiar.

491
00:35:58,416 --> 00:35:59,875
Aren't you the guy whose
wife and kid were killed..

492
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,000
During the bank heist.

493
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,000
Don't you have any manners at all?!

494
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:04,041
"I search for my sweetheart."

495
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,375
Have you lost your mind?

496
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,750
Are you crazy?

497
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:15,750
"But he is nowhere to be found."

498
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:23,875
"His memory is a wound in my soul..."

499
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,875
"Separation is my eternal destiny."

500
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,416
"It's lost... lost.."

501
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:44,875
"What we stole away from time."

502
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:49,250
"And hid in our dreams."

503
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:55,208
"It's lost... lost.."

504
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:58,791
"What we stole away from time."

505
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:01,791
"And hid in our dreams."

506
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:05,208
"The body's finely woven like a cloth."

507
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:09,583
"My eyes are drenched." - Stand up.
What happened?

508
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:13,125
"The body's finely woven like a cloth."

509
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,833
"My eyes are drenched."

510
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:19,833
What happened? Stand up... what happened?

511
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:29,083
- Name?
- Raghu.

512
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:33,250
- Where are you from?
- Pune.

513
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,250
How long will you stay?
20 years.

514
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:43,000
After 20 years in jail..

515
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,060
You won't remember anything, Gabbar.

516
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:52,583
No jail on earth... can keep
Gabbar caged for 20 years.

517
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:58,000
And the day I escape..

518
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Done yet? Be quick!

519
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:00,666
This is all we have.

520
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:04,458
And the others?

521
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:58,416
Stop.. stop..

522
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,750
Cabbage on Tuesdays.

523
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,333
Gourds on Wednesdays.

524
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,916
Eggplants on Friday.

525
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:21,458
Potatoes on Saturday.

526
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,083
Eggs on Sunday.

527
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:27,083
A Beating on Monday.

528
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,833
What day is it today?

529
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:35,000
Hey... what day is it today?

530
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,000
Hey..

531
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:56,541
Chicken curry!

532
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:59,875
Mutton!

533
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,333
Mutton-leg soup!

534
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,750
Bread. Whose birthday is it?

535
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,750
It's my birthday, get in the line.
Happy birthday to you!

536
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:53,583
Hello.

537
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:55,125
Wagle, come in,

538
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,875
There's a crow electrocuted at picket no.3.

539
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:00,833
We'll need to cut-off the
power-supply for 10-15 minutes.

540
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:04,833
So we can get the crow out.

541
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:28,041
Get him!

542
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:55,333
- I did meet him... in Tihar jail.
- Who?

543
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,333
Charles Shobraj.

544
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:00,458
What a deadly man.

545
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,791
Amazing personality.

546
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,371
He escaped from jail 14 times.
What are you saying?

547
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,958
Afghanistan... Paris... Bangkok.

548
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:11,083
- He even broke out of Tihar.
- I see.

549
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:12,875
And this Kaalia..

550
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:14,375
Hey Kaalia..

551
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:18,416
"It's impossible to restrain anyone.."

552
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:23,333
"The hunter's a bit eccentric."

553
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,333
"The bird will fly free one day.."

554
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,166
Congratulations, Liak.

555
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:31,208
This time you made it out of the gates.

556
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:35,208
Keep at it... you will definitely make it
to the bus stop in another 10-12 years.

557
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:44,583
Catch him someone..

558
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:05,541
I didn't do anything.

559
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:09,541
He just fell down!

560
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:40,000
Come and drench me, O rain!

561
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,416
Come and drench me, O rain!

562
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:47,875
Wash over me and cleanse my mind.

563
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:52,458
Wash over me and cleanse my mind.

564
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,416
Come and drench me, O rain!

565
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:58,666
Come and drench me, O rain!

566
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:01,583
How long can I hold back?

567
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,458
How long can I hold back?

568
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:08,875
The flute yearns to sing.

569
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:13,083
The flute yearns to sing.

570
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:16,041
How long can I hold back?

571
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,875
How long can I hold back?

572
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:22,958
The flute yearns to sing.

573
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:27,000
The flute yearns to sing.

574
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,875
It calls me..

575
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:35,875
Mr. Raghav?

576
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,083
Thank God! I should be given
a medal for finding you.

577
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:41,583
May I come in?

578
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:44,355
I don't want to buy anything.
No, I am not selling anything.

579
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:45,666
Please.

580
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,416
Thank you.

581
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:54,458
Shobha.

582
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:57,333
I run a NGO. Prayaas.

583
00:46:57,833 --> 00:47:03,583
We work towards
rehabilitating jail inmates.

584
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:07,583
Actually...

585
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:11,875
I am here because of Liak.

586
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:14,125
Liak Tungekar.

587
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,291
He's got stomach cancer.

588
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:19,083
He's got only a year.

589
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:20,583
What do you want?

590
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,791
He can be released on medical grounds.

591
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:24,625
Seek treatment.

592
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:28,083
He can live the rest of
his life respectably.

593
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:32,750
If... you give him a pardon letter.

594
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,208
- Is he in pain?
- Excuse me?

595
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:38,333
Pain?

596
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:41,458
Not yet, but... he's undergoing Chemo.

597
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:45,041
He should have been publicly
hanged 15 years ago.

598
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:46,708
But this isn't bad either.

599
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:50,708
He'll die a slow death.

600
00:47:59,166 --> 00:47:59,916
Actually... you've come all the way here..

601
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:02,666
To give me this news, so thank you.

602
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,291
- Ms...?
- Shobha.

603
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,333
Shobha.

604
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,791
I feel like celebrating today.

605
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:10,625
I might order a Chinese meal.

606
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:13,791
Raghav, Liak's been in jail for 15 years.

607
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,833
He's sick, and he's dying.

608
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,083
And all he asks is to die outside jail.

609
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:21,375
In his own home, close to his mother.

610
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,166
Only you can fulfill his last wish.

611
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:28,791
So please... forgive him.

612
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:31,666
Do you have kids, Ms. Shobha.

613
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:35,583
I have a daughter... Nitasha.

614
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:39,583
She's in the 4th grade.

615
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:48,500
Imagine if someone like Liak abducts
your daughter, and kills her.

616
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,480
And you have see her dissected body..

617
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:56,666
In the post mortem
room of some hospital.

618
00:48:57,166 --> 00:49:04,291
Will you forgive? Because
it's been 15 years?

619
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,791
I don't know.

620
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:08,291
But I do know...

621
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:12,041
that people can change
after spending time in jail.

622
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:14,208
Meet him once.

623
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:20,500
See for yourself, and then decide.

624
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,375
I've brought his reports.

625
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:27,708
I just want to show you all these things.

626
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:31,708
Goodnight.

627
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,625
I've left my card.

628
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:49,916
In case you change your mind.

629
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:52,458
Be careful at the over-bridge.

630
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:56,958
It gets foggy during the monsoons.

631
00:49:57,458 --> 00:50:01,916
With or without your help... Liak
will find release in a year.

632
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,291
That's the decision of God.

633
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:06,750
But what about you?

634
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,125
You don't even have a picture of
your wife and child in this house.

635
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:15,125
You're in a prison yourself.

636
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,791
Mr. Raghav?

637
00:51:49,291 --> 00:51:51,250
Govind Mishra, remember?

638
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:55,458
Three promotions, two bypass surgeries!

639
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:58,083
I am retiring at the end of the month.

640
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:02,666
But an open case still hurts.

641
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:07,583
If Liak is released, he will
surely contact his partner.

642
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,583
And then you will catch him, right?

643
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:16,291
Madam, fruits aren't allowed inside.

644
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:18,041
Let him take it.

645
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:19,541
- Okay.
- Thank you.

646
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:23,291
Yadav.

647
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:43,541
Thank you, sir.

648
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:46,916
If you forgive me, I can get out of here.

649
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:51,625
They say I've got only
one year left to live.

650
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,125
My life's..

651
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:57,291
My life's ruined.

652
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:04,208
I feel terrible about what
happened to your family.

653
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:08,166
I've heard all this 15 years ago.

654
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:11,708
Tell me something new.

655
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,666
Shall I?

656
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:17,708
I feel so terrible about your family..

657
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:20,688
The first thing I'll do after
getting out is meet my partner..

658
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,750
Take my share of the loot.

659
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:29,375
And have a good time with
Jhimli for 10 months.

660
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:32,416
No, Liak.

661
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:36,291
There's just one way to get out of here.

662
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:38,111
Tell me the name of your partner.

663
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,666
How can I tell you what I don't know?

664
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:44,666
I tried telling the police..
You're going to die here.

665
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,208
You have a family?

666
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,500
A Daughter.

667
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,500
- Don't you find this job tough?
- Yes.

668
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:01,000
Raghu?

669
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,000
Excuse me.

670
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:24,708
"As you set foot on the
threshold of my heart."

671
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:33,708
"I dedicated my life to
you forever, beloved."

672
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:36,875
"I learned to live... live.."

673
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:42,750
"I learned how to live, sweetheart."

674
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:47,333
"I don't know how to live.."

675
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:51,333
"I don't know how to live
without you, sweetheart."

676
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:02,541
"Every word I said about you... is true."

677
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:07,291
"Straight from my heart."

678
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:11,083
"Since we met..."

679
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:15,458
"my world feels beautiful, my love."

680
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:20,250
"I've finally found my sky."

681
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:24,750
"We complete each other."

682
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:32,916
"I dedicated my life to
you forever, beloved."

683
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:37,666
"I learned to live... live.."

684
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:44,041
"I learned how to live.."

685
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,833
Sir, I am Liak's mother.

686
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,093
Forgive me, but I am not
signing any letter.

687
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,458
- Sir..
- Sorry.

688
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:57,083
Sir, I know who was
Liak's partner in crime.

689
00:55:57,583 --> 00:56:01,583
Sir.

690
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:06,041
I know... his partner's name.

691
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:08,708
- Did Liak send you?
- No, sir.

692
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:12,750
He'll kill me if he finds out.

693
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,541
Last week he called me from jail.

694
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,708
He told me his partner's name..

695
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:21,448
And asked me to contact him.

696
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,375
I've got his phone number and address.

697
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:28,000
Don't let my son die in jail.

698
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,458
Come in.

699
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,833
- Forgive him.
- Come in.

700
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:35,373
You know his partner's name
and address, don't you?

701
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:39,083
- Yes, sir.
- Come... please sit.

702
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:45,625
Sir.

703
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:47,458
Sir, I have been blessed with a baby girl.
Sweets for you.

704
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:49,078
- Congrats.
- Thank you, sir.

705
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:50,958
Sir, you've to come over
for the naming ceremony.

706
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:55,791
Sorry, I am going on a break.
Are you going home?

707
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:59,791
Yes.

708
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:18,458
On 27thMay, 2000 Liak Tungekar..

709
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:22,625
And his missing accomplice murdered
my wife Misha and son Robin.

710
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,666
During a bank heist.

711
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:27,086
The court sentenced Liak
to 20 years in prison..

712
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:29,291
Of which he has served 15.

713
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:32,625
Last week I was informed that
Liak is suffering from cancer.

714
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:34,165
I can never forgive him...

715
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,083
the senseless deaths
of my wife and child...

716
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:40,583
And yet, Liak dying in jail
won't give me any solace.

717
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:45,625
I request the court to cut short
the remainder of Liak's sentence.

718
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:47,205
I want him to be released..

719
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:50,166
So that he can receive treatment
and live the rest of his..

720
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:54,166
Life with dignity.

721
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,250
I am going... to the bus stop.

722
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,541
And then straight to Bangkok.

723
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,333
I'll get all the massages. Thai...
Sandwich... the works!

724
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:06,458
Give him a good foot massage ok...

725
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:10,458
Do it correctly, okay?

726
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:31,291
Yeah.

727
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:36,583
But why did you break the legs?

728
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:40,250
They're foreigners; They want
the entire roast chicken.

729
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:41,250
Yeah.

730
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,750
Good morning, sir. It's on the third floor.

731
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,750
See you.

732
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,500
Oh!

733
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,125
Excuse me, do you need help.

734
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:04,125
No, I am fine. Thanks.

735
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:09,791
Okay.

736
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:19,708
Listen... I said I don't need help.

737
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:22,916
My husband's on his way to pick me up.

738
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:26,375
You can... go.

739
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,708
- Do you read the papers?
- What?

740
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:30,666
This area isn't safe.

741
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:35,083
Recently there's been a few
robberies and a murder.

742
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:38,958
Don't worry, I'll wait here
until your husband arrives.

743
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:44,291
No, no, no, I am fine. Really.

744
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:46,666
If you wish, I'll wait by your car.

745
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,958
You can take my car.

746
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:52,958
There's a petrol pump up
ahead, you can get help.

747
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:03,875
- Do you watch films?
- Sometimes.

748
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:07,500
When a girl asks for a lift on
a deserted road at night...

749
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,458
either the driver's a serial
killer, or the girl's a ghost.

750
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,375
You think negative.

751
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:14,416
It can be a romantic film too.

752
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:19,125
"I met a beautiful stranger.."

753
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:21,458
Okay, okay...

754
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,791
I've a big-tough husband,
and he has your number.

755
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:27,708
- Really?
- Of course, I just messaged him.

756
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:30,328
Whether you're a lover or a
killer, you'll be caught.

757
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:33,041
Already caught, madam.
Oh, you're married.

758
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,541
Thank God for that.

759
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:37,041
I was really scared.

760
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:38,666
Lovely.

761
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:40,458
And he's so adorable.

762
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:43,208
- What are their names?
- Misha. Robin.

763
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:47,416
Oh... very cute.

764
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:48,916
Was it a love-marriage?

765
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:52,208
Oh... so sorry. I am just
returning from a wedding, so..

766
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:54,148
That's the only thing on my mind.

767
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:56,416
You don't have to answer that at all.
Love marriage.

768
01:02:56,916 --> 01:03:00,416
Ours was a love-marriage too.

769
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:06,666
It's here?

770
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:10,625
Yes, on the left.

771
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:14,625
Thank you. Thank you so much,
I really appreciate it.

772
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:20,166
- Coffee?
- Won't your husband be at home?

773
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:22,333
Actually, we own a restaurant.

774
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:23,500
- Konkan Queen.
- Is that yours?

775
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,040
Yes, it's in Vimaan Nagar.

776
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:26,750
It's the best sea food in Pune.

777
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,250
Why don't you bring Misha and Robin along?
Yeah.

778
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:30,583
Please come. Okay.

779
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:32,416
- Kanchan.
- Raghu.

780
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:36,416
Take care, Kanchan.

781
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,041
- Hi.
- Surprise!

782
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:42,208
Oh, my God. What a pleasant surprise.

783
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:43,833
- Did you meet Harman?
- No.

784
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:47,833
Hold on.

785
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:52,416
This is Raghu... Harman.

786
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:54,125
He dropped me home last night.

787
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:55,916
Hello, Harman.

788
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:56,833
Thank you.

789
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,833
- Sit.
- Yeah.

790
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,958
You didn't bring Misha and Robin along?

791
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:06,416
- They are no more.
- What?

792
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:12,208
Actually, they died 15 years
ago during a bank heist.

793
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:13,041
I am so sorry.

794
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,041
I didn't get the opportunity
to tell you last night.

795
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:16,861
And you were already so stressed.

796
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:18,608
I didn't want to bring up the past.

797
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,375
Oh my God. I am really sorry.
What a tragedy.

798
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:24,583
No, the real tragedy is
that it's been 15 years..

799
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:28,583
And the murderer is still at large.

800
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,875
I am very hungry. What's
the specialty here?

801
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:37,875
I'll just get it. You'll love it.

802
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:45,833
Cheers.

803
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:04,166
Have we met before?

804
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:06,750
You have met my wife and child.

805
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,666
Main Street, Bank robbery.

806
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:14,000
What rubbish.

807
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,625
Nonsense.

808
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:22,916
I know everything, Harman.
What do you know?

809
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:24,666
You know nothing.

810
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:27,927
If you know, why don't you go to the
police? What are you doing here?

811
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,606
I wanted to get a good look at you..

812
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:32,458
Before I go to the police.

813
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:37,541
Anyway... Sit.

814
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:40,208
What do you want?

815
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:43,083
You need to eat this by
hand, for better taste.

816
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,583
Thank you.

817
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:47,333
By the way, your husband has
invited me home tomorrow..

818
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:51,750
For lunch. Oh, that's wonderful.

819
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:53,708
I forgot the sauce.

820
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:56,833
I'll be back in a bit. Okay.

821
01:06:57,333 --> 01:07:00,208
Sorry.

822
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,125
She doesn't know anything.

823
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:08,041
Please don't involve my wife.
See you tomorrow.

824
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:12,041
At lunch.

825
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:17,583
Where did he go?

826
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:21,583
He got an urgent phone call.

827
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:41,708
Hi, Raghu.

828
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:44,708
Liak will be released tomorrow.

829
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:47,583
I was thinking about...
meeting you personally..

830
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:49,083
To say thank you.

831
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:52,791
When can we meet?

832
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:05,291
- Hello, Harman.
- Hi.

833
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:08,916
Please sit.

834
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,208
Lunch was a great idea, thank you.

835
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:14,958
I am so sorry!

836
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,875
I really am sorry.

837
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:20,791
Harman told me everything last night.

838
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:22,833
I don't..

839
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:26,291
Look, I admit I was involved
in that bank robbery.

840
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:29,375
But I didn't murder your wife and kid.

841
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:31,083
I swear.

842
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:33,125
Liak fired the gun.

843
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:34,750
I was in the back seat.

844
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,750
I didn't know that gun was loaded.

845
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,750
Liak says the same thing.

846
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:43,750
I am really sorry.

847
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,958
Nice house.

848
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:53,958
Misha would've really liked this house.

849
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:00,458
Misha loved these things.

850
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:04,375
Everywhere we went, she
collected these things.

851
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:07,875
But never took them out.

852
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:13,666
She would say that Robin might
break it, or... Pune's too dusty..

853
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:16,375
She liked all this.

854
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:21,416
What do you want from us?

855
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:23,583
What can you give?

856
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:26,041
Money.

857
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:28,291
No.. No..

858
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:29,958
Oh my God.

859
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,833
Oh my God.

860
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,666
No.. No.. No..

861
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:36,166
Alright.

862
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:38,000
You'll give me money?

863
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,000
How much can you give?

864
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:52,458
10 million. You have 20 seconds.

865
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:55,333
Give me a better answer,
Or I'm calling the police.

866
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,041
25 million.

867
01:09:57,541 --> 01:10:01,666
I've Liak's share as well. You can
take that too. - Take everything.

868
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:04,708
Everything. The hotel, house... everything.

869
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:09,708
I...know Harman. He can never kill anyone.

870
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:11,916
I am sorry. I am sorry.

871
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,291
Forgive us, please.

872
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:19,791
Harman. Kanchan loves you a lot.

873
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:21,291
Apologize to her.

874
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:25,875
Say "I am a murderer, Kanchan".

875
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:31,000
"Yet you want to save me. Thank you."
Okay.

876
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,500
Say it!

877
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,041
Say it!

878
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:39,958
Kanchan, I am a murderer.

879
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:44,000
Yet you want to save me.

880
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:48,000
Thank you.

881
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:52,291
"I forgive you, Harman."

882
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:55,958
Say it.

883
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:57,791
I forgive you, Harman.

884
01:10:58,291 --> 01:11:00,583
"But in return." Say it.

885
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:04,583
But in return... I want
to sleep with Raghu.

886
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:15,000
Please stop..

887
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,500
I am ready. I am ready.

888
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,500
- I am ready. I am ready.
- Raghu...

889
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,375
- Koko! Go away.
- I am ready.

890
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:23,555
Go away Koko. Have you lost your mind?
Will you leave us alone then?

891
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:25,458
- What are you saying?
- Just shut up!

892
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:28,333
Do you want him to go to the police?

893
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:30,333
Come, the bedroom's upstairs.

894
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:32,083
Have you lost your mind?

895
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:33,666
- Come on.
- Koko.

896
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:36,583
- I'm ready to do anything you want.
- Koko.

897
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:38,666
Just shut up!

898
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:45,083
Now you... try and forget this!

899
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:49,083
No... Koko!!

900
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,000
Take your clothes off.

901
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:18,791
Right here.

902
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,875
What the hell is wrong with you?

903
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:05,583
You're ready to sleep with
me to save a murderer?

904
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,625
He killed a child.

905
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:09,245
- He's a murderer.
- No, no..

906
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:09,958
- He..
- No.

907
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:13,166
Harman didn't kill Misha and Robin.

908
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:17,166
I believe him, please trust me.

909
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:25,666
Okay.

910
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:29,666
Let's have some fun.

911
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:57,083
If you fall down the stairs outside...

912
01:13:57,583 --> 01:14:00,625
- You'll hurt your leg, won't you?
- Yes.

913
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,791
How will you scream?

914
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,333
Scream?

915
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:05,833
Scream.

916
01:14:05,916 --> 01:14:07,125
Louder.

917
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:10,166
Louder.

918
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:14,166
Louder.

919
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:22,041
- Say my name.
- Raghu.

920
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,666
Raghu. Raghu.

921
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:25,666
Raghu.

922
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:27,750
Scream. Scream. Scream.

923
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:31,750
- Scream.
- Raghu.

924
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,541
Yes, Kanchan!

925
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:36,708
- Yes, Kanchan!
- Raghu.

926
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:40,666
Yes, Kanchan!

927
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:46,000
Liak is being released tomorrow.

928
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:51,208
What was the agreement between you two?

929
01:14:51,708 --> 01:14:55,333
I have to keep his money
and passport ready.

930
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:59,333
He said he'll call me once he's out.

931
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:08,166
When Liak calls, you'll tell me, right?

932
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:10,708
Yes.

933
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:13,583
Lunch was good.

934
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:17,583
I'll be back.

935
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:27,291
Nothing happened.

936
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:31,791
Nothing happened, Harman.

937
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:35,791
He didn't even touch me.

938
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:37,651
I think he's trying to torture us.

939
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:42,041
He's completely insane.

940
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:46,041
Nothing happened.

941
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,250
Greetings, auntie.

942
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,708
Greetings.

943
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:26,375
- Greetings.
- Hello.

944
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:28,583
Recognize me?

945
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:32,208
- Hey, Liak.
- Wilson.

946
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:37,041
Idiot, you became a priest.

947
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:41,041
Drop in at the Church.

948
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:44,583
You were supposed to come tomorrow.

949
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:47,416
Fine, I'll come tomorrow.

950
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:51,416
Come on in.

951
01:16:57,166 --> 01:17:00,541
I had prayed to Ajmer Sharif.

952
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:05,375
Now that you're back, We must go...

953
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:09,375
Who'll look after the tea shop?

954
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:34,416
Pakya, get me some soda.

955
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,000
Jhimli who?

956
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,125
She was also called Shabnum.

957
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:41,208
She worked here 15 years ago.

958
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:44,708
This isn't Maratha Mandir?

959
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,791
Want me instead?

960
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:51,791
- Yes...
- No..

961
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:59,041
You?

962
01:17:59,541 --> 01:17:59,708
When did they release you?

963
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:01,208
Didn't you hear?

964
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:03,041
- It was in the newspapers.
- What?

965
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:05,291
I did some good deeds in jail..

966
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:07,458
So, they released me early.

967
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:11,458
Won't you invite me in?

968
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:20,833
Did you break-out of jail?

969
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:24,833
Ohhh... my veggies.

970
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:31,416
Will you eat something?

971
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,583
Nice flat.

972
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:35,375
This is a classy pad. Wow.

973
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:36,875
Who gave you the address?

974
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:39,583
I went to the old haunt.

975
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:41,208
Why did you go there?

976
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:44,000
I went looking for you.

977
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,416
How about a drink?

978
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:50,041
- Do you drink so much?
- No, he gets it.

979
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:53,875
He can't take it home.

980
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:56,208
This is Patill sir's home.

981
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:58,541
Lives in Jalna with his family.

982
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:02,875
He comes here once a week.

983
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:08,500
Is Patil a... politician or gangster?
He is loaded.

984
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,208
Wants to be a politician.

985
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:17,625
Jhimli, I needed to borrow
some money, I'll return it.

986
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,125
How much?

987
01:19:19,291 --> 01:19:20,291
Whatever you can lend me.

988
01:19:20,791 --> 01:19:22,416
I'll return it with interest.

989
01:19:22,916 --> 01:19:24,875
Yeah.

990
01:19:25,375 --> 01:19:28,875
You cannot pay my interest.

991
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,458
Tell me something..

992
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:57,000
How is Patil as a person?

993
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,660
He's fine. Didn't I tell you?

994
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:02,250
You did?

995
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:06,625
Does he love you?

996
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:10,625
What do you care?

997
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:18,125
Tell me.

998
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:21,000
Does he love you like I do?

999
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:25,000
Do you love him?

1000
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:33,041
Look...

1001
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:38,083
once upon a time you and
I made an amazing couple.

1002
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,791
I so looked forward to meeting you...

1003
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:44,958
spending time with you.

1004
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:50,416
And you do it all by going to jail.

1005
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:54,416
Take this money and get lost.

1006
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:04,416
You're right. Back then we were an item.

1007
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:08,416
I'll return this money.

1008
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,291
Enjoying?

1009
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:19,625
I am. I am.

1010
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,750
Will you come back again?

1011
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,750
I will.

1012
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:25,250
Advance booking.

1013
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:26,708
Thank you.

1014
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:30,333
Count the money.

1015
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:34,333
Come now... get lost.

1016
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:44,708
I'm going to Pune now.

1017
01:21:45,208 --> 01:21:46,875
You'll follow me.

1018
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:48,855
Let's go together and share the fare.

1019
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,791
We'll save some money too.

1020
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:53,958
So?

1021
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:55,898
Where were you? Where have you been?

1022
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:59,291
I am not a kid to tell you everything.

1023
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:02,041
It's very late, get some sleep.

1024
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:04,333
If only you would let me sleep.

1025
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:08,333
You're a real pain..

1026
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:27,833
Hello.

1027
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:31,833
- Harman's become a gentleman.
- Liak.

1028
01:22:36,791 --> 01:22:38,500
I heard that you own a restaurant now.

1029
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And you even got married.

1030
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,583
Where are you calling from?

1031
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:44,083
Your number can be tracked.
Whose number is this?

1032
01:22:44,583 --> 01:22:48,791
I didn't utter your name for 15 years
I won't get you in trouble now.

1033
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:52,958
Is my passport and money ready?

1034
01:22:53,458 --> 01:22:55,583
How much?

1035
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:57,083
Say that again.

1036
01:22:57,416 --> 01:23:00,250
- 25 million.
- And passport?

1037
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,666
That's ready too, I just need your photo.

1038
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:06,041
Where do we meet? Won't you invite me home?

1039
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:08,708
Introduce me to your wife?

1040
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:10,291
Is she close-by?

1041
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:14,291
Give her the phone.

1042
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:23,291
Hello.
Hello, bhabhi I am Liak, Harman's friend.

1043
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:26,231
I was in South Africa for 15 years.
I just returned to India.

1044
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:28,041
- How are you?
- I am fine.

1045
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:30,208
I've heard a lot about you.

1046
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:34,208
Please come home someday.

1047
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:45,333
10 o'clock, Bus Depot.

1048
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:55,000
Call Raghu.

1049
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:55,916
Let me think.

1050
01:23:56,416 --> 01:23:58,750
There's nothing to think. Call Raghu.

1051
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,850
You're concerned about Raghu a lot.
I am concerned about Raghu?

1052
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,125
Yeah.

1053
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:05,041
Call him.

1054
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,666
I am meeting Liak tomorrow.

1055
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:08,166
Then I'll call Raghu.

1056
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:09,833
Stupid!

1057
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:12,053
Whatever Liak is doing is for himself.
Koko.

1058
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:15,375
- Koko.
- Don't try to save him.

1059
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:19,291
Damn you!

1060
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:20,833
Raghu, Kanchan here.

1061
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:27,208
Liak called. Harman wants to talk to you.

1062
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:29,750
Talk to him!

1063
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:30,750
Hello.

1064
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:34,458
What did he say?

1065
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:37,916
I am meeting him tomorrow
at 10 at the bus depot.

1066
01:24:38,416 --> 01:24:39,416
You will not meet him.

1067
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,208
I will.

1068
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:45,083
I'll collect his share of the
money from you. Meanwhile...

1069
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:53,166
Book two tickets to Shirdi.
Atone for your sins.

1070
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:57,166
It's okay.

1071
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:19,666
It's a great deal, Raghu.

1072
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:22,583
Two years in Europe. It's fantastic.

1073
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:25,166
And you'll be working with the main agency.

1074
01:25:25,666 --> 01:25:27,426
You'll get a great exposure.
Superb exposure.

1075
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,208
Fantastic. I am very happy.

1076
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,458
- You look very happy.
- What?

1077
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:33,375
What?

1078
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:34,708
- What are you worried about?
- You?

1079
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:36,768
How can I live without you for 2 years?

1080
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:38,208
We can't meet, I can't see you.
How will we..

1081
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:38,833
Relax.

1082
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:41,125
It's okay. It's just two years.

1083
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:42,750
In two years we'll know..

1084
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,450
Whether we're really serious
about each other or not.

1085
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:49,375
Who knows... you might find
a nice, sexy French girl.

1086
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:51,916
You know a lot of girls
hit on me and stuff.

1087
01:25:52,416 --> 01:25:54,708
But I want you.. I love you..

1088
01:25:55,208 --> 01:25:58,125
No, I am not letting go. I am..

1089
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:00,750
Listen...

1090
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:06,833
- I have news for you.
- What?

1091
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:09,041
- I am pregnant.
- Come on.

1092
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:13,041
I am pregnant.

1093
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:17,023
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

1094
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:20,750
This is the first thing you should
have said. - You didn't ask.

1095
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:24,416
Why are you worried? We have options.

1096
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:27,458
No abortion.

1097
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:29,541
Who's talking about abortion?

1098
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:32,666
Let's get married.

1099
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:35,166
- I am 22 and you're 21, Misha.
- So?

1100
01:26:35,666 --> 01:26:38,250
Together we're 43.

1101
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:40,625
There is a tide in the affairs of men..

1102
01:26:41,125 --> 01:26:44,791
Which taken at the flood,
leads on to fortune.

1103
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:48,916
Shakespeare.

1104
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:50,916
Raghu.

1105
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:53,833
I'll refuse the job
offer, let's have a baby.

1106
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:55,333
Are... you..

1107
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:56,916
- Let's have a baby.
- Really..

1108
01:26:57,416 --> 01:26:58,416
I want a baby now.

1109
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,230
- We're going to have a baby.
- No, no.

1110
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,041
- We're going to have a baby.
- Please.

1111
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:02,821
I am going to have a baby, guys.

1112
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:06,625
- I have done it.
- Stop.

1113
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:20,833
I am in Pune.

1114
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:24,875
Can we meet tomorrow for lunch?

1115
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:29,250
Superb.

1116
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,666
"Rip my body apart."

1117
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:36,416
"Rip my body apart."

1118
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:39,666
"Rip my body apart."

1119
01:27:40,166 --> 01:27:41,958
"Pump those bullets in my heart, because.."

1120
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:45,416
"I wish to... die today!"

1121
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:49,291
"I wish to... die today!"

1122
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:53,291
"I wish to... die today!"

1123
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:03,833
"Make my life hell."

1124
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:07,083
"Make my life hell."

1125
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:10,625
"Make my life hell."

1126
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:13,833
"I want to die with a smile."

1127
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:16,875
"I wish to... die today!"

1128
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,250
"I wish to... die today!"

1129
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:24,250
"I wish to... die today!"

1130
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:35,791
I should apologies for that day.

1131
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:39,458
But I won't.

1132
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:43,458
I understand.

1133
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:50,291
You gave us a second chance.

1134
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:51,791
Thank you.

1135
01:28:52,041 --> 01:28:54,041
Please sit. Would you like something?
Tea, coffee?

1136
01:28:54,541 --> 01:28:55,958
Harman will be back by 2 o'clock.

1137
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:59,083
So... we've very little time. Lets go!

1138
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:00,583
Where?

1139
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:01,833
The bedroom.

1140
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:05,750
Keep the wine in the fridge.

1141
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:33,708
Go take a shower, and wear this.

1142
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:37,708
Go.

1143
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:56,625
Hello, Harman. Where are you?

1144
01:29:57,125 --> 01:30:00,000
He's here.

1145
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,166
No, he's having tea. Everything's fine.

1146
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:06,041
No, I'll handle it. I am fine.

1147
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:10,041
Okay. Bye.

1148
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:33,708
Kanchan.

1149
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:37,375
- Where's Kanchan?
- Upstairs.

1150
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:41,375
Money?

1151
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:50,000
Passport... and money. Here you go.

1152
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,583
Kanchan.

1153
01:31:53,083 --> 01:31:56,625
Where are you?

1154
01:31:57,125 --> 01:31:58,208
Koko.

1155
01:31:58,708 --> 01:31:59,125
Koko.

1156
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:01,708
Koko. Koko.

1157
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:03,875
Koko. Koko.

1158
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:06,916
Koko. Koko.

1159
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:08,875
She's alive. She's alive.

1160
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:13,166
Oh God!

1161
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:16,166
I'll call the ambulance. Ambulance.

1162
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:17,875
The ambulance did come.

1163
01:32:18,375 --> 01:32:19,625
They even took her to the ICU.

1164
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:23,916
The doctors did everything.

1165
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:28,958
But she still died.

1166
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:33,625
- Koko. Koko.
- Harman.

1167
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:35,791
Koko.

1168
01:32:36,291 --> 01:32:36,708
Harman.

1169
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:39,291
Koko. Koko.

1170
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:46,166
Her eyes were open, but
she couldn't see me.

1171
01:32:46,666 --> 01:32:50,166
And she died.

1172
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,708
- Hi.
- Hi, Shobha.

1173
01:33:52,208 --> 01:33:56,083
You're late, but I forgive you. Come.

1174
01:33:56,583 --> 01:34:00,083
Come.

1175
01:34:01,958 --> 01:34:04,291
- So she's Natasha.
- Yes.

1176
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:08,291
She studies in a hostel.
Just went back yesterday.

1177
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:14,416
And husband?

1178
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:18,416
Divorced.

1179
01:34:24,166 --> 01:34:26,833
I talked to Liak, he was happy.

1180
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:28,583
He's getting good treatment.

1181
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:32,041
- All because of you.
- Because of you.

1182
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:34,791
Not just Liak, you saved me as well.

1183
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:38,125
For the first time in 15
years, I am out on a date.

1184
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:42,125
And I am... happy.

1185
01:34:42,625 --> 01:34:43,625
Thank you.

1186
01:34:43,833 --> 01:34:47,333
I am happy too.

1187
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:55,375
Do you always play these kiddie games..

1188
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:58,083
Or, are you interested
in something else too?

1189
01:34:58,583 --> 01:35:02,875
My daughter plays this. So we always
learn two new words every day.

1190
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:06,625
That's why we play this.

1191
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:10,625
Would you like to play with me?

1192
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:15,708
- What's that?
- What?

1193
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:20,000
- This?
- What?

1194
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:24,000
New shirt.

1195
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:35,333
Shall I draw the curtains
or we move to the bedroom?

1196
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,541
"Oh my enemy.."

1197
01:36:07,041 --> 01:36:10,666
"you're close to your end."

1198
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:12,666
"Oh my enemy.."

1199
01:36:13,166 --> 01:36:14,541
"you're close to your end."

1200
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:18,375
"I am an infidel for you."

1201
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:20,375
"I changed..."

1202
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,250
"My heart changed.."

1203
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:25,708
"My God has changed."

1204
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:27,833
"Everything changed..."

1205
01:36:28,333 --> 01:36:30,000
"When I changed myself.."

1206
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:34,000
"My God has changed."

1207
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:44,166
What's your name?

1208
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:45,666
- Raghu.
- What?

1209
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:47,041
Raghu.

1210
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:48,541
Have you been drinking?

1211
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:50,161
No. Just committed a murder.

1212
01:36:50,333 --> 01:36:55,541
What rubbish. Get going.

1213
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:58,583
- What did he say?
- Joker.

1214
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:00,541
"Oh my enemy.."

1215
01:37:01,041 --> 01:37:02,208
"Oh my enemy.."

1216
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,333
"you're close to your end."

1217
01:37:04,833 --> 01:37:06,250
"you're close to your end."

1218
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:08,208
"Oh my enemy.."

1219
01:37:08,708 --> 01:37:10,083
"you're close to your end."

1220
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:13,875
"I am an infidel for you."

1221
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:15,833
"I changed..."

1222
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:17,791
"My heart changed.."

1223
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:20,833
"My God has changed."

1224
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:24,833
"My God has changed."

1225
01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:39,708
SP sir.

1226
01:37:40,208 --> 01:37:44,083
First you sent goons dressed as police.

1227
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:45,708
"Sway it..."

1228
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:51,041
"Sway it, sweetheart."

1229
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:56,416
"My waist sways.."

1230
01:37:56,916 --> 01:38:00,458
"My waist sways.."

1231
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:04,208
"When I sway to the left, I create a stir."

1232
01:38:04,708 --> 01:38:08,208
"When I sway to the right, I
shake the entire district."

1233
01:38:43,375 --> 01:38:46,875
Sit down.

1234
01:38:49,083 --> 01:38:51,500
Hello.

1235
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,250
Kind attention..

1236
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:58,250
If any undeclared or suspicious
object found under the seat..

1237
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:18,458
Hello, Liak.

1238
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:21,333
What are you doing?

1239
01:39:21,833 --> 01:39:25,083
Just wanted to know how you're doing.

1240
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:26,791
How are you?

1241
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:30,791
Okay.

1242
01:39:33,125 --> 01:39:36,625
Are you waiting for someone?

1243
01:39:39,125 --> 01:39:42,625
No.

1244
01:39:45,125 --> 01:39:48,625
- Your friend's not coming.
- What friend?

1245
01:40:18,958 --> 01:40:20,333
Where's Harman?

1246
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:23,333
He's gone to Shirdi with the missus.

1247
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:24,166
Shirdi?

1248
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:25,666
Yes.

1249
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:28,958
Liak's been visiting Konkan Queen
Restaurant for the past few days.

1250
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:32,583
Yesterday he went there twice.

1251
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:34,875
Is the food good?

1252
01:40:35,375 --> 01:40:40,291
It's spicy... Tasty!

1253
01:40:40,791 --> 01:40:42,916
You're bound to get a promotion.
Send Kadam.

1254
01:40:43,416 --> 01:40:44,896
Sir, they've been missing for 5 days.

1255
01:40:45,333 --> 01:40:46,041
Their mobiles are switched off too.

1256
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:48,791
They booked a room at the
Sun N Sand hotel, Shirdi.

1257
01:40:49,291 --> 01:40:50,331
But they never checked in.

1258
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:54,041
The car's missing, and
the house locked too.

1259
01:40:57,958 --> 01:41:00,458
Why do you visit Konkan Queen so often?

1260
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:03,208
Their prawns are really good.

1261
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:06,708
You travel 12 kilometers
for their sea-food.

1262
01:41:07,208 --> 01:41:10,708
You're quite the food buff.

1263
01:41:14,416 --> 01:41:17,916
Why did you evade my man at
the cinema hall that day?

1264
01:41:24,166 --> 01:41:26,833
Did you come here?

1265
01:41:27,333 --> 01:41:31,125
I went to get some weed. I am ill.

1266
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:35,750
Your people follow me around,
no one sells me the stuff.

1267
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:40,250
What happened here?

1268
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:44,041
What do you think?

1269
01:41:44,541 --> 01:41:46,833
I feel..

1270
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:51,750
Hold on.

1271
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:55,041
Stop.

1272
01:41:55,541 --> 01:41:58,875
What's he doing here?

1273
01:41:59,375 --> 01:42:01,000
I gave Mrs Harman a lift once.

1274
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:05,583
And she invited me to the restaurant.

1275
01:42:06,083 --> 01:42:07,708
Good homely food.

1276
01:42:08,208 --> 01:42:11,250
Liak was praising the food as well.

1277
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:13,166
What do you want to say?

1278
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:17,416
15 years ago, Harman
worked in a small garage.

1279
01:42:17,916 --> 01:42:20,458
Salary, only 2000.

1280
01:42:20,958 --> 01:42:22,318
But suddenly he hit some jackpot..

1281
01:42:22,583 --> 01:42:25,125
And now owns a posh restaurant.

1282
01:42:25,625 --> 01:42:29,333
So you mean... Harman is Liak's partner.

1283
01:42:29,833 --> 01:42:33,333
Congratulations, sir.
Finally you found him.

1284
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:41,250
Found him? Not really.

1285
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:47,333
The couple's been missing since the 5th.

1286
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:49,708
So?

1287
01:42:50,208 --> 01:42:52,416
You were in Pune on the 5th, right?

1288
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:54,250
Yes.

1289
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:59,041
Where were you?

1290
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:01,125
I was on a lunch date.

1291
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:03,375
With Shobha.

1292
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:06,583
At her home.

1293
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:08,666
How long?

1294
01:43:09,166 --> 01:43:11,541
8 pm.

1295
01:43:12,041 --> 01:43:15,541
8 pm.

1296
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:21,125
8 pm is my dinner time.

1297
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:23,333
See you.

1298
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:27,333
Bye, sir.

1299
01:43:31,125 --> 01:43:35,750
Did you tell anyone about Harman?

1300
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:40,916
I never told anyone.

1301
01:43:41,416 --> 01:43:45,625
Be honest, and I won't harm you.

1302
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:49,625
I said I didn't tell anyone...

1303
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:53,833
Yes, I did.

1304
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:56,333
I told Raghav.

1305
01:43:56,833 --> 01:43:59,041
And that's the reason you're out here.

1306
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:01,791
You didn't do a thing for last 14 years.

1307
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:05,791
And now you're threatening your mother.

1308
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:19,166
What did you tell the inspector?
We had sex?

1309
01:44:19,666 --> 01:44:23,291
All I said that when I
left you were asleep.

1310
01:44:23,791 --> 01:44:24,833
What for?

1311
01:44:25,333 --> 01:44:27,750
You know he asked me such absurd questions.

1312
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:30,375
No one ever dared to speak to me like
that.. - This is a police investigation.

1313
01:44:30,875 --> 01:44:33,791
I will have to answer all their questions.

1314
01:44:34,291 --> 01:44:37,250
I don't believe this.

1315
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:41,208
I thought there was something between us.

1316
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:45,250
I really liked you.
Maybe I didn't like you.

1317
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:48,250
You sympathize with the
criminals in jail, don't you?

1318
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:56,333
But what about the people
whose lives they ruined?

1319
01:44:56,833 --> 01:44:58,708
You used me, right?

1320
01:44:59,208 --> 01:45:01,416
Maybe the inspector's right.

1321
01:45:01,916 --> 01:45:03,375
You are involved in some murder.

1322
01:45:03,875 --> 01:45:05,208
He might arrest me.

1323
01:45:05,708 --> 01:45:07,125
Put me in jail.

1324
01:45:07,625 --> 01:45:09,875
Then you'll come visit me. Hold my hands.

1325
01:45:10,375 --> 01:45:12,291
Relieve my pain.

1326
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:15,666
Sympathize with me.

1327
01:45:16,166 --> 01:45:18,046
And we can even have sex
in the doctor's cabin.

1328
01:45:18,333 --> 01:45:21,833
How dare..

1329
01:46:02,041 --> 01:46:07,416
Where's the money? Where's the money?

1330
01:46:07,916 --> 01:46:11,416
Where's my money?

1331
01:47:56,375 --> 01:47:59,125
Where's my money?

1332
01:47:59,625 --> 01:48:03,125
My friend?

1333
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:08,625
I killed Harman and his wife.

1334
01:48:09,125 --> 01:48:11,875
You killed?

1335
01:48:12,375 --> 01:48:13,791
How did you kill them?

1336
01:48:14,291 --> 01:48:16,083
With a hammer.

1337
01:48:16,583 --> 01:48:21,250
In their own bedroom.

1338
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:25,250
Do you want to know how? How I did it?
Do you want to hear?

1339
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:32,458
First I covered the room with plastic.

1340
01:48:32,958 --> 01:48:35,333
When his wife stepped out after a shower..

1341
01:48:35,833 --> 01:48:37,416
I severed a blow to her head.

1342
01:48:37,916 --> 01:48:40,125
She fell unconscious.

1343
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:45,333
Next, when Harman returned with
the money, I killed him too.

1344
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:50,458
You really killed them?

1345
01:48:50,958 --> 01:48:55,583
Your friend, whose name you
didn't utter for 15 years..

1346
01:48:56,083 --> 01:49:00,833
Was ready to give me
your share of the money.

1347
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:09,125
And his wife was ready to sleep with me...
to save him.

1348
01:49:09,625 --> 01:49:13,208
Are you telling the truth?

1349
01:49:13,708 --> 01:49:17,291
I buried them in Khadakvasla sector 3.

1350
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:21,291
And you will never find that money.

1351
01:49:26,458 --> 01:49:29,875
And now you're going to kill me too.
You're already dead.

1352
01:49:30,375 --> 01:49:33,875
You're just going to rot
for few more months.

1353
01:50:08,333 --> 01:50:11,833
Harman didn't kill your wife, I did.

1354
01:50:17,125 --> 01:50:20,000
I was confused. I went crazy for a moment.

1355
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,340
Your kid fell out and
your wife was screaming.

1356
01:50:22,833 --> 01:50:26,333
Suddenly I pulled out the gun and shot her.

1357
01:50:26,833 --> 01:50:30,333
I had blown a fuse.

1358
01:50:33,333 --> 01:50:35,458
But you had a cool mind.

1359
01:50:35,958 --> 01:50:39,125
You murdered two people... with a hammer.

1360
01:50:39,625 --> 01:50:42,291
Innocent people.

1361
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:47,458
What is the difference..
Between you and me.

1362
01:50:47,958 --> 01:50:50,125
You've gone crazy.

1363
01:50:50,625 --> 01:50:54,125
Get yourself treated.

1364
01:51:30,416 --> 01:51:31,625
What happened to you?

1365
01:51:32,125 --> 01:51:36,041
What happened?

1366
01:51:36,541 --> 01:51:37,541
Show me.

1367
01:51:37,916 --> 01:51:39,791
Your face is completely swollen.

1368
01:51:40,291 --> 01:51:42,458
You're back to your old ways, right?

1369
01:51:42,958 --> 01:51:44,750
What are you looking at?

1370
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:47,458
Jhimli.

1371
01:51:47,958 --> 01:51:50,916
I am going to die.

1372
01:51:51,416 --> 01:51:55,291
Huh?

1373
01:51:55,791 --> 01:51:58,916
That's why I was released from jail.
I've got cancer.

1374
01:51:59,416 --> 01:52:02,916
I've just one year to live.

1375
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,458
Yes.

1376
01:52:06,958 --> 01:52:09,916
I was scared to know.

1377
01:52:10,416 --> 01:52:12,500
When I was released, I
thought I'll get my share..

1378
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,750
Because I didn't utter my
partner's name for 15 years.

1379
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:25,416
And we'll travel, have fun for
10 months with that money.

1380
01:52:25,916 --> 01:52:28,541
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1381
01:52:29,041 --> 01:52:30,291
I wanted to surprise you.

1382
01:52:30,791 --> 01:52:34,291
"Jhimli.."

1383
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,708
Okay, madam... I'll change this.

1384
01:52:39,208 --> 01:52:43,041
- Chicken noodles, right?
- Hey... stop.

1385
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:44,750
Who are you?

1386
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:49,791
Sameer. From Uncle's Kitchen.

1387
01:52:50,291 --> 01:52:54,500
Sameer.

1388
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,291
How's Tony?

1389
01:52:56,791 --> 01:52:59,333
- He's fine, okay.
- Okay?

1390
01:52:59,833 --> 01:53:01,353
- Give him my regards, alright?
- Okay.

1391
01:53:01,666 --> 01:53:04,375
- Tell him I was missing him.
- Fine.

1392
01:53:04,875 --> 01:53:07,916
Tony died a month ago.

1393
01:53:08,416 --> 01:53:10,791
Who is he?

1394
01:53:11,291 --> 01:53:13,000
- You misunderstand, sir..
- Shut up.

1395
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:17,041
He's a friend, we're
meeting after a long time.

1396
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:19,833
Your friend calls himself a delivery boy..

1397
01:53:20,333 --> 01:53:22,958
And walks out with the
parcel, and you just watch.

1398
01:53:23,458 --> 01:53:26,166
You think I am a fool.

1399
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:28,541
What are you staring at?

1400
01:53:29,041 --> 01:53:31,541
Are you back to whoring again?

1401
01:53:32,041 --> 01:53:33,625
- Why you..
- Liak! Liak!

1402
01:53:34,125 --> 01:53:35,125
Stop it.

1403
01:53:35,541 --> 01:53:36,541
Keep it down.

1404
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:38,708
Liak, let go. Liak! Get lost.

1405
01:53:39,208 --> 01:53:42,000
Get out. Go.

1406
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,416
Hey... Go inside!

1407
01:53:44,916 --> 01:53:48,416
Go inside!

1408
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:02,166
Hey..

1409
01:54:02,666 --> 01:54:05,458
Wait. Wait.

1410
01:54:05,958 --> 01:54:07,416
Are you okay?

1411
01:54:07,916 --> 01:54:09,583
I told him about your cancer.

1412
01:54:10,083 --> 01:54:13,250
Here.

1413
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:14,750
I don't want it. Keep it.

1414
01:54:15,208 --> 01:54:16,791
Keep it, it's for your treatment.

1415
01:54:17,291 --> 01:54:18,416
I'm getting free treatment
from the government.

1416
01:54:18,916 --> 01:54:19,916
Don't worry. Keep it.

1417
01:54:20,333 --> 01:54:22,208
I'm sure you have other expenses.

1418
01:54:22,708 --> 01:54:26,666
Yeah, I do... if you come along.

1419
01:54:27,166 --> 01:54:28,791
Will you?

1420
01:54:29,291 --> 01:54:32,041
I...can't come now.

1421
01:54:32,541 --> 01:54:34,666
He'll be here till Monday.

1422
01:54:35,166 --> 01:54:38,666
After that I...

1423
01:54:44,458 --> 01:54:48,083
Say something dirty.

1424
01:54:48,583 --> 01:54:50,375
What was it?

1425
01:54:50,875 --> 01:54:51,875
If..

1426
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:55,750
If you bite I'll slap you tight.

1427
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:24,375
Keep the money.

1428
01:55:24,875 --> 01:55:27,208
I was supposed to get 25 million.

1429
01:55:27,708 --> 01:55:30,708
But Raghu killed my partner and his wife.

1430
01:55:31,208 --> 01:55:32,408
Now watch what I do to him...

1431
01:55:32,666 --> 01:55:37,041
Don't do anything. Wait..

1432
01:55:37,541 --> 01:55:39,708
I committed a murder.

1433
01:55:40,208 --> 01:55:42,041
I am a convicted killer.

1434
01:55:42,541 --> 01:55:46,041
If you ever hit her again, I
will kill you. Goodnight.

1435
01:56:18,958 --> 01:56:21,291
Where are you going?

1436
01:56:21,791 --> 01:56:23,250
Cleaning my house.

1437
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:26,166
What brings you here?

1438
01:56:26,666 --> 01:56:30,166
I'd like a cup of tea.

1439
01:56:34,708 --> 01:56:39,041
You didn't tell me that you
went to Harman's home too.

1440
01:56:39,541 --> 01:56:41,708
Fingerprints. Perfect match.

1441
01:56:42,208 --> 01:56:43,916
They invited me for lunch.

1442
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:47,916
You get a lot of invitations for lunch.

1443
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:56,583
- Where's the money?
- What money?

1444
01:56:57,083 --> 01:56:59,083
Don't play that game with me.

1445
01:56:59,583 --> 01:57:01,958
Liak's share of money.

1446
01:57:02,458 --> 01:57:05,041
From the bank robbery.

1447
01:57:05,541 --> 01:57:08,500
You're clearly visible in the
CC camera at Aundh signal.

1448
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,958
In Harman's car.

1449
01:57:11,458 --> 01:57:14,958
You murdered Harman and his wife.

1450
01:57:23,416 --> 01:57:25,541
What will you prove in the court?

1451
01:57:26,041 --> 01:57:28,500
That I, whose wife and kid were killed..

1452
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,250
First pardoned Liak, and
then murdered his partner.

1453
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:36,416
For money?

1454
01:57:36,916 --> 01:57:40,416
Sugar?

1455
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:43,625
You might escape death sentence.

1456
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:48,000
But jail term is guaranteed.

1457
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:51,166
Give me the money...

1458
01:57:51,666 --> 01:57:54,208
I'll erase all evidence.

1459
01:57:54,708 --> 01:57:56,333
Or else..

1460
01:57:56,833 --> 01:58:00,333
Looking for your retirement fund.

1461
01:58:04,666 --> 01:58:07,958
Call it what you may.

1462
01:58:08,458 --> 01:58:10,708
I'm retiring on Monday.

1463
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:14,708
You have until Monday, 11 o'clock.

1464
01:58:54,375 --> 01:58:58,000
These days I've no clue
about your whereabouts.

1465
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:02,958
You're just like your father.

1466
01:59:03,458 --> 01:59:06,958
Go have your dinner,

1467
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:24,625
You always curse my father.

1468
01:59:25,125 --> 01:59:28,708
There must be something good about him.

1469
01:59:29,208 --> 01:59:32,708
Tell me.

1470
01:59:34,083 --> 01:59:35,083
What do I say?

1471
01:59:35,583 --> 01:59:39,208
There must be something good about him.

1472
01:59:39,708 --> 01:59:43,666
Why are you trying to stir up the past.

1473
01:59:44,166 --> 01:59:46,625
Forget it.

1474
01:59:47,125 --> 01:59:50,625
Forget it.

1475
02:00:01,541 --> 02:00:04,583
I specifically said a
bouquet worth 500 rupees...

1476
02:00:05,083 --> 02:00:06,791
What's going on? What's all this?

1477
02:00:07,291 --> 02:00:10,125
Sir, it's your send-off today.

1478
02:00:10,625 --> 02:00:12,250
Good.

1479
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:14,541
Is it done?

1480
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:17,875
Liak, listen.

1481
02:00:18,375 --> 02:00:20,291
Go back to your stall. Stop following me.

1482
02:00:20,791 --> 02:00:23,458
- Get back to the stall.
- Listen.

1483
02:00:23,958 --> 02:00:27,458
Liak.

1484
02:00:30,875 --> 02:00:34,166
If anyone asks if there's
something good about your son..

1485
02:00:34,666 --> 02:00:36,750
So you will tell them, won't you?

1486
02:00:37,250 --> 02:00:40,541
Please do.

1487
02:00:41,041 --> 02:00:43,083
Yes, sir.

1488
02:00:43,583 --> 02:00:45,750
My last day at work today.

1489
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:48,375
What have you decided?
You won't get the money.

1490
02:00:48,875 --> 02:00:49,708
Congratulations for your retirement.

1491
02:00:50,208 --> 02:00:51,458
Don't be smart.

1492
02:00:51,958 --> 02:00:56,708
- I am coming there.
- Do what you want.

1493
02:00:57,208 --> 02:00:58,208
Where's my driver?

1494
02:00:58,291 --> 02:01:00,625
Sir, he's gone home to fetch your family.

1495
02:01:01,125 --> 02:01:03,208
Come on, get the car.
Sir, please don't go.

1496
02:01:03,708 --> 02:01:07,208
It's a small program. I'll be back soon.

1497
02:01:10,541 --> 02:01:14,666
I killed Harman and his wife.

1498
02:01:15,166 --> 02:01:16,166
What?

1499
02:01:16,583 --> 02:01:18,083
I killed those two.

1500
02:01:18,583 --> 02:01:22,625
I barged in their bedroom.

1501
02:01:23,125 --> 02:01:25,125
Covered the floor with plastic..

1502
02:01:25,625 --> 02:01:28,250
And hammered them to death.
They're both dead.

1503
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:31,958
He said he won't give me my share.

1504
02:01:32,458 --> 02:01:34,166
He refused to recognize me.

1505
02:01:34,666 --> 02:01:40,291
The bodies are at Khadakvasla sector 3.

1506
02:01:40,791 --> 02:01:42,291
I know you didn't commit the murders.

1507
02:01:42,791 --> 02:01:46,041
What's your game?

1508
02:01:46,541 --> 02:01:49,458
Tell me.

1509
02:01:49,958 --> 02:01:53,458
Say you didn't kill them.

1510
02:01:56,083 --> 02:01:59,583
Say you didn't kill them.

1511
02:02:01,833 --> 02:02:05,041
Say you didn't kill them!

1512
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:07,541
You didn't kill them!

1513
02:02:08,041 --> 02:02:10,708
Say you didn't kill them! Say it!

1514
02:02:11,208 --> 02:02:12,708
Say you didn't kill them!

1515
02:02:13,208 --> 02:02:16,208
You didn't kill them!

1516
02:02:16,708 --> 02:02:19,333
Say you didn't kill them!

1517
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:20,833
Please move back.

1518
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:22,916
Please move back.

1519
02:02:23,416 --> 02:02:25,666
Sir, you finally solved
a 15 year old case...

1520
02:02:26,166 --> 02:02:28,686
On the day of your retirement.
How do you feel? Please tell us.

1521
02:02:29,166 --> 02:02:29,250
Feeling good.

1522
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:31,750
It's a historic day for you, sir.
How do you feel?

1523
02:02:31,791 --> 02:02:32,791
Was Liak taken to jail?

1524
02:02:33,041 --> 02:02:35,250
How will you recover the stolen money?

1525
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:38,708
By selling Konkan Queen, or
do you have another option?

1526
02:02:39,208 --> 02:02:41,250
How long will he be sentenced to now?

1527
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:42,750
Please sir... please.

1528
02:02:43,208 --> 02:02:45,833
Please tell us... please..

1529
02:02:46,333 --> 02:02:49,833
Sir..

1530
02:02:57,708 --> 02:03:01,208
Pick that up, take it.

1531
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:10,833
Pawan, I asked you to get cigarettes.

1532
02:03:11,333 --> 02:03:14,833
- I've got it.
- Did you?

1533
02:03:22,416 --> 02:03:25,916
I had a great time in Bangkok.

1534
02:03:28,916 --> 02:03:32,416
He committed two murders.

1535
02:03:47,458 --> 02:03:48,875
You didn't go today either.

1536
02:03:49,375 --> 02:03:52,208
I've told you many times. Chemo
will help you relieve the pain.

1537
02:03:52,708 --> 02:03:53,958
And what happened last night?

1538
02:03:54,458 --> 02:03:55,791
You fainted again, didn't you?

1539
02:03:56,291 --> 02:04:00,458
No, it was just.. I pretend to be in pain.

1540
02:04:00,958 --> 02:04:04,666
So they give me some weed.

1541
02:04:05,166 --> 02:04:06,446
Why are you working on a Sunday?

1542
02:04:06,833 --> 02:04:08,500
Nobody else is.

1543
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,833
I make one chair in four days.

1544
02:04:12,333 --> 02:04:19,333
And outside it sells for... 3000 rupees.

1545
02:04:19,833 --> 02:04:24,708
You're good at it, keep this one for me.

1546
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:28,708
Will you get me a discount?

1547
02:04:59,458 --> 02:05:01,333
Your wife and kid's killer is dead.

1548
02:05:01,833 --> 02:05:03,625
I know.

1549
02:05:04,125 --> 02:05:07,666
So you must know... why he turned
himself over to the police?

1550
02:05:08,166 --> 02:05:12,583
Took the blame for your crimes.

1551
02:05:13,083 --> 02:05:16,708
To give you a second chance.

1552
02:05:17,208 --> 02:05:18,688
Everyone doesn't get a second chance.

1553
02:05:19,083 --> 02:05:21,375
Liak didn't get it, I didn't.

1554
02:05:21,875 --> 02:05:23,500
But you did.

1555
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,500
Don't waste it.

1556
02:05:30,875 --> 02:05:33,791
And anyway...

1557
02:05:34,291 --> 02:05:36,583
you got your revenge.

1558
02:05:37,083 --> 02:05:38,083
So, what will you do now?

1559
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:45,000
"Let me ward off your bad luck."

1560
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:51,791
"And bless you with good luck."

1561
02:05:52,291 --> 02:05:59,083
"Take me away this time."

1562
02:05:59,583 --> 02:06:07,291
"Because my breath feels lost."

1563
02:06:07,791 --> 02:06:10,958
"I wish to... die today!"

1564
02:06:11,458 --> 02:06:14,833
"I wish to... die today!"

1565
02:06:15,333 --> 02:06:18,833
"I wish to... die today!"

1566
02:06:44,791 --> 02:06:47,583
"Rip my body apart."

1567
02:06:48,083 --> 02:06:51,291
"Rip my body apart."

1568
02:06:51,791 --> 02:06:54,541
"Rip my body apart."

1569
02:06:55,041 --> 02:06:57,291
"Pump those bullets in my heart, because.."

1570
02:06:57,791 --> 02:07:00,291
"I wish to... die today!"

1571
02:07:00,791 --> 02:07:04,125
"I wish to... die today!"

1572
02:07:04,625 --> 02:07:11,541
"I wish to... die today!"

1573
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:15,375
"Make my life hell."

1574
02:07:15,875 --> 02:07:18,541
"Make my life hell."

1575
02:07:19,041 --> 02:07:21,916
"Make my life hell."

1576
02:07:22,416 --> 02:07:24,833
"I want to die with a smile."

1577
02:07:25,333 --> 02:07:27,791
"I wish to... die today!"

1578
02:07:28,291 --> 02:07:31,708
"I wish to... die today!"

1579
02:07:32,208 --> 02:07:35,708
"I wish to... die today!"

1580
02:07:56,583 --> 02:08:03,041
"Lord... summon me to
Your threshold someday."

1581
02:08:03,541 --> 02:08:06,458
"And give me the rest of the pain."

1582
02:08:06,958 --> 02:08:08,750
"And make my cry."

1583
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:15,708
"I wish to.."

1584
02:08:16,208 --> 02:08:19,083
"I wish to.."

1585
02:08:19,583 --> 02:08:23,541
"I wish to.."

1586
02:08:24,041 --> 02:08:27,333
"For a single glimpse of you.."

1587
02:08:27,833 --> 02:08:30,791
"For a single glimpse of you.."

1588
02:08:31,291 --> 02:08:33,833
"For a single glimpse of you.."

1589
02:08:34,333 --> 02:08:36,458
"I can die a thousand times."

1590
02:08:36,958 --> 02:08:39,708
"I wish to... die today!"

1591
02:08:40,208 --> 02:08:43,541
"I wish to... die today!"

1592
02:08:44,041 --> 02:08:47,541
"I wish to... die today!"

1593
02:08:58,916 --> 02:09:05,291
"Let me ward off your bad luck."

1594
02:09:05,791 --> 02:09:12,041
"And bless you with good luck."

1595
02:09:12,541 --> 02:09:19,125
"Take me away this time."

1596
02:09:19,625 --> 02:09:27,625
"Because my breath feels lost."

1597
02:09:28,208 --> 02:09:31,166
"I wish to... die today!"

1598
02:09:31,666 --> 02:09:34,916
"I wish to... die today!"

1599
02:09:35,416 --> 02:09:42,666
"I wish to... die today!"

1600
02:09:43,166 --> 02:09:45,833
"Rip my body apart."

1601
02:09:46,333 --> 02:09:49,541
"Make my life hell."

1602
02:09:50,041 --> 02:09:53,541
"Rip my body apart."

1603
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:53,708
"Oh my enemy.."

1604
02:10:54,208 --> 02:10:57,916
"you're close to your end."

1605
02:10:58,416 --> 02:10:59,875
"Oh my enemy.."

1606
02:11:00,375 --> 02:11:01,791
"you're close to your end."

1607
02:11:02,291 --> 02:11:05,666
"I am an infidel for you."

1608
02:11:06,166 --> 02:11:07,625
"I changed..."

1609
02:11:08,125 --> 02:11:09,458
"My heart changed.."

1610
02:11:09,958 --> 02:11:12,833
"My God has changed."

1611
02:11:13,333 --> 02:11:15,083
"Everything changed..."

1612
02:11:15,583 --> 02:11:17,208
"When I changed myself.."

1613
02:11:17,708 --> 02:11:21,208
"My God has changed."

1614
02:11:29,208 --> 02:11:30,625
"I changed..."

1615
02:11:31,125 --> 02:11:32,583
"My heart changed.."

1616
02:11:33,083 --> 02:11:35,875
"My God has changed."

1617
02:11:36,375 --> 02:11:38,083
"Everything changed..."

1618
02:11:38,583 --> 02:11:40,250
"When I changed myself.."

1619
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:44,250
"My God has changed."

1620
02:11:58,291 --> 02:12:01,791
"I changed..."

1621
02:12:07,625 --> 02:12:14,750
"You are not required in this world."

1622
02:12:15,250 --> 02:12:22,458
"There's a lot of peace
in the other world."

1623
02:12:22,958 --> 02:12:29,583
"You are not required in this world."

1624
02:12:30,083 --> 02:12:37,791
"There's a lot of peace
in the other world."

1625
02:12:38,291 --> 02:12:39,750
"Oh my enemy.."

1626
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:41,458
"Oh my enemy.."

1627
02:12:41,958 --> 02:12:43,833
"you're close to your end."

1628
02:12:44,333 --> 02:12:45,541
"you're close to your end."

1629
02:12:46,041 --> 02:12:47,458
"Oh my enemy.."

1630
02:12:47,958 --> 02:12:49,333
"you're close to your end."

1631
02:12:49,833 --> 02:12:53,125
"I am an infidel for you."

1632
02:12:53,625 --> 02:12:55,125
"I changed..."

1633
02:12:55,625 --> 02:12:57,083
"My heart changed.."

1634
02:12:57,583 --> 02:13:00,416
"My God has changed."

1635
02:13:00,916 --> 02:13:02,416
"Everything changed..."

1636
02:13:02,916 --> 02:13:04,541
"When I changed myself.."

1637
02:13:05,041 --> 02:13:08,541
"My God has changed."

1638
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:18,375
"My God has changed."

1639
02:13:18,875 --> 02:13:21,958
