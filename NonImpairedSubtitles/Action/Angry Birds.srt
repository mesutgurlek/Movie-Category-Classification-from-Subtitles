2
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:43,920
Okay, come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

3
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,453
Oh, boy. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go, buddy.

4
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:49,582
Come on. Come on.
We got to move. We got to move.

5
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,345
Whoa!

6
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:56,878
Oh...!

7
00:00:56,903 --> 00:00:58,966
Yes, yes, yes...
No, no, no...

8
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,377
Ahhh!

9
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:01,503
Aw!

10
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:07,533
Uh!
What!

11
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:08,617
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

12
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:11,547
Egg! Egg!
Got you.

13
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:15,370
Ow.
Ow.

14
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:18,230
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow.

15
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:21,533
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

16
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:35,515
Beak.
Wing.

17
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,663
Tail.
Ribs.

18
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,440
Giblets.

19
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:46,407
I'm flying.
No, still can't fly.

20
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,675
Notta dodbly leees.
(Not the top of my list.)

21
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,908
Breathe.
Breathe.

22
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:58,273
Bottom feeder.

23
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,194
Up... and over.

24
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:03,262
Woo.
Huh!

25
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,393
Ta-da!

26
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:08,443
No, no, no...

27
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:10,802
Look, it's okay.
I'm just a clown.

28
00:02:10,952 --> 00:02:13,224
Oh boy.
That's loud.

29
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:15,295
You're loud.
You're... very scared of me.

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,165
Here, come here.
No? Okay. No, never mind.

31
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,768
Uh.
Happy Hatchday.

32
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:20,343
Oh.
Hi, pal.

33
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:24,083
You must be so disappointed
in yourself for being this late.

34
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:25,736
Oh, no.
No. No, no, no.

35
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:27,136
I'm not late.
Look at the time.

36
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,483
See.
The order said, "Before noon."

37
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:33,197
Okay.
Now, you're late.

38
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:35,234
- What?
- Where have you been?

39
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:37,333
- It's funny you ask. I was...
- You missed the party.

40
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,898
- What is that?
- Oh, that.

41
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,342
Uh, yes.
I fell on the box.

42
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,828
Oh, the squirrel.
That's on us.

43
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:46,742
You know, I tried to keep my body
between the ground and the box,

44
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,532
but...
No, I think I got a little bruise.

45
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,284
You see anything back there?

46
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:52,354
Hear that, honey?
The clown we paid

47
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,028
to be here an hour ago,
fell on our son's hatchday cake.

48
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:58,704
That's why our son's hatchday
party is ruined.

49
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:00,827
- Oh.
- And the next time you messed up.

50
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:05,563
Don't tell me a story.
Just take responsibility.

51
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:07,299
Hey, man.
It wasn't a story.

52
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:09,785
I'm a screw up
that woke up late

53
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,359
and fell on the thing
you paid for!

54
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:14,938
It wasn't a story,
I almost drown.

55
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:19,029
Why don't we just settle this out
and say the cake's on you.

56
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:25,986
I'm sorry.
It's on me?

57
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:28,409
Well, who else will it be on?

58
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:31,971
Well, you know, I...

59
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:33,504
I'm not sure you're
going to like this.

60
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,860
Um...
but, since you asked.

61
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:39,141
Rather than being on me
as you suggested.

62
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:40,143
This cake...

63
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:41,899
... is on YOU!

64
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,092
So, you want to hear a story?

65
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:48,807
I run my butt off,
literally, mind you.

66
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:51,027
To get the "gluten free cake."

67
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:54,535
What the heck is gluten?
I mean, does gluten even exist?

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,488
Who are you?

69
00:03:56,513 --> 00:03:58,111
- Get out of here!
- Already.

70
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:00,696
But, you're the only one
that has cake.

71
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,168
Oh, that's good stuff.

72
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:05,393
Anybody want to eat some cake
off their dad or husband?

73
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:08,122
Who needs plates when
you got this guy's face, right?

74
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,691
Oh, oh, oh, mm.
Oh, wait. I almost forgot.

75
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:13,175
You know, I'm suppose to do a
quick customers satisfaction survey

76
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,744
before I... weet weet split, okay.

77
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:16,753
So, on a scale of 1 to 3 stars,

78
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:18,042
what would you say
about my performance.

79
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:19,734
And don't forget,
the squirrel was...

80
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:24,913
... free

81
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,237
- Sorry about this.
- No!

82
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:32,878
My bad.

83
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:34,981
Huh?

84
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:45,656
Congratulations!

85
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:46,916
- Huh?
- Oh...!

86
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:48,831
It's a boy.

87
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,084
Hey.
Eyebrows.

88
00:05:25,822 --> 00:05:27,268
Eyebrows.

89
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,591
- Eyebrows.
- Eyebrows.

90
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,091
- Eyebrows.
- Eyebrows.

91
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:04,203
Oh...

92
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:05,485
Hm.

93
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:10,975
Oh.

94
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:14,955
Oh.

95
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,431
Your Honor.

96
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:42,997
Our family has always practice
natural child attach,

97
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:46,846
the risk of having a scramble
infant are too great.

98
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:48,388
There is going to be music

99
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:52,253
The nest was going to be full
of beautiful fresh cut flowers.

100
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:55,749
And the first 2 faces
he was going to see

101
00:06:55,787 --> 00:07:00,405
were the loving faces of his
mother and his father.

102
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:04,652
We can never get that moment back.

103
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:09,016
Ma'am, I never wanted my face
to the first face your the baby saw.

104
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,862
What are we talking about here.
He probably doesn't even remember me.

105
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:14,187
Daddy!

106
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:16,002
No, no, no. No.
Shhh, shut up.

107
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,555
Shut up.
Cool it!

108
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:22,696
Ladies and gentlemen.
Am I a passionate bird?

109
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:25,089
Yes.
Guilty as can be.

110
00:07:25,114 --> 00:07:27,378
It was a quality cake.

111
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:31,410
Look, I worked very hard
to get it there, on time.

112
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:35,254
And he wouldn't even try it.

113
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,479
Mr. Red.

114
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:43,072
We are a happy happy bird community.
Under the protection of Mighty Eagle

115
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:46,416
We work, we play, we laugh.

116
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,441
We love and we live our lives
free from conflict and strife, sir.

117
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:53,040
We love the sound of our
own voice too, evidently.

118
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:56,491
Perhaps you've never heard the joke,
"Why don't birds fly?"

119
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:57,938
I'm going to tell you why.

120
00:07:57,963 --> 00:08:01,370
Because, where else
would we ever want to go?

121
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,400
- Wow. Not a good joke.
- It kills me every time, guys.

122
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:08,535
So now, what am I
to make of the likes of you.

123
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,990
There seems to be
a recurring issue here.

124
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:13,569
Anger.

125
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,181
I don't think I have an anger issue,
I think you got an anger issue.

126
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,764
- Oh.
- Oh.

127
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,689
Anger...

128
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:23,960
is a weed growing in our garden.

129
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:27,406
And what do you do
when you find a weed?

130
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,608
I don't know.
But I bet you're going to tell me.

131
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,601
You pluck it out!

132
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:33,439
Oh my gosh.

133
00:08:33,464 --> 00:08:34,901
Mr. Red.

134
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:37,481
When you moved your house
outside of our village,

135
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:40,681
did you notice that
nobody try to stop you?

136
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:43,496
Birds, they may smile
at you on the street

137
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:47,458
but, that doesn't mean
they like you.

138
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,226
Mm-Hm.

139
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:51,013
Hey, you know what?
I got a question for you.

140
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:54,869
Are you aware that, that robe
you're wearing isn't fooling anybody?

141
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:58,927
We all see you prancing
along the street, your Honor.

142
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:01,367
And, you're what?
And I'm just approximating here.

143
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:02,795
Like an inch tall!

144
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,098
You...
What are you doing?

145
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:06,588
- Viola.
- Ah-choo!

146
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,939
- What the?
- Daddy.

147
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:13,265
Mr. Red, given the
severity of the crimes,

148
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,877
I have no choice but to
impose the maximum penalty

149
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:20,375
allowed by the law.

150
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,721
Anger management class.

151
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:26,748
Aw.
Pluck my life.

152
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,713
- Fresh worms, caught today.
- Huh?

153
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:31,984
Hey, Red.
How are you?

154
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,253
Oh, I'm horrible.

155
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,560
Oh. Hi, Red.
It's good to see you.

156
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:37,642
I wish I could
say the same.

157
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,439
- Ups-a-daisy
- Aw! Ow.

158
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:41,895
Thank you.

159
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:45,018
Huh?

160
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:46,400
- Huh?
- Nm-mm.

161
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:48,677
- Let's go.
- Oh.

162
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:51,314
How are you, Suzie?
You good?

163
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:53,516
No running.
No running.

164
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:55,750
- Oop.
- Come on.

165
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:59,462
Hey.
How's that nap schedule coming along?

166
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:00,865
Oh boy.

167
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,346
Y'guys ever thought about bird control.

168
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:07,296
Left, right, left, right,
there you go.

169
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:13,240
Hi.
Hi.

170
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,663
Alright.
Oop!

171
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:24,216
Girlie. Girlie.
You got this.

172
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,778
We don't want you to fall now,
take your time.

173
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,996
Here we go.
That's it.

174
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,414
Oh, you're doing it.

175
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,859
- Seriously?
- I'm almost there.

176
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:42,154
<font color="#379bff">(HUG TRADER)</font>

Crane pose.

182
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,570
Wow.

183
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:09,252
Mighty Might Eagle soaring free.
Defender of our homes and liberty.

184
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:11,956
Hi, Red.
Is one of those yours?

185
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:13,122
What?

186
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:15,190
Yeah.
When birds fly.

187
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:18,037
Mighty Eagle is a legend.

188
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:05,109
You think that's funny.
Ha ha ha. This is funny.

189
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:08,487
Oh oh.

190
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:28,233
What?

191
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:49,946
Don't look, Bobby.

192
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:52,331
The anger might be contagious.

193
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,062
Let's go.

194
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:55,702
He started it.

195
00:12:58,284 --> 00:12:59,769
There you go.

196
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,738
Ah-hah.

197
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:16,880
Oh, look at this.
This is going to be awful.

198
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:21,020
Okay, I guess that's art.

199
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,478
That's garbage.

200
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:26,484
And that's,
exotic.

201
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:31,290
- Free rage what?
- Oh, hi.

202
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,761
- Hi, there. Welcome...
- Hello.

203
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:34,977
... to the Infinity Acceptance Group.

204
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:36,548
- I, am Matilda.
- Okay.

205
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:41,038
And I'm just super psych to be
taking this journey with you

206
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:43,363
Oh.
You're gonna have a blast!

207
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:47,013
I'm really fun.
Everybody says that about me.

208
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:49,965
Hey, guys.
Say hello to Red, everyone.

209
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,495
Hello.

210
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,879
Hi, Red.

211
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:54,956
Hello, birds I won't
get to know well.

212
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:57,493
Hey, apparently somebody didn't get
the memo that we like to start on time.

213
00:13:57,518 --> 00:13:59,461
Because you're about 2 minutes late,
don't let it happen again.

214
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:01,620
Hi, my name is Chuck. I'm sorry
we got off on the wrong foot.

215
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:03,456
I like you a lot.
I can tell.

216
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:05,187
Okay.
Now, Red.

217
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,474
Would you like to share
your story with us?

218
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,599
No.
Not really.

219
00:14:09,624 --> 00:14:12,741
Well, the court mentioned
something about a rage episode

220
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:15,292
at a child's birthday party.

221
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:17,219
How long is this class anyway?

222
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:19,618
As long as you make it.

223
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:21,120
Really?
Oh, okay.

224
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:23,324
Uh, gentlemen,
very nice to see you.

225
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,199
And uh, almost meet you.

226
00:14:25,224 --> 00:14:27,040
Probably the nicest part of it
is not getting to meet you.

227
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:28,225
You know,
in some weird away.

228
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,451
Alright.
So, I'm gonna go ahead and...

229
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:34,545
scoot on back out, past
those creepy statues and...

230
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,225
HAH!
Back you go.

231
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,140
Sure. No, I can...
take a seat.

232
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:40,408
So, in another sense,

233
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:43,386
you are here until I
notify the court

234
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:46,946
that your anger issues
have been resolved.

235
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:48,623
Oh boy.

236
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:51,157
Chuck!
Share your story with Red.

237
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,375
Me? I'm the last guy
that should be here.

238
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,714
Simple speeding ticket.

239
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:55,991
Judge tells me
I was going too fast,

240
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:58,652
So I say, "Your Honor.
To be honest. I was"

241
00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:00,837
You caught me.
I'm not angry. I'm honest.

242
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,324
So, shouldn't I be in an
honesty management class?

243
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,791
'Cause we got to
manage my honesty.

244
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:06,995
Mmf-hmm.

245
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,772
My one problem,

246
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:11,886
that's a different story
than you told last time.

247
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,578
Uh-uh...

248
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:37,507
<font color="#ff9933">Officer
Bill Beakins</font>

249
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:39,875
Drinks on me, guys!

250
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:48,758
Chuck...

251
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,806
Okay.
Maybe, it wasn't ice cream.

252
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:52,698
Alright, Chuck.
Thanks, we got it.

253
00:15:52,723 --> 00:15:56,305
And this is Terence.

254
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:59,218
Woof.
More like, terrifying

255
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:02,533
No.
It says here in the little filey.

256
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:19,836
Terence uh, seems to have an
incident.

257
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:23,219
Now, Bomb's started
with us 2 weeks ago

258
00:16:23,244 --> 00:16:26,201
Tell us your story, Bomb.

259
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:29,415
Okay.
Well, sometimes when I get upset,

260
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,454
I... have been known to...
blow up.

261
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,954
So, like uh. Like what?
Like you get mad, you mean.

262
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:39,972
Well. No.
I literally blow up, okay.

263
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:43,256
I explode like a bomb.

264
00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:49,350
Hence the name.

265
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:54,080
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

266
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:00,091
Excuse me.
Party foul.

267
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:01,280
Ow!

268
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,273
- Do it!
- No can do.

269
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:06,987
I just went boom-boom
before class.

270
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:08,331
Hey, look.
I don't want to be here and all,

271
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:10,613
but this can maybe make it
a little more interesting to me.

272
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:12,340
So.
Please, explode.

273
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,442
- You can't do it, can you?
- Yes, I can.

274
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,777
But, I'm having back issues today,
so...

275
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,219
I'm gonna have to
take a rain check.

276
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:20,607
Oh...
Do it!

277
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:22,359
This is not the time
or place, little amigo.

278
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:24,885
These guys are all nuts,
huh, big man?

279
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:30,462
Are we speaking telepathically
or you're just...

280
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,704
Good talk.

281
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:36,318
Nice chatting with you.

282
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:42,067
Managing our anger
through movement.

283
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:46,139
The first pose is
the dancer pose.

284
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,027
Great form, Terence.

285
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:50,138
Eagle. Parrot.
Peacock? Warrior.

286
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:52,236
Mountain. Tree. Rabbit.
Fish. Locust. King pigeon.

287
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:54,639
And of course, downward duck.

288
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:58,193
- Excuse me, boring heavy lady.
- Uh-huh.

289
00:17:58,218 --> 00:17:59,838
Looks like the exploding
guy's gonna puke.

290
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:01,639
And have you done this before?

291
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,274
Uh, yes, I have.
But, usually not for free.

292
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:05,547
- Didn't think so.
- Awesome.

293
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:07,123
And how are we doing over here, Bomb?

294
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:10,039
Doing wonderful.
Stretching out the core.

295
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:13,549
Just remember to breathe,
up to your feathers,

296
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:17,818
and from your talons.

297
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:19,239
Bomb?

298
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:25,268
Nice.

299
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,493
I don't know what happened

300
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:30,557
I was doing the poses.
I was feeling all zen.

301
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:32,348
Matilda was digging it!

302
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:33,846
Then I lost my grip on it.

303
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:36,058
I let it slipped and
it just squeaked out.

304
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,356
Hey.
So, where are we going?

305
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:38,894
I'm sorry.
We?

306
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:39,931
Yes, we

307
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:43,388
There's a new happiness exhibit
at the Museum of Happiness

308
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,155
that I'm dying to see.

309
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:47,580
Uh, you know what?
I... I mean I got a...

310
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,491
- I got a thing.
- A thing?

311
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:50,778
Like a disease?

312
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:52,709
Huh! Is it bird flu?
Chicken pox?

313
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,051
Huh!
Cardinal sin?

314
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:59,532
No. By thing, I mean like...
desire not to hang out, with you.

315
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:00,900
Oh.

316
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:02,778
Oh, yeah. Well, may... you know.
Maybe for the best, you know.

317
00:19:02,802 --> 00:19:05,451
Because... I got something too.

318
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:07,359
Ha!
How did I forget?

319
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:10,948
Even if you'd say yes,
I probably couldn't have gone.

320
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:16,787
I'm busy too,
I have a...

321
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:20,351
Business offer... deal
that is...

322
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:22,264
No, Bomb.
You're not good at this, buddy.

323
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:26,073
It's-It's charming up to a point
and now it's just sad.

324
00:19:26,877 --> 00:19:28,991
It's a guy I know.

325
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:35,865
And he's opening up a brand new
luxury class reunion.

326
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,329
Okay, good.
Good, good, good.

327
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:42,513
Looks like it's just us.
Want to go get a bite?

328
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:46,409
Oh, but what about your class reunion,
where everybody brings a business offer.

329
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:50,377
Oh. No, no, no.
Chuck, I was lying.

330
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,466
 I'm sorry if I've fooled you.

331
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,487
Nah-uh.
No means no.

332
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:03,111
I love your eye.

333
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,794
Cheers.

334
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:07,472
- Hey!
- Huh?

335
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,137
- Get over here!
- Hey, pecker heads.

336
00:20:11,162 --> 00:20:12,171
- What's up?
- Yo.

337
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:13,459
Hey, man.

338
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,931
Oh.

339
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:20,939
Oh.

340
00:20:20,964 --> 00:20:23,272
- Oh, I felt a peck.
- Whoa.

341
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,883
Ah...

342
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:44,341
This is the legendary Mighty Eagle.

343
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:49,268
Our protector and hero, but
no one has seen him for years.

344
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:52,174
Mighty Eagle is missing.

345
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:54,538
When's Mighty Eagle
going to come back.

346
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:56,828
Eyebrows, didn't your parents
ever tell you,

347
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,533
Mighty Eagle isn't real?

348
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,687
Shhh. He doesn't know that.
He doesn't have parents.

349
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:06,064
- He does not have parents.
- Yeah, or even friends.

350
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:56,724
Ah ha!
Eureka!

351
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:02,262
Say bye to daddy.

352
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,594
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

353
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,284
- Goodbye, hatchlings.
 - Bye!

354
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:07,329
- Have a happy day.
- Bye.

355
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:10,256
- Good morning.
- Morning, your Honor.

356
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:12,705
Here you go.

357
00:22:12,883 --> 00:22:15,115
- Ah-Choo!
- Bless you.

358
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,005
- Yes!
- Bye, daddy's making dinner.

359
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,169
If my name were Bobby,
would you ask about my hobbies.

360
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:30,330
- Wow
- Or if my name were Judas,

361
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:33,038
would you ask me
what my mood is?

362
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:36,675
I laugh, I cry,
I love, I hate.

363
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,494
I do so much more
than detonate.

364
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,140
Think of it

365
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:45,765
That was beautiful.

366
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,510
You're gonna make me cry.

367
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:50,198
Yeah, that was some real
clever symbolism.

368
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:53,035
Ah! Red, why don't
we hear you poem?

369
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,204
I don't have a poem.

370
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:55,835
Uh-huh.
Why not?

371
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,569
Because I didn't write one.

372
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:01,866
Right, uh-huh.
And, is there a reason?

373
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:03,292
Well. You know,
I was gonna do it,

374
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:04,891
but then I thought about it.

375
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,922
and I realized,
"Oh, this is a huge waste of my time."

376
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:09,611
So I didn't do it.

377
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:13,472
Deep breath. Deep breath.
DEEP BREATH!

378
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,769
And we're back in the now.
Chuck!

379
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:19,913
- You had your hand up the whole time.
- Um-Hm.

380
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:24,090
My poem,
is about a hate crimes

381
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:27,564
- How did it...?
- Oh oh.

382
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,840
Oh no.

383
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:32,066
A lot of sickos out there.
A lot of sickos.

384
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:36,611
What? Oh, what
did I make you of?

385
00:23:36,636 --> 00:23:38,346
- I made you out of love.
- Wow.

386
00:23:38,371 --> 00:23:41,799
But, wait. Too late.
Now I see your fate.

387
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:47,074
Some very troubled somebody
destroyed you out of hate.

388
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:54,864
What could have made him so despise
your happy smile, your laughing eyes.

389
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:58,259
Your soul was pure.
Your heart was true.

390
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:03,063
And someone hated that.
But, who?

391
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:04,522
Oh!

392
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:10,484
Terence.

393
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:13,840
Whoa!
<font color="#ff8080">[ HANG IN THERE ]</font>

394
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:16,156
Yeah, I deserve that.
Oh.

395
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:20,137
Billy has passed
to a high plane of existence.?

396
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:22,753
Everyone join wings.

397
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,377
Let us,
all say our goodbyes.

398
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:27,424
Yeah. Let me get in here,
I got to say goodbye...

399
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:28,740
Okay.

400
00:24:29,997 --> 00:24:32,392
Okay. You know, I'll just mourn
from back here, that's fine.

401
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,813
You know, if there is one thing
Billy always hated was goodbyes.

402
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:37,375
- Hey. What's going on there?
- Huh?

403
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:39,928
Class dismiss.

404
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:42,792
Very moving.

405
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:44,172
Come on, everybody.
Let's go!

406
00:24:44,197 --> 00:24:45,711
Hey.
Where's everybody going?

407
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:47,282
Hurry, something's coming!

408
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:49,942
- Last one to the beach is a rotten egg!
- Let's go.

409
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:52,132
Coming through. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

410
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,356
What?

411
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,759
Aw.
Again?

412
00:25:01,784 --> 00:25:03,729
Let's get down to the beach!

413
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:06,311
- Follow me.
- Let's get down to the beach.

414
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,293
What?

415
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:16,385
Huh?

416
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,831
I didn't mean to photo bomb you,
sorry about it

417
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:21,970
What is that thing?

418
00:25:21,995 --> 00:25:26,149
It looks like an UFO.
An unidentified floating object.

419
00:25:26,174 --> 00:25:27,770
Daddy!

420
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:30,592
Stop it.
No, I'm not your daddy.

421
00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:32,768
- What is that?
- Look at the size of that thing.

422
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:34,100
Where is it going?

423
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,537
I don't know,
but it's not stopping.

424
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:41,858
My house.
My house.

425
00:25:42,397 --> 00:25:44,837
Slow down!
Stop!

426
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:52,940
Oh.

427
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:57,135
Phew.

428
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,794
What the?

429
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,263
That house took me
5 years to build.

430
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:08,353
Wow.

431
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:12,803
It's such a shame when you create
something and someone just destroys it.

432
00:26:13,494 --> 00:26:16,506
Ladies and gentlemen.

433
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:19,702
- We have a very special guest for you.
- Huh?

434
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:22,541
- He's a green marine sailing machine.
- Here we go.

435
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:25,588
And he's king, to let you know,
he's not mean.

436
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:30,680
Put your wings together for
Leonard!

437
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:33,900
Oh.
Thank you very much.

438
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,550
Please hold your applause.

439
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:42,307
Greetings from my world,
the world of the pigs.

440
00:26:42,332 --> 00:26:44,071
What's a pig?

441
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,147
I am a pig!

442
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:54,253
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

443
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:58,107
Oh, where're we going?
Wrong way.

444
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:00,251
Oopsie.
Not working.

445
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:02,600
We practiced this a hundred times.

446
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:04,244
- Oh, man.
- Give it to me.

447
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,254
- Oh.
- We're gonna come in again.

448
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,896
I'm so sorry.

449
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:14,198
My name is Leonard,
but my friends call me Chuckles.

450
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:16,584
- Oh, ho ho ho! Very generous.
- Yeah.

451
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:17,597
- Thank y...
- Oh.

452
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:19,671
- We mean no harm.
- Aw. Ow.

453
00:27:19,696 --> 00:27:23,724
We saw your island across the sea
and we thought,

454
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:25,239
"I wonder what they're up to?"

455
00:27:25,264 --> 00:27:27,889
But, there's no other place
besides here.

456
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:30,990
Yes, there is.
And we are from there.

457
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:33,332
We call it, Piggy Island.

458
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:34,672
Oh my gosh.

459
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:38,634
P-I-GG-Y Island.

460
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,139
Who else is out there?

461
00:27:40,164 --> 00:27:43,395
My first officer, Ross and I
have sailed everywhere.

462
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,188
One brave soul against the sea,
and Ross.

463
00:27:47,213 --> 00:27:48,425
Ah, excuse me.

464
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,868
Have you come to smash
all of our houses or just mine?

465
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:55,291
- Oh, man.
- Ho ho. Somebody want a gift basket.

466
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:57,900
Please. Please.
Don't be afraid.

467
00:27:57,925 --> 00:28:01,469
My partner and I request
the honor of your friendship.

468
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:03,758
- Ross, show them how'd we do it.
- Oh?

469
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,062
Don't worry, he's always shy.

470
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:07,945
- Well, I'll say now.
- Hi! Uhh!

471
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,374
Hi, friends.

472
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,146
Oh, not a hugger.

473
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:17,394
Welcome to Bird Island.

474
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:20,610
Welcome to our new friends,
the Pigs.

475
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:23,793
- Let us have a celebration!
- Put it there!

476
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:25,281
- Welcome
- Oh.

477
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:26,507
What?
Sorry.

478
00:28:26,532 --> 00:28:27,698
And a hoof to a wing.

479
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:31,652
We would like to honor the pig's
with a special performance.

480
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:38,184
Oh, watch out.
Shaking my bacon.

481
00:28:38,209 --> 00:28:39,479
They don't have feathers?

482
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:42,767
You know, they're just walking around
naked just presenting themselves.

483
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:44,638
I'm looking at all
their business here.

484
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:46,345
That part about them,
I really admire.

485
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:50,178
Now we would like to welcome
our special guest, the PIGS!

486
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:52,061
- Yay.
- Alright.

487
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:55,072
Thank you for your kindness
and hospitality.

488
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:57,846
- Our king sends his warmest regards.
- King?

489
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:03,050
You have shared with us the wonders
of your quaint simple little island.

490
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,219
Drop the banner, Ross!

491
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:06,701
Ah!
Whoa!

492
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:11,179
Now, we would love to humbly share
some of the wonders of our world.

493
00:29:11,204 --> 00:29:13,331
Ha! Yeah.
Humble my bird butt.

494
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:14,397
Language.

495
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:17,207
100 years from now,
everyone will ask,

496
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:21,357
"How do the friendship between
the pigs and the birds start?"

497
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:22,644
Who cares!

498
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:24,112
- Oh no.
- Hey.

499
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,713
Well, let them say us,
"We lite up the night!"

500
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,538
Holy moley!

501
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:35,765
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!

502
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,717
Hey, look. They destroyed more of
the stuff we worked hard to build.

503
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:40,690
But, there's more!
- More?

504
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:42,726
Has gravity gone haywire?

505
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:47,805
No! Even better, your friends,
the pigs, proudly give you...

506
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,427
- The trampoline!
- Oh.

507
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:52,726
Those are my assistance.

508
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:55,533
- Oinky and John Ham!
- Hello.

509
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:58,944
Hey, hold on a second. I thought there's
only suppose to be 2 of these guys.

510
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:03,149
What goes?
Look at those jiggly pigglies!

511
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:07,247
But, that's not all, throwing things
just got a whole lot easier.

512
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,215
Say hello to...

513
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:12,148
- "The Slingshot!"
- Ta-da!

514
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,311
- I can't see.
- This is crazy.

515
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:14,868
Wow!

516
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:17,000
- Tired of carrying things from place to place?
- Yeah!

517
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,766
Wish you could just get it there?

518
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:19,836
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

519
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,511
Well, now you can!

520
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:22,953
- Waiters, do me a favor.
- Huh!

521
00:30:22,978 --> 00:30:24,481
- Take the rest of the night off.
- Okay.

522
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:27,154
Hey, if you got the night off
why don't you fix my house.

523
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,726
Yeah.
It's the same guy.

524
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:33,725
Well, the slingshot does it all
in 3 easy steps.

525
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,525
Ready.
Aim!

526
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,478
- Fire!
- I got it.

527
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:43,082
- Follow them fish!
- Me! Me! I want fruit!

528
00:30:43,186 --> 00:30:47,165
Guys. It's the same fruit sitting
on the plates in front of you.

529
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:52,245
And now, for our
last gift to you.

530
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,795
Shut up and fix my house!

531
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,825
We don't know him.

532
00:30:57,135 --> 00:31:01,022
I'm going to ask for a volunteer
from the audience.

533
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:02,052
- Me!
- Me!

534
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:03,714
Who should I pick?

535
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,399
- Who, who, who.
- Pick me, Mr. Pig.

536
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:08,219
How about the red guy,
with the enormous eyebrows?

537
00:31:08,244 --> 00:31:09,296
- Aw.
- Ha ha ha ha.

538
00:31:09,321 --> 00:31:11,129
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

539
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:12,914
Oh. No, no, no, no.

540
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:16,473
Yes, you sir. Come on
up here it's your lucky day.

541
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:17,967
Are you sure you don't
want to choose

542
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:19,640
one of the 100s of birds
that had their wings up?

543
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:22,833
- Get him up here!
- Come on, Red. Have some fun!

544
00:31:22,858 --> 00:31:24,599
- Go!
- Go!

545
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:26,796
Oh, he's shy.

546
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:28,816
You hear that?
They're cheering for you!

547
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:30,201
Uh.
You got to be kidding me.

548
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:32,274
Red guy with the eyebrows!

549
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,050
I would have sat closer
had I known.

550
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:35,888
that I was going to be
part of the show.

551
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,000
- Okay. Now what?
- Come on, give him a hand.

552
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,971
Right this way, come on.
Relax, deep breathe.

553
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:42,977
Ready!

554
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:44,129
Who? Me?
Yeah. No. I'm ready.

555
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,625
- Aim!
- Aim at what?

556
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,873
Everybody on this one.

557
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:49,221
- Fire!
- Fire!

558
00:31:50,597 --> 00:31:52,623
Who says birds don't fly

559
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:54,665
This seems really unnatural!

560
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,148
- Huh!
- Aw. I hope he's okay.

561
00:31:57,173 --> 00:31:58,406
Ow.

562
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,441
Hey, don't worry.
I'm fine.

563
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:09,056
Thanks for the lift!

564
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:11,779
I wished they would have
done that 10 minutes ago.

565
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,677
Huh.

566
00:32:16,512 --> 00:32:18,833
You know you want to
search their boat.

567
00:32:18,858 --> 00:32:21,360
What?
No, I don't.

568
00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:23,284
Yeah, you're right, I do.

569
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:27,330
Bomb's on his way.
Mm. Mmm.

570
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:30,107
Come on.
Let's go!

571
00:32:30,132 --> 00:32:32,615
And remember, keep it quiet.

572
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:36,197
Oh, yeah.

573
00:32:38,412 --> 00:32:40,081
Whoa!
This is an impressive ship.

574
00:32:40,106 --> 00:32:43,114
Shh. No. Inside voice.
Inside voice. Come on.

575
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:45,434
Sorry.

576
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,122
Piggy fitness.

577
00:32:48,147 --> 00:32:49,241
- Mm?
- Nmm?

578
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:50,483
Mm-hm.

579
00:32:52,949 --> 00:32:55,215
<font color="#80ff80">FIFTY SHADES
OF GREEN</font>

580
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:03,501
Very strange.

581
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,469
- Huh?
- Aw!

582
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:11,160
Who are these weirdos?
Huh?

583
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,193
What are you doing,
we're trying to sneak around.

584
00:33:18,218 --> 00:33:19,516
We didn't rent this place out.

585
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,745
Wow, you can rent this place?

586
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,470
- Hm.
- Give me that!

587
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,234
- Huh!
- Huh!

588
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:29,829
Hey, guys!

589
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:35,262
Looks like there's some more
stuff down here.

590
00:33:40,388 --> 00:33:42,010
We were hiding.

591
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,229
When I say "Hey."
You say "Ho."

592
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:49,013
- Hey!
- Ho!

593
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:50,460
- Hey!
- Ho!

594
00:33:50,485 --> 00:33:51,731
- Hey!
- Ho!

595
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:53,534
There's more of them!

596
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:56,223
- Hey!
- Ho...!

597
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:58,557
That's right.
I'm back, uh-huh.

598
00:33:58,582 --> 00:34:00,199
Enjoying the party, everyone?

599
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:05,588
Because while you were living it up,
I snuck up onto their boat.

600
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:07,191
- What!
- What did he say?

601
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:10,035
And look at what I found.

602
00:34:10,245 --> 00:34:12,466
There's more of them!
Than we thought.

603
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,488
Which is uh... mysterious and weird.
Am I right?

604
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:16,894
Ho ho ho ho.
Ho ho.

605
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:18,412
Hi.

606
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:19,977
- How're you doing?
- Oh.

607
00:34:20,002 --> 00:34:23,055
You remember. He said there
were only 2 pigs on board,

608
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,216
- but he was obviously lying.
- Hmm.

609
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:29,451
Oh, and there's strange
devices on their boat!

610
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:32,306
So clearly there's... you know,
some messed up stuff going on here.

611
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:33,803
How messed up?
I don't know

612
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:36,060
What's specifically?
I don't know either.

613
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:37,965
Any questions?

614
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,533
You snuck onto their boat?

615
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:44,519
You know.
I don't need a award.

616
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:46,965
If you guys are trying to think of
what honor to bestow upon me

617
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,563
- Don't need it.
- Boo!

618
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:49,978
Yeah, boo them.

619
00:34:50,003 --> 00:34:51,407
- Boo.
- Boo.

620
00:34:51,432 --> 00:34:52,810
- You're booing them or me?
- You.

621
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:54,217
Oh, it's me.

622
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:56,867
Perhaps, I can explain.

623
00:34:56,892 --> 00:35:00,473
You see, my cousins
are simple folk.

624
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:04,509
Watch.
A, B, C...

625
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:07,124
Nothing.
See, nothing.

626
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:08,926
I didn't want to risk their lives

627
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,484
until I found out that the...
the new world was safe.

628
00:35:12,508 --> 00:35:15,330
We were gonna put on
a cowboy show for you.

629
00:35:15,355 --> 00:35:19,233
Let her go, boys!
Yee-haw!

630
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,592
- Ha ha, yeah!
- Yoo!

631
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:24,066
Shhh.

632
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,528
 . . ..

633
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:28,054
- That was Pigleand.
- Oh.

634
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,663
But perhaps,
it wasn't meant to be.

635
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,413
Oh.

636
00:35:31,438 --> 00:35:35,593
I believe that birds and pigs
are meant to be friends.

637
00:35:35,618 --> 00:35:40,404
But if we crossed boundaries
that were not meant to be crossed...

638
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,321
- Oh.
- Oh.

639
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:45,252
Mr. Red,
you shamed not only yourself,

640
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,372
but our entire community.

641
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:48,809
Oh, I think you messed up there.

642
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:50,886
You said shamed when
you meant saved, right?

643
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:54,304
I sent you to treatment
to deal with your problems.

644
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:56,937
Clearly, more treatment is required.

645
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:58,339
- No!
- No!

646
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,838
Do not trouble
our honored guests again!

647
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:06,701
My friends, we would love
to see your cowboy show.

648
00:36:06,726 --> 00:36:09,642
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

649
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,010
Come on, everybody!
Put your hands together!

650
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:13,122
- Woo-Hoo!
- Yeah!

651
00:36:13,147 --> 00:36:15,024
Whatever.
Don't listen to me.

652
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:17,949
Body train coming through.
Choo-choo.

653
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:29,632
Ah! I can't see.
I can't see.

654
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,222
Whoa!

655
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:51,813
- This is fun!
- Piggyback rides?

656
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:53,795
Yee-haw!
Let's move it there.

657
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,740
Oh boy.

658
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:56,725
Group picture.
Group picture.

659
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,229
Everybody say cheese.

660
00:36:58,254 --> 00:36:59,355
-Cheese...
- Cheese.

661
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,766
- ... omelet.
- Cheese omelet.

662
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,221
Woo.
Spoiler alert.

663
00:37:05,246 --> 00:37:06,972
- Hello.
- Jump!

664
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:19,409
- I am famish... Whoa.
- It's chow time!

665
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:24,660
Yuck.

666
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:28,408
Hanging tough through thick and thin.

667
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,164
Yeah!

668
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,830
Ow!

669
00:37:35,594 --> 00:37:36,977
What?

670
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:44,822
What the heck?

671
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,393
Who invited you to move in?

672
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:49,767
Hey! Whoa!
That's my toothbrush.

673
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:51,092
Get it out!

674
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:53,706
- Woo!
- Yee-haw!

675
00:37:57,298 --> 00:37:58,573
Huh?

676
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:07,023
Alright, class.
Thought for the day.

677
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:08,964
"Water is the softest thing,

678
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:12,929
yet it can penetrate
mountains and earth.

679
00:38:12,954 --> 00:38:14,867
Here's my thought of the day,
"When are we done?"

680
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,141
Aw.
Red.

681
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:20,390
What the caterpillar calls the end,
the world calls a butterfly.

682
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:24,219
Can I just say, I never understand
a single thing you are talking about.

683
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:33,130
Wow, that's very life like.

684
00:38:33,155 --> 00:38:35,207
Ah...!
Ha ha!

685
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:37,308
- Woo. Ho ho ho.
- So deep.

686
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,942
And Terence, let's see your...

687
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:43,036
Oh, my goodness.

688
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:45,684
I did not know
you felt that way.

689
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:46,955
Uh.
Class dismiss.

690
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,927
And now, we've come
to the prestigious Palm Cistern.

691
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:53,351
Where birds of all feathers
flock together

692
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:55,757
for the 8 kinds of
fruit and nut trees.

693
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:58,211
Suck those bellies in.
Instaham!

694
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,713
Hmm.
Is that what I think it is?

695
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,890
That's an egg.
That's how our children are born.

696
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:06,505
You guys don't lay eggs?

697
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,762
Aye.
Wished we did.

698
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:13,668
Enchanté.

699
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:19,378
You look delicious, my dear.

700
00:39:30,656 --> 00:39:32,598
That's us.

701
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:38,465
Hey! Hello!
Excuse me. Buddy?

702
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,661
Those are fragile.

703
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:41,561
Maybe you shouldn't pick them up, alright?
Not yours.

704
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:44,592
Oh.
My friend from the banquet.

705
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,332
Now that's a very good painting.
Very good.

706
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:48,518
Oh.
Yeah uh.

707
00:39:48,543 --> 00:39:52,669
The assignment was, "Paint your pain."
So I... painted your pain.

708
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:54,890
It's actually the first
in a series.

709
00:39:54,915 --> 00:39:56,362
- Here you go.
- Uh-huh.

710
00:39:56,387 --> 00:39:58,010
- This one is nice.
- Oh.

711
00:39:58,042 --> 00:40:00,773
I call this one, "Ketosis."

712
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:04,624
And, oh, I call this one,
"Bye bye."

713
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:06,251
Wonderful likeness.

714
00:40:06,276 --> 00:40:09,159
I thought you said you stored
your nuts for winter

715
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:11,275
- Ha ha ha...
- Burn.

716
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,517
Alright, what's going on here?

717
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:14,674
Are you explorers
or are you staying?

718
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:17,929
Because if you are explorers, then
why are there more of you coming, huh?

719
00:40:17,954 --> 00:40:20,037
Hi there, everybody!

720
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,858
Not my house again.
Tha-That's my home.

721
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,384
And you know what?
If you are staying,

722
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,389
why don't you just say so?
And why did you leave your home?

723
00:40:29,414 --> 00:40:31,651
How do we know you're not
fugitives of the law?

724
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:34,181
You are making our guests
feel unwelcome.

725
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:36,303
And you're not asking
basic questions!

726
00:40:36,328 --> 00:40:40,186
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.
Your opinion is not needed!

727
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:41,354
Why do we have to agree?

728
00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:42,936
Why does it matter that
we're not the same?

729
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:46,186
Anger, is not always the answer!

730
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:47,665
Continue the tour.

731
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,512
Umm.
Surfs up, you guys.

732
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:53,049
- So, get ready to hang loose.
- That went well, if you're me.

733
00:40:53,074 --> 00:40:54,363
Ha ha ha...

734
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:55,798
Dummy.

735
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:02,629
We could really use you
right about now.

736
00:41:03,258 --> 00:41:04,806
Wait.
Actually...

737
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:08,768
Hey, Chuck.
It's Red, zip on down here.

738
00:41:10,145 --> 00:41:14,089
Oh. Hey, Chuck's mom,
can your son come out to play?

739
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:18,242
All of this, does not
just happen on it's own.

740
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:22,382
BOMB'S
SHELTER

741
00:41:22,582 --> 00:41:25,327
Oh, hey.
Just taking a shower.

742
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,410
- Bomb, buddy, TMI.
- Ah ha ha!

743
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:31,144
Now, I'm telling you.
Something isn't kosher with these pigs.

744
00:41:31,169 --> 00:41:33,691
And it's up to us
to figure it out.

745
00:41:33,716 --> 00:41:35,272
Figure what out exactly?

746
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:37,092
I don't know.
Maybe they are just being innovative.

747
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:39,697
- Go ahead.
- All aboard.

748
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:42,442
It does seem a little odd though.

749
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:46,964
- Weee!
- Nailed it.

750
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:48,709
Flawless.

751
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:51,792
Come on. Does none of this
seem wrong to you guys?

752
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:54,841
I'll tell you this, if anyone knows
what these pigs are up to,

753
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:57,085
- Hey!
- it's Mighty Eagle.

754
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,419
MIGHTY EAGLE!

755
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:02,975
Oh yeah.

756
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:13,815
Take that, tree.

757
00:42:13,918 --> 00:42:15,691
Eat my foot.

758
00:42:17,261 --> 00:42:19,569
Tasty.
Yum yum yum.

759
00:42:22,198 --> 00:42:23,234
Whoa.

760
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:26,202
MIGHTY EAGLE!

761
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,972
Peek-a-boo.

762
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,704
Hello, Bird Island!

763
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:39,913
Mighty Eagle xo
- Heh heh, you're welcome.

764
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:43,554
- Does Mighty Eagle still live?
- Did he ever lived.

765
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:45,193
And if he did live,
where would he live?

766
00:42:45,218 --> 00:42:48,054
By the Lake of Wisdom
in the ancient tree.

767
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:49,237
It's a fairy tale.

768
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:51,874
I've run all over this island,
where could that possibly be?

769
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:54,303
Way up high.

770
00:42:56,013 --> 00:43:00,119
It's a long up that mountain,
and if I'm being honestly...

771
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,234
Well. I mean, you know,
I can kind of use your help.

772
00:43:02,258 --> 00:43:03,953
What's that?
What are you trying to say?

773
00:43:03,978 --> 00:43:06,699
Nothing. I was just saying that I can
you know, I can use your help.

774
00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:09,145
Oh. I'm sorry, I couldn't quite
hear you over your ego.

775
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,140
Could you enunciate
that last word a little bit.

776
00:43:11,165 --> 00:43:12,563
I need your help!

777
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:15,373
Oh.
Why didn't you say so?

778
00:43:15,413 --> 00:43:18,514
- Bomb?
- Let's... do it!

779
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:22,880
Oh gosh.

780
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:24,692
If there is a Mighty Eagle,

781
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:27,335
well, how come we don't
ever hear his battle cry?

782
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,488
- I don't know.
- Maybe we have.

783
00:43:29,513 --> 00:43:32,095
What would a Mighty Eagle
battle cry sound like?

784
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,457
You know what?
I think I got an idea.

785
00:43:33,482 --> 00:43:35,348
Maybe it's something like...

786
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,079
No!
That's more like...

787
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:43,105
That's theoretically what
it's more like, scientifically.

788
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,374
Oh, I got one.

789
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:50,701
Not bad.
It's a good impression.

790
00:43:50,726 --> 00:43:54,291
But, in my head, I'm kind of
imagining something more like a...

791
00:44:01,293 --> 00:44:02,572
That sounds about right.

792
00:44:02,597 --> 00:44:04,723
No. I'm thinking it maybe
it's a little bit more subtle.

793
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:07,393
Like a little bit,
just more majestic like...

794
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:24,472
- I'm cAlling for yOu!
- I'm coming foR You so OpeN your door!

795
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:27,327
Stop making Mighty Eagle noises!

796
00:44:27,352 --> 00:44:30,329
It's like running a nursery.
Absolute childcare.

797
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:34,296
Someone has anger issues.

798
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:42,641
This uh.
This is the wrong mountain.

799
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,455
My calves are killing me.

800
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,185
Aw!

801
00:45:13,353 --> 00:45:15,093
- Oh, wow.
- Whoa.

802
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:17,689
That is simply unreal.

803
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,872
The Lake of Wisdom.

804
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,830
What are you guys waiting for?

805
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:29,253
Guys, hurry up!

806
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:33,007
This is what Mama talked about.

807
00:45:33,758 --> 00:45:35,675
Wow.

808
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:42,903
Ah. Be honest.
Do I sound any wiser?

809
00:45:42,928 --> 00:45:44,694
Oh, way wiser.

810
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:46,913
You were kind of dumb before,
I can say that now.

811
00:45:46,938 --> 00:45:48,691
That water is no joke.

812
00:45:48,716 --> 00:45:52,261
I can literally taste the
intelligence and wisdom...

813
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:55,040
- ... circulating through my body now.
- Hey, guys. Nobody's here.

814
00:45:55,065 --> 00:45:57,812
I mean, nobody's used
this place in years.

815
00:45:58,995 --> 00:46:00,751
What are you doing?

816
00:46:01,421 --> 00:46:03,265
Get out of there!

817
00:46:10,097 --> 00:46:11,701
Aww.

818
00:46:13,088 --> 00:46:14,848
Don't spit in his mouth!

819
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:17,216
No, don't spit it back!

820
00:46:17,454 --> 00:46:19,324
Uh, don't swallow it.

821
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:21,821
Ew.
Ack.

822
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:31,912
Whoa!

823
00:46:33,528 --> 00:46:35,653
Get out. Let's go.
Come on.

824
00:46:35,678 --> 00:46:37,843
Shh, shh, Bomb.
Take your time, will you.

825
00:46:37,868 --> 00:46:39,476
Red.
I found the meaning of life.

826
00:46:39,501 --> 00:46:41,787
- It's...
- Shut your worm hole!

827
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:05,593
Oh, wow, it's him.

828
00:47:30,163 --> 00:47:31,870
Oh man.

829
00:47:39,847 --> 00:47:43,806
No, no, no.
Ack!

830
00:47:44,874 --> 00:47:47,945
 Horrible turn of events, horrible.

831
00:48:03,312 --> 00:48:04,547
Well.

832
00:48:04,572 --> 00:48:07,623
Not so much the Lake of Wisdom,
it's more like the Lake of Wizz.

833
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:11,181
Did you just come here
to look at me?

834
00:48:11,206 --> 00:48:14,896
Or did you have
something to say?

835
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:18,248
- I think he saw us.
- Oh, you think so?

836
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:22,253
You have passed the first test!

837
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:24,054
You have found me.

838
00:48:24,094 --> 00:48:25,294
- Whoa!
- Look out. Whoa!

839
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,126
Behold.
Gaze upon.

840
00:48:29,151 --> 00:48:33,439
Mighty Eagle!

841
00:48:36,225 --> 00:48:40,308
I see all and know all.

842
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,658
- What are your names?
- If you know all,

843
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:44,540
why don't you know where we are?

844
00:48:44,565 --> 00:48:45,578
Ow!

845
00:48:45,603 --> 00:48:48,004
I know very well
who you are.

846
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:53,000
You are lost souls, who have
come here, seeking wisdom.

847
00:48:53,025 --> 00:48:55,255
- Whoa!
- Can we have some?

848
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,347
Wisdom is not something
that is given.

849
00:48:59,372 --> 00:49:02,475
It is something that is...
attain.

850
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,929
Okay.
Goodbye.

851
00:49:03,954 --> 00:49:07,277
No no no...
Will I help you attain wisdom?

852
00:49:07,302 --> 00:49:08,909
- Whoa! Ha ha!
- Yes!

853
00:49:08,934 --> 00:49:10,955
That, I will do.

854
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,554
Right. So, the reason we've climbed
the mountain is that we want to know...

855
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:15,590
- Prepare!
- Okay.

856
00:49:15,615 --> 00:49:18,900
... to have your minds Blown.

857
00:49:18,925 --> 00:49:20,478
Aw!
Son of a...

858
00:49:20,503 --> 00:49:22,644
This guy is good.

859
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:25,948
Welcome, to the Hall of Heroism.

860
00:49:25,973 --> 00:49:28,801
Wow.
It's really amazing to meet you.

861
00:49:28,826 --> 00:49:30,788
You know, I actually
have your poster up uh...

862
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:35,172
You might want to shield your eyes
from the sprinkle of those trophies.

863
00:49:35,197 --> 00:49:36,818
How many?
I have no idea.

864
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:38,813
Countless, I'm sure.
13.

865
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:42,052
Wow. This is way nicer than
my Hall of Wimpiness.

866
00:49:42,077 --> 00:49:44,568
Bring it home, mamacita.

867
00:49:44,724 --> 00:49:47,345
Get out of town.
Ha ha ha ha!

868
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,914
What the?

869
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:59,001
Those are some
old school moves there.

870
00:49:59,026 --> 00:50:00,732
Yeah.

871
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,071
What?

872
00:50:06,096 --> 00:50:07,416
...
Wow.

873
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:09,222
YES!

874
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:10,391
Yeah.

875
00:50:13,297 --> 00:50:15,006
So, he's kind of a wackadoodle.

876
00:50:15,031 --> 00:50:17,551
That, you know,
it doesn't mean he's not wise.

877
00:50:20,115 --> 00:50:23,171
Hey. Are you tired of filling
your balloons with heavy old air?

878
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:25,379
Finally, there's a better way.

879
00:50:25,404 --> 00:50:26,595
- Helium.
- Helium.

880
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,378
It's a gas.

881
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,716
Aw.
Don't worry about your balloon.

882
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:34,690
It will just land in the ocean.
The fish love it.

883
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:37,093
It's good for their tummy.

884
00:50:40,507 --> 00:50:42,226
Free party.
Free party.

885
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:45,307
It's going to be the
piggiest party of the year.

886
00:50:45,491 --> 00:50:47,665
Party!
Get a bird sitter.

887
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,296
Let's go, piggies.

888
00:50:49,321 --> 00:50:52,030
Well now, that,
is some fine handy work.

889
00:50:52,055 --> 00:50:54,203
- Hey, judge, you're under arrest.
- What?

890
00:50:54,229 --> 00:50:55,885
For looking too good.

891
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:57,136
Hello.
What about me?

892
00:50:57,161 --> 00:50:59,943
Do I get a plus one?
Oh! Thank you.

893
00:50:59,968 --> 00:51:01,571
Let me see.
Let me see.

894
00:51:01,596 --> 00:51:04,258
Ah-choo!
Oh, that was a wet one.

895
00:51:10,657 --> 00:51:12,803
- Ooo.
- Ooo.

896
00:51:12,828 --> 00:51:16,008
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

897
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,562
Almost there.
Don't rush me.

898
00:51:19,712 --> 00:51:23,076
- Oop. Slow down there.
- Deep breath. Deep breath.

899
00:51:24,341 --> 00:51:26,054
And we're back.
And now...

900
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,771
Who's ready for trust falls?

901
00:51:27,803 --> 00:51:29,516
- I got you.
- No no no no no.

902
00:51:33,224 --> 00:51:37,413
Mighty Mighty Eagle soaring free.

903
00:51:37,438 --> 00:51:41,928
Defender of our homes and liberty.

904
00:51:41,953 --> 00:51:46,503
Bravery, humility, and honesty.

905
00:51:46,528 --> 00:51:50,496
You must have grown up
singing this song in school.

906
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:53,025
Uhh.
Yeah.

907
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:56,650
- Yes, we did.
- Um. Right. Yeah.

908
00:51:56,796 --> 00:52:03,273
Mighty, Mighty Eagle, rescue me.

909
00:52:03,298 --> 00:52:05,506
Now you do the second verse.

910
00:52:05,531 --> 00:52:07,691
- Uh. I.. I...
- Come on.

911
00:52:07,716 --> 00:52:09,424
- Me?
- Yes.

912
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:12,156
Do it.

913
00:52:12,181 --> 00:52:16,186
- Mighty, Mighty Eagle flap your wings.
- Oh yeah!

914
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:19,847
And fill up your big cave
with all your fancy things.

915
00:52:19,872 --> 00:52:20,757
That's it.

916
00:52:20,782 --> 00:52:23,177
- Politeness, Good sportsmanship.
- That's no me.

917
00:52:23,202 --> 00:52:25,197
- and the long attention span.
- What?

918
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:29,453
Mighty, Mighty Eagle, yeah.

919
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:31,278
Take it away, Charles.

920
00:52:31,303 --> 00:52:35,267
Oh great heroic Mighty Eagle.

921
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:37,718
With finer plumage

922
00:52:37,743 --> 00:52:40,878
- ... than a sea gull.
- Oh, sing it.

923
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:46,691
Uh.
Ambidexterity, pottery,

924
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:49,001
- ... and bankruptcy
- Ouch.

925
00:52:49,026 --> 00:52:53,401
Mighty, Mighty Eagle...
Harmonize. Harmonize.

926
00:52:53,426 --> 00:52:58,877
- Rescue me.
- Rescue me.

927
00:53:03,418 --> 00:53:06,369
Wow.
You know it better than me.

928
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:10,548
So, anyway, the other day,
these pigs showed up out of nowhere.

929
00:53:10,573 --> 00:53:13,142
And, it caused me
a great deal of suspicion.

930
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:15,588
And he's walking
out of the room.

931
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:17,202
Unbelie...
I don't get this.

932
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:19,181
This guy sits here on
his butt, all alone.

933
00:53:19,206 --> 00:53:20,689
clearly doesn't leave the house.

934
00:53:20,714 --> 00:53:23,893
He talk's a good game, but, he
doesn't care about anyone but himself.

935
00:53:23,918 --> 00:53:25,517
Sounds a lot like you.

936
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:28,704
Oh good.
Thank you for your opinion, Chuck.

937
00:53:32,534 --> 00:53:33,816
Well, hello.

938
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:36,318
- Hello. Mighty Eagle.
- What?

939
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:37,904
- What are you doing?
- Uh.

940
00:53:37,929 --> 00:53:40,671
- I am bird watching.
- What?

941
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:42,810
- Ah.
- Take a peek.

942
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:48,176
- Oh you're disgusting
- Oh yeah.

943
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,217
Look.
Are you gonna help us or not?

944
00:53:50,242 --> 00:53:52,598
- I am helping you!
- No. This is you helping.

945
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:54,983
Looking through binoculars.
Spying on old ladies.

946
00:53:55,008 --> 00:53:56,731
Whoa, whoa.
What is that?

947
00:53:57,845 --> 00:53:59,569
Wait.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

948
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:03,345
Oh my.

949
00:54:03,554 --> 00:54:06,080
Huh!
I was right.

950
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:07,686
I was right.
I knew it!

951
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,471
Bomb, Chuck, hurry up!
Get out here!

952
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,577
Oh oh.

953
00:54:10,602 --> 00:54:13,613
Mighty Eagle, hey.
Fly us down there, now.

954
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:19,736
- No.
- I'm sorry. What?

955
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:22,080
I don't do that anymore.
I'm retired.

956
00:54:22,105 --> 00:54:23,528
Mostly just tired.

957
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:24,743
Go handle it yourself.

958
00:54:24,774 --> 00:54:27,927
This is everything
I've prepared you for.

959
00:54:27,952 --> 00:54:29,560
What?
Prepared us for?

960
00:54:29,585 --> 00:54:30,911
Hold on.
Did I missed something?

961
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:32,846
Let me just go through
my notes really quick. Let's see.

962
00:54:32,871 --> 00:54:35,340
Crazy stuff, bragging,
crazy stuff, karaoke.

963
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:37,900
No. See, I don't see
anything useful here.

964
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:41,198
The whole world,
everyone we know, is in danger.

965
00:54:41,223 --> 00:54:42,806
Yes, it is.

966
00:54:42,831 --> 00:54:45,803
- So, off you go.
- Hey. You know what?

967
00:54:46,468 --> 00:54:48,773
I used to believe in you.

968
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:53,093
When I was a kid, I believed
nothing really bad could ever happen

969
00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:54,706
because you were here.

970
00:54:54,731 --> 00:54:58,889
And now I see the fate of
the world hangs on idiots like me.

971
00:54:58,914 --> 00:55:02,873
And that, sir,
is sort of terrifying.

972
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:05,322
It's time for you to go.

973
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:08,757
You know, it's really upsetting to me
that you're the only bird that can fly.

974
00:55:08,782 --> 00:55:10,755
And you're too afraid to do it.

975
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,534
- Huh!
- Huh?

976
00:55:12,565 --> 00:55:14,881
Hey, guys. Come on, let's go.
We're done here. He's no hero.

977
00:55:14,906 --> 00:55:17,086
So, uh, I'm having
a party next Tuesday.

978
00:55:17,111 --> 00:55:19,517
Could you just
do a little pop in?

979
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:26,396
Come on, run faster!

980
00:55:26,421 --> 00:55:27,383
- Whoa!
- Ah!

981
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:29,280
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Whoa!

982
00:55:32,156 --> 00:55:34,213
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Let's go!

983
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:37,172
- Woo!
- Yeah!

984
00:55:37,613 --> 00:55:38,713
- Woo.
- Woo.

985
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:40,664
I love this song.

986
00:55:44,944 --> 00:55:49,168
I sentence you all
to 4 hours of hard partying.

987
00:55:51,497 --> 00:55:53,159
Watch out below!

988
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:54,343
- Huh?
- Huh?

989
00:55:54,368 --> 00:55:57,940
- Huh! They're taking the eggs!
- Follow them.

990
00:55:58,973 --> 00:56:00,393
Gangway!

991
00:56:04,243 --> 00:56:06,090
Oh man.

992
00:56:14,225 --> 00:56:19,532
Right on time. Excellent.
Ah ha ha... !

993
00:56:19,557 --> 00:56:21,637
Chuck, go shut
that party down, now!

994
00:56:21,662 --> 00:56:24,713
Ee. But I only know
how to get party started.

995
00:56:24,738 --> 00:56:26,040
- Go!
- On it.

996
00:56:26,065 --> 00:56:28,423
- Bomb, we got to stop them.
- Yeah!

997
00:56:32,941 --> 00:56:35,311
Got to get more speeeeed!

998
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,909
Ah!
Whoa!

999
00:56:37,934 --> 00:56:40,400
It's Chuck time!

1000
00:56:40,992 --> 00:56:42,891
Get to the ship!

1001
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:48,213
Eggs.

1002
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:55,682
Can everybody please stop partying?
There are eggs being stolen!

1003
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,160
Matilda, we need your help.

1004
00:56:59,185 --> 00:57:01,204
- The pigs are stealing our eggs!
- What?

1005
00:57:01,229 --> 00:57:04,027
- I'm airborne!
- We have to get back to the village!

1006
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:04,716
Whoa!

1007
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:07,850
Stop dancing and start running!

1008
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:10,670
Huh!
Hors d'oeuvres, my weakness.

1009
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:13,219
Come on, let's wrap it up.

1010
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:15,419
- We got to get the eggs off the ship!
- Yeah, let's go!

1011
00:57:15,444 --> 00:57:16,943
- Is everyone on board?
- Let's go. Let's go!

1012
00:57:16,968 --> 00:57:19,033
Use the trampolines!

1013
00:57:20,496 --> 00:57:21,870
Can you get up there?

1014
00:57:21,895 --> 00:57:23,425
We got an intruder!

1015
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:24,973
What the heck are they doing?

1016
00:57:24,998 --> 00:57:27,149
Untie the ropes.
Drop the eggs in the water.

1017
00:57:27,174 --> 00:57:30,783
Get rid of them.
Get him off of there.

1018
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:33,286
It's too strong,
I can't break it.

1019
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:35,899
Huh!
Bomb, blow off the chain.

1020
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:37,841
Knock them down!

1021
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:40,849
Come on, Bomb.
You can do this.

1022
00:57:43,238 --> 00:57:44,817
Come on, Bomb.
You got this.

1023
00:57:44,842 --> 00:57:46,940
- Blow up.
- You got to get me mad.

1024
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:48,804
Okay. Well then,
what makes you mad?

1025
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:51,551
Try insulting me
on a personal level.

1026
00:57:51,578 --> 00:57:54,229
Oh, oh, uh.
Your poetry stinks!

1027
00:57:54,254 --> 00:57:56,515
You're just a bad poet.
And you know it!

1028
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,134
Oh. I know.
I know!

1029
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:01,625
Hey.
Who wants a birdie bath?

1030
00:58:09,465 --> 00:58:11,561
Oh. I'm sorry, Red.
I couldn't do it.

1031
00:58:11,586 --> 00:58:13,397
Don't give up.
This isn't over!

1032
00:58:13,425 --> 00:58:15,989
Thanks for your hospitality.

1033
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:18,981
- Ha ha ha... !
- Yeah.

1034
00:58:19,006 --> 00:58:22,209
Set sail for Piggy Island!

1035
00:58:27,294 --> 00:58:28,716
- Huh!
- Huh!

1036
00:58:40,888 --> 00:58:44,249
<font color="#ff8080">WORLD MAP
BIRD ISLAND</font>

1037
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,951
Huh!
Oh no!

1038
00:58:55,976 --> 00:58:57,701
We'll find them

1039
00:58:57,726 --> 00:58:59,924
Oh.
Oh.

1040
00:58:59,949 --> 00:59:03,887
Oh.
They're all gone.

1041
00:59:04,314 --> 00:59:05,920
<font color="#ff8040">DAYCARE</font>

1042
00:59:06,742 --> 00:59:09,311
Shh, shh.
It's okay.

1043
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:17,671
Mr. Red!

1044
00:59:23,244 --> 00:59:25,533
What do we do now?

1045
00:59:26,116 --> 00:59:27,721
Wait, hold on.
You're asking me?

1046
00:59:27,746 --> 00:59:30,663
You knew.
You try to tell us.

1047
00:59:30,688 --> 00:59:32,885
But we didn't listen.

1048
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:36,104
I didn't hear

1049
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:38,726
Red, we need a leader.

1050
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:40,442
- What do we do now?
- What do we do?

1051
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:42,702
Wait a minute.
I'm not a leader.

1052
00:59:42,727 --> 00:59:44,801
Okay. Pigs stole our kids.
That sucks.

1053
00:59:44,826 --> 00:59:48,110
Made all you guys looked like idiots.
You know what we got to do?

1054
00:59:48,135 --> 00:59:51,073
We start replacing those kids.

1055
00:59:51,098 --> 00:59:53,860
Ladies, get busy!

1056
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:55,984
We're going to be laying
some eggs tonight!

1057
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,813
No. No, stop.
No no no...

1058
00:59:57,838 --> 00:59:59,811
We're not going to
replace those kids.

1059
00:59:59,836 --> 01:00:02,856
- We're gonna get them back.
- How are we going to do that?

1060
01:00:02,881 --> 01:00:05,558
What do you mean how?
The pigs already showed us how.

1061
01:00:05,857 --> 01:00:07,699
That, is where they went!

1062
01:00:07,724 --> 01:00:10,134
And, so that,
is where we are going!

1063
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:12,305
But how do we get from here
to there?

1064
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:14,298
I'm not aquatic,
in the least.

1065
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:16,615
Well.
You know

1066
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,373
We're gonna build our own boat.

1067
01:00:18,398 --> 01:00:19,840
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

1068
01:00:19,865 --> 01:00:21,629
They stole your kids.

1069
01:00:21,654 --> 01:00:25,749
No. They stole our kids.
I mean, who does that?

1070
01:00:25,774 --> 01:00:28,318
Have you ever stolen
any one's children?

1071
01:00:28,343 --> 01:00:30,696
Huh?
Have you?

1072
01:00:30,926 --> 01:00:32,783
I mean, you look like you would.

1073
01:00:32,808 --> 01:00:35,451
And you know what?
I'm a little bit angry.

1074
01:00:35,476 --> 01:00:38,236
Correction.
I'm really angry.

1075
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:40,295
And I don't think
I'm the only one.

1076
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,880
Come on, we're birds!
We're descendants from dinosaurs!

1077
01:00:43,905 --> 01:00:46,678
We're not supposed to be nice!
Right?

1078
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:53,274
Uh.
Yeah, point-point made.

1079
01:00:53,299 --> 01:00:54,795
- Who else here is angry?
- I! -I!

1080
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,976
- I am.
- Yeah, you are!

1081
01:00:57,001 --> 01:00:59,736
We're getting our kids back,
and I don't need any

1082
01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:02,607
- ... calm, detach, happy birds.
- No.

1083
01:01:02,632 --> 01:01:04,605
Not going to help us.
Don't need it.

1084
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:08,244
I need some angry flocking birds.

1085
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:10,099
You hear me!
Now, who's angry!

1086
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,486
- Yeah!
- Angry!

1087
01:01:11,511 --> 01:01:13,131
Well, let's go!

1088
01:01:13,156 --> 01:01:15,692
Bring me everything that floats.

1089
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:17,586
Yeah. Yeah.
That's perfect, yeah.

1090
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,551
With every single feather
of my being,

1091
01:01:29,576 --> 01:01:34,187
I am not going to let any of these
eggs be taken from their parents.

1092
01:01:43,151 --> 01:01:44,893
Chuck, I need you to
tie those crates together.

1093
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:46,247
You got it.

1094
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:49,558
- Done, and done.
- Uh. A little help here?

1095
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,261
Let's go!
Move it, everybody!

1096
01:01:51,286 --> 01:01:53,163
- Push with your upper body.
- Put your back into it.

1097
01:01:53,188 --> 01:01:55,974
I have no upper body!

1098
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,372
Darn good for a bunch of birds.

1099
01:01:58,397 --> 01:02:01,550
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yay!

1100
01:02:10,885 --> 01:02:12,245
Go Leonard!

1101
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,540
When I say, "Eat the".
You say, "eggs."

1102
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,949
- Eat the.
- Eggs!

1103
01:02:18,974 --> 01:02:20,849
Wow, what a reception.

1104
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:23,417
Alright, snouts up!

1105
01:02:24,629 --> 01:02:28,728
My, it's a snout staircase.
Who thinks of that?

1106
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:34,870
Welcome home,
King Mudbeard!

1107
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:41,245
My father, and my father's father,
and my weird Aunt Chloe,

1108
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:43,502
have all searched for the eggs.

1109
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:45,630
But only I,

1110
01:02:45,655 --> 01:02:48,933
- King Mudbeard, have found them.
- Oh. My pom-poms.

1111
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:52,428
I present to you,
the EGGS!

1112
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:56,876
Say goodbye to Harvey.

1113
01:02:56,901 --> 01:02:58,700
- A feast!
- Huh!

1114
01:02:58,725 --> 01:03:01,996
I proclaim a feast!
2 nights heads.

1115
01:03:02,021 --> 01:03:03,341
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1116
01:03:03,366 --> 01:03:04,766
- I ♥ cholesterol!
- Let's EAT.

1117
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:07,790
Let's go make some omelets!

1118
01:03:16,365 --> 01:03:19,107
Oh. I feel a little nervous inside,
but that's normal, right?

1119
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:21,444
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

1120
01:03:22,692 --> 01:03:25,489
Uh. Anybody else got
butterflies in the stomach?

1121
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:26,531
Yeah.

1122
01:03:26,556 --> 01:03:29,032
Probably because you ate
too many caterpillars.

1123
01:03:31,161 --> 01:03:33,708
Drop your nuts
and move your butts!

1124
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:36,154
Come on, let's go!

1125
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,849
- Oh no.
- Whoa.

1126
01:03:45,261 --> 01:03:47,728
I wasn't expecting this.

1127
01:03:50,575 --> 01:03:52,303
Well.
Hold on a second.

1128
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,522
That guy is the king?

1129
01:03:54,742 --> 01:03:57,278
He's got to have the eggs
with him in the castle.

1130
01:03:57,303 --> 01:03:59,288
- What the heck is a castle?
- And that's where we're going.

1131
01:03:59,313 --> 01:04:02,826
Hey, guys. Do you remember
everything you learned in my class?

1132
01:04:02,851 --> 01:04:03,949
- Yep.
- Nope.

1133
01:04:03,974 --> 01:04:06,107
- What class?
- Well, forget all of it for now.

1134
01:04:06,132 --> 01:04:07,931
Now it's time to let loose.

1135
01:04:07,956 --> 01:04:09,840
Oh good.
Because I never learn anything anyway.

1136
01:04:09,865 --> 01:04:11,652
Oh, me neither.
I actually just came to socialize.

1137
01:04:11,677 --> 01:04:12,996
I came for the snacks.

1138
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:15,165
You don't happen to have
any of it now, do you?

1139
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:17,204
Deep breath. Deep breath.
DEEP BREATH.

1140
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:19,740
How are we going to
get over those walls?

1141
01:04:19,765 --> 01:04:21,064
Uh.

1142
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:25,287
I'll tell you how.
We're gonna fly.

1143
01:04:25,592 --> 01:04:27,535
Remember.
The goal is the castle.

1144
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,348
Get to the castle.
Who wants to go first?

1145
01:04:30,373 --> 01:04:31,706
- Over here!
- I do!

1146
01:04:31,731 --> 01:04:34,128
- Me. Me. Me.
- Hey. Alright, Matilda.

1147
01:04:34,153 --> 01:04:35,767
Always a brides-space.

1148
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,893
Step right up.
Keep your wings, legs and beak

1149
01:04:37,918 --> 01:04:39,456
- inside the slingshot at all times.
- Shoot it!

1150
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:41,641
Okey-doke.
Fire!

1151
01:04:45,034 --> 01:04:46,585
And one,
and a whoa...

1152
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:47,921
Take that, porkers!

1153
01:04:47,946 --> 01:04:49,947
Incoming!

1154
01:04:50,274 --> 01:04:52,769
Boom, baby, boom!

1155
01:04:52,794 --> 01:04:55,627
Well, how about that? My teacher
can shoot fireballs out of her butt.

1156
01:04:55,652 --> 01:04:57,128
You, what's your name?
Hal?

1157
01:04:57,153 --> 01:04:58,659
I've seen you do something
strange before, right?

1158
01:04:58,684 --> 01:04:59,666
Well, let's see.

1159
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:03,128
- I'm really good at...
- It doesn't matter. Launch him.

1160
01:05:03,848 --> 01:05:05,729
Oh, this guys looks good.

1161
01:05:05,754 --> 01:05:07,461
He's gonna make it.

1162
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,236
This is incredible.
We're witnessing history right now.

1163
01:05:11,261 --> 01:05:12,729
No, he's coming back.

1164
01:05:12,754 --> 01:05:13,921
- He's coming, duck.
- Whoa whoa whoa...

1165
01:05:13,946 --> 01:05:15,611
Get down.
DUCK!

1166
01:05:15,636 --> 01:05:17,299
Whoa whoa whoa...

1167
01:05:17,324 --> 01:05:19,204
Uh.
Did we win?

1168
01:05:19,229 --> 01:05:20,942
Uh, no.
Not quite yet, buddy.

1169
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:24,090
Uh, we're still tied.
Hey, can we get an ice pack for Hal?

1170
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:26,333
- Medic!
- Alright. Who's up next!

1171
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:28,022
Whoa whoa whoa...
What can you do?

1172
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:29,913
Ah-choo!

1173
01:05:29,938 --> 01:05:33,267
- Uh... Yuck.
- Uh, need a tissue?

1174
01:05:38,649 --> 01:05:42,345
Calvin Swine.

1175
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:44,842
Who's next?
We need flyers, not standbyers!

1176
01:05:44,867 --> 01:05:46,195
Let's go!

1177
01:05:46,353 --> 01:05:49,291
You go out there and you show them
how frightening mimes can be.

1178
01:05:49,316 --> 01:05:50,312
Yeah!

1179
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:52,119
Oh my gosh!

1180
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:54,725
We're having a feast.
We're eating the eggs.

1181
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,277
Going to have a big feast.
Going to eat all the eggs.

1182
01:05:58,302 --> 01:06:00,416
Huh?
What?

1183
01:06:01,385 --> 01:06:03,294
- What is that?
- Whoa!

1184
01:06:05,785 --> 01:06:06,915
Fire!

1185
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,878
That guy again.

1186
01:06:08,903 --> 01:06:11,512
HAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL
- Citizens of Pig Island.

1187
01:06:11,537 --> 01:06:14,556
If you spot any birds
destroying your neighbourhood,

1188
01:06:14,581 --> 01:06:17,424
- please capture them.
- What did he say?

1189
01:06:17,448 --> 01:06:22,192
There's been a change of plan.
We will eat the eggs for lunch.

1190
01:06:22,217 --> 01:06:25,074
Did he say eat the eggs?

1191
01:06:35,987 --> 01:06:38,491
Okay. I want you to curl up
into a little ball, alright?

1192
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:41,182
- Make yourself aerodynamic.
- Like this?

1193
01:06:41,207 --> 01:06:42,704
To the left!
To the left!

1194
01:06:42,729 --> 01:06:44,641
- Let me at em!
- Launch!

1195
01:06:47,539 --> 01:06:51,023
Don't mess with Bubbles!

1196
01:06:51,622 --> 01:06:55,312
- Get him!
- Heat pile. Hog pile.

1197
01:06:55,441 --> 01:06:58,283
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO MESS WITH ME!

1198
01:06:58,308 --> 01:07:01,463
Wow, that blows.
Uh, in a good way.

1199
01:07:01,488 --> 01:07:03,139
- To the left!
- Oh. Hold on, wait.

1200
01:07:03,164 --> 01:07:04,745
My left of your left?

1201
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:08,105
My left is your left.
We are facing the same direction.

1202
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,227
Right.
Good call.

1203
01:07:09,252 --> 01:07:12,292
Just look where the last bird went
and adjust from there.

1204
01:07:12,317 --> 01:07:14,694
- I got this you guys.
- Alright.

1205
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:35,806
She got far,
but not far enough.

1206
01:07:35,831 --> 01:07:37,258
- Get her out of our town!
- Oh oh.

1207
01:07:37,283 --> 01:07:39,757
We have to get closer.

1208
01:07:40,463 --> 01:07:44,507
Judge power!

1209
01:07:47,478 --> 01:07:49,405
Trial by fire!

1210
01:07:49,445 --> 01:07:52,905
No, literally he's on fire right now.
Can somebody please help him?

1211
01:08:03,581 --> 01:08:07,367
Mighty Eagle!

1212
01:08:14,266 --> 01:08:16,505
Terence.
I got an idea.

1213
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:18,854
Do you think you can pull
the slingshot back far enough

1214
01:08:18,879 --> 01:08:20,827
to hit that giant boulder?

1215
01:08:20,852 --> 01:08:24,286
Okay. Launch me right towards
the top of that thing.

1216
01:08:27,266 --> 01:08:28,833
Ready.

1217
01:08:30,038 --> 01:08:32,430
Red, I'm not going to lie to you.
I am...

1218
01:08:32,804 --> 01:08:34,704
... going to miss you
when you die.

1219
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:37,849
Rest in peace, my friend.
Rest in peace.

1220
01:08:37,874 --> 01:08:40,125
Hey, guys.
Let's not get cheesy, okay?

1221
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,426
Ready.
Fire!

1222
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:51,965
This is gonna hurt.

1223
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,915
What was that?
Huh?

1224
01:08:55,601 --> 01:08:57,368
- My roof!
- Oh oh.

1225
01:08:57,393 --> 01:09:00,701
- Did he make it?
- I hope he's okay.

1226
01:09:00,873 --> 01:09:04,635
- I'm in!
- Yeah. I knew he would make it.

1227
01:09:06,026 --> 01:09:08,351
Send everyone else!

1228
01:09:08,376 --> 01:09:12,038
Guards!
There's a red bird in these walls.

1229
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,736
Bring him to me.

1230
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:15,868
- Aye aye, sir.
- Roger that, boss.

1231
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:19,594
Not in these walls.

1232
01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:21,727
In the castle!
Come on, you guys.

1233
01:09:21,752 --> 01:09:24,604
Here, pretty bird.
Here, pretty bird.

1234
01:09:28,016 --> 01:09:30,617
Transport the eggs!

1235
01:09:35,742 --> 01:09:37,085
<font color="#ff8080">NO EGGS
IN HERE</font>

1236
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:40,414
Launch me exactly the same way
you did for Red...!

1237
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:44,756
I wasn't ready!
Uh, faster!

1238
01:09:59,997 --> 01:10:01,462
Chuck, is that you?

1239
01:10:01,487 --> 01:10:03,873
Is this the house of horrors?

1240
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:05,987
I got to be honest.
You look a little... fine.

1241
01:10:06,012 --> 01:10:09,242
- You look fine, come on.
- Bomb's on his way.

1242
01:10:14,654 --> 01:10:16,302
Ouchy.

1243
01:10:16,327 --> 01:10:19,881
Ah! Ha!
Call in the Piggy Air Force!

1244
01:10:19,906 --> 01:10:21,454
What is that?

1245
01:10:22,557 --> 01:10:24,539
My loyal subjects.

1246
01:10:24,571 --> 01:10:27,681
The treacherous birds
have repaid our friendship

1247
01:10:27,706 --> 01:10:30,531
with an unprovoked act of aggression!

1248
01:10:30,556 --> 01:10:32,686
The attack will fail!

1249
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:37,515
We have glass! We have wood!
We have TNT.

1250
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:41,835
We tried to kill them with kindness
and now we're just gonna have to...

1251
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:43,896
Well, you know.

1252
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:45,685
Run!

1253
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:49,358
Who's gonna go next?

1254
01:10:55,558 --> 01:10:57,153
Aim for that ram.

1255
01:10:57,178 --> 01:10:58,336
- Yes.
- Yeah!

1256
01:10:58,361 --> 01:11:03,371
- Terence.
- Terence.

1257
01:11:03,506 --> 01:11:04,928
Get them!

1258
01:11:08,084 --> 01:11:10,473
- No.
- What happened?

1259
01:11:13,879 --> 01:11:16,012
No eggs in here.
No. Nope. No. No.

1260
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:18,327
Hey! Whoa.
I'm on this.

1261
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,390
Redrum.

1262
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:24,978
Uh.
Never mind.

1263
01:11:26,912 --> 01:11:28,767
Backup engine.

1264
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:35,141
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Wait. Hold on a second.

1265
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:36,859
Wait, I know that rear end.
That's Bomb.

1266
01:11:36,884 --> 01:11:39,617
Yeah. Chuck, that's not his rear end.
That's his face, man.

1267
01:11:39,649 --> 01:11:41,258
- Sorry, Bomb.
- No problem.

1268
01:11:41,283 --> 01:11:43,150
It's a shaky week.

1269
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:44,544
Thanks for getting me out.

1270
01:11:44,569 --> 01:11:51,190
- We want egg!
- We want egg!

1271
01:11:52,763 --> 01:11:55,283
He was sick.
But, then he got cured.

1272
01:11:55,673 --> 01:11:59,136
No eggs in... huh!
Ooo, these are clever pigs.

1273
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:01,527
Okay, look. I'm gonna run up
and tackle the pig on the left.

1274
01:12:01,552 --> 01:12:04,430
Bomb, you can handle too.
Chuck, I don't know if you can help?

1275
01:12:04,455 --> 01:12:09,178
We got to figure out a way
to get into that room...

1276
01:12:16,429 --> 01:12:17,711
<font color="#ff8080">FART
FACE</font>

1277
01:12:27,248 --> 01:12:29,712
... room
Anyone have any bright ideas?

1278
01:12:33,167 --> 01:12:37,321
- Uh. Huh?
- You are gonna pay for that.

1279
01:12:38,295 --> 01:12:39,608
What just happened?

1280
01:12:39,633 --> 01:12:41,868
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were saying.

1281
01:12:41,893 --> 01:12:44,137
And here we are?

1282
01:12:44,162 --> 01:12:46,065
We found them!
Oh oh.

1283
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:48,120
Oh, come on

1284
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:52,616
- Red!
- Guys, come on!

1285
01:12:52,641 --> 01:12:54,180
Quick, follow him.

1286
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:57,565
Things are looking sunny side up!

1287
01:12:57,903 --> 01:13:00,001
Guys, I'm here.
Everything is going to be okay.

1288
01:13:00,026 --> 01:13:01,491
- We are gonna get you out of here.
- Hurry up, Bomb!

1289
01:13:01,516 --> 01:13:02,815
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

1290
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,793
Don't lose me!

1291
01:13:04,818 --> 01:13:06,555
Goodness, they made a harem!

1292
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,288
Oh boy.

1293
01:13:08,313 --> 01:13:10,272
- We want egg!
- We want egg!

1294
01:13:10,297 --> 01:13:14,499
What is he doing up there?
This is a civilize buffet.

1295
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:24,099
Don't hatch now.
Do not hatch now.

1296
01:13:24,124 --> 01:13:26,289
Get that red skank off my eggs.

1297
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:28,301
- Hey!
- Oh man

1298
01:13:28,326 --> 01:13:31,256
- Bomb, are you okay?
- Oh, I've been better.

1299
01:13:32,411 --> 01:13:34,552
I'm going to get
a running start!

1300
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:38,677
- It's show time!
- Oh.

1301
01:13:38,702 --> 01:13:40,749
Fine.
Boil him too!

1302
01:13:40,774 --> 01:13:42,629
Let's pig out.

1303
01:13:42,654 --> 01:13:45,127
Looks like it's just
you and me, pork belly!

1304
01:13:45,152 --> 01:13:46,445
I'll be taking that!

1305
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,618
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa.

1306
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:54,884
- Hey? Oh.
- No!

1307
01:13:57,447 --> 01:14:00,144
- We're coming.
- Deep breath.

1308
01:14:04,883 --> 01:14:07,803
Ow! I'm in!
Classy joint.

1309
01:14:07,828 --> 01:14:09,585
- HELLO!
- Huh!

1310
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:12,850
- Where is everyone?
- Mighty Eagle. Where's he going?

1311
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:15,198
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

1312
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,831
Oh, my battle cry?

1313
01:14:22,268 --> 01:14:24,052
Coming in.
Coming in.

1314
01:14:24,077 --> 01:14:28,115
Mighty Eagle!

1315
01:14:32,137 --> 01:14:33,406
Oh oh.

1316
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:35,272
Whoa!

1317
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:44,940
Mighty-Mighty Eagle.
Might Eagle, wake up, come on.

1318
01:14:44,965 --> 01:14:46,211
Oh, that's bad breath.

1319
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:49,588
I can sleep late, Mom.
It's not a school day.

1320
01:14:49,612 --> 01:14:53,497
Throw him in the pot too.
I'll have the big turkey.

1321
01:14:56,222 --> 01:14:57,860
- Red!
- What!

1322
01:14:57,885 --> 01:14:59,878
- Huh!
- Whoa! What did I miss.

1323
01:14:59,903 --> 01:15:02,483
- You got to fly those eggs to safety.
- I got this.

1324
01:15:02,508 --> 01:15:04,341
Here we go!

1325
01:15:07,622 --> 01:15:11,515
- Whoa. Whoooaaa.
- Yes! Yes. Yes!

1326
01:15:14,931 --> 01:15:16,151
My eggs!

1327
01:15:16,176 --> 01:15:18,412
- Don't forget Chuck and Bomb.
- Who?

1328
01:15:18,437 --> 01:15:20,797
- Those guys.
- Right. Right.

1329
01:15:22,046 --> 01:15:23,702
Got you.

1330
01:15:29,238 --> 01:15:31,566
You're not getting away that easy.

1331
01:15:35,015 --> 01:15:36,519
No!

1332
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:43,048
- Save yourselves.
- Hold on, Red!

1333
01:15:43,073 --> 01:15:45,947
- I'm gonna save that egg.
- Red, don't be a hero.

1334
01:15:45,972 --> 01:15:48,419
- Red, no.
- No!

1335
01:15:52,017 --> 01:15:53,039
Huh?

1336
01:15:53,064 --> 01:15:56,218
- Get out of town, everybody.
- Whoa.

1337
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,506
There's just so many of them,
we're outnumbered.

1338
01:15:59,531 --> 01:16:01,376
What?
How many?

1339
01:16:01,401 --> 01:16:03,033
Oh, not that many.
Just the right amount really.

1340
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,888
No need to look back.
Just keep flying.

1341
01:16:04,913 --> 01:16:06,571
FASTER!

1342
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:09,503
- I'll take that!
- No, you won't!

1343
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,368
Give me that!

1344
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:16,265
You just don't know
when to stop, do you?

1345
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:18,598
Here's a 2 word answer,
"Uh-uh!"

1346
01:16:18,623 --> 01:16:21,830
Looks like your little
slingshot game ends here.

1347
01:16:21,855 --> 01:16:23,968
- Give me that!
- Not going to happen!

1348
01:16:23,993 --> 01:16:25,289
Huh!

1349
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:28,148
Oh no.

1350
01:16:29,203 --> 01:16:30,967
Get out of my way.

1351
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,758
- Every pig for himself.
- I quit!

1352
01:16:35,783 --> 01:16:39,901
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1353
01:16:39,926 --> 01:16:42,933
I know what I got to do.
I got to blow up that ram.

1354
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:45,705
And that would be a good plan
if you were good at blowing up.

1355
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:47,385
I need to stop those planes!

1356
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:49,376
Remember me, Chuck.
Remember me.

1357
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:52,073
Bomb's away!

1358
01:16:56,956 --> 01:16:59,817
- Oh, hi there.
- Here, chicky chicky chicky.

1359
01:16:59,842 --> 01:17:02,032
This little piggy popped!

1360
01:17:02,057 --> 01:17:04,239
This little piggy exploded.

1361
01:17:04,264 --> 01:17:06,641
And this little piggy went
wee, wee, wee,

1362
01:17:06,666 --> 01:17:08,951
"I want my mother!"

1363
01:17:11,839 --> 01:17:13,939
Come on, Bomb,
you can you do this!

1364
01:17:13,964 --> 01:17:16,363
Blow up.
Blow up.

1365
01:17:18,236 --> 01:17:20,594
- Oh oh.
- Ah ha ha ha!

1366
01:17:20,619 --> 01:17:22,775
Oh no.

1367
01:17:23,284 --> 01:17:26,871
Think explosive thoughts.
Surprise parties!

1368
01:17:27,737 --> 01:17:29,778
Yoga poses!

1369
01:17:30,705 --> 01:17:33,438
PIG CITY AIRPLANES!

1370
01:17:37,943 --> 01:17:41,078
I blew up, on purpose.

1371
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:43,421
You're wrecking my house.
What's wrong with you?

1372
01:17:43,446 --> 01:17:45,893
- You wrecked my house!
- Your house was ugly!

1373
01:17:45,918 --> 01:17:47,894
Well, now we're even.

1374
01:17:54,578 --> 01:17:56,106
Strike!

1375
01:17:58,285 --> 01:18:00,081
Run!
Run!

1376
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:04,861
Guys, look out!

1377
01:18:06,368 --> 01:18:08,409
Everyone, stand back!

1378
01:18:13,919 --> 01:18:15,419
Terence?

1379
01:18:15,707 --> 01:18:18,732
Put on your seat belts, everyone.
Trust me.

1380
01:18:23,671 --> 01:18:26,908
Well.
This is dynamite.

1381
01:18:33,848 --> 01:18:35,186
Aw.
There you are.

1382
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,119
Not by the hair on
my chinny-chin-chin!

1383
01:18:41,295 --> 01:18:44,096
Delicious bird eggy wiggy.
Ooo.

1384
01:18:44,121 --> 01:18:45,614
You can't eat eggs!

1385
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:48,090
What are you going to do?
I'm a foodie.

1386
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:53,548
It's over.
You're finished, eyebrows.

1387
01:18:53,573 --> 01:18:55,988
Ah ha ha ha...!

1388
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:01,997
Anger, is not always the answer!

1389
01:19:03,684 --> 01:19:07,144
Well, you know what,
I guess you win.

1390
01:19:07,169 --> 01:19:08,634
What?

1391
01:19:09,057 --> 01:19:12,597
That was an awesome plan.
Mind blower.

1392
01:19:13,184 --> 01:19:15,546
Really?
Well, thank you.

1393
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:18,880
You know, a lot of hard work
goes in my sinister plans.

1394
01:19:18,905 --> 01:19:20,398
It does.

1395
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:23,956
No, I mean your plan was great.

1396
01:19:23,981 --> 01:19:26,527
But you didn't plan for THIS!

1397
01:19:43,357 --> 01:19:46,269
You have annoyed me
for the last time.

1398
01:19:46,294 --> 01:19:47,611
Yep.

1399
01:19:47,806 --> 01:19:49,073
Huh?

1400
01:19:51,711 --> 01:19:53,529
FASTER!

1401
01:19:53,554 --> 01:19:55,551
Whoa!

1402
01:20:05,211 --> 01:20:07,441
Cramp.
Cramp.

1403
01:20:08,052 --> 01:20:09,852
- It's them!
- Look at that.

1404
01:20:09,877 --> 01:20:11,518
Are you seeing
what I am seeing?

1405
01:20:11,543 --> 01:20:13,336
- It's Mighty Eagle.
- It's him!

1406
01:20:13,361 --> 01:20:15,603
Well. This guy looks
nothing like his statue.

1407
01:20:15,628 --> 01:20:18,082
- Honey.
- Our eggs!

1408
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,724
- Are you okay?
- Chuck, my man.

1409
01:20:33,749 --> 01:20:36,162
- Did you see what I did back there?
- Yeah.

1410
01:20:37,991 --> 01:20:40,622
Oh.
This egg is a splitting image of you.

1411
01:20:40,647 --> 01:20:43,713
There, safe and sound.

1412
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,110
- Oh!
- Huh!

1413
01:20:52,135 --> 01:20:54,442
- Where is he?
- Red.

1414
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:56,949
Where is he?

1415
01:21:05,971 --> 01:21:07,060
Huh!

1416
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:09,673
I think he might be dead.

1417
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,552
Daddy!

1418
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:29,345
- He's alive!
- He's alive!

1419
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:31,172
Woo-hoo!

1420
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,233
- Oh!
- What?

1421
01:21:47,346 --> 01:21:48,771
- Yeah!
- Oh ho ho!

1422
01:21:48,796 --> 01:21:50,320
I'm glad you're alive.

1423
01:21:50,345 --> 01:21:53,206
I thought you died
or defected to the pig's side.

1424
01:21:53,231 --> 01:21:56,090
- Hey, buddy, way to not be dead.
- Oh.

1425
01:21:56,115 --> 01:21:58,970
- It's good to see you guys.
- Come on.

1426
01:22:00,156 --> 01:22:03,380
- Yay!
- Yay!

1427
01:22:03,496 --> 01:22:06,022
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Glad you're back!

1428
01:22:06,242 --> 01:22:09,710
- You did it, great job!
- You're the bird!

1429
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,762
Sir.
Ma'am.

1430
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:20,239
I think these belong to you.

1431
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,954
Oh.
Oh.

1432
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:29,713
Thank you.

1433
01:22:30,494 --> 01:22:33,640
Oh, Crimson, Woody, Ash.

1434
01:22:33,665 --> 01:22:35,108
- Who?
- Is he talking to us?

1435
01:22:35,133 --> 01:22:37,509
You learn your lessons well.

1436
01:22:37,534 --> 01:22:39,767
Come on, bring it in.

1437
01:22:39,946 --> 01:22:41,476
No.
I'm not the really affectionate type.

1438
01:22:41,501 --> 01:22:43,702
Uh.
Okay

1439
01:22:43,727 --> 01:22:46,332
Does it feel like this is
crossing the line, anyone else?

1440
01:22:46,357 --> 01:22:48,568
- Yep.
- No.

1441
01:22:48,806 --> 01:22:51,633
- You're my prize pupils.
- Your prize what?

1442
01:22:51,658 --> 01:22:53,455
Ho ho, don't you see?

1443
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,846
I had to make you
lose faith in me.

1444
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:58,355
So you can learn to have
faith in yourself.

1445
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,159
- That's not really how it felt.
- Tell them, Rosie.

1446
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:03,122
Yeah. I don't think
that's what happened, man.

1447
01:23:03,147 --> 01:23:06,436
Oh look, he's blushing.

1448
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:09,737
I'm not blushing,
I'm just red.

1449
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:15,962
Okay, who wants an autograph?

1450
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:25,622
Go get him.

1451
01:23:25,647 --> 01:23:26,913
Hoist it up.

1452
01:23:27,342 --> 01:23:28,757
Nice.

01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:43,498
Well done indeed.

1458
01:23:46,566 --> 01:23:49,411
Wow.
Is that you right there, Red?

1459
01:23:49,436 --> 01:23:50,701
Aw, really?
Where?

1460
01:23:50,726 --> 01:23:53,686
No, they didn't have to...
Oh. Yeah.

1461
01:23:53,711 --> 01:23:56,885
That's funny. I don't remember
crying on my knees like that.

1462
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,160
But, you know,
it's nice.

1463
01:23:59,185 --> 01:24:02,482
Look at that.
They gave Mighty Eagle all the credit.

1464
01:24:02,507 --> 01:24:05,503
They made him look so much
more handsome than you.

1465
01:24:05,528 --> 01:24:07,792
You know,
back when I was angry.

1466
01:24:07,817 --> 01:24:09,858
That would have
really ticked me off.

1467
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:11,517
Ah, forget about that.

1468
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:13,506
You know what we should do?
Let's go to the village.

1469
01:24:13,531 --> 01:24:15,254
- Let's do it.
- No. Actually I love to go...

1470
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:17,050
... hang out with you guys.
But you know I got this thing.

1471
01:24:17,075 --> 01:24:18,771
And I have another thing
after that thing

1472
01:24:18,796 --> 01:24:21,737
- and there's all these things in a row.
- Would you look at that.

1473
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:25,488
What the?

1474
01:24:38,883 --> 01:24:41,005
HOME TWEET HOME

1475
01:24:46,508 --> 01:24:50,807
Mr. Red.
Welcome back, to the village.

1476
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,931
Ta-da!

1477
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:24,159
Mighty Mighty Red
You rescued me.

1478

Defender of our homes and liberty.

1479
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:34,691
Bravery. Humility. Angery

1480
01:25:35,524 --> 01:25:42,335
Mighty Mighty Red
You Rescued Me

1481
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,008
Me...

1482
01:25:45,033 --> 01:25:51,813

Lalalaa
Lalalalaaaaaaaaa.

1484
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,905
Oh my gosh.

1485
01:26:14,322 --> 01:26:16,928
How did you guys find
the time to pull this off?

1486
01:26:16,953 --> 01:26:19,174
This is why we went to
go get pedicure, isn't it?

1487
01:26:19,205 --> 01:26:21,706
Nope. We got pedicures
because we are worth it.

1488
01:26:21,731 --> 01:26:23,734
- I got gels.
- You guys are something else.

1489
01:26:23,759 --> 01:26:25,942
To be honest with you,
I'm going to miss the beach view.

1490
01:26:25,967 --> 01:26:27,441
But, so what.
It's still there.

1491
01:26:27,466 --> 01:26:30,374
It's just not... right there when
I wake up and look out my window.

1492
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:32,910
Well, you can still look out your
window and see me and Bomb.

1493
01:26:32,935 --> 01:26:34,115
Right.

1494
01:26:34,154 --> 01:26:36,158
So you know,
pluses and minuses.

1495
01:26:36,183 --> 01:26:38,224
Okay, see you later.

1496
01:26:38,721 --> 01:26:40,018
Oh.

1497
01:26:41,274 --> 01:26:45,136
- Well, this just got awkward.
- That's really insensitive.

1498
01:26:45,379 --> 01:26:46,954
Want to go get a bite?

1499
01:26:46,979 --> 01:26:49,834
Forget it, let's just go home.

1500
01:26:52,859 --> 01:26:55,505
Guys, I'm just messing with you.

1501
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:57,165
Get in here!

1502
01:26:57,829 --> 01:27:00,135
- Ha ha ha ha! I knew it!
- Let's be roomies.

1503
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:02,931
Room mates. Boy, I can't wait
to make a chores list.

1504
01:27:02,956 --> 01:27:04,902
- Wait, hold on a second.
- I'll move my nest into the master bedroom.

1505
01:27:04,927 --> 01:27:06,616
- Bomb, you can stay in the guest half.
- No no no...

1506
01:27:06,641 --> 01:27:09,180
- Ah! Can we get a bunk nest?
- Oh, this is going to be perfect.

1507
01:27:09,205 --> 01:27:11,898
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Guys... No!

Leonard can't dance.
He's hatching a new plan.

1517
01:28:45,357 --> 01:28:47,628
Okay, maybe I'll dance
for just a sec.

1518
01:28:52,466 --> 01:28:53,413
- Woo!
- Yee-haw!

1519
01:28:53,438 --> 01:28:55,089
