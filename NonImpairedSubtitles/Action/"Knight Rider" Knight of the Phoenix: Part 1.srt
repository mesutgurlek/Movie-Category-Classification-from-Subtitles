Soon. I have the crews working

Don't you worry about

- Mr. Knight, my last partner is dead.

Now what's all this about my car?

Any resemblance between that car

What are you talking about?
Devon, that's my car.
I left it out in the desert.

No, it may look like your car,

219
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:54,023

this vehicle is probably
the most expensive car in the world.

Come on. This is my car.

Boy, those guys did a nice job.

<i>Like a mirror.</i>

It is a one-of-a-kind car, Mr. Long.

Don't tell me this thing flies.

I would have preferred you
to have let me open the door first.

However, as you see,
no harm has come to the car.

You also told me this machine
couldn't have a collision.

Not if the system is operable.

258

It's a regular boomtown.

568
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,240
There's more money flowing
through here now than there was
during the California gold rush.

569
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,745
All because of tiny microchips.

Yeah. Every calculator,

00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,480
every electronic kids' game...
they were all born right here.

572

How do you fit into Silicon Valley?

573
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,324
My husband came here
to take a job as head of security
for Comtron.

00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,123
- Didn't work out?
- Oh, yes.

575
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,130
It worked out just fine...

576
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:45,328
till the president decided to hire
a brand-new executive assistant.

580
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,847
Then she came along,
and she started making
wholesale changes.

581

You mean your husband was fired?

582

Not exactly.

583
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:11,293
He couldn't accept what was going on,
and he started... poking into things.

584
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,454
And one night he didn't come home.

585
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,261
Disappeared?

586
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,358
They found him dead in a gully.

587
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,029
<i>Said he'd been drinking.</i>

588
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:24,905
He didn't drink.
Not even beer.

589

All animals who work for Comtron.

592

You wouldn't have taken that job
to find some answers, would you?

593
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,991
I took that job

<i>Remember, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is a figure-eight track,</i>

747
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,658

Gosh! I've never seen anything like it.
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be with your mother.

753
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,019

<i>Ooh, that was powerful.</i>

755

Aw, why'd you chicken out?
Because you're standing there
ready to be flipped out of the car.

756
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,893
Now get in that seat right now
and strap yourself down!
Hurry up!

757
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,023
<i>Now, once again, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

759

Let's see if he backs down again.

760

<i>- They've blocked him.</i>
- Okay, KITT.

762
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,617
I need to knock out about four feet.
I'm gonna put you on auto pursuit.

Yeah! You not only wiped him out,
you wiped out the truck too!

768
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:35,406
These guys aren't supposed to
hit my trucks.
Where'd you get these new drivers, Tanya?

769
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:38,311
Thanks. I needed that.

770
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:41,646
You're welcome.
It's so good to be
communicating again.

771
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,414
Golly! This car even talks.

772
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:47,217
Oh, that was, uh...
that was just the radio, Buddy.

773

No, it wasn't.
I may just be a little kid,
but I'm not stupid.

774
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:55,894
The car talked to you.
It might be better if we don't
mention this to a whole lot of people.

775
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,196
Like any, if you know what I mean.

776
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,236

- Loud and clear.

He doesn't exist.

We've checked his credit card
numbers from the club,
car license... everything.

Up until three months ago,

Well, phony credentials

- Since I saw that car perform.

840

00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,867
<i>but quite another</i>
<i>to steal an entire prototype.</i>

<i>I don't like it.</i>
<i>It smells like a setup.</i>

843
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,709
Did you run his fingerprints?

844
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,476
I don't have any.
Anyway, that's a fallacy.

845
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,519
Fingerprints are only on file
if somebody's got a criminal record.

846
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:40,044
Or has worked for the government
in some law enforcement capacity.

There's two ways to fight a war, Devon.
With an army or all by yourself.

870
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,679
But you can have an army.

871
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,719
That's always been my point.

872
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,847
But not the biggest army.
That's my point.
