1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,810
The situation is changing.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,610
It has nothing to do with personal thoughts.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,150
Time constantly flows.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,280
It doesn't care about people struggling.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,580
In that case, Lelouch is happy, right?

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,230
Since, at the very least, he could decide how the world operates through his own power.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,530
The ability to give an order to anyone. 
A power that enforces absolute obedience.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,440
He can still rely on the Geass.

9
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,800
It's true.

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,440
Due to the intervention of the Chinese Federation and the terrorist acts carried out by the Order of the Black Knights,

11
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
there are various instances of uproar taking place around the world.

12
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,710
However, this problem is not tied to that.

13
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,450
It's a fact that your attendance is not sufficient!

14
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,160
No matter how good your grades are...

15
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,070
No matter whether you're Princess Euphemia's knight or not!

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,480
You have no choice but to repeat the grade if your attendance is not sufficient!

17
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,390
Looks like it's going to take some time.

18
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,040
Think we'll finish by tonight?

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,690
In the end Zero was our savior, right?

20
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,350
Even an Eleven can become successful. Look at that Kururgi Suzaku!

21
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,780
Kyushu would have been taken away by the Chinese Federation if Zero hadn't been around, right?

22
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,010
But that wasn't reported on the news...

23
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,120
Britannia wouldn't report that, would they?

24
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,600
Anything is fine as long as there's peace.

25
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,880
What Kururugi is working towards is peace brought about by slavery!

26
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,380
The opinions in the ghetto are divided?

27
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,300
They are either in favor of the support faction or the rebel faction.

28
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,800
But everyone was surprised, right?

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,190
Discovering that Zero wanted to build a country...

30
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,150
Yup, yup. That's too reckless.

31
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,880
He should have been more realistic.

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,690
I agree with Zero.

33
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,610
Eh?

34
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,950
It's true, right?

35
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,960
Your life will change greatly by following that guy.

36
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,780
My dream of becoming a bureaucrat might come true too.

37
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,550
Bureaucrat? Are you serious?

38
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,250
I have dreams too.

39
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,040
I'd most likely be abusing Refrain now if I hadn't joined the Order of the Black Knights.

40
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,220
Refrain? You...

41
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,620
<i>If Refrain is used... the past... even Zero's real identity...</i>

42
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,830
Even if I know that... what should I do...?

43
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,520
Ohgi-san.

44
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,480
About what we were saying earlier...

45
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,470
We can't contact Zero, even if we want to wait for his instructions...

46
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,250
Then, as we planned earlier, I...

47
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,130
It's a trap. Give up on it.

48
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,200
But information routes are essential.

49
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,320
It's said that there are people there who want to join the Order too...

50
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,290
Also, the escape routes that Diethard planned can only be used tomorrow...

51
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,790
Everyone, sorry to keep you waiting!

52
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:02,050
The most open school festival in the Tokyo Settlement will now commence in Ashford Academy!

53
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,840
The signal to begin will be the voice of this person.

54
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,860
Erm... is it okay?

55
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,790
It's okay.

56
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,870
Then...

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,540
Nya~

58
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,940
Today sure is noisy...

59
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,970
Welcome!

60
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,940
Welcome!!!

61
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,110
It's Britannian cuisine!

62
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,850
A farcical and controversial story:

63
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,460
"Tokyo and Zero". Currently being shown!

64
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,260
We have Prince Clovis's photo here!

65
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,900
As I thought, Sawasaki and his goons were useful.

66
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,250
With this, quite a fair bit of the conditions have been cleared.

67
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,110
Yes.

68
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,380
All the data concerning the emergency measures that each city is taking have already been collected.

69
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,410
People from the media?

70
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,730
We have also obtained a diagram showing where the solar power panels and energy collection centers are located in each settlement.

71
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,060
What about the supporter that we discussed earlier?

72
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,460
I alone am more than sufficient.

73
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,950
I've worked out about 72% of the details.

74
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,200
What about Tohdoh?

75
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,140
We have obtained a detailed layout of the territory we're aiming to capture from the television, and he's inspecting it right now.

76
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,450
However, he wants to check that along with the plan to make use of a large dummy with you.

77
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,660
I understand.

78
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,780
We'll confirm it tomorrow.

79
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,370
Also, there's something I'm late in reporting.

80
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,560
About that incident with Team Zero, Vice-Commander Ohgi is...

81
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,610
A pinch! We are caught in a big pinch!

82
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,420
I'll contact you later.

83
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,250
Hmm? A pinch?

84
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,370
Why are you idling around?

85
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,310
Lelouch, you're the head of the executive committee, aren't you?

86
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,590
It's proceeding fine without me.

87
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,790
Besides, President, you're in charge of that, aren't you?

88
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,570
It was only two meters last year.

89
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,870
Suddenly we need to make a pizza with a diameter of twelve meters.

90
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,300
Hmm, isn't that amazing?

91
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,660
Once we've succeeded, it'll be the first of its type in the world!

92
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,230
Just the oven and ingredients alone created a huge ruckus.

93
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,380
You invited a television crew over too.

94
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,170
You know that we can't show our faces, right?

95
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,270
We have to document the record broken by the pizza.

96
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,400
It's fine as long as you hide in the booth.

97
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,280
Okay? President's order.

98
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,270
Okay, stop.

99
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,350
Rivalz, I'm done on my end!

100
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,940
Ah, you seem to be in a good mood.

101
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,870
Did something nice happen?

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,250
Yeah, sort of.

103
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm sorry that you're going out alone with an Eleven from the ghetto...

104
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,570
It's all right.

105
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,420
If you find Britannians scary...

106
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,750
You don't have to worry so much.

107
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,550
Anyway, is this really going to help you with your work?

108
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,590
Yeah...

109
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,370
I need to gather information for the development plan.

110
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,930
I see. That's great.

111
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,700
<i>What the heck am I doing?</i>

112
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,830
<i>At this rate I should just send her to the police station instead of the hospital when possible...</i>

113
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,590
<i>No, I can't.</i>

114
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,780
<i>The others will be dragged down if information about me leaks out.</i>

115
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,340
<i>But for me to silence her...</i>

116
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,410
<i>To me that's...</i>

117
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,580
How about this place?

118
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,190
What's wrong?

119
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,350
Ah, it's nothing.

120
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,840
I used to be a school teacher in the past, so I felt nostalgic.

121
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,790
Why did you quit?

122
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,120
There was a close friend who I knew since I was a child, but he died.

123
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,970
I shall realize his dream for him.

124
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,600
That dream is quite a burden on me though.

125
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,140
Let's go in.

126
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,550
I-In? But... I'm an Eleven...

127
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,100
That's not a problem!

128
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,620
We are fairly open about this.

129
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,820
I shall lead the two of you!

130
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,840
W-Wait a minute, they are our customers!

131
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,530
This is great.

132
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,420
I thought that you wouldn't come to school anymore.

133
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,660
Then you did it on purpose?

134
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,960
Why didn't you tell anyone about my true identity?

135
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,380
You are Kallen Stadtfeld now, aren't you?

136
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,710
Not Kouzuki Kallen.

137
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,260
Do you intend to capture me after showing me compassion?

138
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,700
I won't show you mercy if we meet on the battlefield.

139
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,620
But I want to continue to try to convince you.

140
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,980
I know this is against the rules,

141
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,100
but in school, rather than fighting, I choose to try to convince you.

142
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,390
You seem to have changed.

143
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,840
Suzaku, the truck has arrived.

144
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,280
The cheese is...

145
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,700
You came to school?

146
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,700
Y-Yes... My physical condition wasn't that bad.

147
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,570
Kallen, about what we spoke of earlier, it has nothing to do with school.

148
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,790
I understand.

149
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,220
Kallen, if possible, can you go to the classrom to help out?

150
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,890
They seem to be short on people there.

151
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,880
Ah, if it's just that...

152
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,820
Hah! Are you frightened?!

153
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,060
Bleh, don't be scared just by this.

154
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,120
Anyway, Lelouch that asshole...

155
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,430
If it's a horror house, just explain that it's a horror house.

156
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,900
Hmph, the only one who can order me around is Zero.

157
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,790
Ah... another couple?

158
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,870
If they can do something like this, they might as well mechanize everything...

159
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,250
Even though it is light, it's pretty hot wearing it.

160
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,320
It's nearly the same as the early Glasgow models.

161
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,410
So hurry up...

162
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,600
Hurry...

163
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,270
Hurry up, damn it!

164
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,130
Oh? Ohgi-san?

165
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,030
You were safe?

166
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,090
Thanks to you...

167
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,070
The school festival sure is fun!

168
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,840
She's aiming only for him... You think he resembles Lloyd-san?

169
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,060
It's indeed harsh to leave everything to her...

170
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,540
Yes. The pizza will start in the afternoon.

171
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,890
This isn't the time to be doing this.

172
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,020
Yes?

173
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,320
Drama club?

174
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,400
I've already spoken to the movie society.

175
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,070
If this goes on, the preparation for the coup d'état will...

176
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,700
I'm sorry!

177
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,740
It slipped out of my hand.

178
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,620
Even soldiers? It sure is peaceful here...

179
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,100
Oh? You're Suzaku-kun's...?

180
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,750
Hey, you there!

181
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,330
Where can I eat the pizza that they claim is the largest in the world?

182
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,670
Oh, you were here?

183
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,510
To think you came back after spending just one night at Area 18.

184
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,480
The Cornelia army sure is excellent.

185
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,950
It was nothing.

186
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,980
Brother, it's all because you loaned us your own personal army.

187
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,150
It's natural for me to do that.

188
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,550
Joining up with the Graston Knights that were on standby in the main country.

189
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,850
This allows our army to regain the prestige it should always have.

190
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,320
The Zattel Buffer of the Glouester is ready too.

191
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,060
I understand.

192
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,730
I will make use of that card in my negotiations with the Chinese Federation.

193
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,030
I'll leave it to you.

194
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,910
It's such an honor.

195
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,830
Eh?

196
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,830
To be depended on by Princess Cornelia who is unrivaled in the battlefield.

197
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,340
Please don't make fun of me.

198
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,890
I'm telling the truth.

199
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,390
In the battlefield you're much more beautiful and dazzling than any flower or butterfly at a ball.

200
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,710
Yes, you're like the Flash of Lightning.

201
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,470
Please don't say that about me.

202
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,790
I wonder where Euphie's gone?

203
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,770
Brother is about to set off.

204
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,500
Euphie already spoke to me last night.

205
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,630
Last night?

206
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,440
Yes.

207
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,720
Ah, also, about that thing that Bartley is in-charge of...

208
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,660
Ah, I don't mind. But is that thing actually useful?

209
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,970
As I was saying, the world's largest pizza.

210
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,870
I said that I would bring some back. Stay in the room.

211
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,680
But you're a liar.

212
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,130
I won't pull tricks for such things.

213
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,000
Soilders and people from the media are around.

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,010
What would I do if you got caught?

215
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,810
It tastes better when it's freshly baked from the oven.

216
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,270
Bring the disguise kit over.

217
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,680
Right now, I'm now busy planning the school festival and the coup d'état...

218
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,090
Why did you come into the school?

219
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,640
I-I...

220
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,100
Who are you?

221
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,270
You don't seem to be an Eleven.

222
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:12,900
What is your name?

223
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,220
She's...

224
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,340
My...

225
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,950
Kallen?

226
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,490
This place is off-limits to unauthorized personnel.

227
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,580
Hurry up and get out...

228
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
Ohgi?

229
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,700
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,370
There's something that I have to tell Suzaku.

231
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,290
Ah, it's all right.

232
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,460
Euphie, I think that this idea is wonderful.

233
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,170
R-Really? Then!

234
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,900
It's good for you to follow the path you believe in.

235
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,200
I'll try to talk to Cornelia on your behalf.

236
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,170
<i>Suzaku, Brother has agreed with my thinking.</i>

237
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,350
<i>With this...</i>

238
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,310
Eh?!

239
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,700
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

240
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,430
No, I should be the one apologizing...

241
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,230
Huh? Nunnally?

242
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,150
Eh? That voice, don't tell me...?

243
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,330
<i>Damn, he saw Ohgi...!</i>

244
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,120
<i>This is bad. If they see C.C. here...</i>

245
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,410
The gas cylinders used for the burner...

246
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,450
I remember the spares were placed here...

247
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,110
Oh?

248
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,670
Kallen?

249
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,050
E-Erm... Hello.

250
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,500
Are the spare cylinders there?

251
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,840
Rivalz is looking for them.

252
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,080
Ah... They might be on the other side.

253
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,900
Is that so?

254
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,200
This is so troublesome.

255
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,890
Can't you just use the Geass?

256
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,460
It's too dangerous to use it on Ohgi and that unknown person.

257
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,400
Also, the rest are people that I've used it on.

258
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,630
You get what you deserve. Who asked you to use it so freely?

259
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,350
You... Don't you understand what the current situation is?!

260
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,650
Lelouch?

261
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,020
You were here?

262
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,820
If that's so, there's something I want to discuss with you.

263
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,600
For now, you escape alone first.

264
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,670
Shirley.

265
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,620
I'll talk to you later.

266
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,670
I'm kind of busy right now...

267
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,670
I'll create a diversion.

268
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,580
Make use of that chance.

269
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,320
What are you saying?

270
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,250
I don't get to meet you except for times like this.

271
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,190
Argh!

272
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,250
Oh no, the board is falling! Run!

273
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,290
Argh!

274
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,220
Hey, don't just stand there!

275
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,010
Shirley!

276
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,820
Erm... Erm... Thanks...

277
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,510
It's great that you're safe.

278
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,240
But what is this smoke?

279
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
It's probably a warning that gas is leaking.

280
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,080
Looks like the valve has come loose.

281
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,500
More importantly, can someone help me?

282
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,100
What's wrong?

283
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,290
I feel... a familiar sensation on my leg...

284
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,500
Sorry for getting you involved in such a weird incident.

285
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,340
It's okay. I sort of enjoyed myself.

286
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,410
It's been a while since I've felt this excited.

287
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,930
You're not going to leave Area 11?

288
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,760
If you do that, the person who shot you won't be able to chase after you.

289
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,560
Ohgi-san... Was the previous me much happier than how I am now?

290
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,680
That is why...

291
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,850
Eh?

292
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,270
Can you... continue with what you wanted to say?

293
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,860
"She's my...?"

294
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,860
What am I?

295
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,570
Y-You're...

296
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,280
I... don't mind becoming an Eleven.

297
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Can you keep things about Brother and me secret?

298
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,090
But if this goes on...

299
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,300
I'm fine as long as I get to live with Brother.

300
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,270
Do you remember the fights the two of us had back then?

301
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,040
Arguing who would become Brother's bride.

302
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,560
I remembered saying "You must decide who would be the one tonight." And that placed Lelouch in quite a bind.

303
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,020
How about now?

304
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,740
Eh?

305
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,240
Right now, do you still feel the same about Brother...?

306
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,490
Then, we will soon...

307
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,570
We will soon start!

308
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,960
The making of the world's largest pizza!

309
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,290
By the way, the thing below my feet is an oven specially made for this event.

310
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,750
What a wonderful way of squandering the budget.

311
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,720
I understand, Shirley.

312
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,700
I'll find some time, so go to stage B to help.

313
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,180
Yeah.

314
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,970
This sure is relaxing.

315
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,770
No one will die even if there's a mistake.

316
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,810
As expected from you. Seems like everything will proceed on time.

317
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,190
Lately I've learned how to order people around.

318
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,720
But everyone is really optimistic.

319
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,950
Even though it was only recently that the Chinese Federation came to invade us.

320
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,740
Isn't that why?

321
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,940
Festivals are essential.

322
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,740
No matter who it is, no matter when it is.

323
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,190
You're still naïve.

324
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,860
I'll learn.

325
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,820
Brother.

326
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,460
Nunnally, the pizza is... Ah!

327
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,850
Sorry, I've something to do.

328
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,970
Contact me if something happens.

329
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:55,870
Huh?

330
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,720
The preparation of the ingredients should be done!

331
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,930
Well then, time to introduce this!

332
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,500
The one tossing the pizza will be the Ashford family's Ganymede!

333
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,530
Isn't that grand enough?

334
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:12,750
However! The one piloting it is our student council's disciplinary member and Her Highness Euphemia's knight.

335
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,150
Kururugi Suzaku!

336
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,770
Oh? Could it be...?

337
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,610
Yes. A lot of Elevens came as well.

338
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,880
Since it's an open school festival and it's also the school that Suzaku-san studies in.

339
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,200
Just because of that?

340
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,170
Yes. To the Elevens, Suzaku-san is the star of hope.

341
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,130
I see...

342
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,240
Third generation KnightMare Ganymede.

343
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,100
Queen Marianne, the Flash of Lightning, used this machine, right?

344
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,450
It's just the base frame.

345
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,180
It's just a doll used for events.

346
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,640
It's a unique machine that escaped the era of conflict that followed Queen Marianne's death.

347
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,230
So that was indeed your aim for the marriage.

348
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,720
So you understand?

349
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,450
The person here is not attracted to the opposite gender at all.

350
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,930
Unfortunately, I do possess the basic concept.

351
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,520
Wonderful! How large can he make it?

352
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,750
Suzaku-kun, we are all anticipating it!

353
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,370
I was in charge of that last year.

354
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,040
But I can't compare to a professional.

355
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,530
Today was just filled with surprises.

356
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,390
Lelouch and Nunnally were actually so near,

357
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,620
and are friends with Suzaku.

358
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,050
What is that guy doing...?

359
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,350
This is not the time to be fooling around with girls, right?

360
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,870
I detest that everyone can't be happy.

361
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,140
However, this is the last time we'll ever meet.

362
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,570
No, because I found a good plan.

363
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,360
Lelou...!

364
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,450
Eh? Princess Euphemia?

365
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,880
Someone said "Princess Euphemia"?

366
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,290
Ah? What's wrong?

367
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,320
That person?

368
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,170
It's true! It's Princess Euphemia!

369
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,540
Princess Euphemia is...?!

370
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,480
Lelouch, take Nunnally...

371
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,710
Sorry, I'll do that first.

372
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,380
Yes, seems that the Vice Governor-General is near the main entrance.

373
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,720
Understood. I'm activating the reserve team as well.

374
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,040
Camera, prepare to connect to the studio!

375
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,510
Understood.

376
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,090
I heard that Princess Euphemia came here.

377
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,850
Impossible, why?

378
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,430
Where? Where is she?

379
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,330
It's dangerous, don't run!

380
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,040
If you get pushed down...!

381
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,650
Pizza...

382
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,730
Shouldn't you have left it to the pros right from the start?

383
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,610
Looks like we have to give up on this... Due to various reasons...

384
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,750
Enough already!

385
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,570
What are you trying to do?!

386
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,560
She's the Vice Governor-General, Her Highness the third Princess!

387
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,920
Thanks for the assistance. We'll handle the rest.

388
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,240
I'm from HiTV. Please say something, even one line will do.

389
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,180
Princess Euphemia, I'm Nina!

390
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,510
Please escape this way...!

391
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,670
T-This is a bit...

392
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,390
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

393
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,920
Is that so?

394
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,310
No, it's a great strategy that you're able to escape yourself, Vice-Commander.

395
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,680
I'm not done yet.

396
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,530
Okay.

397
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,240
Looks like the hidden space of the broadcast van won't be used.

398
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,590
There isn't a need for the commander of Team Zero to escape either.

399
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,870
However, I still hope that you will continue to conceal your identity and continue acting secretly in the settlement.

400
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,910
I will one day introduce you to Zero.

401
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,080
I understand.

402
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,790
Eh?

403
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,000
My my my...

404
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,670
Princess Euphemia, are you all right?

405
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,110
Suzaku, thank you.

406
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,420
Nunnally, are you all right?

407
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,000
Yes. What about Sister Euphie?

408
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,020
She's safe. Suzaku saved her.

409
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,350
I see...

410
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,770
Hey, Brother...

411
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,270
Things are going well between Sister Euphie and Suzaku-san.

412
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,030
The two of them... sure match each other.

413
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,240
Nunnally, you...

414
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,830
Thank god they are safe.

415
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,150
Princess Euphemia, please give us your comments.

416
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,610
Can you broadcast this video to all of Area 11?

417
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,090
Huh? A live broadcast?

418
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,220
Euphie?

419
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,140
I have an important announcement to make.

420
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,140
Hmm?

421
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,090
Your Highness!

422
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,520
Princess Euphemia is...!

423
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,310
She did something again?

424
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,290
We are broadcasting an emergency message.

425
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,650
I am Euphemia, the Vice Governor-General of Area 11 of the Holy Imperial Britannian Empire.

426
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,920
There is something important that I want to announce to everyone today.

427
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,110
What? The little lady is making such a big fuss?

428
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:33,620
I, Euphemia Li Britannia, announce the area surrounding Fuji Mountain to be the Specially Administrated Zone of Nippon.

429
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,500
What? Britannia is...?!

430
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,090
Acknowledging... Japan?

431
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,330
Shit!

432
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,190
They actually did that?

433
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,010
Even though it's a restricted region...

434
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,560
In the Specially Administrated Zone of Nippon, Elevens are again able to use the name "Japanese".

435
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,880
The restrictions placed on the Elevens as well as the privileges given to the Britannians

436
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,980
won't apply in the Specially Administrated Zone of Nippon.

437
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,070
Be it Britannians or Elevens, it is a fair world for all!

438
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,410
Stop that, Euphie.

439
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,140
I've thought about that case before.

440
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,880
But that is just a dreamlike story.

441
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,330
Zero, can you hear me?!

442
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,130
I won't unveil your past or your mask.

443
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,500
Thus, please join the Specially Administrated Zone of Nippon!

444
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,390
Zero?

445
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,650
Could it be...? What about Prince Clovis?

446
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,710
What the heck is this?!

447
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,880
Zero, join me and together we shall create a new future from within Britannia!

448
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,140
Long live Princess Euphemia!

449
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,180
Even though she said "Japanese"... But why now?

450
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,290
Look, it's because she has an Eleven boyfriend.

451
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,390
<i>I was defeated.</i>

452
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,880
<i>No matter what I choose, the Order of the Black Knights will be torn apart.</i>

453
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,710
<i>It will lose its raison d'être.</i>

454
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,180
<i>I didn't expect it to be done so easily...</i>

455
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,590
<i>You think you will obtain everything just by doing that?</i>

456
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,290
<i>Even providing us with a place to live?</i>

457
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,380
<i>Then you didn't see or hear anything!</i>

458
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,440
<i>I'm a terrorist that hides his face.</i>

459
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,050
<i>While you're...</i>

460
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,260
<i>Lelouch, we can go back to how it used to be.</i>

461
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,570
<i>No, it's different from how it used to be!</i>

462
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,930
<i>Euphemia!</i>

463
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,450
The Specially Administrated Zone of Nippon.

464
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,560
If I cooperate with them, my military power will be taken away.

465
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,320
If I rebel against them, the people will become my enemy.

466
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,780
The Order of the Black Knights will collapse here.

467
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,450
Euphemia,

468
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,360
the third Princess who innocently brandishes kindness.

469
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,130
To Nunnally and I...

470
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,130
Your existence is a sin!

471
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:16,130
