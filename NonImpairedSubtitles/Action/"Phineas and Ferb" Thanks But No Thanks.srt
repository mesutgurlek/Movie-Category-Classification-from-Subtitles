If you'll just be so kind as to
move your tail out of the way.

157
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,543
Thank you. There we go.
That's good.

158
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,179
(STAMMERS) See, now you're
just being childish.

159
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,583
Look, I promise you, I'm not
even being marginally evil.

160
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,918
I just want to stop that guy
from playing his bagpipes.

161
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,521
Every day, 24 hours a day.
I mean, look at him!

162
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,058
On what planet is that
racket considered music?

163
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,559
Ugh, I cannot
take it anymore

164
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,263
so I'm gonna hit his bagpipe
with my Inflatinator.

165
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,434
Yeah, I know, it's basically the
opposite of my old Deflatinator.

166
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,269
But I can't concentrate
with all that noise.

167
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,937
I was lucky to
come up with that.

168
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,472
But when that
bagpipe blows up,

169
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,409
I will once again be able to
hear the usual din ringing

170
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,977
through the city streets.

171
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,479
Like car alarms
and babies crying.

172
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,314
And inators blowing up.

Go on, go on.
Tell my mom everything!

175
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,924
Well, when the empty
window feels like talking,

176
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:06,992
you let me know.

177
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,262
There it is.
I dropped my penny.

178
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,063
Did you say
something, dear?

179

MONTY: How was your meal, Dad?

180
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,001
Absolutely delicious.

181
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,035
What a great
new place.

182
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,004
I know, right?
Carl found it.

183
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,139
Well, then. Let me
just say, thank you,

184
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,307
to the chef.

185
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,342
Thank you, for
that delicious meal.

186
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,078
You're most welcome.
So glad you enjoyed it.

187
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,282
Dad, isn't there something you
wanted to say to Carl, as well.

188
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,951
Of course.
What was I thinking?

189
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,453
Don't be rude, Carl.
Thank the chef.

Thank you.

191

I like this table. And to show my
gratitude, dessert is on the house.

192
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,594
Now, if you'll excuse me. I must
go and fire a member of staff.

193
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,063
Luchenzo, come here!

194
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,567
There, you see? A little
gratitude goes a long way.

195
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,602
Pay attention, Carl.
You could learn something.

196
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,170
Really learn
something from you...

197
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,172
Just chill out.
I got another idea.

have this helipad installed.

No really. I swear, the old
lady is there in the window

208
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,770
right now. I swear!

209
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,106
No need to swear.

Funny, Candace, I could
swear your old lady

a houseplant.

getting anywhere.

take a time out?

of a platypus smells like.

was disturbing you.

have overthought

that solution
just a little bit.

Don't worry, Carl. Once
you save my dad's life,

00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,575
there's no way even he could
avoid thanking you for it.

I hope for your
sake you're right.

how no one's noticed

a grand piano dangling
precariously over our table.

Well, I also tied up a
couple of violins over there

243
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:47,785
so it would seem
like a theme.

All right, listen.
So when my dad returns,

245
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,723
I'll excuse myself
and cut the rope

246
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,759
and you push my dad out of the way
of the falling piano. Got it?

Well, let's get to
that dessert menu.

Excuse me, Dad.
It's my turn.

00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,864
I'll be right back.
You guys start.

for not making us wait.

He gave me mints
and some floss.

thank him enough.

Wow, Carl. You saved
my dad's life.

259
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,189
Yes. It's a shame he
couldn't save the table too.

Aren't you going
to thank him?

Oh, well, I didn't
realize, I hadn't.

Thank you for pointing
that out to me, Monty.

311
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:23,984
You're not the only one
with a book club, you know.

312
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,786
I like your idea
about the tea, though.

313
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:26,786
Ferb, make
a note of that.

314
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,890
The war started because Paris
fell in love with Helen of Troy.

315
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:30,690
It's so romantic.

316
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:34,962
Yeah, and Helen could launch a
thousand ships with her face!

317
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,597
My favorite character
was Achilles,

318
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,832
the greatest Greek
warrior of all time.

319
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,601
He had this big
fight with Hector.

320
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:42,436
He was all,
wham! Bam!

321
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:43,737
Stab! Stab! Stab!
Cut it out!

322
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,706
Isn't there something
about a wooden horse?

323
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,609
Yeah, the Greek army built
a huge wooden horse

324
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,911
and left it outside
the gates of Troy.

325
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:53,280
<i>The Trojans thought that</i>
<i>the Greeks had given up</i>

326
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:55,549
<i>and that the horse was</i>
<i>some sort of tribute to them.</i>

327
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:56,549
So, they wheeled
it inside the gates.

328
00:12:56,551 --> 00:13:00,420
Hey. How did they get that
big horse in that tiny door?

329
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:02,890
Buford, just try
imaging a larger door.

330
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:04,458
Oh, okay. Hang on.

331
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:06,492
Oh, yeah.
That's better.

332
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,596
Then late at night, the Greeks climbed
out of the horse, opened the gates...

333
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:11,832
Then it was all, wham,
zam, stab, stab, stab.

334
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:12,900
Cut it out!

335
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:14,701
Wow, really
sounds exciting.

336
00:13:14,703 --> 00:13:15,401
I better
get started.

337
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,938
Book club is in
three hours. Bye!

338
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,073
Wow. She must
be a fast reader.

339
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:21,608
What gets me is,

340
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,477
why did the Trojan
War take so long?

341
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,746
If I were Achilles, I could
have taken the city of Troy

342
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,548
like in one afternoon.

343
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,683
Ferb, I know what
we're gonna do today!

344
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,819
We're gonna finally
recreate the Trojan War.

345
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:34,354
I'll be Paris because my
name starts with a "P."

346
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,789
And I'll be
Helen because

347
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,692
uh, my name
starts with "I"

348
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,928
which is right
after "H."

349
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:43,063
And I'll be the
great Achilles!

350
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:45,065
And I'll be all wham,
zam, stab, stab, stab.

351
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,700
(SCREAMS)
Cut it out!

352
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,635
And you can be Hector.
Now get over there.

353
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:49,770
I'm taking Ferb.

354
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:51,972
Hey everyone, can I play?
BUFORD: No!

355
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:53,607
I've got baklava.

356
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:55,342

Hey, where's

359
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,949

Ha! You missed me,
Perry the Platypus!

393
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,879
But I got you!

394
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:41,882
You see, I was just doing a little
inventory and reorganization

395
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:45,619
of all the stuff that I've
collected over the last 40 years.

396
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:49,222
Yeah, I know it's gotten
a little out of hand.

397
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:52,492
I kinda let it go and Norm's
been in Maui for, like, a month.

398
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,927
So I made
the De-clutterinator.

399
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,996
I was actually gonna
shoot myself with it,

400
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,966
which would make me want to
unclutter everything, and,

401
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:01,134
uh, then I lost it,
'cause, you know, it's...

402
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:02,703
It's really cluttered
in here.

403
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,571
So then I hired a nice
young lady named Doreen

404
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:07,741
to help me get organized, and, well, I
think she may have gotten lost, too.

405
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:09,543
I haven't seen her in days.

406

Doreen, are you out there?

DOREEN: Food.

410
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:21,822
So, if you'll excuse me, I have to
get back to my search for Doreen.

411
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:25,025
Maybe I'll get lucky and find
the De-clutterinator, too.

00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:24,878
And for 10 years
they were all...

465
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,014
♪ Stabbing, and jabbing,
and clashing, and gashing,

466
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,151
♪ And brawling, and mauling,
and trashing, and smashing

they couldn't take 'em by force</i>

472
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,803
You know, bagpipes are sort of
anachronistic for this time...

473
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:51,705
Quiet, you! Go back
to being vanquished.

474

00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:16,129
I should have brought some
bread crumbs or something

482
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:17,898
to leave behind me
so I could find my way...

483
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,433
Oh, you know what? Better yet, I
should have brought a sandwich,

484
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:21,835

Hey, where you guys going?
We're not done yet.

I've got
a balalaika lesson.

00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,750
You know, they've got a word
for what you guys are doing.

490
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:38,852
Yeah. It's desertion.
No, it's...

491
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:40,320
Oh, no.
It is desertion.

492
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:41,688
Irving, get over here.

493
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,790
It's time to execute Plan B.
Plan B?

494
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:46,459
Yeah, you know the one where you
climb into the decoy and, uh...

495
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,395
Oh, that Plan B.
Get going.

496
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,299
A Trojan platypus?

497
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:54,768
Come on, Buford, what makes
you think we'd fall for that.

498
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,103
IRVING: I told you,
Buford. (YELLS)

499
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:59,172
Why did you have me
get in this thing?

500
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:00,874
Now, we're getting somewhere.

501
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:03,476
Ha! I bet you didn't
see a Trojan T. rex

502
00:20:03,478 --> 00:20:06,446
with laser-cannon mouth and
laser eyes comin', did you?

503
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:07,780
Well, he's got me there.

504
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:10,784
Seriously, if you were just gonna
crush the Trojan platypus,

505
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:12,719
why did I... Leave me
my simple pleasures.

506
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:14,421
Now, Ferb,
destroy Troy!

507
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:16,723
This is why I got
Ferb on my team!

508
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:18,291
(GASPS)

509
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:21,962
Uh-oh. Looks like
Ferb's goin' off book.

510
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:23,129
Everyone to
the chariots!

511
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:24,998
Hang on!

512
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:34,040
Whoa-ho! Laser-proof.
Nice touch, Ferb.

513
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,110
(YELLING)

514
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:39,512
This is really cool.

515
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:42,515
Book club starts
in 10 minutes.

516
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:46,353
I have an idea! Throw that
rope to the other chariot!

517
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:50,256
Well, that
can't be good.

518
00:20:50,258 --> 00:20:54,260
I guess they knew a T. rex's
weakness is also its Achilles' heel.

519
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,528
(SCREAMING)

520
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,534
That was awesome!

521
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:02,568
Who won?

522
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,537
This time I think
it was a draw.

523
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,506
Come on, let's go tell
Candace how it ends.

524
00:21:06,508 --> 00:21:08,074
Yeah, and maybe we
can pick up some

525
00:21:08,076 --> 00:21:09,809
Greek frozen
yogurt on the way.

526
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:13,246
Doreen, come on,
quit kidding around.

527
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:14,848
(GASPS)
Perry the Platypus?

528
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,283
You've found the
De-clutterinator!

529
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:17,550
Excellent,
okay, shoot me.

530
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:19,486
Shoot me and I'll clean
this whole place up.

531
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,286
Oh wait.
(STAMMERS) What?

532
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:23,322
Oh, it's not plugged in.
Hold on one sec.

533
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,225
My, word! What a mess.

534
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:27,427
Okay, here's an open socket.

535
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:29,396
That doesn't sound good.

536
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:30,497
(EXPLOSION)

537
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,803
Oof, I say, I feel the
sudden urge to declutter.

538
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,975
Well, you have to admit it
did get rid of the clutter.

539
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:43,209
There you are.

540
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:44,844
Doreen!
What's happening?

541
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,914
My invoice. You'll be
hearing from my lawyer.

542
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,949
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!

543
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:53,286
And there goes
the last of it!

544
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,458
Lawrence, what are
you doing out here?

545
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,593
Oh, you know, just
tidying up a little.

546
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:02,395
Well, the yard
looks great!

547
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:03,395
Come on in the kitchen.

548
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:05,298
I've got a plate of cake
that needs cleaning up.

549
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,566
I'm your man.

550
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,205
Now that we're all here.
Who wants to go first.

551
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,974
Ooh, me! In general I thought
the Greeks' decoy platypus

552
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:17,977
was a brilliant idea until it
got smashed by the T. rex!

553
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:20,113
Its use of lasers to
destroy the city of Troy

554
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:23,516
really seemed unbeatable until Paris
flew down in his laser chariot.

555
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:26,119
The flying chariots were
all, pew, pew, pew, pew!

556
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:27,354
Ga, ga, ga, ga!

557
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:29,122
And... (IMITATES
BOMBS FALLING) Cool!

558
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:30,924
<i>The Iliad </i> is truly an epic!

559
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:33,493
Candace, you didn't
read the book, did you?

560
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:34,560
I'm so busted.

561
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,730
Oh, that's okay. I don't
think anyone did.

562
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:38,865
I just come to book
club for the tea.
