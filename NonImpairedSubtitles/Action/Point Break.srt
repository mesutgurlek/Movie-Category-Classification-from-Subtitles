1
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,037
100%, Utah!

2
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,509
Good job!

3
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,756
Hi! Johnny Utah.

4
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,038
Your 9 o'clock appointment is here.

5
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,796
Special Agent John Utah,
day number one in LA. Welcome aboard.

6
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,110
- Your record's impressive.
- Thank you.

7
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,760
You may have been
in the top 2% of your class at Quantico...

8
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,799
...but out here you have exactly
zero hours of experience in the field.

9
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,677
You know nothing,
in fact, less than nothing.

10
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,957
If you knew you knew nothing,
that'd be something, but you don't.

11
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,552
Yes, sir.

12
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,119
- You eat a solid breakfast?
- Sir?

13
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,033
All food groups, avoiding caffeine, sugar?

14
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,749
I like my people to be fit. We don't drink
and we sure as hell don't smoke!

15
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,798
- Sir, I take the skin off chicken.
- Good man!

16
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,873
This is us - Bank Robbery.

17
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,474
You are now
in the world's bank robbery capital.

18
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,996
<i>1,322 last year in LA County.
Up 26% from the year before.</i>

19
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,719
That's correct.
We nailed over 1,000 of them.

20
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,473
Miss Deer,
take a look at that for me. Thank you.

21
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,916
D'you know
how we nail the bad guys, Utah?

22
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,913
By crunching data,
good crime-scene work, good lab work...

23
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,833
...and, most importantly,
good data-based analysis.

24
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,708
Special Agent Utah,
are you receiving my signal?

25
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,954
Zero distortion, sir.

26
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,874
I love these things.

27
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,873
You're a real blue-flame special, son:
Young, dumb and full of cum. I know.

28
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,148
What I don't know is how you got yourself
assigned out here to LA with us.

29
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,958
I mean, hell...

30
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,032
...I guess we must have
ourselves an asshole shortage, huh?

31
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,831
Not so far.

32
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,597
OK...

33
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,511
- Pappas?
- Yeah?

34
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,515
Put on the blindfold. I want to see you
retrieve at least two bricks off the bottom.

35
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,795
One...

36
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,997
...two.

37
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,078
I've been in the field 22 years...

38
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,197
...I've fired my piece
over 19 times in the line of duty.

39
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,909
I got no idea what a blind man fetching
bricks from the bottom of the pool...

40
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,355
...has got to do with being a special agent.

41
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,719
Added to which indignity, I have been
saddled with a blue-flame Quantico cat!

42
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,316
Some quarterback punk.
Johnny Unitas or something.

43
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,437
- The shit they pull, huh?
- Yeah!

44
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,239
Hey, Angie? Here's your guy!

45
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,595
What?

46
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,628
<i>Uh... Pappas. Angelo Pappas.</i>

47
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,312
Punk. Quarterback punk.

48
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,196
Hm.

49
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,111
Welcome to SeaWorld, kid.

50
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,715
<i>Good luck, Pappas.</i>

51
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,116
Two bricks, comin' up.

52
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,154
Little hand says it's time to rock and roll.

53
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,596
- Everybody freeze!
- Nobody move! Hands up and eyes down!

54
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,190
Back away from the counters!
Hands on your heads now!

55
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,071
Everybody, onto the floor!
Move it! Move it!

56
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,637
- Now! Get down!
- What's the matter with you people?

57
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,836
You, outta the cubicle. Get outta my way!

58
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,871
Back away and get your fuckin' hands up!

59
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,270
Hey, what's the matter with you?
You got earwax?

60
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,194
Back away! Keep your hands
where I can see 'em! Hands up!

61
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,717
Hello, hello, ladies and gentlemen.
We are the Ex-Presidents!

62
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,234
We need just a few moments of your time.

63
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,710
We've been screwing you for years,
so a few more seconds shouldn't matter!

64
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,271
On the floor, asshole! The money's
insured so it's not worth dying for!

65
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,035
How you doin', Dick?

66
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,396
Implementing our personal plan
of deregulation, Mr President!

67
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,751
<i>Time, Mr Carter!</i>

68
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,397
Sixty!

69
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,198
- LBJ?
- We're stylin'!

70
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,395
Oh, Ron, I got Nancy on the line!

71
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,509
Air Force One is waiting, Mr President.

72
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,352
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

73
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,799
Get your hands
where I can fuckin' see 'em! Thank you.

74
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,668
Thank you very much.
And, please, don't forget to vote!

75
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,318
I'm not a crook!

76
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,358
<i>27 banks in three years.</i>

77
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,635
God. In and out in 90 seconds!

78
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,275
No-one ever gets shot.
Now, what are we talking about here?

79
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,954
We're talking about solid professionals!

80
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,155
Good moves.

81
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,837
Yeah, they control the room well
and they stick strictly to the cash drawers.

82
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,672
They don't go for the vault?

83
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,797
No. They never go for the vault.
They never get greedy.

84
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,950
Smart. You burn time in the vault.

85
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,315
Reagan usually does the driving.

86
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,951
Stolen switch car, they leave it running.
It looks parked from a distance.

87
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,033
When they run,
they dump the vehicle and they vanish.

88
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,917
Like a virgin on prom night.

89
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,797
I mean, they vanish! Pshht!

90
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,070
Surgical.
Look at them separate the dye pack.

91
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,991
Dick and Ronnie know their jobs.

92
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,356
The Ex-Presidents
are the best I've ever seen.

93
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,956
Any time you two've finished jerking off,
watching MTV, we need to see the tapes.

94
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,715
Pappas, you tell the kid
your theory on the Presidents?

95
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,516
Just take the tapes and go, Babbit.

96
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,798
Hang ten, Pappas. Like totally rad, dude!

97
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,991
I tell ya, the department loves it.

98
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,036
What's he talking about, Angelo?

99
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,715
- Found the drop car on Mulholland Drive.
- We'll go work it.

100
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,791
<i>Oh, no!</i>

101
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,075
Angelo?

102
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,275
Come on!

103
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,113
Thank you. We'll go work it.

104
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,030
Good.

105
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,109
Excuse me.

106
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,788
I'm working a fuckin' drop car!
I don't believe it. Working a drop car!

107
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,348
Pappas - what a hard-on!

108
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,838
<i>- Keep away from there.
- All right.</i>

109
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,153
This car doesn't have AC.
Today was a scorcher.

110
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,674
Sweat secretions in the seatbacks.

111
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,032
Are you through, Mr Wizard?

112
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,908
Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa
under the seat while you're at it!

113
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,598
<i>Oh, look at this!
It's 7.30. The night is still young.</i>

114
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,593
The way you're going, you'll be able
to solve this case and start another one.

115
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,069
Drop car, my ass! Goddamn!

116
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,593
You been working Bank Robbery,
what, 22 years?

117
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,240
Yeah, 22 years.

118
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,276
LA has changed a lot during that time.

119
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,396
The air got dirty and the sex got clean.

120
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,870
A guy with that much time in
must have a theory about these guys.

121
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,871
Leave it alone, Johnny.

122
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,635
OK, fine, you've given up, fine.
It doesn't mean I have to.

123
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,998
Hey! Listen, forget about it, kid.
They are ghosts.

124
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,710
<i>Of course. If you couldn't crack it
with all your years of experience...</i>

125
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,156
...it's impossible to think
I might have something to offer!

126
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,993
<i>Maybe I can do better
than an over-the-hill burnout.</i>

127
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,115
Watch your mouth!

128
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,196
Maybe you should just retire, get some
rent-a-cop nightjob and tell 'Nam stories!

129
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,912
Listen! I was taking shrapnel in 'Nam
while you were crapping in your hands!

130
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,991
- You mad?
- Yeah, I'm mad.

131
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,069
Good and mad?

132
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,948
- Yeah. What you wanna do about it?
- Feels good, like you're still alive?

133
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,756
Yeah!

134
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,799
Well, since you're still alive
and you're not in the box just yet...

135
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,112
...why don't you tell me this theory
of yours and we'll go get these guys?

136
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,718
OK, hotshot.

137
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,152
You wanna nail the bank robbers
and be a big hero?

138
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,435
- Definitely!
- Definitely.

139
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,999
Then here it is.

140
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,589
The Ex-Presidents...

141
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,028
...are surfers.

142
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,469
Surfers.

143
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,959
Surfers.

144
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,714
It's in our face.

145
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,275
Look at the tan line on this guy.

146
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,191
<i>Oh, well, he must be a surfer!</i>

147
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,829
Well, yeah.

148
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,277
Last year, Nixon scuffs the counter
when he's going over...

149
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,912
...so there is a soil sample.

150
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,752
Non-specific mud.
Traces of asphalt, traces of oil.

151
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,513
Traces of sand. Carnuba wax.

152
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,390
So I become a wax expert.
Now, there's 80-some uses for this stuff.

153
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,277
Something like 500 products.

154
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,158
Candle wax, car wax, moustache wax.

155
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,279
Could be anything.

156
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,029
Guy's waxing his moustache
at the beach, gets sand in it...

157
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,111
...takes it off with a shoe.

158
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,872
Shoe scuffs the counter...

159
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,033
Would you just shut up a minute!
Listen! Maybe you'll learn something.

160
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,793
The lab gave us three possible matches.

161
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,199
This is one of them.

162
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,711
- Sex Wax!
- Yeah.

163
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,791
You're not into kinky shit, are you?

164
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,714
Not yet! Surfers use this.
They rub it on their boards for traction.

165
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,074
Thanks for the tip.

166
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,674
You're welcome for the tip.
Here's another.

167
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,911
Check out the dates on these robberies.

168
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,958
It's strictly a summerjob for these idiots.

169
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,033
Four months.

170
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,598
June to October.

171
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,909
- Same the year before.
- That's right. We have one more month.

172
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,709
We won't see 'em till next summer.

173
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,710
They're traveling on the money,
going where the waves are.

174
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,719
That's right!

175
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,354
The Ex-Presidents rip off banks
to finance their endless summer!

176
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,759
<i>Whoa!</i>

177
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,830
Hey, man,
a lot of guys your age are learning to surf.

178
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,117
- It's cool. There's nothing wrong in it.
- I'm 25.

179
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,668
That's what I'm saying. It's never too late.

180
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,992
<i>Hope you stick with it.</i>

181
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,833
Surfing's the source.
It can change your life.

182
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,076
<i>Why can't I just walk around
with this thing under my arm...</i>

183
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,714
...and act stoned, ask a few questions?

184
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,437
Well...

185
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,714
...look.

186
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,678
Look at 'em.
They're like some kinda tribe.

187
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,432
They got their own language.

188
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,317
You can’t just walk up to those guys.

189
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,269
You gotta get out there, learn the moves,
get into their head, pick up the speech.

190
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,079
You saying
the FBI is going to pay me to learn to surf?

191
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,720
It's either you or me on the board.
Get my drift?

192
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,473
This is for rubber people
who don't shave yet.

193
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,509
Come on. You're the quarterback jock.
It's all balance, right? And co-ordination.

194
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,393
<i>How hard can it be?</i>

195
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,791
<i>Hold on!</i>

196
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,996
Hold on.

197
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,832
Use your arms. Paddle. Come on!

198
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,794
It's all right. Come on. You're OK.

199
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,797
You crazy son of a bitch.

200
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,838
You wanna commit suicide,
you do it someplace else!

201
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,120
This pig-board piece of shit!

202
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,309
You got no business out here whatsoever!

203
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,153
Hey!

204
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,356
My name's Johnny Utah!

205
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,431
Who cares?!

206
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,390
<i>That is your surfing contact?</i>

207
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,189
"Female, blue eyes, black hair...

208
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,715
...five foot six, 119 pounds."

209
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,233
God, Utah!

210
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,356
Not bad, Utah!

211
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,433
<i>Tyler Ann Endicott, born 27.11.64.</i>

212
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,998
<i>Exhibition of speed...</i>

213
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,269
<i>... indecent exposure
inside moving vehicle...</i>

214
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,316
Hot, very hot!

215
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,392
What else they got on her?

216
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,359
I still haven't found anything I can use.
I gotta find an approach. A way in.

217
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,431
Here we go!

218
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,670
Both parents deceased.

219
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,913
Aeroplane crash, San Diego, '84.

220
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,390
Yeah.

221
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,789
Definitely.

222
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,071
See ya later.

223
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,315
Next?

224
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,079
What do you want?

225
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,115
Shrimp and fries.

226
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,639
I mean, what do you want?
Why d'you keep hanging around?

227
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,948
I need you to teach me.

228
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,996
Gimme a break. Shrimp and fries...

229
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,397
...to go!

230
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,553
Would you like
something to drink with that, sir?

231
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,996
- I'm serious!
- I can see that you're serious. Forget it.

232
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,551
Stick to... tennis.

233
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,551
I don't know, whatever you do good.

234
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,870
<i>Miniature golf. Your number's 37.</i>

235
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,868
You don't understand.
I'm gonna learn to surf or break my neck.

236
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,398
What is it? You all of a sudden got this bug
that you just have to go surfing?

237
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,799
This is a line, right?

238
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,075
No! No.

239
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,796
See...

240
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,274
My whole life
I've done things for other people.

241
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,557
In high school I played football
because my old man expected me to.

242
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,311
Mm-hm.

243
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,392
Then my parents
always figured I'd go to law school.

244
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,755
So I did. Football scholarship.

245
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,479
- Is this gonna take a long time?
- Wait.

246
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,029
So I'm a big hero to my folks, right?

247
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,551
But two years ago
they were killed in a car wreck.

248
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,399
You can't imagine it.
Your whole life changes.

249
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,199
And I suddenly realized
that all my goals had been their goals...

250
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,592
...and I hadn't been living my own life,
so I wanted something for myself.

251
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,708
So I come out here
from Ohio a month ago.

252
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,720
I'd never seen the ocean before. Any ocean.

253
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,918
I never thought
it would affect me so much.

254
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,514
I'm drawn to it.

255
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,549
Or something.

256
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,716
I want to do what you do.

257
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,314
It's the truth.

258
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,838
All right.

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,035
OK. Tomorrow.

260
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,189
Here.

261
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,679
6am!

262
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,998
If you are one minute late, I'm gone.

263
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,514
And, stud,
I didn't take you on to raise, so...

264
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,390
...I'll teach you a few things and then
after that you'll be on your own, OK?

265
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,789
God!

266
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,235
<i>Stop here.</i>

267
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,114
You agree to do
exactly what I say when I say it?

268
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,871
Sure.

269
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,991
Pop!

270
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,310
Pop!

271
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,473
You stand straight up,
you'll just fall over, so let's try it again.

272
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,711
Start over. Just do it again.

273
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,316
Hey! What ya doin'?

274
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,072
Just do it again. Pop up.

275
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,310
<i>Stay low, you're gonna bite it.</i>

276
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,073
You dragged your knee. You'll wipe out.

277
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,754
You're dragging your foot,
you're gonna be fish food.

278
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,389
Both feet have to land
on the board at the same time.

279
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,110
That's it. That's it. You're surfing.

280
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,196
Shit!

281
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,115
Doing all right, city boy!

282
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,792
Whoo!

283
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,839
You are surfing!

284
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,917
That's Bodhi.

285
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,632
They call him the Bodhisattva.

286
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,989
He's a modern savage.

287
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,633
He's a real searcher.

288
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,918
- What's he searching for?
- The ride! The ultimate ride.

289
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,795
The guy's even crazier than you, Johnny.

290
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,715
Hey!

291
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,472
Heads up!

292
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,229
<i>Hey!</i>

293
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,513
Put me down!

294
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,473
Uh, we know each other.

295
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,234
That's a... a surf board, all right.

296
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,788
Looks like a '57 Chevy I used to have!

297
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,477
Tyler, come here.

298
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,954
So, who's the guy? You replace me?

299
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,989
Give me a break. Where you been?

300
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,832
He surfs real well

301
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,990
Come on!
He's from Kansas or something.

302
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,911
- He's from Kansas?
- Heads up!

303
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,314
<i>Yeah!</i>

304
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,799
Good catch.

305
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,075
Ready!

306
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,354
Set!

307
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,994
Hut! Hut! Go, let's go, go!

308
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,629
Hut!

309
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,589
Hut!

310
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,269
Hut!

311
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,751
Whose ball is it? Who wants it?

312
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,349
Hut!

313
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,396
Get him!

314
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,469
Get him!

315
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,359
Ready!

316
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,078
Set!

317
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,637
Hut!

318
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,634
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Don't you think that's a little out of line?

319
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,712
- Cool it, Roach. Know who this is?
- No, I don't!

320
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,475
This is Johnny Utah, Ohio State Buckeyes,
all conference. Remember?

321
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,754
Number 9, how ya doing?

322
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,118
Jesus Christ! Johnny fuckin' Utah!
Sorry, man. Didn't mean to get in ya face!

323
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,431
I knew I knew you. It was the Rose Bowl.
Three years ago you beat SC.

324
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,112
- You? You did this?
- Yep, him!

325
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,589
- That was one hell of a game.
- No shit.

326
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,433
Yeah, but you got nuked in the last quarter.

327
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,910
Yeah, I got my knee folded back
about 90 degrees the wrong way!

328
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,993
- Whoa! That's why you never went pro?
- Two years of surgery, missed my window.

329
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,513
Went to law school instead.

330
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,871
Law school! You're a lawyer?

331
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,989
Wow!

332
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,558
Well, life's not over yet, man.
You're surfing.

333
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,191
<i>- Lawyers don't surf!
- This one does.</i>

334
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,909
<i>Let's play some football!</i>

335
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,633
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job
flipping burgers at the local drive-in!

336
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,191
Yes, the surfboard bothers me.

337
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,918
Yes, your approach
to this whole damn case bothers me.

338
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,718
And, yes, YOU BOTHER ME!

339
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,270
And, Pappas, for the love of Christ...

340
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,911
...just how the hell did I ever let you
talk me into this boneheaded idea?

341
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,788
Harp, we're working undercover.
It takes time. We've produced...

342
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,351
No, no, no, no!
Let me tell you what you've produced.

343
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,513
Over the last two weeks
you two have produced exactly squat.

344
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,995
SQUAT!

345
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,676
During which time the Ex-Presidents
have robbed two more banks!

346
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,478
Now, for Christ's sake...

347
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,270
...does either one of you have anything
even remotely interesting to tell me?

348
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,871
Caught my first tube this morning... sir!

349
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,516
Goddamn it!
Why didn't you leave that thing in the car?

350
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,397
It sticks out so I can't lock it.

351
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,916
Anyway, what's his problem?
We're handling our caseload.

352
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,675
- I'm surfing on my own time.
- I know, just don't rub Harp's nose in it.

353
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,035
You think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?

354
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,556
This was your lame idea.
You gotta back me up on this.

355
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,712
Johnny, we better
come up with something real quick.

356
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,791
- My friend...
- What?

357
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,272
Encino Savings and Loan.
Guard grabbed LBJ's ponytail.

358
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,956
28 robberies and what do we get from it?
One fucking hair.

359
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,758
<i>Angelo, pay attention.</i>

360
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,035
There's gonna be a test afterward.

361
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,753
Lab is showing traces of toxins
in the hair. Selenium, titanium, arsenic.

362
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,112
Beaches are always being closed
because of waste spills.

363
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,398
And surfers are territorial.
They stick mostly to certain breaks.

364
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,711
If we can get hair samples
and get a match at a certain beach...

365
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,713
...we'd know
which break the Ex-Presidents surf.

366
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,712
You buying this?

367
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,510
No!

368
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,669
No.

369
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,910
But let's do it, anyway.

370
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,389
It will bug the shit out of Harp.

371
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,912
- My man!
- Yeah!

372
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,397
Hey! When you two are done
making out, I need to talk to you.

373
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,155
- What's this? Narco entrapment, dude?
- Not exactly, dude.

374
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,195
Shit.

375
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,669
Making a wig for my girlfriend.
Thank you.

376
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,355
Fuckin' guy's a narc, man.

377
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,555
Dude cut my hair!

378
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,959
So what? He didn't bust us.

379
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,678
He fuckin' cut my hair!

380
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,710
Hey, don't move! Got some huge sucker
crawling right into your ear!

381
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,918
Got it!

382
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,230
Leave some fuckin' hair, man!

383
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,309
What is it?

384
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,393
Saved your life, bro. Close one!

385
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,192
PCBs, selenium, titanium, arsenic.

386
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,917
The percentages look right.

387
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,189
Here's a match.

388
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,669
- There's a match?
- Latigo Beach.

389
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,638
Nice point break. Long workable rides.

390
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,909
Surf's up, Ace!

391
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,231
Stay off my wave!

392
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,717
Goons trying to drop in.

393
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,909
Paddle! Paddle! Paddle!

394
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,191
Out of the way, you shit!

395
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,189
Hey!

396
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,798
You dinged my board!

397
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,792
Why don't you watch
where the fuck you're going!

398
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,871
Politeness counts, asshole!

399
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,196
Go back to the Valley, man!

400
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,474
<i>Angelo, I've eaten shit 47 times and got
my lights punched out by some psycho.</i>

401
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,750
<i>There must be 20 guys here with ponytails.</i>

402
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,831
Patience, hotshot. Patience.

403
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,311
It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
They'll be a group within the group.

404
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,393
These guys are a real tight unit.
You'll see 'em, you'll know it.

405
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,476
This the guy?

406
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,196
Yeah.

407
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,832
OK...

408
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,990
...I know.

409
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,829
This is where you tell me
all about how locals rule...

410
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,391
...and yuppie insects like me
shouldn't be surfing your break, right?

411
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,750
Nope!

412
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,309
That would be a waste of time.

413
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,191
We're just gonna fuck you up.

414
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,716
Oh.

415
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,508
<i>Johnny, are you there?</i>

416
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,955
<i>You better not
be trying to pick up any babes!</i>

417
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,275
Hit him! Yeah! Harder! Yeah!

418
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,957
Back off! He's with me!

419
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,469
Kiss my ass!

420
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,312
Back off. Seriously.

421
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,110
Thank you.

422
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,433
Stay out of this, Bodhi.

423
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,635
What's your name?

424
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,755
Bunker.

425
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,875
Bunker. Well, listen, Bunker.
I'm actually really glad you found me.

426
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,518
Yeah, why?

427
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,079
Shit!

428
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,918
Come on!

429
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,310
This is stimulating,
but we're outta here. Let's go, Utah.

430
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,639
Just keep walking.

431
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,912
Oh!? Uh... Oh! OK

432
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,670
You two guys seen a kid
run through here with a car stereo?

433
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,670
He stole it from me.

434
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,309
No, but there's four guys
back there you might wanna check out!

435
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,992
Thanks, buddy!

436
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,878
- Hope you find him.
- Don't worry, I will.

437
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,790
You like to start shit, don't you?

438
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,911
Who are those guys?

439
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,115
Nazi assholes.

440
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,760
The guy you dropped is Bunker Weiss...

441
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,912
...the big one is War Child,
AKA Lupton Pitman.

442
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,790
And the other two think they're
some kind of death squad around here.

443
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,233
What's their programme?

444
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,709
Brains are wired wrong,
they're into bad shit.

445
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,119
Like what? Illegal shit?

446
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,079
Maybe, I don't know.
That's not what I'm talking about.

447
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,957
They only live to get radical.

448
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,670
They don't understand the sea,
so they'll never get the spiritual side of it.

449
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,752
You're not gonna
start chanting or anything, are ya?!

450
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,831
<i>I might!</i>

451
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,319
This is me.

452
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,349
So, uh, you still haven't figured out
what riding waves is all about, have you?

453
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,233
It's a state of mind.

454
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,278
It's that place
where you lose yourself and find yourself.

455
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,590
You don't know it yet, but you've got it.

456
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,071
I saw you with those guys, you're a pit bull.
They didn't back you down an inch.

457
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,118
- And that is very rare in this world.
- Thanks for stepping in.

458
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,633
De nada! Later!

459
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,232
Oh, hey. I'm having some people over
at my house tonight if you wanna come.

460
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,116
Sure. Where?

461
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,589
- Come with Tyler. She knows.
- All right.

462
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,511
Next time you leave your piece
and shield in the car, stay in sight! OK?

463
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,157
OK, Dad.

464
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,753
Yeah, I need you to run a plate for me.

465
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,799
Two Denver four Sam
niner five niner, late-Seventies Jeep.

466
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,553
The jeep belongs to a Bunker Weiss,
my buddy. Guy's got quite a sheet.

467
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,518
Yeah. Skip all that.
Give me the greatest hits.

468
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,071
Felony: Possession of cocaine - good.
Felony: B&E - three months in juvey.

469
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,950
Felony: Assault - postgraduate work
at Chino. Excellent! I'm loving it!

470
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,193
<i>These guys really fit the profile.</i>

471
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,637
I say we lay it on Harp.

472
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,916
<i>Here comes the night shift.</i>

473
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,191
This is bullshit. This is a bullshit lead.
This is totally bullshit.

474
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,556
Harp must be fuckin' desperate
if he's listening to you two flakes.

475
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,517
See you bright and early, guys.

476
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,431
Yeah, right

477
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,838
Cold pizza for you.
It's good for breakfast. See you.

478
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,589
<i>When did Harp say
we'd get the warrant?</i>

479
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,229
First thing. Get some sleep.
This could be an interesting morning.

480
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,072
- Hey!
- Hey, Bodhi.

481
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,551
I taught him that trick.

482
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,671
I like it!

483
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,513
Watch yourself. She's a wild one.

484
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,717
Make yourself at home.
What's mine is yours.

485
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,835
Man, it jacks up.

486
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,675
You drop down into the pit.
It's 25 feet straight down...

487
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,038
...and your balls, man,
your balls are about this big.

488
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,714
And the whole thing's fuckin' roaring.

489
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,916
Pushing you forward,
like you're on a freight train or something.

490
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,630
Yeah, and if you lose it,
the fish'll be picking you out of the coral.

491
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,519
Big-wave riding's
for macho assholes with a death wish.

492
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,758
No, it's not. It's the ultimate rush.

493
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,434
There's nothing that comes close to it.

494
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,869
Not even sex.

495
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,958
Maybe that's cos
you're not doing it right, Roach.

496
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,311
Just paddling out
in a big surf is total commitment.

497
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,951
You can’t just call time-out
if you don't like the way things are going.

498
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,512
So, what's biggest? Waimea?

499
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,919
- Ridden?
- Yeah.

500
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,830
McCaha.

501
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,876
Dana Point.

502
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,235
Bells Beach, Australia.

503
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,596
No way Bells is bigger than Waimea, bro.

504
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,193
It will be next year.

505
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,192
Bodhi believes the 50-year storm
is coming next year.

506
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,675
50-year storm. What's that?

507
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,869
That's kind of a legend.

508
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,315
No, it's real. It's absolutely real.

509
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,638
Everything moves in cycles...

510
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,350
...so twice a century the ocean
let's us know just how small we really are.

511
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,637
A storm comes out of Antarctica,
tearing up the Pacific...

512
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,838
...and it sends
a huge swell north 2,000 miles.

513
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,910
And when it hits Bells Beach it'll turn into
the biggest surf this planet has ever seen.

514
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,149
And I will be there.

515
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,832
So will I.

516
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,195
If you want the ultimate,
you gotta be willing to pay the ultimate price.

517
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,669
It's not tragic to die doing what you love.

518
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,193
It's how I want to go.

519
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,793
I ain't gonna live to see 30!

520
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,069
There's too much testosterone here!

521
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,195
<i>Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies.</i>

522
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,796
Hope you're not buying into this banzai
bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies!

523
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,112
What are you talking about?

524
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,110
You've got
that kamikaze look, Johnny. I've seen it.

525
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,672
Bodhi can smell it a mile away.

526
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,197
He'll take you to the edge.

527
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,909
Past it.

528
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,359
- Hey, Bodhi.
- Johnny has his own demons. Don't you?

529
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,513
What's going on?

530
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,428
Here. A stealth mission. You up for it?

531
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,831
<i>- Let's do it!
- Let's go!</i>

532
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,710
I can barely do this in broad daylight!

533
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,712
Come on. At least
nobody's gonna see how bad you are.

534
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,309
<i>- I don't think he's ready for this.
- He'll be fine.</i>

535
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,915
Shit!

536
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,798
Shit! Shit!

537
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,869
Fuck!

538
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,430
<i>I gotta be fuckin' crazy!</i>

539
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,953
But are you crazy enough?

540
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,032
Yaaaaaa-hoooooo!

541
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,916
Whooooo-hooooo!

542
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,036
Can't see shit out here. I'm gonna die.

543
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,793
Feel what the wave is doing,
then accept its energy.

544
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,836
Get in sync, then charge with it.

545
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,958
- You don't need to see.
- Yeah. Vision is overrated

546
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,436
OK, Johnny, this one's got your number on it.
Let's jam! Now paddle!

547
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,071
Shit! I'm gonna die now.
I'm gonna fuckin' die now.

548
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,718
Fuck!

549
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,158
Whoo! You're surfing, man!

550
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,918
Whaaaaaaaah!

551
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,190
I'm fuckin' surfin'!

552
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,991
Yeah!

553
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,555
Check it out!

554
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,870
Is this not the best feeling on earth?

555
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,439
Yeah!

556
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,919
Whoo!

557
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,351
Good break, Johnny.

558
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,029
All right!

559
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,878
Yeah.

560
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,472
- Looks like we lost somebody!
- Yeah, leave the fire for them.

561
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,116
<i>You wanna get something to eat?</i>

562
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,191
- I'm dying.
- I'm starving.

563
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,909
<i>Where's my clothes?
You seen my clothes?</i>

564
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,509
Had enough?

565
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,954
Yeah.

566
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,355
I just wanna sit out here for a minute.

567
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,991
Look at you.

568
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,959
What?

569
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,751
Usually you have this intense sort of
scowl of concentration on your face...

570
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,152
...like you're doing all this
for a school project or something.

571
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,232
Or like you've got something driving you.

572
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,469
Look - it's gone.

573
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,034
If I didn't know better...

574
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,998
...I'd say you looked almost happy.

575
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,674
I can't describe what I'm feeling.

576
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,959
You don't have to.

577
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,279
Goose bumps.

578
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,672
Yeah, it's cold.

579
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,749
Come here.

580
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,599
Holy shit!

581
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,592
<i>- What?
- Shit!</i>

582
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,191
I'm really late.

583
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,190
I'm really late!

584
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,510
Holy shit!

585
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,319
Shit! Oh, SHIT!

586
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,191
I'm really late.

587
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,639
You guys need any help?

588
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,076
I can't believe you're late
to your own raid! What a flake!

589
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,549
Has that worthless
punk partner of mine shown up?

590
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,269
- Right here.
- Good of you to show up, hotshot

591
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,078
Ow! You're gonna tear my skin!

592
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,191
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.
Where d'you want me?

593
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,269
Here's how it is.

594
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,638
Babbit and Alvarez are gonna go in the
back door. Cullen's gonna back me up.

595
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,948
<i>I want you at the side window.</i>

596
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,715
<i>You're strictly back-up. I don't wanna
burn your cover. You got that?</i>

597
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,676
<i>- Got it.
- Good.</i>

598
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,877
Now take your position. It's show time.

599
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,795
<i>Go.</i>

600
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,869
Asshole!

601
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,318
<i>Scooby? Come on, Scooby.</i>

602
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,031
<i>Scooby, where are you?</i>

603
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,269
- Seen a dog?
- No, man.

604
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,998
No dog? Scooby, come on.

605
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,160
Here, Scooby? Scooby?

606
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,196
What the fu...?

607
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,238
Get your gun.
There's someone at the front door! Now!

608
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,876
Yeah, what?

609
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,034
Oh... hi! Oh! Have you seen my dog?
It's a cockapoo-like thing.

610
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,473
I don't know anything about your dog.

611
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,231
Wait!

612
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,555
Cullen, this is Utah. Get Angelo out.
They're pulling out a fuckin' arsenal.

613
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,596
Utah, repeat, say again.

614
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,111
Cullen, you copy?

615
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,594
Cullen? Alvarez?

616
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,952
Don't let him pull his badge.

617
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,477
Fuck! I can't hear jack shit
over the lawnmower. Christ!

618
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,639
Something's going down, man.
This ain't right.

619
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,029
Chill the fuck out, man. It's nothing.

620
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,669
Will you shut the fuck up!
Check the windows, bro, do it!

621
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,560
<i>... and the little bastard ran off.</i>

622
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,117
<i>- I know nothing about a fuckin' dog!
- Hide the shit!</i>

623
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,431
- You sure it's not in the back yard?
- I ain't got time for this!

624
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,954
There's two guys out the back!
Duck down.

625
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,473
Oh, shit! Shit! We're fucked!

626
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,518
That fuck comes through the door,
I'm gonna pump him up, man.

627
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,353
- You sure he's not in the back?
- He ain't back here.

628
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,557
- Anybody else around who's seen him?
- Get the fuck outta my face!

629
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,390
FBI, gorgeous!

630
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,952
FBI, DROP IT!

631
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:37,876
Fuck you!

632
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,875
Fuckin' pigs!

633
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,755
No, wait! Hey...

634
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,231
Get off... motherfucker!

635
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,036
Shut up!

636
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,078
- You motherfuckers!
- Shut up, I said!

637
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,639
Dumb motherfuckers!

638
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,509
I'm coming out right now!
Back up! Back up!

639
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,794
Let me go! Let me go!

640
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,991
Bastard!

641
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,752
- Babbit?
- You fuckers!

642
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,835
Speak into the microphone, squid brain!

643
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,189
<i>Fuck!</i>

644
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,714
- Gimme your hand.
- Fuck you!

645
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,074
Gimme your other hand.

646
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,559
There you go. You OK?

647
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,998
Fuck!

648
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,438
Oooh! God!

649
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,115
No! Ow!

650
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,112
<i>Don't touch it!</i>

651
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,758
It's been paper targets up until today, huh?

652
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,910
It's no different, Johnny.
Just a little more to clean up.

653
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,591
You did all right today.

654
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,199
You did real good.

655
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,510
Goddamn son of a bitch!

656
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,354
You're real cowboys, right!
Batman and Robin!

657
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,752
You know what this is, huh?

658
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,831
Know what this is, punk?

659
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,553
It's two kees, uncut, crystal meth.

660
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,716
Oh, shit!

661
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,951
<i>Special Agent Utah,
I'd like you to meet Agent Dietz.</i>

662
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,396
Works for the DEA.
He was working deep cover until...

663
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,914
You think I like this hair, man? Huh?

664
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,195
You think I like these clothes?

665
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,396
My wife wants me to stay at Ramada.

666
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,519
I've been working on these fuckers
for three months! THREE MONTHS!

667
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,439
I finally got 'em to play Wheel Of Fortune
with me so I can find out their supplier...

668
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,557
...and you fuckin' cowboys show up.
- Nice tattoo, Dietz.

669
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,153
You like that, Pappas? Fuck you.

670
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,312
He has a record of your suspects'
movements over the last three months.

671
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,235
All I wanna know, smart guy, is
how did they rob a bank on August 2nd...

672
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,630
...when they were
in Fort fuckin' Lauderdale August 2nd?

673
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,917
- Why don't you figure that out?
- It's not an easy thing to do, is it, Utah?

674
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,149
You fuckin' jerks!

675
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,429
Aw, shit!

676
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,189
Shit!

677
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,592
Hey! Five foot wall's at Zero's. Let's go.

678
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,150
Hey, Tyler.

679
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,438
Hey, Bodhi!

680
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,755
So, let's go!

681
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,432
Time's a-wasting.

682
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,918
- Now!
- He does this.

683
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,590
You all right?
You look like you saw a ghost.

684
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,677
<i>Forget about it, kid. They're ghosts.</i>

685
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,075
I gotta go.

686
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,036
You gotta what?

687
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,157
I forgot all about a meeting
I have this morning.

688
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,556
I gotta jam. Sorry. Really.
I'll call you later.

689
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,910
So, I started trailing him.

690
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,353
The Zen surf master?

691
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,000
Bodhi, yeah. I'm on him all day, right?

692
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,437
He goes to Tower Records, buys some
CDs, has lunch at Patrick's Roadhouse...

693
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,557
...he goes into the Assured Trust
Savings and Loan.

694
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,675
Did he rob it?

695
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,833
Cute! He's inside 20 minutes.
The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.

696
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,911
They were scoping it out, right?

697
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,673
Well, they were scoping it out
or cashing a cheque.

698
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,276
Wait. Then they go back home
and they box up all their shit.

699
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,475
See, summer's over.

700
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,599
They load it in Bodhi's truck
and they take it to a public storage unit.

701
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,514
I lost them after that, but the house
is empty. They're definitely outta here.

702
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,669
Goddamn it! Why didn't you call me?
They're probably halfway to Maui.

703
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,311
Uh-uh, no. They've got to pick up
some traveling money first.

704
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,315
Assured Trust tomorrow, next day latest.
I definitely got a feeling on this.

705
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,198
Last time you had a feeling,
I had to kill a guy.

706
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,589
I hate that. It looks bad on my report.

707
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:36,590
Angelo, I'm right this time.
We can still win this one.

708
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,357
OK.

709
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,913
Tomorrow morning, first thing,
we'll be at the bank like stink on shit.

710
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,148
<i>This Calvin and Hobbes is funny.</i>

711
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,639
Oranges, sir?

712
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,790
<i>- You want some oranges?
- No.</i>

713
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,190
No. We got a lot. No, thanks. Good luck.

714
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,111
God!

715
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,193
<i>... for his turkey cemetery?!</i>

716
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,191
It's time for lunch.

717
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,797
Angelo, it's 10.30!

718
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,795
Around that corner is a sandwich shop.
They sell meatball sandwiches.

719
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,678
Best I've ever tasted.
Would you go get me two?

720
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,956
Come on, partner. Two.

721
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,989
Thank you.

722
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,350
Utah? Get me two.

723
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,355
Hi. How ya doing?

724
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,355
Hi. Two meatball sandwiches, a tuna
on wheat and two lemonades, please.

725
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,798
<i>OK, that's two meatballs,
one tuna on wheat...</i>

726
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,270
<i>... two lemonades. That's $7.84.</i>

727
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,517
<i>- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.</i>

728
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,551
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

729
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,669
God, you scared me!

730
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,513
Here.
Yours is the one that looks like a road kill.

731
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,510
A road kill?

732
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,556
- Enjoy.
- Thank you very much.

733
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,870
- Here's your lemonade.
- Thanks.

734
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,232
Did you see that Lincoln pull up?

735
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,677
I'm so hungry I could eat the ass
off a dead rhino. I should've asked for three.

736
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,715
What Lincoln?

737
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,391
Goddamn!

738
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,993
FBI! Freeze!

739
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,593
I got him! I got him!

740
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,829
No!

741
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,194
Freeze!

742
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:42,837
Fuck!

743
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,918
Get in! Get in!

744
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,911
- Jesus Christ!
- Go! Go!

745
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,191
Go!

746
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,111
Gimme a fuckin' break! I am going!

747
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,277
- I don't see 'em! Where'd they go?
- I don't fuckin' believe this!

748
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,793
We're losing 'em!

749
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,791
- You're losing 'em!
- I'm not!

750
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,709
Over to the right!

751
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,794
- It's coming up.
- Punch it! Punch it! Punch it!

752
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,990
- Where is he, Dick?
- He's still behind us.

753
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,914
<i>Hang on, you guys.</i>

754
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,989
This car's a piece of shit.

755
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,396
Oh, shit!

756
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,636
They're on the left!

757
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,311
- I think we lost 'em. I can't see 'em.
- Tell me where he is.

758
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,712
Oh, fuck. Watch out!

759
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,910
- We got you!
- You ain't got shit!

760
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,075
Damn it! Come on, come on!

761
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,194
OK, guys, emergency sanitation.

762
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,919
Back up, buddy! Try it, man. Just try it.

763
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,958
What about the old Chevy?

764
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,589
- This guy down here.
- I got him. I got the gun.

765
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,797
- Get away from the car! Move it!
- Get in.

766
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:45,835
Wait, wait, wait.

767
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,919
Don't do it, man. Don't be stupid. Run!

768
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,277
Why's he taking so long?

769
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,557
Come on!

770
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,640
We gotta go now! What's his problem?

771
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:14,711
Come on!

772
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,075
- Let's go!
- Oh! Shit!

773
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,358
Fuck!

774
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,473
Look out!

775
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,749
Hey!

776
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,671
GET THE FUCK OUT OF THIS HOUSE!

777
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,718
WHAT D'YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

778
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,791
HEY! HEY! HEY!

779
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,117
Say again, 41.

780
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,634
Roger that.
Cal. Plate - 562, Sam, Ida, X-ray. Base out.

781
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,154
Nothing?

782
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,878
Nothing.

783
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,313
Johnny,
I wanna see you in my office right now.

784
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,237
Unit 23. See the manager, 4650 Wilshire.

785
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,593
I want you to know something.
When you shoot, you don't miss.

786
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,439
I missed.

787
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,318
No. I believe you're either scared...

788
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,871
...or you're getting too goddamn close
to this surfing guru buddy of yours.

789
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,797
I don't believe you're scared.

790
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:31,191
Hey, go home and get some rest.
You look like hammered shit.

791
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,590
If I get anything
that resembles your boy, I'll beep you.

792
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,309
Now go home.

793
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,152
<i>Damn!</i>

794
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,231
<i>What's the other guy look like?</i>

795
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,792
Never saw him. It was a basic hit-and-run.

796
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,358
You look like you got in a train wreck.

797
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,954
Stupid jerk just kept driving?

798
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,076
Ouch! Baby, I'm sorry.

799
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:06,196
Johnny, what is it with you?
You've got that look again.

800
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:11,919
As if you're about
to tell me something and then you don't.

801
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,519
Or you can't.

802
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,592
There's something I want to tell you.

803
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,349
It's important. It could
really affect things between you and me.

804
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,915
Man!

805
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,872
This is harder than I thought.

806
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,073
God, men are so bad at this.

807
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,872
Shhh. Some other time.

808
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,237
- You act like nothing happened!
- Relax, Nathanial.

809
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,916
Don't tell me to relax, Bodhi!
He's a fucking federal agent!

810
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,036
I should've
shot him when I had the chance.

811
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,111
I'll deal with that fuckin' cop.

812
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,633
No, Rosie.

813
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,277
We have hit 30 banks in three years
and they haven't been able to touch us.

814
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,635
All this does is up the stakes of the game.

815
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:26,840
Fuck the stakes, Bodhi! The only person
this is a game to is you. This is real!

816
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,637
This is serious shit and I am scared. OK?

817
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,554
So I say we get
the fuck outta here now, tonight, OK?

818
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,119
You run, you die.

819
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,953
<i>Come on, think about it.</i>

820
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,358
This was never about money for us.
It was about us against the system.

821
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:49,116
That system that kills the human spirit.
We stand for something.

822
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:53,716
To those dead souls inching along
the freeways in their metal coffins...

823
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,837
...we show them
that the human spirit is still alive.

824
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,233
So, you trust me?

825
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,076
OK.

826
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:16,031
Then don't worry about this guy.
I know exactly what to do with him.

827
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,308
A lawyer!

828
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,953
You lied to me!

829
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,395
Tyler, put the gun down.

830
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,592
I bet you lied about everything.

831
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,711
I bet you lied about your parents!

832
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,199
You just tell me the truth, Johnny.

833
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:52,359
Did your parents die in a car accident?

834
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,756
DID THEY?!

835
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,392
They live in Columbus, Ohio.

836
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,836
I work Bank Robbery. The guys I'm after
are surfers. I needed you at first...

837
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,672
...but after that...
- Fuck you!

838
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,151
Don't you have a soul?

839
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,994
Goddamn you to hell!

840
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,069
Tyler...

841
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,239
TYLER, WAIT!

842
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,112
TYLER!

843
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,559
<i>- Leave a message.
- Tyler, look, I fucked up. OK?</i>

844
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,198
I know I fucked up.

845
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,949
I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't.

846
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,589
I was afraid you'd leave.
Good guess, huh?

847
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,229
Fuck!
Why can't I ever say what I really mean?

848
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,313
<i>I lied to you.
I'm an asshole, but I need you, Tyler.</i>

849
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,279
<i>I want you to know I've never known
anyone like you before in my life...</i>

850
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,396
<i>... and I hope you change your mind.</i>

851
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,468
Tyler, wait. I'm coming.

852
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,997
Howdy, bro.

853
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,632
So, come on, we're rollin'.

854
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,154
What's going on, Bodhi?

855
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,071
What happened?
Cut yourself shaving?

856
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,515
I don't think I wanna surf right now.

857
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,991
Surf? No, this is really different, Johnny,
you are gonna love it.

858
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,390
So, we gotta get your stuff
and get outta here.

859
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,711
<i>OK. Uh, socks...</i>

860
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,998
...shirt.

861
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,752
Uh... boots. Here we go.

862
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,079
OK, put the stuff on in the truck.
We gotta go. Life is short.

863
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,674
You are gonna love this!

864
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,469
Yo!

865
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,711
All right, let's unload.

866
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:03,355
- Take this, too.
- Thank you, sir. There you go.

867
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,839
Ever done this before?

868
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,036
No, but I've seen it on TV.

869
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,838
It's 100% pure adrenaline.

870
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,038
Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it.
All you gotta do is jump.

871
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,476
I'm sure it's a blast,
but I screwed my knee up yesterday.

872
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,270
Yeah, I noticed you limping, but don't
worry cos we're not gonna land on land.

873
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,511
Well, fine then. I feel so much better

874
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,672
OK, let's fly.

875
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,789
Three minutes.

876
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,556
This is a ceremony we always do at the end
of the summer. One last speed star.

877
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:47,349
By the way, you might wanna
pull that little orange thing sometime.

878
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,000
The life you save may be your own.

879
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,550
So, uh... who packed my chute?

880
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,676
I did. Why? You don't trust me?

881
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,994
You gotta earn trust.

882
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,993
OK, we'll earn it together. Here, take mine.

883
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,276
Hey, Johnny, that's not a good idea.

884
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:10,148
Bodhi's packs are pretty shitty.
They only open about half the time.

885
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:10,752
Less!

886
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,829
Bullshit.

887
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,595
Why don't you take
young Grommet's? How'd that be?

888
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:19,673
Nah, you don't want this one, man.
This one's set for a neck-breaker.

889
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:23,548
You'd probably
be better off with something like this.

890
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,198
Are we gonna jump or jerk off?

891
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,316
That's my man!

892
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,671
Let's do it!

893
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:38,111
You're about to jump out of a perfectly
good aeroplane. How you feel about that?

894
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,718
Shit! Whoa, shit!

895
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,589
Whoa-ho-ho!

896
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,471
Sex with the gods!

897
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,711
You can't beat this!

898
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,156
This is fucking beautiful!

899
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,791
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

900
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,989
Ha-ha!

901
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,631
Whew!

902
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,915
Whoa! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

903
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,309
Hah!

904
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,990
Come on, Johnny.

905
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,989
That's it, Johnny. Go for it.

906
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,395
Come on, Johnny!

907
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,793
You can do it. Come on!

908
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,471
Use your arms. Fly like an eagle, baby.

909
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,709
Whoo!

910
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,671
Keep coming.

911
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,274
All right!

912
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,874
- Johnny, you did it.
- You're a speed star.

913
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,555
We're going like a bat out o' hell.

914
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,551
Whoo!

915
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,873
How do you like it, Johnny?

916
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,589
Amazing.

917
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,836
Fucking amazing!

918
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:38,717
This is so beautiful.
I love this ground-rush shit.

919
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,596
OK. Break!

920
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,839
Great, isn't it?

921
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,916
You're doing good.

922
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,474
A thousand feet, pull.

923
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:10,677
After you, Alphonse. I insist.

924
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,076
Pull the ripcord now.

925
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,275
You first.

926
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,475
OK!

927
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,595
Son of a bitch!

928
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,191
Jesus Christ.

929
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,191
I gotta be losing it.

930
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,878
It's the closest you'll ever get to God.

931
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:26,516
It's like the palm of your hand, man.
Zoom! Coming right at you.

932
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,795
- Unbelievable.
- Totally indescribable.

933
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,475
<i>- We did pull pretty low.
- You'll never be the same again.</i>

934
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,313
- Didn't I tell you Johnny'd be just fine?
- Yeah. Damn perf!

935
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,312
Johnny, just drop your chute right there.

936
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,550
Pack off your shoulders.

937
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,598
- Step back out of it.
- I'll pack that for you, Bodhi.

938
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,954
OK. Thanks.

939
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,430
Johnny, come here.
There's something you need to see.

940
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,472
Hop in.

941
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,912
OK.

942
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,194
What's this?

943
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,153
This is an insurance policy.

944
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:10,914
<i>It will sting a bit,
but it's for your own growth. Press play.</i>

945
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,911
Fuck you!

946
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,316
<i>FUCK YOU!</i>

947
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,910
She is a wild one,
isn't she, Special Agent Utah?

948
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,429
You're a fuckin' dead man!

949
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,239
Hold it, man. Think it through, man.

950
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,279
I'm the only one that knows where she is.
I'm the only one...

951
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,316
...so let me talk. Let me talk.

952
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,110
Talk.

953
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,789
She'll be fine. Rosie won't do anything...

954
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:17,668
...as long as I meet him
at a certain place and time in six hours.

955
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,389
You call him right now
and tell him to let her go!

956
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,711
Sorry, I can't do it, bro.
They're on the road...

957
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,112
...and where they're going,
there are no phones, so you are outta luck.

958
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,839
Oh, man.

959
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,915
I hate this, Johnny. I really do.

960
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,195
I hate violence.

961
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,272
That's why I need Rosie.
I could never do that.

962
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,352
I could never hold a knife to Tyler's throat.
She was my woman.

963
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,431
We shared time.

964
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,314
But Rosie is a... mechanism, you know?

965
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,279
Once you set him in motion,
he will not stop.

966
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,718
He's, like, got this gift of blankness.

967
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:07,990
But when three o'clock comes
he will gut her like a pig...

968
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,031
...and try not to get any on his shoes.

969
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,395
There's nothing
I can do about it unless I get there.

970
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,316
So I guess that makes us partners...

971
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,910
...because we both have the same goal:
To get me where I need to go, right?

972
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,239
We're wasting time.

973
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:31,395
That's what I love about you, Johnny.
You are just as sharp as a razor.

974
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,075
Murphy, take the plane
down to Santa Monica, top up the tanks.

975
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,357
- OK, you guys, it's party time. Move it!
- Right. We're on it.

976
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:56,313
All I'm asking for
is 90 seconds of your life, Johnny.

977
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,238
You see? It's basic dog psychology.

978
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,510
If you scare them and get them
peeing down their leg, they submit.

979
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:11,113
Yet if you project weakness, you draw
aggression. That's how people get hurt.

980
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:15,828
You see, fear causes hesitation...

981
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,149
...and hesitation
will cause your worst fears to come true.

982
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:24,791
So it's simple.
You project strength to avoid conflict.

983
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,314
Peace through superior firepower.

984
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,029
Oh...

985
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,239
There. Can't have you walking through
those doors with your dick in your hand.

986
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,628
I can't do this.

987
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:44,915
Sure you can.

988
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,073
Who knows?
You might like it. It's a killer rush.

989
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,833
Bodhi,
this is your fuckin' wake-up call, man!

990
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,559
I am an FBI agent!

991
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,871
I know, man. Isn't it wild?

992
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,951
But that's what makes it great, Johnny.

993
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,918
We can exist on a different plane,
we can make our own rules.

994
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,958
Why be a servant to the law
when you can be its master?

995
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:04,790
Fuckin' A!

996
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,275
I love this fuckin' job.

997
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,432
OK, 90 seconds, door to door.

998
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,835
It's a small price to pay
for someone who loves you.

999
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,677
She does, you know?

1000
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:21,072
It's not her style to fall so hard.
I don't think she did with me.

1001
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,278
OK, Mr Carter.

1002
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,232
LBJ.

1003
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:32,869
Mr Nixon.

1004
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:46,392
Well, sorry, Johnny.
Looks like you don't get to be president!

1005
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,468
I'm ready.

1006
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,917
Rock and roll!

1007
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,629
Everybody freeze!

1008
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,560
- OK. On the floor now!
- On the floor right now! Do it.

1009
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,279
Hold it! Where you going?

1010
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,351
Everybody down! Let's go!

1011
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,353
<i>On the floor, asshole!</i>

1012
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,194
I'll blow out your fuckin' kneecaps,
then you'll be on the floor.

1013
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,032
A kick in the ass, ain't it, man?

1014
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,634
Hey, look. You're on TV. Smile.

1015
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,949
Could be a little hard to play FBI now, huh?

1016
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,429
Can we just get the goddamned money
and get out of here!

1017
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,318
Nobody move. Heads down, eyes down.

1018
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:50,109
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention, please?

1019
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:54,671
We are the Ex-Presidents and, as you can
see, we are, in fact, robbing your bank.

1020
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,435
So with a little co-operation
I won't have to blow your heads off.

1021
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,592
So I need just a couple of minutes
of your lives and we're gone.

1022
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,512
Dick, go to the vault.

1023
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:12,632
Uh... you, Miss Jennings, would you be a
dear and open the gate for my associate?

1024
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,073
Mr Duggan's got the keys.

1025
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:16,276
We never go to the vault!

1026
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,349
Just do it!

1027
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,671
Lyndon, go with them.
Get in the vault, man. Go! Go!

1028
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,917
Who's Mr fuckin' Duggan?!

1029
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,754
Mr Duggan, do you wanna
open the vault or do you want me to do it?

1030
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,478
Do whatever they want, Teri.

1031
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,831
Take the fucking keys! Take 'em!

1032
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,669
Move it!

1033
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,875
Open the damned door!

1034
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,350
I'll fuckin' blow
your fuckin' head off! Move it!

1035
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,237
Come on! Come on!

1036
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:49,909
Get outta the way!

1037
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,399
OK. All right.

1038
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,833
Go for the big bag.

1039
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,876
What we doin' in a fuckin' vault?!

1040
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,148
This is a bad idea.

1041
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,034
<i>On the ground. Don't look at me!</i>

1042
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:06,033
You're blowing it, man. You're breaking
your own rules and pulling too much time.

1043
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,235
Jimmy, how we doing?

1044
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,032
65. What's happening?

1045
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,237
Don't worry, man, it's fine. It's great.

1046
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,912
Fuck! Fuck!

1047
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,553
Hurry up!

1048
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:52,631
Let's go, we gotta go!

1049
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,919
Fuckin' move!

1050
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,953
Federal agent. Undercover!

1051
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,790
Nobody fuckin' move!

1052
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,108
You OK? Hang on, little bro.

1053
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:01,390
Come on,
we are outta here. We are outta here.

1054
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,513
Hang on, little brother. Just hang on, man.

1055
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,470
No, man. No!

1056
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,876
Are you outta your fuckin' mind?

1057
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:36,110
What's the matter with you?! Is that what
you want? Did you get what you wanted?

1058
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,395
You can't take him with. LET'S GO!

1059
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:03,675
Goddamn it, who's in charge of this
camera crew? This is a crime-scene area!

1060
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,273
Get 'em the fuck outta here!

1061
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,316
You have the right to remain silent.

1062
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,597
Anything you say, can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

1063
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:14,150
If you so desire, an attorney
will be provided for you, free of cost.

1064
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:17,676
Do you understand
these rights I've just given you, Utah?

1065
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,150
D'you understand! Understand
the rights I've just read you, Utah?!

1066
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:24,835
He understands his goddamned rights!
Jesus Christ, kid, are you OK?

1067
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,717
Stand up. Get these cuffs off him.

1068
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,918
Leave 'em on! Your partner's
an accessory to murder, you understand?

1069
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,514
There are three dead people.
One's a police officer.

1070
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,592
Let me show you something, pal.
How does that sit in your stomach?

1071
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:40,275
Take your hands off me right now.

1072
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,588
Come on.

1073
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,830
Listen, look at me. Look at me!

1074
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:47,708
Don't send him in
with the black and whites, let me ride him in.

1075
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,518
Yeah, sure, Angelo, why not?

1076
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,034
That's why
I put you two together to begin with.

1077
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:54,793
You deserve each other.
You're just as bad as he is...

1078
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,872
...only you're a little fatter,
slower and more pathetic.

1079
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,359
It's like the blind leading the blind.

1080
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:05,436
Harp, I was in this Bureau when you were
still popping zits on your funny face...

1081
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:09,429
...and jackin' off to the lingerie section
of the Sears catalogue!

1082
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,748
Is that right, Pappas?

1083
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:15,755
Yes, that's right, and there's one thing
I've learnt that you still haven't got.

1084
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,832
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you astonish me, shit face?

1085
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:25,512
Respect for my elders, plain and simple.

1086
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,758
<i>- Come on, kid, let's go.
- Holy shit.</i>

1087
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,718
I know where they're going.

1088
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:41,197
I figured you did.

1089
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,989
Santa Monica airport. Fast!
But we've got one minor problem.

1090
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:46,751
What?

1091
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:49,912
We can't arrest them or shoot them.

1092
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:51,789
What?!

1093
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,752
Did you set the altimeter?

1094
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,319
- One thousand.
- What?

1095
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,958
One thousand.

1096
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,428
Check the rigging, OK?

1097
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,635
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1098
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,311
Fuckin' FBI.

1099
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:34,911
I'm not armed.

1100
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,750
But you're not alone.

1101
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:42,955
Good guess.

1102
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:49,237
There's a gun on you right now.

1103
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,514
Where's Roach?

1104
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,030
He's around somewhere.

1105
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,590
Listen, Johnny, we are in kind of a hurry.
What do you need?

1106
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:03,796
You gotta tell me where she is.

1107
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,633
And let my policy expire? Good idea.

1108
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,474
Look, Bodhi, people are dead.
The ride is over.

1109
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:13,832
Oh, no, no. I say when it's over.

1110
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:18,991
The guy you killed was an off-duty cop.
They'll nail you wherever you land.

1111
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:22,470
There's a new thing called radar.
Maybe you've heard of it.

1112
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,073
<i>What is your...</i>

1113
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,752
Nathanial, get in there.

1114
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:28,995
<i>Get back in the cockpit. Move!</i>

1115
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,833
I know you, man.

1116
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,229
When they fall on you,
you won't back down.

1117
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,629
They'll have to burn your ass to the ground!

1118
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,199
Uh-huh. And shit happens.

1119
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:47,274
Look, you got a death wish, fine,
but don't take Tyler with you.

1120
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,157
I'm begging you.

1121
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,279
Tell me where she is, then I walk away.

1122
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,149
You walk away?

1123
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:55,468
I walk away.

1124
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,791
That is beautiful, Johnny.

1125
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,559
ANGELO, DON'T FIRE!

1126
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,516
THEY'LL KILL HER. NO!

1127
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,154
Get out of the way, kid! Goddamn it!

1128
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,030
Damn.

1129
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,551
NOOOOO!

1130
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,951
Jesus Christ!

1131
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,117
- Angelo.
- I don't have much...

1132
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,999
- Come on, man, just hang on.
- I really fucked up.

1133
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,389
Just hang on. You'll be all right.

1134
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,831
I'm not flying you guys to San Felipe.

1135
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:27,710
- Get in the plane. Start those engines.
- Good Tell him where we're going.

1136
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:31,517
Let's go, man.

1137
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:36,636
We are gonna ride this all the way, Johnny,
you and me. So let's go.

1138
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,552
Get the fuck up! Tyler's waiting.

1139
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,119
Start the engines now!

1140
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:48,717
Go!

1141
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,353
GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!

1142
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:34,512
Rosie? Yo, Rosie, this is Air Force One.
Do you read me? Do you read me? Over.

1143
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,592
Look, we've been
over Mexico for the last half-hour.

1144
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,272
Can I quit mowing the lawn here?

1145
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,193
Getting more bushes
in the wheels than I usually like.

1146
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:46,114
Shut your mouth and take it
to 4,000 feet on this heading, all right?

1147
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:51,718
I don't think that's such a good idea, man.
We'll pop up on their screens.

1148
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:56,396
Doesn't matter, we're almost there.
Just gotta get you to a safe jump altitude.

1149
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,471
Let's get your rig on.

1150
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,478
Hey, man, I'm cold. Really cold.

1151
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,358
I'll get your jacket.
Here's your jacket. Easy.

1152
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,953
Oh, fuck!

1153
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,393
I know, I know, I know.

1154
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,914
Easy. Easy. One arm at a time.

1155
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,991
I can't get it, I can't get it.

1156
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,675
No, man! No, no, no!

1157
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,872
Johnny, throw me that money bag.

1158
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,389
NOW!

1159
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:36,879
You're cold because all the blood
is running out of your body, Roach.

1160
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,473
You're going to be dead soon.

1161
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,913
I hope it was worth it.

1162
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,918
Don't listen to him, he's just scared.

1163
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:47,029
Just keep thinking about
all those señoritas and margaritas...

1164
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,839
...that are
gonna nurse you back to health, OK?

1165
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,195
What the fuck are you looking at?

1166
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,909
There you go.

1167
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:15,037
Rosie! Rosie, this is Air Force One.
Do you copy? Do you copy? Over.

1168
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,475
<i>Copy. We have a visual on you.</i>

1169
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:18,993
Tell him to release Tyler.

1170
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,993
Do it! Do it now!

1171
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,435
You won, you got what you wanted.

1172
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,796
What if your chute fails?
Cancel the order.

1173
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,759
She's served her purpose.

1174
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,478
Do it, man. You owe me that much.

1175
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,473
- OK, you ready?
- Yeah.

1176
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,231
On three.

1177
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,550
One, two... three.

1178
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:48,919
Easy. Come on, a little more.

1179
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,273
- Get your chute clear. OK?
- OK.

1180
01:39:57,080 --> 01:40:00,231
I'll see you on the ground, all right?

1181
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,358
I'll see you in hell, Johnny.

1182
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,709
Oh!

1183
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,633
I know it's hard for you. You want me
so bad it's like acid in your mouth...

1184
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,880
...but not this time.

1185
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,996
Adios, amigo.

1186
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,234
Fucker!

1187
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,233
God! Wha...?

1188
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,436
- Pull the chute, Bodhi.
- You are crazy.

1189
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:31,318
- Pull the fuckin' chute!
- Why don't you pull it?

1190
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,039
No games, Bodhi! Pull the cord now!

1191
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:36,395
Nah, you pull it.

1192
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,471
Go ahead, Johnny, pull it.

1193
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,039
You gotta drop the gun, right?

1194
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,793
If you use your other hand,
what you gonna hold on with?

1195
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:47,192
Pull it right now, or I blow
your fuckin' head off and pull it myself.

1196
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:50,795
- It's the only way it's gonna happen. Do it.
- Swear to God, I will.

1197
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,713
Do it, man, or you're gonna die, Johnny.

1198
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,668
Six seconds,
we're gonna be meat waffles.

1199
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,320
Five... four...

1200
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,915
- You're fuckin' crazy! PULL IT! PULL IT!
...three... two...

1201
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,714
...one...
- Shit!

1202
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,269
Shit!

1203
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:51,914
Jesus Christ, Bodhi.

1204
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:54,830
God.

1205
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,309
Damn, you are one radical son of a bitch.

1206
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,037
I'm outta here, Johnny.

1207
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,150
That knee again, huh?

1208
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:34,437
Too bad. Looks like
this time you won't be getting your man.

1209
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:38,673
This game we both lose.

1210
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,029
Let her go.

1211
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,597
Let her go!

1212
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,313
Johnny, I...

1213
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:30,437
Shh. Some other time.

1214
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,070
Come on, we're out of here.

1215
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:47,793
Yo, Johnny!

1216
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,317
I'll see you in the next life!

1217
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,237
I can't leave him. We gotta bury him.

1218
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:20,039
There's no time, man.

1219
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:46,754
<i>... the cyclone warning is for coastal
areas between Torquay and Cape Ottway.</i>

1220
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,910
<i>Experts are saying this could be one of
the worst storms in Australia's history.</i>

1221
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,195
<i>Heavy rains will continue into the night...</i>

1222

<i>... with destructive winds
reaching up to 150km per hour.</i>

1223

<i>The centre of the cyclone

<i>... at Bells Beach early tomorrow morning.</i>

1225

<i>Residents are advised
to prepare for evacuation.</i>

1226
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,309
<i>What d'you wanna do now?</i>

1227
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:31,478
I wanna get out of this wet. I'm freezing.

1228
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,116
Sorry, mate.

1229
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:39,553
Anybody been out there?

1230
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:42,029
No-one's been out and no-one's going out.

1231
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:45,874
You gotta be fucking crazy, man.
Death-on-a-stick out there, mate.

1232
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,271
Coming down, man.

1233
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,118
Lose something, bro?

1234
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:39,796
Special Agent Utah.
I knew I could count on you.

1235
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,754
I've been to every city in Mexico.

1236
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:47,871
Came across an unclaimed piece
of meat in Baja, turned out to be Rosie.

1237
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:51,157
Guess he picked
a knife fight with somebody better.

1238
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:56,748
Found a passport of yours in Sumatra,
missed you by about a week in Fiji.

1239
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:01,272
But I knew
you wouldn't miss a 50-year storm, Bodhi.

1240
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:02,954
Yeah.

1241
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:13,270
Too bad. You finally get your waves
and it's totally closed out.

1242
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,476
Just waiting for my set.

1243
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:20,235
You gotta go down.

1244
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:23,910
You crossed the line
and people trusted you and they died.

1245
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:26,749
Yeah, it went bad, went real bad.

1246
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:31,632
Life sure has a sick sense of humour,
doesn't it?

1247
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:37,154
- Still surfing?
- Every day.

1248
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:43,517
Come on, Bodhi. It's time to go.

1249
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,748
You know you gotta go back with me.

1250
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:52,194
Sorry, my friend.

1251
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:57,909
Come on!

1252
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,594
SHIT! NO!

1253
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:13,789
NO!

1254
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:17,597
I told them...

1255
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,997
...you'd go quietly.

1256
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,150
NO!

1257
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,995
You know
there's no way I can handle a cage, man.

1258
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:33,272
I don't care. You gotta go down.

1259
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:36,438
It's gotta be that way.

1260
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:57,596
OK, man. OK.

1261
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,319
I'm screwed.

1262
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:07,033
I'm gonna go to jail and I'll pay,
and Johnny Utah gets his guy. Right?

1263
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:09,953
Good for you. That's real good.

1264
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:12,635
You're gonna be a big hero now.

1265
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:16,473
But look at it, Johnny. Look at it!

1266
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:19,320
This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, man.

1267
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:24,394
Just let me go out there, let me get
one wave before you take me. One wave.

1268
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,910
Where am I gonna go, man?

1269
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:31,398
Cliffs on both side.
I'm not gonna paddle to New Zealand!

1270
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,796
My whole life
has been about this moment, Johnny.

1271
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,194
Come on, compadre.

1272
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:43,716
Come on.

1273
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:52,871
COME ON!

1274
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,911
Via con Dios!

1275
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:42,633
What the fuck, Utah?

1276
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:45,359
You let him go!

1277
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,072
No, I didn't.

1278
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,798
No way! The guy's nuts.

1279
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:11,790
We'll get him when he comes back in.

1280
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,391
He's not coming back.
