1
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:42,445
You know what I would love to do?

2
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:51,057
I would love to... fix that flat for you,
but I can't. I mean...

3
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:54,362
It's your only tux,
and you're late for your wedding.

4
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:57,460
How could I be late?
We've just met.

5
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:03,933
I'm a lot friendlier than he is.

6
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,105
That's what I'm afraid of.

7
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,710
Wow!

8
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:16,983
Kick in the butt, ain't it?

9
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:19,048
I never felt anything like it.

10
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,960
Ooh, who makes this?

11
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:26,897
Oh, this?
This is an experimental model.

12
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,893
Look at that.

13
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:39,608
- Oh, that's, uh, sheet lightning.
- I never saw lightning like that before.

14
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,079
And there are no clouds.
I can see the stars.

15
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:47,510
You know, that's about where they
set off the first atomic bomb.

16
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:51,182
No kidding.

17
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:54,591
And some people say there's
still a top secret project out there.

18
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,824
Something to do with
the deep space probe or a...

19
00:01:57,898 --> 00:02:00,765
- Control!
- What's happening, Gooshie?

20
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:05,134
He's leaping.
Ziggy said no, but Sam's leaping.

21
00:02:05,205 --> 00:02:08,834
- He can't leap. We're not ready.
- Tell Sam that!

22
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,312
- Put him on!
- I can't. He's in the accelerator.

23
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:25,687
Al-Al, what do I do?

24
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,989
Nothing. Any interference
could kill him.

25
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:30,052
I'll be there in two minutes.

26
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,724
Hang on, beautiful.

27
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,959
We did it.

28
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:19,164
Did what?

29
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,768
I can't remember.

30
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:26,437
I can't remember anything.

31
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:28,777
Who am I?

32
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:31,774
Where am I?

33
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:40,318
I'll put the coffee on, Tom.

34
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:43,328
Oh, boy.

35
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:45,387
I'm in big trouble here.

36
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:48,161
I don't even remember going to bed
with this woman, whoever she is.

37
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:52,136
And whoever she is,
she's certainly... pregnant.

38
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,674
Very pregnant.

39
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:57,733
Good morning.

40
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:07,712
What will I be you okay?

41
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:10,688
<i>The secretary of state
appeared to be acting as a go-between... </i>

42
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:14,124
<i>at the United Nations in an effort to
cool down the heightened tensions between... </i>

43
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:16,754
Tom, better hurry up.

44
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,697
Bird Dog's gonna be here to pick you up
in about 10 minutes.

45
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:22,064
Oh, honey, the P.X. was out
of your shaving cream,

46
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:24,467
so I got you some of that stuff, uh...

47
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:27,973
What do you call it? The one with
the cute little signs on the highway.

48
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:32,341
"Burma Shave?"
Oh, that's it.

49
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:35,677
Burma Shave.
I love those little signs.

50
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,652
What's taking you so long?
You gotta hurry up. Come on.

51
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,711
Get in there.

52
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:50,057
Oh, Tom. Sometimes...

53
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,128
It's a dream.

54
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,898
That's it. I'm dreaming.

55
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:01,907
All I have to do is flow with it,
and I'll wake up.

56
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,410
Shave.

57
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:08,379
The sooner you shave,
the sooner you'll wake up.

58
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,909
Oh, God.

59
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,446
It smells real.

60
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,992
It feels real.

61
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,221
What the hell is happening?

62
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:36,267
Tom?

63
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:39,971
Honey, what's wrong? Who
do you see in the mirror?

64
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:43,209
Oh, Tom, would you cut it out?
You nearly scared me into delivering.

65
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,444
Who do you see in the mirror?
You.

66
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,215
- Me?
- And me.

67
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,053
Oh.

68
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,252
Oh, I look awful.

69
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:57,125
Most women bloom
when they get pregnant. I shrivel.

70
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:59,131
Tom, I look like a prune.

71
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,827
My name's not Tom.

72
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:04,199
Honey, you're supposed to say,
"Peg, I love prunes. "

73
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,570
- What do you mean your name's not Tom?
- Daddy, Captain Birdell's on the phone.

74
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:15,580
- I'm a daddy.
- Tom, are you sick?

75
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,516
Oh, honey, you're not gonna fly
if you're sick, are you?

76
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:25,247
Fly?

77
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:30,189
Mikey, tell Captain Birdell that Daddy will
call him as soon as he gets out of the shower.

78
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:34,165
Roger. And get his number. You know
him. He never sleeps at the B.O.Q

79
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:38,160
555-2231.

80
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:40,832
Daddy's in the shower.
What's your number?

81
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:52,777
5-5-5

82
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:58,686
Tom, what are you up to?
I'm calling my office.

83
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:02,524
- But that's Block field 8-4-7.
- What the hell's wrong with the phone?

84
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:04,961
You're dialing too many numbers.

85
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:08,228
Too many? Maybe not enough.
What's the area code?

86
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:12,362
Area code? You never tell us
codes, Dad. That's secret stuff.

87
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:14,463
Secret? What the hell
is secret about an area code?

88
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:18,409
If you're testing one of your gags on us,
I don't have time for it and neither do you.

89
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:20,878
<i>That's the morning report on KHOl. </i>

90
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,177
<i>Stay tuned for all the denizens
of Doodyville... </i>

91
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:26,013
<i>with Buffalo Bob and Howdy Doody. </i>

92
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:30,384
<i>Well, Howdy Doody, kids. </i>

93
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:34,017
<i>- And howdy, Buffalo Bob.
- Howdy there, Mr. Doody. </i>

94
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:37,995
<i>Boys and girls at home and all
our kids here in the gallery, let's go!</i>

95
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:44,070
<i>It's Howdy Doody time</i>

96
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,569
<i>Bob Smith and Howdy too</i>

97
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:51,701
<i>Wave howdy-do to you</i>

98
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,569
Okay.

99
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:19,571
It's not a dream.

100
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,800
It's a nightmare.

101
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,400
And if it's a nightmare,
sooner or later,

102
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,743
there's gonna be a bogeyman.

103
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:35,043
Until the bogeyman showed up,
I decided to ride out the dream.

104
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,521
Not that I had a choice.

105
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,820
Everyone seemed to think it was 1956,

106
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:42,020
and that I was an air force
captain named Tom Stratton...

107
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:46,156
with a wife called Peg
and one and two-thirds children.

108
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:48,792
Evidently, my best friend
was the officer behind the wheel,

109
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:51,803
a Captain Birdell, who
everyone simply called Bird Dog.

110
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:55,237
It didn't take long to find out why.

111
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:59,236
Hey. Hey-hey-hey, hoo-hoo.

112
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:02,406
Look at this.

113
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,585
Oh, my.
And I don't see a wedding ring.

114
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:16,261
Good morning, sweet pea.
How are you?

115
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:19,758
Allow me to introduce myself.

116
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:22,426
I'm Captain Bill Birdell and...

117
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:25,471
well, my facially wounded friend
here is Captain Tom Stratton.

118
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:29,600
You might've heard of us.
We're the only two pilots...

119
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:32,668
in the entire United States Air Force
brave enough to fly the X-2.

120
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:34,872
Oh?

121
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:39,044
What about Tony LaMott?
Oh, Lord.

122
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:41,609
Don't tell me you've been led astray
by that junior birdman.

123
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:44,521
Captain LaMott might have
a complicated wristwatch,

124
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,993
but he ain't anywhere close
to being otherwise test pilot equipped.

125
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:50,996
This being Friday,
I assume you're...

126
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,998
staying at the ranch
as his weekend guest?

127
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:57,332
Well, I'm staying at the ranch.
Then I'll anticipate a dance tonight.

128
00:10:57,403 --> 00:11:01,669
And the sonic booms you hear today
will be dedicated to you.

129
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,758
"Only two guys brave
enough to fly the X-2."

130
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:31,463
You gotta impress the ladies,
pard, if you wanna score.

131
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:33,903
Besides that, it's true.

132
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:36,168
What if I told you I couldn't fly?

133
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:39,370
You sick?
No, I just...

134
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:43,643
When I woke up this morning,
.. couldn't remember how to fly.

135
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:48,648
I like it.
It's so crazy, I like it.

136
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:51,212
Who you gonna pull it on?
It's not a joke.

137
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,487
You sound like you mean it.
I do.

138
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,997
Damn, Tom, that's what makes you
the best, that sincere look.

139
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:03,434
Hell, if I could lie with a straight face
like you, my bird-dogging rate would double.

140
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:07,166
Hey, what say
we pull it on Weird Ernie.

141
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,075
Weird Ernie? Yeah, we'll tell him
that flying faster than Mach 2...

142
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:14,113
is affecting our minds.

143
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,114
Affecting your minds how?

144
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:18,673
It seems the faster I fly,
the less I remember about it.

145
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:23,313
I've experienced that. And I'm starting
to forget things, like my wife's birthday.

146
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:26,790
I never forgot Lucy's birthday
until I flew at Mach 2.5.

147
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:29,487
Last time I busted Mach 2,
I forgot where I parked my car.

148
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,553
That's fascinating.

149
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:34,725
Dr. Berger, could you design a test to
quantify these apparent memory losses?

150
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:40,967
- I should be able to come up with something.
- Good. Good.

151
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,838
This is a most interesting development.
Thank you, gentlemen.

152
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,004
Before we mount up, there's one more thing.
We believe the fire warning light...

153
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,140
Captain Birdell encountered at Mach 2.6
was a result of inadequate insulation.

154
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,310
We've rewired the system,
and we expect no further problems.

155
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:56,014
What's all this "we" stuff?
You gonna be up there with me?

156
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:59,252
I wish I could, Captain LaMott.
I truly wish I could.

157
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:03,591
But as you know, my war wounds
physically disqualify me.

158
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:07,121
If you should experience
a red light around Mach 2.6,

159
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,101
shut down until the chase plane
can catch up and check you over...

160
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,137
for visible signs of fire.

161
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:14,196
A fella could
be barbecued doing that.

162
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:16,833
You get a fire warning light, Tony,
I recommend you punch out.

163
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:21,278
- You didn't eject.
- Yeah, but I'm a damn hero.

164
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,611
You know, I like that guy.

165
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,208
He kind of reminds me of me
back in the old days.

166
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:29,812
All right, all right. If there are no
further questions, gentlemen, let's mount up.

167
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:38,728
Well, he swallowed that
hook, line and slide rule.

168
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:44,334
Now, ain't this a kick in the butt?

169
00:13:56,849 --> 00:14:02,385
Chase One, hold on niner east.

170
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:09,928
Mother Hen, you are cleared to roll.

171
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,590
The pattern is yours.
Good luck.

172
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:19,236
You're my best friends.
I need your honest opinion here.

173
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:22,240
Uh-oh. Which thigh
has less stretch marks?

174
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:25,106
Oh, Lord.
My right one. Okay?

175
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:28,375
Or my left?
Gosh, Peg.

176
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:30,881
You know, I think this
one has less. My right?

177
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,043
They're not as wide either.
Really?

178
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,950
This is the one I'm using
my cactus cream on.

179
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:36,352
No!
Yes!

180
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:07,816
I gotta stop drinking so much coffee.
It's making me jumpy.

181
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,412
Yeah.

182
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:19,464
Given enough time,
you can get used to anything,

183
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:22,262
even a nightmare.

184
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:27,198
All you have to do is relax and...

185
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:29,264
trust those around you.

186
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:35,079
When did you get
into the import business?

187
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:37,615
What are you talking about?
That long-legged honey...

188
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:39,776
staying at the ranch
this weekend.

189
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,184
What's he do, Tom,
smell 'em out?

190
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:44,450
It's a natural gift, son.
It's a natural gift.

191
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,457
Sort of like
a bird dog flushing quail.

192
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:48,993
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I gotta mount up.

193
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:05,110
You know, I'm actually
beginning to enjoy this.

194
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:10,274
I mean, here I am, a daring air force
test pilot who doesn't have to fly.

195
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:12,317
Well, she's all yours, pard.

196
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:16,721
Take her up to 25 while
I answer Mother Nature.

197
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:49,076
Mother Hen heading 2-5-0-2-6-0...

198
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:51,680
at 12,000 and dropping.

199
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:55,352
Mother Hen, Edwards. Radar indicates you are
in a 40-degree-per-minute turn to the right.

200
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,828
Are you experiencing a problem?
Over.

201
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:08,062
Whoa-ooo-ooo!

202
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,702
- What's wrong?
- I can't fly.

203
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:16,771
Bird Dog, Tom,
can you read me? Over.

204
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:25,049
Mother Hen, Edwards.
Do you have a problem? Over.

205
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,093
Uh, Edwards, this is Mother Hen.

206
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,094
We must've had a bubble
in the hydraulic system,

207
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:33,131
'cause for a while, this bird
was flying like a Mack truck.

208
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:35,190
Whatever it was,
we must have burped it out.

209
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:38,532
We are continuing our climb
up to 25,000.

210
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:43,801
You save it for Weird Ernie, pard.
You ain't never gonna sucker me.

211
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:49,137
Just don't ask me to fly.

212
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:25,514
<i>Edwards, Mother Hen.
Level at 25,000.</i>

213
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,848
Roger, Mother Hen.
You are clear to drop.

214
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:32,180
Good luck.

215
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:45,969
Hey, Tony, I'm tired of
hauling your butt around.

216
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:50,270
I'm gonna cut you loose and see which
of us gets back to that blonde first.

217
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,286
Is everybody back there
okay where they're at?

218
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:06,122
Yeah, looks fine to me.

219
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:12,329
All right. 240 indicated.
Here we go, ladies.

220
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:17,195
Drop in ten, nine, eight,

221
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,703
seven, six,

222
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,672
five, four,

223
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,709
three, two,

224
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:26,472
one.

225
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:28,172
Bombs away.

226
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:55,439
Ride her, cowboy.

227
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:09,618
Mach 1.3 and accelerating.

228
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,284
Nosing over.

229
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:18,020
One-nine. Mach 2.

230
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:22,063
All right.
She's leveling off.

231
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:25,069
65,000.

232
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,298
Sixty-six.

233
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:30,536
Level at 71,000.

234
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:33,305
Mach 2.4.

235
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,138
On profile.

236
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:43,251
All right. Starting my run.
Firing rocket three.

237
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:46,553
Mach 2.5.

238
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,460
Two-six.

239
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:57,392
Outside skin temperature. 683.

240
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:59,596
Ain't no fire warning light.

241
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:02,266
I guess we beat that gremlin.

242
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:05,843
Mach 2.7.

243
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:10,847
Two-eight.

244
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:17,981
Skin temperature. 800.

245
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:22,619
Fire warning light.

246
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:26,290
Rockets off.

247
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:35,296
Everything looks okay.
Mach 2.4.

248
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:37,035
2.3.

249
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:40,341
Nah, I think it's
another false alarm.

250
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:44,610
- Hey, where are you, Dougie?
- Five miles behind you at 30,000.

251
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:47,345
Roger. Coming back to you
for a look-see.

252
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:51,281
Don't turn above Mach 2.
Don't turn above Mach 2.

253
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:53,518
Oh, I lost her!

254
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:35,723
Did you see it?

255
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:40,395
There.

256
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:44,565
Oh, God.

257
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:24,809
Well, the X-2 didn't get him,
but she's sure gonna auger him in.

258
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:30,549
- You think so?
- Yeah, he's got that, uh, that sick calf look.

259
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:33,853
Here we go, gang.
Bird Dog's about to pounce.

260
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:36,258
Shoot, he's the only pilot left
in the B.O.Q

261
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:38,796
Be awful lonesome in there
without him.

262
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:41,697
How would you know?
You never sleep in the B.O.Q

263
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,898
As nightmares go, this one is definitely
taking a turn for the better.

264
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:21,896
Even at six months, I found Peg...
stunningly beautiful.

265
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:24,238
Although, I doubt she'd believe it.

266
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:28,336
It could be that pregnant women hold
some strange attraction for me, but...

267
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,608
I think it's Peg.

268
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:33,708
Whatever it is, the chemistry
is definitely working and,

269
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:35,947
well, I'll just have to
keep telling myself...

270
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,285
I'm not really her husband, Tom.

271
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:44,218
Would you like to dance?

272
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:45,854
What?
Dance.

273
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:50,458
With this stomach?
I can reach around it.

274
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:34,237
Well, I wanna know who you've
been dancing with, mister.

275
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:37,305
What? Tom, you may be the
best pilot in the air force,

276
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:41,580
but you were born
with two left feet... until tonight.

277
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:45,453
Maybe I just needed
a well-rounded partner.

278
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:58,459
Peg?
Hmm?

279
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,732
Who's that guy
by the jukebox?

280
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:05,800
That's Doug.

281
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:08,642
No, no, no.
The guy in the tux.

282
00:26:08,714 --> 00:26:11,205
A tux? In here?

283
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,847
You don't see a man in a black tux
standing by the jukebox?

284
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:21,290
Tom, Tom.

285
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,420
Everything is so nice.
Let's not spoil it.

286
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:27,397
Either someone blocked Peg's view
of the guy in the tux,

287
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:30,958
or the bogeyman had arrived.

288
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:34,130
Whichever it was,
I was going to find out.

289
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:36,936
Oh, Tom. No, you're
six months along, Peg.

290
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:39,409
At six months, you dance one,
and then sit one out.

291
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:42,413
Doctor's orders.
But I feel fine,

292
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:44,949
and we never get
a chance to dance.

293
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:49,113
This is my favorite song.
I don't want you to overdo it.

294
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:51,781
Look, we've got
all night, okay?

295
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:53,518
Okay.

296
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:55,958
I'm gonna go feed the old
jukebox. I'll be right back.

297
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:17,345
Isn't this great?

298
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,350
I mean, isn't this just great?

299
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:21,648
Brings back so many old memories.

300
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,280
Hey, have they got
"Be-Bop-A-Lula" on there?

301
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:28,349
Got me through some long,
cold nights at M.I.T.

302
00:27:28,427 --> 00:27:33,865
"Be-Bop" and a little
Lithuanian girl named Danesa.

303
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:35,900
She was in the chemistry lab
researching the...

304
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:38,232
Am I dead?
What?

305
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:40,362
Dead. Am I dead?
It would explain a lot.

306
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:43,431
I could be in a reverse reincarnation
that's entered in midlife.

307
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:49,242
That's a good one, Sam.
You know my name.

308
00:27:49,314 --> 00:27:51,305
I'm not that wasted.

309
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:53,578
Why do you know who I am
when no one else does?

310
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:57,213
Are you serious? Dead
serious. No pun intended.

311
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:02,322
Oh, my God.

312
00:28:02,394 --> 00:28:05,955
You really don't
recognize me, do you? No.

313
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:08,898
Or remember the experiment.
What experiment?

314
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,731
What do you remember
prior to waking up this morning?

315
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:15,705
Other than my name and a telephone
number, not a lot. What experiment?

316
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:19,175
If I'm part of an experiment, then this
all isn't a psychotic hallucination, is it?

317
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:21,235
Is it?

318
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:27,017
Oh, God,
that putz Ziggy was right.

319
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:30,612
Ziggy? I remember a Ziggy.
A little guy with bad breath.

320
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:32,680
You're slipping; pard.

321
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:36,216
Nobody's gonna fall for that old
"talking to somebody who ain't there" gag.

322
00:28:56,648 --> 00:28:58,878
Oh, God. What the hell?

323
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,942
What are we gonna do?

324
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:07,957
- We're in a rotten fix.
I told him not to...

325
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:12,721
Though I don't know

326
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:15,892
Many words of praise

327
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,958
Please, God,

328
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:22,264
I'd like to wake up now.

329
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,972
Put on your bonnet
your cape and your glove

330
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:31,379
And come with me

331
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:35,981
This is KCV530, Victorville.

332
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:40,787
Here's Velton Bunch
and the Dovetones.

333
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,623
I never realized how hard it was
to follow a road without striping.

334
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:46,926
Striping?

335
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:48,932
I was just thinking that,
you know,

336
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,491
if they would paint white stripes
along the side of the road,

337
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,561
it would be easier to see.

338
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:56,807
That's a very good idea, Tom.

339
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:59,776
I got a few of them.

340
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,175
Tonight was fun.

341
00:30:08,253 --> 00:30:10,687
Good.

342
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:13,553
It was a little scary too.
Why scary?

343
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,722
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because...

344
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:19,787
you wanted to dance.

345
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:23,490
It's not the first time
we danced.

346
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:26,560
And you didn't drink more
than one or two beers...

347
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:29,038
or talk flying.

348
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:31,098
I can't remember
the last time you sat...

349
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,508
at a table full of pilots
and you didn't talk airplanes.

350
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:35,512
It seemed to me that's
all we talked about.

351
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,514
That's all they talked about.
You didn't say a word.

352
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:41,712
I wasn't in a talkative mood.
You were at the jukebox.

353
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:51,218
"Why is it... "
"When you... "

354
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:56,030
"Try to pass... "
"The guy in front... "

355
00:30:57,269 --> 00:31:01,228
- "Goes twice as fast?"
- "Burma Shave. "

356
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,904
Oh, it feels nice.

357
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:11,244
How did it work?
Better than my electric razor,

358
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:13,307
uh, would.

359
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,282
I don't use an electric razor, do I? No.

360
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:20,620
No, Tom.

361
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:23,627
What's going on?
I wish I knew.

362
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:28,291
- Honey, just tell me, okay?
- What if I told you my name wasn't Tom?

363
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:30,926
You said that this morning
in the bathroom. It's Sam.

364
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:35,098
Don't ask me what my last name is
because I can't remember it.

365
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:37,698
I look in a mirror, and I see...

366
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,710
Tom Stratton, I guess,

367
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:42,212
but he's not me.

368
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:45,149
I can't fly.

369
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:47,208
In fact,
I don't know what I can do.

370
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,550
When I woke up this morning,

371
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:55,957
I didn't know you or Mikey...
or anyone else at the base.

372
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,221
I know it sounds like I belong
in a loony bin, but it's the truth.

373
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:03,927
The reason I'm acting different
is because I am different.

374
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:08,666
- I'm not your Tom.
- Oh, Tom.

375
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:12,332
Oh, look.

376
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:17,173
Please don't...
Then stop doing this, okay?

377
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:19,911
You asked me to explain...
Just stop it, Tom.

378
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:30,718
I'm sorry, Peg.

379
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:34,888
I'm being a real nerd.

380
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,957
You were right.
I'm setting up a gag.

381
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:41,165
- Thank God.
- I shouldn't have tried it on you.

382
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:43,969
Oh, honey, you had me
scared to death.

383
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:46,408
I thought you had a brain tumor
or something.

384
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:48,946
I never thought of that.
What?

385
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:54,009
Bird Dog and I have been dreaming up
theories to explain why I can't fly.

386
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:56,019
You see, that's the joke.

387
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:58,647
I tell Weird Ernie
that I forgot how to fly.

388
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:01,749
You tell Weird Ernie that
you forgot how to fly. Yeah.

389
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:04,351
Tom, that is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

390
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:08,388
I don't know.
It sounds pretty plausible to me.

391
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:15,937
Tom?
Hmm?

392
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,998
What's a nerd?

393
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:22,676
Well, it, uh...

394
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:16,966
What's the matter?

395
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:20,129
What? Nothing. Go back to sleep.

396
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:22,196
Okay.

397
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:28,939
That's all I need,
a good night's sleep.

398
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:31,208
I'll figure it out in the morning
when I milk the cows.

399
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,208
"Milk the cows"?

400
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:40,315
I was raised
on a dairy farm in Indiana...

401
00:34:40,392 --> 00:34:42,519
until I was 18.

402
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:44,585
I went to college at...

403
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:49,889
Damn, I can't remember.
Stick to the farm.

404
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:53,961
I was raised on a farm with...
my sister Kate.

405
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:56,268
Katie married a naval officer.

406
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,639
Um, Lieutenant John...

407
00:34:59,644 --> 00:35:02,841
No, Jim.
Jim Bonick.

408
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:05,178
Yeah, Katie and Jim Bonick.

409
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,912
Mom's lived with them in Hawaii
ever since...

410
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,845
Dad died in '74.

411
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:17,384
But this is '56.

412
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:24,095
My dad is still alive.

413
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:36,003
Operator.

414
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:41,048
Operator,
I'd like long distance, please.

415
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,110
Long Distance.

416
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:47,648
Indiana, please.

417
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:53,124
Elk Ridge, Indiana.
Number, please.

418
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:58,093
Number, please.

419
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:00,899
I'm-I'm-I'm trying, Operator,
but it's been a long time.

420
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:03,532
Um, it's...

421
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:08,278
Oakdell.

422
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:11,804
Yeah, that's it.
Uh, Oakdell...

423
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:14,750
Sir, why don't you give me
the name of the party,

424
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:17,652
and I will ring
Elk Ridge Information.

425
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,750
Sir?

426
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:24,727
Sir, do you want
Elk Ridge Information?

427
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:35,196
Dad? What's wrong?

428
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:37,741
I'm just...
I'm catching a cold.

429
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:39,800
Wanna skip the fishing trip?

430
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:43,205
- What?
- It's Saturday.

431
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:45,215
You said we'd go fishing today.

432
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:48,218
But we don't have to
if you don't feel good.

433
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:51,478
What are you talking about?

434
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:54,286
Nothing cures a cold
faster than a fishing trip.

435
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:16,603
You don't wanna do that.

436
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:19,309
I just did that to show you
what not to do.

437
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:23,981
I'll bring it back now, and I'll
show you how it should be done.

438
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:32,520
Now, remember, Mikey,
even your best fly fisherman...

439
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:34,724
gets his fly snagged now and then.

440
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:39,236
But it's the old pro
who can bring it back without...

441
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:41,295
Can I try now, Dad?

442
00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:52,576
You stay here and fish this,
uh, pool, all right?

443
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,414
I'm gonna fish further upstream. Roger.

444
00:37:56,421 --> 00:38:00,187
Dad, I know you're trying
to make me look good.

445
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:05,152
Yeah.

446
00:38:26,184 --> 00:38:28,880
Is that a Ginger Quill
spent wing?

447
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:32,047
Or maybe a Blue Dunn?
I don't know.

448
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:35,217
I got such a damn hangover.
It could be a Coors pop-top.

449
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:41,865
Don't yell, please!

450
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:44,493
I should've stayed in bed
with Tina.

451
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,800
You still don't
remember me, huh?

452
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:49,863
That's sad, pal, very sad.

453
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:51,875
My name is Albert.

454
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:54,810
Albert what, I can't tell you,
because it's restricted.

455
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:57,712
Most of what you're gonna
wanna know is restricted.

456
00:38:57,782 --> 00:39:00,808
So it'll be easier for us if you
don't ask a lot of questions.

457
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:03,547
- What are you?
- That's a question, Sam.

458
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:07,182
I'm a man, like you.

459
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,985
Mmm.

460
00:39:13,698 --> 00:39:17,259
- Not like me.
- Oh, no, uh, this isn't me.

461
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,065
This is, uh,
a neurological hologram.

462
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:23,164
It's an image that only
you can see and hear.

463
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:25,402
Created by a subatomic
agitation of carbon quarks...

464
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:28,240
...tuned to the mesons
of my optic and optic neurons?

465
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:32,214
- You got it.
- How did I know that?

466
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:37,988
Ziggy has come up with five
different scenarios to ex...

467
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:38,788
Ziggy!

468
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:41,809
Ziggy, a little guy with bad breath.

469
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,020
No, that's Gooshie.

470
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:46,029
He programs Ziggy.
Ziggy's a hybrid computer.

471
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:50,295
Hybrid computers and neurological
holograms didn't exist in 1956.

472
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:52,893
Only in theory.
But this is '56.

473
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,700
Well, it is for you.
It is not for me.

474
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:57,707
What's my last name?

475
00:39:57,775 --> 00:40:00,073
If you can't remember, I
can't tell you. It's important.

476
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:03,375
But it's also on top of Ziggy's
no-no list, double-starred.

477
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:05,382
Why?
I can't tell you that either.

478
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,384
What the hell can you tell me?

479
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:10,182
Basically, what you already know.

480
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:14,213
that you're, uh, part of
a time-travel experiment...

481
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:16,283
that went a little caca.

482
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:19,653
"A little caca"?

483
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:24,661
- How little caca?
- Well, you're here, which is a biggie.

484
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:26,829
I mean, that's a first.
It's Nobel Prize time.

485
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:28,838
You should be proud of that.
And?

486
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:31,773
And, uh, uh,
we're experiencing...

487
00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:35,006
technical difficulties in,
uh, retrieving you.

488
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:40,110
That's great, Al.

489
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:43,420
I wake up in '56 with a memory
like Swiss cheese,

490
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:45,513
and you're experiencing
technical difficulties?

491
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,423
Whose brainchild is this, yours?

492
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:52,294
No, not mine.

493
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:55,730
I haven't got a lot of time. I have
to find out which of these scenarios...

494
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,792
can explain why we couldn't
retrieve you this morning.

495
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,668
You tried? Of course we
tried. You wouldn't leap.

496
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:03,866
So now it's my fault.
Possibly.

497
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:06,967
Did you tell anyone
that you're not Tom Stratton?

498
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,514
Sort of.
Oh, Sam.

499
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:14,176
Retrieving you is dependent upon
everyone here...

500
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:16,345
believing that you're
the person you replaced.

501
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,548
They didn't believe me. I look in
a mirror, and I don't believe me.

502
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:23,390
That's to be expected.
To us, Tom looks just like you.

503
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:26,730
He's with you?
Of course.

504
00:41:26,798 --> 00:41:29,961
How do you think we located you?
When you went in, he came out.

505
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:33,561
If it's any consolation,
his memory is full of holes too.

506
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:37,199
Now, everyone has to believe
that you're Tom Stratton...

507
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:39,869
if we're gonna be able
to retrieve you on Tuesday.

508
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:42,071
Tuesday.

509
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:45,908
Tuesday's gonna be a little late.

510
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:48,781
I'm, uh...

511
00:41:48,853 --> 00:41:52,289
I'm scheduled to test-fly
the X-2 on Monday.

512
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,851
Did you ever think
of taking flying lessons?

513
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:03,290
Just a thought.

514
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,240
All right, give me the big one.
Right down the middle.

515
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,082
Not bad, not bad. Right in
the glove. Right in the glove.

516
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:23,643
Right down the middle. No batter,
no batter, no batter, no batter.

517
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:26,246
What you need
is a little Texas sauce.

518
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:29,919
Yeah! Ow. Mmm.

519
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:33,555
How does he do it?
Probably wearing his hat.

520
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:40,698
Sometimes Doug
wears his goggles.

521
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:44,868
Well, I think it's sexy.

522
00:42:44,942 --> 00:42:48,207
I mean, if anything,
that spin became even flatter.

523
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:50,804
Hi, baby.

524
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:54,750
I mean, I didn't want to punch out
inverted, but what the hell else could I do?

525
00:42:57,822 --> 00:43:01,280
All right.

526
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:33,449
Yeah!

527
00:43:33,524 --> 00:43:35,151
Wow!

528
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:38,684
Did you see that roll and flip
he did at the top, Dad?

529
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:41,698
What do you call it?
You got me.

530
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:48,105
- The chandelle, Mikey.
- Wow! It sure was something.

531
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:53,133
Yeah, it sure was.

532
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,008
I'd better help your mom.

533
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,173
Aw, Dad.
Unless you wanna set the table.

534
00:43:58,249 --> 00:44:00,342
Hey, Captain Crawford,
wanna play catch?

535
00:44:00,418 --> 00:44:02,784
Sure do.
Fire one on in there, Mikey.

536
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:16,389
Hi.
Hi.

537
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:22,765
You okay?
I'm fine.

538
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:27,508
You look a little pale.
Yeah, well, it's the heat.

539
00:44:27,578 --> 00:44:29,512
I'll never get used to it.

540
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,481
You want me to help?
I make a mean Caesar salad.

541
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,178
I'm just kidding.
I know.

542
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:38,382
But not about how you look.

543
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:40,447
Well, that's your fault.

544
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:44,453
That's not what I meant.
Look, I'm fine.

545
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:46,462
I really am.

546
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,658
Why don't you just go back
on out there with Mikey?

547
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:54,171
You know, you haven't spent this much
time with him since he was hit by the bus.

548
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,431
Okay.

549
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:03,380
Hey, flyboy.

550
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:25,328
Come and get it.
Uh...

551
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:27,667
Got to eat trout
while it's sizzling.

552
00:45:27,738 --> 00:45:29,706
Yeah.

553
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:33,141
Why don't you take the salad out?
I'll get the rolls.

554
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,235
Yeah.

555
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:52,292
I'm sorry to pull you
from your barbecue,

556
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:54,460
but Dr. Berger and I have just
finished a questionnaire...

557
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:58,400
to test Captain Birdell's theory that Mach
3 flight has a negative effect on the memory.

558
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:01,131
Quite frankly, if this theory had
come from you, I'd be skeptical.

559
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:04,697
We all know your penchant
for practical jokes, eh?

560
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:07,608
Doctor, any memory loss
I suffer won't be faked.

561
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:10,044
We're going to call it the
Ernst-Berger Engramic Standard.

562
00:46:10,114 --> 00:46:14,312
200 questions designed to
benchmark a person's memory.

563
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:17,320
I thought we were gonna call it
the Berger-Ernst Engramic Standard.

564
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:18,855
Hi, Tom.
Hi.

565
00:46:18,923 --> 00:46:21,858
These questions should give us
a cross section of your memory.

566
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:25,828
Some, like your age, place of birth,
are the usual statistics.

567
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:29,388
But I think you'll find
most are rather unusual.

568
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:32,265
What was the coldest
you've ever been?

569
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:34,327
Who was your second-best friend
in college?

570
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:37,507
Where did you first make love?

571
00:46:39,477 --> 00:46:41,638
Well, at least you didn't ask to who.

572
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:43,805
Dr. Ernst suggested that,

573
00:46:43,881 --> 00:46:47,146
but where is as meaningful
and more discreet.

574
00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:49,209
Sort of a personal "Trivial Pursuit"?

575
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:53,056
Not a bad name.

576
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:55,354
The Berger-Ernst
Engramic Trivial Pursuit.

577
00:46:55,426 --> 00:46:59,157
Ernst-Berger. We'll need this filled
out before you take off on Monday.

578
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,164
You'll fill it out
again when you land.

579
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:04,497
If there are any significant changes in your
memory, we should be able to detect them.

580
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:07,264
- Any questions, Captain?
- Uh, no, no.

581
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:11,502
It seems simple enough. I’ll, hum...
I'll have it for you on Monday.

582
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,667
Doctors.

583
00:47:21,352 --> 00:47:24,844
Doctor, we could be on the verge
of a momentous discovery.

584
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:28,824
Or the butt of a momentous joke.

585
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:10,726
Pretty simple, huh?

586
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:12,632
Can't you just
fade in or something?

587
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:17,265
You tell me how to fade in agitated carbon
quarks, and I'll make the Scientific Journal.

588
00:48:17,341 --> 00:48:22,176
Just don't sneak up on me. You
still don't remember our project?

589
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:26,979
Bad enough I have to give Dick-and-Jane
explanations to the president.

590
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:30,543
I've gotta give you one too.
All right.

591
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:34,022
One end of this string
represents your birth.

592
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:39,688
The other end, your death. You tie the
ends together, and your life is a loop.

593
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:42,391
Ball the loop...

594
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:47,664
and the days of your life
touch each other out of sequence.

595
00:48:47,738 --> 00:48:50,730
Therefore, leaping from one point
of the string to another...

596
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:53,208
Would move you backward or forward
within your own lifetime.

597
00:48:53,277 --> 00:48:55,939
Which is our project,
Quantum Leap!

598
00:48:57,781 --> 00:48:59,715
I can't remember.

599
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,382
Al! I wish you would stop doing that.

600
00:49:05,456 --> 00:49:07,515
What?

601
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:09,923
Walking through things.

602
00:49:09,994 --> 00:49:14,795
Well, you want me to walk around something that
isn't even here? All right, I'll walk around it.

603
00:49:14,865 --> 00:49:18,892
There. How's that?
Why- Why isn't it here?

604
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:24,032
I'm a hologram to you, right? Well, you and
everything around you is a hologram to me.

605
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:27,305
You're in the imaging
chamber. You remember.

606
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:29,938
Vaguely. A cavern somewhere. New Mexico.

607
00:49:30,014 --> 00:49:32,505
What year is it there?

608
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:36,417
You'll find that out...
if we get you back. If?

609
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:39,251
Well, see, Ziggy's theory is really...
It's a load of crap.

610
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:43,282
I mean, you gotta believe
that God or time or something...

611
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,694
was just waiting for
your quantum leap to, uh,

612
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:51,223
to correct a mistake.
A mistake in time?

613
00:49:51,302 --> 00:49:54,897
Something that happened in the life
of Captain Tom Stratton in '56,

614
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:57,236
since he's the one you bounced out.

615
00:49:57,308 --> 00:50:01,335
Once that's put right,
you'll snap back like a pimp's suspenders.

616
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:02,879
Once what's put right?

617
00:50:02,946 --> 00:50:07,406
Tom Stratton was killed
trying to break Mach 3 in the X-2.

618
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:12,353
If Ziggy's right,
all you have to do is break Mach 3...

619
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:13,947
and live.

620
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:21,731
Hey!
No way.

621
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:24,199
Hey, pal, it's not my theory.
There's gotta be another way.

622
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:26,566
The next one's only got
a 52% chance of working.

623
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:28,571
I'll take it.

624
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:31,972
It requires you to be at ground zero
during an atomic detonation.

625
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:36,202
You asked.
What else have you got?

626
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,681
This isn't a shopping list, you know.

627
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,150
The odds drop into
the low teens after that.

628
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:47,384
Your best shot is freezing the brain
until all electrical activity has ceased.

629
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:50,894
That's called death.
I never said it would be easy.

630
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:55,298
Hey, slow down, will ya?
I'm fighting a hangover.

631
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:57,891
All right, you want a sure thing?
I got it for you.

632
00:50:57,968 --> 00:51:01,495
You don't do anything. You just live.
Barring accidental death...

633
00:51:01,572 --> 00:51:04,268
or a fatal disease,
you'll be back in 40 years.

634
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:07,310
That's your safest option.
And Tom Stratton?

635
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:10,006
He'll go on living forward
from where he's at now.

636
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,176
Technically, he could end up
the oldest man alive.

637
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:18,415
Well, what about Peg and Mikey? I don't want to
hurt them, but I can't go on pretending I'm Tom.

638
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:21,856
Hey, they were gonna
lose him on Monday anyway.

639
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:25,258
Of course,
if you bust Mach 3 and survive,

640
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:28,457
they could have him around for
another 30 or 40 years. I can't fly!

641
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:30,466
I'll be your copilot.
You're a hologram.

642
00:51:30,534 --> 00:51:34,493
I'm also an ex-astronaut. The hardest part
about flying is taking off and landing.

643
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:38,940
The B-50 does the first part for you.
After that, you just fire a couple of rockets,

644
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:42,172
hang on to the stick
and ka-za-zoom, Mach 3.

645
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:44,840
And the second part?
Landing?

646
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:50,811
You could never land the X-2, not
even with my help. So, you don't.

647
00:51:50,888 --> 00:51:53,686
I eject?
Mmm.

648
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:56,988
X-2 does a crash and burn.
You float back to earth on a pillow of silk.

649
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,791
The moment you touch down, you leap forward,
Tom leaps back, and the broad and I...

650
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:03,196
are gone to Las Vegas.
It might work.

651
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:05,201
Of course it'll work.

652
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:07,635
A minute ago
you said it was crap.

653
00:52:10,874 --> 00:52:13,365
That was before I thought it out.

654
00:52:56,753 --> 00:52:59,221
Tom?

655
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:02,747
You should be asleep.
And you shouldn't be?

656
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:12,193
You're worried about breaking
the record tomorrow, aren't you?

657
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:17,273
No.

658
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:22,369
Oh, honey, you'll do it.
You're gonna be the fastest man alive.

659
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,611
Tom...

660
00:53:34,558 --> 00:53:36,492
promise me.

661
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,018
What?
No, you have to promise first.

662
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:43,066
Well, that's silly. How can I promise
something if I don't know what...

663
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:46,830
Just promise.

664
00:53:49,006 --> 00:53:52,498
I promise.

665
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:54,635
Now, what did I promise?

666
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:58,443
I'll tell you tomorrow night.

667
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:38,010
Thanks, guys.

668
00:54:43,193 --> 00:54:46,788
Well, ready to become
the fastest man on earth?

669
00:54:46,863 --> 00:54:50,629
Ready as I'll ever be.

670
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:53,898
Oh. What did you
think of this, Tom?

671
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:59,375
Well, I'm not sure how useful it'll be
to gauge a memory loss, but, uh,

672
00:54:59,443 --> 00:55:03,436
filling it out last night sure brought back
a lot of old ones for me.

673
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:37,538
Well, my boobs
are as big as Marilyn's.

674
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:41,050
Lucy, you're
five months pregnant.

675
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:45,213
Well, maybe she is too. Why else
would a guy like Miller marry her?

676
00:55:45,214 --> 00:55:46,053
Guess.

677
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:51,393
Sally, he's a writer.
They're only used to the finer things in life.

678
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:53,793
Honey, there is nothing finer in life.

679
00:55:53,864 --> 00:55:56,924
You are so bad!

680
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:38,466
<i>There's a yellow rose in Texas</i>

681
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:41,136
<i>That I am gonna see</i>

682
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:43,475
<i>Nobody else could miss her</i>

683
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:46,072
<i>Not half as much as me</i>

684
00:56:46,149 --> 00:56:48,083
<i>She cried so when I left her</i>

685
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:50,620
Hey, wait a minute. Listen to this.

686
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:52,383
<i>It like to broke my heart</i>

687
00:56:52,456 --> 00:56:56,517
<i>And if I ever find her
we'll never fall apart</i>

688
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:58,959
If you don't clear this radio,
Captain Birdell,

689
00:56:59,029 --> 00:57:02,192
the only yellow rose you'll be seeing will be
the one I'll shove up your afterburners.

690
00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:05,757
- Is that clear? Over.
- Uh, that's a roger, Edwards.

691
00:57:08,438 --> 00:57:11,134
Read this.

692
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:15,736
"Date of birth,
August 8th, 19... 53."

693
00:57:15,812 --> 00:57:19,373
- Well, that's a typo. He means 1923.
- Keep reading.

694
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:24,410
"What had the most positive impact on
me in high school? Answer: miniskirts.

695
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:32,086
"What had the most negative impact
on me in high school? Answer: panty hose? "

696
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:39,568
It's time to mount up, Tom.

697
00:57:39,636 --> 00:57:43,402
Hey, Tom, this is gonna sound
a little weird, but...

698
00:57:43,473 --> 00:57:47,341
right before I got the fire warning light,
I swear I smelled coffee brewing.

699
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,072
Maybe it's one of
Weird Ernie's gremlins.

700
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:52,081
Yeah, maybe.

701
00:57:52,149 --> 00:57:54,310
Good luck, Tom.

702
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:10,592
Where are you, Albert?

703
00:58:21,444 --> 00:58:23,469
Hmm.

704
00:58:32,122 --> 00:58:35,956
"When feeling lonely, I rent a video
and microwave some popcorn. "

705
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:39,962
This is gibberish.
Very creative gibberish.

706
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:42,726
Captain Stratton has answered
each question as if he had...

707
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,563
been born in '53
and lived in the future.

708
00:58:45,635 --> 00:58:48,695
Then this whole memory loss thing
is another one of their hoaxes.

709
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:51,570
I'm afraid so.
Well, how stupid do they think I am?

710
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:54,633
Pet rocks. Water beds.

711
00:58:54,711 --> 00:58:58,374
What was it he said he was expelled
from college for? Uh, streaking.

712
00:58:58,448 --> 00:59:01,884
He's got a sick mind, Doctor.
They all do.

713
00:59:04,254 --> 00:59:06,245
Maybe they have to.

714
00:59:10,393 --> 00:59:14,921
Okay.

715
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:22,764
Uh, Albert?

716
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,830
Locked tight. All set, Captain.
Good luck.

717
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:14,388
<i>Edwards, Mother Hen.
Level at 25,000.</i>

718
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:19,087
Roger, Mother Hen.
You are clear to drop.

719
01:00:19,162 --> 01:00:21,528
Good luck.

720
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:24,692

724
01:00:36,646 --> 01:00:39,206
Bombs away.

01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:46,412
<i>Albert.!</i>

726
01:00:48,558 --> 01:00:52,324
<i>X-2, Chase One.
Do you have a problem? Over. </i>

727
01:00:52,395 --> 01:00:55,159
I can't fly.

728
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:58,564
Relax. I can.
Al?

729
01:00:58,635 --> 01:01:03,470
Al? Where are you?
Right here.

730
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:07,169
<i>Hey, Tom, do you read me?
Come in, X-2.</i>

731
01:01:07,243 --> 01:01:11,179
Follow my lead.
Light off one and two.

732
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,287
It's a kick in the butt, ain't it?

733
01:01:20,357 --> 01:01:22,689
Match my movements.

734
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:41,370
Where the hell were you?

735
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:43,878
I was at the Laker game.
It went into overtime.

736
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:46,745
A ball game? I nearly died
because you were at a ball game?

737
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:50,980
It wasn’t just a ball game.
It was a play-off game.

738
01:01:51,054 --> 01:01:54,319
At the party later,
I met this dish named Martha.

739
01:01:54,391 --> 01:01:58,384
I guess I can thank God you didn't
spend the night with this Martha.

740
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:03,125
Well, I did.
Uh, coming up on Mach 1.

741
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:05,224
Coming up on Mach 1.

742
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:22,947
Mach 1.3.
Nosing over.

743
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:25,613
Mach 1.3. 50,000.
N- N-Nosing over.

744
01:02:25,688 --> 01:02:28,020
Now ease the stick forward.
That's enough.

745
01:02:31,094 --> 01:02:33,995
Mach 1.7.

746
01:02:34,064 --> 01:02:36,032
Mach 2. 68, 69.

747
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:39,830
Mach 2.

748
01:02:39,903 --> 01:02:45,273
Level at 70,000.
Mach 2.4. On a profile.

749
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:48,208
Level at 70,000.
Mach 2.4.

750
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:50,610
On profile.

751
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:54,879
Wow.!

752
01:02:56,653 --> 01:02:58,883
It's incredible!

753
01:03:00,423 --> 01:03:05,451
- What now?
- Punch three and go for it.

754
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:15,503
Mach 2.4, 2.5.
Outside skin temperature. 685.

755
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:20,635
- Mach 2.7. Skin temperature. 750.
- Ride her, cowboy.

756
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,916
Mach 2.8.

757
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:30,680
- Do you hear that?
- Mach 2.9. Yes.

758
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:38,352
Tony didn't smell coffee.
He heard it perking.

759
01:03:38,428 --> 01:03:41,295
It's the fuel, Sam.

760
01:03:41,364 --> 01:03:45,391
The heat is boiling the fuel.
Shut 'em down, Sam. Shut 'em down!

761
01:03:45,468 --> 01:03:46,901
Shut 'em down.!

762
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:14,254
Pull, Sam. Eject.!

763
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,989
I'm still here.
No, damn it, I'm still here.!

764
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,591
Al!

765
01:05:40,049 --> 01:05:43,712
You know, Captain, we could be combing the
desert with tweezers and little glass jars...

766
01:05:43,786 --> 01:05:46,653
looking for what's left of you.

767
01:05:46,723 --> 01:05:51,160
You guys are all alike. Losing your
plane's worse than losing your wife.

768
01:05:51,227 --> 01:05:54,060
I'd trade my ex-wife
for any wreck they got.

769
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:57,657
I'm still here.
Hmm. 'Bout time you realized it.

770
01:05:57,734 --> 01:05:59,725
What now? I'm going to
take your blood pressure.

771
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:02,566
We could try the A-bomb
theory. No, thank you.

772
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:06,302
Well, I'm sorry, but it's
necessary. It's not my theory, Sam.

773
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:11,006
I never bought into that "good deed,
put time right" bull. Not really.

774
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,378
So I'm stuck here?
I don't think so.

775
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:17,385
Maybe not. A few tests at the hospital,
and you should be able to go home.

776
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:20,081
Maybe you could leap back when you least
suspect it, like tonight when you're sleeping.

777
01:06:20,156 --> 01:06:23,353
Do you really believe that?
Absolutely. I don't know.

778
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:25,792
I don't see any reason to keep you
in the hospital. But in the meantime,

779
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:29,389
there's no reason for me to stay here,
and I would feel really bad...

780
01:06:29,465 --> 01:06:34,266
if Martha woke up and found out that I'd gone
without even saying good morning, you know?

781
01:06:34,337 --> 01:06:36,464
It's not nice.

782
01:06:38,675 --> 01:06:41,235
Unless your blood pressure
keeps elevating.

783
01:06:50,787 --> 01:06:56,190
<i>Dr. Berger,
please contact the ward nurse. </i>

784
01:06:56,259 --> 01:06:58,250
Daddy!

785
01:06:59,595 --> 01:07:02,621
Hey.
Hey, I'm okay.

786
01:07:07,337 --> 01:07:11,364
Peg went into premature labor
when she heard the crash.

787
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:13,432
Okay, I'll be right.

788
01:07:16,412 --> 01:07:20,906
Look, I know you want
to be with your mom.

789
01:07:20,983 --> 01:07:23,008
And you will.
But, uh,

790
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:27,284
right now I want you to stay
with Sally and Lucy, okay?

791
01:07:27,357 --> 01:07:31,316
They're both pregnant, and they're
very frightened. You understand?

792
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:35,392
Yes, sir.

793
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:38,400
She'll be fine, son.

794
01:07:38,468 --> 01:07:40,459
I promise.

795
01:07:44,474 --> 01:07:46,465
Tom, what...

796
01:07:55,585 --> 01:07:57,519
Is she dilated any further?

797
01:07:57,587 --> 01:08:00,078
Tom. Tom!

798
01:08:01,824 --> 01:08:04,759
Oh.! Oh.!

799
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:06,818
Oh!

800
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:14,900
Oh, I knew
you'd keep your promise.

801
01:08:14,971 --> 01:08:17,405
It'll take more than
a gremlin to kill me.

802
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:20,135
Hey, did you set a record?

803
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:24,839
I guess so.
Oh, I'm so proud of you!

804
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:31,709
Look at me. Look at me.
Take a deep breath.

805
01:08:31,788 --> 01:08:34,985
Hold it...
and let it out like this.

806
01:08:44,033 --> 01:08:46,661
Okay?

807
01:08:46,736 --> 01:08:49,899
Where did you learn to do that? Premed.

808
01:08:51,474 --> 01:08:53,499
Oh, Tom!

809
01:08:55,445 --> 01:08:57,675
Excuse me. Tom?

810
01:08:59,982 --> 01:09:01,916
I'll be right back.

811
01:09:07,423 --> 01:09:10,290
Tom, this is Dr. Blaustein.

812
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:15,092
It's not good, Captain. The baby's
gonna arrive at least nine weeks premature.

813
01:09:15,164 --> 01:09:18,361
The nearest neonatal
intensive care unit's in L.A.

814
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:19,830
Now, we've got a plane standing by...

815
01:09:19,831 --> 01:09:22,063
but considering the shock
that your wife's been through...

816
01:09:22,138 --> 01:09:24,072
I don't want to risk moving her.

817
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:29,077
It's your decision, Tom. I'd recommend
delivering here and flying the baby to L.A.

818
01:09:29,145 --> 01:09:32,512
The baby won't have a chance.
Not much, but your wife will.

819
01:09:34,283 --> 01:09:38,777
Dr. Cooper to O.R. 3.
Dr. Cooper to O.R. 3.

820
01:09:38,855 --> 01:09:40,948
How far apart are
the contractions?

821
01:09:41,023 --> 01:09:43,890
It's early labor. It's just
started. How far dilated?

822
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,451
Two centimeters,
and the cervix is partial effaced.

823
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:51,489
Then it's early enough to stop. Captain,
once labor's started you can't stop it.

824
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:56,595
Of course you can. Start her on
a beta sympathomimetic. A what?

825
01:09:56,672 --> 01:09:59,539
A beta sympathomimetic.

826
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:04,376
I'm not sure which one. Obstetrics isn't
my specialty. Probably ritodrine or terbuta...

827
01:10:04,447 --> 01:10:08,474
Hell, those didn't come out till the
late '70s. Excuse us a minute, Doctor.

828
01:10:08,551 --> 01:10:11,748
Captain, the only reason I'm not
kicking you from here to the flight line...

829
01:10:11,821 --> 01:10:13,686
is that woman down the hall needs you.

830
01:10:13,756 --> 01:10:18,352
She doesn't have to deliver. I know what
I'm talking about. Now you're a doctor?

831
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:20,588
Evidently.

832
01:10:20,663 --> 01:10:22,961
Tom, considering what
you've been through today,

833
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:25,728
I'm gonna make an allowance
for your behavior up to now.

834
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:29,760
But if you persist in wasting our time with
this little sham you and Captain Birdell...

835
01:10:29,839 --> 01:10:33,434
are trying to perpetrate, mister,
I'll see you never fly again!

836
01:10:33,509 --> 01:10:36,410
It's not a sham.
Those answers are true.

837
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:40,939
Dr. Ernst was right.
You are one sick bastard.

838
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:43,042
Alcohol.

839
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:46,452
A five percent solution of ethanol
alcohol in dextrose and water...

840
01:10:46,522 --> 01:10:48,513
intravenously administered
will stop labor.

841
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:52,721
The technique was developed in the '60s.
Beta sympathomimetics replaced it in the '70s.

842
01:10:52,795 --> 01:10:55,389
But it'll still work.
Use your brain, damn it!

843
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:58,262
What will an intravenous
five percent solution of alcohol do?

844
01:10:59,335 --> 01:11:01,326
Get her instantly drunk,

845
01:11:02,838 --> 01:11:06,638
which will interfere
with the oxytocins...

846
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:09,769
her brain's releasing
to stimulate the uterine contractions.

847
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:14,373
Thank you.

848
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:16,475
Did you hear any of that, Barry?
Yeah, I did.

849
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:20,181
What do you think? Well, let's give
it a try. Nurse, prepare an I.V...

850
01:11:20,256 --> 01:11:24,215
Que sera, sera

851
01:11:24,293 --> 01:11:29,424
Whatever will be, will be

852
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:34,265
The future's not ours to see

853
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:37,898
Que sera, sera

854
01:11:37,974 --> 01:11:43,537
What will be, will be

855
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:48,383
Well, what do you think, boys?

856
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:52,114
We have Doris Day
for a patient. Well?

857
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:56,420
She's gonna have one beaut of a
hangover, but she's not gonna deliver.

858
01:11:56,492 --> 01:11:58,738
Do you want to tell me how
in the hell Captain Stratton...

859
01:11:58,739 --> 01:11:59,620
Barry, do me a favor.

860
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:02,664
Hmm?
Don't ask.

861
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,967
Hey, flyboy,
the squares are gone.

862
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:09,027
You wanna boogie?

863
01:12:18,648 --> 01:12:21,276
I love you.

864
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,648
I love you too, Peg.

865
01:13:23,913 --> 01:13:27,007
Hey, Fox.!
Fox, what ya posing for?

866
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:30,314
Ain't nobody gonna take your picture.

867
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:46,665
Nice catch, Foxy.

868
01:13:46,736 --> 01:13:50,365
This is it, folks.
Down by five, the last of the ninth.

869
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:55,103
Unless the Bombers can pull a miracle and
win this final game of the 68th season,

870
01:13:55,177 --> 01:13:58,044
it's the cellar
for the third year in a row.

871
01:13:58,114 --> 01:14:02,642
The bottom of the ninth is brought to
you tonight, as it has been all year long,

872
01:14:02,718 --> 01:14:05,186
by Shneck and Shneck
Funeral Parlors,

873
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:09,623
serving Waco and
the Texas Hill Country for 43 years.

874
01:14:09,692 --> 01:14:12,991
All right, now, put some fire under it.!

875
01:14:13,062 --> 01:14:17,897
Hustle, boys! Now hustle!
We're gonna beat these Okies.

876
01:14:35,117 --> 01:14:38,382
Fox! Do something!

877
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:40,718
Me? Why me?

878
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,314
It's your dog.

879
01:14:44,593 --> 01:14:48,427
He knew. The little sucker knew.

880
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:51,523
And he wasn't gonna stop barking
until they all knew.

881
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,330
Stray dogs are pretty common
on the farm belt,

882
01:14:54,403 --> 01:14:57,861
and one of the first things my dad taught
me was how to face the wild ones down.

883
01:14:59,074 --> 01:15:02,100
You look them straight in the eye,
and you let 'em know who's boss.

884
01:15:10,352 --> 01:15:14,550
Of course, it had been a long time
since I was a kid.

885
01:15:17,026 --> 01:15:19,051
Then again,

886
01:15:21,463 --> 01:15:25,126
once you've got the touch,
you never lose it.

887
01:15:25,201 --> 01:15:27,726
- That's the damnedest thing I ever saw.
- How'd you teach him that, Foxy?

888
01:15:27,803 --> 01:15:29,794
Well... Aah!

889
01:15:31,807 --> 01:15:34,537
Barnes lines a solid shot
down the aisle in right center.

890
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:38,444
Pace is chasing it back into the corner.
Barnes is rounding first.

891
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:43,584
Here comes the throw to second, and he
- Safe!

892
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:45,313
He's safe!

893
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:50,256
Well, the Bombers get their second hit
of the game, and it's a double! Oh!

894
01:15:52,294 --> 01:15:56,788
No wonder they're in the cellar. They got
about as much enthusiasm as a $10 hooker.

895
01:15:56,866 --> 01:15:58,834
Come on.

896
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:01,836
I want to watch the game.
Will you follow me?

897
01:16:01,904 --> 01:16:05,931
- I can't. I'm up after Matt.
- Yeah. Right.

898
01:16:06,008 --> 01:16:09,774
- Something wrong, Fox?
- Uh, no. I'm gonna...

899
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:13,679
I'll be back in a minute. I'm
just gonna,... you know.

900
01:16:13,749 --> 01:16:16,217
Make it snappy.

901
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:19,082
Strike!

902
01:16:19,154 --> 01:16:23,682
The next son of a gun that swings at
the first pitch, I'm gonna fine 50 bucks!

903
01:16:23,759 --> 01:16:25,750
Al!

904
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:34,462
How'd you get here so fast?

905
01:16:34,536 --> 01:16:37,164
It's been a week since
you quantum leaped. A week?

906
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:40,834
A couple of minutes ago
I was in the hospital with Peg.

907
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:44,607
Well, you've been bouncing
around in time, Sam.

908
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,944
It may have seemed like
a couple of minutes to you,

909
01:16:47,016 --> 01:16:50,543
but we've been popping
champagne for six days.

910
01:16:50,619 --> 01:16:53,315
Oh, it was a hell of a party too.

911
01:16:53,389 --> 01:16:57,758
Gooshie, he got so wasted that
he had Ziggy printing X-rated pictures.

912
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:00,454
And you know Brenda,
the cute little redhead in coding?

913
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:03,555
She got so turned on!

914
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:06,294
No, I don't know Brenda,
or I don't remember Brenda.

915
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:08,734
And I certainly don't care
how turned on she got.

916
01:17:08,804 --> 01:17:12,001
I'm in a real identity crisis here, Al.

917
01:17:12,074 --> 01:17:15,635
I mean, one minute I'm Tom Stratton,
and the next I'm a ball player named Fox.

918
01:17:15,711 --> 01:17:20,512
Tim Fox, 32-year-old third baseman
for the Waco Bombers.

919
01:17:20,582 --> 01:17:25,019
According to Ziggy, you hit... 415 in
'63 and got called up to Chicago...

920
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:30,992
where you broke your leg sliding into
second and got sent back down to recover.

921
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,324
That was five years ago.

922
01:17:44,606 --> 01:17:46,540
Oh, boy!

923
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:49,577
Hey, come on, Sam.
We're missing the game!

924
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:52,375
The hell with the game!
It's your last one in organized ball.

925
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:55,212
In a couple of minutes
you're gonna fly out to center.

926
01:17:55,284 --> 01:17:57,309
The Bombers are gonna finish
another season in the cellar,

927
01:17:57,386 --> 01:18:00,913
and you're gonna hang up
your spikes. Then what?

928
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:04,255
Well, you're gonna open up a Kentucky
Fried Chicken franchise. What?

929
01:18:04,326 --> 01:18:06,590
You'll marry a girl named Sue
and have two kids.

930
01:18:06,662 --> 01:18:08,596
Of course, you don't have to be
around for all of that.

931
01:18:08,664 --> 01:18:14,068
Soon as we can figure out what needs
to be put right, you'll leap outta here.

932
01:18:14,136 --> 01:18:17,367
Like fly the X-2
to Mach 3 and live?

933
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:19,236
Hey, Ziggy blew it!
Yeah.

934
01:18:19,308 --> 01:18:23,472
He didn't research it enough.
Originally, Tom Stratton not only died,

935
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:26,981
but his wife went into premature labor,
and the baby was stillborn.

936
01:18:27,049 --> 01:18:28,573
And now?
Tom's alive!

937
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:32,313
Peg gave birth to a healthy baby girl,
seven pounds, eight ounces.

938
01:18:32,388 --> 01:18:36,324
Funny thing.
They happened to name her Samantha.

939
01:18:36,392 --> 01:18:39,418
Seems like someone wanted
both Tom and Samantha to survive.

940
01:18:39,495 --> 01:18:41,087
Yeah.

941
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:44,064
Come on, Jackson's up.
He's gonna hit a homer with one on!

942
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:48,534
You're a vampire.

943
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:52,631
What? Neurological
holograms don't reflect, Sam.

944
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:56,769
Obviously when it comes to quantum
physics, you're still a mental slug.

945
01:18:56,845 --> 01:18:59,643
But we can talk about this later.
Come on. I hate to miss the game.

946
01:18:59,715 --> 01:19:02,240
You already know how
it's going to end.

947
01:19:02,317 --> 01:19:08,051
I knew how it was gonna end
when I took Brenda into the filing room.

948
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:10,284
I still took her.

949
01:19:12,761 --> 01:19:15,924
There's the homer.
Why didn't I leap all the way?

950
01:19:15,998 --> 01:19:19,593
Twelve years in a blink isn't bad, pal.
A couple more of those, you'll be back home.

951
01:19:19,668 --> 01:19:22,865
If I leap forward again.
What if I leap back?

952
01:19:22,938 --> 01:19:24,997
That is always possible.

953
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:27,907
In other words, I could be
bouncing around in time forever?

954
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:30,968
No. Nobody lives forever.

955
01:19:34,716 --> 01:19:38,447
What does Ziggy say I have to put right
to leap this time? He isn't saying.

956
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,885
What?
He's depressed.

957
01:19:39,955 --> 01:19:42,321
He's a computer.
He's got a big ego.

958
01:19:42,391 --> 01:19:47,727
I think he knows what you have to do. He's
just afraid to print it out in case he's wrong.

959
01:19:47,796 --> 01:19:50,196
Who created this Ziggy?

960
01:19:53,769 --> 01:19:59,674
You. Quantum Leap
is your project, Sam.

961
01:19:59,741 --> 01:20:02,175
You're the genius behind it.

962
01:20:02,244 --> 01:20:05,907
At least you were before
your brain got magna-foozled.

963
01:20:05,981 --> 01:20:11,385
No, no. See, I'm a medical doctor.
I found that much out.

964
01:20:11,453 --> 01:20:13,353
You hold six doctorates, Sam.

965
01:20:13,422 --> 01:20:17,324
Medicine is just one of them.
Your special gift was quantum physics.

966
01:20:17,392 --> 01:20:20,054
Time magazine even
called you the next Einstein.

967
01:20:20,129 --> 01:20:22,324
The truth is...

968
01:20:22,397 --> 01:20:27,266
if there's one guy who could
figure out how to bring you back...

969
01:20:27,336 --> 01:20:29,270
it's you.

970
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:37,307
And I can't even
remember my name.

971
01:20:42,584 --> 01:20:47,044
It's Beckett.

972
01:20:51,426 --> 01:20:53,360
Sam Beckett.

973
01:21:10,812 --> 01:21:13,747
Jackson hits a towering smash...

974
01:21:13,815 --> 01:21:17,273
over the Shneck and Shneck billboard
in center field.!

975
01:21:17,352 --> 01:21:21,789
And the Bombers have pulled
within a run. Ooo-wee.!

976
01:21:27,196 --> 01:21:29,562
Long distance.

977
01:21:29,631 --> 01:21:31,565
Long distance?

978
01:21:31,633 --> 01:21:35,262
Yes, I'd like to call
a John Beckett...

979
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:38,500
in Elk Ridge, Indiana.

980
01:21:38,574 --> 01:21:40,974
And I-I-I don't have the number.

981
01:21:41,043 --> 01:21:43,102
John Beckett?

982
01:21:43,178 --> 01:21:46,545
Yes, ma'am. Beckett.
One moment, please.

983
01:21:53,889 --> 01:21:55,880
Hello?

984
01:21:58,994 --> 01:22:00,723
Dad?

985
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:06,632
What? Who is this?
Hello? Hello?

986
01:22:06,702 --> 01:22:09,603
Look, whoever this is,
I got no time for tomfoolery.

987
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:11,332
Please, don't hang up.

988
01:22:11,406 --> 01:22:13,397
Who is this?

989
01:22:15,344 --> 01:22:18,780
I- I'm a Beckett.

990
01:22:18,847 --> 01:22:22,305
My father and your father
are related.

991
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:24,375
How?

992
01:22:25,587 --> 01:22:30,115
Uh, they're brothers.

993
01:22:30,192 --> 01:22:32,183
I'm John's son.

994
01:22:32,261 --> 01:22:36,789
John's son? My God, he moved to
Australia when I was just a kid.

995
01:22:36,865 --> 01:22:39,993
Huh! Listen to me telling you
what your father did.

996
01:22:40,068 --> 01:22:42,036
That's all right.

997
01:22:42,104 --> 01:22:46,097
What's your name?
Sam.

998
01:22:46,174 --> 01:22:49,666
Well, I'll be darned.
I've named my boy Sam.

999
01:22:49,745 --> 01:22:53,374
How about that?
You don't sound Australian, Sam.

1000
01:22:53,448 --> 01:22:56,576
Well, I-I-I travel a lot.

1001
01:23:00,455 --> 01:23:02,685
I don't believe it.!

1002
01:23:02,758 --> 01:23:05,727
Flash hit a stand-up double.

1003
01:23:07,562 --> 01:23:10,190
I don't want to disappoint
my dad, but I...

1004
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:13,530
I don't think I'm gonna be able to
make it home for Thanksgiving this year.

1005
01:23:13,602 --> 01:23:17,003
Well, I know he'll understand.
I hope so.

1006
01:23:17,072 --> 01:23:20,166
It doesn't mean I don't love him.
I do, and I miss him a lot too,

1007
01:23:20,242 --> 01:23:22,233
even...

1008
01:23:24,446 --> 01:23:27,040
even if I never...
I never told him.

1009
01:23:27,115 --> 01:23:29,345
He knows.
You think so?

1010
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:33,514
Well, a boy can't feel about his dad
the way you do without his knowing it.

1011
01:23:36,091 --> 01:23:37,956
Maybe.

1012
01:23:38,026 --> 01:23:42,463
But when I don't show for Thanksgiving,
it's-it's gonna hurt him.

1013
01:23:42,531 --> 01:23:46,831
Sam, it's nice to have
the children home for the holidays,

1014
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:50,235
but sometimes
it can't happen.

1015
01:23:50,305 --> 01:23:53,274
You're a young man trying to
make your mark in the world, and...

1016
01:23:53,342 --> 01:23:55,529
how you go about doing
that's a lot more important

1017
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,370
to your father than
showing up for turkey.

1018
01:23:58,447 --> 01:24:00,574
At least
it would be for me.

1019
01:24:03,785 --> 01:24:06,948
Coming from you, that means...
that means a lot.

1020
01:24:07,022 --> 01:24:09,923
Now you can't make it
to Australia for the holidays,

1021
01:24:09,991 --> 01:24:13,324
but... we're a lot closer.

1022
01:24:13,395 --> 01:24:16,057
Why don't you come up here?
We got plenty of room,

1023
01:24:16,131 --> 01:24:21,091
and Mom's pumpkin pie has taken a blue ribbon
at the Elk Ridge County Fair for ten years.

1024
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:26,233
Well, I don't know
if I'll be able to, but I'm...

1025
01:24:26,308 --> 01:24:28,276
I'm sure gonna try.

1026
01:24:28,343 --> 01:24:31,608
Well, it doesn't have to be
Thanksgiving either.

1027
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,649
You wanna drop by here
anytime, you're welcome.

1028
01:24:37,252 --> 01:24:39,243
I'll remember that.

1029
01:24:43,692 --> 01:24:46,456
Good-bye.

1030
01:24:46,528 --> 01:24:48,519
I love you, Dad.

1031
01:25:04,613 --> 01:25:07,138
Hey, Dad, that calf
is gonna drop any second.

1032
01:25:07,215 --> 01:25:10,048
I'll get my sweater, Sam.

1033
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:13,679
I just talked to
my Uncle John's son from Australia.

1034
01:25:13,755 --> 01:25:15,723
He may come for the holidays.

1035
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:17,850
Can he milk cows?

1036
01:25:19,594 --> 01:25:21,528
Come on.

1037
01:25:40,882 --> 01:25:42,975
Thank you.

1038
01:25:59,835 --> 01:26:02,895
You know, maybe this quantum leaping...

1039
01:26:02,971 --> 01:26:05,098
isn't such a bad deal after all.

1040
01:26:05,173 --> 01:26:07,107
Getting a second chance
to put things right,

1041
01:26:07,175 --> 01:26:11,373
to make the world a better place.

1042
01:26:11,446 --> 01:26:14,279
Who knows what I can accomplish
before I'm done.

1043
01:26:29,865 --> 01:26:31,856
Thanks, Al.

1044
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:38,606
Go fly out.

1045
01:26:38,673 --> 01:26:41,801
I don't know, Al.
Maybe I'm here to win this one.

1046
01:26:45,514 --> 01:26:50,417
The tying run is on second, and the
potential winning run is coming up to bat!

1047
01:26:50,485 --> 01:26:56,446
Hey, Fox!
Tim, this is my last year too,

1048
01:26:56,525 --> 01:27:01,258
and, uh, I don't want
to end it in the cellar.

1049
01:27:12,707 --> 01:27:15,267
Go, Foxy! Go, Foxy!

1050
01:27:15,343 --> 01:27:19,575
Foxy! Foxy! Foxy!

1051
01:27:19,648 --> 01:27:22,208
Give me one with
a four-bagger in it, son.

1052
01:27:25,987 --> 01:27:29,684
Go on, Foxy.

1053
01:27:29,758 --> 01:27:32,591
Are you serious, Sam?

1054
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:35,391
You notice who that kid kind of
looks like out there? Yeah.

1055
01:27:35,463 --> 01:27:38,762
Yeah? Yeah?
You're gonna fly to center.

1056
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:42,792
Fox flied out to center.
I'm not Fox.

1057
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:46,102
Yeah, well, you're not Roy Hobbs either.

1058
01:27:52,347 --> 01:27:55,111
Fox, representing the winning run,
steps to the plate.

1059
01:27:55,183 --> 01:28:00,416
A switch-hitter, Fox has 28 home runs
this year, 12 of them batting left-handed.

1060
01:28:04,526 --> 01:28:09,190
Be patient in there now!
Be patient!

1061
01:28:23,278 --> 01:28:26,338
Strike one!

1062
01:28:26,414 --> 01:28:29,906
Well, now, at least there's someone
around here who can follow orders.

1063
01:28:42,897 --> 01:28:45,491
Strike two!

1064
01:28:51,072 --> 01:28:54,940
That last one had to be
over 100 miles an hour.

1065
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:57,945
I'll get the next one.
Did you ask for time?

1066
01:28:58,013 --> 01:29:00,447
No. Play ball.
All right. Let's go.

1067
01:29:00,515 --> 01:29:02,278
"When it comes to that
final out in life,

1068
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:06,548
"whether you pop out,
ground out or fly out, remember.

1069
01:29:06,621 --> 01:29:10,990
Shneck and Shneck will always
be there to bring you home. "

1070
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:13,960
Fox steps back into the box.
He digs in.

1071
01:29:14,029 --> 01:29:19,023
Behind 0 and 2 in the count, he looks
determined not to let another pitch go by.

1072
01:29:58,673 --> 01:30:00,971
Strike three.!

1073
01:31:45,535 --> 01:31:48,535
Subtitles: Thor
