We are at the doorstep

Soon we will be greeted

and by the cheers
of our forefathers

for all eternity!

13

I thought it was 100.

What's that?

they promised me 100.

what's the difference?

If they're telling you one thing
and they're telling me another,

maybe they don't know
for sure.

Maybe the exact number
of virgins is not precise.

I can live with that.

but what if it's 10?

Well...

25
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:15,307
What if it's 10, but we have
to split them between us?

26
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,042
Then you'll have
five more virgins

27
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,677
than you have right now,
right?

28

We're talking
about eternity here!

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,282
How long will five virgins
last you -- maybe a month?

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,984
They're not going to be virgins
for long, right?

you feel better

What are you going to do?

40
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,745
Anyway, look,
Nabi has a question.

41
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,746
Will you talk to him?

that Brother Richard here

What's the problem?

I tried to explain,
of course,

364
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,666
that with our continued expectation
of the end of the world,

365

it's difficult
to justify contributing

00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,178
Leave the welfare check
on the counter.

00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,713
Oh, yeah.

653
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,247
There. Oh, yeah.

Oh!

655
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:29,588
Give it to me, you stud.

Yes.

Yes!

659
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,365
Get me a large bottle
of cooking oil.

660
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,234
The extra-virgin kind!

Oh!

00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:54,413
Please, Uncle Dave, please,
just a few hundred bucks,

00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,750
just -- just enough to get me
out of this fuckhole town

for the rest
of my life, please?

Hey, sport.

Last chance.
Come on.

00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,556
Help me out with a few bucks.

I don't have anything.

Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to, huh?

00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,866
What, do you think I'm stupid
or something, huh?

674
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:17,403
Listen, you're not gonna help me
out, I'll help out myself.

Open up the wallet.

No.

Hey, bro?

Hey, while I got you,
I got to ask you --

683
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:36,121
What do you think of those --
those mileage rewards programs?

684
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:38,691
What's the matter with you? Let go.
- No!

685
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:41,026
You know, I thought you could
use those miles anytime

686
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:42,461
To get tickets, right?

687
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:45,631
But, you know, I tried, and
you can't use them at Christmas.

688
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:47,766
Last chance.
- No.

00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,335

It's like at every holiday
it's blacked out.

Like, anytime you want to use the
fucking thing, it's blacked out.

DAVE:
That's bullshit, isn't it?

- Yeah?

But you know what?

of strength

against the great Satan
of the West.

706
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:30,743
They believe we are weakened,

707
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,211
but in only a few days,

708
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:35,814
we will strike a blow against
America so swift and terrible

709
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:39,351
that the evil ones will collapse
once and for all.

We are asking those
of the true faith

00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:43,956
to wait, pray,

712

and praise Allah when
the glorious slaughter begins.

713

Just wonderful!

They're not listening anymore,

about Allah and glory.

Nobody wants to die anymore
unless they get virgins.

But no one has to die
this time.

to be like that?

of Krotchy dolls.

Krotchy dolls?
- Yeah.

00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:38,604
Yeah.

Biggest show on TV, number one.

00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,642
Oh, and the guy
who does the voice for it --

764
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,044
he's some big
international star, right?

00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:46,412
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

All that matters

767
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,549
is everybody wants one
of those dolls, right?

768
00:30:50,617 --> 00:30:53,118
But, sadly...

769
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:57,189
the Chinese tanker
bringing them over here sank.

770
00:30:57,257 --> 00:31:01,026
They were able to save
about 100,000 dolls.

771
00:31:01,094 --> 00:31:03,162
Unfortunately, none of the crew
was rescued.

772
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:06,865
So, what,
there's not enough dolls?

773
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,033
Check this out, man.

774

00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,984
And 2,000 times $4,000
times $4,000 is, uh...

780
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:26,985
is 8, uh...

781
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,921
that's like --
no, it's 800 --

00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,756
no, it's 8--
well, you move --

783
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:33,058
well, if it's three zeros h--

784
00:31:33,126 --> 00:31:34,326
you move the decimal back.

785
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,595
I don't think -- no, well, wait.
- Or...

786
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:37,896
It's a fucking lot of money!

787
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:39,064
Oh, it's an ass-load
of money.

788
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:40,866
Dude, a couple of asses.

789
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:43,202
Yeah.

790
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,004
Okay.

791
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,006
Okay.

792
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:48,874
So, what do you want out of me?

793
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:53,245
Come up with the plan.

794
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:56,315
'Cause if you remember
the whole flag-stealing thing,

795
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:57,649
that was my plan.

796
00:31:57,717 --> 00:31:59,385
That sucked.

797
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:01,553
It had
certain structural flaws.

798
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:03,989
Yeah. Yeah.

799
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:05,024
Okay.

800
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,926
Okay. Okay.

801
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:10,162
What we got to do
is we got to --

802
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,431
we got to go to little Germany...
- Yeah.

803
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,366
...And we got to break in there,

804
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,902
and we got to, uh,
get the dolls,

805
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,837
and we got to -- we got
to bring them back here.

806
00:32:18,905 --> 00:32:20,706
So, we're gonna need
some sort of a, uh...

807
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:21,707
truck.

808
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,509
Truck.
A truck would be good.

809
00:32:23,576 --> 00:32:26,412
Uh, one they can't trace back to us.
- Right.

810
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,084
Aha.

811
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Huh?

812
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:35,721
Yeah.

813
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:36,955

Get out of the way!

1145
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:28,300
Ohh!

1146
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:29,768
Oh! My shit!

1147
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:31,103
I'm so sorry!

1148
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:33,038
What are you doing with my shit?
- I'm a huge fan.

1149
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:35,107
Let me give you a hand with that.
- Leave it alone.

1150
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:37,142
I had no idea you be c--

1151
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,478
A dildo on a stick? That's crazy!
- That's mine.

[ laughs ]

1153
00:49:41,214 --> 00:49:42,886
Let me see if I can help
you get everything in!

1154
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:43,582
What are you doing?

1155
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:47,252
Jesus!

1156
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,821
What the fuck?!

1157
00:49:48,888 --> 00:49:51,190
God damn!

1158
00:49:51,257 --> 00:49:52,691
What --

1159
00:49:52,759 --> 00:49:55,794

I'm in my fucking suitcase.

Richard, what the fuck?

1162
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:01,433
It's a present.

1163
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:04,436
Hey! Assholes!

1164
00:50:09,342 --> 00:50:12,011
Uh...

1165
00:50:12,078 --> 00:50:13,779
Coffee shop.

1166
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,280
Lattes, no foam.

1167
00:50:15,348 --> 00:50:18,217
Yeah.

1168
00:50:18,284 --> 00:50:19,952
Uh, I got to go.

00:50:28,361 --> 00:50:29,762
Why did you bring him?

1172
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:31,497
Mind your own business
and get us out of here!

1173
00:50:31,564 --> 00:50:33,599
Shut up, you big crybaby.

GREG:
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1175
00:50:36,503 --> 00:50:37,603
Hey!

1176
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:40,105
Move, move, move, move, move.
Go, go, go.

1178
00:50:44,144 --> 00:50:45,544
Let's go, baby.

[ siren wailing ]

1180
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,948
Where is...the damn key?

1181
00:50:50,016 --> 00:50:51,884
You don't have the keys?

1182
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:53,752
I thought you had the keys.

1183
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:03,195
It's like
when you were a kid.

1184
00:51:03,263 --> 00:51:05,297
Sometimes it helps to retrace your steps.
- Oh.

1185
00:51:05,365 --> 00:51:06,432
Mohammed.

1186
00:51:06,499 --> 00:51:09,401
[ siren wailing ]
You're under arrest!

1187
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:11,470
You killed Harry!

1188
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:13,972
Start shooting, John.
Do something. Shit!

[ gunshots ]

1190
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:17,476
Harry wasn't hurting nobody.

1191
00:51:18,812 --> 00:51:19,945
What the fuck am I gonna do

1192
00:51:20,013 --> 00:51:21,680
with all those damn diapers
I bought him?

RICHARD: Good God!

1195
00:51:24,217 --> 00:51:27,086
You're stepping
on my thing! Oh!

1196
00:51:27,153 --> 00:51:28,487
Allah be praised.

1197
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:32,524
Now you will give your lives
to avenge this outrage.

1198
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:35,527
Or we could just kill
the other guys.

1199
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:36,528
Yeah!

1200

[ siren wailing,
tire screeching ]

1203
00:51:52,846 --> 00:51:54,980
Jesus Christ,
can you control this thing?

1204
00:51:55,048 --> 00:51:56,348
Yes!

1205
00:51:57,784 --> 00:52:00,686
WOMAN:
Watch where you're going!

[ chuckles ]

1210
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:10,896
It's the moo cow
from the welfare office.

1211
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:12,531
"sorry, we're closed."

1212
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:13,999
Bitch!

1213
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:18,037
What was that?

1214
00:52:18,104 --> 00:52:19,938
[ sighs ]

1215
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:24,209
Oh.

1216
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:27,780
I thought we had a flat,
but we just ran over some girl.

1217
00:52:27,847 --> 00:52:30,582
Whew! Thank god.

1218
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,384
Got a body on maple.

1219
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:35,621
WOMAN: Tag 22,
please repeat your location.

1220
00:52:35,689 --> 00:52:38,057
Maple, like the syrup.

1221
00:52:38,124 --> 00:52:40,793
Oh, this is
fucking fantastic.

1222
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,829
Oh, my God,
these kids are heavy!

1223
00:52:43,897 --> 00:52:46,465
Okay.
All right.

1224
00:52:46,533 --> 00:52:48,567
Gary -- wait.

1225
00:52:48,635 --> 00:52:49,835
Just wait.
Wait.

1226
00:52:49,903 --> 00:52:51,904
Oh, yeah.

1227
00:52:51,971 --> 00:52:52,905
Okay.

1228
00:52:52,972 --> 00:52:54,673
Roll it, Gary.

1229
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:56,475
Make me a star.

MAN:
[ crying ] Oh, my god.

1231
00:52:58,211 --> 00:53:00,312
This is Gayle Ravenson

00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,082
reporting live
from Little Germany theme park,

1233
00:53:03,149 --> 00:53:04,450
on what will forevermore

1234
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:07,753
be known as the place
where the laughter died.

1235
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:10,189
Celebrity icon Verne Troyer

1236
00:53:10,256 --> 00:53:13,192
is currently missing
or presumed dead.

1237
00:53:13,259 --> 00:53:15,794
The coward responsible
for this massacre

1238
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:19,298
has been described as
a rodent-like man with red hair

1239
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:21,333
and wearing
a "peace" T-shirt.

1240
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:23,869
Back to you, Bob.

1241
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:25,304
Oh, that's right.

1242
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:27,272
You're dead.

1243
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,708
These kids
are starting to smell.

1244
00:53:31,578 --> 00:53:35,047
I can't believe
I took this fucking job.

1245
00:53:35,115 --> 00:53:36,715
Fucking bullshit.

1246
00:53:36,783 --> 00:53:39,318
God damn it.

1247
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,153
This helps.

1248
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:43,022
Definitely helps.

1249
00:53:51,664 --> 00:53:53,699
We need to get him
inside immediately,

1250
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:55,501
along with the merchandise!
- Yes.

1251
00:53:55,568 --> 00:53:57,803
Jesus titty-fuck,
they're already here.

1252
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:58,971
WOMAN:
Now what do we do?

1253
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:00,806
That was the safest place
in all of Paradise.

1254
00:54:00,874 --> 00:54:02,207
You guys don't have
like a bomb shelter

1255
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:03,809
or a basement or something,
you know,

1256
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:06,157
that the Taliban couldn't
have found themselves, right?

1257
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:06,645
No, we don't.

1258
00:54:06,713 --> 00:54:07,713
We do.
- What?

1259
00:54:07,781 --> 00:54:08,914
We do.

1260
00:54:08,982 --> 00:54:10,883
There's
a massive underground shelter

1261
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,818
beneath the main compound.

1262
00:54:12,886 --> 00:54:14,119
It's perfect.

1263
00:54:14,187 --> 00:54:15,888
TROYER: You know
what would be perfect?

1264
00:54:15,955 --> 00:54:17,389
My foot up your ass.

1265
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:20,926
Who the fuck
are you people?

1266
00:54:20,994 --> 00:54:22,728
What the fuck
did you bring him for?

1267
00:54:22,796 --> 00:54:24,530
You'll see, Uncle Dave.

1268
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:26,298
Do you think we can sneak him
past the Taliban

1269
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:27,599
without them finding out?

1270
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:30,102
And where the fuck are
you gonna hide my Krotchy dolls?

1271
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,370
In plain sight.

1272
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:33,005
Somebody grab
the little guy.

1273
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:34,506
Come on, little guy.

1274
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:36,508
What the fuck's going on?

1275
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:37,509
WOMAN: Come on.

1276
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:38,777
WOMAN #2: Okay.
Shut up.

1277
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:40,112
WOMAN #3: Come on.

1278
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:43,716
Citizens of this great nation --

town...

1280
00:54:45,185 --> 00:54:51,023
be on the lookout for this
psychopathic, deranged killer,

1281
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:52,424
also known as...

1282

...Postal Dude.

1284
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:57,863
That's the best
we could come up -- Postal Dude.

1285
00:54:57,931 --> 00:55:00,099
He's wanted in conjunction
with the kidnapping,

1286
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:02,034
the shooting
at the welfare office...

1287
00:55:02,102 --> 00:55:04,103
the assassination
of candidate Wells...

1288
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,571
and killing a Chinese woman.

1289
00:55:05,638 --> 00:55:08,907
He killed
a poor, innocent Chinese lady.

1290
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:10,209
So, if you see him...

1291
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:11,944
You ever just have
one of those days?

1292
00:55:12,012 --> 00:55:13,779
Mm, no.

1293
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:14,947
Hey! Hey!

1294
00:55:15,015 --> 00:55:16,548
The Postal Dude!

[ indistinct shouting ]

1298
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:22,554
Uh, I don't think that's him.

1299
00:55:22,622 --> 00:55:25,457
See how his hair flows,
though?

1300
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:27,793
This guy
looks more like Jesus.

Shit. Shit.

1304
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,067
Shit, shit, shit.

1305
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:37,236
Let's go!

1306
00:55:37,303 --> 00:55:38,704
Thank you!

1307
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:41,974
Get him!
Come on!

So, to make a long story short,

1470
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:56,375
the Taliban wanted
to get ahold of the flu,

1471
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:58,944
and ma-na na-na na-na na-na na,
and they were gonna spread it.

1472
01:02:59,012 --> 01:03:01,213
Whatever.
I mean, we stopped them, right?

1473
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:02,348
We're good.

1474
01:03:02,415 --> 01:03:03,782
Exactly!

1475
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,017
We stopped them...

1476
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:07,019
so that we could do it
our own way.

1477
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:08,454
What?

1478
01:03:08,521 --> 01:03:12,424
See, they only wanted to spread
it in the United States,

1479
01:03:12,492 --> 01:03:16,295
but in order to fulfill
the prophecy in Dave's bible,

1480
01:03:16,363 --> 01:03:20,099
We must wipe out
the entire planet.

1481
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:22,101
He's fucking nuts.

1482
01:03:22,168 --> 01:03:25,771
Which brings us to you,
Mr. Verne Troyer!

1483
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:29,274
If he wrote anything about me
in that bible,

1484
01:03:29,342 --> 01:03:31,076
we're gonna have
some serious problems.

1485
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:36,248
"and you shall know when the
final day of reckoning begins

1486
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,250
"because on that day,

1487
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:40,986
"a tiny entertainer

1488
01:03:41,054 --> 01:03:44,423
will be raped
by 1,000 monkeys!"

1489
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,925
That's it.
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

1490
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:48,127
I'm sorry, little --

1491
01:03:48,194 --> 01:03:49,161
Ohh!

1492
01:03:49,229 --> 01:03:50,262
Ohh!

1493
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,598
Enough! Enough! Enough!

1494
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:56,068
Stop him!
We must do as god commands!

1495
01:03:56,136 --> 01:03:57,836
God damn it.

1496
01:03:57,904 --> 01:04:00,639
Bring on the monkeys!

1497
01:04:02,909 --> 01:04:05,277
Oh, not the monkeys.

1498
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:07,613
[ chattering ]

1499
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:09,348
Where'd you get
so many monkeys?

1500
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:10,482
I don't fucking know.

1501
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,984
I got nothing to do
with this shit.

1502
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:14,720
Oh.

1503
01:04:14,788 --> 01:04:16,021
Oh, shit.

1504
01:04:16,089 --> 01:04:17,623
Ohh!

1505
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:20,993
[ speaks indistinctly ]

1506

Don't fuck the pants up, please.
[ fabric tears ]

1507
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:29,134
All in all, this has really
not been a very pleasant day.

1508
01:04:29,202 --> 01:04:30,469
Yeah.
- But...

1509
01:04:34,407 --> 01:04:37,810
Unfortunately, the desperate
nature of our situation

1510
01:04:37,877 --> 01:04:40,212
suggests that we may
need another of us

1511
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,883
to embrace martyrdom as we bring
our fight to the Infidels.

1512
01:04:44,951 --> 01:04:46,051
Now...

1513
01:04:49,489 --> 01:04:52,291
How about Abdul?
KROTCHY: Hey, let's go do some drugs.

1514
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:53,525
[ whimpering ]

1515
01:04:53,593 --> 01:04:57,229
Oh, that is a great idea,
a great idea -- genius!

1516
01:04:57,297 --> 01:05:01,000
Of course,
one must agree willingly.

1517
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:03,569
Now, Abdul...

1518
01:05:03,636 --> 01:05:07,806
If you don't want to be blown
into a tiny million pieces,

1519
01:05:07,874 --> 01:05:11,543
raise your hand, hop on
one foot, and sing "Free Bird."

1520
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:14,046
[ whimpers ]

1521
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:17,349
Abdul it is.

1522
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:21,353
Now, if we just had Osama.

1523
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:24,890
Does anybody know
where the fuck he is?!

1524
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:30,829
So, you can see that just
by changing the words you use,

1525
01:05:30,897 --> 01:05:34,199
you can motivate your employees
in all new ways.

1526
01:05:34,267 --> 01:05:38,871
If you master my 117 steps
to dominating your employees,

1527
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:41,006
I personally guarantee
you will have a team

1528
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:45,744
of little killer bees ready
to live or die at your command.

1529
01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:49,281
You can make them work
for 72 hours straight at a time,

1530
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:52,084
especially if you put
crystal meth in the water.

1531
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:55,087
Now, some of you may be asking,
"isn't crystal meth illegal?"

1532
01:05:55,155 --> 01:05:56,655
Technically, yes,

1533
01:05:56,723 --> 01:05:59,825
but the U.S. Air force uses it
to fuel their pilots

1534
01:05:59,893 --> 01:06:01,960
when they're on night missions
over Afghanistan.

1535
01:06:02,028 --> 01:06:05,831
So it can't be that illegal
if the U.S. Air force uses it.

1536
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:10,135
So...what now?

1537
01:06:10,203 --> 01:06:12,471
So, you're
just gonna shoot us?

1538
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:16,308
Yeah, you know,
I'm really sorry, man.

1539
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:18,911
I mean, obviously, this is
some sort of misunderstanding,

1540
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:20,546
But you can see

1541
01:06:20,613 --> 01:06:23,816
where I kind of have to go
with it at this point. Hmm?

1542
01:06:23,883 --> 01:06:26,552
I mean, you're my nephew,
but these are my people.

1543
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:28,987
Got to lead them
to the Promised Land.

1544
01:06:29,055 --> 01:06:30,389
You're a douche.

1545
01:06:30,457 --> 01:06:33,092
Not.
- Yeah.

1546
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:36,829
Actually, the bible
doesn't say to kill you.

1547
01:06:40,433 --> 01:06:42,968
What the fuck, Richie?

1548
01:06:43,036 --> 01:06:44,103
Come on, what?

1549
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,704
I'm -- I'm god on earth,
remember?

1550
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:47,072
Read your fucking bible.

1551
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:50,042
When you read
between the lines,

1552
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:53,612
it's remarkable
how the meanings change.

1553
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,447
Now, the way I read it

1554
01:06:55,515 --> 01:06:59,952
was god chose you as a pawn
to get this movement going.

1555
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:03,689
But now it's time for someone
else to take charge...

1556
01:07:03,757 --> 01:07:05,424

I had no clue, man,
but this explains a lot.

to love myself for who I am.
