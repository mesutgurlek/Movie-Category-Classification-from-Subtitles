1
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:46,290
We can't come to the phone rightnow.
Please leave a message.

2
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:52,033
Hi, it's Jack. We're going
to leave London as planned.

3
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:55,639
We'll take a cab from the airport
so don'tpick us up.

4
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:02,072
Eight! One, two, three ...

5
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:08,645
You already own that.
You own everything.

6
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:15,784
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
Feed them if they're still alive.

7
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,759
Mom can make my move.

8
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:24,801
lf they're not, go to the store
and find a couple the same size.

9
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,667
We'll see you soon. Bye.

10
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,503
What's happening?

11
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:36,671
- Yes!
- No! Another hotel?

12
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:43,745
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me £1 ,100.

13
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:48,587
l haven't got it. l'm out.
l want to go to sleep.

14
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,568
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?

15
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,301
Will these do?

16
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,345
Yeah, bring them in.

17
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,120
My wife ... l guess.

18
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:40,311
Candles, champagne ...

19
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:46,713
- l'm sor´ry l didn't think of this.
- lt's okay, only one of us had to.

20
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,985
ls she asleep?

21
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,563
- What about your speech?
- l'll wing it.

22
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,264
Are you sure?

23
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:21,982
We have all watched in awe at
the events taking place in Moscow.

24
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,954
And at the enormous changes
resulting from these events.

25
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,596
ln this volatile climate,
we can only speculate -

26
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,597
- on the future
of Soviet Fleet development.

27
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:40,637
l would like to thank the Royal Navy
for inviting me here today.

28
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:51,600
He's impressed, but he can't show it.
He's a professional soldier.

29
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,871
Come on, we've got to meet Daddy.

30
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,306
l'm impressed.

31
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,958
- Can you find it?
- Yeah, we're here.

32
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:13,189
When we get to this street,
we turn left ... no, right.

33
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,336
Are you sure?
Okay, we're going to turn right.

34
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:35,078
Mind yourself, Paddyboy.
Move sure and fast.

35
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,884
- You've told me that.
- l'm telling you again.

36
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,994
This won't be like anything
you've done before, little brother.

37
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,030
Targetleaving the palace now.

38
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,101
Stay awake, lads. Here they come.

39
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,610
There's Daddy.

40
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,683
Go!

41
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,628
Get down!

42
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,297
Get down!

43
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,079
Get down. Keep her down.

44
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,125
Get out of the car! Get out!

45
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,392
Open the fucking door!

46
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,970
Open it or l'll blow you up.

47
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,678
Come on, let's go.

48
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,516
Go! Go!

49
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,897
Paddy?.

50
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,675
Stop! Army! Drop it!

51
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,502
What about the boy?.

52
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,475
He's had it.

53
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,624
lt's all right, sweetie. Stay here.

54
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,333
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband. l'm a doctor.

55
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:20,808
Jesus! What were you thinking of?

56
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,511
l'm going to set you down.

57
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:31,816
Stay with me, Jack. You hear me?

58
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,687
Jack ... Stay with me.

59
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:54,875
There's a feeling of outrage over
this attack on the Royal Family.

60
00:11:55,081 --> 00:12:00,610
No group has yet claimed credit,
but one is under strong scrutiny.

61
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,720
The lRA.

62
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:07,655
According to eyewitness accounts,
Lord William Holmes, -

63
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,321
- the MinisterforNorthern lreland,
along with his wife and son, -

64
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:18,595
- were saved by an American tourist,
John Patrick Ryan.

65
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:28,244
An author andprofessor at the
NavalAcademy in Maryland, -

66
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,473
- Ryan is
a former Marine Lieutenant.

67
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:38,886
He was wounded and is underguard
at an undisclosed London hospital.

68
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,458
Deborah Weston,
CNN News, London.

69
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,874
- l'm sor´ry.
- lt's all right.

70
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:08,247
You're alive. l forgive you.
otherwise ...

71
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,523
Hey, pumpkin.

72
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,533
l love you.

73
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,533
l love you, too.

74
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:40,144
Can you dignify their cowardice
with your silence? They left you.

75
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:47,155
They drove off without you.
What is it you think you owe them?

76
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,420
lf any of my mates
left me in your hands, -

77
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:57,262
- l'd feel no great sense
of loyalty. l'd kill them.

78
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,163
Who are they, Sean?

79
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,802
Where are they?.

80
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:13,508
The trip was unscheduled, but you
knew Lord Holmes would be there.

81
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:28,424
l can't help you
if you don't talk to me.

82
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:44,443
l'd tear your heart out
if l didn't know you'd enjoy it.

83
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,245
You Fenian bastard.

84
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,597
No, not in all eternity.
He'll not chirp a word.

85
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:04,963
Not Sean Miller. Not while
his brother's lying on a slab.

86
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,839
- Don't you believe it, Jimmy?.
- l don't believe the entire thing.

87
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:18,881
The Royal Family,
that only turns people against us.

88
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:31,455
This was totally unauthorised.
The brigade know you were behind it.

89
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:36,533
Fuck the lRA! All these years of war
and they've got us nowhere.

90
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:42,002
England is still a monarchy,
and that is where we must strike.

91
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:46,041
The Royals and the ruling class.

92
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:53,041
You're either with us
or you're against us.

93
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:59,719
- Make up your mind.
- l'm with you.

94
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,956
Good, that's all l wanted to hear.

95
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,706
l'll leave you to it.

96
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:22,071
Kevin. Charlie's going to drop by
to straighten things out.

97
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:28,015
Be smart. Talk to him
and hold your temper.

98
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,715
l promise. Thanks, Jimmy.

99
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,503
Kevin!

100
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,573
Kevin, it's Charlie.

101
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,442
That's me holding my temper.

102
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:10,110
- Damn! l forgot.
- What?

103
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,977
Where's my bag?

104
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,621
You're not going to make me wear
a rubber?.

105
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:21,623
- The church says it's a sin, darling.
- So's this, darling.

106
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:02,490
What can you tell me about this guy?.

107
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:08,333
He's a nice boy. Sean Miller.
He shot a priest in Der´ry.

108
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,443
lt was during confession. He thought
he was informing for the British.

109
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:17,604
lt's not in Mr Ryan's best
interests, nor the prosecution's, -

110
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:21,843
- to discuss matters
not directly at hand.

111
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:28,892
lf you can confirm for me that you
disarmed that man in the square, -

112
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,756
- we'll be through.

113
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:37,425
- l can.
- Do you have anything to add?

114
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:42,335
Yes. The man l killed
was Miller's ... brother.

115
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:50,004
Patrick ... not even 1 7. He was
recruited by Sean into the lRA.

116
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:54,117
T´ry to preserve the clarity
of your eventual testimony.

117
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,050
- l read it in a newspaper.
- Refrain from reading newspapers.

118
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,819
Not even Doonesbury?.

119
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,930
Do you have anything to add?

120
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,793
No.

121
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,989
My name's Geoffrey Watkins.
Private secreta´ry to Lord Holmes.

122
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,996
lt's a pleasure to meet you.
This is my wife, Catherine.

123
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,566
Dr Ryan, how is your patient?

124
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,900
Just fine, we're looking forward
to going home, though.

125
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:52,702
- May l introduce his lordship?
- Hello.

126
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,870
lt's my great honour
to finally meet you.

127
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:02,645
l owe you a debt of gratitude
that l shall never be able to repay.

128
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,132
l'm delighted you're here
to share in the good news, Mrs Ryan.

129
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:27,768
Her Majesty has decided to invest
your husband with a knighthood.

130
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,949
My congratulations ... Sir.

131
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:36,245
Good luck today.

132
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,793
Sir Jack!

133
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,496
Lady Catherine!

134
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:57,835
lf l'd had time to think, l'd have
preferred to do something else.

135
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:03,811
You're saying you didn't have time,
so you didn't?

136
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:09,976
- Didn't what?
- You didn't think. lsn't that it?

137
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:18,755
No, you raced into a situation
of which you had no understanding -

138
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:23,901
- and attacked my client, who was
a pedestrian also hur´rying to help.

139
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:28,869
- Wearing a ski mask?.
- You shot another man in the chest.

140
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:33,568
- After they shot me.
- And felled a second victim.

141
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,805
l used that force
l deemed necessa´ry.

142
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:45,081
l should say so. l doubt ve´ry much
if anyone would disagree.

143
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:50,250
l didn't make this happen ...
He did.

144
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,728
There is one more question.

145
00:23:54,933 --> 00:24:00,929
Are you still in the paid service
of the ClA?

146
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,700
Remember you're under oath.

147
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,447
- No.
- l beg your pardon?

148
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,277
No!

149
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,010
That's all, thank you.

150
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,622
The witness may stand down.

151
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,660
Thank you.

152
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,927
Bloody proud of yourself,
aren't you?

153
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:35,596
You stuck your nose in, and
now you've killed my baby brother.

154
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,148
Hey, Daddy.

155
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:41,499
Wow, you guys have really grown.

156
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,093
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.

157
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,430
- Are you tired?
- No.

158
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:19,372
- l have no idea what time it is.
- You're telling me.

159
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:27,775
- Did l miss something?
- No ... but l did.

160
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:35,019
l'm pregnant.

161
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,320
Honey!

162
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,130
Can l watch some TV?
l'm not at all tired.

163
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,437
What?

164
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,806
Plates.

165
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,710
- Do l have any say in this?
- Sure, this is a family.

166
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,978
- Eve´ryone has a say.
- But my say is after the fact.

167
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:07,386
- Or am l wrong?
- No, you're right.

168
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:11,790
Michaela despises her little sister.

169
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:17,731
Well, it could be even worse.
lt could be a baby brother.

170
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,564
Oh no! Boys!

171
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,040
Jack.

172
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:30,647
Are you denying
that the lRA was behind this action?

173
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:35,946
When the lRA carry out a campaign,
they admit to it.

174
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,954
That's theirpolicy.
They'llproudlysay they did it.

175
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:45,095
Have the lRA admitted to this?
l mean, common sense, logic ...

176
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,925
Can l at least suggest some names?

177
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,260
Sure you can.

178
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,845
Good morning, Mr Cooley.

179
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,778
And to you. How's business?

180
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:45,650
Fine, thank you. l came upon this
first edition at an estate auction.

181
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,792
Can your man restore it?

182
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:53,025
- When would you want this by?.
- Soon.

183
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:01,629
The binder
may have some trouble with this.

184
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,308
ls that so?

185
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:08,001
l'll see what l can do.
He's not a miracle worker.

186
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:12,240
No, obviously he's not, Mr Cooley.

187
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:17,313
The best you can arrange then.

188
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,489
- Good day, Mr Cooley.
- Good day, madam.

189
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,441
Hello, Sean, do you mind
if l come along with you?

190
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:32,388
Although l disapprove
of the things you've done, -

191
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:37,500
- l can't quite bring myself
to condemn you.

192
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:46,775
l can't, because l understand
where the hatred comes from.

193
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,575
l more than understand it.

194
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:58,882
But the fact is, we're ve´ry near the
darkest hole in all of Great Britain, -

195
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,150
- and you still won't speak to me.

196
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,889
The bridge is up.
We'llbe here forfive minutes.

197
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,060
Understood.

198
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,907
Mobile three to Lymington ...

199
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,896
Open the door.
Open it or l'll kill him.

200
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,470
- They've got the bridge keeper.
- Open the door.

201
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:27,612
Should we wait until they kill him
and then open the door?.

202
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:38,587
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.

203
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,757
Get them out.

204
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,960
Lie down. Don't you fucking move.

205
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,732
Did you think we'd forget about you?

206
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:05,748
lnspector Robert Highland,
this is a friend of mine.

207
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:12,287
Tell me, what do they pay you
to turn against your own people?

208
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,088
Get on with it and be on your way.

209
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:20,856
Ve´ry well,
if that's the way you feel about it.

210
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,947
Come on, Cath.

211
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:24,358
- Have l got the tickets?
- They're on the fridge!

212
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:29,465
- Dad ...
- Honey, there's plenty of time.

213
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:05,159
- Hello, Admiral.
- Jack, you know Marty Cantor.

214
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,736
- How's the shoulder?.
- Not too bad.

215
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:16,375
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?

216
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,976
They were moving him to
Albany Prison on the lsle of Wight.

217
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:29,387
- We think he's left the count´ry.
- Let's deal in what we know.

218
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:33,291
We know he escaped in Kent,
near the Channel.

219
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:38,697
lf he's left the count´ry ...
Jack, are you listening?

220
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:42,339
The chances that he'd come here,
or would t´ry to, -

221
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,839
- are so remote
l have trouble even saying it.

222
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:50,343
Yet your first instinct
was to come out here and tell me.

223
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,978
Marty, excuse us a few minutes.

224
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:28,043
l've got a few more weeks
before school starts, -

225
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:32,052
- but l've got to prepare
a few lectures.

226
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:37,250
Come and look at what we've got.
You might turn up something.

227
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:41,591
You're asking me
if l want to come back.

228
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,767
Yep.

229
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:54,344
We'll t´ry and go next week.
Sor´ry.

230
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,938
Sean Miller escaped.

231
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:05,044
What does that mean?

232
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:09,420
They thought l might be concerned,
but l'm not.

233
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:14,655
The lRA's not going to follow me
over here. We talked about that.

234
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,959
They're gone, that's it.

235
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:22,401
They didn't ask you
to come back to ClA?

236
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:26,941
- l said no.
- Just like that.

237
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,505
l don't want to go back.

238
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:41,181
- l saw them coming and l just ...
- l know.

239
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:45,988
l can't go back to that life again,
you know?.

240
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:19,691
l bet your cell
was better than this.

241
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,025
At least you had
your own toilet bowl.

242
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:28,729
Cheer up, you've just been spared
a lifetime of hell on earth.

243
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:34,605
l don't feel like resting, laying in
the sun like a complacent tourist.

244
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:40,307
We've got to train like soldiers
and we can't do that in lreland.

245
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,009
lt's a waste of time.

246
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:47,418
There's a difference
between laying about and laying low.

247
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:54,827
Next time we'll post Lord Holmes
back to Whitehall in pieces, -

248
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:59,162
- if that's what it takes to free
eve´ry lrish political prisoner.

249
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,669
- That's not what l'm thinking of.
- l know that.

250
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:07,173
What Ryan did can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.

251
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,272
l can't.

252
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,952
How could something like this
have happened?

253
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:29,258
lnspector Highland picked the day
and the route, and still they knew.

254
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:33,836
- He had two children.
- Tragic.

255
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:40,602
SO-13 have narrowed it down to
31 people who had this knowledge.

256
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:44,178
Five of whom are now dead.

257
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,840
You should limit your appointments.

258
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:53,649
l will not have my itinera´ry
dictated to me by terrorists.

259
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,758
Whoever this traitor is,
they'd better pray l never find him.

260
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,263
We know you'll do your best, sir.

261
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:29,816
We don't know
ifwe're ever coming home

262
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:35,590
stand up, buckle up,
shuffle through the door

263
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,394
jump out and shout Marine Corps!

264
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:43,733
Egesta appealed to Athens
on what basis, on what grounds?

265
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:48,844
Mr Viederman?
A bad time for you?

266
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:54,074
They said they'd be grateful.

267
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,049
- Didn't they?.
- Yeah.

268
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,192
''Fight our battle and the world
will fear and respect you.''

269
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:07,854
- Athens already had respect.
- lt didn't matter.

270
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:12,161
- Pride, sir.
- That's the real battle.

271
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:17,033
- Attention on deck.
- Attention to orders.

272
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,766
l have a presentation to make.

273
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:26,849
For service above and beyond
the call of duty of a tourist, -

274
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:33,889
- we recognise John Patrick Ryan
with the order of the Purple Target.

275
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:37,322
We hope that he will duck
next time, -

276
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:42,556
- lest he become part of histo´ry
rather than a teacher of it.

277
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,008
- How old is he?
- Ten.

278
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:55,007
Plate-glass window?.

279
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:02,442
Here goes. Hi, guys.

280
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:12,262
We may have to bump my next
appointment. This might take time.

281
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:18,197
Yes, let's bump it.
Okay, let's do it.

282
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:23,669
You just waded on in
like John Wayne.

283
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:28,311
Why did you do it?
What were you thinking?

284
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:36,652
- l don't know. l wasn't thinking.
- You sound like my students.

285
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,725
lt pissed me off.

286
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:50,731
l couldn't just stand there
and watch them shoot those people.

287
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:55,338
lt was ... rage.

288
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,400
Pure rage.

289
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:07,943
- lt just made me mad.
- l hope you never get mad at me.

290
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,897
She's late, Sean.

291
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:56,756
She was at this dance,
and then this guy at the end ...

292
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:02,299
She's kind of cute, isn't she?

293
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:05,407
ls she?

294
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,916
Bye.

295
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:20,390
- Hi, Mommy.
- How are you?

296
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,422
Let's do it.

297
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,861
Damn!

298
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,116
Highway 50. West.

299
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,290
Goodbye, Doctor.

300
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,360
Dr Ryan! He's getting away.

301
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:50,565
Where's Sean Miller?.

302
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:11,157
Dr Catherine Ryan, please.

303
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,295
How long?

304
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:20,002
Come on!

305
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:51,593
This is Dr Ryan. l want the results
on the Thompson boy's retinal scan.

306
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:56,898
Cathy, get off the phone.

307
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:11,147
- Look, Mom.
- lt's beautiful.

308
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:16,418
l'm still holding.
l'd like to speak with Dr Sutton.

309
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:41,583
Operator, emergency breakthrough.
The number is 555-3464.

310
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:45,846
lt's a mobile phone, l know.
What do you mean l can't?

311
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,759
Faster!

312
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:18,110
- Dr Ryan, the scan is fine.
- Great, thank you.

313
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,791
Jesus!

314
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,905
Hello? Jack?.

315
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:43,546
Cath, something's happened.
ls Sally with you?

316
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,614
- ls everything all right?
- Fine.

317
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,018
There she is.

318
00:49:55,592 --> 00:50:00,393
Get to the nearest police station
as quick as you can.

319
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:04,089
- The police station?
- Get offthe highway.

320
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:11,402
Steady, mate.

321
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,709
- Where are you now?
- Rowe Boulevard.

322
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:20,315
There's a police station
at Houston Street.

323
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,044
- ls something wrong?
- No, everything's fine.

324
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,039
They're gone.

325
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:14,055
- Mr Ryan?
- Yeah.

326
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,230
Your wife's okay.
She sustained a concussion.

327
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,599
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's okay.

328
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,139
- And my daughter?.
- Let's sit down.

329
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,937
No, talk to me.

330
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,139
lt's going to be a while
before we know.

331
00:52:54,504 --> 00:53:00,875
- Where's Sally?.
- She's in the recove´ry room.

332
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:06,777
They're watching her.
We'll know in a few hours.

333
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:12,844
They had to remove her spleen.

334
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:16,423
She's in pretty bad shape.

335
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,930
l'm sor´ry.

336
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:13,079
Here you go. Are you okay?.

337
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:25,989
We go over to our reporter
with Paddy O'Neil.

338
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:33,068
l'm praying for the recovery ofthe
victims ofthis senseless attack.

339
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:41,541
Sinn Féin are outraged, as are most
lrishmen, at this heinous crime.

340
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:46,375
l want to share with Dr Ryan
our empathy and anguish, -

341
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,416
- at an appropriate time.

342
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:56,149
- Was funding for the lRA ...
- The lRA are notresponsible here.

343
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:02,059
- Theyhad nothing to do with it?
- No more questions.

344
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:11,403
- She's going to be okay.
- Thank you.

345
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:16,940
lt's all right. She's fine.

346
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:25,180
Mr Ryan?

347
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:29,722
l'd like to share with you
our deep regret ...

348
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:36,396
Mr Ryan ...

349
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:19,972
You know the deal. You are involved.
lt's not good process.

350
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:24,738
The victim of a crime
does not make the best analysis, -

351
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,145
- even if
you knew something about terrorism.

352
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:33,015
l have guys on it
who know about the lRA.

353
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:39,719
l'm not standing here with my hat
in my hand. l want back in.

354
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:44,059
Jack ...
Thank God about Sally.

355
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:47,100
Alice and l are so relieved.

356
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:51,330
- Have you managed any sleep?
- Not much, sir.

357
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,702
l'm interrupting something.

358
00:56:55,912 --> 00:57:01,441
You were telling Jack that we'd
be better off without him around.

359
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,381
Or something along those lines.

360
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,297
Marc Spiva. Jack Ryan.

361
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:22,437
Tony Ferro. Alex Winter.

362
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,268
- Rose ...
- You look better than l expected.

363
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:34,610
- lt's an illusion.
- lt'd have to be. Good to see you.

364
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:40,688
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night-table reading.

365
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:32,033
''Father killed by RUC ...
Belfast, 1979.''

366
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:45,653
Good morning, sir.
Could l see some identification?

367
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:15,241
- Did you see the game?
- Yeah, it was all right.

368
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:19,785
For that penalty,
he was outside the area.

369
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:06,701
- What the hell ..?
- Nobody move!

370
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,770
Get 'em up!

371
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:14,302
Good morning.

372
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,606
Kevin O'Donnell.
A long-time lRA strategist.

373
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,579
He saw Timothy Miller die in 1979.

374
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:26,414
He looked after Sean and Patrick.
lt's a recent photo.

375
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:31,959
lf we could find O'Donnell,
we'd find Miller, too.

376
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:35,528
- Are you with me, Jack?.
- l'm just thinking.

377
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:40,226
- What about the gun?
- lt wasn't registered.

378
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:43,735
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

379
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,807
Look ...

380
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:55,244
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip
about some bomb-making setup.

381
01:00:55,451 --> 01:01:01,117
They get the bad guys,
but who tipped them off?

382
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,892
Three lRA hitmen
found dead at a farmhouse.

383
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:13,091
That's British soldiers
getting out of hand.

384
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:17,966
No, look ... Brigade Commander
Jimmy O'Reardon.

385
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:23,510
Ends up dead in a cheap hotel.
A professional hit.

386
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:27,342
- Was that after the farmhouse?
- Same day.

387
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:32,010
- Same day.
- What are you coming to?

388
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:39,090
Jack! Where are you going?

389
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:44,232
l'm going to throw
some water on my face.

390
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,882
Excuse me ...

391
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:48,325
l think one of us
is in the wrong room.

392
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:51,022
lt's okay.

393
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:22,097
- Jack!
- Get down.

394
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:26,701
When the lRA carry out a campaign,
they admit to it.

395
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:29,371
Get down!

396
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:46,086
Who are we looking for here,
lRA terrorists?

397
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:51,659
Or some ultra-violent faction
of the lRA, fighting their own way.

398
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:57,822
O'Reardon checked into an hotel
with a woman with long hair.

399
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:00,696
Long red hair.

400
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:07,308
This is who we're looking for.
We find her, we'll find him.

401
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:07,698
l saw his wife and daughter die,
but she and Neddie blew it.

402
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,271
Ryan's still alive.

403
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:15,501
- They're not dead.
- What?

404
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:19,647
They survived it.
l can't say it any plainer.

405
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,781
- lt doesn't matter now.
- lt does matter.

406
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:42,096
Americans hold their breath
eve´ry time a little girl falls down.

407
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:46,207
You shot at one with a machine gun
on her way back from school.

408
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:51,176
We've started the war. The Brits are
tearing apart Belfast for the lRA.

409
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:56,841
Their American money, by denying the
hits, makes them look more guilty.

410
01:05:57,053 --> 01:06:02,252
The war is raging. When it's over,
we'll be the ones left standing.

411
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:07,828
l let you go for Paddyboy,
but that's it!

412
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:14,231
We've got work to do ...
and it's not in Ma´ryland.

413
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,267
Hello.

414
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:24,965
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?

415
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:31,272
You nearly lost them, didn't you?
lt's easy to get at them.

416
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:36,508
You should
look afteryour familybetter.

417
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:42,589
Are you there? l understand
your little girl's feeling better.

418
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:49,721
Losing herspleen willmake it
tough on her to fight offinfection.

419
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,924
You sick son of a bitch.

420
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:03,975
lt was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.

421
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:14,020
He'll never get close to us again.
All he can do is call up.

422
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:20,618
You get him, Jack.
l don't care what you have to do.

423
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,993
Just get him!

424
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,592
Can l buy you a drink?.

425
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,692
No ...

426
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:02,302
Let me buy you one.

427
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:08,434
Two whiskeys.

428
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:20,118
The lRA's not responsible
for all this, l know that.

429
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:24,918
Are you waiting for me to agree?
lt's what l've said all along.

430
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:29,996
You claim responsibility
for one thing, deny it for another.

431
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:33,225
Nobody believes you anymore.

432
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:37,269
l want to know where Sean Miller
and Kevin O'Donnell are.

433
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:43,843
Let me t´ry and understand this ...

434
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:49,484
You want me to sell out
my fellow lrishmen to you?

435
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,950
- You don't understand me at all.
- l think l do.

436
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:58,024
l don't care what they've done!

437
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:03,597
The day l sell out my own people,
l'll put a bullet through my head.

438
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:11,932
- That's it then.
- Yes, l'm not drinking with you.

439
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:15,008
Okay, l'll go home.

440
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:20,808
l'll call the Press and let them
film in my daughter's hospital room.

441
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:24,076
lt'll be on the evening news.

442
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:28,518
l don't care if it wasn't you,
and neither will anyone else.

443
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:33,752
You'll have so little gun money,
you'll all be out throwing rocks.

444
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:39,868
l will fucking destroy you!
l'll make it my mission in life.

445
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:47,870
Excuse me.

446
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,003
Well, lads, did you hear that?

447
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:21,976
- The satellite's coming.
- Let's go.

448
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:26,007
Come on!

449
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,921
Get inside!

450
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:45,227
SO-13 traced the guns
used in the Lord Holmes incident -

451
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:48,699
- to an arms dealer
that supplies Gaddafi.

452
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:54,672
Sean Miller was last seen in a
Zodiac heading out into the Channel.

453
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:58,313
l checked on the freighters
that were out there that day.

454
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:04,544
Syrian regist´ry. lnvolved
in the Middle East arms trade.

455
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:10,089
- Miller sailed to North Africa.
- Exactly.

456
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:17,130
Our planes photograph 182 camps
a day in North Africa.

457
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:23,761
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade,
Action Direct, Red Army Faction ...

458
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:27,339
But on the day
this ship docked in Benghazi, -

459
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:31,274
- there's activity
in only nine of these camps.

460
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:36,349
One is PLO, one Shining Path,
these seven we're not so sure about.

461
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:39,885
- Why?.
- Our satellites ...

462
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:46,551
The people in those camps probably
know our satellite schedules.

463
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:53,494
Marty, unless you authorise us
to retask those satellites, -

464
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,364
- so we can get a look in, -

465
01:12:56,572 --> 01:13:01,009
- we're never going to know
which camp they're at.

466
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:06,614
Do you know how big a deal
it is to retask those satellites?

467
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,841
Yeah.

468
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:24,823
Bring up camp 18 again.

469
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:33,464
Tighten on the camp here.

470
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:42,339
Let's look up here.
See what we can see.

471
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,894
Show me this grouping here.

472
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:12,010
That's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.

473
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:15,850
Let me see down here.

474
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:23,417
What's that? Tighten up on that.

475
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,864
Can you enhance that?

476
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,352
Tits.

477
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:20,213
The SAS could take out
any one of these camps.

478
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:25,512
Kill eve´rybody there,
and be gone before the echo fades.

479
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:29,384
Are you sure this is the same woman?

480
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,624
Keep at it then.

481
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,763
Son of a bitch.

482
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:12,566
Hi.

483
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:17,469
Read it again, Daddy.

484
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:32,783
''The sun did not shine,
it was too wet to play.''

485
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:37,448
''So we sat in the house
all that cold, wet day.''

486
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:51,963
''l sat there with Sally.
We sat there, we two.''

487
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:55,075
''l wish we had something to do.''

488
01:16:55,277 --> 01:17:00,044
''Too wet to go out.
Too cold to playball. ''

489
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:05,083
''So we satin the house
and did nothing at all. ''

490
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:10,350
''All we could do
was to sit, sit, sit. ''

491
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:15,326
''We did notlike it,
not one little bit. ''

492
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:19,827
''And then something went... bump. ''

493
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:06,337
Paddy O'Neil can sleep at night.
He probably enjoys the irony.

494
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:08,880
She's not lrish, she's English.

495
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:19,792
This is the girl you saw
in the jeep, in the blink of an eye?

496
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:23,453
- Yeah.
- What am l supposed to do?

497
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:27,066
Tell SO-13 you know who she is.
Give them her picture.

498
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:31,535
Ask them to look for her.
What do you mean, what do you do?

499
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:37,701
You walk into a bar, half of whose
customers want you dead.

500
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:44,250
You walk up to the lRA's bagman
and publicly threaten him.

501
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:49,049
You're not a field man.
You are an analyst. Analyse that!

502
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:54,718
l am not after yourjob. l'm after
the man who tried to kill my family.

503
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:59,594
Well then, think. lf you tell O'Neil
that you're looking for a girl, -

504
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:05,933
- and he gives you pictures of
a girl. Do you believe him?

505
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:12,712
l didn't tell him
l was looking for a girl.

506
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:45,636
Sarge, come and look at this.

507
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:03,794
l'm a bit of a bookworm, not that
you'd know it to look at me.

508
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:09,198
What's your passion then?
Mysteries? Spy novels?

509
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:14,398
- This is a rare book shop.
- Rare? Yes, so they are.

510
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:18,170
- Can you locate the problem?
- l already have.

511
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:22,373
The wiring in this place
dates from before the war.

512
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:26,748
lt's what we call
in the electrical business ... rare.

513
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:32,188
- l can fix it, but can you afford it?
- Just fix it.

514
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,533
- He's seen it, hasn't he?
- l don't know.

515
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:51,134
- He's got it.
- What do you make of this?

516
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:58,976
l ...
l have no idea!

517
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:01,519
Damn!

518
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:10,261
l have to go out for a few minutes
to deliver some books.

519
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:15,095
- Keep about your repairs.
- l'll be here all week.

520
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:32,307
He gave me the hat.
He said, ''This is for you, my dear.''

521
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,880
Damn!

522
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:51,999
Dinner at the White House
is no problem.

523
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:57,137
- What is the problem?
- We're running out of dates.

524
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:00,331
We could move that to there ...

525
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:06,378
Which would leave us the 14th.

526
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:10,483
Check with John Ryan
about a presentation -

527
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:14,212
- at our embassy in Washington
on the ...

528
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:17,721
... 14th.

529
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:24,788
Let's go over this again.
We start in Washington ...

530
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:34,105
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- l'm trying to reach Mr Titus.

531
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:38,769
- ls that extension 2691?
- No, this is 2619.

532
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,881
l'm terribly sor´ry.

533
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:55,555
- What are you doing up?
- l want to be there when she wakes.

534
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:59,564
l'll go with you
and take a cab back.

535
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:04,897
Hello ... Yes, just a minute.

536
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:10,840
- lt's for you, Sir John.
- Hello?

537
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:19,911
Mr Ryan is holding a celebration.
Would you care to join them?

538
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:23,284
- Where? At his house?
- Yes, sir.

539
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,895
Why not?

540
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:43,640
We shot this
eight days ago in Berlin.

541
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:47,713
One, two, three ...

542
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:53,183
Four Brits travelling with him.
Light arms.

543
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:58,485
- The heavy stuff is in the cars.
- He's German.

544
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:03,721
- ls this boring you, Sean?
- Six altogether.

545
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:10,303
- lt'll be the same in Washington.
- Holmes will always be protected.

546
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:14,532
Four days in Washington
and one day in New York ...

547
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:17,939
... shopping.

548
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:34,494
Yeah, two Caucasians.

549
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,961
Take a look at the one with the hat.

550
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:44,963
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn. A new arrival.

551
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:03,882
What do you think, same guy?.

552
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:11,230
The rare-book dealer, Dennis Cooley.
He's bald.

553
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:18,063
lt's possible there's a woman
in some of these camps.

554
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:23,210
But with her and Cooley
in the same place ...

555
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:28,508
... if that is Cooley, the odds
of coincidence are dropping fast.

556
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,809
But still,
there's no way l can be ...

557
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,382
... absolutely certain.

558
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:43,690
Jack, tell me one thing in life
that is absolutely certain.

559
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:50,163
My daughter's love.

560
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:55,434
What l need is your best guess,
and l think l've heard it.

561
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:03,149
Haven't l?

562
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:16,862
The bastards took away
my book shop and my books.

563
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:21,661
l'm sor´ry, you can't come.
You haven't got the training.

564
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:26,465
- This mission will be ve´ry messy.
- l can fire a gun.

565
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:52,998
Sor´ry, Dennis.

566
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:28,527
- Where are you taking me, Marty?.
- lt's you who have taken us, Jack.

567
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:33,404
lnto battle.

568
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:49,920
Airborne support in target area.
ETA, 35 seconds.

569
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:26,883
SAS team on the ground.

570
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:42,834
Enlarge camp 18.

571
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:48,111
Enlarge prima´ry target.

572
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:58,223
That is a kill.

573
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:13,766
Targets have been neutralised.

574
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:25,786
Airborne support approaching.

575
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:59,348
SAS team withdrawing.

576
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:11,162
We're passing out of visual.

577
01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:26,476
lt's over.

578
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:59,371
Come on, honey.

579
01:32:33,247 --> 01:32:38,082
- Would your men like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

580
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:42,552
Thank you, Miss Ryan,
for inviting us to your homecoming.

581
01:32:42,757 --> 01:32:48,195
You're a gracious host, and it's my
pleasure to make your acquaintance.

582
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:51,388
You're welcome.

583
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:56,866
l'll make the presentation
after dinner.

584
01:32:57,071 --> 01:33:00,040
Would you like to see it now?.

585
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:09,916
- That's ve´ry nice.
- l already gave you one of those.

586
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:27,956
That's your second piece of cake.

587
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:32,731
- Where's the bathroom?
- Second door on the left.

588
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:36,307
- More coffee?
- l'd love some.

589
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:39,775
- Excuse me.
- Here it comes.

590
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:43,676
Bathroom.

591
01:33:43,884 --> 01:33:48,844
- There's someone in there.
- No, that's the basement.

592
01:33:56,397 --> 01:33:59,764
- Hello.
- Jack, it's Marty.

593
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:03,664
l thought
you'd like to know right away.

594
01:34:03,871 --> 01:34:08,774
- SAS just identified Cooley.
- What about the others?

595
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:13,913
Pretty messy. lt'll take 48 hours
to verify the dental records.

596
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:17,949
They're keeping right on it.

597
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:23,749
The storm knocked the power.
l have to light some candles.

598
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:28,258
- l'll light one foryou, too.
- Thanks, Marty.

599
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:35,325
Forget to pay your bill, Cath?

600
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:39,529
- ls eve´ryone all right?
- Just fine.

601
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:45,337
This only happens when
we have royalty over for dinner.

602
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:55,188
- ls something wrong?
- Come with me.

603
01:34:57,425 --> 01:35:01,225
The storm would have knocked out
the lights in the boathouse, too.

604
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:05,729
The power comes in
from the street and branches off.

605
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:09,531
Jesus!

606
01:35:10,571 --> 01:35:14,530
This is Ryan. Any DSS agent?

607
01:35:14,742 --> 01:35:19,372
Ma´ryland Troopers? Anyone?

608
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:23,414
Anyone reading me?
Anybody?

609
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:30,716
- Can l come down later on?
- You've got to get some sleep.

610
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:33,223
Goddamn!

611

612
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:49,705
Take your hands off me!
What are you doing?

Gun.

614

How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?.

618
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:36,815
Five, six ... maybe more.

Don't turn on the lights.

620

Climb up on the stool.
Shine the light up there.

625
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:16,081
God, Jack, what did you do

01:42:12,092 --> 01:42:14,754
They're all over the place.

642
01:42:18,499 --> 01:42:23,198
How were you going to get away?.
Do l go for the other knee?

643
01:42:24,671 --> 01:42:29,370
Boats at the bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.

644
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:31,771
Kevin!

645
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,406

- Any contact?
- They're still off the air.

650
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:44,135
There he is!

Come on.

654
01:46:31,151 --> 01:46:35,349
He's alone.
He's leading us away from the royal.

655

- Turn around.
- No.

656
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:42,527

661
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:27,807
There's no time for pancakes.
Toast or ... toast?
