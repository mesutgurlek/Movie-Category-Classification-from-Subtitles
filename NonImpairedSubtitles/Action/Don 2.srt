1
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,080
I thought this time you'd
be captured...

2
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:14,640
or that I'd lose you.

3
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:17,957
To whom?
Roma?

4
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,280
The disc which you gave the police?!
It's a fake.

5
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,840
There was nothing in it.

6
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,765
Don't worry sweetheart...

7
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,432
Now I rule over the Asian underworld
I am the King!

8
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,765
It's been five years since that day.

9
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,280
And I... Don... rule over the
Asian drug trade.

10
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:42,685
The King.

11
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,605
Now my target is Europe.

12
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,285
The European drug cartel is aware that...

13
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,560
I will takeover their market
by undercutting the prices.

14
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:52,680
Once I establish my presence in Europe...

15
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,285
they will be out of business.

16
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,125
You speak to me like that again...

17
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,151
I will have my man here slit your throat!

18
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,419
How dare you speak to me...

19
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:01,599
I speak the way I want.

20
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,632
Gentlemen...

21
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,045
gents...

22
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,800
This is Jimmy Coogan...

23
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:10,485
<i>this cartel's boss.</i>

24
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,245
He has brought everyone together...

25
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,640
so that they can set
aside their personal issues...

26
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:18,156
and decide about my fate.

27
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,552
All those in favour of killing Don?

28
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,765
Very well then!

29
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,475
I learnt about this meeting
a little late.

30
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,280
Every heart is beating fast

31
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:26,220
<i>Guess who is here</i>

32
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:28,918
Don.

33
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,520
Jaruwan says he is grateful
to see you at his door again.

34
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:55,880
I'm not here for Jaruwan's door...

35
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:58,190
but for my consignment.

36
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,431
There goes your consignment.

37
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,845
Damn!

38
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,579
Now I'll have to drive the boat.

39
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:11,279
You aren't going anywhere, Don.

40
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,480
What brings about this hospitality?

41
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,232
Jimmy Coogan.

42
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,480
If we want to enter the
drug trade in Europe...

43
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:21,765
your life is our ticket.

44
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,440
And I guess he is the ticket collector.

45
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:27,357
Hello big boy!

46
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:29,205
Any last wish?

47
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,880
Which restaurant in Bangkok
serves the best Italian meal?

48
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,685
Meaning?

49
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,560
Well, after killing all of you, I was
hoping to go for a good Italian dinner.

50
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:42,600
You know, spaghetti bolognese,
a glass of red wine...

51
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,365
No?
What?

52
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,175
Nobody likes Italian?

53
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,951
What a shame!
Shoot him!

54
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,678
Quick! After him!

55
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,358
See you around.

56
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,885
Good evening!
Hi Roma!IHi!

57
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,312
Is this the file I'd asked for?!
YeslT hanks.

58
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,192
It's him!

59
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,205
Any plans for tonight?!
Nothing, why?

60
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,269
Because it's your birthday.
We should celebrate.

61
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,910
My birthday?

62
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,759
It's not my birthday today, Arjun.

63
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,765
I know.

64
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,679
Actually it's my birthday.

65
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,160
Oh my God! I'm so sorry...
I completely forgot!

66
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:20,600
Happy birthday, Arjun.

67
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:21,925
Thanks.

68
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,880
Just a second.

69
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:25,439
Hello...

70
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,831
I'll be right there.
Okay.

71
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,674
Happy birthday!
Thank you.

72
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,756
You wanted to see me, sir?!
Yes.

73
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,391
Have a seat.

74
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,917
Roma, do you know how long
I've served in this department?

75
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,830
37 years.

76
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,577
And in these 37 years
I've worked on 186 cases.

77
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:02,674
I've worked with
very brave and able officers.

78
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,237
But I know I'll miss you the most.

79
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,365
I'm sorry, sir?

80
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm retiring, Romal
What?

81
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:18,685
Yes.

82
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,792
I wanted to tell you myself.

83
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,120
Come on, I'm not dying!

84
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,205
Come...
walk me to my car.

85
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,400
Sir... you could reconsider your decision...

86
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,756
I don't want tol
What about Don?

87
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,320
He is the only one who got away!

88
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:45,137
He is your responsibility now.

89
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:47,920
And I know you will do it.

90
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,800
Good evening, Mr. Malik.

91
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,925
Don?

92
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,920
Put your hands up!
Up where I can see them.

93
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:01,557
Take it easy guys...

94
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:03,125
Down on your knees!

95
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,845
Really? I'm wearing white!

96
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,365
Shut up and get down on your knees.

97
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,712
I am very happy to see you too,
my wild cat.

98
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,917
Watch it!

99
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,837
<i>Why is every one so angry?</i>

100
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,005
Absolute immunity.

101
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,805
Drop all charges against me.

102
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,120
In Malaysia and in every country
where there's a warrant out for me.

103
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:31,094
You're a wanted man in every country!

104
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:34,033
How can I convince them all?!
Really?

105
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,474
My mother would've been
so proud to hear that.

106
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,565
Proud?

107
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,525
She would've shot you herself!

108
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,837
Mr. Malik, you didn't know my mother.

109
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,396
Immunity or nothing!

110
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,365
Don, that's impossible!

111
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,720
I could probably save you
from the death penalty.

112
00:11:57,755 --> 00:11:59,285
That's all!

113
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,160
The names of my clients,
my suppliers, every one involved...

114
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:05,674
for all that information and evidence...

115
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,993
your offer is quite small, Mr. Malik.

116
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,860
Do something about it.
You know...

117
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:14,600
Make me an offer I can't refuse.

118
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:16,398
Okay.

119
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,045
If you don't cooperate with us...

120
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,871
Believe me, along with the prison term,
you'll also get the death penalty.

121
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,153
We all die, Mr. Malik.

122
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,679
Perhaps going to jail now
will be to my advantage.

123
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,190
I've waited far too long for this day.

124
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,880
How does it feel...
to be in prison?

125
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:08,765
Yeah, it's okay.

126
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,365
I'm unhappy with the
uniform colour...

127
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,679
But you don't look happy either.
What is it?

128
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,276
Your unexpected change of heart...

129
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,765
why are you putting on this act?

130
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,120
In this trade, when people covet
your death more than your life...

131
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:32,590
it's understood that
it's time to move on.

132
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,400
I figured I'd do something
good along the way but...

133
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:40,240
you people didn't give me a chance.
Very sad!

134
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:42,125
Had we given you that chance,

135
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,320
you would've provided us
with the actual information...

136
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:48,080
Isn't that right'?!
Yeah, that's right.

137
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:51,474
I've lied to you once before...

138
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,833
and I didn't like itl
Shut up!

139
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,880
For once, I wanted to
see you behind bars...

140
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:20,679
and now I have.

141
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,432
So goodbye, Don!

142
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,790
If you let me live,
it would be your biggest mistake.

143
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,553
Welcome to hell, Don.

144
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,474
Shower 14's drain is clogged.

145
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,160
Inform housekeeping.

146
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,516
Still upset?

147
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,845
I'm here to offer my friendship.

148
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,205
Let go of the past!
Let go of what?

149
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,880
I've been trapped in this cage
for five years thanks to you!

150
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:26,765
You're here because of your
ego, Vardhaan.

151
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,918
You don't know how to change with
time and circumstance.

152
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,918
Come on!

153
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,517
Get up!

154
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,080
If you know,
then what are you doing here?

155
00:16:42,115 --> 00:16:45,755
I've come here for you, Vardhaan.

156
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,445
With an offer.

157
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,269
Well, I have an offer too.

158
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,880
How about I cut you to pieces and
feed you to the dogs in here?

159
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,240
That will benefit neither you nor me,
Vardhaan.

160
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:00,753
Only the dogs!

161
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,670
And I hate dogs!

162
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,685
I'm on death row, Vardhaan.

163
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,480
Whether you kill me now
or the law does in two weeks...

164
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:14,517
it's all the same.

165
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,045
Think, Vardhaan!

166
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,160
I could have surrendered
myself in any country...

167
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:22,445
yet I chose this one.

168
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,271
Though I know you are here,
eager to kill me.

169
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,196
Don!

170
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,439
Get out of here!
All of you... out!

171
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,037
Go on...

172
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,640
I've come to help you escape.

173
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:04,280
In exchange for'?

174
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
You'll know when the time is right.

175
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:07,312
No, no...

176
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,245
You will tell me right now!

177
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,280
All you need to do right now is to decide
whether you want to escape or not...

178
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:18,440
If this is another of your tricks...

179
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:20,795
Trust me, no tricks.

180
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,320
What do I have to do'?

181
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:25,277
Good.

182
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,920
Two days later, the kitchen supplies
are going to be delivered.

183
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,565
You see him?

184
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,019
I want that janitor's duty.
Pronto.

185
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:04,439
Okay, but... I
Do it, pleaselOkay.

186
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,605
Now what?

187
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,325
Now we wait till Saturday.

188
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,940
Why'? What happens on Saturday?

189
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:29,485
My attorney will pay me a visit.

190
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,160
Any more questions?!
Yes, one more. May I ask?

191
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:39,473
No! Got your answer?
Good night.

192
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,310
Tonight we get out of here...
you ready?

193
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,755
Oh yes!

194
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,034
Hey, you want to eat my food?

195
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:03,909
You don't want'?
Hate fish!

196
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,313
Help!

197
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,920
He's dying, we need help here.

198
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:18,925
He's dyillQ

199
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,873
Thank you...
My friend is very sick.

200
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,380
Hi...

201
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:02,325
Hi.

202
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,200
Hope I'm not disturbing you?

203
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:06,237
No, not at all.

204
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,320
Are those for me?

205
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,913
Yeah!

206
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,805
Thanks.

207
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,878
Come in!
Thanks.

208
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,469
Who is this?

209
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,313
My brother...
Ramesh.

210
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,040
Your brother...

211
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,277
Where is he?

212
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,835
He's dead.

213
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,314
I am sorry.

214
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,357
That's okay.

215
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,765
Roma, remember
you once told me that...

216
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,510
you didn't want to think about anything
else till Don was arrested?

217
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,118
I do.

218
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,839
Well now the situation is...

219
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,429
that your phone is ringing yet again.

220
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,835
I am sorry... just a second...

221
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,116
Hello?

222
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,198
When?

223
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,592
Mesmerising and alluring

224
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,449
Is his magic

225
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,598
Mesmerising and alluring

226
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,351
Is his magic

227
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,565
He whose eyes are stars

228
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,480
He who is adorned with diamonds

229
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:53,437
0 heart, is it true?

230
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,400
O tell me

231
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:01,645
He is here

232
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,920
Hold on to your heart,
say it out loud

233
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:10,405
<i>Guess who it is</i>

234
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,420
He is here, once again

235
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:21,075
Don

236
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,952
I'm the mystery that no one gets

237
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,516
My moves are above everyone else

238
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,398
I'm the mystery that no one gets

239
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,175
My moves are above everyone else

240
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,080
I'm deeper than the ocean

241
00:27:24,115 --> 00:27:28,532
never standing still

242
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:32,950
I'm denser than smoke

243
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,405
that never stops rising

244
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,680
Hold on to your heart,
say it out loud

245
00:27:44,715 --> 00:27:48,405
<i>Guess who it is</i>

246
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,300
He is here, once again

247
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:58,152
Don

248
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:26,120
You aren't like smoke,
you are the flame

249
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:33,027
If I come closer to you,
I'll burn and die

250
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:38,527
If it's me you desire,
what else will you get?

251
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:43,993
Where do I go next,
even I don't have a clue

252
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,240
Hold on to your heart,
say it out loud

253
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:52,845
<i>Guess who it is</i>

254
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,880
He is here, once again

255
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:01,549
Don

256
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,476
Don

257
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,078
Here! Now this is what
I want from you.

258
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,800
There's a safety deposit box in
Zurich's Russian Commercial bank...

259
00:29:26,835 --> 00:29:30,165
that belonged to your ex-boss, Boris.

260
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,440
He gave one of the set of keys to you and
the other to your partner, Singhania.

261
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:37,670
I have one key, thanks to you.

262
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,285
Come to think of it, if you had
taken the key from Singhania...

263
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,800
either before poisoning him or even after,
it would've been to your advantage.

264
00:29:43,835 --> 00:29:46,030
What's in that box?

265
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,318
You will know when we open it.

266
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:53,677
Where is the key, Vardhaan'?

267
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,072
Zurich Airport.

268
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,925
Baggage locker number 1-3-5.

269
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,669
Combination lock number 5-4-8-1-7.

270
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,605
Got it.

271
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,240
Sweetheart,
take the next flight out to Zurich.

272
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:14,278
We'll see you there in two days.

273
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,360
You trust this girl completely?

274
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,559
Ayesha.

275
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,438
Sorry?

276
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,198
Ayesha, my name.

277
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,685
You were saying...

278
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,719
I was wondering if a girl like you should
do something as dangerous as this!

279
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,880
<i>I'm not just a pretty face,
Mr. Vardhaan.</i>

280
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,033
I have a lot of other skills too.

281
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,800
See you in Zurich.

282
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:48,632
See ya.

283
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,676
Welcome to Zurich.

284
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,520
Know him'?

285
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,005
Fabian Kohl.

286
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,920
President of the German
Deutsch Zentral Bank.

287
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:01,765
Inﬂuential, powerful and
respected by all.

288
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,920
Not many know that the position
he has occupied for the past 8 years...

289
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:10,805
was meant for someone elsel
Who?

290
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,520
When the committee was setup to
choose the bank's president...

291
00:32:13,555 --> 00:32:16,080
their first choice wasn't Kohl
but someone else.

292
00:32:16,115 --> 00:32:17,479
James Werden.

293
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,320
So why didn't the
committee elect Werden?

294
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,109
Werden was killed in a car accident.

295
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,517
Kohl was behind that accident.

296
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,992
Guess who helped him'?

297
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,765
Singhania'?

298
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,758
That's right, Vardhaan!

299
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,685
But Kohl's messenger wasn't aware that...

300
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,432
Singhania had recorded
their meeting in this tape.

301
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,960
Are we going to blackmail Kohl?

302
00:32:51,995 --> 00:32:55,351
Yes and no.

303
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,525
I will blackmail Kohl...

304
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,270
through the bank's vice-president,
J. K. Diwan.

305
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,715
The vice-president of DZB is an Indian?

306
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,671
Well sweetheart,
we are everywhere.

307
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,278
Why don't we deal with Kohl directly?

308
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,480
A minister is more concerned about
power than the king himself.

309
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:25,759
Kohl's messenger to Singhania
was none other than Diwan.

310
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,757
What's on your mind?

311
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,525
DZB has its currency centre here in Berlin.

312
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,359
And that is where they print the
50 and 100 Euro bills.

313
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,045
How much are we demanding?

314
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,240
I don't want the money!I
Then what?

315
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:49,565
I want the printing plates!

316
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,285
Why on earth would Diwan
give us those plates?

317
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,680
Blackmail or no blackmail,
he will be finished, right?

318
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:55,765
Right!

319
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,640
Therefore it's important to keep
Fabian Kohl and Diwan out of the picture.

320
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:02,085
But how?

321
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,930
With Diwan's help I'll break
into the currency centre.

322
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,200
Even if you do steal the plates,
it's no big deal to make new ones.

323
00:34:18,235 --> 00:34:20,165
Of course it's no big deal, sweetheart.

324
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,660
But new bills don't make
old ones worthless.

325
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,120
By the time the bank
replaces every old bill...

326
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:30,272
it will be years.

327
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,840
By then... how should I say this...

328
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,254
we will be...

329
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:37,634
billionaires!

330
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,240
Yes sir?IRoma, I just had a word
with German Interpol.

331
00:34:48,275 --> 00:34:51,440
Vardhaan and Don
were spotted in Zurich.

332
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:53,805
Don and Vardhaan'?

333
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,620
What were they doing together?

334
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:57,365
That's what we need to find out.

335
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,200
The car they were travelling in
was found at a lonely spot in Berlin...

336
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:03,840
Leave for Berlin immediately!
Right away, sir.

337
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,400
I have spoken with the Director
of Intelligence, Klaus Wetland.

338
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:12,312
He is attending a charity
fundraiser tomorrow. -Right.

339
00:35:12,347 --> 00:35:17,190
He'll meet you there. All the best!
Okay, sir. Thank you!

340
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,200
Excuse me, gentlemen...

341
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:33,965
Mr. Wetland?
Roma Bhagat.

342
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,280
Detective Malik may have
spoken to you about melYes, he did.

343
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:39,045
This is Detective Jens Berkel.

344
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,174
He will be working the case with you.

345
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:43,269
Nice to meet youl
Pleased to meet you.

346
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,120
Detective Malik wanted me to
personally thank you for all your help.

347
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:50,920
Tell Malik, he owes me one.

348
00:35:50,955 --> 00:35:52,513
Big time!

349
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,205
I will, sir.

350
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,645
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

351
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,598
Thank you all for
being here with us today...

352
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:01,516
and putting your heart
ahead of your wallet.

353
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,080
Would you please join me
to welcome here today...

354
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:06,405
our esteemed guest of honour...

355
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,992
the Vice President of the DZB...
Mr. J.K. Diwan.

356
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,040
We raise our glasses to your health.
Cheers!

357
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:34,605
Cheers!

358
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,960
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,280
Enjoy the rest of the evening.

360
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,197
Thank you.

361
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,597
What happened?

362
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,597
That man...

363
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,118
I don't know why but
I feel like I know him.

364
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,880
Only if he didn't look like he did...

365
00:39:24,915 --> 00:39:27,030
lam sure...

366
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,837
Find him, Arjun.

367
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,640
It is extremely important because
if it wasn't for your support...

368
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:39,560
we would never be able
to raise any funds.

369
00:39:39,595 --> 00:39:41,812
Your phone is ringing.

370
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:44,030
My phone'? - Yeah.

371
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,100
Excuse me.

372
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:52,525
Hello?

373
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,285
Congratulations on the new phone,
Diwan.

374
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,518
The inbox has a video clip
which I'm sure you'll find interesting.

375
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,678
I suggest you see it alone...
or it could prove embarrassing.

376
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,360
I kept my word.

377
00:40:20,395 --> 00:40:22,205
Now it's your turn.

378
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,419
Once Mr Werden
is elected as president...

379
00:40:24,454 --> 00:40:26,598
it will be difficult to make our move.

380
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
Don't worry, it will be done.

381
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,605
I told you it was interesting

382
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,320
Apart from this clip,
I also have a bank document.

383
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:42,000
It states that a million
dollars were transferred...

384
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:44,205
to Singhania's Swiss bank account.

385
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,551
Singhania? I don't know any... I
Signed by you!

386
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,480
It is your good fortune that
I am a nice guy.

387
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:56,205
What I want is no big deal for you.

388
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,960
There's a black car outside,
registration number BIU 103.

389
00:40:59,995 --> 00:41:02,013
You have...

390
00:41:02,048 --> 00:41:04,031
two minutes.

391
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,118
Who are you?

392
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,518
Don?

393
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,869
No autographs please!

394
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,240
Damn it! Get the car!

395
00:41:56,275 --> 00:41:57,605
You are crazy!

396
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,400
Do you have any idea
what you're asking for?

397
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:00,285
Of course.

398
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,765
I want the information that will help me

399
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,189
get inside the underground
vault of the DZB.

400
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,365
Listen... if you want money...

401
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,960
please just name your amount,
you will get it.

402
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:10,965
What you're asking for is impossible.

403
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,393
Would you and Fabian Kohl rather spend
the rest of your lives in prison?

404
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,280
The details of what I want
are on the phone.

405
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:22,953
And Diwan...

406
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,193
You have 24 hours.

407
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,031
Roma! There!

408
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,950
I see you... my wild cat.

409
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,765
Don!

410
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,519
If I'm caught with you... IRelax Diwan.

411
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,800
It is not just difficult to catch Don...

412
00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:11,916
It's impossible!

413
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
Are you alright?

414
00:45:10,515 --> 00:45:12,436
Everybody okay?

415
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:14,357
Step aside sir.

416
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,400
Police business.
Step away from the car!

417
00:45:17,435 --> 00:45:20,358
It's my car...

418
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,196
Get out! Please!

419
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,154
Got any money?

420
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,557
There he is.

421
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,240
Times up, sorry Roma.

422
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:29,356
See you soon.

423
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,525
Hello.

424
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,756
A moment please sir.

425
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,833
Sorry, I have to go.

426
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,989
This will destroy us.

427
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,325
Do what ever you have to do Diwan.

428
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,911
I don't want to hear about that man,
Don, ever again.

429
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,476
Is that understood?

430
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,125
So Mr. Diwan...

431
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,198
how can Abdul Jabbar
be of assistance?

432
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,749
I've heard you are a useful man.

433
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,436
You've heard right.

434
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,765
What's the job?

435
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,120
You know of Don, of course?

436
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:30,365
Hmm...

437
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,765
He is in Berlin right now.

438
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,918
I want you to trace him down and...

439
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,833
you know...

440
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,758
Why'?

441
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,720
Why do you want him killed,
Mr. Diwan?

442
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:56,270
You need reason or money?

443
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,439
Now you're talking!

444
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,356
Five million Euro.

445
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,045
Half now and...

446
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,630
the rest when I hand you his head.

447
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,845
That's not necessary.

448
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,558
I want it done.
As soon as possible!

449
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,085
Vardhaan!

450
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:40,605
Now do you see why
we never get along?

451
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,960
It would be better if instead
of watching cartoons...

452
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:45,600
you were thinking about
the security at the DZB.

453
00:49:45,635 --> 00:49:46,685
Really?

454
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,965
Even if Diwan does help...

455
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,480
stealing those plates from the DZB
won't be a cakewalk.

456
00:49:51,515 --> 00:49:54,085
I know, Vardhaan.

457
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,920
We need a computer hacker to control
the building's security system.

458
00:49:57,955 --> 00:50:01,436
My remote, please.

459
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,780
Thank you!

460
00:50:03,815 --> 00:50:05,205
But who?

461
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,000
All our useful men are
either in prison or...

462
00:50:08,035 --> 00:50:09,991
on the FBI and Interpol watch list.

463
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,485
Relax Vardhaan.

464
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:17,674
I know just the guy for this task.

465
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,240
Hey! Watch out!I
Are you crazy?

466
00:50:23,275 --> 00:50:24,833
Sorry!

467
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,045
Thank you for coming, Sameer.

468
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,685
Not at all, sir, please... I mean...

469
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,080
I had to see for myself that
it really was you who called.

470
00:50:44,115 --> 00:50:46,993
I'm just a big fan, sirl
Sir?

471
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,445
That sounds too 'honest'.

472
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,950
Call me Don.
I have a job for you.

473
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,120
The security system at the
DZB's currency centre...

474
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:00,925
is controlled by a master computer.

475
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,960
I want you to hack into this computer...

476
00:51:02,995 --> 00:51:07,272
so that it's under my control.

477
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,554
I'm really sorry sir... Don.

478
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,365
I don't think I can do itl
Really?

479
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,800
Is it the Sameer Ali who at 17 hacked
into the Tokyo Stock Exchange and...

480
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:22,685
stole 1.4 million dollars?

481
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,880
And then donated it anonymously
to 'Save the Oceans' foundation.

482
00:51:25,915 --> 00:51:28,838
There's nothing to prove that I did it.

483
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,357
And if there's no evidence,
you aren't guilty.

484
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,480
Isn't that right?

485
00:51:34,515 --> 00:51:36,198
Touché!

486
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,400
You've been quite low key
the past three years.

487
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:44,512
I'm sure love has something to do with it.

488
00:51:44,547 --> 00:51:47,590
Actually tell me... I like love stories.

489
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,957
She is a...

490
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,080
she's very special.

491
00:51:52,115 --> 00:51:54,045
I am sure she is.

492
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,525
But so is your talent.

493
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,589
It would be a shame
not to put it to use at right time.

494
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,958
I can't.

495
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:11,551
I promised Yana that
I won't do anything illegal.

496
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,917
If there's no evidence,
you aren't guilty, right'?

497
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,832
Hey...

498
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,205
where were you?

499
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,120
I had the interview, remember?

500
00:52:40,155 --> 00:52:43,829
Oh yeah, how did it go?

501
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,720
I got the job, Yana.

502
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,354
That's great, Sam.

503
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,829
How are you feeling?

504
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,071
I feel good.

505
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,565
A little bit tired... but good.

506
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,480
He's not troubling you too much, is he?

507
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:06,678
No. He's very well behaved.

508
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,525
At 1:18pm

509
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,756
there are two people in the car.

510
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,800
<i>Exactly 6 minutes later...</i>

511
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:14,633
Here, look carefully.

512
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,845
Only one!

513
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,640
That means the passenger got off...

514
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:23,400
somewhere between Tiergarten Strasse...

515
00:54:23,435 --> 00:54:27,605
and 17th Juli Strasse.

516
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,349
Probably someone saw
him get out of the car.

517
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,685
Possible.

518
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,365
I'll talk to Berkel.

519
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,394
If there's a witness,
we'll find him.

520
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,605
Hello...

521
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:50,237
Diwan, I'm sure you are
impressed by my punctuality.

522
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,125
So, what have you decided?

523
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,840
I'm willing to give you what you want.

524
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,045
Good.

525
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,039
Tomorrow morning at 8,
outside the Berlin Cathedral.

526
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,605
Now what?

527
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,760
You will do exactly as he wants you to.

528
00:55:06,795 --> 00:55:08,876
What do you mean?

529
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,920
I can't give him that information!

530
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:14,196
Who said it has to be real'?

531
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,200
By the time Don figures it out...

532
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:20,589
He will be dead, Mr. Diwan.

533
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,045
Hello?

534
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,560
A sightseeing bus
is approaching from your left.

535
00:55:38,595 --> 00:55:39,675
I see it.

536
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,440
It will stop in front of you.

537
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:45,239
Come to the upper deck!

538
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,038
Let's go.

539
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,676
Everything you've asked for
is in these discs.

540
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,640
The blueprints of the currency centre,
security protocols and...

541
00:56:24,675 --> 00:56:26,925
all codes to access the building.

542
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,480
What about the safe
containing the plates?

543
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:33,297
That safe is in the underground vault.

544
00:56:33,332 --> 00:56:37,045
It can only be opened by a passkey...

545
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,120
which is in the custody of the centre's
chief technician, Dr. Schneider.

546
00:56:41,155 --> 00:56:43,111
Anything else?

547
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,715
Apart from the passkey,
the safe also requires...

548
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:51,191
Dr. Schneider's fingerprints
and voice match.

549
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,720
Look honestly,
you've got to trust me.

550
00:56:59,755 --> 00:57:01,955
I'm telling you the truth.

551
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,156
You have beautiful eyes...

552
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,237
I trust you.

553
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,365
Keep this phone on you.

554
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,000
You have a reservation
at the Hotel de Rome.

555
00:57:14,035 --> 00:57:16,965
Stay there until my next call.

556
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,160
But what about the tape
and documents?

557
00:57:20,195 --> 00:57:22,605
Relax Diwan.

558
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,520
You'll get what you deserve.

559
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,596
Take the stairs.

560
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,157
Karl, you stay herel
Yeah.

561
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,153
You!

562
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,117
Jabbar...

563
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,880
Don may not keep
in touch with his friends...

564
01:00:58,915 --> 01:01:02,271
but he always checks on his enemies.

565
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,880
Someone is following you, sir.

566
01:01:16,915 --> 01:01:19,030
Thanks, Sameer.

567
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,240
You want this, right?

568
01:01:21,275 --> 01:01:23,151
No, Don.

569
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,272
I want to kill you.

570
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,880
We seem to have a problem.

571
01:01:29,915 --> 01:01:31,405
You see...

572
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,485
I prefer to stay alive.

573
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,832
I think you'll have
to change your intention.

574
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,445
I suggest you join with me.

575
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,760
Whatever money
Diwan has promised you...

576
01:01:46,795 --> 01:01:49,434
I'll give you three times more.

577
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,277
Think about it.

578
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,673
I don't want to put you...

579
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,200
under any pressure!

580
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,160
We found someone.

581
01:02:08,195 --> 01:02:09,165
That's great!

582
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,885
Someone at the station
has identified Don's car.

583
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,600
And he also got a good look
at the person who got out.

584
01:02:14,635 --> 01:02:16,045
Super! Where is he'?

585
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,005
He's with the sketch artist.

586
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,440
Okay, let me know
when the sketch is complete.

587
01:02:19,475 --> 01:02:20,720
Alright then.

588
01:02:20,755 --> 01:02:22,358
Arjun!

589
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,699
Good job.

590
01:02:24,734 --> 01:02:26,198
Thanks.

591
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,598
Don...

592
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,240
Including Jabbar in our plan
was a big mistake.

593
01:02:49,275 --> 01:02:51,205
Really?
- Really.

594
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:54,915
Have you forgotten that
he was hired to kill you?

595
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:00,160
Don's enemies should always remember
that Don never forgets.

596
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:03,165
As for my mistake...

597
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,160
this Abdul Jabbar will be our ticket
to escape from DZB.

598
01:03:07,195 --> 01:03:09,365
Meaning'?
- I mean...

599
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,360
My plan to get us out of the building...

600
01:03:12,395 --> 01:03:14,925
will be a success only if...

601
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,477
we sacrifice Abdul Jabbar and his goons.

602
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,760
Hello sweetheart!

603
01:03:28,795 --> 01:03:30,592
Hello.

604
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,605
Is he dead?

605
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,795
No, but you are!

606
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,198
Don?

607
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,240
Diwan, being stupid enough
to give me blank discs is one thing...

608
01:03:51,275 --> 01:03:53,577
<i>but to hire assassins to kill me...</i>

609
01:03:53,612 --> 01:03:55,880
now that will be your downfall.

610
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,297
Please Don!

611
01:03:57,332 --> 01:03:58,645
Don please...

612
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,325
Please forgive me!

613
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,405
I'm sorry I screwed up.

614
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,400
I'll give you what you want.

615
01:04:02,435 --> 01:04:04,445
Anything you ask of me!

616
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,165
Where is the information I want'?

617
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,320
I have it with me, Don.
It's with me.

618
01:04:09,355 --> 01:04:11,709
Open the door.

619
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,592
Knock knock...

620
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,560
Sir, did you order room service?

621
01:04:18,595 --> 01:04:20,597
Say 'yes'.

622
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,885
Yes, I...

623
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,309
I ordered room service.

624
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,925
But you...

625
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,474
Give her the information.

626
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,313
I have got it.

627
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,760
As a penalty you'll have to do
another thing for me, Diwan.

628
01:04:56,795 --> 01:04:58,445
Wait...

629
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,949
Wait for my call.

630
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,198
That's him.

631
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,119
I've seen him before...

632
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,912
Where...

633
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,480
He was at the charity fund raiser...

634
01:05:21,515 --> 01:05:24,560
his name...
the guest of honour...

635
01:05:24,595 --> 01:05:25,297
J. K. Diwan.

636
01:05:25,332 --> 01:05:26,065
That's it!

637
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,640
The Vice-President of the DZB.

638
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:28,605
Isn't it?

639
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,125
Yeah, you are right.

640
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,160
But... what was he doing
in the car with Don?

641
01:05:34,195 --> 01:05:36,515
That's what we have to find out!

642
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,518
Okay!

643
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,360
This building has state of the art security!

644
01:06:03,395 --> 01:06:06,213
But obviously that's not news to you.

645
01:06:06,248 --> 01:06:09,032
Can you control their computers or not?

646
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,512
Since you have put your trust in me,
I can't let you down.

647
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,600
I can control everything
except the underground vault.

648
01:06:18,635 --> 01:06:19,925
What about the vault?

649
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,939
The vault isn't linked
to the master computer.

650
01:06:22,974 --> 01:06:25,919
It's controls are in the vault's
enclosure.

651
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:30,520
The electric supply to the vault
is from a remote source.

652
01:06:30,555 --> 01:06:34,070
Okay, we'll deal with that.

653
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,560
We'll figure the vault from the inside.

654
01:06:37,595 --> 01:06:39,198
Sir...

655
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,554
Yeah?

656
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,393
You see...

657
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,895
I don't mean to demoralise anyone but...

658
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:50,230
we should realise
what we're up against.

659
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,880
As soon as you enter DZB
is the first security check point...

660
01:06:56,915 --> 01:06:58,925
metal detectors, baggage x-ray.

661
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,765
A little ahead is the lobby
with CCTV cameras all over and...

662
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:07,159
these are monitored round the clock by
security guards in the surveillance room.

663
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,060
There's a door to enter the vault...

664
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:14,565
which can be opened by a password.

665
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,925
The stairs inside lead
to the underground vault.

666
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:22,120
At the foot is a metal gate manned
by two security guards.

667
01:07:22,155 --> 01:07:25,405
If you manage to get past them...

668
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,880
you'll reach the first
entrance to the printing chamber.

669
01:07:28,915 --> 01:07:31,960
The security guards will
have the key to that.

670
01:07:31,995 --> 01:07:34,320
The real problem lies ahead.

671
01:07:34,355 --> 01:07:35,765
The main vault.

672
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,685
It is a sold steel chamber.

673
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:42,360
The emergency procedure is to lock
the door and smash the controls.

674
01:07:42,395 --> 01:07:46,513
I mean, it's impossible to get
through it.

675
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,205
Fine, we'll blow it up.

676
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,245
No way, sir. Please don't even
think of thatlWhy not?

677
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,600
Because there are two things that
will happen if you try to blow it open.

678
01:07:57,635 --> 01:07:58,765
First...

679
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,845
a chemical gas will release
into the chamber.

680
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,440
The gas isn't lethal but it can knock
a person out for 12 hours.

681
01:08:06,475 --> 01:08:07,845
The second thing?

682
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:11,100
The vault door and the safe are separated
by a 20 foot long passage.

683
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:14,320
Now the floor of this passage
is installed with a security system...

684
01:08:14,355 --> 01:08:17,039
that is activated by even
the slightest pressure.

685
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,198
What happens if the system is activated?

686
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,365
I don't know, sir.

687
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:27,156
But if I were you,
I wouldn't even breathe

688
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:53,365
Karl, Jabbar and his team
of five will wait here.

689
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:58,000
Two of you go up and wait for us
on the fifth floor by this window.

690
01:08:58,035 --> 01:08:59,605
Jabbar...

691
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,400
explosives, guns,
ammunition are your domain.

692
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:06,995
There is no night

693
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:10,671
And no day here

694
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,920
Is it the darkness

695
01:09:12,955 --> 01:09:13,937
This is Dr. Schneider.

696
01:09:13,972 --> 01:09:16,911
I want his finger prints.

697
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:25,595
The eyes are betrayed
but nobody knows

698
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:32,565
Wonder what is here and isn't

699
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,080
Good afternoon,
this is Detective Baruah from Interpol.

700
01:09:35,115 --> 01:09:37,640
May I speak with Dr. Schneider please?

701
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,765
Good afternoon.
- Dr. Schneider?

702
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,165
Yes, I am Diedrich Schneider!
Thank you.

703
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,600
There are many fake ones
like this out on the street.

704
01:09:45,635 --> 01:09:48,085
Could I have the test results by say,
Tuesday?

705
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:52,120
You could get it by tomorrow,
if you wantlNo, Tuesday is just fine.

706
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:54,919
Thank you, Dr. Schneider.

707
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,525
Here you gol
Thank you so much.

708
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:08,520
The eyes are betrayed
but nobody knows

709
01:10:10,155 --> 01:10:10,945
I am Diedrich Schneider.

710
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:16,835
Wonder what is here and isn't

711
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:25,029
All an illusion

712
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,980
The eyes are betrayed
but nobody knows

713
01:11:21,115 --> 01:11:27,040
Wonder what is here and isn't

714
01:11:30,275 --> 01:11:36,052
All an illusion

715
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,885
Don?

716
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,833
How do we escape from DZB'?

717
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:09,800
Here... in the basement...
is the service exit.

718
01:12:09,835 --> 01:12:13,445
Ayesha will wait for us in a police van.

719
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:18,040
We will escape in that van,
smooth and easy.

720
01:12:18,075 --> 01:12:20,680
That's it?

721
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,445
Yeah, that's it...

722
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,714
You've thought of something better?

723
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,838
<i>No'?</i>

724
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,394
I thought so.

725
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:45,674
Then I guess we'll have
to make do with my plan.

726
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,480
Hello...

727
01:13:04,515 --> 01:13:06,393
Diwan...

728
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,670
tomorrow at 3...

729
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,640
behind the Paul Loebe house.

730
01:13:14,675 --> 01:13:17,314
And please...

731
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,955
be on time, Diwan.

732
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:29,833
Nothing can stop me now!

733
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,313
I know Don.

734
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,965
He can sacrifice you...

735
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,679
me or anyone else for his own gain.

736
01:13:41,714 --> 01:13:44,359
Me or anyone else for his own gain.

737
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,756
Is that so?

738
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,720
Then what are you doing with him?

739
01:13:50,755 --> 01:13:52,677
I...

740
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,725
wanted to figure his plan.

741
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,040
I won't make the mistake
of trusting him again.

742
01:13:58,075 --> 01:14:00,756
And quite frankly Jabbar...

743
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,676
neither should you.

744
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,518
Why not?

745
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,919
Don's exit plan says...

746
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,038
you won't get out alive.

747
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,120
He won't leave this place alive!

748
01:14:21,155 --> 01:14:23,397
Jabbar, calm down.

749
01:14:23,432 --> 01:14:25,605
Not now, Jabbar.

750
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,393
Once we have the plates.

751
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,100
I must say Don's plan is pretty good.

752
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:37,997
Imagine, once we have the plates...

753
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,633
it will be raining money!

754
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,885
What about Don'?

755
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:50,154
By the time the cops
find Don's corpse...

756
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,878
we would've escaped
through the service exit.

757
01:14:52,913 --> 01:14:55,356
We would've escaped
through the service exit.

758
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,756
That's it

759
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,829
The sketch does look like
J.K. Diwan...

760
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:54,440
But it is also a fact that we are
relying only on one man's memory.

761
01:15:54,475 --> 01:15:55,925
I know sir...

762
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,112
but I think he is right.

763
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:04,760
Alright, fix an appointment with himl
Thank you, sir.

764
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:06,245
Roma...
- Yes sir?

765
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:10,320
Do remember that J.K. Diwan
is a very important person.

766
01:16:10,355 --> 01:16:13,280
So, word your questions delicately.

767
01:16:13,315 --> 01:16:15,317
I understand, sir.

768
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,925
Hello?

769
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:32,940
Sorry you had to wait but I need to
reschedule our meeting.

770
01:16:34,075 --> 01:16:37,874
Go to DZB and wait for my call.

771
01:16:59,160 --> 01:16:59,905
Hello.

772
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:00,825
How was the drive?

773
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,149
Lots of traffic but it was fine.

774
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,556
I'm sorry.

775
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,260
Hello DZB.

776
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,245
Now what?

777
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,396
Now, we record.

778
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,439
Good Morning Mr Diwan.

779
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,591
Here we go!

780
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,860
Sameer, can you hear me?

781
01:18:28,895 --> 01:18:31,160
Yes, Don! Loud and clear.

782
01:18:31,195 --> 01:18:32,760
Cameras... now!

783
01:18:32,795 --> 01:18:33,885
Copy that.

784
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,311
I'm switching the live video
with the recording.

785
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,925
Hello.
- Good afternoon, sir.

786
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,160
I'm here for my appointment with
Dr. Schneider, please.

787
01:19:24,195 --> 01:19:27,596
He is expecting you.

788
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,240
Good day! Interpol.

789
01:19:34,275 --> 01:19:36,038
Oh shit!

790
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,165
Yes?

791
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,840
Whatever you do,
don't turn around.

792
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:45,805
Who is it'?

793
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,800
Interpol officers Roma and Berkel...

794
01:19:47,835 --> 01:19:50,880
get out of there!

795
01:19:50,915 --> 01:19:53,765
Thank you.

796
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,600
He will see you now on the fourth floor.

797
01:19:55,635 --> 01:19:57,996
Thank you very much.

798
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,958
Good day!

799
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,365
Yes, Patricia?

800
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,845
Good afternoon, sir.

801
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,271
There are some officers here
from the Interpol to meet you.

802
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,230
Send them up please...
in 15 minutes.

803
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:29,431
I have the results of the analysis
on the counterfeit bill you gave me.

804
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,645
Altogether...

805
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,600
there are 7 points
which confirm that it is a fake.

806
01:20:32,635 --> 01:20:36,035
There are 7 points
which confirm that it is a fake.

807
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:39,435
If you see the bluring
in the corner of the ink.

808
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,845
The third point which clearly confirms

809
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,840
that we are holding a fake note
in our hands is the microprint.

810
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:57,560
You see here the real one...
here's the fake one.

811
01:20:57,595 --> 01:21:00,120
In the real note the microprint...

812
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,925
You'll come across a ladder to your left.

813
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,520
Above that is the elevator shaft
ventilation duct.

814
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,476
Excuse me...

815
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,394
Mr. Diwan will meet you now.

816
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,835
I hope it crashes after I get off!

817
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,673
Bye.

818
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,349
Package 1 in position.

819
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,398
Sam, stop the elevator
when I tell you to.

820
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,158
NOW!

821
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,439
Sir button...

822
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,325
The doorman at your
apartment block told us that...

823
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,600
on the 15th you left your
apartment at 11 in the morning...

824
01:23:05,635 --> 01:23:08,080
and returned at half past two.

825
01:23:08,115 --> 01:23:09,360
Is that right'?

826
01:23:09,395 --> 01:23:11,752
The 15th

827
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,085
let me see...

828
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,440
Victor, where were we on the 15th?

829
01:23:15,475 --> 01:23:17,597
Mrs. Bergman's fundraiser, sir.

830
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,720
And what time did we return home?

831
01:23:19,755 --> 01:23:22,685
1:30 pm, sirlT hank you.

832
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:25,340
I think the doorman's
memory is off by an hour.

833
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:27,925
Victor maintains a record of
my every activity.

834
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:32,440
And if he is saying I came home at 1:30,
then that's the truth.

835
01:23:32,475 --> 01:23:35,045
Of course.
Thank you.

836
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,800
No, not at all.
You are most welcome.

837
01:23:37,835 --> 01:23:40,005
If I can help you in any way...

838
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:43,765
please don't hesitate
in getting touch with me.

839
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:49,160
As you can see here
and on this fake one and as you see...

840
01:23:49,195 --> 01:23:51,877
it is the less obvious point...

841
01:23:51,912 --> 01:23:54,559
if it comes to faking a note.

842
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,313
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

843
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,154
<i>Boom!</i>

844
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,952
We have to get you out right now,sir!

845
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,317
Lock the vault immediately.

846
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,834
No idea where it came from...

847
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,405
Shut up!

848
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,273
Let me make some calls
and find out what's going on.

849
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,759
Why are the gates being shut'?

850
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,036
Let's go.

851
01:27:14,071 --> 01:27:15,433
Okay.

852
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,676
Open the gate.

853
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,430
We are in the vault.
Get the hostages!

854
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,845
Sam, it's too bright in here.

855
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,918
Do something, will you?!
Copy that.

856
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,311
Lights.

857
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,157
Emergency lights activated.

858
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,245
You don't understand!

859
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:17,040
I am answerable to the
German government and its people.

860
01:29:17,075 --> 01:29:19,117
Please, I must stay!
Hello?

861
01:29:19,152 --> 01:29:21,160
Good evening, Mr. Malik.

862
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:23,037
Don?

863
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,165
It's Don!

864
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,560
I'd like to speak with Roma, please.

865
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:30,160
How do you know...

866
01:29:30,195 --> 01:29:32,685
Oh my God!

867
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:35,720
God won't come here, Mr. Malik.

868
01:29:35,755 --> 01:29:37,377
He is in the building.

869
01:29:37,412 --> 01:29:39,582
Let me talk to Roma.

870
01:29:39,617 --> 01:29:41,753
He wants to talk to you.

871
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,685
Hello?

872
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:48,076
Roma, Roma...

873
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,085
you aren't giving up, are you?

874
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:55,830
People might think you still love me.

875
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:57,845
What do you want?

876
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:00,765
I'd like to give you a last chance.

877
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,560
I want you to drop
all charges against me.

878
01:30:03,595 --> 01:30:05,685
You've already seen one explosion.

879
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:10,800
I can set off other
explosions around the building.

880
01:30:10,835 --> 01:30:15,880
And seeing you so close
to me is suffocating me.

881
01:30:15,915 --> 01:30:18,400
So everybody...
move back a little please!

882
01:30:18,435 --> 01:30:19,325
What is he saying?

883
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,685
If we don't move our men back...

884
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,518
he is going to detonate another
explosive.

885
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,445
He's bluffingl.
- No, I am not.

886
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:29,800
Roma, tell Commissioner Mueller to take
a look at the fire truck in front of him.

887
01:30:29,835 --> 01:30:34,510
In 30 seconds it'll blow up.

888
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,605
Damn it!

889
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:39,951
Move all your men back,
we have only 30 seconds.

890
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,920
What?

891
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:21,925
Hello...

892
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:25,298
is it me you're looking for...

893
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:28,636
What do you want?!
My wild cat...

894
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,120
Anybody comes within
100 feet of this building and...

895
01:31:32,155 --> 01:31:34,680
I'll set off more explosions.

896
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:39,285
Understood?!
Yes.

897
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:43,845
I'm watching all of you,
especially you...

898
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:47,800
so no tricks please. And get this
damn helicopter to buzz off!

899
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,960
It's spoiling the mood, sweetheart.

900
01:31:50,995 --> 01:31:53,349
Don!

901
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,991
Damn it!

902
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:10,319
The cops are going to be busy
deciding their next strategy.

903
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:14,605
Are all our men in position?IYes.

904
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:18,440
And the bombs'? - They're ready.
Exactly where you wanted them.

905
01:32:18,475 --> 01:32:22,559
Very good.
Let's get to work.

906
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:10,872
The gas will be effective
in the chamber for 3 minutes.

907
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,758
I leave the rest to you.

908
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,858
Sam, password?

909
01:34:02,893 --> 01:34:06,356
<i>83675U9</i>

910
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,392
Alarm activated.

911
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,845
Come on!

912
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,791
Get out of there.

913
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,805
That was close!
- Yeah!

914
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:51,240
Where are the plates?!
You think I'd leave without them?

915
01:34:51,275 --> 01:34:54,631
All good. Pass me the bag please.

916
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,917
Thank you.

917
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:05,720
<i>Sam'?</i>

918
01:35:05,755 --> 01:35:06,885
Yes?

919
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,639
Time to go!IGot it.

920
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:25,796
I told you I will never forget
what you did to me.

921
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:29,073
Even so you trusted me.

922
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,630
Plates, please...

923
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,517
Bag.

924
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,158
Not very smart, are you?

925
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,320
You wanted to leave me
behind to die, huh?

926
01:35:54,355 --> 01:35:57,160
Death will come, Don.

927
01:35:57,195 --> 01:35:59,280
Not for me...

928
01:35:59,315 --> 01:36:01,556
But you!

929
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:08,880
Jabbar, if you kill me
how do you plan on escaping?

930
01:36:09,915 --> 01:36:11,965
What do you mean?ll mean...

931
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,520
There is neither a service exit
in the basement...

932
01:36:14,555 --> 01:36:17,405
...nor is Ayesha waiting
in a police van.

933
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:23,250
You see... I didn't have an
escape plan for you at all.

934
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,165
Jabbar! That's a lie!

935
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,920
How did he plan on getting away
if he didn't have an escape plan?

936
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:35,925
Vardhaan...

937
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,874
Perhaps you weren't paying attention.

938
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:45,434
I didn't have an
escape plan for 'you'.

939
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:49,765
You think you can getaway from us?

940
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:55,716
Remember, Sameer said he couldn't
control the electric supply in the vault?

941
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,030
He was lying.

942
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,965
Hey!

943
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,799
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

944
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:11,440
Karl? Karl? What's going on'?

945
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:24,035
Shocking behaviour, dude!

946
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:35,473
Find Don! Go!

947
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,839
Perfect timing, Sam.
- Thanks.

948
01:37:39,874 --> 01:37:42,878
See you outside. Switching off.

949
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,885
Good day.
- Good day.

950
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:57,912
Could you deliver this urgently.

951
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:01,285
Hello, Officer...

952
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:04,153
Listen to me very carefully.

953
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:29,277
So, ready to go.

954
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,434
Yeah...

955
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:33,435
Ready.

956
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,359
Thanks.

957
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,834
Drop the gun.

958
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,115
I said drop the gun!

959
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,232
Drop the gun.

960
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,676
Hands on your head!

961
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,840
You are under arrest, Don!

962
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:09,754
You got mell did.

963
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,077
Cuffs.

964
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,196
Hands behind you.

965
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,073
Ooh... kinky!

966
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,605
Glad you like it.

967
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:27,598
Because they aren't coming off!

968
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:32,359
It's over, Don.

969
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:38,520
Where are your partners?!
You may search my pockets.

970
01:41:38,555 --> 01:41:40,605
Where are they?

971
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:43,440
They aren't my partners... any more,
Mr. Malik.

972
01:41:43,475 --> 01:41:46,285
What do you mean?ll mean...

973
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:51,793
Vardhaan controls them now, not me.

974
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:55,245
Vardhaan is in the building?

975
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:58,725
Vardhaan, Abdul Jabbar and his goons.

976
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:03,277
They are a dangerous bunch...
Be careful.

977
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,956
Come on.

978
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,680
So you let your heart
overcome your mind.

979
01:42:11,715 --> 01:42:13,751
Very sad.

980
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:17,125
It was a momentary lapse
of judgment but...

981
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:21,720
I realised I'm not like youl
You definitely are not!

982
01:42:21,755 --> 01:42:24,045
I have a long life ahead of me...

983
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,640
Whereas you and Yana
don't have a future.

984
01:42:26,675 --> 01:42:29,960
Stop it! Take him away!

985
01:42:29,995 --> 01:42:31,553
Slay!

986
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:42,480
I'd like to speak to the
officer-in-charge.

987
01:42:42,515 --> 01:42:44,365
Vardhaan...

988
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,280
It's coming from inside
the building, sir.

989
01:42:47,315 --> 01:42:49,405
Give it to me.

990
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,200
Detective Malik here.

991
01:42:51,235 --> 01:42:53,177
Hello Malik'?

992
01:42:53,212 --> 01:42:55,085
Vardhaan.

993
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:57,360
You better surrender, Vardhaan.

994
01:42:57,395 --> 01:42:59,245
Why'?

995
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:01,005
I have 25 of DZB's staff as hostages...

996
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:05,685
And you know I won't hesitate
in killing them.

997
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:09,520
You are already in a mess,
don't try anything stupid.

998
01:43:09,555 --> 01:43:10,805
No, no...

999
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:14,285
You'll be stupid to ignore my words.

1000
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:18,080
In two hours I need a helicopter
that will take us to the airport.

1001
01:43:18,115 --> 01:43:20,845
And I need a plane waiting for us.

1002
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,360
When we reach our destination,
I will set the hostages free.

1003
01:43:24,395 --> 01:43:26,497
Is that clear, Malik'?

1004
01:43:26,532 --> 01:43:28,600
That's not possible.

1005
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:31,513
Really?

1006
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,836
Jabbar!

1007
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,471
Vardhaan!

1008
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,885
You hear that?

1009
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,440
If firing into air can have that effect...

1010
01:43:47,475 --> 01:43:50,960
Imagine if I had to shoot one of them.

1011
01:43:50,995 --> 01:43:52,951
Two hours.

1012
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:02,485
Do you know
how Don exited the building?

1013
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:07,959
No, really sorry. I was in touch with him
till he got out of the vault.

1014
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,876
What was he doing in the vault?

1015
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,880
So Sameer confessed everything?

1016
01:44:20,915 --> 01:44:23,920
Answer me... Where are the plates?

1017
01:44:23,955 --> 01:44:25,845
Vardhaan has the plates.

1018
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:28,918
How did you get out of the building?

1019
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:36,480
Answer my question, Don!I
Why should I tell you?

1020
01:44:36,515 --> 01:44:40,557
The hostages could die because of you.

1021
01:44:40,592 --> 01:44:44,565
I regret this is happening,
Mr. Malik.

1022
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:49,720
But if you want my help,
then I want something in return too.

1023
01:44:49,755 --> 01:44:53,005
You are in no position to negotiate.

1024
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:58,353
Well in that case...
I'd like to talk to Mr. Diwan.

1025
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:02,045
Why'?

1026
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:07,951
I think he will empathize with me.

1027
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,965
It's quite simple.

1028
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,080
If I go to prison,
so do you and Fabian Kohl.

1029
01:45:16,115 --> 01:45:18,549
Look you can't...

1030
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:25,760
Please look... Look we had a deal.
I gave you everything you asked for!

1031
01:45:25,795 --> 01:45:30,596
Trust me, this is my last request.
Promise.

1032
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:38,958
He will help us.

1033
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:43,560
Mr. Diwan has promised me immunity
here in Germany.

1034
01:45:43,595 --> 01:45:47,679
For some reason, I trust him.

1035
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:54,300
In return, I'll help diffuse the bombs
and free the hostages.

1036
01:45:54,635 --> 01:45:56,445
What about the plates?

1037
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,840
Don't worry.
You'll get the plates back.

1038
01:45:59,875 --> 01:46:01,837
Roma...

1039
01:46:01,872 --> 01:46:03,765
What?

1040
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:09,165
I want you to believe that
this change of heart isn't an act...

1041
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:13,760
and as a show of good faith,
I'm ready to deliver the discs to you...

1042
01:46:13,795 --> 01:46:19,780
...which will put an end to the
drug trade in Europe and Asia.

1043
01:46:20,915 --> 01:46:23,349
Really?

1044
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,525
Roma, strange isn't it?

1045
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:33,120
Once again life has brought us together.

1046
01:46:33,155 --> 01:46:36,240
You and I can never be together.

1047
01:46:36,275 --> 01:46:38,117
You never know.

1048
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:45,800
Perhaps someday you'll realise that I'm
no longer the same Don that you despise

1049
01:46:45,835 --> 01:46:50,795
Though a dog may straighten its tail,
it is still a dog.

1050
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:56,600
No wonder I can't let go of you,
my wild cat.

1051
01:46:56,635 --> 01:46:59,353
What? Are you going to shoot me'?

1052
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,276
Don't tempt me.

1053
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,677
Let's go.

1054
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,520
Roma, please...
do you really need to do this?

1055
01:47:11,555 --> 01:47:13,079
Yes, I do!
- Why'?

1056
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:17,400
The S.E.K unit can do the job... I
Will you just relax?

1057
01:47:17,435 --> 01:47:21,155
Stay with Mr. Malik, got it'?

1058
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,800
If anything happens to her, I will...

1059
01:47:25,835 --> 01:47:29,919
You will... What'?

1060
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:38,555
Your team is very concerned
about each other.

1061
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,276
Sweet!

1062
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:49,598
Gentlemen... enjoy the swim.

1063
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,845
Where's Don?
- Forget him!

1064
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,271
If he wants to live,
he won't come back.

1065
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,600
Okay, which way now?

1066
01:48:09,635 --> 01:48:11,637
Follow me.

1067
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:22,477
So, what's the deal
between you and... Arjun?

1068
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:26,125
It doesn't concern you.

1069
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:29,285
Thought we'd catch up.
Is that wrong?

1070
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:34,000
You? Besides yourself, you are incapable
of thinking about anything.

1071
01:48:34,035 --> 01:48:36,071
And you.

1072
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:49,274
You guys take cover
behind the door.

1073
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,839
Herman, go.

1074
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,718
Roma.

1075
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,125
What?

1076
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:20,560
When I said, I was ready
to give the police the disc...

1077
01:49:20,595 --> 01:49:23,313
How did you feel?

1078
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:33,080
Your words no longer
have an effect on me.

1079
01:49:33,115 --> 01:49:37,957
I know... but still you were surprised.

1080
01:49:37,992 --> 01:49:42,765
Roma, the fact is I'm tired of my life.

1081
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:47,120
Now I loathe people like
Vardhaan and Coogan.

1082
01:49:47,155 --> 01:49:51,120
I want to be free from them
and the law.

1083
01:49:51,155 --> 01:49:54,750
I want to be a free man.

1084
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:59,640
Please...

1085
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:03,285
Forgive me, Roma.

1086
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:05,755
Come on, we are clear.

1087
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:27,125
Wait Roma.

1088
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:28,645
There are security cameras outside.

1089
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:32,320
Jabbar's goons can monitor
everything in the surveillance room.

1090
01:50:32,355 --> 01:50:34,357
This was your brilliant plan?

1091
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:38,277
I had planted one bomb
in the there so that...

1092
01:50:38,312 --> 01:50:41,475
...we could destroy
all evidence as we escape.

1093
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:58,365
Karl!

1094
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,020
Check where the blast happened.

1095
01:51:00,055 --> 01:51:01,605
All positions... report in.

1096
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:04,519
Position 1, all clear!
Position 2, all clear.

1097
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,633
Position 3 come in...

1098
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:10,911
Position 3'?

1099
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,039
Ladies first.

1100
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,710
Position 3'?

1101
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:24,233
No reply from the
surveillance room, Jabbar.

1102
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:28,834
Don!

1103
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,685
Karl...

1104
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:33,600
Bring me his head.

1105
01:51:33,635 --> 01:51:35,750
Ulrich! Sven!

1106
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:51,519
Sven and Ulrich are dead.

1107
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:12,840
You're welcome.

1108
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,380
You are shot.

1109
01:54:16,415 --> 01:54:18,607
Merely grazed me.

1110
01:54:18,642 --> 01:54:20,800
Sorry.
- You okay?

1111
01:54:20,835 --> 01:54:23,125
We're good.

1112
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:25,880
Stay down.
I'm going to check on the others.

1113
01:54:25,915 --> 01:54:28,680
May I ask you something?

1114
01:54:28,715 --> 01:54:30,165
Yeah.

1115
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:33,955
What's the deal between you
and Arjun?

1116
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,599
He likes you.

1117
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:43,440
It's not difficult to understand
why he likes you.

1118
01:54:43,475 --> 01:54:45,165
And you...

1119
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:47,485
Do you like him'?

1120
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:52,325
I don't need to answer anything.

1121
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:57,080
You know what I think?
You don't like him...

1122
01:54:57,115 --> 01:55:00,320
...because you still love me.

1123
01:55:00,355 --> 01:55:03,077
I don't love you.

1124
01:55:03,112 --> 01:55:05,765
Just checking!

1125
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:08,880
Herman's dead.
And the bomb is still armed.

1126
01:55:08,915 --> 01:55:10,920
Karl, can you hear me?

1127
01:55:10,955 --> 01:55:13,445
Karl, come in...

1128
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:15,915
Ulrich... come in... God Damn it!

1129
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,005
Something is wrong.

1130
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:21,725
Jabbar... detonate the bombs.

1131
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:26,596
Let them know how it feels
to mess with us!

1132
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:38,274
Try the other one!

1133
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,080
It's not working...

1134
01:55:50,115 --> 01:55:52,879
Jabbar...

1135
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:01,334
Let her go, please!

1136
01:56:01,369 --> 01:56:03,189
Please don't kill her!

1137
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:07,285
Malik!

1138
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:11,720
If the helicopter isn't here in 5 minutes.
This poor woman will lose her life.

1139
01:56:11,755 --> 01:56:13,085
Vardhaan...

1140
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:15,880
2 hours aren't up yet.
20 minutes to go.

1141
01:56:15,915 --> 01:56:18,165
You're lying, Malik.

1142
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:20,400
When I throw this woman's body
out of the window...

1143
01:56:20,435 --> 01:56:24,800
...you'll know we weren't lying.

1144
01:56:24,835 --> 01:56:26,765
Jabbar, don't!

1145
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:30,060
The police didn't betray you, I did.

1146
01:56:30,095 --> 01:56:33,285
Let the woman go.
I'm coming there.

1147
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:37,520
Vardhaan, the helicopter
has left the airbase.

1148
01:56:37,555 --> 01:56:40,125
It will be here in ten minutes.

1149
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:45,155
Trust me! If you shoot,
I won't be able to help you.

1150
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,720
Ten minutes, Malik!

1151
01:56:48,755 --> 01:56:50,925
Don...

1152
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:55,557
Come here right now!

1153
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:00,685
Just a second.

1154
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:03,960
Philip needs medical help.
I think you should stay with him.

1155
01:57:03,995 --> 01:57:06,600
I'm going with Don, okay?!
Good luck.

1156
01:57:06,635 --> 01:57:08,045
Thanks.

1157
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:10,520
Roma, what are you doing?
It's not safe for you.

1158
01:57:10,555 --> 01:57:12,925
That woman needs me.

1159
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:15,440
But it's too dangerous.
Vardhaan and Jabbar can't be trusted.

1160
01:57:15,475 --> 01:57:18,720
It's my duty to get those hostages out.
So, come on..

1161
01:57:18,755 --> 01:57:21,685
Try to understand, Roma!

1162
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:25,350
If something were to happen to you...

1163
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:31,395
I'm coming with you.

1164
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:34,630
That's it. Let's go.

1165
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:45,697
Well, well, well!

1166
01:57:45,732 --> 01:57:48,194
What a happy reunion!

1167
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:49,925
Hello, Roma.

1168
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:52,805
Your weapons on the floor.

1169
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:56,515
I mean really!
Do I need to spell it out?

1170
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:05,590
Please remove your bullet proof vest.

1171
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,200
Vardhaan, the police is giving you
everything you asked for.

1172
01:58:11,235 --> 01:58:15,520
In return, at least let the women go.

1173
01:58:15,555 --> 01:58:17,365
No, not a chance.

1174
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:23,340
I've realised that women are...
more useful in these situations.

1175
01:58:24,475 --> 01:58:27,720
If we must let someone go...

1176
01:58:27,755 --> 01:58:30,277
Let it be Don.

1177
01:58:30,312 --> 01:58:32,765
Sorry?
- Don't be!

1178
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:37,245
<i>I want to kill Don and so does Jabbar.</i>

1179
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:42,240
And I'm sure you won't regret
if he is killed. Right?

1180
01:58:42,275 --> 01:58:44,117
Right?

1181
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:49,234
Give her the gun.

1182
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,276
Good.

1183
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,485
Now...

1184
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:09,672
...kill him.

1185
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,405
Amazing!

1186
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:24,751
Now I've seen it all.

1187
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:28,597
You seem to have cast
a spell on her, Don. SCRATCH

1188
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,518
Anyway...

1189
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:36,845
Let's try again. Jabbar!

1190
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:42,000
If she doesn't shoot Don
by the time I count three...

1191
01:59:42,035 --> 01:59:45,038
Shoot her!

1192
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:51,189
One...

1193
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,600
Pull the trigger, Roma.

1194
01:59:53,635 --> 01:59:55,445
Two...

1195
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:58,074
Shoot me, Roma!

1196
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,277
Three!
- Do it!

1197
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,036
So, both of you were under a spell.

1198
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:40,205
You're next, Don.

1199
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:42,640
Vardhaan, you seem to forget something.

1200
02:00:42,675 --> 02:00:43,845
What's that?

1201
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:47,600
Before Don's enemy
can make his first move...

1202
02:00:47,635 --> 02:00:51,753
Don has made his next move!

1203
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:22,005
Is everybody okay?
- Thank you!

1204
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:27,035
No. Not yet.
Stay right there! Please!

1205
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:30,917
Mr. Malik'?

1206
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:33,485
Malik here.

1207
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:38,120
Mr. Malik, Jabbar is dead.
And you won't have any issue...

1208
02:02:38,155 --> 02:02:41,097
...in taking Vardhaan back to prison.

1209
02:02:41,132 --> 02:02:44,040
The plates and hostages are with me.

1210
02:02:44,075 --> 02:02:45,965
So now...

1211
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:50,597
I hope you have the papers
for my immunity.

1212
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:55,480
We have the papers!
Very good, Mr. Malik.

1213
02:02:55,515 --> 02:02:58,040
Send them in...

1214
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:01,285
With Sameer!

1215
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:07,229
Sameer? ll want to see that
traitor one last time.

1216
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,005
She's alive.

1217
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:37,600
Bring the file here.

1218
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:49,834
Let him go! Now!

1219
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,205
You better find a safe hiding place.

1220
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:57,240
Because the day I find you...
you'll be dead!

1221
02:03:57,275 --> 02:04:00,517
You know where I live,
drop in any time.

1222
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:04,760
Of course! I know where you live.

1223
02:04:04,795 --> 02:04:07,752
Drop the weapon. Right now!

1224
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:27,432
That's him.

1225
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,920
What happened to Roma?

1226
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:39,596
Yours I believe...

1227
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,393
Do take care of her.

1228
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:46,270
Here! Hurry!

1229
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:55,325
Gentlemen...

1230
02:04:55,360 --> 02:05:00,160
is there anything else I can do for you?!
Where is the disc?

1231
02:05:00,195 --> 02:05:06,160
In the bag with the plates.
Can I leave now?

1232
02:05:06,195 --> 02:05:09,840
Once I check the disc... I
Of course.

1233
02:05:09,875 --> 02:05:15,518
And how long will that take?

1234
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:19,914
Take him away!

1235
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:22,515
Good night, everyone.

1236
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:27,314
Thank you.

1237
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,837
Check this out!

1238
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:13,680
What about these plates,
Mr. Diwan?

1239
02:06:13,715 --> 02:06:15,717
I'll take them.

1240
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:18,913
They need to be checked for damages.

1241
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:30,077
Is it good?IGood?
It's priceless, Mr. Malik.

1242
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:34,720
You want Mr Kohl to become president,
he will be the president.

1243
02:06:34,755 --> 02:06:36,320
That's my responsibility, Mr. Diwan.

1244
02:06:36,355 --> 02:06:38,516
Oh my God!

1245
02:06:55,600 --> 02:06:57,285
Remember I said

1246
02:06:57,320 --> 02:07:03,258
Don's enemies should always remember
that Don never forgets.

1247
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,120
The people who wanted to get rid of me,
are themselves in the docks now.

1248
02:07:12,155 --> 02:07:14,640
Jimmy Coogan, you are under arrest.

1249
02:07:14,675 --> 02:07:20,158
Jimmy Coogan and all his ilk.

1250
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:26,125
The police had to accept that it was

1251
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:30,279
because of my help that
Fabian Kohl was exposed.

1252
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:36,269
Vardhaan got back
to where he belonged.

1253
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:45,031
Now to take care of one last thing.

1254
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:49,765
Yes?
- Package for Mr. Ali'?

1255
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:53,270
Yes, that's mel
Please sign here, sir.

1256
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:56,039
Here you go.

1257
02:07:57,320 --> 02:07:59,311
Thanks
- Bye.

1258
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,380
Hello?

1259
02:08:14,415 --> 02:08:15,845
Don.

1260
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:18,759
I sent you a present.

1261
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:23,111
I hope you like it.

1262
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:14,791
I missed you sweetheart.

1263
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:22,818
Where is he?

1264
02:09:22,853 --> 02:09:25,076
He's right here.

1265
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:35,520
When I get out of the DZB,
hand me over to the police.

1266
02:09:35,555 --> 02:09:37,909
Sorry?

1267
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,085
Don't worry. It's part of the plan.

1268
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:45,750
This disc has all the
information and details.

1269
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:51,678
Here's what I want you to do with it.

1270
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:59,430
Check this out.

1271
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:07,077
The perfect crime!

1272
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:10,638
Plates please...

1273
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:45,790
Thanks.
- Bye.

1274
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:49,200
Everybody thinks the real plates
were destroyed in the blast.

1275
02:10:49,235 --> 02:10:54,752
But here they are with me.

1276
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:19,485
Now what?

1277
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:23,640
My enemies are either dead
or in prison.

1278
02:11:23,675 --> 02:11:27,760
And the police have nothing on me.
So now...

1279
02:11:27,795 --> 02:11:31,276
Now... lam a free man!

1280
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:34,765
What about Roma?

1281
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:37,679
Why did you have to save her life?

1282
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:42,605
Roma is like a bad habit.

1283
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:45,029
And it's not easy to give up a habit.

1284
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:48,925
Forget about her sweetheart.

1285
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:51,880
Imagine how rich we're going to be!

1286
02:11:51,915 --> 02:11:53,245
Really!

1287
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:56,193
I still can't believe you got out alive.

1288
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:01,685
Remember this...

1289
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:06,430
It's not just difficult to catch Don...
