1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,040
25.000

2
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:36,880
OCR and synch by ShooCat

3
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,080
'Cause he's an asshole!
Tell him no.

4
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,600
Tell him no, too.

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,280
Him,
tell fuck you.

6
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,280
No, I'll be here
a minute.

7
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,680
Got some guy coming up

8
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,560
who thinks he'll muscle me
out of my property.

9
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,000
Another tough guy,
that's all.

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,440
They're driving up.

11
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,520
Get their pieces.

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
Hmm.

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,640
We got a surprise
for these gentlemen.

14
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,240
Robert Durant,

15
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,720
you and your girls are going
to stand for a search.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,360
All right, move it.

17
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,320
There you go.

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,320
Oh, a bunch of cuties,
huh?

19
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,200
Just hold it
there, cueball.

20
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,480
Bum leg?

21
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,800
No leg.

22
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,680
I was engaged to a girl
with a wooden leg.

23
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,640
What happened?

24
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,240
Had to break it off.

25
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,280
All right, cut the crap.

26
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,160
I got three things
to say to you, Durant.

27
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
One,

28
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,200
I ain't selling
my property.

29
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,960
Two, nobody
muscles Eddie Black,

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
especially
a bunch of dinks.

31
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,040
And three, if y'alls
don't like that,

32
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,480
which I can already
see you don't,

33
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,320
we can cut
your balls off.

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,520
Maybe that would be
more satisfactory to you.

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,080
Ha ha ha ha!

36
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,440
Die!

37
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,720
Take them down!

38
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,120
Take him down!

39
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Take that one
with the goddamn gun!

40
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,160
Now...

41
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,560
let's consider
my points...

42
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,040
one by one.

43
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,640
One.

44
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,880
I try not to let
my anger

45
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,360
get the better
of me.

46
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,160
Two.

47
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,400
I don't always
succeed.

48
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,680
Three.

49
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,840
I've got seven
more points.

50
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,160
System ready
to receive input.

51
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,680
Just hold together,
you little...

52
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,400
shit.

53
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,920
Fragmentation.
Time?

54
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,360
99 minutes...

55
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,200
again.

56
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,840
Why?

57
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,800
Why, why, why?

58
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,320
Synthetic skin
data analysis...

59
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,040
What is
destabilizing it?

60
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,880
Why won't the liquid
skin last?

61
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,200
The vivification process
was easy.

62
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,320
Tissue rejection?

63
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,560
We licked that.
I know we're close.

64
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,920
We're smart guys,
so what is it?

65
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,960
Why can't we make
these cells stable?

66
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,760
What now?

67
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,600
Now?

68
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,840
Well...

69
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,120
we think it out again.

70
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,320
Patiently.

71
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,800
Objectively.

72
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,680
I don't care how long
it takes, Yakitito,

73
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,600
I know it's out there
waiting for us.

74
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,560
Ah, I can feel it.

75
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,320
God, I can almost
taste it.

76
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,080
Here she is... the
girl of your dreams.

77
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,720
Oh! Oh, Peyton!

78
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,160
Ah, you were sweet.

79
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,000
How's the skin coming?

80
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,840
Still won't last
past 99.

81
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,920
It'll happen. It will
happen, you know.

82
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,200
Ha ha ha!
Look at you.

83
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,960
Rebel without a clue.

84
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,200
Those were the days.

85
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,680
Hey...

86
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,040
What?

87
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,480
Come here.

88
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,480
What?

89
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,400
Come here.

90
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Oh, I know what's
on your mind.

91
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,880
God, you always wear

92
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
things that are
so difficult to...

93
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,760
Ta-da!

94
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,720
Oh, yeah!

95
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,040
Come on,
let's dance.

96
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,360
Herb Gorson, please.

97
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,720
Here you go, babe.

98
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,680
Peyton!

99
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,640
Oops. Sorry.

100
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,600
Yeah?

101
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,520
Herb, hi.
It's Julie Hastings.

102
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,880
Listen,
I found some memos

103
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,240
when I was researching
the Von Hoffenstein deal

104
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,120
that I don't think
I was supposed to find.

105
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,920
They're from Strack
to a guy named...

106
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,680
Claude Bellasarious.

107
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,120
They're records
of payments

108
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,520
to various people
on the Zoning Commission.

109
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,440
Well, I think
they're payoffs.

110
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,840
Yeah, well,
what I want to do

111
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,280
is talk
to Strack first,

112
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,200
give him the benefit
of the doubt.

113
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,480
Yeah, O.K.

114
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,400
All right, I'll talk
to you later, Herb.

115
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,360
Bye, Herb.

116
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
Oh, I don't want to go.

117
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,600
Don't go.

118
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
I have to go.

119
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,080
I have to go now!
I'm late.

120
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,000
Julie!

121
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,800
I'll call you
later.

122
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,960
Maybe.

123
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,320
Julie!
Julie, wait.

124
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,760
What is it?

125
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,960
I've been thinking.

126
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,960
Mm-hmm.

127
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,320
We should get married.

128
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,920
Marriage?

129
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,920
Uh-huh.

130
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I've just started
getting things going at the firm,

131
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,400
and I really like
having my own place.

132
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,160
We're practically
living together now.

133
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,360
All marriage means

134
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,800
is you answer the phone
in the morning,

135
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,200
and if
it's my grandmother,

136
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,640
you don't pretend
it's the wrong number.

137
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,520
The woman thinks
she has Alzheimer's.

138
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,200
I can't talk
about it now.

139
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,720
Jules, I'm asking you
to marry me.

140
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,200
Peyton, I love you...

141
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,160
I realized...

142
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,480
but I got to
think it over, O.K.?

143
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,040
Mr. Strack, I've been

144
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,480
going over
some documents.

145
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,800
I've come across
something

146
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,000
that puzzles me.

147
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,400
It's a memo
from your office

148
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
to a Mr. Claude
Bellasarious.

149
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,760
It details certain
payments that...

150
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,480
Yes, I know the memo.

151
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
It seems like
the payments were...

152
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,200
were payoffs
to the Zoning Commission.

153
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,080
Bribes, to call
a spade a spade.

154
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,520
Does that shock you?

155
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,920
No. I guessed as much.

156
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,840
You weren't supposed
to know about it.

157
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,240
That file was not
supposed to circulate.

158
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,560
However, I am asking you
to understand.

159
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,400
Take a look
at that model, Julie.

160
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,800
That's the dream...

161
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,200
acres of riverfront
reclaimed from decay,

162
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,120
thousands of jobs
created.

163
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,040
A building block,
a very large building block

164
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,440
laid for the future.

165
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,920
Not such a bad dream,
as dreams go.

166
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,800
And if the price
of realizing that dream

167
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,200
is the occasional
distasteful chore,

168
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,240
well, I don't run away.

169
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,280
I say so be it.

170
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,960
So...

171
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,720
want to book me?

172
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,120
The fact remains
that I'm in possession

173
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,680
of evidence of the
commission of a crime.

174
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,120
Let me suggest this...

175
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,560
you excuse yourself
for few minutes,

176
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,960
go to the ladies room
leaving your briefcase here.

177
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,360
What happens
to that memorandum

178
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,280
while it's
in my custody

179
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,720
is my responsibility.

180
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,080
I wish it were
that simple,

181
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,160
but I don't have
the memo with me.

182
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,920
I'm trying to protect you.

183
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,560
Does the name
Robert Durant

184
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,240
mean anything to you?

185
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,080
Drugs, racketeering...

186
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,480
and real estate.

187
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,440
Robert Durant is a competitor
for the riverfront.

188
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,240
He's a very
dangerous man, Julie.

189
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
I fully believe
he'd do anything

190
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,200
to get his hands
on that document.

191
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,280
DNA content...
acceptable.

192
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,720
Glucose...
right on.

193
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,200
We've
even checked

194
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,600
the collagen
congeners.

195
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,560
They're fine.

196
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,040
This is
unbelievable.

197
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,160
Every day,

198
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,480
it's a different
combination.

199
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,080
Time, Yakitito.
Time.

200
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,400
98 minutes.

201
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,960
Oh...

202
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
the circuit again.
I'll fix it.

203
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,120
I knew we pulled

204
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
too much juice
on that line.

205
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Yakitito, time.

206
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,200
Huh?

207
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,160
Time?

208
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,160
99.

209
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,920
100 minutes!

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,960
What? What?

211
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,640
The cells,
they're holding.

212
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
They're stable!

213
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,920
But, Dr. Westlake,
why now?

214
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,560
The dark.

215
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,800
Oh, of course.

216
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,000
The dark.

217
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,920
I think the
synthetic cells

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,360
are
photosensitive.

219
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,800
This is
unbelievable!

220
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,360
What is it
about the dark?

221
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,160
What secret
does it hold?

222
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,040
They're still
stable.

223
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,520
Time, Yakitito,
Time!

224
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,760
101 minutes.

225
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,040
Finally...

226
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,920
we can replace
damaged skin tissue!

227
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,160
No, Yakitito,
not quite, my friend.

228
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,520
We've just got
a piece of the puzzle.

229
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,960
There's still
the big question...

230
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,800
how to keep
the cells stable

231
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,440
past 99 minutes
in the light?

232
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,160
Now we know
it's all about light!

233
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,680
I'll get it.

234
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,760
No foolish heroics,
if you please.

235
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,160
We've come
only for documents.

236
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
Tell us where to find

237
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
the Bellasarious
memorandum,

238
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,440
and we shall disappear

239
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,360
like a nightmare
before the breaking day.

240
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,440
I don't know what
you're talking about.

241
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,880
Unfortunate.

242
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,840
What memorandum?

243
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,360
No, please.

244
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,480
We want
the memorandum.

245
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,360
Should your houseboy's
predicament

246
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,400
not jog your memory...

247
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,280
you may bid him
Godspeed.

248
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,760
He's a lab assistant.

249
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,360
For God's sakes,
let him breathe!

250
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,200
You heard the doctor.
Ventilate him.

251
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,160
No...

252
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,400
No!

253
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,520
Ooh! Ooh!

254
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,120
Bingo.

255
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Goody!

256
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Bring the Asian's fingers.

257
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,720
Gentlemen.

258
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,640
Rick, I'm proud of you.

259
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,040
Clean through the brain...
that's how I like it.

260
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,320
"Marry me?"

261
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,000
Didn't see you
doing much work.

262
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
That guy got
blown to pieces.

263
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,640
All they found
was an ear.

264
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,080
Tiny little
piece.

265
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,680
Didn't take long
to bury that.

266
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,520
You'll be all right.

267
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,200
You'll be all right.

268
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,680
We'll need
some sponges.

269
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,160
O.K., I got 'em.

270
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,680
Great.
We'll get ready.

271
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,680
Let's check
the eyes.

272
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,880
Get a gurney
in here.

273
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,440
Right there.

274
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,840
Straight in.

275
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,400
Next, we have
a 30, 35-year-old male,

276
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,160
no I.D.,
no medical history.

277
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,040
He was found
on the riverbank

278
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,520
just south of the city.

279
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,400
There are homeless
and indigents there.

280
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,320
We get three no-names
every week.

281
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,680
Nobody does anything until
they become train wrecks

282
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,160
like Mr. John Doe here.

283
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,600
He's got burns
covering 40% of his body.

284
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,240
The hands and face
are the most severe.

285
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,680
Ten years ago,

286
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,080
pain from the burns
would have been intolerable.

287
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,320
He would have spent
his life screaming.

288
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,480
Now we use
the Rangeveritz Technique.

289
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,680
Quite simply,

290
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,360
we sever the nerves within
the spino-thalamic tract,

291
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,760
there... which, as you know,
transmits neural impulses

292
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,160
of pain and vibratory sense
to the brain.

293
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,280
No longer receiving
impulses of pain,

294
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,120
you stick him
with a pin...

295
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,200
Ouch.

296
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,760
And he can't
even feel it.

297
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,280
As in many
radical procedures,

298
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,280
there are serious side
effects to this operation.

299
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,880
When the body
ceases to feel,

300
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,560
when so much
sensory input is lost,

301
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,720
the mind grows hungry.

302
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,560
Starved of
its regular diet of input,

303
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,880
it takes the only remaining
stimulation it has...

304
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,840
the emotions...

305
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,000
and amplifies them,

306
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,440
giving rise to alienation
and loneliness.

307
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,400
Uncontrolled rage
is not uncommon.

308
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,800
Now surges of adrenaline

309
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,200
flow unchecked
through the body and brain,

310
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,680
giving him
augmented strength.

311
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,080
Hence, the restraints.

312
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,960
Naturally, we give them
every chance of recovery.

313
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,920
Remain optimistic,

314
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,880
inspire confidence,

315
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,960
talk to him about
rehabilitation potential.

316
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,680
Personally, I give him a 9
on the buzzard scale.

317
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,640
Code blue, burn unit.

318
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,160
Doctor?

319
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,960
I'm in charge here.

320
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,560
Damn it,
let me through!

321
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,120
Ju... lie.

322
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,200
Julie!

323
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,720
It's...

324
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,200
me!

325
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,400
My lab.

326
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,040
All my work.

327
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,280
Oh, my God, no.

328
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,040
No! No!

329
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,280
No! No! No!

330
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,960
Hello, my friend.

331
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,760
Home.

332
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,440
Good. Good.

333
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,560
System re...

334
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,040
System... System ready
for digitization program.

335
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,640
Enter code.

336
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,360
O.K.

337
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Digitalization
in progress.

338
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,440
In progress.

339
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Insufficient data.

340
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,400
Oh, God.

341
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,760
Oh, no, please.

342
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,760
Please, no.

343
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,240
Quadrant A, Quadrant C

344
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,120
unrecognizable.

345
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
What am I doing
wrong?

346
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,200
What?

347
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,480
Yes.

348
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,440
Quadrants.
Quadrants.

349
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,880
Extrapolate.

350
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Yes.

351
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,360
Quadrant recognition
active.

352
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,520
Digitization
in progress.

353
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,880
Yes, that's it.

354
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,000
Clever, clever.

355
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,960
I must perfect the skin.

356
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,800
Wrong!

357
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,720
Wrong!

358
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,760
My hands.

359
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,000
They took...
They took my hands.

360
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,080
They... They took...

361
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,680
They took my hands!

362
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,040
Thank you for coming.

363
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,320
Julie... with what you've
been going through lately,

364
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,240
I, uh...

365
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,600
I haven't wanted
to bother you.

366
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,080
But I have to know

367
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,720
whether you've come
to a decision

368
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,160
regarding the Bellasarious
memorandum.

369
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,960
The decision's been
made for both of us.

370
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,000
The papers were
destroyed in the fire.

371
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,560
And I'd rather not
talk about it,

372
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,040
if you don't mind.

373
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,040
Julie, I'm sorry
I mentioned that.

374
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,000
Believe me,

375
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,960
I understand
how you feel.

376
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,400
I really do.

377
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,320
Unfortunately,

378
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,560
there's no cure
for grief.

379
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,000
But there is
something

380
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,480
that eases
the symptoms.

381
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,200
It's called dancing.

382
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,120
Would you, uh,
like a martini?

383
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,440
Yes.
I would love one.

384
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,040
Ventilate him.

385
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,400
His name's
Robert G. Durant!

386
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,120
I told you where
they make the pickup!

387
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,480
Oh, God! Don't!

388
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,800
I've told you
everything!

389
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,560
I know, Rick.

390
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,320
I know you did.

391
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,400
But let's pretend
you didn't!

392
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,600
Here you are, doll.

393
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,880
Here's your favorite.

394
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,360
How you doing, honey?

395
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,960
I'm pretty good today.

396
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,040
It wasn't that bad.

397
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,000
Hey, Pauly.

398
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,960
Hey, Pauly.

399
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,920
¿Que pasa?

400
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,880
¿Que pasa?

401
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,320
How are you, man?

402
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,760
Where's Rick?

403
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,400
Here's the cash, man.

404
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,600
Got you a gift,
huh?

405
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,880
You be good.

406
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,240
I'll see ya.

407
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,960
See you later, pal.

408
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,960
System ready for
digitization program.

409
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,560
Enter code.

410
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,080
Code... Code recognized.

411
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,720
Data entry required.

412
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,640
System standing by.

413
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,640
It's time.

414
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,240
Yeah.

415
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,840
Yo, Pauly.

416
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,040
Hey, Durant wants to know
where Rick is,

417
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,840
and he is hot.
I mean really hot.

418
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,280
Don't ask me why.

419
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,200
I know
he likes Ricky.

420
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,720
Pauly, do you know
where the hell Rick is?

421
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
Mmm-mmm.

422
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
You O.K., Pauly?

423
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,920
Yeah.

424
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,640
Here's the cash.

425
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,320
Pauly, we've been very
concerned about you.

426
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,760
Hey, Mr. Durant.

427
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,160
I must've overslept.

428
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,040
I'm sorry. I guess
I missed the pickup, huh?

429
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,440
Where's the money,
Pauly?

430
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,480
What money? L... I didn't
make the pickup.

431
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,560
Rio.

432
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,880
And first class.
How delightful.

433
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,200
And another one
for Rick.

434
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,360
Well. That explains
his disappearance.

435
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,800
Hey, I don't know
nothing about that.

436
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,520
Where is the money, Pauly?

437
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
What money?
I swear, Mr. Durant,

438
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,400
I didn't make
the pickup.

439
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,640
I've been here sleeping.

440
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,440
Jesus,
I swear to God.

441
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,480
Why... I don't even know
how I got dressed!

442
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,440
Well, Pauly...

443
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,160
have a nice flight.

444
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
Oh, God. What have I become?

445
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,560
What have I become?

446
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,320
Please.

447
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,800
Hold. Please hold.

448
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,160
Oh, just this once.

449
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,960
Oh, what?

450
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,960
What am I?

451
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,080
What am I, hmm?

452
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,560
Some kind of a circus freak?
Is that it?

453
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,280
Is that it? Huh?
Some kind of a freak?

454
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,680
Maybe I should wear
a funny little hat.

455
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,120
Do you like it?

456
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,240
Yeah? Yeah?

457
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,360
See the dancing freak

458
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,160
Pay five bucks

459
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,720
To see the dancing freak

460
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,800
Only five bucks

461
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,320
To see the dancing freak

462
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,640
Just five bucks

463
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,720
I'll give you a show!

464
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,600
I'll give you
a goddamned show!

465
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,200
Yeah!

466
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,240
I'll show you
I'm not a freak!

467
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,360
Yeah!

468
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,760
Oh, God.

469
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,840
Oh, Jesus, God.

470
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,800
Oh, keep a lid on it!

471
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,560
I'm a scientist.

472
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,480
Uh-huh. That's it.

473
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,000
Think objectively.

474
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,280
Analyze. Analyze.

475
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,960
Wait. Wait. That's it.

476
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,400
Control the rage.

477
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,840
Just...

478
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,280
take it easy, Peyton.

479
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,280
Just...

480
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,000
take it easy, boy.

481
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,400
I'm a scientist.

482
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,720
I'm a scientist.

483
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,240
Reconstruction program...

484
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,360
Reconstruction program complete.

485
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,240
Julie.

486
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,800
No.

487
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,360
It's all right, Julie.

488
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,760
It's me, sweetheart.

489
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,360
No.

490
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,760
Please, Julie, please.

491
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Don't be afraid.
Listen to me.

492
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,280
Who are you?

493
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,880
It's me.

494
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,040
Peyton.

495
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,680
You... are dead.

496
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,200
No, no, Jules. No.

497
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,080
I was in the hospital.

498
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,320
A coma.
Dead to the world.

499
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,360
Jules... please.

500
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,800
Please.
Please hold me.

501
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,600
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry.

502
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,720
I'm sorry. I didn't know
how to tell you.

503
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,160
I needed to see you.

504
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,200
I needed to know if things
could be the same.

505
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,600
Yes. But, Peyton,
I don't understand.

506
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,920
Shh.
I know it's a shock.

507
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,800
There's so much to it.

508
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,640
And I'll tell you
everything.

509
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,040
I just need
a little time.

510
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,960
Then just hold me,
Peyton, and don't let go.

511
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,040
I just... I just need
a little time.

512
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,040
I understand why
the doctors said

513
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,520
you shouldn't see me
after the coma.

514
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,160
That's their opinion.

515
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,440
What's yours?

516
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,200
I've got to have time

517
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,680
to work this out,
Julie...

518
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,160
on my own.

519
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,160
But where does that
leave us, Peyton?

520
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,280
I don't want to be
without you again.

521
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,240
I need you, too, Jules.

522
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,880
That's why I'm here.

523
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,480
It's just that I've...

524
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,360
I feel like a rag doll
all pieced together.

525
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,400
My insides
are on my outside.

526
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,320
If you could only see
how I feel inside.

527
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,680
I was ashamed. Afraid.
I was afraid

528
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,600
that you wouldn't
want me anymore.

529
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,200
Of course
I still want you.

530
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,840
Julie...

531
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,240
Julie,
what if I was hurt?

532
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,680
Like...
Like horribly scarred,

533
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,080
that you couldn't bear
to look at me

534
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,680
or have me touch you.
What then, huh?

535
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,800
Huh?

536
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,760
I don't know.

537
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,880
Honestly,
I don't know, Peyt.

538
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,400
But why do you
ask me that?

539
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,600
Look at you. You're fine.
And you're back.

540
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,240
Yes. I am back,
aren't I?

541
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,400
Just like always.

542
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,880
Yeah, what do you
want, buddy?

543
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,320
The name isn't Buddy.

544
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,800
It's Durant,
Robert G. Durant,

545
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,240
and I wish to speak
to Mr. Guzman.

546
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,200
O.K.

547
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,200
Thank you.

548
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,040
Rudy, some asshole's
on the phone for you.

549
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,440
Hey, Mr. Durant.

550
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,440
Ah, Rudy.

551
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,880
Pay attention.

552
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,280
Don't speak. Listen.

553
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,720
The funds Pauly
misappropriated

554
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,640
are beginning
to nettle me.

555
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,520
He's caused a serious
cash flow problem.

556
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,960
Did you receive

557
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,440
certain monies
from Chinatown today?

558
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,880
No, not today.

559
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,000
Unfortunate.

560
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,240
Then we shall have
to call upon Hung Fat.

561
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,080
Either he provides
the revenues owed to us,

562
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,960
or he becomes
part of my collection.

563
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,320
It would make
a nice addition.

564
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,680
Ha ha.
That's right.

565
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,080
You want me
to pick you up

566
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,400
at your place

567
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,680
tomorrow morning
around 8:30?

568
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,120
That would be...

569
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,360
just fine.

570
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,920
That would be...

571
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,480
just fine.

572
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,680
That would be...

573
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,880
just fine.

574
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,120
That would be...

575
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,400
just fine.

576
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,400
That would be...

577
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,680
just fine.

578
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,160
That would be...

579
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,400
Just fine.

580
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,920
Would you like a bag
for this, buddy?

581
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,360
That would be...

582
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,280
just fine.

583
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,720
Hey, hey,
take it easy, buddy.

584
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,120
My name isn't Buddy.

585
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,000
It's Durant.

586
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,960
Robert G. Durant.

587
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,880
Yes.

588
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,920
I'm Robert G. Durant.

589
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,200
Just fine.

590
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,400
Robert.

591
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,400
It's so good of you
to favor me

592
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,280
with your
venerated presence.

593
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,280
The money.

594
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,920
The money? Yes, Robert.

595
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,240
How I tremble
with shame.

596
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,160
I have no money.

597
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,040
How many times
do I have to tell you?

598
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,400
I was nowhere near
any convenience store!

599
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,280
They had the whole thing
on video.

600
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,680
Keep them
out of my hair!

601
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,920
You have to sign
those papers.

602
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,360
Where are you going?

603
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,560
Hong Kong Restaurant,
and fast!

604
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,160
White powder no longer flows
in its former volume.

605
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,040
All the members of Tong
languish in poverty.

606
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,920
Of all your
unworthy servants,

607
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,320
Hung Fat is
the most destitute.

608
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,720
Even my own
miserable slaves

609
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,280
sometimes ignore
my wishes

610
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,360
and upset those whom
I cherish most deeply.

611
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,880
So, until
that shining day...

612
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,120
may it soon come...

613
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,400
when I shall once again
honor you with offerings...

614
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,320
goodbye, Robert.

615
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,840
Robert, goodbye.

616
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,880
You will provide
the revenues owed to us

617
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,000
by the time
I finish this cigar.

618
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,320
But, Robert...

619
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,920
O.K., Bob, you win.

620
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,840
Damn! Drive!

621
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,760
Can't go no further.
Sorry.

622
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,200
It's a parade.

623
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,600
I'll get there myself.

624
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,560
What about
the fare?

625
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,640
Eat it!

626
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,680
Move!

627
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,800
Move it!

628
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,000
Where is he?

629
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,200
Where's who?

630
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,240
Guzman!

631
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,200
I thought
he was with you.

632
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,600
Shit!

633
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,640
Dios mio! ¿Que pasa?

634
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,120
There's two of those
son of a bitches!

635
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,040
Shoot him!

636
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,920
Shoot him!

637
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,240
Which one is Durant?

638
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,360
Not me, him!

639
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,280
Shoot him!

640
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,400
Shoot him!

641
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,440
Goddamn it!

642
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,320
Whose little boy are you?

643
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,400
It doesn't matter.

644
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,840
You're dead!

645
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,040
No, no. This one.

646
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,280
Don't just stand there.

647
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,400
Do something!

648
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,680
Son of a bitch sets
me up with the cops,

649
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,720
and you practically
hand him the cash.

650
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Madre mia!

651
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,080
Mr. Durant, I'm sorry.

652
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,080
Step right up and take
a spin on the amazing...

653
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,080
Come on!

654
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,600
One more!

655
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,600
Would you stop looking
at that watch?

656
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,840
To hell with time!

657
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,080
Forget about going
back to the hospital.

658
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,520
We're going to spend
the whole day together.

659
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,200
And the whole night.

660
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,440
I can't. I've got
my therapy group.

661
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,840
Peyton, we need
more time together.

662
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,880
Why are you so
uncomfortable with me?

663
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,960
All right, Jules.

664
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,600
Listen to me.

665
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,560
I got to tell you
something about me,

666
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,840
how I've...

667
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,520
changed.

668
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,000
When I was
in the hospital, l...

669
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,480
See the mutant man!
Half man, half beast!

670
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,240
Witness this cruel
accident of science

671
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,640
with your own eyes.

672
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,720
Everybody gather 'round
and look closely.

673
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,160
As you can see...

674
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,280
Peyt, what?

675
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,160
Peyton, what is it?

676
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,360
When I was
in the hospital...

677
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,800
was there
someone else?

678
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,120
No.

679
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,000
Yes. There was a man
who comforted me,

680
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,880
and I respected him
for his kindness,

681
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,280
but he means
nothing to me.

682
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,200
Is that what it was?

683
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,640
Was that it, Peyt?

684
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,520
God, I love you,
darling!

685
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,920
Oh, it's good
to be back.

686
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,360
Come on,
Julie Hastings,

687
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,240
I'm going to win
for you the biggest,

688
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,600
fuzziest, pinkest
doll on that rack.

689
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,520
Yes.

690
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,480
Then I
got to run.

691
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,920
You always
have to run.

692
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,680
Why is it always
so dramatic?

693
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,600
I have my hospital
sessions.

694
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,520
I'm not 100% cured yet,

695
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,120
but I soon will be.

696
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,360
Where is
this place exactly?

697
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,360
I want to be
involved somehow.

698
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,120
Can I take you there?

699
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,040
No. Please, Julie,

700
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,600
I don't want you
to see me there.

701
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,480
I don't want you to think
of me as an invalid

702
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,480
or some kind of a freak.

703
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,240
Uh, the pink
elephant, please.

704
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,360
It don't count unless
you're behind the line.

705
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,920
I was
behind the line.

706
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,640
Not hardly.

707
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,480
I was standing right
here with my girlfriend.

708
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,120
Now, the pink elephant,
if you please.

709
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,520
No way.

710
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,040
It doesn't matter,
Peyton.

711
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,280
It matters.

712
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,120
I won a pink elephant
for my girlfriend.

713
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,480
Why don't you
just, uh...

714
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,120
get lost, pal?

715
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,240
The elephant.

716
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,840
Quickly.

717
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,000
Didn't you hear me...

718
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,720
weirdo?

719
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,480
Scram.

720
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,920
Take it! Take it!

721
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,520
Take the fucking elephant!

722
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,160
Please, no!

723
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,640
Forgive me.

724
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,080
Peyton, wait!

725
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,520
Half man and a freak.

726
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,920
He's a freak,
ladies and gentlemen,

727
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,040
he's a freak.

728
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,600
A freak.

729
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,800
Peyton.

730
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,280
Peyton?

731
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,880
Synthetic skin
data analysis.

732
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:25,880
Amino acid content
equals 64%.

733
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:32,440
Membrane potential equals
122 megavolts.

734
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:41,720
Destabilization
registering at 99.008.

735
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,240
Why didn't you
tell me, Peyton?

736
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,160
You should have
told me.

737
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,680
You should have
come to me, Peyt.

738
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,880
You didn't
have to lie.

739
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,200
Peyton.

740
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,200
I would have tried
to help you.

741
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,000
I can help you now.

742
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,240
You don't have to hide
from me anymore, Peyt.

743
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,160
Julie.

744
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,040
Louis,
we have to talk.

745
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,600
Excellent.
I love to talk.

746
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,040
Brandy?

747
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,520
No.

748
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,960
I'll have one.

749
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,040
It's Napoleon,

750
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,840
and it's
quite good.

751
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,320
I can't see you anymore.

752
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,240
Honey, take it easy.

753
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,880
As you say,
let's... let's talk.

754
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,760
You know about Peyton,

755
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,160
the man I was
involved with?

756
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,080
Of course.

757
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,120
He's alive.

758
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,360
He's back.

759
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,040
I won't be a moment.

760
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,240
Yes?

761
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,640
Franz,
this is a bad time.

762
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,560
The closing price?

763
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,440
I think it's
sufficiently diversified.

764
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,320
It's immaterial to me
what the market's doing.

765
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,200
I want you to buy.

766
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,600
10,000 krugerrands.

767
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,040
Fresh ones.

768
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,080
Yes. The Bellasarious
memorandum.

769
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,960
I'm sorry you had
to find that, Julie.

770
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,920
Our relationship didn't
need this further strain.

771
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,240
You burned
Peyton's lab.

772
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,000
Not me personally.

773
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,840
I have an employee who does
certain things for me,

774
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,960
unofficially,
off the books.

775
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,800
Robert doesn't
like to pay taxes.

776
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,480
And now you'll kill me.

777
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,120
Hardly.

778
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,800
You have nothing on me.

779
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,720
You'd find the extremely
expensive police department

780
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,640
quite unsympathetic.

781
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,400
Julie, consider
the big picture.

782
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,800
Consider what
we're building here.

783
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,680
You and I,
we're building a city.

784
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:20,680
We can't let anything
get in the way of that.

785
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,280
Despite the way
things might appear,

786
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,720
you can't pretend

787
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,120
certain moments haven't
passed between us.

788
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,880
We still have that.

789
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,240
If you're not
going to kill me...

790
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,320
I have things to do.

791
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,800
I suppose this is
goodbye then.

792
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,800
Send Robert in.

793
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,200
Yes, Mr. Strack.

794
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,280
Robert, I have
good news and bad.

795
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:31,000
Custom dictates that you
render the bad news first.

796
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,840
We have a little problem
with Miss Hastings.

797
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,680
It appears she has
uncovered our alliance.

798
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,200
No problem at all.

799
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,400
And the good news?

800
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,000
Your wife died.

801
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,640
I'm joking, of course.

802
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,520
No. The good news
is that I know

803
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,280
who's behind our little
troubles of late.

804
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,040
When you retrieved
my memorandum,

805
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,880
you failed to excise
the good doctor.

806
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,000
Westlake?

807
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,920
He's extinct.
I saw to it myself.

808
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,600
He's alive.

809
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,920
I don't like
loose ends, Robert.

810
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,360
Finish it.

811
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,800
Where is he?

812
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,040
I believe we have a guide.

813
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,640
Julie!

814
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,920
Look out!

815
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,200
I think he's out here!

816
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,400
He just went
on the roof!

817
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,680
Julie!

818
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,000
Oh, you've got to be
shitting me.

819
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,920
Hey, Smiley, he went
into the warehouse.

820
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,400
He's in here.

821
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,680
This door!

822
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:22,320
System ready
for digitization program.

823
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,560
Data entry required.

824
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,040
Smiley, is that you?

825
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,600
Smiley.

826
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,160
Where the hell are you?

827
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,640
Close.

828
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,440
Chinga tu madre!
Smiley, is that you?

829
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,440
Don't shoot, Smiley!

830
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,480
It's Guzman!

831
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,440
Holy shit.

832
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,200
Good shooting.

833
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,280
Come here.

834
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,200
You... have...

835
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,240
been... a...

836
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,360
bad... boy.

837
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,040
Set it down.

838
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,440
Set it down!

839
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,880
I want anything done,

840
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,600
I guess
I'll have to do it myself.

841
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,800
O.K., Durant.

842
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,160
I'll take care of that...

843
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,960
Take it up!
Take it up!

844
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,040
Take it up!

845
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,480
Knock him off!

846
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,440
Get him off!

847
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,880
Oh, shit!

848
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,600
You're dead!
You're dead!

849
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,160
You're dead!

850
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,800
Holograph
recognition active.

851
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,680
Holographic imaging
complete.

852
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,560
You're next, Durant!

853
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,960
I'm coming for you!

854
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,800
Shake him.

855
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,200
What the hell was that?

856
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,840
Go after him!

857
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,440
I got him!

858
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,120
Get away!

859
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,800
Get back!

860
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,960
Get back!

861
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,720
He's mine!

862
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,360
Oh, shit!

863
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,960
Excuse me.

864
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,160
This is Police Air-12.

865
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,080
Set down the man gently
and land your craft.

866
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,080
Put down your craft!

867
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,920
Dip him.

868
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,040
Look out!

869
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,400
Watch it!

870
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,520
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

871
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,840
Damn!

872
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,800
Hold it steady.

873
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,720
What the hell's he up to?

874
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,400
Kiss your ass goodbye!

875
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,560
No! No!

876
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,120
Burn in hell!

877
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,640
You look like hell,
Robert.

878
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,640
That son of a bitch
Westlake

879
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,800
malfunctioned
my helicopter.

880
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,840
How terrible for you.

881
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,280
He's a cockroach.

882
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,920
You think
you kill him,

883
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,320
and he pops up
someplace else.

884
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,680
I expect
he'll pop up here soon.

885
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,400
See, I know
how he thinks.

886
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,520
I don't think
the world will grieve

887
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,280
over one less attorney.

888
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,120
It's the tragedy
of my life

889
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,000
that I have to kill
the ones I love.

890
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,280
My wife...

891
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,840
late wife...

892
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,760
held certain deeds.

893
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,960
I sent her on a plane
over the Smokies.

894
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,040
Let's just say

895
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:27,000
I landed on my feet.

896
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,000
I'm glad
you survived, Robert.

897
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,400
I'd hate to see your kids

898
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,480
deprived of a role model.

899
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,960
They do look up to me.

900
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,760
When I was young,

901
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,960
my father made me work
high steel.

902
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,880
Just me and the Indians.

903
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,280
No one else crazy enough

904
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,760
to run around up here
against the wind

905
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,640
at $4.50 an hour.

906
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,680
Call me crazy.

907
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,440
Sometimes I miss it.

908
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,160
Life on the edge.

909
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,880
Five inches wide,

910
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,400
650 feet down.

911
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,360
High steel!

912
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,160
Oh, by the way,

913
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,720
you don't have
any kids, Robert.

914
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,880
You truly are one
ugly son of a bitch.

915
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,800
What do you think,
Julie?

916
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,960
Who's the real
monster here?

917
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,240
I destroy to build
something better.

918
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,480
Whereas you,

919
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,440
you're a man
who destroys for revenge.

920
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,280
Look.

921
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,760
Look about you.

922
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,120
It's all mine.

923
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,560
Because I built it.

924
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,840
I built it all!

925
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:10,960
What have you got,

926
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,200
besides a little trouble
with your complexion?

927
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,280
I'm joking, of course.

928
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,040
A troubled conscience?

929
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,520
A little blood
on your hands

930
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,400
from what you
consider justice?

931
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,520
Justice.

932
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,960
You and I know

933
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,840
it's just another
word for what I do.

934
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,760
We should be
working together.

935
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,080
I could use
a man like you.

936
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,240
That's why
I brought you here.

937
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,040
You'll make lots of money
working for me.

938
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,360
If you still want her,
I'll throw in Julie.

939
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,160
Sound good?

940
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,640
Oops.

941
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,720
Pey...

942
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,760
Bitch!

943
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,720
Peyton!

944
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,720
Here you go!

945
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,280
Julie.

946
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,760
Peyton?

947
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,720
Come on.

948
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,320
You're going down,
Burn Head!

949
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,960
Oh, no!

950
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,520
Help me!

951
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,360
In your absence,

952
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:57,840
I've gotten to know Julie
quite intimately.

953
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,640
Her tastes are varied,

954
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,120
but I can tell you this...

955
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,200
she doesn't date freaks.

956
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,200
Peyton!

957
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,720
Julie!

958
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,080
Go ahead.

959
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,000
Do it.

960
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,280
Do it,
Westlake.

961
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,000
But think of this...

962
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,200
you let me die,

963
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,240
and you become
as bad as me. Worse.

964
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,120
You can't.

965
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,120
I know you too well.

966
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,000
Dropping me

967
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:14,000
is not really
an option for you.

968
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,040
It's not something
you could live with.

969
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,560
I'm learning to live
with a lot of things.

970
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,840
Don't look at me.

971
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,440
I want to look.

972
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,520
You'll perfect the skin.

973
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,960
You'll make it work.

974
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,360
It doesn't matter.

975
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,080
Julie...

976
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,640
don't you think
I told myself that,

977
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,080
night after
sleepless night?

978
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,520
It's just a burn.
Skin-deep.

979
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,040
It doesn't matter.

980
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,000
And if I covered it,

981
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,400
hid behind a mask,

982
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,600
you could love me
for who I was inside.

983
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,480
Without pity.

984
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:25,160
But a funny thing
happened.

985
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,520
As I worked on the mask,

986
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,440
I found the man inside
was changing.

987
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,600
He became wrong...

988
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,120
a monster.

989
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,560
I can live with it now,

990
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,240
but nobody else can.

991
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,000
I want our life back.

992
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,320
Peyton!

993
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,600
Peyton!

994
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,120
Peyton is gone.

995
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,520
Peyt?

996
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,320
Hey!

997
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,280
I'm everyone...

998
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,920
and no one...

999
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,560
everywhere...

1000
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,440
nowhere.

1001
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,160
Call me...

1002
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,040
Darkman.
