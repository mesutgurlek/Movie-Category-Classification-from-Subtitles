1
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Tension that had been brewing for
months in Nigeria exploded yesterday...

2
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,600
...as exiled Gen. Mustafa Yakubu
orchestrated a swift and violent coup...

3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
...against the democratically elected
government of President Samuel Azuka.

4
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,600
In the land with 1 20 million people
and over 250 ethnic groups...

5
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,500
...there'd been a long history
of ethnic enmity...

6
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,200
...particularly between northern Fulani
Moslems and southern Christian Ibo.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,600
The victorious Fulani rebels
have taken to the streets...

8
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,300
...as outbursts of violence
continue all over the country.

9
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,600
Thousands have been killed in
the fighting or executed thereafter.

10
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,500
Fearing ethnic cleansing, most Ibo
have abandoned their homes...

11
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,000
...and are fleeing the city or searching
for sanctuary wherever they may find it.

12
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,400
Gen. Yakubu has taken control
of most of the country...

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,400
...and appears firmly in charge.

14
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,400
There's no word on the United Nations'
reaction to the coup...

15
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,600
...but United States forces have already
begun to evacuate its embassy.

16
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,900
As you can see behind me,
on the USS Harry S. Truman...

17
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,500
...activity is high as foreign nationals
are evacuated from all over Nigeria.

18
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,300
This once peaceful country...

19
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,000
...has been rocked by a series of ethnic
unrests and brief but bitter battles...

20
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,500
...mainly over control
of Nigeria's vast oil supply.

21
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,000
However, nothing can prepare
the country...

22
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,600
...for the overwhelming and decisive
action that has just taken place.

23
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,000
We have just heard
that the entire presidential family...

24
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,500
...has been assassinated.
l repeat:

25
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,300
The entire presidential family
has been assassinated.

26
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,500
-Welcome aboard, Mr. Ambassador.
-Thank you.

27
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,200
Let me take those for you.

28
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,400
He got one in the leg!

29
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,500
Put him in the sickbay now!

30
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,200
Well, look at you.

31
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,100
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

32
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,400
We appreciate you've been humping out
there, but we have to put you back in.

33
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,500
Priority tasking. We need to extract
a critical personality ASAP.

34
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,000
Now get some chow,
refit for a three-day LLRP.

35
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,200
See you in chow to debrief.
You...

36
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,000
-...go see the medic.
-Aye, captain.

37
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,500
Attention on deck.

38
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,200
As you were, gentlemen. Sit down.

39
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,900
Everybody get chow?

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,200
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

41
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,500
Now, intel estimates
5000 Yakubu troops...

42
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,800
...scattered throughout this sector.

43
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,200
They've captured
government armories...

44
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,500
...and unfortunately, we have been
supplying them for far too many years.

45
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,700
ln addition, the local militia are killing
anyone who goes to a different church.

46
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,500
All right, now, your prime objective
is to find and extract...

47
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,400
...Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks with
lnternational Relief Services.

48
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,100
Dr. Kendricks is an American
by marriage.

49
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Her late husband
was Dr. John Kendricks.

50
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,900
Your secondary objective...

51
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,600
...is to extract two nuns and a priest
who run a feel-good near Yolingo...

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,700
...if they so choose to leave.

53
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,200
St. Michael's Mission, right here.

54
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,200
You will halo over Cameroon...

55
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,800
...and float into your DZ near the edge
of the Mazon Rain Forest.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
When you get your package...

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,500
...you will proceed
to your extract LZ Alpha.

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,700
Our presence on the ground
will be considered hostile.

59
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
-Questions?
-Sir...

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
...rules of engagement?

61
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,600
You will defend yourselves if you're
fired upon. Otherwise, do not engage.

62
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,800
Sir, what's our escape-and-evasion
plan?

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,400
Patrol the Cameroon border
through the Tandjile Pass.

64
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Anything else, gentlemen?

65
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
All right.

66
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,200
Dismissed.

67
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,300
Gentlemen, three minutes out.

68
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,900
lt's okay. lt's okay.

69
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,500
You speak English?
You speak English?

70
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,200
Good. Good.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

71
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Are there any soldiers here?
Any rebel soldiers?

72
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,900
You sure? You sure?

73
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,200
Good. Good. Can you take me
to Dr. Lena Kendricks?

74
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
Do you know who she is?
Okay, here we go.

75
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,500
Nice and easy. Come on.

76
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,500
Zee, we're moving.

77
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,500
lt's all right. l'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

78
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,100
Open.

79
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,300
Clear.

80
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,900
Lasana, where's that wa--?

81
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,200
These American men are here
to see you!

82
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,500
l'm Lt. Waters with the U.S. Navy.
l'm here to get you and your people out.

83
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,900
We're in the middle of surgery here.

84
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,400
Ma'am, you don't realize
what's about to happen here.

85
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Are you a nun?
Are you one of the nuns?

86
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
-Are you a nun, ma'am?
-Yes, sir.

87
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,200
Good. Pack your things
and let's get out of here now.

88
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,300
-Lieutenant!
-Ma'am.

89
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,000
Get those weapons out
of my operating room.

90
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
You're frightening my staff.

91
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,700
l'll be with you when l'm done.
Now please wait outside!

92
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,700
Your staff should be frightened,
ma'am.

93
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,300
Do you know what'll happen to you
and these women when rebels get here?

94
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Doc, maybe you can help her out.

95
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Ma'am, may l assist?

96
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,700
-Are you a doctor?
-No, l'm a corpsman, ma'am.

97
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,900
-Can you stitch?
-Yes, ma'am.

98
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,100
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, he's sure.

99
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,700
Then close for me.

100
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,500
We're taking our good old time here.

101
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,200
All right, Lt. Waters, l'm all yours.

102
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,500
Hurry up, Doc.

103
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,000
l assume you have a plan
to get us all out of here?

104
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,100
Yes, ma'am. Come with me, please.

105
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,600
We've got a 1 2-klick hike to make
to rendezvous to the helicopter.

106
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,000
Get your things together,
but pack light.

107
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,000
Zee, bring your perimeter up.
Keep Flea in place.

108
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,000
We spotted a rebel company
outside of Yolingo on the way in.

109
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,900
We must assume they'll be here
by night, if not sooner.

110
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
l'm responsible for 70 people here, more
than half of them seriously wounded.

111
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,000
My orders are to evacuate
foreign nationals only, ma'am.

112
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,700
What does that mean?

113
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,200
l mean nonindigenous personnel,
ma'am.

114
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
Then we have a problem.

115
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,400
l will not leave without
the indigenous personnel.

116
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,600
We're here to get you out.
Now, l suggest you go find the priest...

117
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,700
...go find the nuns, pack your things
and prepare to move.

118
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,200
When the rebel troops get here,
they'll kill everything they see...

119
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
...including privileged white doctors.

120
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,700
-What part of that plan don't you get?
-The Cameroon border's 40 miles away!

121
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,100
-You could fly them out in 30 minutes!
-Can't do that.

122
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,200
-Why not?
-Because my orders are very clear:

123
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,000
Evacuate the priest, you and the two
nuns. Now pack and get ready to move.

124
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,400
We can take those who can walk.

125
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,400
They're not my responsibility.
You are my responsibility.

126
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,400
You're right, lieutenant...

127
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,000
...it's not your problem.
lt is my responsibility...

128
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,900
...and l will not leave
without my people.

129
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,700
All right, give me a minute.

130
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
-A minute?
-That's right.

131
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,500
Sixty seconds. l suggest you use
that time to go find the priest.

132
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,400
Get Command on the horn.

133
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,000
Eagle One to Command.

134
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,000
-Lena, what's going on?
-l don't know yet.

135
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,000
Eagle One to Command.

136
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,800
Eagle One.

137
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,500
Yeah, captain, we got a problem.

138
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,700
No, we got her.

139
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,600
But she wants to bring the 70 people
here along with her.

140
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,700
Yes, sir, l understand.

141
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,500
l will handle it.

142
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,200
Eagle One, out.

143
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,700
Dr. Kendricks.

144
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,800
You win. Get your people together.
We leave in a half an hour.

145
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,100
There will be helicopters for them too?

146
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,700
Yes. We can only take those who can
move under their own power.

147
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,300
l understand.

148
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,300
Thank you, lieutenant.

149
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
Hurry, please.

150
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,500
Why don't we just get Doc
to trang her the fuck out?

151
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,300
That's a great idea, Red. Drugging
and kidnapping an American doctor.

152
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
l ain't sure this bitch is American.

153
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
The doctor is the mission, Red.
Stick with her.

154
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,100
-And we're taking all these people out?
-Go on.

155
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,400
We need everyone able
to travel ready to go.

156
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,100
We must leave guickly.
Quickly!

157
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
God will bless you, Lena.

158
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,300
-What did the captain say?
-What the fuck you think he said?

159
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay, let's clear these hooches.

160
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,300
Come here, you guys.

161
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,400
lt's okay. lt's okay. Come on.

162
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,600
Hour and a half off the rendezvous
with the bird.

163
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
-Can only bring what they carry by back.
-Roger that.

164
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,500
-Where's that priest?
-He says he ain't coming.

165
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,400
Bless you, Lena.

166
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,200
Thank you for everything.

167
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Don't cry, Sister, please.
We'll see each other again.

168
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,100
Take care of yourself.

169
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,800
-You got it, Lake?
-Hundred percent, sir.

170
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
All right. Let's go.

171
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,500
Take us out of here,
but don't run away from us.

172
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,300
Roger that.

173
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,000
Keep them moving. Keep them moving.

174
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,300
Come on.

175
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,900
Keep them moving, Slo.
Get her out of there.

176
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Hey. Come on, let's go.

177
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,500
-Come on, now.
-Catch up!

178
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,400
Sister Grace.

179
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,200
-The mother?
-She is dead.

180
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,100
Oh, no.

181
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,200
Oh, no.

182
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,600
What am l going to do
with this child?

183
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
Lena.

184
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,400
Lena, you'll have to take this child.
lt's the only chance she has.

185
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
We gotta move guicker than this.

186
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,900
We gotta get back for the Falcon game.
Come on.

187
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,100
Take care of yourself, girl.

188
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,300
Sister Siobhan.

189
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,900
Mind yourself.

190
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,700
Let's go, Sister. Pick your bag up.
Let's go now.

191
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,400
l'm not going.

192
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Sister!

193
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,400
-L.T., she doesn't want to leave.
-l'm not going.

194
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
What?

195
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,900
Good luck.

196
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,700
-God bless you.
-Thanks be to God.

197
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,500
All right, let's make it guick.

198
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,500
Come on, ma'am, let's go.

199
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,300
Come on. We have plenty of work
to do now. Come on.

200
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,600
Take care.

201
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,700
Go with God.

202
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,400
-God already left Africa.
-Yeah.

203
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,400
Go easy, doc. Watch your step.

204
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,500
l got her.

205
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,000
We're only five klicks in. lt's seven
and a half miles to LZ Alpha.

206
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,400
We go any slower, we'll start going
backwards in time.

207
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,500
-Red, what do you got back there?
-Five stragglers.

208
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,500
-30 meters and falling from main body.
-All right, roll them up ASAP.

209
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,800
Let's go.

210
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,300
Come on. You've gotta speed up.

211
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,700
Ma'am, speed up.
You too. You--

212
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,200
Watch those trees.

213
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,400
l'm gonna help you.

214
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,400
lt's all right. l'll tell them.

215
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,400
We got you.

216
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,900
Lieutenant.

217
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,500
We need to stop.

218
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,200
-Lieutenant!
-l heard you.

219
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,900
We can't stop.
Behind schedule. Come on.

220
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
These people need to rest.

221
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,900
And we have a child
who needs medication.

222
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,700
Here we go.

223
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,400
There you go, ma'am.
Let's go.

224
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
Let's go, doctor.

225
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,800
Come on, sir. Here we go.

226
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
What you want to do?

227
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,100
Rest for 30.

228
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,800
Lake, hold it up.

229
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,100
We're gonna rest for 30.

230
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,900
Set a perimeter.

231
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Perimeter up.

232
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Ma'am, we gonna take 30.

233
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,700
L.T., we got guerrilla rebels inbound...

234
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,700
...on our path.

235
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,500
Dr. Kendricks, come with me
right away. Come here.

236
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,600
There's danger on the trail. You must do
everything you can to-- Listen to me!

237
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,100
You must do everything you can to keep
that baby guiet, you understand me?

238
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,700
Whatever it takes. Go now.

239
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
Get up. Get up.

240
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,100
Danger close.

241
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,800
Go.

242
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,600
Clear.

243
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,700
Oh, fuck. L.T., straggler, straggler.
Danger close.

244
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,000
Go on, ma'am. Go.
Now is good. Go!

245
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,600
Lake, lead us out before they
realize their tailgunner's gone.

246
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,700
And find us a safe place to rest.

247
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Wait! They're going to the mission.
You have to stop them.

248
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,400
l can't do that. lt'd risk the safety
of all these people here.

249
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,600
-Besides, they may bypass the mission.
-You know they won't.

250
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,700
There are a lot of possible scenarios
that could happen, Dr. Kendricks.

251
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,600
l don't presume
to know them all. Red?

252
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,700
Dr. Kendricks.

253
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,600
-Let's go.
-Ma'am.

254
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,200
Come on.

255
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,100
Can't you sleep, lieutenant?

256
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,300
lt's my watch, ma'am.

257
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,300
You can call me Lena.

258
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,600
Dr. Kendricks, l suggest
you get some rest.

259
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,500
You know....

260
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,000
Thank you for saving my life.

261
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,900
lt wasn't about saving your life.

262
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,200
lt's about getting the job done.

263
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Completing the mission, that's all.

264
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,000
My dear...

265
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,500
...a thousand difficulties
don't make a doubt.

266
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,900
-But l'm not a good Catholic.
-You don't know that. Only God knows.

267
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,700
Gentlemen.

268
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,700
Please.

269
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,400
This is a house of God.
We have no soldiers here.

270
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,700
There are only sick people here.

271
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,800
Please, sir.

272
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
-Gentlemen, please.
-No! No!

273
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,000
No! Please! Please!

274
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,300
-No!
-No!

275
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,700
Commander, please.
This is a house of God.

276
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,300
We have no soldiers here. We have
hope. We have only sick people here.

277
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
We have only sick people here.

278
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,900
Please.

279
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
No, commander.

280
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,000
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

281
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,100
Holy Mary, mother of God...

282
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,000
...pray for us sinners
now at the hour of our death.

283
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,400
Commander, no!

284
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,400
-Blessed....
-No!

285
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,900
Holy Mary, mother of God....

286
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
What the fuck was that?

287
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,600
Hyena.

288
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,700
Flea, Lake, status?

289
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,800
Clear.

290
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Clear, L.T.

291
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,200
Zee?

292
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Star One, this is Eagle One.
Be advised on location.

293
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,100
This is Star One. My E TA,
your location, five minutes.

294
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,900
Popping smoke.

295
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,300
Do you have smoke?

296
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,500
Roger. Yellow smoke.

297
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,300
That's us.

298
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,100
Eyes on.

299
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,100
Slo, bring her up.

300
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,400
-Let's go! Come on! Now!
-Let's go, ma'am. Come on.

301
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,400
Let's go now! Come on! You're first!
Let's go!

302
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,200
Goddamn it, let's go! We're late.

303
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Come on!

304
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,200
Why doesn't the other helicopter
come down?!

305
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,800
lt's a gunship!
lt's here to protect us!

306
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,700
-What about the others?
-They'll be fine! Keep moving! Hurry up!

307
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,300
You gotta move faster!

308
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,400
-What are you doing?!
-Keep your head down!

309
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Stand back.

310
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,400
-Where is she going?
-Wait! Back!

311
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,700
Keep your head down!

312
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,000
-Let us go!
-Dr. Lena!

313
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,500
-Wait! Get back!
-Dr. Lena!

314
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,700
Answer me! You never planned
on taking all of us out, did you?

315
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,200
l simply follow orders! My orders are
to get you out! Get on the helicopter!

316
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,900
-What about my people?!
-l'm not here for them.

317
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,200
You lied to me!

318
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,200
You lied to me!

319
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,300
Liar! Bastard!

320
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,800
Lena! Let me go!

321
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,700
What about my people?!
l won't leave them!

322
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,700
You lied to me!

323
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,900
-They're gonna die!
-Secure the doctor.

324
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,700
Dr. Lena! Dr. Lena!

325
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,000
Who decides for me?! You?!

326
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,300
Your government?!

327
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,600
Bastard! l won't leave them!

328
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,200
Let's go! Let's go now!
Let's go!

329
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,600
Let's go! Go! Let's go!

330
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,000
Lena! Lena!

331
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Listen to me!

332
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,700
Listen to me! lt's okay.

333
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,400
Let's go!

334
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,800
Lt. Waters. Starboard side.

335
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,200
We saw this on the way in.

336
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,800
No!

337
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,700
No!

338
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,600
No!

339
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,300
-Doc!
-No!

340
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Come on.

341
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,000
Let's turn it around.

342
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,300
Musa.

343
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,300
Patience!

344
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,500
Lena!

345
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,500
We can only take 1 2 people.

346
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,800
Old, young, anybody
who'll slow us down.

347
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,700
We'll meet up again in Cameroon.

348
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,400
Go. And tell the others.

349
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,700
-God will bless you.
-Hurry, please.

350
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,700
Thank you.

351
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,700
Hurry, please.

352
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,100
Red!

353
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,900
Go with the package.

354
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Now, goddamn it!

355
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,700
What are you doing?

356
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,300
New mission?

357
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,400
No.

358
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,800
Same mission.

359
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,000
Get them ready, Zee.

360
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,800
God will protect you.
Take Mama's cross. Take Mama's cross.

361
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,700
Let's go! Get her ready.

362
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,600
We gotta go. We gotta go.

363
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,000
Let's go! Let's go. Come on!

364
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,900
Get her out of there!
Get off!

365
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,500
-Patience! She'll be safe.
-She's my baby!

366
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,700
Keep your head down.

367
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,500
She has no one to care for her.

368
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,400
Ma'am, you gotta take this baby!

369
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,800
Hold her tight!

370
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
-Keep your heads down!
-No more packs, sir. We're maxed out.

371
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,900
See you in Cameroon.

372
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,800
Come on. Let's go.

373
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,700
Here we go. Stay low.

374
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,100
Head down.

375
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,300
Let's go.

376
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,200
Sergeant! Let's go!

377
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,700
Eagle One, over.

378
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,400
Can you wait one, sir?

379
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,400
A.K.

380
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,900
Command.

381
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,300
Yes, sir?

382
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,900
Lieutenant, why is that bird full of
refugees and not your criticals?

383
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,000
The doctor wouldn't leave her people.

384
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,200
You can't get a woman on a helo?

385
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,500
She was on the bird.

386
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,800
-It's difficult to explain, sir.
-Oh, come on.

387
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,600
We're marching them to LZ Bravo.
Reguest helicopters to take them out.

388
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,500
Negative on the evac at LZ Bravo.

389
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,900
Come on, give me three choppers. l'll
have them in Cameroon in 20 minutes.

390
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,300
Negative!

391
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,200
Birds have taken heavy fire. We've
stopped entering Nigerian airspace.

392
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,400
We'll give you what help we can
from our end, but right now...

393
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,800
...you are on your own.

394
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,700
Man, l hope you know
what you're doing.

395
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,900
Me too, sir.

396
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,100
All right. We'll keep you advised
if the situation changes.

397
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Negative on the evac.

398
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,800
Come on. There you go. Come on.

399
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,900
Hang on to the knot, doctor.

400
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,500
-Come on.
-We got you.

401
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,500
Come on. Come on, doc.

402
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,600
Americans.

403
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,500
Some went in the helicopter.

404
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,800
Some went up the mountain...

405
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,800
...to Cameroon.

406
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,000
Slo.

407
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,400
Give me your chow, man.

408
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,600
l don't like roast beef anyway.

409
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,600
We're a little over 30 klicks
to the path to Cameroon.

410
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,000
Roger that.

411
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,500
What do you got?

412
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,800
We got a large body 1 0 klicks back,
bearing 3-6-0 and closing.

413
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,400
How strong?

414
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,500
Thirty, maybe platoon strength,
maybe more.

415
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,300
Rebels?

416
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,600
Could be.

417
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,600
Why would anybody be following us?

418
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,800
l don't know.

419
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,700
But we're gonna find out.

420
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,000
Good job.

421
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,500
-Keep an eye on them.
-Roger that.

422
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,800
-Sir?
-We got a problem.

423
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,500
We got possible hostiles on our 6.

424
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,500
Get them up, get them ready to move.

425
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,100
Roger that.

426
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,100
Dr. Kendricks, could you come with me,
please?

427
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,700
Thank you. lt'll just take a second.

428
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,800
-Do you know why anybody'd follow us?
-No, l don't.

429
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,300
You sure?

430
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,200
Yes, l'm sure.

431
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,000
-Think hard.
-l told you, l don't know.

432
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,100
Get your people ready to go now.

433
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,300
These people have been going
for over 30 hours.

434
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,300
Come on.

435
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,800
Red, help the doctor get ready to move.

436
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,000
How you doing?

437
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,400
The fuck you mean, how am l doing?

438
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,400
You know what l'm talking about.

439
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,700
You know as well as l do...

440
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,800
...that when we left that mission,
those people were dead.

441
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,900
And then we take 28 men, women
and children...

442
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,400
...and we hump for a day.

443
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,900
Zee, keep them moving.

444
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,300
Be with you in a second.

445
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,300
We get them to the LZ, and we leave
them behind to die like the others.

446
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,600
l'm confused.

447
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,500
And the boys are confused.

448
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,200
Get to the point.

449
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,500
Why'd you turn that bird around, L.T.?

450
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,500
Talk to me.

451
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,500
l'm with you either way.
You know that.

452
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,400
When l figure it out, l'll let you know.

453
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,300
This way.

454
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,100
-L.T.
-Go, Lake.

455
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,300
You're gonna want to come
take a look at this.

456
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,100
Get Dr. Kendricks up here. Come here.

457
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,700
We'll rest here for a minute. Stay down
in these trees. Listen to my men. Go!

458
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,900
Slo.

459
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,200
Stay down. Stay down.

460
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,600
Zee, Flea, with me.

461
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,100
What do you got?

462
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,400
Ringside seats to an ethnic cleansing.

463
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,800
How strong?

464
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,900
l counted seven so far, sir.

465
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,100
-Flea, get eyes on.
-Roger that.

466
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,100
There could be more in the hooches.

467
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,300
Bring them up.

468
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,700
Sir, we could go around them
to the north.

469
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,300
L.T.

470
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,200
Rules of engagement.

471
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,400
We're already engaged.

472
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,700
Hand me the binoculars.

473
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,200
Flea, you got the Zippo?

474
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
Roger that.

475
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,900
Zippo first.

476
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,800
Red Team, right flank. This way.
Edge of clearing. Wait for my go.

477
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,000
Silent and guick.
Gold Team, on me.

478
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,000
Silk, close up that back door.

479
