Hey!

25
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,880
Hey!

26
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:35,687
Come back here.

27
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:37,364
Hey!

28
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:39,763
Hey!

29
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:42,363
I hate that when you do that!

30
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:44,170
I was bored to death.

31
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:46,208
WeII, lwas having fun.

32
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:48,123
WeII, good for you.

33
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:50,328
- Get in!
- No, I'm grabbing a cab.

34
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:51,731
Get in!

35
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:53,404
Stop it!

36
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:55,483
Leave me aIone, Eddie.

37
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:59,403
Don't evertry that again...

38
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:01,969
or eIse!

39
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,849
Or eIse what?

40
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:47,525
Mr Yoshida says,
''We regret we can go no further.''

41
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:49,921
''This is our finaI proposaI.''

42
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:53,800
''Your company wiII benefit greatIy
from this new reIationship.''

43
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:56,850
''Now you must decide the fate of MicroCon.''

44
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:59,446
We shouId cIose at this price.

45
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:02,251
Let's see ifwe can hoId out
tiII Congress votes.

46
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:04,209
We can't puII backjust now.

47
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,283
DeaI's too far gone.

48
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,523
We can't puII backjust now.
DeaI's too far gone.

49
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:14,049
- They'll suspectifwe stall.
- They'II suspect ifwe staII.

50
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:18,171
Listen, I'm the Iast guy
who wants to screw this up.

51
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:22,165
DeaI's too good,
but we have to have some strategy.

52
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:24,971
That's whatl'm saying.

53
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:31,007
They're going to staII.

54
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:52,244
Hey, guys.

55
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:54,723
- How's it going?
- Good.

56
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:59,203
If there's anything you don't understand...

57
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,203
Oh, no. We're uh...

58
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,931
- We're fine.
- Great. That's good to hear.

59
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,242
You're gonna be part of a great team.

60
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:10,530
Once these guys draw
a Iine in the sand, that's pretty much it.

61
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:13,843
You want that research and deveIopment
money, don't you?

62
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:15,923
Nakamoto Group can do a Iot for you.

63
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,923
- Yeah, right.
- Great.

64
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:20,609
That guy is an asshoIe.

65
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:22,923
That guy is an asshoIe.

66
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:28,521
The deaI wiII put vitaI eIements of our
miIitary weaponry under Japanese controI.

67
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:32,002
Come on, Senator Morton.
That's reaIIy a scare tactic.

68
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:36,927
During the GuIfWar, the Japanese suggested
they couId deny us that weaponry. In fact...

69
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:39,924
- You're oversimpIifying a compIex issue.
- No...

70
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:45,644
He's trying to say America is Iooking for
a new enemy now the CoId War is over.

71
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:47,529
TaIk about simpIifying!

72
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,649
You're doing the simpIifying, Senator.

73
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:55,845
Hold on.

74
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:58,969
Let's let... Eleanor, let the Senatorin, please.

75
00:05:59,052 --> 00:06:01,043
l came here to Los Angeles because...

76
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:05,887
Before we hear that, l couldn't detect
exactly howyou're going to vote.

77
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:09,442
- You know, they warnedme aboutyou.
- Well, theyshould!

78
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,567
They should!

79
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:13,724
- Howare you going to vote?
- Against the sale ofMicroCon.

80
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:16,042
Thank you forsaying thatflat out.

81
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:18,202
Let me askyou guys on this side.

82
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:22,888
You sometimes make itsoundas if
Japan's prosperityis badforAmerica.

83
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:24,610
ls that whatyou mean?

84
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:29,720
The realissue is that this technology
is paidforbyAmerican taxpayers...

85
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:55,924
This discussion is degenerating
into the kind ofargument we don'tneed.

86
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:59,288
This is already a very tense situation.

87
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:02,250
There will soon be a vote
in Congress and we will decide

88
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:04,527
whether the MicroCon sale goes through.

89
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,407
I don't get you, Eddie.

90
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:14,483
So what?

91
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:30,603
Oh, Iadies, one thing.

92
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:36,126
Do remember that the custom here
is bow when you're bowed to.

93
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:39,650
Oh, wow!
They reaIIy roIIed out the red carpet.

94
00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:44,810
- What fIoor are we going to?
- 45th.

95
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:47,884
- After you, Greg.
- Thank you, Rick.

96
00:07:57,892 --> 00:08:00,486
Bow when you're bowed to.

97
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:03,962
- Oh, wow! Look at this. Everybody's here.
- This is amazing!

98
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:06,247
There's Barry Hirsch. The Mayor.

99
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:10,245
- We're in the fast Iane now.
- Oh, we sure are.

100
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:15,005
- Look, here's Yoshida-san and the boys.
- Get ready to bow.

101
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:19,131
Wife.

102
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:35,047
- Taiko drums!
- Huh?

103
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:39,887
Taiko drums. Long ago
they were used to drive away eviI spirits.

104
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,683
Come here.

105
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:26,043
No, here.

106
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:51,091
Yes.

107
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,243
Yes...

108
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:15,443
Yes... More...

109
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:17,523
Ah, yes...

110
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:21,126
Yo, what's up?

111
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:25,524
Web. Tom Graham. You're on the chart

112
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:27,603

The newNakamoto building. 1100 Figueroa.

114
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:33,563
- l can'tbelieve they're pulling this shit.
- What stuff?

115
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,564
Demanding to see
the fuckin' Special Services liaison.

116
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:40,531
They say the police can'tproceed
until you gethere.

117
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:44,127
And what time
was thatphone call from Lieutenant Graham?

118
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:46,203
What time?

119
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,842
Yes. What time was it?

120
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:50,923
9.00pm.

121
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,330
February 9th.

122
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,006
Four nights ago?

123
00:11:58,532 --> 00:12:00,523
Was that a yes, Lieutenant Smith?

124
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:02,762
Yeah. It's a yeah.

125
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:07,648
Lieutenant Smith,
we appreciate your cooperation.

126
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:11,771
You waived your right
to be represented here by an attorney.

127
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:16,846
So... Lieutenant Graham caIIed for
the SpeciaI Services Iiaison.

128

Is it normaI procedure now for the Japanese
to demand a Iiaison officer?

160
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,686
No. It's usuaIIy an assignment.

161
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,524
What time were you caIIed?

162
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:29,331
Lieutenant Graham caIIed at nine.
Hoffman caIIed in the car.

163
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:31,642
You were caIIed twice?

164
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:33,450
Yeah.

165
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,921
I wish I'd known that sooner.

166
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:41,481
Have you negotiated with the Japanese?

167
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,290
Negotiated?

168
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:46,762
Mm. Perhaps I can suggest the strategy.

169
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,888
WeII, this is hardIy a negotiation.

170
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:51,566
Oh? What is it, then?

171
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:55,369
What is it?

172
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:57,124
It's a homicide.

173
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:03,331
When we arrive,
you take charge ofthe negotiations.

174
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:05,642
Don't introduce me or refer to me.

175
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,007
Don't even Iook in my direction.

176
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:13,212
Keep yourjacket buttoned at aII times.
If they bow, you bow back.

177
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,806
BeIieve it or not, I have done this before.

178
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,883
You know, I do know these things.

179
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:20,247
Do keep your hands at your sides.

180
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:23,927
The Japanese find
big arm movements threatening.

181
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:26,443
Keep your voice caIm and even.

182
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:29,490
You'II probabIy find them irritating tonight.

183
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,291
But whatever happens,
don't Iose your temper.

184
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:34,328
I don't Iose my temper.

185
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,403
That's good to know.

186
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:39,131
When you start to get into troubIe...

187
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:41,123
I won't get into troubIe.

188
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:44,124
When you start to get into troubIe,

189
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,841
I wiII say, ''Perhaps I can be of assistance?''

190
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:50,922
From then on, ldo the taIking.

191
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:54,561
You stand behind me.
And don't appear distracted.

192
00:16:54,652 --> 00:16:59,203
We may come from a fragmented,
MTV, rap-video cuIture, but they do not.

193
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:04,127
Every aspect ofyour appearance
and behaviour wiII refIect on you,

194
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:06,851
the Department, and me as your sempai.

195
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:08,923
My sempai?

196
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:11,128
That wouIdn't be massa, wouId it?

197
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:19,721
No. The sempai is the senior man
who guides the junior man, the kohai.

198
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:25,605
In Japan, the sempai-kohai reIationship
is presumed to exist

199
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:28,764
when the younger man and the oIder man
work together.

200
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:31,844
HopefuIIy, they wiII presume that of us.

201
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:42,647
So what does it mean
that I was caIIed twice?

202
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:44,723
It means they're ahead of us.

203
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:47,849
For aII they know,
I couId have been five minutes away.

204
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:51,971
They know who was on caII tonight,
how Iong it wouId take you to get here.

205
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:54,043
They know aII about you.

206
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:56,123
- AII about me?
- Mm.

207
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:00,126
- It took you Iong enough.
- Tom.

208
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:05,168
What the fuck's he doing here?

209
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,402
Fred Hoffman toId me to bring him.

210
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:09,483
The guy is troubIe. Watch out.

211
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:13,451
The Department put him on Ieave
because he's too cIose to Japan.

212
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:16,604
- He's not a team pIayer.
- Where is everybody?

213
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:19,081
They made us put our cars around back.

214
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:22,960
They keep saying
nothing must disrupt the grand opening.

215
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:26,408
Finding that bIonde piece of sushi
drove them nuts.

216
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:29,484
Don't want their guests or the press to know.

217
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:33,483
Step aside, paI.

218
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:36,726
- You come down aIready.
- Yeah?

219
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:38,723
WeII, now I go back up.

220
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:42,088
Maybe come down, go up 10 times more. OK?

221
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:49,645
We're stiII the fuckin' poIice
in our own country.

222
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:53,566
BuiIt this buiIding in six months.

223
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:58,168
Prefab units from Japan, sIapped 'em
together here. Not one American worker.

224
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:01,244
City gave 'em an eight-year break
on property taxes.

225
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,607
Shit! We're giving this country away.

226
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,444
Nobody forced us to do it.

227
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:10,884
Jesus!

228
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:15,329
If an eIevator's gonna taIk, it shouId
speak in American. What did it say?

229
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:18,051
We're arriving at the 45th fIoor.

230
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:21,165
No, no. Wait a second.

231
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:26,007
The Japanese provide jobs here,
but US companies are moving jobs offshore.

232
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:28,083
Ground fIoor, pIease.

233
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:30,163
- They must...
- Going up, Senator.

234
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,801
- No, no. I wish to go down.
- Get the next one, Senator.

235
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:35,883
Come on.

236
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:41,762
No, no, no. You don't understand!

237
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:44,804
Senator Morton.

238
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,486
ReaI nice to find him partying here,

239
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:52,282
considering he's on the committee
which sets aII import reguIations.

240
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,803
Geronimo!

241
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:58,403
Coming through!

242
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:17,207
I have your Iiaison for you.

243
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:30,524
Is this your home phone, Detective?

244
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,930
Yes. Right there at the bottom.

245
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:36,845
Detective, Iet's dispense with the formaIities.

246
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:40,447
We'd Iike to cooperate,
but you can't start without a warrant.

247
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:44,161
- BuIIshit. We don't need one.
- We can get one in 15 minutes.

248
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:48,325
- But we do have a reported homicide here.
- More IikeIy a drug overdose.

249
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:50,642
We can't know that untiI we investigate.

250
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:52,131
ObviousIy.

251
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:56,888
But I'm concerned about the attempt
to Iink this death to our reception downstairs.

252
00:20:56,972 --> 00:21:00,965
I don't know, sir.
Looks Iike she's wearing a party dress.

253
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,690
She is, I agree.

254
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:06,651
Lieutenant, you have to appreciate
the position ofthe Nakamoto Corporation.

255
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,724
- Sir, I...
- This is an important evening for us.

256
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:11,803
A very pubIic evening.

257
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:16,010
We don't want it marred by the death
of a woman of no importance.

258
00:21:16,092 --> 00:21:18,242
- Of no importance?
- You have some nerve!

259
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:21,688
- I can't imagine how she came to be in here.
- You have some nerve!

260
00:21:21,772 --> 00:21:25,003
Your Lieutenant Graham intends
to interrogate everybody,

261
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:27,652
the Mayor, the Senators, and Congressmen.

262
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:29,768
Graham said that?

263
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:33,731
Oh, Christ! What is this?

264
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:35,882
Do you mind turning around?

265
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:38,805
- Who is he?
- Mr Tanaka works for Nakamoto Security.

266
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:42,282
- Get him outta here!
- We have authorised him to be here.

267
00:21:42,372 --> 00:21:46,081
I'm authorising him out!
He's contaminating the area. And get his fiIm!

268
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:51,405
- We must undertake our own private inquiry.
- I'II get you a warrant and a restraining order!

269
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:53,881
Do that! Be my guest!

270
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:58,364
Excuse me.
Perhaps uh... I can be of assistance.

271
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:26,767
Ishihara-san, I'm sure none ofyour guests
are invoIved in this unfortunate incident.

272
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:28,843
They are free to go as they wish.

273
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:32,560
I am gratefuI for your assistance.

274
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:37,282
But before they Ieave, give me
the names ofthose gentIemen, pIease.

275
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:39,690
I'm sorry.

276
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:42,491
The names ofthose gentIemen.

277
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,003
May I ask why?

278
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:56,882
- Ritchie! Mugshots! AII ofthem!
- You cannot do this!

279
00:22:58,332 --> 00:23:00,641
No! You are to bIame here!

280
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:02,927
You wiII assist my detectives!

281
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:05,401
And I want to know who discovered the body!

282
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:08,763
And don't you fuck with me!

283
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:14,684
But of course,... Captain.

284
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:20,003
Yeah, don't fuck with us.

285
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:23,641
Mount up, boys. Let's get it done
before she starts to smeII.

286
00:23:23,732 --> 00:23:28,726
- Isn't it bad form to Iose your temper?
- It is. But I had to, to assist Ishihara.

287
00:23:28,812 --> 00:23:30,484
Assist Ishihara?

288
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,961
Now why wouId you wanna do that?

289
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:35,520
He wasn't the most important man
in the room.

290
00:23:35,612 --> 00:23:38,001
- Oh, he wasn't?
- No. It was the oIder man.

291
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:40,967
His juyaku, his superior.

292
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:46,809
But I wanted to get the investigation going
so I pIayed the out-of-controI gaijin.

293
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,167
So Ishihara wouIdn't Iose face.

294
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,130
So now, Ishihara owes me a favour.

295
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:00,443
Deep, isn't it?

296
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:02,523
Heavy.

297
00:24:11,212 --> 00:24:13,601
The executive fuck chamber.

298
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,925
Oh, man, I Iike this! I Iike this!

299
00:24:17,452 --> 00:24:19,886
That's nice. That's nice.

300
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,850
These guys sure know how to do business.

301
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:47,043
HoId that.

302
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:50,567
Her nostriIs Iook Iike
a margarita gIass rim.

303
00:24:50,652 --> 00:24:53,803
- Think she OD'd on coke?
- I don't think so.

304
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,885
We'II get Iab vaIues on aII fIuids.
Some seminaI fIuid down here.

305
00:24:57,972 --> 00:25:00,361
ExternaI genitaIs are pretty raw.

306
00:25:00,452 --> 00:25:05,242
It Iooks Iike forced intercourse,
but I'm not sure she was murdered.

307
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:08,927
Not sure she was murdered?
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.

308
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:13,403
The make-up on the neck
covers signs of prior throat injuries.

309
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:16,450
That suggests a pattern
of repeated cervicaI trauma.

310
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:18,807
CouId be a case of sexuaI asphyxia.

311
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,689
She's a gasper.

312
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:22,763
Which is what?

313
00:25:22,852 --> 00:25:27,209
IndividuaIs sexuaIIy aroused by
the hypoxia of near-stranguIation.

314
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,888
They ask their partners to strangIe them
or suffocate them during sex.

315
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:34,691
It's easy to make a mistake and go too far.

316
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:38,003
This Iooks Iike death from inhibition to me.

317
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:41,562
- Instantaneous physioIogicaI death.
- Meaning what?

318
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:43,768
The person just... dies.

319
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:45,843
Happens with neck or chest injuries.

320
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:49,368
Had a kid got hit with a basebaII.
FeII down dead in the schooIyard.

321
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:51,886
Yeah. Maybe she got hit with a basebaII.

322
00:25:51,972 --> 00:25:53,963
Odds are she was strangIed.

323
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,203
But since having sex isn't a feIony,
it wouIdn't be murder.

324
00:25:57,292 --> 00:26:00,921
Anyway, fiIe in the back ofyour mind
that maybe she just popped off.

325
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:05,563
CheryI Lynn Austin. Age 23.
This says she has a Westwood address,

326
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:08,485
but she hasn't changed
her Kentucky Iicence yet.

327
00:26:08,572 --> 00:26:11,564
Japanese cigarettes and credit cards.

328
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:16,444
Nice tight roII of $100 biIIs.
Miss Austin's weII taken care of.

329
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:18,682
These IittIe guys eat shit in Tokyo.

330
00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:21,809
Crammed into subways,
working for big companies.

331
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:24,167
They come here and they're rich and free.

332
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:26,447
They aII want to fuck a Rose BowI queen.

333
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:30,241
And then kiII the Rose BowI queen
on the Nakamoto boardroom tabIe?

334
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:33,324
CaII the poIice and create a scandaI?

335
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:36,803
Is that your theory?

336
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:38,883
- My theory?
- Mm.

337
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:43,011
My theory is that these guys
are known perversion freaks.

338
00:26:43,092 --> 00:26:45,242
I got a nose for these things.

339
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:47,323
I'm sure.

340
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:53,247
Hey, Spider-san.

341
00:26:53,332 --> 00:26:55,323
TeII your paI they got a contest.

342
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:57,880
Whoever kisses the most asses
wins a Toyota.

343
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:02,367
Hey, Graham! Want some sushi?

344
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:05,649
Nah. If I get a craving for mercury,
I'II eat a thermometer.

345
00:27:06,932 --> 00:27:10,322
In Japan, criminaIs expect to be caught.

346
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:13,327
Convictions run about 90%.

347
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:18,171
Here, it's cIoser to 171/2%.

348
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:21,122
They think we're stupid.

349
00:27:21,852 --> 00:27:24,047
They think we're corrupt.

350
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:26,521
And they're not often wrong.

351
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:39,683
What the heII are you doing?

352
00:27:39,772 --> 00:27:42,161
Good evening, offiicers. Can lhelp you?

353
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:44,527
Yes, you can. Where are you Iocated?

354
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:49,049
- Lobbylevel. Across from the elevators.
- Thank you.

355
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:51,930
How Iong have you been on duty tonight?

356
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:54,003
About haIf an hour.

357
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:56,970
Mr Tanaka was here when I got here.

358
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,282
Mr Tanaka? Who's Mr Tanaka?

359
00:27:59,372 --> 00:28:01,363
He's the head of security.

360
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:05,882
Mr PhiIIips, the 46th fIoor, the cameras?

361
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:09,248
I know in Japan
they Iike to observe their workers

362
00:28:09,332 --> 00:28:11,971
to heIp them improve their efficiency.

363
00:28:12,052 --> 00:28:15,647
I saw at Ieast four up there. Why so many?

364
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:25,641
You didn't hear this from me.

365
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:29,249
I guarantee we didn't hear it from you.

366
00:28:30,532 --> 00:28:35,731
Maybe they put in a coupIe of new cameras
to observe those negotiations.

367
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:38,406
What negotiations were those?

368
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:41,891
The ones that go on up there during the day

369
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:44,486
with a company caIIed MicroCon.

370
00:28:44,572 --> 00:28:47,564
MicroCon. The computer chip company?

371
00:28:47,652 --> 00:28:51,122
There's a vote coming up
in Congress on that deaI.

372
00:28:52,452 --> 00:28:54,443
Put up the 46th fIoor.

373
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,440
Can the camera get in cIoser?

374
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,604
- You have to use the gizmo.
- The gizmo? Show me.

375
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:14,283
You, uh, use the gizmo... to zoom in.

376
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:18,604
This is aII next-generation. There is
nothing Iike this in this country... yet.

377
00:29:18,692 --> 00:29:20,683
You record by disk?

378
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:23,127
Record? What do you mean, record?

379
00:29:23,212 --> 00:29:25,123
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:29:25,212 --> 00:29:27,601
The disks are aII back there.

381
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:35,323
It's aII there on next-generation Iaser disk.

382
00:29:44,092 --> 00:29:47,129
I'd Iike to see tonight's disk for the 46th fIoor.

383
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:54,685
You'd have to taIk with my supervisor.
You got a warrant?

384
00:29:58,452 --> 00:30:01,922
These disks record for 12 hours.

385
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:06,882
Why does the one on the 46th fIoor
onIy show two hours?

386
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,963
Excuse me?

387
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:15,201
The originaI disk isn't even here,
anyway, is it?

388
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:17,681
Because it's been repIaced.

389
00:30:19,612 --> 00:30:21,887
I wouIdn't know about that.

390
00:30:21,972 --> 00:30:24,645
That's Mr Tanaka's department.

391
00:30:25,332 --> 00:30:28,529
Someone at this very moment is watching us.

392
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:34,885
Under the circumstances,
you've been more than heIpfuI.

393
00:30:34,972 --> 00:30:38,362
I'd Iike to teII you officers something.

394
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:40,443
This is a good job.

395
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:45,048
Around here, if something doesn't work,
I got a probIem,

396
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:47,521
I teII somebody, they fix it!

397
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:52,409
It's not Iike when I was working
at GM out there in Van Nuys.

398
00:30:52,492 --> 00:30:55,484
- This is different here.
- You're part of a team.

399
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:58,450
What, a team? What are they doing for you?

400
00:30:58,532 --> 00:31:01,285
They spotting for you?
Sending you in pIays, huh?

401
00:31:01,372 --> 00:31:03,363
Maybe they got instant repIay...

402
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:06,683
Hey, brother, come on!
These peopIe have been good to me.

403
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:10,401
Kohai, I'm gonna caII in a favour.
Stay here with Mr PhiIIips.

404
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:12,289
Come on, kohai.

405
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,647
Lieutenant Smith.

406
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,967
Don't fuck with these guys.

407
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:53,685
Hey, the honeys are out tonight.

408
00:31:53,772 --> 00:31:57,162
Oh, here's a nice one. Let's use the gizmo.

409
00:31:57,252 --> 00:31:59,243
Oh, yeah, she's nice.

410
00:31:59,492 --> 00:32:01,483
Not so nice.

411
00:32:01,812 --> 00:32:03,803
She's my ex-wife.

412
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:07,561
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

413
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:10,086
Don't be. She's a Iawyer.

414
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:14,168
It must be nice to fuck a Iawyer

415
00:32:14,252 --> 00:32:16,846
instead of aIways being fucked by one.

416
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:21,610
I've seen your friend
around here quite a bit.

417
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:23,728
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.

418
00:32:23,812 --> 00:32:26,121
ReaI friendIy with Mr Yoshida there.

419
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:28,521
And who's Mr Yoshida?

420
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:31,602
Mr Yoshida's the man!

421
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:33,683
Let's Iisten in.

422
00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:39,843
l knownothing ofthis.

423
00:32:39,932 --> 00:32:42,526
Any recordings we have
are yours to examine.

424
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:44,603
l will look into itimmediately.

425
00:32:52,052 --> 00:32:54,043
What does that mean?

426
00:32:54,132 --> 00:32:56,600
Massa wants me to get the car.

427
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:09,125
Senator Morton, you said
if the saIe of MicroCon is approved,

428
00:33:09,212 --> 00:33:12,443
they wiII controI the market
and use the technoIogy

429
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,727
to compete against our own companies.

430
00:33:14,812 --> 00:33:17,884
You know that there is a time and a pIace
for business,

431
00:33:17,972 --> 00:33:22,887
and tonight I just want to say
that our hosts threw one heck of a gaIa.

432
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:26,442
But, Senator, you've said,
''Look what happened to our TV industry.''

433
00:33:26,532 --> 00:33:29,968
- Is there such a thing as off-duty?
- Let's wrap it up.

434
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:32,441
Hey, you! Quit Ioafing!

435
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,648
Get the Senator's car! We're waiting.

436
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:36,962
No! You get the Senator's car.

437
00:33:37,052 --> 00:33:39,691
Wrong guy. Wrong fuckin' century.

438
00:33:40,692 --> 00:33:43,081
Penguin-Iookin' motherfucker!

439
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,608
Let me smack this asshoIe.

440
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:52,571
Captain Connor!
Remember me? Bob Richmond.

441
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:54,643
Myers, Lawson and Richmond.

442
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:58,361
I understand my Nakamoto guys
got a IittIe frazzIed tonight.

443
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:00,841
If I can be of any heIp to you,

444
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:02,923
I'm avaiIabIe.

445
00:34:03,052 --> 00:34:05,043
That's comforting.

446
00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:07,563
AsshoIe!

447
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:12,328
I knew him when he was a government
trade negotiator deaIing with the Japanese.

448
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:13,845
Now he's working for them.

449
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:15,923
Like I said,... asshoIe.

450
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:41,846
HeIp you?

451
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:43,843
CheryI Lynn Austin.

452
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:46,571
- She not in.
- Yeah, I know.

453
00:34:47,892 --> 00:34:49,484
Keys.

454
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:01,207
Room two.

455
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:21,523
The doorman's Yakuza.

456
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:25,321
I noticed his tattoo. I didn't know
there were so many Yakuza in America.

457
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:28,563
This isn't America.
This is that shadow worId.

458
00:35:28,652 --> 00:35:31,849
They have bars, cIubs and... bettaku.

459
00:35:33,692 --> 00:35:38,641
Bettaku. Love residence
where mistresses are kept.

460
00:35:38,732 --> 00:35:41,121
- This is one, huh?
- Correct.

461
00:35:41,212 --> 00:35:43,203
Here we are.

462
00:35:51,772 --> 00:35:53,922
What time did it start raining tonight?

463
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:56,003
After nine.

464
00:35:57,332 --> 00:35:59,448
Someone was here after nine.

465
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:02,603
Correct.

466
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:14,403
Look at this.

467
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:21,203
She's with Eddie.

468
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:23,044
You know him?

469
00:37:23,132 --> 00:37:25,248
Mm. Eddie Sakamura.

470
00:37:49,732 --> 00:37:51,529
What's this?

471
00:37:56,052 --> 00:37:59,522
GirIfriend was into some different shit.

472
00:38:04,692 --> 00:38:06,523
Look.

473
00:38:06,612 --> 00:38:11,242
What is with this guy? There's a Iot
of pictures of her with your friend Sakamutu.

474
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,323
- Sakamura.
- Whatever.

475
00:38:18,372 --> 00:38:21,569
Somebody's taken photos from here recentIy.

476
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,362
Oh... I thought I heard Eddie's voice.

477
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,683
Say,...

478
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:38,242
- Why is everybody in CheryI's room tonight?
- Everybody?

479
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:40,323
WeII, you and...

480
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:43,085
Aren't you just a IittIe bit off Iimits here?

481
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:44,685
And who are you?

482
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:46,763
Me?

483
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:49,803
WeII, I'm JuIia.

484
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:54,001
I'm just a IittIe neighbour girI
who Iives down the haII.

485
00:38:54,092 --> 00:38:56,083
Are you CheryI's back-door man?

486
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:58,049
And what if I am?

487
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:01,043
WeII...

488
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:03,248
If you are,

489
00:39:03,332 --> 00:39:05,323
I heard ofyou.

490
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:10,205
You better watch out
cos Eddie, he's the reaI jeaIous type.

491
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:13,170
They don't caII him Crazy Eddie for nothing.

492
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:16,164
ReaIIy? WeII, I'm kinda tough.

493
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:18,243
Mm, weII,

494
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:20,562
tough as you may be,

495
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:25,687
Eddie finds out,
then you're gonna be crying.

496
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:32,083
Um, say,

497
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:34,163
is CheryI aII right?

498
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:36,243
No, she isn't.

499
00:39:36,612 --> 00:39:38,603
Lieutenant Web Smith. LAPD.

500
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,289
I knew he was gonna do something to her.

501
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:46,011
I heard him screaming at CheryI.

502
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:50,927
Shouting things Iike, ''I'II kiII you'',
before he took her to that party tonight.

503
00:39:52,652 --> 00:39:56,201
Many thanks, miss.
Someone from my office wiII contact you.

504
00:39:58,172 --> 00:40:01,130
I knew he was gonna do something to her.

505
00:40:02,452 --> 00:40:03,851
Kohai.

506
00:40:06,092 --> 00:40:08,083
You know, Web...

507
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:13,849
Eddie's father is a big industriaIist
over there at Daimatsu.

508
00:40:17,412 --> 00:40:20,210
He has a... a friend he sees.

509
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:23,049
Jeanette.

510
00:40:23,132 --> 00:40:25,521
Right up here on the second fIoor.

511
00:40:27,812 --> 00:40:30,007
You know how Eddie met CheryI?

512
00:40:33,052 --> 00:40:34,883
WeII,

513
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:39,363
she was working in that Toyota pIant
back there in Kentucky.

514
00:40:40,252 --> 00:40:42,243
Then one day,

515
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:47,330
who shouId show up
in that smaII, IittIe town...

516
00:40:49,052 --> 00:40:51,043
but Eddie.

517
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:57,523
Web...

518
00:41:22,972 --> 00:41:26,203
She was about to give up the murderer,
and you just waIk away.

519
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:30,046
Maybe I've been bought off by the Japanese.

520
00:41:30,132 --> 00:41:34,364
Sempai, appIe pie, whatever I have
to caII you,... we have a murder here.

521
00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:37,125
I want to soIve it,
not Iisten to true confessions.

522
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:39,203
You know what's true?

523
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:42,887
When something Iooks too good
to be true, then it's not true.

524
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:46,009
Everything she said about Eddie
might have been true.

525
00:41:46,092 --> 00:41:48,560
The reaI question is
why was she saying it?

526
00:41:48,652 --> 00:41:50,847
OK! Why was she saying it?

527
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:52,809
I'm not sure.

528
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:56,730
Because she thought
Eddie kiIIed the girI!

529
00:41:56,812 --> 00:41:59,372
This JuIia accidentaIIy waIked in...

530
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:03,047
Nothing is happening accidentaIIy.
She's a messenger.

531
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:07,444
- Oh, you think someone sent her?
- Mm.

532
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:09,409
OK. Who?

533
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:11,403
The bad guys.

534
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:14,802
And I suppose they sent her in
to find out what we know.

535
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:17,565
Or to teII us what they wanted us to know.

536
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:19,643
Or maybe to sIow us down.

537
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:22,602
She certainIy sIowed you down.

538
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:23,966
BuIIshit!

539
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:27,089
BuIIshit?
Never underestimate your opponent.

540
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:29,640
Never take what he offers you.

541
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:32,202
You want to soIve this crime?

542
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:34,248
- Yes.
- WeII, so do I.

543
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:35,481
Now Iet's move.

544
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:41,803
Come on, Eddie!

545
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:54,647
DarIing, those days are gone from your Iife.

546
00:42:57,012 --> 00:43:00,402
I couId dance Iike that. I'm an oId
song-and-dance man from way back.

547
00:43:00,492 --> 00:43:03,404
Oh, yeah? Wanna teach me some steps?

548
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:19,729
- It's by invitation onIy, gentIemen.
- Mr Sakamura.

549
00:43:19,812 --> 00:43:23,088
- Mr Sakamura is not here.
- That's him. The bad tap-dancer.

550
00:43:24,612 --> 00:43:27,172
Mr Sakamura is not avaiIabIe.

551
00:43:27,252 --> 00:43:31,370
Mr Sakamura is a good friend of mine.
I'm sure he's avaiIabIe for me.

552
00:43:32,052 --> 00:43:35,203
GentIemen, you're trespassing.

553
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:39,888
Now, unIess you have a search warrant,
you'II have to Ieave.

554
00:43:40,812 --> 00:43:43,485
You shouId know I'm a bIack beIt.

555
00:43:43,572 --> 00:43:46,132
- But of course you are, dear.
- Need heIp, Perry?

556
00:43:46,212 --> 00:43:47,884
So is Jeff.

557
00:43:51,652 --> 00:43:54,041
OK, feIIas. You're Ieaving.

558
00:43:56,852 --> 00:43:58,843
That's assauIt.

559
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:01,723
I don't wanna hurt you.

560
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:12,922
They say ifyou must resort
to vioIence, you've aIready Iost.

561
00:44:13,012 --> 00:44:14,843
What do you think, Jeff?

562
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:17,685
I think I'II go get Mr Sakamura.

563
00:44:21,652 --> 00:44:24,212
- Ah, Captain Connor!
- Eddie.

564
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:30,284
My father wiII be happy to hear
you're stiII up to your same oId tricks.

565
00:44:30,372 --> 00:44:32,363
We're here to taIk, Eddie.

566
00:44:33,012 --> 00:44:35,048
So taIk. It's a free country.

567
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:38,329
It's about the murder at Nakamoto tonight.

568
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:40,607
WeII, Iet's taIk outside.

569
00:44:47,012 --> 00:44:49,446
Yeah. I heard about that. Some poor girI.

570
00:44:49,532 --> 00:44:51,329
You know her, Eddie.

571
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:54,283
CheryI Austin.

572
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:57,011
Oh, yeah, CheryI. Mm. That girI.

573
00:44:57,892 --> 00:44:59,883
Too bad.

574
00:45:00,972 --> 00:45:03,440
I hear she was a reaI hentai onna.

575
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:05,409
You knew her better than that.

576
00:45:05,492 --> 00:45:08,245
You're putting her up at the ImperiaI Arms.

577
00:45:08,332 --> 00:45:11,642
Oh, that CheryI. Oh, I know her reaI weII.

578
00:45:11,732 --> 00:45:14,963
- She was aII over me, Connor-san.
- You're irresistibIe.

579
00:45:15,052 --> 00:45:17,043
That's true, but...

580
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,441
Connor-san, she had a big probIem.

581
00:45:19,532 --> 00:45:23,081
She was a sick girI. She Iiked pain.

582
00:45:23,172 --> 00:45:27,290
Put a pIastic bag over her head,
aIways saying, ''Squeeze harder.''

583
00:45:27,372 --> 00:45:30,364
Squeeze the neck? You Iike that, do you?

584
00:45:30,452 --> 00:45:32,443
Me? No!

585
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:35,251
I'm a straight meat-and-potatoes man.

586
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,607
Don't Iet 'em see you Iike this. Get up!

587
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:40,968
- Did you see her tonight?
- Tonight? Me?

588
00:45:41,052 --> 00:45:44,522
Maybe for two minutes at the party.
Just to say heIIo.

589
00:45:44,612 --> 00:45:47,604
Mr Sakamura,
I think you'd better come with us.

590
00:45:51,012 --> 00:45:53,128
Yeah, I saw her tonight.

591
00:45:55,692 --> 00:45:57,808
I brought her to the party.

592
00:45:57,892 --> 00:46:00,360
But I have nothing to do with it.

593
00:46:00,452 --> 00:46:04,240
Look, I can prove it to you.
Just Iet me caII you Iater.

594
00:46:04,332 --> 00:46:06,800
I wiII bring you something.

595
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:09,884
- I think that's a bad idea.
- Captain.

596
00:46:09,972 --> 00:46:12,122
Nakamoto is keiretsu.

597
00:46:12,212 --> 00:46:15,329
My father is Daimatsu keiretsu.

598
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:20,406
If his son is arrested here,
there wiII be repercussions.

599
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:23,768
Business is war. I know you understand.

600
00:46:35,372 --> 00:46:37,363
Do you have your passport?

601
00:46:37,452 --> 00:46:39,443
Yeah, sure.

602
00:46:42,492 --> 00:46:44,483
Give him your card.

603
00:46:44,572 --> 00:46:46,563
And you caII him, Eddie.

604
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:50,291
Connor-san!

605
00:47:01,412 --> 00:47:04,324
- I sure hope you know what you're doing.
- Me, too.

606
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:06,403
He's guiIty as heII.

607
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:09,052
WeII, my dairokkan says he's not.

608
00:47:09,132 --> 00:47:11,726
I hope your intuition is right.

609
00:47:23,052 --> 00:47:24,963
Look, sempai,

610
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:29,045
my dairokkan teIIs me your dairokkan
wasn't why you Iet Eddie go.

611
00:47:30,252 --> 00:47:33,244
In Japan, his father saved my Iife.

612
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:36,243
And Eddie reminded you ofthat?

613
00:47:36,332 --> 00:47:38,402
He wouId never remind me.

614
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:41,086
It's my responsibiIity to remember.

615
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:44,403
So what is aII this buIIshit
about his father's keiretsu?

616
00:47:44,492 --> 00:47:47,131
BuIIshit? There's a keiretsuwar going on.

617
00:47:47,212 --> 00:47:50,409
A Japanese corporation never stands aIone.

618
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:55,612
A keiretsu is a united front
of hundreds of powerfuI companies,

619
00:47:55,692 --> 00:47:58,206
aII acting in partnership to win.

620
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,566
To win what?

621
00:47:59,652 --> 00:48:01,643
Whatever's there.

622
00:48:01,732 --> 00:48:04,405
You ever hear ''business is war''?

623
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:07,523
The war is never over.

624
00:48:07,612 --> 00:48:10,729
Maybe you heard
''AII's fair in Iove and war''?

625
00:48:10,812 --> 00:48:12,370
No.

626
00:48:12,452 --> 00:48:14,841
- So where does that Ieave us?
- Us?

627
00:48:16,412 --> 00:48:18,403
We're in the war zone.

628
00:48:35,052 --> 00:48:39,364
So, based on the Iab resuIts,
the guy who fucked her was Japanese.

629
00:48:39,452 --> 00:48:41,443
Semen anaIysis is bIood type AB.

630
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:45,491
Diego factor positive.
Negative for ethanoI dehydrogenase.

631
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:48,882
Asian pattern.
MaIe pubic hair aIso Asian in origin.

632
00:48:48,972 --> 00:48:52,089
Evidence points to a Japanese perpetrator.

633
00:48:52,172 --> 00:48:54,242
It's a Jap perp aII right.

634
00:49:04,972 --> 00:49:06,963
What the heII's this?

635
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:12,643
Looks Iike your guy confessed.

636
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:15,041
No. It's just Sumimasen.

637
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:20,001
If they're caught doing something wrong, to
get Ieniency, they must perform an apoIogy.

638
00:49:20,092 --> 00:49:22,481
- You mean it's an act?
- Not exactIy.

639
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:25,370
He's genuineIy scared
you'II create a scandaI.

640
00:49:25,452 --> 00:49:30,207
Yoshida-san insisted that he find
the missing disk and deIiver it to us.

641
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:31,964
Yeah, good Iuck.

642
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,249
That disk is probabIy
in a Tokyo IandfiII by now.

643
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:43,403
What the heII's this?

644
00:49:43,492 --> 00:49:45,483
Daytime. 46th fIoor.

645
00:49:45,572 --> 00:49:48,644
Negotiations for MicroCon.
Semiconductors.

646
00:49:48,732 --> 00:49:50,723
Hey, can we skip the cartoons?

647
00:49:50,812 --> 00:49:52,803
HoId on. We're just starting.

648
00:49:57,332 --> 00:49:59,323
Richmond-san. Busy, busy.

649
00:49:59,412 --> 00:50:01,767
Hey, Iet's go. Get to it!

650
00:50:01,852 --> 00:50:04,241
Night-time. Same pIace.

651
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:07,163
Looks different then.

652
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:10,843
Jesus! It's her.

653
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:21,004
HeIIo.

654
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,843
Come on in.

655
00:50:39,572 --> 00:50:41,563
He Iooks Japanese.

656
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,363
Maybe he's PoIish.

657
00:50:47,852 --> 00:50:50,525
He's checking to see
if she's carrying a gun.

658
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:52,682
Someone's using the gizmo.

659
00:50:52,772 --> 00:50:55,332
Gizmo. He's sure using it on her.

660
00:51:06,652 --> 00:51:09,120
There go the hands to the neck.

661
00:51:09,212 --> 00:51:11,203
Just the way she Iikes it.

662
00:51:32,532 --> 00:51:35,000
Hey, Mr Nice Guy. Turn around.

663
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:41,843
Oh, no! Don't teII me
he's gonna waIk out in the dark.

664
00:51:42,252 --> 00:51:44,561
No! Step into...

665
00:51:44,652 --> 00:51:47,769
There! Back it up!

666
00:51:52,132 --> 00:51:53,724
There.

667
00:51:53,812 --> 00:51:56,087
That's right, I knew it aII aIong.

668
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:58,322
- I was right about this.
- Eddie.

669
00:51:58,412 --> 00:52:00,368
You know this fucker?

670
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:02,010
Eddie Sakamura.

671
00:52:02,092 --> 00:52:03,844
We had him tonight.

672
00:52:03,932 --> 00:52:07,766
- What do you mean, you had him?
- We had him. We Iet him go.

673
00:52:08,732 --> 00:52:12,805
- I kept his passport.
- His fuckin' passport? Jesus!

674
00:52:12,892 --> 00:52:15,247
Get his ass, not his passport!

675
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:20,087
What are you waiting for? You want banzai
carved on her ass with a samurai sword?

676
00:52:20,172 --> 00:52:23,050
Let's go get this Eddie Sock-It-To-Me.

677
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:27,444
I'm gonna break your arms, my friend.
I'm gonna Iove breaking them.

678
00:52:28,932 --> 00:52:30,923
Come on, Web!

679
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,082
The oId guy sucker punched me.

680
00:53:04,972 --> 00:53:07,247
If I see him again, he's dead meat.

681
00:53:07,332 --> 00:53:09,562
Oh, forget it.

682
00:53:18,652 --> 00:53:21,724
Good evening, Jeff. Mr Sakamura in?

683
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:29,643
Easy, big feIIa.

684
00:53:37,812 --> 00:53:39,882
Just Iike oId times, Web.

685
00:53:39,972 --> 00:53:42,805
Do you miss it? A night out with the boys?

686
00:53:43,452 --> 00:53:47,206
- Sure beats aII that dipIomacy shit.
- I thought no vioIence.

687
00:53:48,172 --> 00:53:50,163
Last thing we want.

688
00:53:50,252 --> 00:53:52,641
The guy's a murderer, Spider-san.

689
00:53:52,732 --> 00:53:54,723
LAPD takes no chances.

690
00:53:54,812 --> 00:53:57,326
Yeah, but we do take prisoners. Right?

691
00:54:00,372 --> 00:54:02,522
Why did Connor Iet this guy waIk?

692
00:54:02,612 --> 00:54:04,603
I can't say.

693
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:07,243
What is he about?

694
00:54:08,052 --> 00:54:10,612
He's aIways carefuI not to offend their...

695
00:54:10,692 --> 00:54:13,081
What is it we're not supposed to offend?

696
00:54:13,172 --> 00:54:15,163
Fuck 'em, they break the Iaw.

697
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,641
If that brands me as a reactionary...

698
00:54:17,732 --> 00:54:21,008
- We're in position. Standby.
- Moving in.

699
00:54:22,252 --> 00:54:24,641
Is reactionary a dirty word?

700
00:54:24,732 --> 00:54:26,723
Like racist, or something Iike that?

701
00:54:26,812 --> 00:54:30,851
AII this taIk of race.
Whatever happened to good and eviI?

702
00:54:30,932 --> 00:54:32,923
A guy did it, you catch him.

703
00:55:22,492 --> 00:55:25,802
PIundering our naturaI resources.

704
00:55:25,892 --> 00:55:28,326
Fuckin' guys are into everything!

705
00:55:37,332 --> 00:55:39,323
What time you got, Web?

706
00:55:40,452 --> 00:55:42,443
2.10.

707
00:55:42,852 --> 00:55:47,323
Make a note.
At 2.11, suspect was apprehended.

708
00:55:47,412 --> 00:55:51,166
Eddie Sakamura caIIing. It's urgent.
I must speak about missing disk.

709
00:55:56,412 --> 00:55:58,403
PoIice! Get down!

710
00:56:00,372 --> 00:56:02,090
Stay where you are! Get down!

711
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:03,844
Don't move! Get down!

712
00:56:03,932 --> 00:56:05,923
- You guys, out the back!
- You son of a bitch!

713
00:56:06,012 --> 00:56:08,003
What the heII? Get off of me!

714
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:10,325
There he goes!

715
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:12,323
Ow, shit!

716
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:14,528
What the heII is wrong with you? Get off!

717
00:56:15,492 --> 00:56:17,687
You're nuts! Get off of me!

718
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:20,003
Get that son of a bitch!

719
00:56:22,892 --> 00:56:26,248
- I'm a poIice officer!
- You're a piece of shit!

720
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:05,843
8-Adam-65.

721
00:57:05,932 --> 00:57:08,002
Am in pursuit of187 suspect,

00:57:10,172 --> 00:57:14,563
All units, standby.

723
00:57:17,052 --> 00:57:19,930

00:57:25,372 --> 00:57:27,567
Stay back, l wanthim alive.

725
00:57:28,452 --> 00:57:30,443
HoIy shit!

726
00:57:38,092 --> 00:57:40,083
Damn! Damn, damn, damn!

727
00:57:42,132 --> 00:57:44,726
Coroner's officiaIs have taken possession

728
00:57:44,812 --> 00:57:48,282
of the charred remains
identified as Mr Edward Sakamura.

729
00:57:48,372 --> 00:57:50,203
The crash took pIace after...

730
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:52,487
We tried to take him, but he ran, Chief.

731
00:57:52,572 --> 00:57:56,247
Burnt beyond recognition. The guy's a cinder.

732
00:57:56,332 --> 00:57:59,005
You got proofthat Sakamura
committed the murder?

733
00:57:59,092 --> 00:58:03,165
- AbsoIuteIy. Got it aII recorded. Right?
- AbsoIuteIy.

734
00:58:04,092 --> 00:58:06,083
You did everything by the book?

735
00:58:06,172 --> 00:58:08,322
By the book. AbsoIuteIy, Chief.

736
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,243
AbsoIuteIy.

737
00:58:11,332 --> 00:58:14,529
But everything was not
absoIuteIy by the book.

738
00:58:16,012 --> 00:58:18,003
AbsoIuteIy not.

739
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:20,890
And when did you discover this?

740
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:36,201
Yeah.

741
00:58:36,286 --> 00:58:38,197
- Lieutenant Smith?
- Yeah.

742
00:58:38,286 --> 00:58:40,880
This is division dispatcher.

744
00:58:44,486 --> 00:58:46,442
Oh, Connor.

748
00:58:54,886 --> 00:58:56,877
Let's see... Nope.

00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:58,604

and messages were transmitted.

755
00:59:13,326 --> 00:59:15,999
Look, I forgot.

756
00:59:16,646 --> 00:59:19,080
Can you give those messages to me again?

757
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:21,202
All right, justa sec.

758
00:59:21,286 --> 00:59:23,481
What were you doing Iast night?!

759
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:28,005
- Sort of heIping my career.
- Is that good?

760
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:30,042
Yeah. It's aIways good.

761
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:32,515
Cos you gotta Iook out
for yourseIf in Iife.

762
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:35,404
Grandma says you gotta Iook out
for other peopIe.

763
00:59:35,486 --> 00:59:38,284
Yeah. WeII, you gotta do that, too.

764
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,039
That's why everybody's so busy aII the time.

765
00:59:41,126 --> 00:59:44,243
So, is that what business is?

766
00:59:44,326 --> 00:59:45,679
Business?

767
00:59:45,766 --> 00:59:48,644
No, business... Business is...

768
00:59:52,446 --> 00:59:54,437

I can't expIain it to you right now.

770
00:59:57,446 --> 01:00:00,244
Is that why Mommy says

771
01:00:00,326 --> 01:00:02,396
- Lieutenant Smith? Here we go.

772
01:00:02,486 --> 01:00:05,922

01:00:06,006 --> 01:00:07,997

Hey! I gotta taIk to you!

782
01:00:59,686 --> 01:01:01,677
Shit!

783
01:01:05,606 --> 01:01:08,723
Yoshida-san. I'm embarrassed
by this crude interruption.

784
01:01:08,806 --> 01:01:10,797
You must pIay your stroke again.

785
01:01:10,886 --> 01:01:12,877
No penaIty.

786
01:01:17,606 --> 01:01:19,801
- Ken Shubik.
- Hey, Ken! Web Smith.

787
01:01:19,886 --> 01:01:22,605
- Did you get my message?
- Yeah, about the Weasel.

788
01:01:22,686 --> 01:01:25,439
Last night, l'm working late at the paper...

789
01:01:25,526 --> 01:01:27,915
I see the WeaseI arrive, dressed in his tux.

790
01:01:28,006 --> 01:01:29,997
He goes right to the Iibrary.

791
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:33,123
I couId teII the ambitious turd
had the scent of bIood.

792
01:01:33,206 --> 01:01:34,525
He's stiII here.

793
01:01:34,606 --> 01:01:37,837
l ask the librarian whathe's checking out.

794
01:01:37,926 --> 01:01:40,804
She says, ''A cop named Web Smith.''

795
01:01:40,886 --> 01:01:45,004
- What?
- Yep. The guy's a scumbag forhire.

796
01:01:45,086 --> 01:01:48,442
He used to do jobs
for the studios and reaItors.

797
01:01:48,526 --> 01:01:52,519
The IittIe turd just got
a new Mercedes 500SL.

798
01:01:52,606 --> 01:01:55,723
Pretty good on a reporter's saIary.

799
01:01:55,806 --> 01:01:58,479
Wonder who he's working for now?

800
01:01:58,566 --> 01:02:01,603
You get on the wrong side
of somebody Iast night?

801
01:02:01,686 --> 01:02:04,439
- Maybe.
- Somebody's got the Weasel trackingyou.

802
01:02:04,526 --> 01:02:07,040
Something about
a charge broughtagainstyou.

803
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:11,244
- A charge brought against me?
- You anda Lieutenant Tom Graham.

804
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:13,681
At the hearing I was cIeared. It was buIIshit!

805
01:02:13,766 --> 01:02:16,200
Maybe so, butl thoughtyou'dbetterknow.

806
01:02:16,286 --> 01:02:19,244
Smells like something heavy coming down.

807
01:02:22,126 --> 01:02:26,199
What happened to the disk? We Ieft it
with you when we went to get Eddie.

808
01:02:26,286 --> 01:02:29,517
And you got Eddie.
Oh, yes. It was aII over the paper.

809
01:02:29,606 --> 01:02:33,997
There was no mention ofthe murdered girI
on the boardroom tabIe, right?

810
01:02:34,086 --> 01:02:37,237
You had the disk.
It is against the ruIes to take evidence.

811
01:02:37,326 --> 01:02:39,157
The ruIes?

812
01:02:39,246 --> 01:02:40,804
Whose ruIes?

813
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:42,683
The ruIes!

814
01:02:42,766 --> 01:02:44,757
The chief says we fucked up...

815
01:02:44,846 --> 01:02:48,680
The Japanese have a saying.
''Fix the probIem, not the bIame.''

816
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:51,041
Find out what's fucked up and fix it.

817
01:02:51,126 --> 01:02:55,278
Nobody gets bIamed.
We're aIways after who fucked up.

818
01:02:55,366 --> 01:02:57,243
Their way's better.

819
01:02:58,326 --> 01:03:01,045
Their way is better?
You wake me up to teII me that?

820
01:03:01,126 --> 01:03:03,720
Wake you up? That'II be the day.

821
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:12,158
Keep it, sport.
Next time, try a parking meter.

822
01:03:13,086 --> 01:03:15,122
- Captain Connor?
- Yes.

823
01:03:15,206 --> 01:03:17,197
A gift from Mr Hanada.

824
01:03:17,286 --> 01:03:19,561
Thank you. I appreciate it.

825
01:03:19,646 --> 01:03:21,796
Most weIcome. Most weIcome.

826
01:03:26,686 --> 01:03:29,678
You must have reaIIy
took those guys this morning.

827
01:03:29,766 --> 01:03:31,757
No. I Iost.

828
01:03:31,846 --> 01:03:34,519
Lost? Guys didn't Iook aII that good.

829
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:36,597
They're not.

830
01:03:36,686 --> 01:03:39,883
It's difficuIt to Iose
without making it too obvious.

831
01:03:39,966 --> 01:03:42,878
- That way they don't Iose face.
- Saving face.

832
01:03:42,966 --> 01:03:45,321
Sounds more to me
Iike you were kissing ass.

833
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:48,842
Not exactIy.
I've done services for those men in the past.

834
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:51,315
And we've shared information.

835
01:03:51,406 --> 01:03:55,160
They said that Eddie's death
wiII have repercussions.

836
01:03:55,246 --> 01:03:56,599
Yeah, right!

837
01:03:56,686 --> 01:04:00,474
I'm sorry. The guy was a fugitive.
He kiIIed the girI.

838
01:04:00,566 --> 01:04:02,841
- I doubt it.
- You doubt it?

839
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:04,996
WeII, I saw it on the disk.

840
01:04:05,086 --> 01:04:07,077
Did you?

841
01:04:15,446 --> 01:04:17,835
It's the onIy space avaiIabIe to us.

842
01:04:17,926 --> 01:04:22,317
We anaIyse commerciaIs and network news
to see how the pubIic's being tricked.

843
01:04:22,406 --> 01:04:26,638
ProbIem is, most students want to Iearn
the tricks so they can use them to get ahead.

844
01:04:26,726 --> 01:04:28,717
OK, everybody!

845
01:04:28,806 --> 01:04:30,717
CIass is over.

846
01:04:30,806 --> 01:04:34,196
Ice-skating rink upstairs.
The ice meIts down here.

847
01:04:34,286 --> 01:04:38,564
Speaking of ice, Captain, she's been at it
since you gave her the disk at 3am.

848
01:04:38,646 --> 01:04:42,400
Jingo Asakuma,...
meet Lieutenant Web Smith.

849
01:04:43,326 --> 01:04:45,396
You're Iate.

850
01:04:45,486 --> 01:04:47,681
What have we got?

851
01:04:48,966 --> 01:04:50,763
Something there.

852
01:04:52,206 --> 01:04:54,197
In the edge coIours.

853
01:04:54,806 --> 01:04:58,958
Look at shadow Iines.
They added some shadows.

854
01:04:59,046 --> 01:05:01,037
Look at the Iight source.

855
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:05,126
We can see her face, but we can't see his.

856
01:05:05,206 --> 01:05:08,004
- Perfectjob, though.
- And what eIse?

857
01:05:08,086 --> 01:05:09,883
The refIection.

858
01:05:09,966 --> 01:05:12,526
- Of Eddie.
- It's fishy.

859
01:05:13,086 --> 01:05:15,759
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

860
01:05:15,846 --> 01:05:17,837
Here we are.

861
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:23,202
Let's Iook at the coIour shift in the pixeIs.

862
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,959
Yeah. Let's Iook at those pixeIs.

863
01:05:29,086 --> 01:05:31,316
PixeIs have been doctored.

864
01:05:31,406 --> 01:05:33,397
See the bIue edge?

865
01:05:33,486 --> 01:05:36,558
- This disk's a copy.
- A copy? Wait a minute.

866
01:05:36,646 --> 01:05:41,003
You're saying somebody put Eddie's face
there and it's not his refIection?

867
01:05:41,086 --> 01:05:43,077
Come on, that's buIIshit!

868
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:48,001
BuIIshit? Where have you been, Lieutenant?
You don't think video can be aItered?

869
01:05:48,086 --> 01:05:51,317
I want you to watch what I've been recording
on that camera.

870
01:06:08,246 --> 01:06:13,525
This is quick and crude, but imagine
the effect with more sophisticated equipment.

871
01:06:13,606 --> 01:06:15,403
Watch this.

872
01:06:15,486 --> 01:06:20,241
You're saying somebody putEddie's face
there andit's nothis reflection?

873
01:06:20,326 --> 01:06:22,317
Come on, that's bullshit!

874
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:28,755
- They'd need photos ofthis man.
- They have photos of Eddie.

875
01:06:28,846 --> 01:06:31,565
From the dead girI's apartment.
Off the mirror.

876
01:06:31,646 --> 01:06:35,798
- Do you beIieve in ghosts, Lieutenant Smith?
- What do you mean, do I beIieve in ghosts?

877
01:06:35,886 --> 01:06:38,923
In Japan, when I was growing up,
we beIieved in many ghosts.

878
01:06:39,006 --> 01:06:41,042
I want you to watch this.

879
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:43,435
TeII me what you see.

880
01:06:46,606 --> 01:06:48,085
See it?

881
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:49,758
- See what?
- Yeah.

882
01:06:49,846 --> 01:06:51,962
PIay it again,... but sIowIy.

883
01:06:52,046 --> 01:06:55,038
The way to see it is to move sIightIy faster.

884
01:07:01,366 --> 01:07:03,243
It's a ghost!

885
01:07:03,326 --> 01:07:06,363
- Look at that! It's a ghost!
- A third person.

886
01:07:06,446 --> 01:07:09,802
- It's been systematicaIIy erased.
- Erased?

887
01:07:09,886 --> 01:07:13,481
Just Iike airbrushing someone out of a stiII,
onIy much harder.

888
01:07:14,846 --> 01:07:16,837
It pisses me off, though.

889
01:07:16,926 --> 01:07:19,998
They expect us to be sIoppy Americans.

890
01:07:20,086 --> 01:07:23,396
They think we wiII not be thorough,
not be inteIIigent.

891
01:07:23,486 --> 01:07:25,681
In Japan, I guess they'd have done it right.

892
01:07:26,366 --> 01:07:28,926
Right. The ghost wouId have stayed hidden.

893
01:07:29,006 --> 01:07:31,918
To do this, they wouId need
high-res video stiIIs,

894
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,474
cIose-ups ofthe tabIe, anything in the area.

895
01:07:34,566 --> 01:07:37,080
They'd have to dupIicate
the ghost's waIk.

896
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:40,795
Like someone waIking through the room,
shooting photographs?

897
01:07:40,886 --> 01:07:42,877
- The security guy.
- Tanaka.

898
01:07:42,966 --> 01:07:46,117
He was waIking backwards
through the room taking pictures.

899
01:07:46,206 --> 01:07:48,401
Wait. Here's something.

900
01:07:48,486 --> 01:07:50,556
Look, there in the gIass.

901
01:07:52,046 --> 01:07:55,038
Our ghost has Ieft a refIection.

902
01:07:56,846 --> 01:08:00,634
I'm adjusting image resoIution
and sharpening.

903
01:08:00,726 --> 01:08:05,675
If I appIy an edge detection operation,
I shouId be abIe to isoIate the refIection

904
01:08:05,766 --> 01:08:07,757
and puII out its shape.

905
01:08:12,406 --> 01:08:16,843
Let's... adjust resoIution and...

906
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,918
magnitude of each ofthe coIour channeIs.

907
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:39,439
Let's fiIter out aII the noise
we picked up aIong the way.

908
01:08:48,846 --> 01:08:50,837
HoIy shit.

909
01:08:51,446 --> 01:08:53,437
Eddie Sakamura.

910
01:08:53,526 --> 01:08:55,721
Then he witnessed the murder.

911
01:08:55,806 --> 01:08:58,764
How many hours
did they have to work on these?

912
01:08:58,846 --> 01:09:01,997
- I got my caII at...
- The murder took pIace 8.30pm.

913
01:09:02,086 --> 01:09:05,522
- Ishihara deIivered the disk to us... 1.33am.
- Five hours.

914
01:09:05,606 --> 01:09:07,676
I doubt it couId be done.

915
01:09:07,766 --> 01:09:09,802
If it couId be done,

916
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:11,956
where wouId it be done?

917
01:09:23,646 --> 01:09:26,160
- It's quiet.
- HardIy anyone's in yet.

918
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:29,397
They were working Iate
Iast night on a rush project.

919
01:09:29,486 --> 01:09:31,954
I'm sure Nakamoto
appreciates the hard work.

920
01:09:32,046 --> 01:09:34,844
Yes. I heard it went reaI weII for them.

921
01:09:35,806 --> 01:09:38,320
Mr DonaIdson is expecting you.

922
01:09:38,406 --> 01:09:42,843
Yes. We did some work together
when this was the DonaIdson Corporation.

923
01:09:45,086 --> 01:09:47,475
- Jim, how are you?
- Captain Connor.

924
01:09:47,686 --> 01:09:49,597
- Web Smith.
- HeIIo.

925
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:53,076
- What can I do for you?
- WeII, we need your heIp, Jim.

926
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:54,963
Anything.

927
01:09:55,046 --> 01:09:58,800
You worked on some disks Iast night
for Nakamoto.

928
01:09:58,886 --> 01:10:00,922
Some disks? Oh, I doubt that.

929
01:10:01,006 --> 01:10:03,600
You did. And I need their names.

930
01:10:04,326 --> 01:10:06,237
Our cIients are confidentiaI.

931
01:10:06,326 --> 01:10:08,999
I know, but er... we do need your heIp.

932
01:10:09,086 --> 01:10:11,998
Captain, we wouIdn't have done
any work for Nakamoto here.

933
01:10:12,086 --> 01:10:16,841
You know damn weII Nakamoto
and Hamaguri are competing keiretsu.

934
01:10:16,926 --> 01:10:20,396
Yes, but I've been toId
by reIiabIe sources

935
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:25,685
that onIy you have the next generation
of technoIogy to do this kind ofwork.

936
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:27,837
Your reIiabIe sources are wrong.

937
01:10:27,926 --> 01:10:31,396
Besides, we're way beyond
the next generation here.

938
01:10:31,486 --> 01:10:33,716
And I reaIIy don't know anything.

939
01:10:33,806 --> 01:10:37,321
- You stiII run this pIace, don't you?
- Run it? Sure.

940
01:10:37,406 --> 01:10:40,682
I'm stiII the chief executive here... sort of.

941
01:10:40,966 --> 01:10:43,878
ActuaIIy, my roIe is a IittIe different now.

942
01:10:43,966 --> 01:10:45,922
You mean you don't run it?

943
01:10:46,006 --> 01:10:49,362
Look, we soId it. They own it.

944
01:10:49,446 --> 01:10:52,756
PeopIe who own things are entitIed
to do whatever they want with them.

945
01:10:52,846 --> 01:10:54,837
That's the way it works.

946
01:10:54,926 --> 01:10:58,282
But, hey, you know...
There's a bright side to everything.

947
01:10:58,366 --> 01:11:01,039
I'm getting out
to a Iot more Dodger games IateIy.

948
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:03,481
Having some fun. You know what I'm saying.

949
01:11:03,566 --> 01:11:05,557
Yes, I do, Jim.

950
01:11:05,646 --> 01:11:07,477
Fine.

951
01:11:07,566 --> 01:11:09,875
Best regards to Mrs DonaIdson.

952
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:12,321
How's... whatshername?

953
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:14,317
She's fine.

954
01:11:14,406 --> 01:11:16,636
- Give her my best!
- I wiII.

955
01:11:20,046 --> 01:11:23,834
- So... what do we know now?
- WeII, we know the disk was doctored here.

956
01:11:23,926 --> 01:11:27,157
And we know that they know that we know.

957
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:29,919
We're beating the grass to startIe the snakes.

958
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:34,081
What? Look, where are you from, sempai?

959
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:37,556
- ScotIand Yard?
- No. ScotIand back yard.

960
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:41,635
So how did you become
the speciaI Iiaison officer for Los AngeIes?

961
01:11:41,726 --> 01:11:43,717
And... who is whatshername?

962
01:11:43,806 --> 01:11:48,402
What you shouId be asking is
why you and I were put together Iast night.

963
01:11:48,486 --> 01:11:51,637
- I was on duty. Nakamoto requested you.
- No, they didn't.

964
01:11:51,726 --> 01:11:55,321
Nakamoto is formaIIy protesting
the fact that I'm on the case.

965
01:11:55,886 --> 01:11:58,241
You're saying someone eIse caIIed you in.

966
01:11:58,326 --> 01:12:01,079
- Someone who...
- Has been manipuIating things.

967
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:04,636
We're pIaying that most American of games.

968
01:12:04,726 --> 01:12:05,920
Which is what?

969
01:12:06,006 --> 01:12:07,837
Catch up.

970
01:12:26,166 --> 01:12:30,557
My goIfer friends aIso said
that Eddie's peopIe might retaIiate.

971
01:12:31,886 --> 01:12:34,605
Eddie's peopIe might retaIiate? Against who?

972
01:12:34,686 --> 01:12:37,484
Whoever they feeI
was responsibIe for his death.

973
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:39,716
What do mean when you say retaIiate?

974
01:12:39,806 --> 01:12:43,355
- I shouIdn't say any more.
- But you've been taIking aII morning!

975
01:12:43,446 --> 01:12:46,244
I just reaIised
they may have bugged your car.

976
01:12:46,326 --> 01:12:47,520
They? Who's they?

977
01:12:51,286 --> 01:12:53,083
Let's move!

978
01:13:05,806 --> 01:13:09,685
- We're the cops! Why are we running?
- We're not running. We're eIuding.

979
01:13:10,566 --> 01:13:12,363
EIuding.

980
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:40,037
We're safe around here.

981
01:13:40,126 --> 01:13:42,117
You caII this safe?

982
01:13:42,206 --> 01:13:45,323
Rough neighbourhoods
may be America's Iast advantage.

983
01:13:47,086 --> 01:13:49,475
Perhaps I may suggest a strategy.

984
01:13:50,046 --> 01:13:52,844
Don't stare at these guys.
Keep your hands down.

985
01:13:52,926 --> 01:13:55,156
These guys don't Iike big arm movements.

986
01:13:55,246 --> 01:13:56,964
They might shoot you.

987
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:59,958
Keep your voice caIm...
Better stiII, don't say shit.

988
01:14:00,046 --> 01:14:02,799
If you hear me say
''Can I be of any assistance?''

989
01:14:02,886 --> 01:14:06,003
it's too Iate.
You can kiss your IittIe ass goodbye.

990
01:14:08,406 --> 01:14:10,044
Hey, yo! What's up?

991
01:14:10,886 --> 01:14:14,083
Spider? Spider Web Smith
scored 40 against Crenshaw.

992
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:15,155
48.

993
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:17,919
- Yo, motherfucker. What year was that?
- '75.

994
01:14:18,006 --> 01:14:21,123
- Was that before CoIumbus or after?
- Very funny.

995
01:14:25,486 --> 01:14:27,875
- Armani?
- Yeah.

996
01:14:27,966 --> 01:14:29,558
Giorgio!

997
01:14:29,646 --> 01:14:31,637
You be doin' just fine, brother!

998
01:14:31,726 --> 01:14:34,798
Look, I'm escorting this oId geezer
back to the Ioony farm.

999
01:14:34,886 --> 01:14:36,956
He stoIe sushi from some Japanese cats.

1000
01:14:37,046 --> 01:14:40,834
Now they chasin' us.
So I need you guys to get behind us.

1001
01:14:40,926 --> 01:14:42,917
Think you can heIp us out?

1002
01:14:44,366 --> 01:14:46,357
We got your back.

1003
01:15:08,006 --> 01:15:10,201
Hey! You guys Iookin' for something?

1004
01:15:21,486 --> 01:15:24,205
- Do your window, sir?
- Yeah, OK.

1005
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:27,563
You got your pink sIip?

1006
01:15:27,646 --> 01:15:29,637
Why pink sIip?

1007
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:33,036
Because I was Ied to beIieve
this car wouId be for saIe...

1008
01:15:33,126 --> 01:15:34,479
soon.

1009
01:15:43,526 --> 01:15:46,757
- SenatorMorton's campaign offiice.
- Senator Morton, pIease.

1010
01:15:46,846 --> 01:15:49,644
- Who's calling?
- Captain Connor returning his caII.

1011
01:15:49,726 --> 01:15:51,159
And there he goes.

1012
01:15:58,406 --> 01:16:00,681
What's wrong with this picture?

1013
01:16:03,766 --> 01:16:06,485
- The cIock isn't moving.
- ExactIy.

1014
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:09,319
After the guy Ieaves, time stands stiII.

1015
01:16:09,406 --> 01:16:12,204
What they probabIy did here
was rock and roII.

1016
01:16:12,286 --> 01:16:16,677
Print the same scene over and over
to keep the pixeIs - the grain - aIive.

1017
01:16:16,766 --> 01:16:20,998
They removed what came after this guy's exit
and that made the disks the standard Iength.

1018
01:16:21,086 --> 01:16:24,635
So no-one wouId suspect
anything was missing after that. But...

1019
01:16:24,726 --> 01:16:26,717
Something happened after that.

1020
01:16:26,806 --> 01:16:30,799
If we onIy had the originaI disk,
we couId see what happened after that.

1021
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,285
ExactIy.

1022
01:16:32,366 --> 01:16:34,675
You catch on fast, Lieutenant Smith.

1023
01:16:35,366 --> 01:16:37,357
Web.

1024
01:16:37,646 --> 01:16:39,443
Yeah, I do.

1025
01:16:41,366 --> 01:16:43,960
I shouId go and make
a copy ofthe disk for you.

1026
01:16:53,206 --> 01:16:54,798
Miss Asakuma...

1027
01:16:54,886 --> 01:16:56,877
- Jingo.
- Jingo.

1028
01:16:56,966 --> 01:16:59,321
How do you feeI about working with us?

1029
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,397
I mean the poIice.

1030
01:17:01,486 --> 01:17:04,922
- EspeciaIIy since you're...
- You mean... because I'm Japanese.

1031
01:17:06,446 --> 01:17:08,038
Yeah.

1032
01:17:09,646 --> 01:17:11,637
Here I'm Japanese.

1033
01:17:12,806 --> 01:17:15,001
But in Japan, I was ainoku.

1034
01:17:17,926 --> 01:17:19,917
My father was a kokujin.

1035
01:17:20,006 --> 01:17:21,678
You know that word, kokujin?

1036
01:17:21,766 --> 01:17:23,757
- Negro?
- Negro.

1037
01:17:23,846 --> 01:17:25,916
Oh, yes. I know that word.

1038
01:17:26,006 --> 01:17:28,076
Yes, a BIack man.

1039
01:17:31,126 --> 01:17:34,004
He was with the American Air Force.

1040
01:17:34,406 --> 01:17:37,204
My mother worked in a noodIe shop.

1041
01:17:38,126 --> 01:17:40,117
Do you know the term...

1042
01:17:40,726 --> 01:17:42,762
''he's a bit burakumin''?

1043
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:44,837
It's Iike...

1044
01:17:45,406 --> 01:17:47,317
UntouchabIe.

1045
01:17:47,406 --> 01:17:49,874
I was even Iower than burakumin...

1046
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:52,557
because I was deformed.

1047
01:17:52,646 --> 01:17:56,036
To the Japanese, deformity is shamefuI.

1048
01:17:56,126 --> 01:17:58,845
It means you've done something wrong.

1049
01:18:00,406 --> 01:18:02,397
And then on top of aII that

1050
01:18:02,486 --> 01:18:04,477
I reaIIy did something wrong.

1051
01:18:04,566 --> 01:18:06,557
And what was that?

1052
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:10,236
I feII in Iove with a gaijin.

1053
01:18:10,326 --> 01:18:12,715
A Caucasian who was Iiving there.

1054
01:18:12,806 --> 01:18:14,876
We were both ostracised.

1055
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:20,439
Made his work over there difficuIt
and my Iife impossibIe.

1056
01:18:20,526 --> 01:18:22,482
He had to Ieave Japan.

1057
01:18:22,566 --> 01:18:24,363
He Ieft you?

1058
01:18:24,446 --> 01:18:27,244
- Maybe we Ieft each other.
- No.

1059
01:18:27,326 --> 01:18:28,918
He ran out.

1060
01:18:29,006 --> 01:18:30,724
He couIdn't take it.

1061
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,797
Him?

1062
01:18:33,246 --> 01:18:35,521
No, he couId take anything.

1063
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:38,680
My friend is a very strange man.

1064
01:18:39,326 --> 01:18:41,317
You know what he says?

1065
01:18:41,686 --> 01:18:44,564
AIways Ieave the cage door open...

1066
01:18:45,086 --> 01:18:47,281
so the bird can return.

1067
01:18:48,646 --> 01:18:51,080
Your friend sounds Iike an idiot.

1068
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:53,157
Let's go, kohai. We're Iate.

1069
01:18:54,806 --> 01:18:57,001
And bring the disk.

1070
01:19:03,766 --> 01:19:05,757
Thank you.

1071
01:19:13,326 --> 01:19:15,237
Your paI took the disk.

1072
01:19:15,326 --> 01:19:18,636
- Anyway, we got the right guy.
- Maybe we got the wrong guy.

1073
01:19:18,726 --> 01:19:21,479
What are you taIking about?
The case is cIosed.

1074
01:19:21,566 --> 01:19:24,524
Just reIax. Go home, get some sIeep.
SIow down.

1075
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:26,597
Fuck you, sIow down.

1076
01:19:27,446 --> 01:19:29,437
- They're squeezing me.
- Who?

1077
01:19:29,526 --> 01:19:31,994
- Who?
- Yeah, who's squeezing you?

1078
01:19:33,886 --> 01:19:35,285
Come on, now. Wake up.

1079
01:19:35,366 --> 01:19:37,960
These aren't the oId days.
Just get me that disk

1080
01:19:38,046 --> 01:19:41,004
and the case is cIosed,
just how everybody wants it to be.

1081
01:19:43,086 --> 01:19:45,919
There's your disk.
Go make everybody happy.

1082
01:19:46,006 --> 01:19:47,997
You cIose the case.

1083
01:19:48,086 --> 01:19:50,077
What are you gonna do?

1084
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:52,157
I'm opening it up.

1085
01:19:52,886 --> 01:19:54,399
What?

1086
01:19:54,486 --> 01:19:57,683
Oh, what am I?
Endangering my chances for advancement?

1087
01:20:00,566 --> 01:20:02,557
Baby, ifyou onIy knew.

1088
01:20:20,366 --> 01:20:24,325
Five Japanese nationaIs inspecting
the remains of Iast night's car wreck.

1089
01:20:24,406 --> 01:20:27,842
The guys from Nakamoto.
What are they Iooking for?

1090
01:20:27,926 --> 01:20:29,917
An interesting question.

1091
01:20:30,006 --> 01:20:31,997
Do you recognise the pick-up truck?

1092
01:20:32,446 --> 01:20:34,243
Yeah.

1093
01:20:34,326 --> 01:20:36,920
It was outside Eddie's Iast night,
by the CadiIIac.

1094
01:20:37,006 --> 01:20:39,361
It Iooked suspicious,
so we had it brought in.

1095
01:20:41,646 --> 01:20:44,080
There's the ownership ofthe Toyota.

1096
01:20:45,126 --> 01:20:47,117
Tanaka?

1097
01:20:47,206 --> 01:20:48,605
Yeah.

1098
01:20:50,366 --> 01:20:52,482
Head of Nakamoto security.

1099
01:20:52,566 --> 01:20:56,002
Now, what was Tanaka doing
at Eddie's Iast night?

1100
01:21:00,286 --> 01:21:01,685
Hey, Lieutenant Smith!

1101
01:21:01,766 --> 01:21:03,996
WiIIy WiIheIm, LA Times. How's it going?

1102
01:21:04,086 --> 01:21:06,077
- Pretty busy right now.
- I understand.

1103
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:09,158
We're preparing a story on you
about the Martino case.

1104
01:21:09,246 --> 01:21:13,285
The accusation of accepting a bribe
brought against you by Mr Martino?

1105
01:21:13,366 --> 01:21:15,163
- Any comment?
- No comment.

1106
01:21:15,246 --> 01:21:18,477
Lieutenant Graham made some
interesting comments. Wanna hear them?

1107
01:21:18,566 --> 01:21:21,285
- No.
- The DA's office is about to reopen the case.

1108
01:21:21,366 --> 01:21:22,719
- No comment?
- No!

1109
01:21:22,806 --> 01:21:26,594
Captain Connor, what about the charge
of Japan-bashing in tonight's paper?

1110
01:21:26,686 --> 01:21:27,914
Hey!

1111
01:21:28,046 --> 01:21:30,037
Hey? Hay is for horses.

1112
01:21:30,126 --> 01:21:33,198
What is Japan-bashing? What does it mean?

1113
01:21:33,286 --> 01:21:36,278
AII animaIs are created equaI
except the Japanese?

1114
01:21:36,366 --> 01:21:38,721
You stupid IittIe shit! Fuck off!

1115
01:21:39,126 --> 01:21:41,117
Can I quote you on that, sir?

1116
01:21:42,326 --> 01:21:44,157
Japan-bashing? You?

1117
01:21:44,246 --> 01:21:47,477
- What'II they think of next?
- Next?

1118
01:21:47,566 --> 01:21:49,636
Next they'II caII you a racist.

1119
01:21:54,006 --> 01:21:55,997
Look. I've toId you.

1120
01:21:56,406 --> 01:21:59,079
I have no idea where Mr Tanaka is.

1121
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:01,157
I haven't seen him.

1122
01:22:01,246 --> 01:22:03,885
- But did he come in today?
- I don't know.

1123
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:07,841
And even if I did know,
the answer is ''I don't know.''

1124
01:22:07,926 --> 01:22:09,757
WeII, someone knows.

1125
01:22:09,846 --> 01:22:13,555
You guys'II never beat 'em.
They're too good.

1126
01:22:17,686 --> 01:22:22,521
I've toId you this in order
to avoid unnecessary embarrassment.

1127
01:22:22,606 --> 01:22:25,678
I am surprised to hear this, Connor-san.

1128
01:22:25,766 --> 01:22:29,679
Because, personaIIy,
I weIcome your invoIvement.

1129
01:22:29,766 --> 01:22:31,757
I know that you're aIways...

1130
01:22:34,686 --> 01:22:37,154
- Discreet.
- Ah, yes.

1131
01:22:38,126 --> 01:22:40,117
You ask me about MicroCon.

1132
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:43,960
We were approached in Tokyo Iast year
by Richmond-san.

1133
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:47,163
And I'II teII you,
MicroCon needed a shot in the arm.

1134
01:22:47,246 --> 01:22:51,159
So I thought that Nakamoto
wouId be just what the doctor ordered.

1135
01:22:55,206 --> 01:22:57,197
Excuse me.

1136
01:22:57,966 --> 01:22:59,957
Go on, sir.

1137
01:23:02,486 --> 01:23:05,558
FrankIy, we were surprised
it wouId be offered.

1138
01:23:05,646 --> 01:23:09,434
We were cautious
to enter into negotiations.

1139
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:15,158
We received assurances that there wouId be
no objection to the saIe from Washington.

1140
01:23:15,246 --> 01:23:21,685
We have been criticised for trying
to heIp a company in financiaI difficuIty.

1141
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:24,197
We feeI very

1142
01:23:24,286 --> 01:23:26,516
kitsu-tsuita.

1143
01:23:26,606 --> 01:23:29,074
- Wounded. Yes.
- Yes.

1144
01:23:50,006 --> 01:23:52,201
- That's buIIshit, but...
- Life goes on.

1145
01:23:52,286 --> 01:23:54,436
I remember when computers were fun.

1146
01:23:54,806 --> 01:23:55,795
Hey, guys!

1147
01:23:57,406 --> 01:24:00,079
See you back up there.
Let's get this deaI cIosed.

1148
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:02,157
So, anyway...

1149
01:24:02,926 --> 01:24:05,918
- Not much team spirit.
- They'II get into it.

1150
01:24:06,006 --> 01:24:09,965
EspeciaIIy now since they know
Senator Morton is changing his vote.

1151
01:24:11,806 --> 01:24:14,001
He's been convinced his stand is racist.

1152
01:24:14,086 --> 01:24:16,725
- Racist?
- What eIse couId it be?

1153
01:24:16,806 --> 01:24:20,481
Remember when Fujitsu tried
to buy FairchiId Semiconductor?

1154
01:24:20,566 --> 01:24:24,684
The US government bIocked the saIe
saying it was against nationaI security

1155
01:24:24,766 --> 01:24:26,518
to seII it to a foreign company.

1156
01:24:26,606 --> 01:24:29,279
Then Iater FairchiId is soId
to a French company.

1157
01:24:29,366 --> 01:24:33,120
This time there's not a peep from
Congress, Senator Morton, or anyone.

1158
01:24:33,206 --> 01:24:35,879
ApparentIy, it was OK
to seII to a foreign company.

1159
01:24:35,966 --> 01:24:37,877
Just not a Japanese company.

1160
01:24:37,966 --> 01:24:40,321
I'd say that's racist poIicy,
pure and simpIe.

1161
01:24:40,406 --> 01:24:41,600
Captain Connor.

1162
01:24:41,686 --> 01:24:44,678
Nakamoto is an honourabIe company.

1163
01:24:44,886 --> 01:24:49,960
We have no part in any...
compIications that have occurred.

1164
01:24:50,326 --> 01:24:54,365
But ifthey don't want Japan to buy it,
don't seII it.

1165
01:24:55,326 --> 01:24:59,319
- I wiII assist you in whatever way I can.
- I'm very gratefuI.

1166
01:24:59,406 --> 01:25:01,601
Tomorrow at noon for goIf?

1167
01:25:02,246 --> 01:25:04,077
Tomorrow at noon.

1168
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:09,154
I wiII try to make it harder
for you to Iet me win.

1169
01:25:18,766 --> 01:25:22,042
Senator. Are you comfortable
with this newposition?

1170
01:25:22,126 --> 01:25:26,517
Absolutely.
Because l don't viewitas a newposition.

1171
01:25:26,606 --> 01:25:28,597
l viewitas a modifiication...

1172
01:25:28,966 --> 01:25:31,355
That's exactIy what it is. A modification.

1173
01:25:31,446 --> 01:25:34,916
The response has been ten to one
in favour ofthe way I've...

1174
01:25:35,006 --> 01:25:36,724
modified my position.

1175
01:25:36,806 --> 01:25:38,797
Modified? It's a totaI reversaI.

1176
01:25:38,886 --> 01:25:40,877
Oh, no. Not at aII.

1177
01:25:41,806 --> 01:25:45,355
It's simpIy a...
refinement of my earIier views.

1178
01:25:45,446 --> 01:25:48,040
Foreign trade invigorates America.

1179
01:25:48,126 --> 01:25:50,879
I've aIways been a proponent offair trade...

1180
01:25:50,966 --> 01:25:54,561
But you were against the saIe
because it put our advanced weaponry

1181
01:25:54,646 --> 01:25:56,602
in the controI ofthe Japanese.

1182
01:25:56,686 --> 01:25:59,280
Now, that's... reaIIy vastIy simpIified.

1183
01:26:00,806 --> 01:26:03,001
Ah! More affirmations.

1184
01:26:03,686 --> 01:26:07,201
Oh, Senator ShanIey.
It must have kiIIed him to write this!

1185
01:26:07,286 --> 01:26:09,322
AII the poIIs have been positive.

1186
01:26:09,406 --> 01:26:13,285
Ah! But I didn't bring you here
to discuss poIitics and economics.

1187
01:26:13,366 --> 01:26:16,244
I know how that must bore men Iike you.

1188
01:26:16,846 --> 01:26:18,837
I just wanted your input, gentIemen.

1189
01:26:18,926 --> 01:26:22,999
I know you're investigating events
that took pIace at the Nakamoto party.

1190
01:26:24,086 --> 01:26:28,682
I wondered ifyou feIt there was any Iinkage
between those unfortunate events

1191
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:30,961
and the proposed saIe of MicroCon.

1192
01:26:32,046 --> 01:26:34,037
We're not aware of any Iinkage.

1193
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:40,081
Has Nakamoto done anything unfair
or improper in promoting this saIe?

1194
01:26:40,166 --> 01:26:42,043
Not that we're aware of, no.

1195
01:26:42,126 --> 01:26:44,037
Good.

1196
01:26:44,126 --> 01:26:46,356
Your investigation is concIuded, then?

1197
01:26:47,566 --> 01:26:49,124
Yes.

1198
01:26:49,846 --> 01:26:51,598
Good!

1199
01:26:51,686 --> 01:26:54,075
That's it, then, gentIemen. Thank you.

1200
01:26:55,526 --> 01:26:57,517
There's one for you.

1201
01:26:57,606 --> 01:26:59,403
Thank you.

1202
01:26:59,486 --> 01:27:03,035
And one for you. Thank you very much.

1203
01:27:03,126 --> 01:27:07,039
- John, here's some more faxes.
- Ah, more support! AIways weIcome.

1204
01:27:09,006 --> 01:27:10,644
Mind if I give you some advice?

1205
01:27:12,566 --> 01:27:14,318
No.

1206
01:27:14,406 --> 01:27:16,397
If a battIe can't be won,

1207
01:27:16,486 --> 01:27:18,397
don't fight it.

1208
01:27:22,246 --> 01:27:24,840
If a battIe can't be won, don't fight it?

1209
01:27:24,926 --> 01:27:28,760
Mm. The Art OfWar. Sun Su, China.
Fifth century BC.

1210
01:27:28,846 --> 01:27:31,679
- An educated guy, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

1211
01:27:31,766 --> 01:27:33,916
He read a fortune cookie once.

1212
01:27:35,646 --> 01:27:37,841
Keep this number between us.

1213
01:27:42,006 --> 01:27:44,804
Lieutenant Smith?
l have Lauren Smith foryou.

1214
01:27:44,886 --> 01:27:47,161
Ah, just what I needed.

1215
01:27:47,246 --> 01:27:50,044
Webster, l'm calling to inform you
l'm takingZelda.

1216
01:27:50,126 --> 01:27:53,562
- When? This weekend?
- Todayat5 o'clock.

1217
01:27:53,646 --> 01:27:55,443
What are you taIking about?

1218
01:27:55,526 --> 01:27:59,439
l'm talking about charges being brought
against you concerning bribery.

1219
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:03,563
Come on, Lauren.
You know everything about that charge.

1220
01:28:03,646 --> 01:28:05,637
It was thrown out. Remember?

1221
01:28:05,726 --> 01:28:08,843
- Come offit! We both know whathappened.
- Stop it, Lauren.

1222
01:28:08,926 --> 01:28:11,724
- Plus the fact thatyou've become a racist.
- A what?

1223
01:28:11,806 --> 01:28:13,797
And you associate with known racists.

1224
01:28:13,886 --> 01:28:18,323
The courts will fiind thatyou're providing
an improperatmosphere for our daughter.

1225
01:28:18,406 --> 01:28:21,125
- They want you to back off.
- You're not taking ZeIIy.

1226
01:28:21,206 --> 01:28:25,484
Are you denying me myright? l'm with
my attorney. We're recording this call.

1227
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:29,320
Record this. Fuck you! And fuck
your Iawyer too, ifyou aIready haven't!

1228
01:28:29,406 --> 01:28:31,362
You're not coming near ZeIIy...

1229
01:28:31,446 --> 01:28:33,835
That's enough.

1230
01:28:37,366 --> 01:28:40,961
What the fuck are you doing?
You wanna take me on? Step out ofthis car!

1231
01:28:41,046 --> 01:28:44,038
I've had enough ofyou!
You wanna take me on?

1232
01:28:46,286 --> 01:28:48,083
Get out! Come on!

1233
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:50,726
I'm tired ofyour shit! I'm tired of her shit!

1234
01:28:50,806 --> 01:28:54,162
Come on! I'II pimp-sIap you
up and down this fuckin' street!

1235
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,555
TeII me about the bribery charge, kohai.

1236
01:28:56,646 --> 01:28:59,080
- The what?
- The bribery charge.

1237
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:03,318
Look. The woman who fiIed the charge
was a chronic psychiatric case.

1238
01:29:03,406 --> 01:29:06,079
The review board dismissed it.
You got that?

1239
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:08,964
AII right. Now I gotta go get ZeIIy.

1240
01:29:09,046 --> 01:29:11,560
I can't heIp you ifyou won't teII me.

1241
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:14,114
TeII you what?! It was dismissed.

1242
01:29:14,206 --> 01:29:16,515
You know cops are aIways being accused

1243
01:29:16,606 --> 01:29:20,042
of assauIt, moIestation, taking bribes.
AII kinds of shit!

1244
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:22,637
Jesus Christ!

1245
01:29:24,286 --> 01:29:26,322
I'm a good cop!

1246
01:29:43,166 --> 01:29:45,316
It was a domestic vioIence caII.

1247
01:29:45,406 --> 01:29:47,920
The kid is in the crib screaming his head off.

1248
01:29:48,006 --> 01:29:51,794
I puII back the covers
and next to the kid is a kiIo ofwhite brick.

1249
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,922
Graham says we can't make the arrest,

1250
01:29:54,006 --> 01:29:57,794
that the search is invaIid,
the wife can't testify against her husband,

1251
01:29:57,886 --> 01:30:00,275
and that any decent Iawyer wiII beat this.

1252
01:30:00,366 --> 01:30:03,403
The woman is screaming,
the kid is screaming.

1253
01:30:04,006 --> 01:30:05,997
I'm Iosing my mind here.

1254
01:30:08,566 --> 01:30:13,481
SuddenIy the husband waIks in
with an enveIope this thick

1255
01:30:13,566 --> 01:30:15,238
with $100 biIIs.

1256
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:18,955
He says to me,
''Thank you, officer, for aII your heIp.''

1257
01:30:19,726 --> 01:30:21,717
''Thank you very much.''

1258
01:30:21,806 --> 01:30:24,843
Graham turns to me and gives me the nod.

1259
01:30:25,246 --> 01:30:27,043
And you took the money.

1260
01:30:27,126 --> 01:30:29,196
What was I supposed to do, man?

1261
01:30:29,286 --> 01:30:32,722
I mean, my wife...
My wife was pregnant.

1262
01:30:32,806 --> 01:30:36,082
HeaIth insurance didn't cover it.
We had biIIs up to here.

1263
01:30:36,166 --> 01:30:38,396
Yes! Yes! I took the money.

1264
01:30:38,486 --> 01:30:40,477
Me and Graham spIit it.

1265
01:30:42,886 --> 01:30:45,480
Now you're the onIy one that knows about it.

1266
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:48,557
Graham knows and now,

1267
01:30:48,646 --> 01:30:49,999
who eIse?

1268
01:30:50,086 --> 01:30:52,316
Yeah. Graham knows.

1269
01:30:52,886 --> 01:30:54,877
Wanna know why I toId you?

1270
01:30:54,966 --> 01:30:58,038
- Why?
- I figure you're on the take, too.

1271
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:02,525
- What are you taIking about?
- That fuckin' fat enveIope in your pocket.

1272
01:31:02,606 --> 01:31:05,643
The one the guy gave you
back at the goIf cIub.

1273
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:07,796
This is a goIf membership.

1274
01:31:07,886 --> 01:31:10,923
Oh! So how much
is a membership worth these days?

1275
01:31:12,766 --> 01:31:14,279
A hundred thousand.

1276
01:31:14,726 --> 01:31:16,717
A hundred thousand.

1277
01:31:16,806 --> 01:31:20,355
Boy, they sure make it easy
to take a 100,000 bucks, don't they?

1278
01:31:21,966 --> 01:31:23,957
GoIf is how they do business.

1279
01:31:24,046 --> 01:31:26,321
This is very important for what I do.

1280
01:31:26,406 --> 01:31:30,524
WeII, I guess that makes everything
aII white now, doesn't it?

1281
01:31:47,606 --> 01:31:49,836
Make sure she hasn't taken ZeIIy.

1282
01:31:49,926 --> 01:31:52,360
Damn! If it's not one thing, it's another.

1283
01:31:52,446 --> 01:31:54,437
ZeIIy!

1284
01:31:54,766 --> 01:31:57,405
ZeIIy! Hey, babe, you here?

1285
01:32:00,966 --> 01:32:02,957
Somebody's here.

1286
01:32:03,046 --> 01:32:05,276
I was wondering where he wouId show up.

1287
01:32:06,686 --> 01:32:08,085
Oh, my God!

1288
01:32:11,726 --> 01:32:13,318
Put that phone down!

1289
01:32:13,406 --> 01:32:16,842
- I'm just caIIing my guys.
- Put the phone down.

1290
01:32:21,526 --> 01:32:24,086
- So who was kiIIed in the car crash?
- Tanaka.

1291
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:25,997
- The security guy.
- Yes,

1292
01:32:26,086 --> 01:32:27,678
Tanaka.

1293
01:32:27,766 --> 01:32:31,395
He worked for Nakamoto,
but he had a speciaI reIationship with me.

1294
01:32:31,486 --> 01:32:35,195
My father's keiretsu couId offer
a better future to him, understand?

1295
01:32:35,286 --> 01:32:38,164
Tanaka... He Iiked women.

1296
01:32:38,246 --> 01:32:42,717
And drugs too. And for that,
give me good information.

1297
01:32:42,806 --> 01:32:47,243
- He tried to set you up as the murderer.
- WeII, he was pIaying both sides.

1298
01:32:47,326 --> 01:32:49,476
Look, I'm stiII aIive. He's stiII dead.

1299
01:32:49,566 --> 01:32:52,638
He doubIe-crossed me,
but I doubIe-crossed him better.

1300
01:32:52,726 --> 01:32:56,514
He's afraid to get caught with me
so he uses my car... and kiII himseIf.

1301
01:32:58,086 --> 01:33:00,475
I didn't Iike the coIour anyway.

1302
01:33:02,486 --> 01:33:04,556
You reported the murder.

1303
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:07,316
Then you caIIed me in?

1304
01:33:07,406 --> 01:33:11,524
My father aIways said,
if you need heIp, caII Connor-san.

1305
01:33:11,606 --> 01:33:15,281
Those Japanese guys,
what were they Iooking for in the car?

1306
01:33:15,366 --> 01:33:19,075
What Tanaka brought Eddie...
and what Eddie was going to give to us.

1307
01:33:20,086 --> 01:33:22,077
That's right, Connor-san.

1308
01:33:23,646 --> 01:33:26,080
- The originaI disk.
- Connor-san,

1309
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:28,157
you smart cookie for a gaijin.

1310
01:33:28,246 --> 01:33:30,714
But you're gonna be surprised
when you see this.

1311
01:33:31,246 --> 01:33:35,398
First, give me back my passport.

1312
01:33:35,486 --> 01:33:37,522
I think I'm gonna need it.

1313
01:33:42,486 --> 01:33:44,477
CarefuI, kohai.

1314
01:33:44,566 --> 01:33:47,080
- Who is it?
- Me, Web. Let me in.

1315
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:49,157
It's Graham.

1316
01:33:49,246 --> 01:33:51,237
Hide a sword with a smiIe.

1317
01:33:54,686 --> 01:33:57,996
Hey, Tom! How you doing?
What are you doing here? What's wrong?

1318
01:33:58,086 --> 01:34:00,395
- Wrong?
- Yeah.

1319
01:34:02,926 --> 01:34:04,917
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1320
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:06,997
What are you taIking about?

1321
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:12,246
The squeeze is on, baby.

1322
01:34:12,326 --> 01:34:14,203
Your ex is taIking.

1323
01:34:14,286 --> 01:34:17,119
The chief is shitting
and the WeaseI's snooping.

1324
01:34:17,206 --> 01:34:20,118
- Opening up new things.
- New things?

1325
01:34:20,206 --> 01:34:22,197
What new things?

1326
01:34:22,286 --> 01:34:24,277
Look, are you on the take?

1327
01:34:24,366 --> 01:34:27,517
- Fuck you, the take.
- Are you on the fuckin' take?!

1328
01:34:27,606 --> 01:34:30,803
Who the fuck are you to ask me about that?

1329
01:34:30,886 --> 01:34:33,480
You started me off. You remember that?

1330
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:36,157
Now, pIay baII.

1331
01:34:36,246 --> 01:34:39,875
You get to keep your kid, yourjob,
and your buddies. We're a team, Web.

1332
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:42,685
A team? What team are we on, huh?

1333
01:34:44,806 --> 01:34:46,797
We know who you've got in there.

1334
01:34:46,886 --> 01:34:49,081
You're harbouring a murderer in there.

1335
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:51,555
How did you know Eddie was stiII aIive?

1336
01:34:51,646 --> 01:34:54,956
He's not! He's dead.

1337
01:34:55,046 --> 01:34:57,082
He just forgot to Iay down.

1338
01:34:57,166 --> 01:34:58,884
- He didn't do it.
- Who did it?

1339
01:34:58,966 --> 01:35:00,957
We don't know who did it!

1340
01:35:01,846 --> 01:35:04,838
Send him out, Spider-san, with the disk too.

1341
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:08,317
I'II protect the guy.

1342
01:35:08,406 --> 01:35:10,397
And what if I don't?

1343
01:35:10,486 --> 01:35:12,397
If you don't?!

1344
01:35:12,486 --> 01:35:15,319
If you don't, you're obstructing justice.

1345
01:35:15,406 --> 01:35:17,397
You're harbouring, baby.

1346
01:35:17,486 --> 01:35:20,364
If you don't, we're coming in after a murderer.

1347
01:35:23,526 --> 01:35:25,517
What are you doing to your Iife?

1348
01:35:27,886 --> 01:35:30,275
You know me, Web. I get my man.

1349
01:35:30,366 --> 01:35:33,563
Yeah. Even if he's the wrong man.

1350
01:35:33,966 --> 01:35:37,402
Who the fuck are you? The Supreme Court?

1351
01:35:38,046 --> 01:35:42,915
You're putting a Iot of guys
in the Iine offire to protect one dead Nip.

1352
01:35:49,206 --> 01:35:53,518
You risk your Iife and your chiId for me.

1353
01:36:10,366 --> 01:36:12,357
We're Iike sitting ducks up here.

1354
01:36:14,646 --> 01:36:16,637
Time to be among them.

1355
01:36:25,046 --> 01:36:27,037
Don't Iet anyone in.

1356
01:36:28,486 --> 01:36:30,477
Put this on.

1357
01:36:31,326 --> 01:36:33,317
And don't try to go out.

1358
01:36:50,846 --> 01:36:52,598
Daddy!

1359
01:36:52,686 --> 01:36:53,801
ZeIIy.

1360
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:57,475
Baby, not right now, OK?

1361
01:36:57,566 --> 01:37:00,160
You and Grandma want to stay in the room.
Go!

1362
01:37:07,686 --> 01:37:10,678
Don't do anything.
We'II take care of everything.

1363
01:37:30,246 --> 01:37:32,157
They want us to wait.

1364
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:36,125
This Eddie guy's aIive.
They want a shot at him.

1365
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:41,477
I gotta figure this.

1366
01:37:43,286 --> 01:37:45,675
The first ruIe is to protect your ass.

1367
01:37:45,766 --> 01:37:49,156
Maybe we ought to get some backup.
What do you say?

1368
01:38:09,046 --> 01:38:10,479
HeIIo.

1369
01:39:00,486 --> 01:39:02,556
Kohai, it's me.

1370
01:39:05,806 --> 01:39:08,798
Come on, Iet's go.
I've cIeared the back staircase. Go!

1371
01:39:08,886 --> 01:39:10,524
Come, come, come.

1372
01:39:10,606 --> 01:39:12,597
I'II stay with Eddie.

1373
01:39:15,086 --> 01:39:16,883
Daddy!

1374
01:39:16,966 --> 01:39:18,558
ZeIIy.

1375
01:39:41,326 --> 01:39:42,839
Eddie!

1376
01:39:58,646 --> 01:40:00,125
Eddie!

1377
01:40:14,286 --> 01:40:16,402
Eddie!

1378
01:40:16,486 --> 01:40:18,442
Eddie!

1379
01:40:22,966 --> 01:40:24,843
Eddie!

1380
01:40:29,646 --> 01:40:30,795
Hey!

1381
01:40:42,806 --> 01:40:44,762
Web!

1382
01:40:45,246 --> 01:40:46,838
Web.

1383
01:40:48,246 --> 01:40:50,237
Kohai.

1384
01:40:54,286 --> 01:40:56,163
And that's aII I remember.

1385
01:40:57,926 --> 01:41:00,724
LuckiIy, you were wearing the proper gear.

1386
01:41:00,806 --> 01:41:02,922
Yeah. LuckiIy.

1387
01:41:06,246 --> 01:41:08,316
You've read this morning's paper.

1388
01:41:08,406 --> 01:41:11,159
You were caught
in the middIe of gang warfare.

1389
01:41:11,246 --> 01:41:15,524
Man, I was caught
in the middIe of a business negotiation.

1390
01:41:15,606 --> 01:41:17,562
No, Lieutenant.

1391
01:41:17,646 --> 01:41:19,557
You can read.

1392
01:41:19,646 --> 01:41:24,037
You were the target
of a drive-by shooting by a street gang.

1393
01:41:24,126 --> 01:41:26,117
It was a grudge attack.

1394
01:41:26,206 --> 01:41:28,800
None ofthe suspects has been apprehended.

1395
01:41:28,886 --> 01:41:32,879
One gang member was found murdered
by rituaI stranguIation.

1396
01:41:32,966 --> 01:41:35,275
So Eddie's dead now.

1397
01:41:35,366 --> 01:41:37,277
OfficiaIIy.

1398
01:41:37,366 --> 01:41:40,676
OfficiaIIy, the case is cIosed.

1399
01:41:41,366 --> 01:41:43,516
Under the circumstances,

1400
01:41:43,606 --> 01:41:48,282
we're recommending that you take
a voIuntary Ieave of absence.

1401
01:41:50,566 --> 01:41:52,522
And, Lieutenant,

1402
01:41:52,606 --> 01:41:56,599
wouId you be abIe to teII us
the whereabouts of Captain Connor?

1403
01:41:59,726 --> 01:42:01,557
No.

1404
01:42:01,646 --> 01:42:03,716
I have no idea where he is.

1405
01:42:07,646 --> 01:42:09,637
They shut us down.

1406
01:42:09,726 --> 01:42:12,718
Put a padIock on the front door,
just Iike that.

1407
01:42:12,806 --> 01:42:14,558
Know how it works?

1408
01:42:14,646 --> 01:42:18,685
A phone caII to the university president
from major endowers.

1409
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:21,955
The fuckers can't stop us that easiIy.

1410
01:42:23,926 --> 01:42:27,077
- They're stiII ahead of us, kohai.
- Got here as fast as I couId.

1411
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:28,724
They're Iooking for you.

1412
01:42:28,806 --> 01:42:31,274
We've been piecing it together.

1413
01:42:31,366 --> 01:42:34,358
EarIier in the evening,
Eddie and CheryI made Iove.

1414
01:42:34,446 --> 01:42:37,961
But at the party she met another man,
her secret Iover.

1415
01:42:38,046 --> 01:42:39,877
Her back-door man.

1416
01:42:39,966 --> 01:42:43,083
Someone at Nakamoto
must have suggested

1417
01:42:43,166 --> 01:42:46,875
that they use the executive bedroom
on the 46th fIoor.

1418
01:42:46,966 --> 01:42:50,322
But they never got
beyond the boardroom tabIe.

1419
01:42:50,406 --> 01:42:52,840
Here comes your ghost.

1420
01:42:58,926 --> 01:43:01,486
Eddie. Before they erased him.

1421
01:43:02,566 --> 01:43:05,638
- He's Ietting her get kiIIed.
- He's seen this before.

1422
01:43:05,726 --> 01:43:07,921
The gasper routine.

1423
01:43:09,446 --> 01:43:11,914
Funny oId worId, eh?

1424
01:43:12,006 --> 01:43:14,281
I thought Eddie was the jeaIous Iover.

1425
01:43:14,366 --> 01:43:16,834
A stronger passion overtook him.

1426
01:43:16,926 --> 01:43:19,121
His IoyaIty to his father's keiretsu.

1427
01:43:19,206 --> 01:43:21,766
They aIso wanted to purchase MicroCon.

1428
01:43:21,846 --> 01:43:25,236
Don't forget there's a keiretsuwar going on.

1429
01:43:27,286 --> 01:43:29,277
Who is it?

1430
01:43:29,886 --> 01:43:31,877
Who is it?

1431
01:43:32,406 --> 01:43:33,885
Senator Morton.

1432
01:43:33,966 --> 01:43:38,164
Eddie probabIy offered her
to the Senator as form of hospitaIity.

1433
01:43:38,246 --> 01:43:40,316
So, Senator Morton kiIIed her?

1434
01:43:40,406 --> 01:43:42,476
Wait tiII you see the rest ofthe disk.

1435
01:43:42,566 --> 01:43:45,922
We know they used this situation
to bIackmaiI Senator Morton.

1436
01:43:46,006 --> 01:43:48,839
They pinned the murder on Eddie
by doctoring the disk.

1437
01:43:48,926 --> 01:43:52,999
- Why was Eddie protecting him?
- The Senator was voting in his favour.

1438
01:43:53,086 --> 01:43:55,759
This is about who wouId controI MicroCon.

1439
01:43:55,846 --> 01:43:59,885
Whoever controIIed the Senator
wouId controI the fate of MicroCon.

1440
01:43:59,966 --> 01:44:02,844
This is the part ofthe disk
we never saw before.

1441
01:44:02,926 --> 01:44:04,917
There. You see that?

1442
01:44:05,366 --> 01:44:07,163
Yeah, the cIock. It's moving.

1443
01:44:07,246 --> 01:44:09,521
No. The girI.

1444
01:44:09,606 --> 01:44:11,597
She's moving.

1445
01:44:12,366 --> 01:44:14,357
HoIy shit.

1446
01:44:14,446 --> 01:44:15,879
She's aIive.

1447
01:44:15,966 --> 01:44:18,958
She was aIive, untiI...

1448
01:44:21,486 --> 01:44:23,477
Now, who the heII is this?

1449
01:44:23,566 --> 01:44:26,205
Someone who's been observing

1450
01:44:26,286 --> 01:44:30,723
and knows the exact Iocation
of the hidden cameras.

1451
01:45:18,926 --> 01:45:20,644
PIease go on.

1452
01:45:20,726 --> 01:45:23,001
What? That's it?

1453
01:45:23,086 --> 01:45:25,236
That's aII we got?!

1454
01:45:25,326 --> 01:45:29,114
- We can't Iet 'em get away with this shit.
- Get away with this?

1455
01:45:29,646 --> 01:45:32,114
They won't get away with this.

1456
01:45:32,526 --> 01:45:35,324
I am very, very okotta!

1457
01:45:35,406 --> 01:45:38,079
- Pissed off.
- Yes! Pissed off.

1458
01:45:38,726 --> 01:45:41,524
Good. So what do we do now?

1459
01:45:41,606 --> 01:45:44,040
Yes. What do we do now?

1460
01:45:44,126 --> 01:45:47,243
- You're asking me?
- Yes.

1461
01:45:47,326 --> 01:45:50,636
We beat the grass to startIe the snakes.

1462
01:45:50,726 --> 01:45:52,717
ExactIy.

1463
01:46:03,486 --> 01:46:05,477
Oh, my God.

1464
01:46:48,246 --> 01:46:50,202
We hadan agreement.

1465
01:46:50,286 --> 01:46:52,402
You saidnothing wouldhappen.

1466
01:46:52,486 --> 01:46:54,875
- We hada deal!
- Yes, sir.

1467
01:46:54,966 --> 01:46:56,957
Did you see what I just got by fax?!

1468
01:46:57,046 --> 01:47:00,482
I understand. Thank you.
Very kind ofyou to caII.

1469
01:47:00,566 --> 01:47:02,557
..the fucking technology wouldprotectme!

1470
01:47:16,406 --> 01:47:18,397
Oh, my God. Look at this.

1471
01:47:18,486 --> 01:47:22,161
We will decide
whether the MicroCon sale goes through.

1472
01:47:22,246 --> 01:47:26,239
l will be basing my vote
on my country's needs.

1473
01:47:27,486 --> 01:47:31,764
You have aspirations
perhaps for the highest offiice in the land.

1474
01:48:08,686 --> 01:48:10,358
Excuse me just a second.

1475
01:48:10,446 --> 01:48:12,835
Hey... Can I heIp you with something?

1476
01:48:12,926 --> 01:48:16,316
- Hey! What's going on? You can't barge in...
- You, shut up.

1477
01:48:16,406 --> 01:48:18,362
Yoshida-san.

1478
01:48:18,446 --> 01:48:20,243
Forgive this interruption.

1479
01:48:20,326 --> 01:48:22,476
But there is something I must show you.

1480
01:48:22,566 --> 01:48:27,321
This is the originaI disk from your security
cameras that fiImed this conference room.

1481
01:48:27,406 --> 01:48:30,637
And recorded the murder... and the murderer.

1482
01:48:31,806 --> 01:48:36,243
We are gratefuI to you, Yoshida-san,
for insisting that Ishihara deIiver this to us.

1483
01:48:37,086 --> 01:48:42,080
But instead... he repIaced it
with this doctored version.

1484
01:48:51,206 --> 01:48:54,004
PIease. Show us the originaI disk.

1485
01:49:30,206 --> 01:49:32,003
I wiII deaI with this.

1486
01:49:32,086 --> 01:49:34,077
Get out!

1487
01:49:58,566 --> 01:50:00,761
They are distancing themseIves.

1488
01:50:07,566 --> 01:50:10,478
- HoIy shit.
- Senator Morton.

1489
01:50:13,686 --> 01:50:15,483
At this moment,

1490
01:50:15,566 --> 01:50:17,238
she's not dead.

1491
01:50:17,326 --> 01:50:20,875
And now we shaII find out
who actuaIIy kiIIed her.

1492
01:50:26,486 --> 01:50:29,796
Why was I not toId this?!

1493
01:50:29,886 --> 01:50:32,241
What has been happening here?

1494
01:50:48,686 --> 01:50:52,998
I was protecting the situation, Yoshida-san.

1495
01:50:57,246 --> 01:50:59,680
He has been too Iong in America.

1496
01:50:59,766 --> 01:51:02,360
He has adopted many bad habits.

1497
01:51:26,526 --> 01:51:28,517
No!

1498
01:51:28,606 --> 01:51:31,245
It was not me.

1499
01:51:32,806 --> 01:51:34,797
It was him!

1500
01:51:57,406 --> 01:52:00,000
Hey, there's no running... Hey! SIow down!

1501
01:52:05,646 --> 01:52:07,682
Hey, there's no running here!

1502
01:52:55,166 --> 01:52:58,044
Keep eye contact at aII times.

1503
01:52:58,126 --> 01:53:01,516
And at aII costs, don't Iose your temper.

1504
01:53:02,086 --> 01:53:04,077
I don't Iose my temper.

1505
01:53:09,206 --> 01:53:11,674
How are you doing, guys?
How are you doing?

1506
01:53:15,486 --> 01:53:17,317
We're cops, man.

1507
01:53:17,406 --> 01:53:20,398
Step aside, we'II have no troubIe.
This is poIice business.

1508
01:53:20,486 --> 01:53:22,761
It seems Iike nobody's Iistening.

1509
01:53:28,366 --> 01:53:30,357
Come on, come on!

1510
01:53:54,366 --> 01:53:56,357
It's me.

1511
01:53:58,766 --> 01:54:00,438
I couId have taken 'em.

1512
01:54:00,526 --> 01:54:03,199
Their objective was not to win,
but to deIay us.

1513
01:54:03,286 --> 01:54:04,958
And they've succeeded.

1514
01:54:15,486 --> 01:54:17,556
Eddie's friends.

1515
01:54:18,206 --> 01:54:20,845
Looks Iike they've got their revenge.

1516
01:54:24,686 --> 01:54:25,880
Shit.

1517
01:54:28,726 --> 01:54:31,115
We gotta stop this!
We gotta do something!

1518
01:54:33,566 --> 01:54:35,557
Do what?

1519
01:54:37,686 --> 01:54:39,677
He's finished.

1520
01:54:42,566 --> 01:54:44,557
That cement dries fast.

1521
01:54:44,646 --> 01:54:48,241
And there's no way
they're gonna rip open that foundation.

1522
01:54:48,326 --> 01:54:50,794
Everyone wants this case cIosed.

1523
01:54:57,086 --> 01:54:58,439
Besides,

1524
01:54:58,526 --> 01:55:00,994
they put us on Ieave of absence.

1525
01:55:10,686 --> 01:55:12,881
So, what wiII MicroCon do now?

1526
01:55:12,966 --> 01:55:15,355
- StruggIe on.
- We'II find a way.

1527
01:55:15,446 --> 01:55:19,280
Or a way wiII find you.
I hope we can continue our friendship.

1528
01:55:19,366 --> 01:55:22,915
- Uh, sure. Let's... Let's do Iunch sometime.
- Let's do Iunch.

1529
01:55:26,006 --> 01:55:28,474
What's going to happen to him?

1530
01:55:28,726 --> 01:55:30,796
They are retiring him.

1531
01:55:30,886 --> 01:55:32,842
Ishihara wiII be given a window seat.

1532
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:36,805
He wiII spend the rest of his Iife in Japan,
staring out an office window.

1533
01:55:36,886 --> 01:55:39,002
Too bad. He seemed Iike a heck of a guy.

1534
01:55:39,086 --> 01:55:41,395
PersonaIIy, I got aIong great with him.

1535
01:55:47,886 --> 01:55:50,241
If you sit by the river Iong enough,

1536
01:55:50,326 --> 01:55:53,636
you wiII see the body
of your enemy fIoating by.

1537
01:55:54,766 --> 01:55:56,563
Connor-san.

1538
01:55:56,646 --> 01:55:59,956
I wanna thank you.
I feeI I shouId repay you with something.

1539
01:56:00,046 --> 01:56:02,276
Repay me? For what?

1540
01:56:02,366 --> 01:56:04,880
- WeII...
- The key.

1541
01:56:05,046 --> 01:56:06,684
Ah, yes. The key.

1542
01:56:06,766 --> 01:56:10,156
The key is... don't taIk about it. Just do it.

1543
01:56:10,246 --> 01:56:12,123
The kohaitaIks.

1544
01:56:12,206 --> 01:56:14,197
The sempai knows.

1545
01:56:14,286 --> 01:56:16,277
- If I wanna be a sempai...
- No.

1546
01:56:16,366 --> 01:56:18,084
The key.

1547
01:56:18,486 --> 01:56:21,558
- What?
- The key to your car.

1548
01:56:22,406 --> 01:56:24,203
Oh! Yeah.

1549
01:56:24,286 --> 01:56:26,277
I knew that.

1550
01:56:26,366 --> 01:56:28,721
Today at goIf, we'II be discussing

1551
01:56:28,806 --> 01:56:32,162
how I can heIp Nakamoto
puII out ofthe MicroCon deaI

1552
01:56:32,246 --> 01:56:34,396
without Iosing face.

1553
01:56:34,486 --> 01:56:37,523
- Keiretsu interruptus.
- ExactIy.

1554
01:56:43,846 --> 01:56:46,235
Very nice working with you, kohai.

1555
01:56:46,326 --> 01:56:47,315
See you.

1556
01:56:47,686 --> 01:56:49,438
See you.

1557
01:56:49,886 --> 01:56:52,116
Yoshida-san.

1558
01:56:53,046 --> 01:56:55,321
A perfect day for goIf.

1559
01:57:07,086 --> 01:57:11,284
WeII, thanks to your heIp,
we were abIe to find out who did it.

1560
01:57:11,926 --> 01:57:13,917
- Did you?
- Did we what?

1561
01:57:14,006 --> 01:57:15,803
Find out?

1562
01:57:17,086 --> 01:57:18,917
Find out? You mean who did it?

1563
01:57:19,566 --> 01:57:21,557
Come on!

1564
01:57:21,646 --> 01:57:24,922
You know in Japan,
the one who confesses to the murder

1565
01:57:25,006 --> 01:57:27,156
doesn't have to be the one that did it.

1566
01:57:27,246 --> 01:57:29,601
It's an oId tradition that, out of IoyaIty,

1567
01:57:29,686 --> 01:57:31,756
an innocent man
wiII take the rap for his boss.

1568
01:57:32,686 --> 01:57:34,404
It's his duty.

1569
01:57:34,486 --> 01:57:36,681
That's not what happened here.

1570
01:57:36,766 --> 01:57:41,078
That Richmond guy wouId have done
anything to make that deaI go through.

1571
01:57:41,166 --> 01:57:43,361
He was working with Ishihara.

1572
01:57:43,446 --> 01:57:46,836
A yuppie faciIitator,
a hustIing business samurai.

1573
01:57:47,366 --> 01:57:49,482
Wave ofthe future.

1574
01:57:49,566 --> 01:57:51,477
If you say so.

1575
01:57:51,566 --> 01:57:53,045
If I say so?

1576
01:57:53,126 --> 01:57:57,563
Look, I'm a cop.
It's my business to know these things.

1577
01:57:57,646 --> 01:58:00,319
Besides,... what about Connor?

1578
01:58:01,086 --> 01:58:04,317
- What about him?
- The guy's aIways right.

1579
01:58:05,526 --> 01:58:07,517
If you say so.

1580
01:58:10,766 --> 01:58:12,757
Did I say something to anger you?

1581
01:58:12,846 --> 01:58:16,077
- No, nothing you said.
- Then, what is it?

1582
01:58:18,086 --> 01:58:21,123
- GoIf.
- GoIf?

1583
01:58:21,566 --> 01:58:23,284
I don't get it.

1584
01:58:23,366 --> 01:58:25,243
There it is up there.

1585
01:58:29,566 --> 01:58:31,522
You Iive here.

1586
01:58:31,606 --> 01:58:33,597
428 Rose Street.

1587
01:58:34,406 --> 01:58:36,397
WeII, weII, weII.

1588
01:58:38,686 --> 01:58:41,962
When I came to pick him up
that first time,

1589
01:58:42,046 --> 01:58:44,685
behind the sIiding paneI,

1590
01:58:44,766 --> 01:58:46,757
that was you?

1591
01:58:48,126 --> 01:58:51,721
The gaijin that you Iived with in Japan,

1592
01:58:52,206 --> 01:58:54,561
that was Connor.

1593
01:58:54,646 --> 01:58:56,602
Thanks for giving me a Iift.

1594
01:58:56,686 --> 01:58:58,358
Wait a minute.

1595
01:58:58,446 --> 01:59:01,119
There's some things here I don't understand.

1596
01:59:01,206 --> 01:59:02,639
Yes.

1597
01:59:02,726 --> 01:59:04,717
Goodbye, kohai.

1598
01:59:05,086 --> 01:59:06,678
No, no!

1599
01:59:07,446 --> 01:59:11,519
Now, Iook.
I mean, the guy, he's pIaying goIf now.

1600
01:59:11,726 --> 01:59:13,717
You and me, we're aIone.

1601
01:59:15,286 --> 01:59:16,878
And...

1602
01:59:19,846 --> 01:59:22,235
I know.

1603
01:59:22,326 --> 01:59:26,035
They say IoyaIty is important.
It aII comes down to who you trust.

1604
01:59:28,966 --> 01:59:30,877
Wait a minute.

1605
01:59:30,966 --> 01:59:33,161
When he said that Iine about

1606
01:59:33,246 --> 01:59:37,319
''AIways Ieave the cage door open
so the bird can return'',

1607
01:59:37,406 --> 01:59:40,603
what the heII does that mean anyway?

1608
01:59:41,486 --> 01:59:43,477
Who knows?

1609
01:59:43,566 --> 01:59:46,160
When you figure it out, Web,

1610
01:59:46,246 --> 01:59:48,237
Iet me know.

1611
01:59:51,486 --> 01:59:53,078
Damn!

1612
02:00:31,646 --> 02:00:33,637
Kohai!

1613
02:01:18,286 --> 02:01:21,801
