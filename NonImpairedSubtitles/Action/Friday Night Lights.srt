00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,278
It's Mojo Radio back on the air.
Slammin'Sammy here.

3
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:14,324
Football time in Texas.
Let's go to the phone.
We got, uh, Butch on the line with us.

4
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,994
Butch, what about it?
We'll have a great year, or what?

5
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,038
 How you doin'?
 Good, Butch.
Tell me about this season.

6
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:24,918
 We're gonna
have a hell of a season this year.!
Winchell's gonna take us all the way.

7
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:29,298
- Deep slant tripps stacked right?
- Primary receiver's inside flanker.

8
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,009
- "Z" burst.
- My linemen are an 80 pass block.

9
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,970
- How deep is your drop?
- Five steps.

10
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,806
Five steps.
Tripps stacked left?

11
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,059
I nside eight-yard curl.
You gonna get a scholarship?

12
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:45,439
Yes, Mom.
"Z"receiver.

13
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:51,445
It's Mojo Radio, Slammin'Sammy,
and I've got Jerry on the line with us
from the Sonic down there.

14
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,407
Jerry, there's a lot of talk
that Coach Gaines,

15
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,576
with that $60,000 a year salary...

16
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,080
 I know where we're goin' with this.
 He makes a little bit more
than the principal of the school.

17
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,584
I read the book... Just last week,
I was readin'this book about Babe Ruth,

18
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,462
and they asked him
if he deserved his salary...

19
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:13,759
way back in 1910... 04, whatever it was,
and he said, "Hey, you know..."

20
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:18,597
They said, " You make more than
the president. "He says," Well, you know,
can the president hit a baseball?"

21
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,727
I'm tellin'you right now, you know,
Coach Gary Gaines, they could give him
$ 100,000 a year,

22
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,856
and if these boys go undefeated,
it's worth every single dollar.

23
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,610
I tell you what, the principal,
uh, of Permian
don't get 28,000 people...

24
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,864
 I got two
to three seconds of rotation and
my linemen are an 80 pass block.

25
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:39,785
Wide receiver?
He runs the... burst route.

26
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:45,082
If he sees cover two, he...
he bends outside, eight to 12 yards.

27
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,876
20 yards, and runs
straight to the sideline.

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,712
Are you ready for this, Mike?

29
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,805
- "
- Yo. Ivory!

30
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,268
Ready to work?

31
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,353
'Sup, Boobie? State.

32
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,231
State? State?

33
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,317
State. State.
State.

34
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,164
Where your girlfriend at, Water Bug?

35
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,250
Well...
We ain't got a girlfriend yet?

36
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:16,006
- Come on. Let's go. Snap it up.
- You wanna know why
you ain't got a girl yet, Water Bug?

37
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,093
- Why?
- You got the wrong shoes on, man.

38
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:27,226
You got on white Adidas.
Everybody know the shoe is Nikes.

39
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,854
Nothin' holds a nickel next to Nike.
Ask Ivory. Ask Preacher Man.

40
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,691
- What kind of shoes
on your feet don't matter.
- Come on, Preacher. Bullshit!

41
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:38,278
- Don't matter at all.
- You know God made black beautiful.

42
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,740
God made Boobie beautiful,
black and strong.

43
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,202
His mouth keeps gettin'
bigger and bigger and bigger.

44
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:49,957
And when Boobie knocks some fools out,
Boobie gonna knock 'em out with
black Nikes on his feet. Ain't that right?

45
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,209
I could knock you out
in a pair of flip-flops.

46
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,462
Yeah, well, I'm gonna knock 'em out
with Nikes on my feet,

47
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,548
and I'm gonna smile when I do.

48
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,531
Let's go. Five minutes. Let's go.

49
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,194
Get up. Let's go.

50
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:14,082
How y'all doin' up there?
Y'all doin' all right?

51
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:18,170
45, Boobie...
That's my nephew out there.

52
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,672
The boy can play some football.
I'm telling you.

53
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,717
 I think he'll win
the Heisman Trophy someday.
 The Heisman, really?

54
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,261
- Oh, yes sir. You can bet on it.
- I got it.! I got it.!

55
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,639
Who's you guys'favorite player?
- Boobie Miles.

56
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,684
He can spin left. He can spin right.
Don't make no difference.

57
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,855
He can block, tackle,
score the touchdown, snap the ball,

58
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,441
hold the snap
and kick the extra point.

59
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:44,154
Hell, the boy will fill up
the Gatorade cooler, walk the dog,
and paint your back porch.

60
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:49,868
I'm telling you, that boy
can flat out play football.

61
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,957
Ow! And he can pass!

62
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,335
Should we believe the hype?
What hype?

63
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:02,256
- The hype about Boobie Miles.
- No, hype is something
that's not for real.

64
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,800
- I'm all real.

65
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,806
I'm Chris Comer. I'm a running back.
So that means you're Boobie's backup?

66
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,892
I'm actually Boobie's backup backup.
I'm third string right now.

67
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,062
- You know which way
you're supposed to run?
- Yeah, with strong right...

68
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,107
I ain't talkin' about the play.
I know what the play was, okay?

69
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,817
I know what the play was, okay?

70
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,987
Odessa's a small town, and, uh,

71
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,906
if you screw up,
everybody knows about it.

72
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,618
Your dad played at Permian.
What's it like to be the son
of a local legend?

73
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,496
- Hold on to the damn ball, Donnie!

74
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,957
Next question.

75
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,460
There it goes.! There it is.!
How are your grades, Boobie?

76
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,671
I get straight A's.
I'm an athlete.

77
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,466
In what subject?
There's only one subject.
It's football.

78
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,261
- Ain't no other subject,
you know?
- Hut!

79
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,516
- Hang on to the ball.! The ball.!

80
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,019
You sure he's part of
your gene pool, Charlie?

81
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,188
Shit.

82
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,191
Red alert.
Red alert, everybody.

83
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:06,528
What about the expectations
of coaching a team like this
in a community like this?

84
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,240
Well, I guess there's always
a surprise or two in every community.

85
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,076
Ball. J ust concentrate on
hangin' on the ball. Both hands.

86
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,412
Hey, Donnie. Hey.

87
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:19,708
- Come here. Come here.
What's the problem?
- Get off the field, Dad.

88
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,170
Why can't you hold on to the football?
What's so goddamn hard
about holdin' on to it?

89
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,673
- I'm sorry.
- All you gotta do is hold on to the
goddamn football, and you can't do it.

90
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:30,511
Tell me why you can't do it.
J ust tell me. That's all I wanna know.

91
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:33,347
I'll try better next time.
Come on.
Hey!

92
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,432
 Charlie.!
Don't you walk away from me.

93
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:39,269
- Leave him alone.
- Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talkin'to you, you hear me?

94
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,480
Tell me why you can't
hold on to the ball.!
 Enough.!

95
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,649
Tell me. Answer a question.
Mr. Billingsley.

96
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,818
- It's the first day of practice.
- This is practice. Seriously.

97
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,738
- Enough. Charlie!

98
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,241
Embarrassin' me out here.
Jesus Christ.

99
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,202
It's all right, Don.

100
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,251
 It's all right.
Don't worry about it. Here we go.

101
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:06,088
Slot right. 38...
Billingsley, you ain't gotta worry
about holdin' on to the ball, man.

102
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,966
- Why's that?
- 'Cause you ain't gonna get the ball.

103
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,970
Your job is to be blockin' for Boobie.
I don't care if your daddy
is over there cryin'.

104
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,180
- You can...
- You never shut up, do you?

105
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:19,393
Our team's been playin' with each other
for a long time and, uh,

106
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,937
we got the brotherhood
part of it down pretty much.

107
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,234
People here at Permian are already
predicting a state championship.

108
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,778
Is there any pressure to that
for you guys?

109
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:33,740
Well, any time they start predictin'
the state championships,
there's always pressure, believe me.

110
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,536
You guys don't have a lot of size.
How can you make up for that?

111
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,874
We're gonna rely on our speed,
discipline.

112
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,836
Come on, Ivory.
You're in the game now.
You're in the game.

113
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,423
Do football players
get special treatment here?

114
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,012
What do you have to do
to be a better football player this year?

115
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,097
Do you enjoy playing football?

116
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,228
You quit reading
your press clippings, all right?

117
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,732
Because you're smaller,
and you're gonna be smaller every week.

118
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,610
- Yo, Boobie Miles!
- It is hard to be humble.

119
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,613
Ain't gonna be no growth spurt
between now and the first game.

120
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,740
Where does all that anger
come from?

121
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,245
- They're gonna underestimate you
every single week.

122
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:23,123
- We teach you this technique
for a reason.

123
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:26,543
We do not do this
to make our heads rattle.

124
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,962
You're gonna use your mind.

125
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:32,007
You're gonna play with your heart.
Come on.!

126
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,678
That's what you're gonna use
to win the state championship.

127
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:44,144
Get up, Ivory. Get up.
Get up! Get up.

128
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:55,781
It's a good day, gentlemen.
It's a good day to think
about responsibility.

129
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,326
It's a good day to ask yourself
if on a personal level you're willing
to accept that...

130
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,787
if you're willing to accept
the responsibility that you have...

131
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,124
to protect this team
and this school and this town.

132
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,127
And make no mistake
about it, gentlemen,

133
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,588
we are in the business
of protecting this town.

134
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,592
We're in the business
of winning.

135
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,554
The expectations
couldn't be any higher.

136
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:22,182
We will win state.

137
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:26,061
We will win state.

138
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,404
Can you be perfect?

139
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,995
Mojo.!

140
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,792
No, I'm all right.
Come on, Mike. Live a little.

141
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,587
He's not going out, either.
Yeah, he is.

142
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,674
Mike, you're going out tonight.
If I have anything to say about it,
you're gonna get laid too.

143
00:11:55,757 --> 00:12:00,012
Billingsley.! Billingsley.!
Party at Taylor's house now, Billingsley.!

144
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:04,391
You better be there. Gonna get wasted.!
Party at Taylor's house.!

145
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,810
Billingsley!

146
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,107
Isn't that guy, like, 35?

147
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,402
Mike. Here's your mom's food.

148
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,822
How much?
No, no. Don't worry about it.
It's on us. It's on us.

149
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,450
How's she doin', by the way?
You never give me free food, David.

150
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,494
- I just gave you free food.
- Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

151
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,456
- Say hi to your mom, huh?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

152
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,666
Stay out of jail, Billingsley.

153
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,836
- We're not goin' home, Mike.
- I ain't goin' out drunk foolin'.

154
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,422
How 'bout I bring
your mom some dinner
so you can come out with us?

155
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:39,426
Because we're gonna get laid,
and we're gonna get drunk, and
we're gonna win state, but not tonight.

156
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,512
All right?

157
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,851
You been blessed, Mike,
'cause we got a runner.

158
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:51,647
He's gonna make us all look good.
So I'm telling you to lighten up.

159
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,818
All you gotta do is exist in those
two seconds between snap
and you givin' Boobie the ball.

160
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,738
So lighten up, Mike.
Mike.

161
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,200
How you doin'?
Hey, Brian.

162
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,953
How's old Gaines treatin' you?
Got you all perfect?
We gettin' there.

163
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,205
All right.
How's your mama?
Fine, sir.

164
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:12,209
- All right. You mind if we get a shot
real quick with the kid, little picture?
- Shot?

165
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,294
Yeah, little picture.
Yeah, sure.

166
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,797
Here. All right, sweetie.
J ust take a picture.

167
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,759
My baby girl and the next Texas
state championship quarterback, huh?

168
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,596
Where's the damn camera?

169
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,058
Winchell, boy, you remember
every minute of this.
I'm tellin'you right now.

170
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,312
You're 17, but it goes fast.
Don't sleep. Don't waste a second of it.

171
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,274
'Cause before you know it,
it's done.

172
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,318
Nothin' but babies and memories.
You hear me?

173
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:43,240
Babies and memories.
Smile, sweetheart. Give us a smile.
Say "Mojo." Say "Mojo."

174
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:48,745
I tell you what, why don't
you hold on to her for a little while?
Babysit her for us for a couple hours.

175
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,415
We're gonna go get a drink.
We'll be back in a little bit.

176
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,376
All right. I'm kiddin' with ya.
Come here. Come here, sweet...

177
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,172
Come here, sweetie.
Let's go back over to Mama.
All right.

178
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:01,842
Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, hey. Bring it home, huh?

179
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,178
Bring one of these home.
Get you one of these.

180
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:09,224
Christian, get you one of these.
Boys? Right here.

181
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:17,232
Come up here a second.
Got some change for you.

182
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,574
Wanna go to that party?
J ust for a little bit?

183
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,663
"It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time"

184
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:35,292
"It's tricky
It's tricky, tricky"
"Tricky, tricky"

185
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:38,587
"It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time"

186
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,424
"It's tricky"
"T-t-t-tricky, tricky"

187
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,010
"I met this little girlie
Her hair was..."

188
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:51,517
What I saw was speed out there,
but uh, where's the beef, Coach?

189
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,602
I saw me some small boys.
They're small.

190
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,647
- I think we're gonna be okay.
- On defense?

191
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,692
Yes, ma'am. I firmly believe that.
We got some backs.
We're about, what, 180?

192
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,948
"Tricky, tricky, tricky"

193
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:09,910
"It's tricky to rock a rhyme
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky"

194
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,079
Hi, Mike.

195
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,665
I'm Melissa.
I know who you are.

196
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,959
You do?
Everybody knows
who you are, Melissa.

197
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:20,212
Everybody knows
who you are, Mike.

198
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,256
Is that right?

199
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,843
- Whole lot of... Arab oil embargo.
- Oh, God.

200
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,720
- Don't talk about that.
- Midland Lee likes to bust it
up the middle, too.

201
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,098
You're right about that.
You know what you should do?

202
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:34,977
You should play Boobie Miles defense.
Work him both ways.

203
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,564
The problem with that is
I don't want to get him hurt.
We need him to score touchdowns.

204
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:41,275
Bullshit. That big nigger
ain't gonna break.

205
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,987
You wanna beat Midland Lee,
you play him middle linebacker.

206
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,532
- Break some heads out there.
- Are you ready for Midland Lee, coach?

207
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:54,121
"I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it"

208
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:59,084
This is not about Boobie. This is
about the fact that we're sittin'here
in the stairwell while they're up there.

209
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:02,129
- I wanna be with a ball carrier.
- Baby, Boobie is...

210
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,841
Don't you "Baby, Boobie" me.
I wanna see somethin'.

211
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,760
Can I get a touchdown?
How 'bout that?
Can I get a touchdown?

212
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:12,514
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
I don't know.

213
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,017
Why doesn't he have a girlfriend?

214
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,397
Is that a rule or somethin'?

215
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:26,195
No, not really.
Well, then,
why don't you have a girlfriend?

216
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,698
J ust don't.
Are you gay?

217
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,825
- What?
- Is he gay?

218
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:37,247
- I'm not gay.
- Can you prove it?

219
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:42,461
Coach, here's to the start of
your second season as our head coach.

220
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:46,381
- We're here,
we believe in you and Sharon.
- Thank you.

221
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:50,385
To sittin' here in December
as the state champions of Texas.

222
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,263
- Let's bring 'em hell. Go Mojo!
- Go Mojo!

223
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:56,141
- Go Mojo!
Bring us some glory, Coach.

224
00:16:56,225 --> 00:17:01,188
- " That's what I say
Don't need nothin'but a good time"
- Go! Go! Go!

225
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,404
Why isn't anyone allowed
at your house?

226
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,407
People come over.

227
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,826
When?

228
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,039
Is your mother really crazy?

229
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,334
No.

230
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,503
Are you crazy?

231
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,923
Do I look crazy?

232
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:31,844
Look like someone who's gonna get
the hell out of Odessa, Texas one day
and never look back.

233
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:35,264
Seriously works for me.

234
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,486
See ya.

235
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,329
Get in here, boy.

236
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,583
Come on. Get this off.
Ow.

237
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,128
That's good.

238
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,672
Ow!

239
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:12,092
Take my shoes...

240
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,605
Don't get so prude.
Stop. We're on your couch.

241
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:28,525
Something for everybody. Oh.

242
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,196
Let's go to your room.

243
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:37,367
Let's go to your bedroom.
Dad, can you just go
back to bed, please?

244
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,828
Who's this? This Melissa?

245
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,372
Yes.
Maria.

246
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:46,502
How you doin', Maria?
Damn, girl. You have grown up.

247
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,546
Dad, please.
Can you just go back to bed?

248
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,425
What happened to my lamp?

249
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:57,971
- Hey, y'all. What's goin'on?
- Hey, Flippy.

250
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,015
Hi, Maria.
What happened to my lamp?

251
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,894
I dropped it.
Yeah, you dropped it.

252
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:09,566
That makes perfect sense, huh?
He dropped it. Can't hold on to
the lamp, can't hold on to the football.

253
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:13,153
- I can hold on to the football, Dad,
now get the hell out of here!

254
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,409
Little fumble,
can't hold on to the football.

255
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,955
Since when can you hold
on to the football?

256
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,791
I haven't seen it.
Y'all don't do it today?

257
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,545
How about yesterday? You hold on
to the football yesterday? Have you
seen him hold on to the football?

258
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:33,090
How 'bout tomorrow?
You gonna hold on to it tomorrow?
How 'bout now?

259
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,592
Can you hold on...
Hold on to the football.
Goddamn it, Dad.

260
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:40,013
- Dad.
- Maybe this'll help.

261
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,934
 What are you doing?
Hold... on... to... the football!

262
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:47,187
Dad! Goddamn it, Dad!
Knock it off!

263
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,773
- That's enough.!

264
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,116
I don't think we've felt this kind of
expectation in years.

265
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,118
If Winchell shows up
like we know he can,

266
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,621
even a short passing game
to give Boobie Miles
a couple of feet of cushion...

267
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,932
You boys all right?
Yes, sir.

268
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,602
Yes, sir.

269
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,854
Gonna win state?
Yes, sir.

270
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,357
Yes, sir.
Undefeated?

271
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,443
Yes, sir.
Get it done.

272
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:38,071
Take this opportunity
to support the Permian Panthers...

273
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:51,502
"The Southern California lifestyle
is but one of the bonus features...

274
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,006
of playing for..."

275
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,967
What's that word?
Uh, "distinguished."

276
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:04,264
- Who's that one from, UCLA?
- No, this is USC.
That's UCLA right there.

277
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:09,770
Hey, Mike. You gonna come visit
my distinguished ass in California?

278
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,064
See if I can put the damn smile
on your face.

279
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,942
You know I'm fittin'
to be rich, right?

280
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:19,530
I'm thinkin'about hiring,
uh, Eddie Murphy
to lay some of his shit on you...

281
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,698
till you crack a damn smile.

282
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,160
No? Well, what about
Richard Pryor?

283
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:28,664
Bill Cosby?
I know you like Bill Cosby.

284
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:32,209
Mike Winchell, you got
a natural ability...

285
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,753
for throwing Boobie Miles the ball.

286
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:38,757
Any every once in a while
you throw a pretty good pass,

287
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:41,051
so you're going to eat
yourJell-O Pudding Pops.

288
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:43,637
Wah!

289
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,977
Yo, Mike Winchell. You gonna move
out of Odessa, Texas one day, baby,

290
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,855
and you gonna come visit
Boobie Miles in California,

291
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:56,191
and you gonna smile,

292
00:21:56,275 --> 00:22:00,195
or I'm gonna stick
about four pudding pops
up your white ass.

293
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,615
- Now, now... Oh, my God.!
I got Mike Winchell to smile.!

294
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:06,451
Look at this! Wah!

295
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,913
Did y'all see it? Wah.!

296
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,624
That's probably the only smile
y'all gonna see from Mike
all season.

297
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,920
Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,298
I'm distinguished now.
Hey, Boobie.

299
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,801
- What?
- You didn't lift.

300
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:26,305
Come on, man.
This is God-given.

301
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,266
Only thing I gotta do
is just show up.

302
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:36,231
Now, people call this monument out here,
the Ratliff Stadium,

303
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:39,026
the monument to football of Odessa.

304
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:42,946
They say some of that money
should have gone to the school.

305
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:47,201
What's your feelings on that, D.U.?
You played ball.

306
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,536
 Ain't that stadium
part of the school?

307
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,498
So I say that money did go to the school.
What's everybody whinin'about?

308
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,126
This is football country, folks.
Come on. Get your heads out.

309
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,297
Hi, Don.
Hey, Karen.

310
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,800
- It's you. Do you like it?
Do you like it?
- Think so. What is it?

311
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:06,720
Rice Krispy.
You like it, right?
Yeah, I love it.

312
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,473
Thanks.
You're welcome.

313
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:14,102
- Hey, Gary?
- Hey, John. How you doin'?

314
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,605
Good. Um, you real busy?

315
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,149
I got a minute or two.
What you got up?

316
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:22,819
- Well, I got some characters out here.
- Well, who you got with you?

317
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:26,490
Wilkins.
Well, hey.
Hey, J im. How you doin'?

318
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,700
- How's that pretty wife of yours?
- She's good.

319
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:31,620
Ready for Friday night?
Sure hope so.
Seems pretty good.

320
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,289
I feel pretty good about it.
I really do.
 We're just, uh...

321
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,333
Wanted to come by and visit,

322
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,919
maybe talk about defense
a little bit, if you got a second.

323
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,004
You got a second?

324
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:45,217
We got a dog named Mojo.
We got a cat named Panther.

325
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,555
 You got season tickets?
 You kiddin'?
We don't miss anything.

326
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:54,893
- I nstead of the cover 2 zone.
- Get the D-line in as many gaps
and stack gaps as possible.

327
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:56,979
Double dent, type of technique.

328
00:23:57,062 --> 00:24:00,315
- Hey, Boobie.
- Hey.

329
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,734
- How you doin'?
- All right.

330
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,613
Strong "B"slide force.
Hell, we can look at...

331
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,283
- He'll still be a robber...
- Get Ivory out of the board...

332
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,120
- And go!
- Go, go, go, go.

333
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:17,291
- Go by the speed and make up
for the size differential...
- What do you think, Coach?

334
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:29,219
Now, obviously we're not Division I,
but we got a good program.

335
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:34,099
You play well enough,
we'll find you a spot at Kansas Wesleyan.

336
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:38,270
- How far is the drive?
- What drive?

337
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:42,065
To your school. How far is it
from Odessa to your school?

338
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:45,068
I don't know. 10 or 12 hours.
Are you offering?

339
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,904
Ma'am?
Right now. Are you offering?

340
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,614
If you are, we're in.
Mom.

341
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,991
He'll sign his intent right now.

342
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:55,871
Well, obviously we're interested,
Miss Winchell, otherwise
we wouldn't be here, Mike.

343
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:59,791
- But right now, that's all we are, is...
- I nterested.

344
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:03,128
Now, you go get at 'em,
you throw some touchdowns,

345
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:07,090
you win some football games,
maybe a state championship, huh?

346
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:09,801
We'll see if we can't find you a home
at Kansas Wesleyan.

347
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,054
Yes, sir.

348
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:15,599
Do you like playin' football, Mike?
Yes, sir.

349
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:17,726
Is it fun for you?

350
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,147
- Lots of fun, sir.
- He loves the game.

351
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:25,067
That's good. It's important.
It's... legitimate love of the game.

352
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,694
Supposed to be fun,
you know?

353
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:29,905
Greatest game in the world.

354
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:38,497
I'm not that good at toastin',
but, uh, I'll give it a try.

355
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,335
Um, fact is I don't know if I've ever
done a toast myself before.
Been involved in a few, but uh...

356
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:47,589
Uh, well, here's to Boobie Miles, who...

357
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:51,635
Well, everything... everything you get
this year, you deserve it,

358
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:55,514
because you... you work hard,
and you... I'm real proud of you.

359
00:25:55,597 --> 00:26:00,477
And, um, L. V., to you l... I can't
even tell you how proud of you I am,

360
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:04,314
the way you've raised this kid
and what you do for him, and uh...

361
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:08,527
Here's to a great season,
and uh, God bless us.

362
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,779
- God bless us.
- God bless.

363
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,761
We been thinkin'about this
for four months now.

364
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:20,432
You seniors have been
thinkin'about it for 17 years.

365
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:23,435
Well, it's here now.
It's time.

366
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:27,564
If any of you have any doubt
in your mind,

367
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:30,108
I don't want you to walk
through that door over there.

368
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:36,156
You shouldn't have any doubt
in your mind about what
you're supposed to do tonight,

369
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,826
and about how
you're supposed to do it.

370
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,792
So let's take care of it!

371
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,795
"

372
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:52,381
"Don't know we can do this
'Cause we always knew this"

373
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:55,425
"Ha, ha
Yeah, boy"

374
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,719
"Bass
How low can you go"

375
00:27:57,803 --> 00:28:00,556
- " Death row
What a brother know"
- Way to go.

376
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,391
- Do you understand?
- Hut!

377
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,394
Boobie Miles.

378
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,315
You can't turn it back
to Boobie Miles!

379
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,485
All Boobie, all the time here.

380
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:17,698
- A Mojo first down.

381
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,867
Boobie around one more.!

382
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,703
- Yeah! That's my boy!
- Boobie Miles for 45 yards...

383
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:25,831
- Score for Mojo. Touchdown.

384
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:29,501
Billingsley takes it right.
Boobie. Here we go again.

385
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,754
Into the end zone.
Touchdown, Mojo.

386
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:36,383
Boobie Miles has it all,
all in one great package...

387
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:39,511
the speed, the size, the athleticism.

388
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:42,389
Let me tell you, folks, Boobie Miles
is worth the price of admission.

389
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,474
Yeah!
Yeah, all right!

390
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:47,519
- Boobie Miles breakin'loose
one more time.
- Yes, sir!

391
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,565
- Broke the line.
Chavez.!

392
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,528
Chavez is playin'like a man possessed.

393
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,240
- Whoo!

394
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:03,660
- God damn, I'm so proud of ya!
- Calm down, son.

395
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,538
- Chavez will eat you...
Billingsley. Hey, Billingsley.

396
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:09,499
Whoo!
Go sit...
Go get on the bench.

397
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,627
Get on the bench.
Boy, crazy.

398
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,880
I like enthusiasm, but my goodness.

399
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:21,929
He's gonna throw it.
What an arm.! Did you see...

400
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,560
Boobie Miles, from 35 yards out,

401
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,646
scores a Mojo touchdown.

402
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:34,274
You're doin' a great job.
Give me a smile. Give me a smile.
Thank you, Coach.

403
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:37,444
Boobie Miles is about as solid
as you can ask for.

404
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:41,114
He ain't gonna smile.
He's more internal.
Why not? Why didn't he ever smile?

405
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,158
 Mojo.! Mojo.!
Keep watchin'out.

406
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:46,995
- Let me kick that extra point.
- Not this time. You did enough.

407
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:52,709
- Come on.
- Chris Comer! Come in.

408
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:56,004
Comer! You're in the game.
Come on.

409
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:59,091
Hey, hey, hey, hey, son. Come here!
Come here! Where you goin'?

410
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:02,219
- You don't want me to go in, Coach?
- You don't want a helmet?

411
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:04,429
Where's your helmet?
Go get it!
Yes, sir!

412
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:07,766
- You see my helmet, man?
- Find your helmet, son.

413
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:11,395
- What you lookin' for, Water Bug?
- Let me get this real quick.
Let me get your helmet, man.

414
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:14,356
Come on, come on.
My goodness gracious.

415
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,317
Boobie.
Water Bug, you can't come out here
with no helmet, man.

416
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:20,571
You seen my helmet right here?
I can't believe it.

417
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:23,198
28 sweep. 28 sweep.

418
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:27,286
You don't know where your helmet is?
What are you thinkin'?
Where did you put your helmet?

419
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:30,330
- Right there a second ago.
- Well, it ain't there!

420
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,958
Do you not know that you
play the game with a helmet on?

421
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,043
- Put your tail end right there.!
- Hut!

422
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,338
He throws back to Miles.

423
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,258
Miles cuts to his right.

424
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:46,221
Bailey takes him down.

425
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,024
Was that a knee?
Could have been.

426
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,610
Hold on. Hold on.

427
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:16,460
 Winchell
was still in there. Billingsley was
still in there. Unfortunately...

428
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:21,507
the running back's been taken down hard
and it looks like a knee could possibly...

429
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,511
- J ust gonna touch the kneecap here.

430
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:27,888
Does it hurt over here, son?

431
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,977
Get up, Boobie.

432
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,237
Let me take a look at this.
Let me look at it.

433
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:04,508
It's definitely his A.C.L.
I mean, it's a legitimate tear.

434
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:10,514
Do you think he tore any cartilage?
Maybe. I could feel the knee catching.

435
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:15,477
What do you think?

436
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:18,689
This kid, it's all about
how he responds mentally.

437
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,024
I don't know.

438
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,961
All right, everybody.
Listen up.

439
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:48,677
He's gonna be fine.
It's not serious. There's no tear.
He'll be back in a week.

440
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,722
That's the good news.

441
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:54,141
Even better news, y'all played
a great football game tonight.

442
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:56,226
A real good football game.

443
00:32:56,268 --> 00:33:00,063
I'm real proud of ya.

444
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:02,399
And Mike...
Where's Mike Winchell?

445
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:04,943
Mike, I'm proud of you, son.

446
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:07,988
You showed discipline.
You showed leadership.

447
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:11,033
You played your butt off, son.
I'm proud of you.

448
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:14,077
All of you. Proud of all of you.
And, uh, Wilson...

449
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,331
Now that's body tackle.
That's what I been tellin'you about.

450
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,499
Did y'all see him tonight?

451
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:26,215
Anyway, I'm proud of every one of you.
I'm proud of the coaches, all of y'all,
each and every player.

452
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:30,594
I want you to go celebrate.
Feel good about yourselves
tonight, okay? Come on!

453
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:52,449
 We only got
a minute and a half left in the game,
we're leadin'by a good lead.

454
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:56,078
He leaves the boy in there like that.
That makes no sense.!

455
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:59,248
You gotta protect your best asset.!
What's the matter with this man?

456
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:01,458
He could have ruined
the whole season for us right there.

457
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,670
We were up. We were winnin'big,
and the boy stays in the game.

458
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:08,757
Yeah.! What's... You don't need any more.
You don't need to accomplish any more.

459
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:12,177
I think Coach Gaines
is a stupid f... in'idiot.

460
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:15,806
 Hey.
 Well, he sh... You know,
he shouldn't have put him in.

461
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,559
I mean, we had a big lead
and everything.

462
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:20,686
I don't understand
what that was all about.

463
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:23,856
We can't do anything without Boobie.
We had the game won...

464
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:26,817
I'm feelin'some damage
on the right side here.

465
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:30,904
- Well, can I play on Friday?
- I think you got a slight tear.

466
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,532
Can he play?
Yeah, can I play?

467
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:36,159
Can he play football?

468
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,203
Can I?

469
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,499
You need to get up to Midland,
get an M.R.I.

470
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,171
Can a M.R.I. fix your knee?

471
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,632
Is he the one player
you can't do without?

472
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:55,679
Well, l... I never looked at it
that way. A football team is not
about one player or two players.

473
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,723
A football team is about the team.

474
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:00,934
This is a unit, and that's
the way we have to play.

475
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:04,313
Uh, it's gonna be a...
It's gonna be a challenge.

476
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,409
You are makin'
some bad decisions!

477
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:23,498
You're playin'like the village idiot.
You want people to think you're
the village idiot? Is that what you want?

478
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:40,349
The Eagles take down
the Panthers, 49-6,

479
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:43,602
and for Coach Gary Gaines,
it's gotta be back to the drawing board.

480
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:46,230
That's gonna be the word
around town all week.

481
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:51,360
Coach Gaines, what are you gonna do?
The loss of Boobie Miles can not
result in the loss of this season.

482
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,963
Hell of a game.
Gimme the keys.

483
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:15,175
Way to take care of business.
Gimme the keys, Dad.

484
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:30,375
We, uh... We just need
a few more days, Coach,
and we be back.

485
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,712
You go into Midland,
get that M.R.I.?

486
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:38,342
I don't need nothin'in Midland.
Those rich hillbillies ain't never seen
nothin'as pretty as Boobie Miles.

487
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:40,802
Them M.R.I. machines
wouldn't know what to do with it.

488
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:44,014
He gonna be just fine, Coach Gaines.

489
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:47,601
Uh, we gonna go back to the clinic
but they already said ain't no tears.

490
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:52,397
No tears?
Ain't no tear.

491
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:56,235
Is that what they said?

492
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:59,571
Yes, sir. Uh, we gonna go back
for some double confirmation,

493
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:05,077
but when it come time
to play Midland Lee,
we be good to go, Coach.

494
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,248
That's good, then.

495
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,391
He designed his offense
around one player.

496
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:30,352
We're dead.
 We're not dead.

497
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:33,730
- We just need to start
throwin' the football.
- We're dead.

498
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:35,399
Dead. Pull it.

499
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:43,240
We gotta lighten up. We're 17.

500
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:46,326
Do you feel 17?

501
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,413
I don't feel 17. Pull it.

502
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:52,457
We will win state.

503
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,543
Chavo, you're like a human pinata.

504
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:58,714
You get your ass all beat on
more than anybody I know,
and you just sit there and spit out candy.

505
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,800
That's 'cause he's out of here.
He's got the grades.

506
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:05,304
No matter what, if we win or lose,
he knows he's gettin' out.

507
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:09,224
- He's like the one foot
out the door man.
- It's true, Chavo.

508
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:12,186
 You're gonna be
drinkin'martinis,
Gimme the gun.

509
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,396
eatin'lamb chops,
gettin'manicures.

510
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:18,525
 You're just jealous.
Removin' your freakin' shoes.

511
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:30,996
What's it like being the quarterback?

512
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,582
I mean, this is a big responsibility
for a 17-year-old kid.

513
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:36,502
No.! That is not acceptable.!

514
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:39,546
Uh... It's sort of... I mean, uh...

515
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,967
It's not too bad. I know, uh...

516
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:48,138
- You are playin'like a fool.!
- Do you think
you can handle it?

517
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,308
If you got a receiver
gettin' jammed inside,
what will you do with your brain?

518
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,561
Yeah, I hope so.
What will your brain do?

519
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:56,730
- You'll throw outside!
- Throw it outside.

520
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:58,941
You'll throw outside!
Now you think you can do that?

521
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:01,985
- Yes, sir.
- Well, show me.
Show me!

522
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,287
Hey.

523
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:16,542
Yeah, well, I thought
maybe if you came home
it would help out a little bit.

524
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:20,712
She's sick.
She's not doin' so good.

525
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:26,343
It's just kinda hard.
Football's startin' and this is a lot.

526
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:30,347
Well, I thought if maybe you could
come home, it'd help out a little bit,

527
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,474
'cause she's your mother, too.

528
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:42,401
Okay. Okay.

529
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,404
 Okay.

530
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:57,124
Can you get the job done, Mike?

531
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:05,591
We're pretty small.
I didn't ask you
if you think we're small.

532
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:10,429
I asked you if you think
we can get the job done.

533
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:16,143
Think so.
Well, you're gonna have to do better
than "I think so."Is that clear?

534
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,564
It's clear.

535
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:25,194
Now I'm gonna assume
that by now you've learned
that the world's not fair...

536
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:27,779
and sometimes
you get the short end.
That's all you get.

537
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:32,075
And if you don't do
something personally to fix it,

538
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:36,288
that's all you're ever gonna get.

539
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:38,582
Yes, sir.

540
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:49,259
Mike.

541
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:58,602
Do you wanna play college ball?
Do you wanna get out of this town?

542
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:03,941
Think so.

543
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:08,028
Well, why aren't you
doin' something about it?

544
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:13,242
My mind's not right.

545
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:29,800
One of these days you're gonna
have to get out of this house.

546
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,177
You're gonna have to leave her.

547
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:36,265
Yes, sir.

548
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:41,019
You gotta accept the fact that
people have to take care of themselves,
and that includes you.

549
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:43,730
You understand that?
Yes, sir.

550
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,360
Okay. The truth is,

551
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:52,739
against some
pretty overwhelming odds,

552
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:56,827
if... if you do decide to accept that...

553
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,997
Look at me, Mike.

554
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,376
If you decide to accept that,

555
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,798
you're gonna seriously fly, son.

556
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:25,731
 Same song, different
verse. Middle of the second quarter,
Cooper has a 14-nothing lead.

557
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:28,483
Things are really going south
in a hurry.

558
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:34,323
But when you got an offense play
built around one player, that's great,
as long as the player's there.

559
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:37,117
When he gets hurt,
in this case like Boobie Miles did,
what do you do?

560
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:40,579
I don't know, but Gaines
better come up with a plan quick...

561
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:42,664
'cause the unthinkable's
gonna happen.

562
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:45,209
The Panthers are gonna lose
two consecutive district games.

563
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,962
Wilson gets the hand-off and he's
got room to run on the left-hand side.

564
00:43:49,046 --> 00:43:52,508
Across the line. Clotheslined.!

565
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:55,886
- And he's down.!
- Gimme a running back!
We got a running back?

566
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:58,138
Permian has lost Boobie Miles,
now Wilson,

567
00:43:58,222 --> 00:44:00,224
Comer! Comer!
Yeah, come on!

568
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:03,435
leaving him with third-string
running back Chris Comer.

569
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,980
- Hut!
- Comer around the right side,

570
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:09,316
has some room to run and...
runs out of bounds.

571
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:11,860
- What is that?

572
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:15,197
- I didn't have a block.
- You are so dumb! Are you scared?

573
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,407
I didn't have no block.
Football is a contact sport!

574
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:20,577
I think he's a sophomore.
May be lookin'for
a badminton scholarship or something.

575
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,663
That's not gonna cut it.

576
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:26,542
- Blue 40.! Hut.!

577
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:29,461
The snap. Lookin'to throw.
Here comes the rush.

578
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:34,842
Winchell avoids the rush,
throws the ball,
Comer turns from blocker to receiver.

579
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:39,012
Has the ball, crosses the 20-yard line,
crosses the 30.

580
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:42,099
Comer to the 40.! Comer to the 50.!

581
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,561
- Where did this speed come from?
- Go, go, go!

582
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:48,313
- Who was that?
- It was Comer.

583
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:51,525
- Our Comer?
- It was Comer. It was Comer!

584
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:55,445
Comer has a Mojo touchdown.!

585
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:58,740
Chris Comer with his first varsity T.D.

586
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:00,868
Not letting go of that ball.
Gimme the ball.

587
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:05,330
- 85 yards, the second-longest
power play in Permian history.
- Gimme the ball. Gimme the ball!

588
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:07,916
Interception, Brian Chavez.!

589
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:13,338
Abilene Cooper back to punt.
It's blocked.!

590
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:16,133
Touchdown, Permian.!

591
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:19,386
- That's a Mojo touchdown.
- Jesus!

592
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,681
- Billingsley up the middle,
picks up a great block from Comer.
- Run, Donnie!

593
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:27,269
Forearm shove behind him,
in for the Mojo touchdown.

594
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:29,980
There's your old school football.

595
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:34,234
"Oh yeah"

596
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,988
"Got my Mojo working, baby"

597
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,615
Where did this guy come from?

598
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:44,328
Chris Comer afforded
a couple of fantastic runs
and one fantastic pass reception,

599
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:46,413
leading Mojo from a 14-nothing deficit.

600
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:51,335
Hello?

601
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:55,005
I'm feelin'great. How are you?
I feel much better than I did
before the hit.

602
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:58,342
This team has a swagger. They're
walkin'tall. They're playin'tough.

603
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:00,761
 I love these kids.
I love the way Winchell's playin'.

604
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:03,597
 Real good. They came
together after Boobie went out...

605
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,226
He's got him.
Touchdown in the corner.!

606
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:09,144
You know,
we just have to dig deep...

607
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:11,730
Comer's amazing. You know,
he's stepping in just nicely.

608
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:15,776
My concern is that he doesn't
have the experience in the long run.

609
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:18,820
If they can just stay strong,
not get overconfident,

610
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:21,114
and take out Midland Lee
I think we're goin', man.

611
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:24,159
I think we're gonna go all the way,
but I'm a little worried.

612
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:26,787
Oh no, sir.
It's just a small sprain.

613
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:31,708
It was just, uh, a precaution.
We're on a roll.

614
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,295
 Don't get started
on the celebration dance.
We got Midland comin'up.

615
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:37,172
Midland Lee is the real deal.

616
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:40,425
You don't need to be slackin'right now.
You gotta be playin'and practicin'.

617
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:44,263
Permian zips past
North Shore Galena 17-3.

618
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:47,724
Come on. We're five and one.
The team is winning now.

619
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:50,811
They all win, but who we playin'?
Come on. Mediocre teams.

620
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:57,067
Two losses could shut the door
on the Permian Panthers.

621
00:46:57,109 --> 00:47:00,320
Let's not start tootin'the horns
just yet, you know what I mean?

622
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:05,450
You lose two division games
in this football climate,
and you're done, Sammy. You're done.

623
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,585
Midland.
Boobie.

624
00:47:15,794 --> 00:47:18,797
This the best damn hospital
in Texas.

625
00:47:19,965 --> 00:47:22,092
The very best.

626
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:55,000
My son, Andrew, played for Midland,
and ended up back East at Penn.

627
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,753
Oh, he playin' with,
uh, Joe Paterno.

628
00:47:57,836 --> 00:47:59,963
University of Pennsylvania.
Uh, premed.

629
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:03,467
Oh.
Just let it relax.
You have any pain?

630
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,802
Not at all.
Does this hurt?

631
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:08,096
Nope.
None of that hurts?

632
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,433
Nope.
Okay. Go ahead and sit up and
just let your legs hang over the side.

633
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:14,603
I n fact, why don't you
go ahead and get dressed
and let me look at the scan.

634
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:17,648
l-I'm sorry.
You're James' dad?

635
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:21,318
No, I'm his uncle.
Come over and let me...
let me look at the scan with you.

636
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,363
Uh, this is the scan
we just did today of his knee...

637
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:26,657
and this is looking right
through the middle of the knee.

638
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,702
What we're looking at
right through here is... is the A.C.L.,

639
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:35,624
and what this shows is that
he's had a fairly significant,
fairly serious injury.

640
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:38,168
James, let me show you.
Right through here
is where the injury is,

641
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:41,713
and it looks like you've had
a pretty serious injury
to that part of your knee.

642
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:46,260
Significant enough that...
that I have concerns about
what you can do from here on.

643
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:48,345
So when can I suit up?

644
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:55,644
Well, let me just say with how
your knee felt when I examined it
and what I see on the scan...

645
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:58,772
With... with the...
the things that you do well...

646
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:01,650
The reason that you're great
is that you can run and cut
and hammer people...

647
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:04,486
and you don't hesitate
because you've got a solid knee.

648
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,407
When you don't have this ligament,
you can't do that,
so it's really out of the question.

649
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,535
What? No, no, no. That's...
That's not what Dr. Spencer said.

650
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:14,329
He said three weeks.
Three weeks is up,
and I'm ready to play.

651
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,999
I understand. I understand,
but again, when l...

652
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:20,586
Based on what I see
when I feel your knee, examine
your knee... What I see here...

653
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:23,589
You... You really can't play
with this kind of knee.

654
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,425
What are you talkin'
about, I can't play?
I'm gonna play.

655
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:29,803
I'm ready to play.
My team needs me.
I'm ready to play.

656
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:31,889
Listen to me.
I am listenin' to you.

657
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,016
l-I want...
I want what's best for you.

658
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:37,060
You and I
are on the same page...
We ain't on the same page.!

659
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,229
How you gonna want
what's best for me?
Hold on. Hold on.

660
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:42,357
How you gonna want
what's best for me?
You from Midland, right?

661
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:46,278
You from Midland? Huh?
This is bull, man.

662
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,530
You just jealous
'cause you from Midland.

663
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:51,950
What I recommend...
You jealous 'cause you from Midland.
Who paying you?

664
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,994
- Who paying you?
- Come on, Boobie. That's okay.

665
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:56,622
You tryin' to take
my football career!

666
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:59,625
You tryin'to take
my football career.!
Boobie, let's get out of here.

667
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:03,170
Tryin'to take my football career.!
Whatever you're sayin' to me,
listen to me.

668
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,255
Come on!
Pig!

669
00:50:05,464 --> 00:50:09,426
Here back on Mojo Radio,
it's Slammin'Sammy Stands.

670
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,721
I knew tonight's game was gonna
be a big game, but it just got bigger.

671
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:17,351
Earlier today, Cooper beat Woodland,
which means that if Permian wins tonight,
they're in the play-offs.

672
00:50:17,434 --> 00:50:21,355
If they lose, though, they fall back
into a three-way tie for first place,

673
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:24,942
and that means the tie-breaker
is a coin toss.

674
00:50:26,276 --> 00:50:28,654
So what'd the doctor say?

675
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:37,621
'Cause, see, if you go out there
before your knee's ready...
Coach, my knee's fine.

676
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:44,336
You okay with this, L.V.?

677
00:50:45,337 --> 00:50:47,923
Yeah, I'm good with it.
Hundred percent.

678
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:53,136
Go get dressed.

679
00:51:01,478 --> 00:51:03,981
The most storied rivalry
in the state of Texas...

680
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:08,402
is Permian hosting
the Midland Lee Rebels
at Ratliff Stadium.

681
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:12,489
Tonight one of these teams
could take a step toward the play-offs.

682
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:16,702
Permian has one district loss,
both Cooper and Midland Lee have two.

683
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:18,829
There's no doubt about that.

684
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:22,165
A win tonight puts
Permian in the play-offs,
no coin flip needed,

685
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:25,294
plus it'll send the Lee Rebels
home for the season.

686
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:29,548
 Well, what
do you know, folks. Look at this
coming out of the locker room.

687
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:31,633
Number 45 has emerged
from the locker room.

688
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:34,344
Boobie doesn't look like
he's limping at all.

689
00:51:34,428 --> 00:51:37,389
He looks good to me.
He looks like he's ready to go.

690
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:41,393
Now the question is, decoy or player?

691
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:43,729
He ain't gonna play.
I don't think so either.

692
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:48,692
 From what I know
about Coach Gary Gaines, nobody
holds his cards closer than Gary does.

693
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:53,197
- Come on, guys. Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
- Hut.!

694
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,743
Winchell pitches to Comer.
Flipped on his head.!

695
00:51:57,784 --> 00:52:01,747
Winchell, pressured by Olivera,
swings a pass out to Billingsley...
Picked off!

696
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:06,919
It's Dominguez.
Dominguez will take it in
from 25 yards away.

697
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:09,087
And Lee brings home points.

698
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:12,216
Hang on to the ball, son!

699
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:15,552
Don't worry about it.
Shake it off. Shake it off.

700
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:20,224
Don't worry about it, Coach.
Let me spin. Let me spin, Coach.

701
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,309
Y'all wanna win, put Boobie in.

702
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:24,394
Set. Hut.! Hut.!

703
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:27,272
- Winchell
will swing it out to Billingsley.
- Come on, Donnie.

704
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:30,275
And the ball is tripped
by Dominguez.

705
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:34,112
- Kevin Lane, and a blatant
body slam by Billingsley.
- Donnie! Donnie!

706
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:37,407
What's up?

707
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,580
My goodness. Son, is there
something wrong with you?
Are you mentally okay?

708
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:49,795
What are you
puttin' your helmet on for?
Take your helmet off, son.

709
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:52,840
You're gonna sit on the bench
for a little while.
You don't need that helmet.

710
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:55,759
Third down, with less than
two minutes to play in the half.

711
00:52:55,801 --> 00:53:00,055
Strandler over the left side,
uncontested. 32 yards down to T.D.

712
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:04,518
 Permian came in
with a four-game win streak
but they haven't been tested all year.

713
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:07,688
Coach Gaines is gonna have to find
a way to get his offense on track...

714
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:10,274
or start feeling his season
slipping through his fingers.

715
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:15,070
- Do you think you're playin'football?
Do you think you're playin'football?

716
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:17,990
Do you think you're playin'football?
You are showing me nothing.!

717
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:22,786
Do you understand me?
Do you think you got it made?

718
00:53:22,828 --> 00:53:25,330
Do you think you got it made?

719
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:28,625
Because if that's what you think,

720
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:32,629
you're gonna find out what
it feels like to sit on your asses...

721
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:35,299
and watch Midland Lee
take your season!

722
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:47,352
No offense tonight for Mojo, and still
no sign ofJames "Boobie"Miles.

723
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:51,523
Y'all wanna win? Put Boobie in.
I'm about to spin.

724
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:55,027
Come on, Coach. Come on, Coach.
Let me get this for you.

725
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:59,823
Under five minutes to play
and Lee still leads 14-7.

726
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:04,661
Weak defense, weak offense
and no Boobie. If you're
Coach Gaines, what do you do?

727
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:07,998
Right now Mike Winchell
can't get this offense going,

728
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:10,375
and the Midland coach
has seen Boobie on the sidelines.

729
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:14,171
If you don't put him in,
he knows you're bluffing.
I'd put him in.

730
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:17,216
All right. Move out!

731
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:33,065
Come on!

732
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:41,073
Boobie! You're in.
Let's go! Let's go!
What you want, yo?

733
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:49,831
Well, we apparently are all
gonna get what we wished for,

734
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:54,086
because here comes Boobie Miles,
and this is certainly
what the fans came to see.

735
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:56,672
That's number 45
back in the Permian backfield.

736
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,258
Back slam, 37 stretch...
 Break!

737
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:03,262
Now Boobie the senior,
Number 45, lining up behind
quarterback Mike Winchell,

738
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:07,391
and offensive line is rarin'to go
with room to run.

739
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:10,227
Three, 12, hut.!

740
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:14,565
Miles going left.
Hesitates just a bit.

741
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:19,528
Get off! Get off!

742
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:28,328
- Let's go with 60-Cheetah.
- 60-Cheetah!

743
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:30,914
- Let's go! Let's go!

744
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:35,085
They're gonna cheat up close
to the line again and see if they're
gonna run Boobie one more time.

745
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:37,629
He will go to the right.
There is a hole.

746
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:41,800
He gets a block.
The Dominguez brothers take him down.
He spins and he's down.

747
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:50,475
Take it easy. Stay down.

748
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,770
Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.
Try to relax.

749
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:56,315
Let me take a look at it.

750
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:02,321
I'm gonna get up on my own.
I can get up on my own.

751
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:06,825
Folks, the utterjoy of watching
Boobie Miles trot back on to the field...

752
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:10,954
has been replaced by the sheer misery
of watching him being carried off of it.

753
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:15,501
We unfortunately may have seen
the last of Boobie Miles
in the black and white of Permian.

754
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:18,462
Let me see.
He's done.

755
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:20,964
We're gonna go jet fire, Coach.
Well, you better go somethin'!

756
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,468
One minute 35 seconds
left to play in this one.

757
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:27,346
Panthers move immediately
to the hurry-up offense.

758
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:31,767
 Boobie
no longer a factor. Comer, following
the tackle, will dig up near midfield.

759
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:35,312
The clock now inside of 1:20.
It'll be second down, Permian.

760
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:39,983
Lee clinging to that seven-point lead
and time becomes a factor.

761
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:42,945
- 60 Cheetah.
- 60 Cheetah! 60 Cheetah! Hut!

762
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:47,866
Again, Winchell to Payne,
beating Preston.

763
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,995
Only 40 seconds left.
Mike Winchell trying to keep
Permian's play-off hopes alive.

764
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,957
- Completes the pass.
- He's got it. He's got it.

765
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,334
Winchell was drilled,
but he seems to be okay.

766
00:56:57,376 --> 00:57:01,338
- Back it off!
- Winchell, past time, he's lookin'.

767
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:05,217
Again, Winchell to Payne.
The clock continues to run.

768
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,219
- 25 seconds left.
- Go, go!

769
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:21,400
Let's go! We got four up!

770
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:23,193
Hold it.! Hut.!

771
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:29,032
Mike Winchell trying to keep
the play-off hopes alive. Complete.!

772
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:34,371
- We gotta go with...

773
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:37,040
This is for the ball game.
The clock is still moving.

774
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:43,046
- Come on, front line!

775
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:49,553
- Mike Winchell will go for the shotgun,
steps back and he drops the ball.!
- Pick it up! Pick it up!

776
00:57:49,636 --> 00:57:53,015
Picks it up, steps into the pocket,
looking for Allen Wyles, he's open.

777
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:55,934
Here's the pass, and it's... too tall.!

778
00:57:55,976 --> 00:57:59,730
Midland Lee wins the ball game.

779
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:47,277
It's all right.
No, man.

780
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:50,030
I'm sorry.
It's all right.

781
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:53,242
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
