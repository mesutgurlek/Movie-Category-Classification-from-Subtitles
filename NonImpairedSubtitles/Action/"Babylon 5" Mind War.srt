1
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:10,806
This is Earth Alliance Squadron
Black Omega to stolen transport.

2
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:13,606
Surrender and prepare
to be boarded.

3
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:17,795
If you attempt escape you will
be fired upon and destroyed.

4
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:21,356
Do you understand?

5
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:25,881
Repeat, surrender or...

6
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:38,398
There's a problem, commander.

7
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:42,004
- You missed a button.
- You're bright and cheerful.

8
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:47,287
Got an offer from Universal Terraform
to survey and I'm seeing them today.

9
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:51,076
That's a big operation.
Sure you want to get involved?

10
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:54,239
I've been around the block.
I can handle myself.

11
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:56,875
- You worry too much.
- You don't enough.

12
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,117
Perfect combination.

13
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:01,836
Gotta hurry. See you at lunch?

14
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:05,602
I'm meeting with the construction
guild. Have to make cuts.

15
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:08,759
- I'm not looking forward to it.
- It'll be fine.

16
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:11,725
It's been quiet,
the place is on schedule.

17
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:14,117
What could go wrong?

18
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:20,961
Confirm, Seven Tango Seven,
you're clear.

19
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:25,439
Affirmative, Babylon Control.

20
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:28,363
I'm looking forward to my visit.

21
00:01:32,407 --> 00:01:35,604
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind...

22
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:38,759
...10 years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

23
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:41,885
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

24
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:44,925
Its goal: To prevent another war
by creating a place...

25
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:49,080
...where humans and aliens
could work out their differences.

26
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:52,159
It's a port of call,
home away from home...

27
00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:56,479
...for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

28
00:01:56,927 --> 00:02:00,886
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons...

29
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:05,723
...of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

30
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,238
It can be a dangerous place.

31
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:11,205
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

32
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:14,962
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

33
00:02:15,127 --> 00:02:17,482
The year is 2258.

34
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:21,037
The name of the place is Babylon 5.

35
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:05,525
I've wondered what
it's like to be a telepath.

36
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:10,522
It's like staying in a hotel room where
you can hear the people next door.

37
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:13,520
You can try and shut it out,
but it's there.

38
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,121
Just don't listen
unless you're invited.

39
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:19,404
Is it difficult to block out
people's thoughts?

40
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,842
Depends on the thoughts.

41
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:25,765
- Destination?
- Blue 14.

42
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:31,763
Casual thoughts are easy to block,
but strong emotions slip through...

43
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:34,395
...whether you want them to or not.

44
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:42,838
Blue 14.

45
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,162
I think I'm in love.

46
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:59,039
Earth transport Spinosa is now
embarking in Dock Area 9.

47
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:03,521
Yes?

48
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:13,117
No, sir. I just never met
a Psi Cop before.

49
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:16,725
Yes, sir. I'll bring you there myself.

50
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:18,400
This way.

51
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,242
Would you tell me more about the target?

52
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:27,205
It's a class-four world, Sigma 957.

53
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,325
Not much atmosphere:
Mostly nitrogen and oxygen.

54
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:35,163
- And their sensor picked up diridium.
- Byproduct of Quantium-40.

55
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:38,717
We need that verified.
If so, we'll send out a probe...

56
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:42,004
...so we're in accord
with the regs on exploitation.

57
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:45,842
We can't afford that unless
we know it's worth the effort.

58
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:49,682
How can it not be?
There's a shortage of Q-40 on Earth.

59
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:54,204
- They're backed up on construction.
- We need absolute confidentiality.

60
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:59,202
I need your word you won't mention this
to anyone, including the commander.

61
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:02,640
- My personal life has nothing to do...
- I know.

62
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:05,037
I was told to ask, so I'm asking.

63
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:07,926
We each have our marching orders,
Ms. Sakai.

64
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:11,278
So do I have your word?

65
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:17,796
- She's telling the truth.
- Well, then, we have a deal.

66
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:22,477
There is one other thing.
The target is in a...

67
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:24,683
...contested sector of space.

68
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:29,204
So we'll need the approval of one
other party before we can proceed.

69
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:41,679
Commander? Some VIPs
here to see you, sir.

70
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:43,803
Send them in.

71
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:51,484
No, it's a fine time...

72
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:58,004
Get out of my head.

73
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,283
You wanna talk to me, talk to me.

74
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,802
My apologies, commander.

75
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:05,765
- It saves considerable time.
- I don't care.

76
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:09,966
I don't like people in my head.
I thought the Psi Corps had rules.

77
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:12,322
There are rules, and there are rules.

78
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:15,843
When telepaths go rogue,
someone has to take them down.

79
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:18,521
Only Psi Cops are qualified
to do that.

80
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:22,919
Since we bear a greater responsibility,
we're afforded latitude...

81
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:26,636
...in the interest of efficiency.
- Yes, I'm sure, Mr...

82
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:30,561
Bester. This is my associate,
Ms. Kelsey.

83
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:34,879
We're looking for a rogue telepath.
We believe he's on this station.

84
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:38,084
We need to meet
with your resident telepath...

85
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:41,956
...and your security and command
personnel. We'll proceed...

86
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:46,405
I won't turn this station upside down
because you're hunting a rogue.

87
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:49,639
Not just a rogue, commander.

88
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:52,844
This is a special and
dangerous individual...

89
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:57,000
...whose presence threatens
the entire Earth Alliance structure.

90
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:03,565
This is our guest room. A vibe shower's
in the back and through there...

91
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:06,844
- Price?
- 500 credits per week...

92
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,805
...based on Earth standard cycles.
- Fine.

93
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:14,166
- If there's anything else you need...
- No. No, thank you.

94
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:29,125
Welcome to Babylon 5.
We are at your disposal...

95
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,962
...with onboard facilities
perfectly suited to human...

96
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:35,595
...and non-human travelers.

97
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:40,557
For your shopping convenience
the Zocalo is...

98
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,321
His name is Jason Ironheart.

99
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:07,159
You know him, Miss Winters.

100
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:10,285
He was my instructor
at the Psi Corps Academy.

101
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:14,235
His job is to work with telepaths
level P-5 through P-10.

102
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:17,843
Jamming, long-range scanning,
that sort of thing.

103
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:20,237
- What's his Psi rating?
- He's a 10.

104
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:22,875
All instructors are rated P-10.

105
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:26,278
- And Psi Cops? What are you rated?
- P-12.

106
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:28,358
Someone has to watch the rest.

107
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:31,276
Yes, but who watches the watchmen?

108
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:37,124
One year ago, Jason Ironheart was
reassigned to Earth Intelligence...

109
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:40,802
...working on a covert operation.
- What kind of operation?

110
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,765
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

111
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:45,360
You don't need to know.

112
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:49,759
Let's say that what's in his brain
would compromise Earth defense...

113
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:53,761
...and lead to the death of many
operatives on other worlds.

114
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:57,556
We think he'll sell that
information to other governments.

115
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,287
Nonsense!
Jason would never do that.

116
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:04,326
Our job is to find him
and bring him back. Alive if possible.

117
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:06,159
Dead if necessary.

118
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:10,161
Have you had any contact with
him since you left the academy?

119
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:12,443
Letters, the last was a year ago.

120
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:15,360
You know we'll have to
scan you to be sure.

121
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:19,764
Is that necessary?
I'm telling you the truth.

122
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,646
Perhaps. Perhaps not.

123
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:27,198
- If she doesn't want to be scanned...
- She's required to submit.

124
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:32,566
If she's seen or heard from him, his
fingerprints will be in her thoughts.

125
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:35,116
The process is not pleasant.

126
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:38,962
You may stay or leave as you choose.

127
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,638
That's enough.

128
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,597
I said that's enough!

129
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,445
She's telling the truth.
She hasn't seen him.

130
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,758
Surprising, given
your prior involvement.

131
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:37,438
If Ironheart hasn't shown yet, he will.
We must be informed at once.

132
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:42,761
Do not attempt any contact with him.
Especially you, Miss Winters.

133
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:46,806
Do not approach him.
Do not speak to him.

134
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,923
Is that clear?

135
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:50,725
Yes.

136
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:54,277
You can go now.

137
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,481
What physical threat
does he represent?

138
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:03,525
That's something else
you don't need to know.

139
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:07,316
Just find him. We'll do the rest.

140
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:23,803
Hello, Talia.
I've been looking for you.

141
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:32,559
Talia. Talia, wait, please!

142
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,839
- I can't see you. The Psi Cops are here.
- I know. Listen, Talia...

143
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:40,237
Why are they after you?

144
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:43,479
- Do you know what they did to me?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

145
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:47,003
That's why I waited until after
they scanned you.

146
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:51,524
But it's okay. We'll be safe
for a while, at least.

147
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,884
I have to talk to you.
I need a place.

148
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:58,324
A place where I can wait,
just for a little while.

149
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:01,001
Why? What's going on, Jason?

150
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,796
All I can say now is that
I can't let them find me.

151
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:08,642
If they do, I'll have to kill them
or they'll kill me.

152
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:13,597
But it's not just us. There are
thousands, millions of lives at stake.

153
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,685
Give me five minutes to explain,
that's all.

154
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:20,999
Then, if you want me to leave,
I will.

155
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:23,599
Please.

156
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:26,841
If you're trying to get
at the commander...

157
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,841
No. Whether you believe it or not,
this is for your safety.

158
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:36,081
Sigma 957 is not a healthy place.
Strange things happen there.

159
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:39,796
There's no sentient life
to threaten anyone.

160
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:44,040
Nonetheless, it is not safe.
I have passed through that sector.

161
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:47,882
- Look elsewhere.
- You want Sigma 957 for yourself.

162
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:51,756
The Narn government can't
exploit a world that far away.

163
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:55,522
But you want to hold on to it anyway,
out of sheer spite.

164
00:12:55,687 --> 00:13:00,078
Considering what you were told
about me, I'm sure you believe that.

165
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:04,160
Despite your long acquaintance
with Sinclair, you're new here.

166
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:09,037
Let me pass on to you the one thing
I've learned about this place.

167
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:14,997
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

168
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:18,318
Not Mollari, not Delenn...

169
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:22,321
...not Sinclair and not me.

170
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:27,481
My warning is sincere.
Ignore it at your own peril.

171
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,323
Ambassador.

172
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:35,045
If I have to, I'll go over you.
I have contacts in the Narn Regime.

173
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:38,005
Then I fear the commander
will miss you...

174
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:42,445
...when you fail to return
from Sigma 957.

175
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:49,517
A year ago, I volunteered
for a Psi Corps experiment.

176
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:53,362
It was an attempt to make
telepaths even stronger.

177
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:57,645
Turn a P-5 into a P-10,
and a P-10 into...

178
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:59,320
Into God knows what.

179
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:01,155
Why?

180
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:06,401
Because in this business, whoever has
the strongest telepath wins.

181
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,876
The military wants to scan the enemy.

182
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:12,005
The enemy wants a telepath
who can block a scan.

183
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:15,637
And we want someone who can
cut through the block.

184
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:20,002
They said it was necessary to help
protect Earth.

185
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:23,877
Anyway, the experiments
went on for months.

186
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:27,437
Genetic manipulation.
Mutated strains of serotonin...

187
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:30,804
...and acetylcholine to increase
neural processing.

188
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:34,755
Five, 10, sometimes 15 injections
a day. The pain was...

189
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:41,163
Then one day, I woke up...

190
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,000
...and I could see everything.

191
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:47,921
It was as if my mind had been
a seed for all those years...

192
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:53,366
...and then it blossomed. I could
cut through a block without trying.

193
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:58,043
All I had to do was to look at them
to see what was inside.

194
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:01,360
And that's when
I discovered the truth.

195
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:08,399
Talia, do you remember the T-K tests
you took just before you graduated?

196
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:11,604
Yes. I used a penny
I've had since I was a girl.

197
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:15,760
I tried for days to make it move
with my thoughts. I couldn't.

198
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:19,442
Only one in every 1000 humans
has telepathic abilities.

199
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:23,282
One in every 10,000 telepaths
has telekinetic abilities...

200
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:26,723
...and half of them
are clinically insane.

201
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:29,640
That was the real purpose
of the experiment.

202
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:34,642
To create a stable telekinetic.
And it worked, Talia.

203
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:38,959
It worked beyond everyone's
wildest dreams.

204
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:43,006
That is why I cannot go back.

205
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:46,398
Even if it means letting them kill me.

206
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,522
Commander, I got a lead
on Ironheart.

207
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,679
I checked the incoming ships
and one was stolen.

208
00:15:56,847 --> 00:16:00,362
- Where's it from?
- Sector 15. That's two jumps away.

209
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:03,121
That's where Ironheart was last seen.

210
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:06,916
If he hasn't booked passage out,
he'll need a place to stay.

211
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:09,885
50 quarters were
rented in the last 24 hours.

212
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:14,199
I want that guy found and out of here
as fast as possible.

213
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:17,837
I don't like Psi Cops nosing around.
They're creepy.

214
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:21,443
The way they look at you
like you're some kind of bug.

215
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,798
Commander.

216
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:29,921
Just 50 quarters to search. Good.

217
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,726
That should help narrow it down.

218
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,642
Anatomically impossible,
Mr. Garibaldi...

219
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:43,164
...but you're welcome to try.
Anytime.

220
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:45,363
Anywhere.

221
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:56,081
- Confirmed, Skydancer. You're clear.
- Please log in sequence.

222
00:16:56,247 --> 00:17:00,240
Primary gate to gates 141, 27 and 15B.

223
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,398
Confirmed. Destination?

224
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,001
Sigma 957.

225
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:20,879
- Open channel to Homeworld.
- Channel open.

226
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:27,236
Ambassador G'Kar requesting
clear channel to Narn Military.

227
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:31,036
I require a Frazi-class heavy fighter
for a mission.

228
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:34,643
Destination Sigma 957.

229
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,002
Make sure it's well-armed.

230
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:44,518
I thought they wanted telekinetics
for big jobs.

231
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:48,396
Heavy construction or defense.
I mean, imagine:

232
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:53,766
A telekinetic shield defending against
weapons, for diplomats or presidents...

233
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:55,758
But they didn't want big.

234
00:17:55,927 --> 00:18:00,603
No, they wanted mental control over
small objects, the smaller the better.

235
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,725
- That doesn't make sense.
- No? Think about it.

236
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:07,482
You want to assassinate someone,
so you get a telekinetic.

237
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:12,801
He reaches into a person's throat
and gently, quietly, with a thought...

238
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,720
...he pinches the carotid artery shut.

239
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:19,084
The blood stops, the brain starves...

240
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:23,445
...the target dies
and then you just let go.

241
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:27,122
Murder without a trace.
No fingerprints or poisons.

242
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:31,166
- Oh, my God.
- But they didn't understand, Talia.

243
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,842
- The power, how far it...
- Jason.

244
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:37,885
- What is it?
- Get out. Please, quickly.

245
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:41,357
I can't control this.

246
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:48,882
Get out!
While you can.

247
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:53,847
What the hell?

248
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,486
Mindquake.

249
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:14,318
- Have you got a fix on the disturbance?
- Level 16, three sections down.

250
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:18,241
Just one problem.
Only way there is to go through that.

251
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,838
- What is it?
- I don't know...

252
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:25,795
...but it has Level 16 surrounded.
We can't get past it.

253
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:30,358
Bester said the threat this guy
posed was on a need-to-know basis.

254
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:33,360
You ask me right now, we need to know.

255
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:54,080
Computer. Projected ETA
at Sigma 957?

256
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:59,526
At maximum safe speed,
project ETA at Sigma 957...

257
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:05,000
...at two hours, five minutes,
30 seconds, Earth Standard Time.

258
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:09,683
All right. Let's get this show
on the road.

259
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:15,200
We had our orders.

260
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:20,043
I don't care if you had a message from
God, complete with stone tablets.

261
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:22,323
You lied.
You withheld information.

262
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,445
Don't you think it might
have helped to know?

263
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,685
- We did what we thought was best.
- You were wrong.

264
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:33,523
And now I've got a half-dozen
wounded on a section of Blue 16.

265
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:37,157
Every corridor and transport tube in
to there is blocked.

266
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,761
I want the truth,
and I want it now.

267
00:20:39,927 --> 00:20:45,638
Mr. Ironheart is no longer what
you or I would consider...

268
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:49,083
...entirely human.
- Then what is he?

269
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,520
We don't know.

270
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:03,083
Be still.

271
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:09,003
Be still.

272
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:14,201
Be still.

273
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:19,886
After the experiment,
he began showing signs of stress:

274
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:24,677
Paranoia, psychoses. One night,
he slipped out of his room...

275
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:27,156
...killed a researcher,
and escaped.

276
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:32,727
Along the way, his telekinetic powers
have grown stronger, more violent.

277
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:35,720
In his enhanced state,
he's valuable.

278
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:38,799
Other governments
might have tried to grab him.

279
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:42,482
We couldn't take that chance.
It was a calculated risk.

280
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:45,605
Good old Psi Corps.
You never cease to amaze me.

281
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:48,600
What do you do in your spare time?

282
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,964
Juggle babies?
There goes another calculated risk.

283
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:56,086
- You're not helping the situation.
- You are the situation.

284
00:21:56,247 --> 00:22:00,559
We've seen how powerful he is.
How did you two plan to stop him?

285
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:06,160
Ironheart was programmed
with a fail-safe code to shut him down.

286
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:09,876
It has to be sent by a telepath
directly into his brain.

287
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:13,357
- He must have defenses.
- We two are strong enough...

288
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:16,360
...to burrow past his defenses
and take him down.

289
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:19,121
But we have to be
in the line of sight.

290
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:21,118
You have two choices:

291
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:24,723
Let us take him down our way,
or you'll have to kill him...

292
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:28,163
...before he blows out this station
and everyone on it.

293
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:57,398
Jason, if you can hear me,
this won't work.

294
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:01,005
I need to talk to you, Jason.

295
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,278
Please.

296
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:32,924
Jason?

297
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:37,004
Jason.

298
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:47,485
I thought that seeing you,
being with you again would be enough.

299
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:53,320
Help me hold it together,
shut out the voices.

300
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:58,845
Just rest for a little while
before the end.

301
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:01,279
Before...

302
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:05,364
I shouldn't have come.
I put you at risk...

303
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:10,555
...everyone. I never meant...
I never wanted...

304
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:13,560
I know. I know.

305
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:17,117
We thought Psi Corps
was run by the government...

306
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:19,198
...but that's changing.

307
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:22,001
They're pulling strings
behind the scene.

308
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:25,603
They're more powerful than
you can begin to imagine.

309
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,839
Telepaths make
the ultimate blackmailers.

310
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:33,520
I see it all. And I see it all.

311
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:37,362
- Jason...
- There is no more Jason.

312
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:40,599
I am something else.

313
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:44,203
I am becoming...

314
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:48,726
- Becoming what?
- Everything.

315
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:02,483
Computer, assume parking orbit
around Sigma 957.

316
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:06,799
- Confirmed.
- Begin preliminary atmospheric survey.

317
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:11,040
Launch environmental probe on my mark.
Mark.

318
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:20,240
Receiving planetary data.
Logging in.

319
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:25,197
Good. "Sigma 957 is not
a healthy place.

320
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:29,918
Strange things happen there."
Right.

321
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:41,683
- Level 16 is not accessible.
- Commander.

322
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:44,281
I need to talk to you.
I've seen Jason.

323
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:46,642
- What? Where?
- It's a long story...

324
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:50,800
...and we don't have much time.
We need to talk privately.

325
00:25:57,167 --> 00:26:00,318
Jason's changing.
His powers are growing...

326
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:04,480
...faster than he anticipated.
It's almost beyond control.

327
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:07,366
He doesn't want to
endanger the station.

328
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:11,759
But what he's becoming leaves
little choice. He wants to see you...

329
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:15,636
...alone and unarmed.
He'll drop his defenses only for you.

330
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:20,198
I know it's asking you to take a
terrible chance, but it's our only one.

331
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,483
All right. Where and when?

332
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:26,959
- Blue 12 in one hour.
- Talia, what's between you and Jason?

333
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:31,166
- Why did he come here?
- To see me.

334
00:26:31,727 --> 00:26:33,763
We were lovers.

335
00:26:34,407 --> 00:26:36,762
He was everything to me.

336
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:40,886
The perfect model of what it meant
to be in the Corps.

337
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:46,125
Do you know what it's like
when telepaths make love, commander?

338
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:51,038
You drop every defense
and it's all mirrors...

339
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:56,725
...reflecting each other's feelings
deeper and deeper...

340
00:26:56,887 --> 00:27:01,677
...until, somewhere along the line...

341
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:05,044
...your souls mix...

342
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:10,645
...and it's a feeling so profound
it makes you hurt.

343
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:20,241
It's the only moment in a telepath's
life when you don't hear the voices.

344
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,639
He came to say goodbye, commander.

345
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:29,282
He came to say goodbye.

346
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:02,643
Computer, identify.
What the hell was that?

347
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,883
Unknown.

348
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:07,681
- Computer...
- Ninety percent power loss.

349
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09,115
Emergency power.

350
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:13,798
Negative emergency power.
Orbit deteriorating.

351
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:20,242
Estimate impact with Sigma 957
in two hours.

352
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:36,484
Computer, open tachyon
channel to Babylon 5.

353
00:28:36,687 --> 00:28:40,726
Insufficient energy reserves
to establish communications.

354
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,806
- Scan for any nearby ships.
- Negative on scan.

355
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:49,637
Adjust orientation. Maybe we can
bounce off the atmosphere.

356
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:52,236
Negative. Insufficient power.

357
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:56,719
Damn it, there's gotta be
something I can do.

358
00:28:56,887 --> 00:29:01,403
- Time to impact?
- 1.3 hours.

359
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,284
We need to speak.

360
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:17,198
The Psi Corps is dedicated
to one thing, commander. Control.

361
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:22,243
Control over telepaths,
the economy, the courts.

362
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:25,439
Over matter, over thought itself.

363
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:28,525
But there is something
even more powerful.

364
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:33,039
Something they didn't even know
existed, until I crossed the line.

365
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:38,321
Not mind over matter,
mind over energy.

366
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:43,766
I was suddenly able to influence
objects that were smaller and smaller.

367
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:47,442
Molecules, atoms, neutrons.

368
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:49,837
I look at you, commander...

369
00:29:50,007 --> 00:29:54,797
...and I see not a man,
but a galaxy of subatomic particles...

370
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:59,518
...which I can pull apart
and rearrange with a casual thought.

371
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:04,243
This is a power we were never
meant to have. We're not ready for it.

372
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:07,325
If Psi Cops take him,
they'll dissect him.

373
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:09,995
Find out what drugs
release this power.

374
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:15,002
Can you imagine what they would do
with it? What anyone would do with it?

375
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:18,995
Which is why they say
you shouldn't leave here alive.

376
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:23,120
Why should I trust you?
I've already had six people hurt.

377
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:28,321
An accident. At each new level,
it takes me a while to adjust.

378
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:32,566
I have to fight every minute
to control the forces in my head.

379
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:36,885
- If I'm distracted...
- What about the researcher you killed?

380
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:42,286
I didn't want to. But he was the only
one who could replicate the process.

381
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:46,275
There must never be any more like me.

382
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:49,285
I mean you no harm, commander.

383
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:54,845
If I did, I could vaporize you
right now with a single thought.

384
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:59,006
Please, you must believe me.

385
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:05,157
Assuming I do,
what is it you want from me?

386
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:10,600
Your help and your trust.
I need to get away from here.

387
00:31:10,807 --> 00:31:15,801
I need time to finish becoming...

388
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,157
...and then I'll be gone.

389
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:20,565
Please.

390
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:27,957
- Sinclair to C & C.
- This is C & C. You all right?

391
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:30,727
- Condition green. Garibaldi?
- I'm here.

392
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:34,636
Have your security team clear
Blue 16 to the docking bay.

393
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:39,204
I don 't want anyone to know
what's going on. Is that clear?

394
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:43,480
- Confirmed, commander. What's up?
- We're coming out.

395
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:47,116
Condition?

396
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:50,996
Hull temperature to 700 degrees
and climbing.

397
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:54,324
Entering atmosphere.

398
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:58,677
Two ships detected.
Now entering local space.

399
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:03,278
What? Where? Put it on the monitor.

400
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:10,964
Emergency. This is Catherine Sakai
of the Earth survey ship Sky...

401
00:32:11,127 --> 00:32:16,963
- Of the Earth ship Skydancer. We know.
- You what? Please identify yourself.

402
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:23,003
Captain Sh'Drog of the Narn Regime.
We were dispatched to assist you.

403
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,765
Dispatched by whom?

404
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:28,642
Ambassador G'Kar, 3rd Circle.
Stand by for grapple.

405
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:34,126
We will link up and escort you
back to Babylon 5. Sh'Drog out.

406
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:45,319
Attention, please.
Will all nonessential personnel...

407
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:51,284
...clear all corridors
in sections Blue 16 through Red 4.

408
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:54,917
- What's going on?
- Just a drill, sir.

409
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:58,164
- You're sure?
- Yes, I'm...

410
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:01,040
Good. Thank you.

411
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:28,725
No, I refuse.
I am not going back with you.

412
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:35,200
- This man is under my protection.
- You don't know what you're doing!

413
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:40,037
Commander, we have to hurry.
There's not much...

414
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:44,925
Fail-safe code.
They're trying to shut him down.

415
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:50,239
Mindquakes. They're distracting him.
He's losing control.

416
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:53,845
Let him go.

417
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:59,126
Do you hear me? Let him go.

418
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:09,166
- I won't go.
- Leave him alone. You don't understand.

419
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,760
I won't go back.

420
00:34:15,327 --> 00:34:19,843
Please, no. Don't make me do this.

421
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:22,637
You cannot harm me.

422
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:27,125
You cannot harm one
who has dreamed a dream like mine.

423
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:36,557
Talia! Look out!

424
00:34:55,647 --> 00:34:57,842
- We'll get a doctor.
- No. No time.

425
00:34:58,047 --> 00:35:03,280
Must get to the ship. Hurry. Hurry.

426
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:12,718
- What's he doing?
- Nothing.

427
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,805
He's not moving.
He's just sitting there.

428
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,876
Picking up energy surge.

429
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:24,079
- How big?
- Off the scale.

430
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:47,606
Talia?

431
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,846
Jason?

432
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:55,122
I have become.

433
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:59,559
In memory of love, I give you a gift.

434
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:03,965
The only gift I have to give.

435
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,637
Goodbye, commander.

436
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:23,642
I will see you again.
In a million years.

437
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:30,443
You realize my superiors
will believe none of this?

438
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,366
Yes, especially since,
in about an hour...

439
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:37,685
...we'll have a small accident
that'll erase the file you just saw.

440
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:41,163
- What do you suggest?
- Something close to the truth.

441
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:45,440
Ironheart's ship escaped,
but exploded before the jump gate.

442
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:48,002
- If I refuse?
- My report will mention...

443
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,277
...how you endangered the station...

444
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:54,480
...and through your interference caused
the death of a Psi Cop.

445
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:57,884
- Not much of a choice.
- Your report will indicate...

446
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:02,160
...that Talia Winters was not
responsible for helping Ironheart.

447
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:06,155
She was under his control
and should not be penalized.

448
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:09,837
- That's a lie.
- Yes, it is. What's your point?

449
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:15,161
There's a transport leaving for Earth
in 20 minutes, Mr. Bester. Be on it.

450
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:28,126
Be seeing you, commander.

451
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:35,315
You telling the senator
what Ironheart said about Psi Corps?

452
00:37:35,527 --> 00:37:38,963
I don't know. I'm not sure
what it would accomplish.

453
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:42,955
He was feverish. Paranoid.
Maybe it's true, maybe it isn't.

454
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:47,479
Without evidence, without Ironheart,
it's his word against the Corps.

455
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:50,724
But I suggest we keep our eyes open
just in case.

456
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:54,966
- Got that right. How's Talia?
- Better. Resting.

457
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:59,445
Good. I wonder what Ironheart meant
when he said he gave her a gift?

458
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:02,878
- Do you think she'd tell me?
- No.

459
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:37,686
Ambassador G'Kar?

460
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:42,318
Ms. Sakai, I'm pleased to see
that you have returned safely.

461
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:46,759
Yes, thanks to you.
Just one question. Why?

462
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:48,605
- Why not?
- It's not an answer.

463
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:53,198
Yes, it is. It's simply not
an answer you like or expect.

464
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:57,605
Narns, humans, Centauri, we all do
what we do for the same reason...

465
00:38:57,807 --> 00:39:01,197
...because it seemed
like a good idea at the time.

466
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:06,197
There was no profit, no advantage in
letting you fall to an untimely death.

467
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:09,558
It would distress the commander
to no good effect.

468
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:13,601
So once again we return to, "Why not?"

469
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:16,162
I told you before you left...

470
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:19,882
...no one here
is entirely what they appear.

471
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:23,204
If I surprised you, all the better.

472
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:26,361
Good day, Ms. Sakai.

473
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:28,364
Ambassador.

474
00:39:29,927 --> 00:39:36,162
While I was out there,
I saw something. What was it?

475
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:40,567
What is this?

476
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,644
- An ant.
- Ant?

477
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:46,163
So much gets shipped from Earth,
it's hard to keep them out.

478
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:49,603
I have just picked it up
on the tip of my glove.

479
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:54,437
If I put it down again
and it asks another ant:

480
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:59,402
"What was that?",
how would it explain?

481
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:04,522
There are things in the universe
billions of years older than our races.

482
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:09,676
They are vast, timeless,
and if they're aware of us at all...

483
00:40:09,887 --> 00:40:12,879
...it is as little more than ants.

484
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:16,596
We have as much chance
of communicating with them...

485
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,201
...as an ant has with us.

486
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:22,080
We know, we've tried.

487
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:27,281
We've learned that we can either stay
out from underfoot or be stepped on.

488
00:40:29,247 --> 00:40:32,444
That's it? That's all you know?

489
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:36,481
Yes. They are a mystery.

490
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,679
And I am both terrified
and reassured...

491
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:43,800
...to know that there are still
wonders in the universe...

492
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:48,080
...that we have not yet
explained everything.

493
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:52,599
Whatever they are, Ms. Sakai,
they walk near Sigma 957.

494
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:56,402
They must walk there alone.

495
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:50,036
