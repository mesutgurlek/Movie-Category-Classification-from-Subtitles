1
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:45,028
Yo, what you wanna do?
Let's go down to 40 Street.

2
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:47,655
I don't feel like goin' there, man.
Let's do somethin' better.
Think of somethin' better.

3
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,858
Come on.
Let's go down to 40...

4
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:52,198
? Lord, I miss you ?

5
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,169
<i>Hey.</i>

6
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:56,568
? I've been hangin' on the phone ?

7
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,073
? I've been sleepin' all alone ?

8
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,131
<i>? I want to kiss you ?</i>

9
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:15,021
Yo, brother.

10
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:19,124
Hey!

11
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:23,686
<i>Got a couple twenties
I can hold, my man?</i>

12
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:25,695
Toss in some plastic while you at it.

13
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:28,493
<i>For the wash and wax.</i>

14
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:33,965
Beat it, punks.

15
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:36,061
Dude think he be MichaelJackson
or somethin', man.

16
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,163
I'm gonna cut you good, sucker.

17
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:44,670
Can it wait?
I'm a little busy right now.

18
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:46,509
Absolutely, man.

19
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:48,946
<i>Hey, nice talkin'to you, boss.</i>

20
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:50,778
Come on!

21
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,343
<i>?Just because I shake and party
and roll my sexy body ?</i>

22
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:48,246
<i>? Don't mean
that I'm tryin'to tease ?</i>

23
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:52,149
<i>? It's called body talk
It's not like the walk ?</i>

24
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,711
<i>? 'Cause this time
you're wearin'bluejeans ?</i>

25
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:59,725
<i>? You rub your left leg slow
and let your body go ?</i>

26
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:02,955
<i>? And do a little sexy scream ?</i>

27
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:07,464
<i>? Ah ?
?Jam this party out
Make your body sweat and shout ?</i>

28
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:11,161
<i>? A visual sex machine ?</i>

29
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:13,635
<i>? You're talkin'body talk ?</i>

30
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:17,503
<i>? Talk body to me
Body talk ?</i>

31
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,910
It's okay.

32
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:38,549
<i>?Jigglettes gonna slam
Your pimp dolls jam ?</i>

33
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:41,822
<i>? Let your body talk to me ?</i>

34
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:46,522
<i>? You're lookin'real fine
You're workin'overtime ?</i>

35
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:49,227
<i>? You're footloose and fancy free ?</i>

36
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,404
<i>? Body talk
Talk body to me ?</i>

37
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:57,269
<i>? Body talk ?</i>

38
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,880
<i>? Say, baby, what's that you're doin'?</i>

39
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:21,955
<i>? Well, it looks like
your body is talkin'to me ?</i>

40
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:25,291
<i>? I'm hearin'somethin'?
? What's that ?</i>

41
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:28,231
<i>? Go on
Get it, girl ?</i>

42
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,565
<i>? Ooh ?</i>

43
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:32,830
<i>? Sexy body ?</i>

44
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:37,671
<i>? Sure looks good to me ?
? Body talk with me ?</i>

45
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:41,233
<i>? Sexy body ?
? Oh, babe ?</i>

46
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:45,077
<i>? Sure looks good to me ?</i>

47
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:50,044
<i>? Come on and shake your body ?</i>

48
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:53,781
<i>? I want to hear your body ?
? Your body ?</i>

49
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:57,621
<i>? So come on and shake your body ?
? Your body ?</i>

50
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,491
<i>? I want to hear your body ?
? Your body ?</i>

51
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:37,958
5,000 street corners
in Greater Miami,

52
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:40,085
and Gumby here
has gotta pick ours.

53
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,131
So, you think he's gonna show?
He better.

54
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:52,933
I was up till 5:00 this mornin' trading
shots of tequila with the little bozo
just to close the deal.

55
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:55,496
It'd be well worth it
if he leads us to this Colombian.

56
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,642
So, anyway,
you lost your temper, right?

57
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:07,309
You did the hot-blooded
Latin machismo number,

58
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:10,784
- and you stomped
out of the house, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Something like that.

59
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:16,656
She's due in five months, Sonny.
I don't want her working
in some greasy spoon.

60
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:20,660
Maria knows how tough it is
to raise a family on the kind of bread
cops make.

61
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,390
Hell, Eddie, a baby carriage alone
will put you back
a week's take-home.

62
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:26,491
<i>No wife of mine ought to
have to work for a living.</i>

63
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,268
That's dumb, right?

64
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:38,001
Hey, shortstop.
You wanna crank down
the decibels a notch?

65
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,942
You got a dime?
I wanna give her a call.
Now you're talkin'.

66
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,413
I just wanna let her know
how much I appreciate the effort.

67
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:47,142
Maybe take her out on the town tonight
for a little, uh, romance.

68
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:52,915
What it is? My man!

69
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:55,513
Showtime, Eddie.
Corky's here.

70
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:57,616
You can call her later.

71
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:01,453
Where did I fly in from this time?

72
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:05,995
<i>Malibu.!
Too much, my man.!</i>

73
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:09,194
I mean, the whole geocultural
concept of it all, man.

74
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:12,135
I mean, farmers, man...
Farmers in Bogota.

75
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:14,502
Bogota to Miami to L.A.

76
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:18,976
I mean, all that money, man.
Sometimes I feel guilty, man.

77
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:23,244
<i>You should send
some money there, man.</i>

78
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:26,407
You should send some money
to sponsor a child
or a farmer, man.

79
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:28,782
I did.

80
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,110
Hey, Corky. You forget
where the ocean is?

81
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:35,055
<i>My boat's in the Atlantic.
We're not gonna need
your boat, dude.</i>

82
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:38,388
<i>Different stash,
and it's already in, so...</i>

83
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,724
Uh-uh. That ain't the plan.
Remember?

84
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:44,197
Eddie here flashes the cash,
and we take my boat
and pick up the Colombian's stash.

85
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:48,826
<i>Hey, what Colombian?
Forget him, man.
I got a whole new supplier.</i>

86
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:53,805
Free enterprise, dude, is the basis
of Western democracy.

87
00:10:57,377 --> 00:11:01,436
Okay, boy scout,
you wanna change the game plan?
I'll change the rules.

88
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:04,105
It's now 32 grand a key, not 40.

89
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:07,947
Half the bread now,
the rest contingent upon
a purity test back at my place.

90
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:12,079
And you pick up Eddie here's expenses...
hotel and airfare. Got it?

91
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:15,681
<i>Hey, I got profit margins
to consider here, guys,
and that's a rip-off.</i>

92
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,693
Free enterprise, dude.
Take it or leave it.

93
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:42,069
Ninety-two percent, lab-tested,
pure Peruvian flake, Eddie.

94
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:45,081
None of that baby-laxed rat poo
they push on the coast.

95
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,083
Root canal quality.

96
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:50,278
Burnett, I left the scale.
Do you mind?

97
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:53,516
Check it out, Eddie.
Twelve grand cash.

98
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,287
I was gonna spring 18
for the presidential,

99
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:59,259
but it just screams dealer.

100
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:01,262
<i>You know what I mean?
It's nice.</i>

101
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,923
<i>We are gonna make it happen,
my man.
We're gonna do it.</i>

102
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:06,193
<i>In Miami.
Right here.</i>

103
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,328
<i>And don't worry. I'm gonna get you
some new clothes.</i>

104
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:14,701
Eddie. No!

105
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,902
<i>Lieutenant?</i>

106
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,971
Yeah, Lieutenant,
it's, uh, C-4 plastics.

107
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:04,071
Bomb Squad says it's C-4 plastics
rigged up to the trunk lock.

108
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:08,312
<i>Six keys of cocaine
went up with the Chev, boss.</i>

109
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:12,080
Those mutts will be up
for the next three weeks.

110
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:16,558
<i>Watchin'late-night TVand, uh,
jackin'up their phone bill, right?</i>

111
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:20,487
You guys have got
a sick sense of humor.

112
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:31,736
- Where's Crockett?
- He's in the patrol car.

113
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:34,295
He's pretty shaken up
about Eddie, Lieutenant.

114
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:42,745
<i>Four days ago, we got a line
on that Corky Fowler kid
that bought it back there.</i>

115
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:44,748
He works for the Colombian.

116
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:48,685
I was the middleman.

117
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:53,515
I told him I had a big buyer
in from L.A.

118
00:13:56,392 --> 00:13:58,326
Eddie.

119
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:04,364
They'd already gotten the word
that I was a legit runner
with a fast boat down at the marina.

120
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:09,232
After Eddie flashed the cash,
me and Corky were supposed
to make the pickup...

121
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:13,135
off a Panamanian shrimper
eight miles off Bal Harbour.

122
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,042
Long way from Bal Harbour.

123
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:24,940
Corky had found a new pipeline
and was gonna cut the Colombian out.

124
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:27,348
He was goin' into business
for himself, he said.

125
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:33,419
So this ghost you've been
chasing for two months...
this Colombian drug king...

126
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,481
what makes you so sure
he was behind this?

127
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:38,083
For God's sake, Lou,
Corky was on his payroll.

128
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:41,028
Then he decided to go it alone.
Who else could it be?

129
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,330
Haven't changed much
from your old football days,
have you, Sonny?

130
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:50,869
Listen, Lou...
No! You listen!

131
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:55,237
I haven't heard word one from you
for a whole stinkin' week.

132
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:58,004
No case reviews, no updates,
no progress reports.
I was under. I was setting up...

133
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,207
And no backups!
The last time I requested a backup,
I nearly got shot to death...

134
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:04,772
by Bluto and Lee Harvey Oswald
over there!

135
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:07,818
And as for progress reports,
I'd just as soon buy radio time.

136
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:09,820
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

137
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:12,753
Are you implying that I've got
a bad cop in my department?

138
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:14,848
All I know is,

139
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:18,157
every time I've gotten
within 20 blocks of this Colombian,

140
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,219
I've had the pavement pulled
right out from under me.

141
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:24,596
By the book.
By the book, Sonny, from here on,

142
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,362
or I swear I'm pulling you
off the street.

143
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,532
<i>Sonny.!</i>

144
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,593
Police officers.

145
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,880
I'm sorry.

146
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,017
Hi.

147
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,385
Heard about Eddie.

148
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:33,447
I'm really sorry, Sonny.

149
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:41,059
You free for a drink later?

150
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:44,394
I wish I could, Sonny, but I can't.
I'm workin'.

151
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:52,434
I'll see ya around.
There's somethin' I gotta do.

152
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:03,505
Here, Rudolfo.
This is for you.

153
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:08,678
<i>Ah. What is this, Maria,
the diet plate? Come on.</i>

154
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:11,278
<i>Rudolfo is what you call
a light eater.</i>

155
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:14,655
<i>As soon as it gets light,
he starts eating.</i>

156
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,657
Maria.

157
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,962
<i>Hi, Sonny.
¿Qué pasa?</i>

158
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:46,683
Oh, God!
Just tell me he's okay. Please.

159
00:17:48,754 --> 00:17:50,688
<i>Oh. Oh.!</i>

160
00:17:50,756 --> 00:17:53,553
Tell me he's okay, please.
Tell me he's okay.

161
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,719
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Maria.

162
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:00,451
It happened about an hour ago.

163
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:04,495
Eddie got killed.
No!

164
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:06,660
No!

165
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:20,673
<i>Ground transportation
to Miami, Miami Beach,</i>

166
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:25,684
<i>Coral Gables, Coconut Grove
departs from the main concourse level.</i>

167
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:38,088
Oh, wait. Kids,
no ice cream on the piano.

168
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:41,154
It's about that time, huh?
Caroline, we're gonna help you
and then go.

169
00:18:41,232 --> 00:18:43,256
It's all right, honey.
Thanks.
Just a little.

170
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:48,061
Something must have came up
last minute, you know?

171
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:50,901
Sure.
You know how it is.

172
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:54,500
- Comes with the territory, Caroline.
- Oh, I know the territory.

173
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,507
Nice of you to make it, Sonny.

174
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:10,714
Hi, Dad!

175
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:14,315
Hi, Son.
How's my boy?

176
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:16,324
And why were you so-so late?

177
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:19,386
I'm sorry, Son.
I didn't mean to be.

178
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:23,198
But look what I found for you
on the front lawn.

179
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,360
Can I open it?
Right now.

180
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,798
Hey, man, what's with you?
You're half in the bag,
for God's sakes.

181
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:41,106
Eddie Rivera got killed today.

182
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:50,185
Wow! A police car!
Gee, thanks, Dad.

183
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,783
<i>- Awesome.
- You're the best, Dad.</i>

184
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:27,677
<i>How's Billy takin'all this?</i>

185
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:30,881
He's six years old, Sonny.
How do you expect him to take it?

186
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:41,154
Caroline? You suppose if I had been
in some other line of work,

187
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:43,994
<i>things would have been different?
Doing what?</i>

188
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:46,002
<i>Dealing real estate?</i>

189
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:49,704
Selling Porsches
for my brother downtown?

190
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:54,139
I've been takin'
an informal survey...

191
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,076
of my unit this week,
marriagewise.

192
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,774
Seems out of 16 Vice cops,
we're barely battin'.250.

193
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:07,248
It's not the job.

194
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:10,517
<i>Oh, sure, it's got a lot to do with it.</i>

195
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:13,582
Seeing you shot that time.

196
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:16,560
<i>And your drinking.</i>

197
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:18,822
I've been doing
a lot of thinking about it.
I've been doing a lot better...

198
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:21,728
In a lot of ways, you and your
Vice cop buddies...
than when I started in plainclothes.

199
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,734
Are just the flip side
of the same coin...
I mean...

200
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:27,635
from these dealers you're always
masquerading around with.

201
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,769
You're all players, Sonny.

202
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:39,541
You get high on the action.

203
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:50,244
I'm just gonna check in
on my boy,

204
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:54,385
and then I'd better be goin'.

205
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,451
<i>You're welcome to spend the night.</i>

206
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:03,396
I'll make up the couch.

207
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:23,682
<i>Sonny?</i>

208
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,954
Sonny?

209
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,730
Yeah, you too, babe.
Catch ya later.

210
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:03,174
Hey, man, look out.

211
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:21,397
Feed your face later, Leon.
We're gonna do a lap
around the block together.

212
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,661
Maybe some other time, Burnett.
I'm a little hungry right now.

213
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,828
If l...
Why put off
what you can do today?

214
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,838
Drive.

215
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:39,147
You must be crazy, man.

216
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:42,672
You get in my car
and you slap barbecue
all over my upholstery.

217
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:45,844
Man, I've killed people for less.

218
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,411
<i>Spare me the tough talk, Leon.</i>

219
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:51,514
<i>You and the Colombian already
made your quota for the month.</i>

220
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:55,220
Car bomb... late yesterday,
59th Street underpass.

221
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:58,297
People get blown away
all the time in this town...

222
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:00,594
tryin' to go into business
for themselves, so lighten up.

223
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:04,897
You also blew away my end
of a $200,000 deal, man.

224
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:08,097
Now, you tell the Colombian
I want to meet with him
about my commission.

225
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:12,767
Hey, damn it.
I've seen the man put together
$20 million deals, Burnett.

226
00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:14,832
I'm not just talkin' once either.

227
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,674
There's no way
the man is gonna meet with you.

228
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:21,444
Unless, of course,
you up your status a bit.

229
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:27,118
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do, Burnett.

230
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,918
I got a new shipment
comin' in tonight.

231
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,584
Our original deal is still open
if you're interested.

232
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:35,150
That's 10 grand
for you and your speedboat.

233
00:24:35,227 --> 00:24:38,093
One hour max...
pickup and delivery.

234
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:41,623
Look, man, I'm real sorry
about your client and all that,

235
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,567
but that bomb wasn't meant
for nobody else but Corky.

236
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:47,297
Then again,
there's always buyers.

237
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,143
<i>? I'm just an average man
with an average life ?</i>

238
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:08,051
<i>? I work from nine to five
Hey, hell, I pay the price ?</i>

239
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:11,852
<i>? All I want is to be left alone
in my average home ?</i>

240
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:15,416
<i>? But why do I always feel
like I'm in the twilight zone ?</i>

241
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:20,591
<i>? And I always feel like
somebody's watchin'me ?</i>

242
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,634
<i>? And I have no privacy ?</i>

243
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:28,330
<i>? Whoa-oh, I always feel like
somebody's watchin'me ?</i>

244
00:25:28,405 --> 00:25:30,896
<i>? Tell me, is itjust a dream ?
Hey, Lou.</i>

245
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:33,339
<i>Hey, Lieutenant.</i>

246
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:35,434
Scotch.
You got it, my man.

247
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:40,510
What do you got for me?

248
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,176
Jamaican... the one dancin' around
on the floor over there.

249
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:47,414
Been here three nights in a row
tryin' to score.

250
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:50,650
<i>? When I'm in the shower
I'm afraid to wash my hair?</i>

251
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:54,750
<i>? 'Cause I might open my eyes
and find someone standing there ?</i>

252
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:57,319
<i>? People say I'm crazy
just a little touched ?</i>

253
00:25:57,397 --> 00:26:01,424
<i>? But maybe showers remind me
of Psycho too much ?</i>

254
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:07,202
Hey, twinkle toes.
Yeah, mon.

255
00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:10,138
We gotta talk.
Cool.

256
00:26:10,207 --> 00:26:15,303
<i>? I always feel like
somebody's watchin'me ?</i>

257
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:18,574
<i>? Who's playin'tricks on me ?</i>

258
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:20,808
<i>Keep up the good work, princess.</i>

259
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:26,814
I love it!

260
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,282
What?

261
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,217
This guy you've been lookin' for.

262
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:40,121
What do you want with him?
His name is Calderone.
You know him?

263
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:44,701
Do you?
He's a friend of a friend.

264
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,135
He used to supply a certain...
merchandise...

265
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:51,198
to a friend who supplied me.

266
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:54,039
Take your bar jive
back to Brooklyn, Rastas.

267
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:57,306
You're outta your league.
Hey, listen, man.

268
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,610
I can handle four times the weight
that my friend could.

269
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:02,981
I got 200 grand
in my "shavin's" kit alone...

270
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:06,487
and unlimited resources
in New York City.

271
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:11,253
Excuse me...
while I catch my breath.

272
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:14,920
Hey, tell him... Teddy Prentiss,
Tooney's friend.

273
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:20,855
I'll be at this number
until tomorrow night at the latest.

274
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:26,192
I'll see what I can do
to accommodate you, Prentiss.

275
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,934
<i>More great rock and roll
comin'your way. Let's check temperatures
around the country first.</i>

276
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:36,308
<i>That cold spell still grips
the Northeast.</i>

277
00:27:52,126 --> 00:27:54,059
Hello.

278
00:27:54,128 --> 00:27:56,062
Speakin'.

279
00:27:57,564 --> 00:27:59,861
Two hours.

280
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:01,866
I'll be there.

281
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:56,786
You wanna
slow it down a little bit.

282
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,389
Slow it down a little bit.
It's just around here.

283
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,441
<i>You got the money?</i>

284
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:56,711
120,000.
You got the party favors?

285
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,770
Got three keys
in the boat.

286
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,284
Hey, look,
I don't know y'all!

287
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:13,622
Who sent you an invitation?
Since when do you need an invite
to your own party?

288
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:20,432
I hope you took the keys
out of that monster.

289
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,128
Come on, Scott.
Who do you think
you're dealin' with here?

290
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:27,696
<i>A guy who's about to lose
a hundred grand worth of speedboat.</i>

291
00:31:29,341 --> 00:31:31,275
Like hell!

292
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:33,675
A little early,
aren't you, airheads?

293
00:32:33,663 --> 00:32:35,686
You beast, you!

294
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:55,276
Freeze! Miami Vice!

295
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,215
Congratulations, pal.

296
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:07,691
New York.

297
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,125
<i>Two weeks.!</i>

298
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,185
Two weeks of legwork
I put in on this bust,

299
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:15,787
and three-fourths of the dealers
turn out to be cops!

300
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,833
Me, Scottie Wheeler
and Dr. Voodoo here...

301
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,097
putting in a surprise guest appearance
direct from Fun City.

302
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:26,231
Crockett...
Not to mention Heckle and Jeckle
jumpin' the gun by a good five minutes.

303
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:29,140
Is that what you mean by team playin'?
What I'm trying to tell you
is there was a foul-up...

304
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:32,643
You know, my badge says "Miami,"
but lately it's been lookin' a lot
like Disney World.

305
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:35,305
Shut up, Crockett!
And I'll explain.

306
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:38,940
Now, Tubbs is here
on priority clearance...

307
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:41,508
per direct request
of the N.Y.P.D.

308
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:46,214
<i>Interagency memo, Crockett.
Confidential.</i>

309
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:48,985
<i>I'd sort oflike to keep it that way,
if you catch my drift.</i>

310
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:51,858
Hey, no offense, but when it comes
to security leaks,

311
00:35:51,929 --> 00:35:54,191
this town of yours
ain't exactly Pentagon South.

312
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:57,830
Interesting perspective.

313
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:00,265
<i>So, uh, tell me now, "Dubbs. '"
Tubbs.</i>

314
00:36:00,335 --> 00:36:03,169
<i>My friends call me Rafael.</i>

315
00:36:03,236 --> 00:36:07,104
Are you down here for some
specific value to the taxpayers,

316
00:36:07,174 --> 00:36:10,904
<i>or are you just workin' on your tan?</i>

317
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:14,412
Well, hush my mouth!
He's so funny.

318
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:16,506
You ever hear of a local dealer
named Calderone?

319
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,384
<i>Well, about four weeks ago,
one of our detectives...</i>

320
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:25,150
set himself up in a meet with Calderone
and a New York pusher named Tooney.

321
00:36:25,221 --> 00:36:28,784
The bust went sour.
Our man was shot to death.

322
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,418
But he took Tooney with him,
and Calderone got away.

323
00:36:31,494 --> 00:36:33,792
New York figures
he's back down here.

324
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:36,524
Yeah, alongside
5,000 other bush-league pushers...

325
00:36:36,598 --> 00:36:39,259
with five aliases each
and passports to match.

326
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:42,702
He's a major-league, Crockett.
He killed a cop.

327
00:36:42,771 --> 00:36:45,067
That dude I showed up with tonight
is one of his front men,

328
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:49,268
and I was settin' him up for a rollover
before you and that cavalry
of yours showed up.

329
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:53,641
The guy's in town for three days...
already he's an expert.

330
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:57,273
That "dude" you showed up with tonight
works undercover for the D.E.A., pal.

331
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,647
<i>His name's Scott Wheeler.
And as for Leon,</i>

332
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,381
he's on the payroll of a Colombian
I've been two steps behind
for months now.

333
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:10,085
Surveillance photo...
taken before the shootout.

334
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:15,987
<i>Our man, Tooney.
Dude on the right is Calderone.</i>

335
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:18,055
<i>The Colombian.</i>

336
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:23,536
Who?
Suspect in a half-dozen
drug murders down here.

337
00:37:23,604 --> 00:37:26,369
Moves a lot of weight.
Yeah?

338
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,171
Well, looks like you two
are after the same man.

339
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:32,234
Look, instead of beatin' up
on each other,

340
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:34,473
why don't you guys
consider workin' together?

341
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,943
<i>Forget it.
Night, Lou.</i>

342
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,379
I want a copy of that
first thing tomorrow.

343
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:04,596
Hey.
Yeah.

344
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:22,117
Ensign Tubbs
reportin' for duty, sir!
Oh!

345
00:38:22,188 --> 00:38:24,781
Damn it.

346
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:29,592
Hey, Crockett.
It's a great day to be alive, man.

347
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,719
Yeah, or beat someone to death,
dependin' on your disposition.

348
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:37,696
What are you doin' here?
Here.

349
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:42,227
Photocopies of your good friend
Calderone. Remember?

350
00:38:42,304 --> 00:38:44,133
Have some coffee and doughnuts.

351
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:49,271
Rodriguez told me
I'd find you here...
under the name of Burnett.

352
00:38:49,343 --> 00:38:54,211
<i>- Is that your cover or somethin'?
- That's the general idea, Tubbs.</i>

353
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,945
As far as the locals are concerned,
I'm just another hard-partyin'
ocean guy with questionable means.

354
00:38:59,018 --> 00:39:03,317
With a hundred thousand dollar
cigarette boat and a sideline
of recreational stimulants.

355
00:39:05,257 --> 00:39:08,919
This cop that bought it up in New York...
friend of yours?

356
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:12,622
Yeah. We knew each other.
Hey, listen, Crockett.

357
00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:15,665
I've been thinkin' about what
Rodriguez said last night...

358
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:18,700
<i>about us workin' together
on this thing, and I think...
Save your breath, Tubbs.</i>

359
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:21,529
I got enough problems
with this investigation already...

360
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:24,597
without playin' tour guide
to some wide-eyed understudy...

361
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:27,334
down here on a weekend pass.

362
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,342
Wait a second!
No, you wait a second.

363
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,572
You might have commendations
up the ying-yang
in the Bronx or New York...

364
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:34,978
or wherever the hell it is
you're from,

365
00:39:35,048 --> 00:39:39,039
but this is Miami, pal,
where you can't even
tell the players without a program.

366
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:41,915
Down here,
you're just another amateur.

367
00:39:41,987 --> 00:39:45,013
And what are you,
God's gift to law enforcement?

368
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,024
From what I hear...
a suspension and misconducts...

369
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:49,287
and car bombs aside...
you're not the safest...

370
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:56,856
I guess I asked
for that one, huh?

371
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:59,128
No. No, you didn't, man.

372
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:02,693
That was totally outta line.

373
00:40:02,772 --> 00:40:05,137
- You mean that?
- Absolutely.

374
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:14,673
I couldn't let you handle
all that bad karma by yourself.

375
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,345
You wouldn't happen to have any ice
on this bucket, would you?

376
00:40:22,288 --> 00:40:25,723
Yeah. Down below.
Help yourself.

377
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:40,034
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

378
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:42,899
<i>Hey, hey.! Hey.!</i>

379
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:45,599
<i>Uh, Crockett.! Hey.!</i>

380
00:40:47,642 --> 00:40:51,235
<i>Officer Tubbs, say hi to Elvis.</i>

381
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:54,076
<i>Former mascot
of the University of Florida
football Gators.</i>

382
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:58,914
<i>Currently, he's a watchdog
and resident dope-sniffer
of the St. Vitus Dance.</i>

383
00:40:58,986 --> 00:41:03,546
<i>He got benched his senior year
for takin'a little chomp out of
a Georgia free safety.</i>

384
00:41:03,622 --> 00:41:05,557
Hey, hey! Uh...
Hey, hey! Call him off, man.

385
00:41:05,623 --> 00:41:07,558
I don't even like alligator shoes.

386
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:09,753
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't talk like that, man.

387
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:11,852
You're gonna
hurt this feelings.

388
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:14,762
Don't mind him, Elvis.
He's from New York.

389
00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:18,732
<i>Yeah.</i>

390
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:21,429
<i>He's ticking.</i>

391
00:41:21,504 --> 00:41:26,736
Alarm clock. Some frat punks
pulled a Captain Hook on him.

392
00:41:26,808 --> 00:41:32,145
<i>And he ate a flight bag full of L.S.D.
On a Key West lab bust last Thursday.</i>

393
00:41:32,214 --> 00:41:34,875
<i>Been a little freaked out
ever since.</i>

394
00:41:34,948 --> 00:41:37,940
But all in all, I feel he's
in a much better environment.

395
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:41,474
Takes a licking
and keeps on ticking, huh? Whoa.

396
00:41:41,554 --> 00:41:46,252
Gotta move.
Got a bail hearing downtown
on last night's bust.

397
00:41:46,324 --> 00:41:49,521
<i>Leon's long-awaited debut
as a lead vocalist.</i>

398
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:51,528
<i>Hey, dream on, Crockett.</i>

399
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:55,326
<i>Leon ain't gonna roll over
on Calderone.
Wanna bet?</i>

400
00:41:56,534 --> 00:42:01,595
Do me a favor, will ya?
Feed ol' Elvis his breakfast for me.

401
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:03,104
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

402
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:06,163
Hey! Crockett!

403
00:42:07,977 --> 00:42:11,342
Hey. Nice alligator.
Crockett!

404
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:24,856
<i>I'll give you seven points
if you take the Dolphins.</i>

405
00:42:24,924 --> 00:42:27,823
For an even hundred.

406
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:31,657
<i>Leon Mohammed Jefferson,
please approach the bench.</i>

407
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:37,530
<i>In accordance with prior recommendation
of the state attorney's office...</i>

408
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:40,364
<i>I'm gonna have to open
a trust fund in your name.</i>

409
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:46,103
<i>One move,
and you're history, buster.</i>

410
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:55,611
<i>A little overload problem
on account of the heat,
Your Honor.</i>

411
00:42:55,683 --> 00:42:58,209
Maintenance
is workin' on it.

412
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:02,550
Not exactly a high watermark
for our physical plant,

413
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,454
<i>but nevertheless
a glowin'testament...</i>

414
00:43:05,524 --> 00:43:08,048
to our constitutional right
to bear arms.

415
00:43:11,064 --> 00:43:15,226
Martha.

416
00:43:18,034 --> 00:43:20,594
Martha?

417
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,868
Put the gun away now.

418
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:27,466
<i>Now, Mr. Jefferson,</i>

419
00:43:27,543 --> 00:43:30,273
as per recommendation
of the state attorney's office...

420
00:43:30,345 --> 00:43:34,008
and in consideration of your
investigative cooperation
with that office...

421
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:37,642
What is he talkin' about...
cooperation?
I don't know what he's talking about.

422
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:39,688
<i>...and release you on your own recognizance.
- I didn't cooperate with no state attorney.!</i>

423
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:42,745
- Let me take care of this.
- This man's gonna get me killed
talkin' this stuff!

424
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:45,484
<i>Whose side are you on anyway?
Just get outta my face.!</i>

425
00:43:45,558 --> 00:43:47,492
<i>I advise you to accept
your blessings, Mr. Jefferson.</i>

426
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:50,051
Your Honor, I didn't cooperate
with no state attorney!
I didn't roll over on nobody!

427
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,893
<i>- I say put a lid on it!
- Are you listenin'?
You're not listenin'to me.!</i>

428
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,865
<i>I said put a lid on it, sir...
Get your stinkin', filthy hands
off of me!</i>

429
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,993
<i>Or I will personally hold you
in contempt of this court.!
I need help!</i>

430
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:01,231
<i>You're not listenin' to me!
You're not listenin'!
Next case.</i>

431
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:04,240
I didn't roll over on nobody!
You hear me?

432
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:06,399
<i>You know anything
about this?</i>

433
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:08,410
<i>Sonny T. Burnett.</i>

434
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,181
Give me a light.

435
00:44:56,251 --> 00:44:59,151
And quit lookin' so sure of yourself.
There's no guarantees here.

436
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:03,552
Are you kiddin'?
They practically needed a tow truck
to get Leon out of that courtroom.

437
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:05,784
Eight-to-five,
he'll be on the horn
within the hour...

438
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:08,155
screamin' for protective custody
and beggin' to roll.

439
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:11,196
Hey, Avery just filled me in
on the ride over here.

440
00:45:11,263 --> 00:45:13,924
Very slick, guys.
Very slick.

441
00:45:13,998 --> 00:45:17,526
So, how do you like workin'
with the feds, Scottie?

442
00:45:17,601 --> 00:45:20,627
No complaints so far.
Uh-huh. Yeah, sure.

443
00:45:20,703 --> 00:45:24,662
But I have to admit
I do miss the old days.

444
00:45:24,741 --> 00:45:26,675
We made one hell
of a team.

445
00:45:26,742 --> 00:45:29,234
Get outta here.
I carried you the whole way.

446
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:31,643
<i>Oh, oh. Smart aleck.
Uh, Line 21, Lieutenant.</i>

447
00:45:31,713 --> 00:45:34,579
He wouldn't give his name though.

448
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:43,580
Rodriguez.

449
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:47,486
Yeah, right. Well, uh, I know
all about that, Leon.

450
00:45:48,828 --> 00:45:52,592
Mm-hmm. Well, I, uh, suppose
that depends on you.

451
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:57,467
All right.

452
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:01,097
All right.

453
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:04,732
Tell you what. You hold tight there,
and I'll call you back in 10 minutes
and let you know.

454
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:11,373
Pick him up, Crockett.
He's ready to roll.

455
00:46:14,382 --> 00:46:19,318
<i>? Oh, girls just wanna have fun ?</i>

456
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:28,354
<i>? The phone rings
in the middle of the night ?</i>

457
00:46:28,427 --> 00:46:33,626
<i>? My father yells
What you gonna do with your life ?</i>

458
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:36,691
<i>? Oh, Daddy dear
you know you're still number one ?</i>

459
00:46:36,768 --> 00:46:39,463
<i>? But girls, they wanna have fun ?</i>

460
00:46:39,537 --> 00:46:43,370
<i>? Oh, girls just wanna have fun ?</i>

461
00:46:43,439 --> 00:46:47,070
<i>? That's all they really want ?</i>

462
00:46:47,144 --> 00:46:51,044
<i>? Some fun ?</i>

463
00:46:51,113 --> 00:46:54,310
<i>? When the workin'day is done ?</i>

464
00:46:54,382 --> 00:46:58,342
<i>? Oh, girls, they wanna have fun ?</i>

465
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,218
<i>? Oh, girls just wanna have fun ?</i>

466
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,058
<i>Look out.</i>

467
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,333
<i>? Some boys take a beautiful girl ?</i>

468
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:33,074
<i>? And hide her away
from the rest of the world ?</i>

469
00:47:33,148 --> 00:47:36,413
<i>? I want to be the one
to walk in the sun ?</i>

470
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:40,716
<i>? And girls, they wanna have fun ?</i>

471
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:43,449
<i>You're startin' to get
on my nerves, New York.</i>

472
00:47:43,522 --> 00:47:46,549
So, I tailed him down here
from the courthouse.

473
00:47:46,627 --> 00:47:50,652
How'd you know he was here?
It's called protective custody, son.

474
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:54,096
<i>I'll explain it to you sometime.
? When the workin'day is done ?</i>

475
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:58,158
<i>? Oh, girls, they wanna have fun ?</i>

476
00:47:58,236 --> 00:48:02,536
<i>? Oh, girls just wanna have fun ?</i>

477
00:48:02,606 --> 00:48:04,972
<i>Surprise, Leon.
I mean, you...</i>

478
00:48:09,545 --> 00:48:12,105
Hey.

479
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:15,117
Back off, people.
Police.

480
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,982
He's dead.

481
00:48:18,053 --> 00:48:20,452
<i>Is he dead?
You.</i>

482
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,752
<i>I want the film from that camera
and every camera within 50 yards ofhere.</i>

483
00:48:23,824 --> 00:48:25,792
Do it now.

484
00:48:35,535 --> 00:48:37,468
<i>What happened?</i>

485
00:48:49,813 --> 00:48:53,840
Hey, Crockett.
Hey, man.

486
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:57,407
You know, you and me
been bumping knees and elbows
ever since we first met.

487
00:48:57,486 --> 00:49:00,545
I think it's time
you reconsider my offer, pal.

488
00:49:02,255 --> 00:49:04,691
Hey, man, why don't you
get off of yourself?

489
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,750
You know this investigation
is dead in the water
without me, man.

490
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:10,729
What are you talking about?
That bust last night.

491
00:49:10,797 --> 00:49:15,598
As far as Calderone's people
are concerned, I made off with both
the party favors and the cash.

492
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:17,760
I'm gonna be hearing from 'em.

493
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:26,869
You need me, Crockett.

494
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:40,683
Well, I don't know
how this is gonna work, Tubbs.

495
00:49:40,757 --> 00:49:45,419
I mean, uh, you're not
exactly up my alley...
style and personawise.

496
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:49,450
Heaven knows
I'm no box of candy.

497
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,361
But all things considered,

498
00:49:52,431 --> 00:49:57,666
I think we might have to consider
some sort of temporary...

499
00:49:57,736 --> 00:49:59,670
working relationship.

500
00:50:03,574 --> 00:50:05,872
<i>Shouldn't I be asking you
for a search warrant or something?</i>

501
00:50:05,943 --> 00:50:08,536
<i>Got it right here. "Hereby granting
a warranted inspection...</i>

502
00:50:08,613 --> 00:50:10,807
<i>"of one Leon Mohammed
Jefferson's premises...</i>

503
00:50:10,881 --> 00:50:13,246
Charmaine!
This 20th day of, uh..."

504
00:50:13,316 --> 00:50:17,809
Charmaine,
answer the phone, will ya?

505
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:20,218
Here. Drop it in the mail slot
when you're through.

506
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:27,318
Hey, man, this is a two-year warranty
on a set of steel-belted radials.

507
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:29,453
No.

508
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:45,838
<i>Oh, man. Damn.!</i>

509
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,708
<i>Let's give it
a quick once-over anyway.</i>

510
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,804
Maybe they forgot something.

511
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,849
<i>You enjoy beating
a dead horse, Tubbs?</i>

512
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:57,319
In football, we call this
a fourth down passing situation.

513
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,320
Yeah.

514
00:51:00,622 --> 00:51:04,058
Crockett.
James "Sonny" Crockett.

515
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:09,059
Very good, Tubbs.
Next week we'll work on your name.

516
00:51:09,129 --> 00:51:11,757
<i>University of Florida.</i>

517
00:51:11,832 --> 00:51:15,665
All-American wide receiver
number 88. Am I right or what?

518
00:51:15,735 --> 00:51:18,669
<i>Oh, that was a long time ago.
You were sensational.</i>

519
00:51:18,738 --> 00:51:22,196
<i>I remember one time
I watched you run
a screen pass 90 yards...</i>

520
00:51:22,273 --> 00:51:26,073
with 10 seconds left on the clock, man,
for the winning T.D. Against Alabama.

521
00:51:26,144 --> 00:51:29,111
Funky honky.

522
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,638
Ahh! It was 92 yards, Tubbs.
Six seconds remaining.

523
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:36,207
Yeah, well,
excuse the hell outta me.

524
00:51:36,286 --> 00:51:41,153
You know, not that Vice isn't
the most glamorous gig in the world,
Crockett, but what happened, huh?

525
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:44,784
I mean, you must have
had half the scouts
in the NFL on your tail.

526
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:48,226
Traded it all in on two years
in the Southeast Asian Conference.

527
00:51:48,296 --> 00:51:51,196
<i>'Nam?
No, Coney Island.</i>

528
00:51:53,534 --> 00:51:56,196
Hey, what have we here?
It's a phone book.

529
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:58,203
<i>No names, only numbers.</i>

530
00:52:00,106 --> 00:52:03,801
I'll have Ma Bell
do a back-trace.

531
00:52:03,876 --> 00:52:06,605
You know, Leon was real panicked
outside that courthouse, Crockett.

532
00:52:06,676 --> 00:52:09,167
He must have changed cabs
three or four different times.

533
00:52:09,246 --> 00:52:12,375
I know for a fact
the only tail on him was mine.

534
00:52:12,449 --> 00:52:14,440
So how'd the hitter
know where to find him, huh?

535
00:52:14,518 --> 00:52:16,452
What are you
trying to say, Tubbs?

536
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,080
I'm saying that the only people
who knew Leon was there
were cops.

537
00:52:21,156 --> 00:52:26,423
You know, buddy, you got
a leak in your department
the size of the East River.

538
00:52:26,494 --> 00:52:29,758
Listen, pal, I'll worry
about my department.

539
00:52:29,831 --> 00:52:33,287
Now, unless you got a secretary
back at your motel, I suggest
you scoot on back there...

540
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:35,731
and wait for the phone to ring.

541
00:52:39,872 --> 00:52:43,307
Lou, I'll see you in a minute.
Uh, Gina.

542
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:45,934
Hi, sweetheart, look.
I need to ask a favor of you.

543
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:48,273
Oh, yeah?
Last time you said that,

544
00:52:48,346 --> 00:52:51,111
I ended up babysitting
a sick crocodile
for an afternoon.

545
00:52:51,183 --> 00:52:53,513
Alligator, darling.
Alligator.

546
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:56,553
Look, I got a couple of rolls of film
I need dropped off at the downtown lab.

547
00:52:56,619 --> 00:52:58,552
Are you gonna be
anywhere near there?

548
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:02,387
Sonny, I gotta be in costume
and on the pavement
in less than an hour.

549
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:06,018
How 'bout dinner tonight?
Token of my appreciation.

550
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:10,327
I'll think about it.

551
00:53:10,398 --> 00:53:12,831
Oh, also, Gina,
uh, could you, uh,

552
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:17,495
gimme a little file computer readout
on a New York narc named Rafael Tubbs?

553
00:53:17,572 --> 00:53:19,766
Since you're gonna
be there anyway.

554
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,773
Give him an inch,
he thinks he's a ruler.

555
00:53:21,841 --> 00:53:23,900
<i>Sonny.</i>

556
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:27,844
Line two.
Crockett.

557
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,607
We're back
in business, my man.

558
00:53:29,681 --> 00:53:32,878
Calderone's right hand
just called about the cash.

559
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:35,316
Name's, uh, Trini DeSoto.

560
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:39,583
A voice a little on the festive side?
A cross between Tito Puente
and Carol Channing?

561
00:53:39,656 --> 00:53:43,352
You got it, man.
Pick you up in 15 minutes.

562
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:54,463
<i>Hey. ¿Qué tal, huh?</i>

563
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:59,632
You see, most of the Marielito riffraff
stuck in detention with me...

564
00:53:59,706 --> 00:54:01,901
<i>killed the time
watching Family Feud,</i>

565
00:54:01,975 --> 00:54:06,435
<i>uh, Hollywood Squares,
In Search of the Ryan's Hope.</i>

566
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:09,810
All that garbage. Huh?
Not me, man.

567
00:54:09,881 --> 00:54:12,678
<i>I figure, dig it, Trini.</i>

568
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:17,186
You could be stuck
in this place six months, man,
waiting for your papers.

569
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,587
Use the time, man.
Improve your mind.

570
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,591
You read
a lot of books, huh?

571
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:27,322
You're missing my point, man.
I skip all that network jive.

572
00:54:27,395 --> 00:54:32,196
<i>I Love Lucy, Father Knows Best,</i>

573
00:54:32,267 --> 00:54:35,258
<i>Leave It To You, Beaver,
Gilligan's Island.</i>

574
00:54:35,335 --> 00:54:37,962
<i>It's where I learn to
speak English so good, man...</i>

575
00:54:38,037 --> 00:54:41,530
The golden age ofTV.

576
00:54:41,606 --> 00:54:44,270
And forget about Desi Arnaz, man.

577
00:54:44,344 --> 00:54:47,005
The fact that dude never got
an Academy Award...

578
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:50,069
says something very deep
about the American psyche.

579
00:54:50,147 --> 00:54:54,050
New York critics, Trini,
don't let it throw you.

580
00:54:54,117 --> 00:54:58,418
Whatever. Anyway,
I bored you enough
with my background, man.

581
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:01,615
Do you got the money?
Not until I see Calderone.

582
00:55:01,691 --> 00:55:05,352
<i>Teddy,
I'm his personal representative.</i>

583
00:55:05,426 --> 00:55:09,420
Look, I didn't have to
show here today.
This is strictly gratis.

584
00:55:09,498 --> 00:55:13,935
After that little fiasco last night,
I'm through dealing with a middleman.

585
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:16,867
You tell Calderone
he wants his cash,

586
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,201
he deals with me,
Teddy Prentiss, personally.

587
00:55:19,271 --> 00:55:22,264
No more intermediaries.

588
00:55:22,342 --> 00:55:24,936
And you, Mr. Burnett,
what's your stake in all this?

589
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:28,309
<i>Burnett's gonna be handling
all the transportation.</i>

590
00:55:31,449 --> 00:55:34,578
Wise choice, Teddy.

591
00:55:34,651 --> 00:55:39,145
Your reputation
as a boating enthusiast
precedes you, my friend.

592
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:43,716
If you mean that slack-jawed Leon,
the word I got is
he's done preceded all of us.

593
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:51,095
<i>Preceded all of us, eh?</i>

594
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:53,099
<i>That's muy bien, huh?</i>

595
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:57,159
9:00. Key Biscayne Club, eh? Hmm?

596
00:55:57,236 --> 00:55:59,229
You bring the money.

597
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,635
The dude gives new meaning
to the word "alien."

598
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,347
<i>Come on, let's blow
this pop stand.</i>

599
00:56:12,517 --> 00:56:15,712
You know, Crockett,
I've been doing some thinking
about that possible leak,

600
00:56:15,786 --> 00:56:19,983
and, uh, well, how well do you know
this Lieutenant Rodriguez?

601
00:56:20,057 --> 00:56:23,288
What are you getting at?
Well, he's the point man
in this whole operation.

602
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,887
Whoa! You're down here
on a courtesy pass, New York,

603
00:56:26,962 --> 00:56:29,726
so take a major conversational
detour right now.

604
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:31,731
<i>Hey, lighten up, man.
Lighten up.
Capisce?</i>

605
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,926
I was just asking.
You were just asking
about a man...

606
00:56:34,003 --> 00:56:37,267
I consider to be one of
the most righteous cops
in the entire country...

607
00:56:37,338 --> 00:56:39,532
and who I've worked with
for six years,

608
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:42,097
which is six years longer
than I've known you, my friend.

609
00:56:42,174 --> 00:56:46,839
Well, since you know him so well,
maybe you wanna explain
an $18,000 deposit...

610
00:56:46,912 --> 00:56:49,676
he made at First National
10 days ago.

611
00:56:49,748 --> 00:56:54,480
You've been doing makes
on my friends?
I've been doing
a little local research.

612
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:58,317
It's called staying alive.
I'll explain it to you sometime.

613
00:57:16,104 --> 00:57:19,664
<i>? Walking along
the beach last night ?</i>

614
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:23,334
? Who do you think I spy ?

615
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:27,107
? A girl with ebony fire eyes ?

616
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:31,014
? Soft and low do she cry ?

617
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:34,609
<i>? Now what could be
such a source of pain ?</i>

618
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:37,118
<i>? I so boldly inquire ?</i>

619
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,122
<i>That's not true.
That's not what he told me now.</i>

620
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,215
No?
Now, Crockett,
you told me that.

621
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,727
That he volunteered?
Oh, God. You're kidding me.

622
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,354
Aside from an occasional
massage parlor bust,

623
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:51,991
Sonny Crockett
has never volunteered
for anything his entire life.

624
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:57,833
Sorry to keep you waiting
so long, Theodore,
Senor Burnett.

625
00:57:57,906 --> 00:58:00,238
I trust dinner
was to your satisfaction.

626
00:58:00,308 --> 00:58:03,275
Righteous, man. Righteous.

627
00:58:03,343 --> 00:58:06,436
Gina and Trudy, my love,

628
00:58:06,512 --> 00:58:08,503
<i>the man, Trini DeSoto.</i>

629
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,209
<i>Los ojos son preciosos.</i>

630
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:22,153
Well, if you boys will excuse us,
Trudy and I are due for a little
paint and body work.

631
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:30,731
<i>Muy hermosas, huh?</i>

632
00:58:32,701 --> 00:58:36,568
It's in the coat check...
120 even.

633
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:38,695
<i>Good faith money, man.</i>

634
00:58:38,773 --> 00:58:41,206
<i>A working relationship,
remember?</i>

635
00:58:44,779 --> 00:58:47,245
I love this place, man.

636
00:58:47,314 --> 00:58:50,577
Pretty people,
first-class restrooms,

637
00:58:50,648 --> 00:58:53,913
selective door policy.

638
00:58:53,984 --> 00:58:56,215
? Only in Miami ?

639
00:58:56,288 --> 00:58:59,915
? Is Cuba so far away ??

640
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:04,050
Trini, come back, baby.
Come back.

641
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:08,087
Don't mind me, man.
I've been up four days running.

642
00:59:08,164 --> 00:59:10,655
What kind of weight
are we talking about, Teddy?

643
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:14,362
<i>I can have 10 million U.S.
At my disposal by noon tomorrow.</i>

644
00:59:14,436 --> 00:59:17,131
Forty grand a key.
You figure it out.

645
00:59:19,341 --> 00:59:23,868
I no making any promises,
but you have arrived
at a very opportunistic time.

646
00:59:23,944 --> 00:59:26,138
Tell me about this killer boat
of yours, Burnett.

647
00:59:27,448 --> 00:59:30,415
Thirty-nine feet, all engine.

648
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:34,418
It can handle a good 80 keys
and still outrun anything
that the Coast Guard's got.

649
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:38,478
In that case, you might
wanna have a second one
of the same on call.

650
00:59:40,158 --> 00:59:42,091
<i>Toda está bien.</i>

651
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:45,595
If you hear from us at all,
it'll be sometime tomorrow.

652
00:59:45,663 --> 00:59:49,097
<i>We'll be at the boat number,
day or night.</i>

653
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:52,327
Not so fast, Trini, man.
You said Calderone would be here.

654
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,598
He has been.

655
00:59:55,671 --> 00:59:58,468
Compliments from the gentleman
across the room, sir.

656
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:07,208
<i>Come on, y'all.</i>

657
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,837
Tubbs.

658
01:00:08,915 --> 01:00:11,509
? Ba-da ?

659
01:00:13,953 --> 01:00:17,285
? Whoa-oa-oa ?

660
01:00:17,356 --> 01:00:21,518
? Well, my friends
the time has come ?

661
01:00:21,592 --> 01:00:25,926
<i>? To raise the roof
and have some fun ?</i>

662
01:00:25,996 --> 01:00:30,398
<i>? Throw away the work to be done ?</i>

663
01:00:30,467 --> 01:00:34,162
<i>? Let the music play on
play on, play on ?</i>

664
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:38,969
<i>? Everybody sing
everybody dance ?</i>

665
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,134
<i>? Lose yourself in wild romance ?</i>

666
01:00:42,211 --> 01:00:48,045
? We're going to party
Come on and fiesta, forever ?

667
01:00:48,114 --> 01:00:50,446
? Come on and sing along ?

668
01:00:50,517 --> 01:00:56,421
<i>? We're going to party
Come on and fiesta, wherever?</i>

669
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:59,923
<i>? Come on and sing along ?</i>

670
01:00:59,992 --> 01:01:02,926
<i>? All night long ?
? All night ?</i>

671
01:01:02,994 --> 01:01:07,292
<i>? All night, all night long ?
? All night ?</i>

672
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:10,491
<i>? All night, all night long ?</i>

673
01:01:10,565 --> 01:01:14,002
Hospitable gesture,
Mr. Calderone.

674
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,799
Thank you.

675
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:19,363
I look forward to doing
business with you.

676
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:24,269
Welcome to Miami,
Senor Prentiss.

677
01:01:24,345 --> 01:01:28,281
<i>? See the rhythm all in their feet ?</i>

678
01:01:28,349 --> 01:01:32,682
<i>? Life is good wild and sweet ?</i>

679
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:36,881
<i>? Let the music play on
play on, play on ?</i>

680
01:01:36,954 --> 01:01:41,289
<i>? Feel it in your heart
and feel it in your soul ?</i>

681
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,793
? And let the music take control ?

682
01:01:43,861 --> 01:01:46,226
<i>? We're going to party ?</i>

683
01:01:46,296 --> 01:01:50,392
<i>? Come on and fiesta, forever?</i>

684
01:01:50,468 --> 01:01:53,300
<i>? Come on and sing my song ?</i>

685
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,668
<i>? All night long ?</i>

686
01:01:55,738 --> 01:01:58,103
What are you
gonna do, huh?

687
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:02,608
A regular Hoover convention
in the loo tonight.
Six legs to a stall.

688
01:02:02,676 --> 01:02:05,578
<i>I guess that's why they call it
the powder room, dear.</i>

689
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:08,410
Hey, partner, you okay?

690
01:02:08,481 --> 01:02:11,814
Yeah, mon, everything irie.

691
01:02:11,884 --> 01:02:14,614
Champagne, anybody?

692
01:02:14,686 --> 01:02:17,212
Look, I don't know about
you party types, but I gotta
be at work tomorrow.

693
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,315
So, can I just drop anyone?

694
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,950
Yeah, me.

695
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:25,495
Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

696
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:29,622
Good night.

697
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,223
Good night, Trudy.
Good night, Tubbs.

698
01:02:33,936 --> 01:02:37,497
I thought he said
his name was Prentiss.

699
01:02:37,573 --> 01:02:41,508
<i>No, it's Rafael Tubbs.
Did the, uh, computer
come back with anything?</i>

700
01:02:41,576 --> 01:02:43,702
Yeah, it sure did.

701
01:02:43,779 --> 01:02:46,941
I don't know who
that joker is, Crockett,
but according to the readout,

702
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:50,915
Detective Rafael Tubbs
has been dead and buried
over three weeks now.

703
01:03:02,861 --> 01:03:07,297
Come on,
pick up the phone, man.
Pick it up.

704
01:03:07,364 --> 01:03:09,628
I mean, who knows
who this guy is working for.

705
01:03:09,701 --> 01:03:13,465
D.E.A.? I.R.S.?
State? County?

706
01:03:13,536 --> 01:03:16,436
Never trust anyone
in this business.

707
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:18,440
Damn it.

708
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:21,634
<i>For all I know,
he could be working
for Calderone.</i>

709
01:03:21,711 --> 01:03:24,371
Well, unless you wanna wait
outside his hotel room all night,

710
01:03:24,447 --> 01:03:27,379
there's not a hell of a lot
you can do about it now anyway.

711
01:03:33,354 --> 01:03:37,221
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

712
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:40,985
Maybe I'm getting too old
for this line of work.

713
01:03:41,058 --> 01:03:43,892
Scraping by on four hours
of sleep a day.

714
01:03:43,962 --> 01:03:46,294
Living undercover
for weeks at a time.

715
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:48,559
Dealer this week,
outlaw biker the next.

716
01:03:48,632 --> 01:03:50,895
It's Tuesday?
I must be working drugs.

717
01:03:50,968 --> 01:03:53,902
<i>Hell on the old nervous system,
I'll tell you.</i>

718
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:58,372
- Disastrous on a marriage.
- I know.

719
01:03:59,975 --> 01:04:02,033
- Huh?
- The kind of work we do.

720
01:04:02,112 --> 01:04:04,044
It's tough on a relationship.

721
01:04:08,883 --> 01:04:11,408
You ever forget who you are?

722
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:19,316
Forget who I am?

723
01:04:19,392 --> 01:04:23,021
Darling, sometimes
I remember who I am.

724
01:04:26,064 --> 01:04:28,793
But what the heck.
I'm not complaining.

725
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:31,960
I got a terrific
six-year-old boy.

726
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,266
Six years old.

727
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:38,932
Two boats,
one freaked-out alligator.

728
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:43,807
<i>And a just-announced
free agency in the Southeast
string bikini league.</i>

729
01:04:43,878 --> 01:04:47,280
It's like the song says,

730
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:52,251
"She left me at Sears
and I cried all the way to Walgreens."

731
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:55,981
You can play that
beach bum, cowboy routine
with the football lingo...

732
01:04:56,054 --> 01:04:59,218
and the beer commercial mentality
from now till doomsday,

733
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:01,816
<i>but I don't believe it.</i>

734
01:05:03,495 --> 01:05:05,429
You know something, Gina.

735
01:05:10,401 --> 01:05:14,564
You can be a real pain
in the butt sometimes.

736
01:05:14,637 --> 01:05:17,266
But I like you.

737
01:05:19,108 --> 01:05:21,043
I like you a lot.

738
01:05:22,243 --> 01:05:24,576
I like you too, Sonny.

739
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,042
Oh, really.

740
01:05:29,116 --> 01:05:34,747
Well, why have you tossed
four dinner invitations
in three weeks back at me?

741
01:05:34,821 --> 01:05:39,815
And you wouldn't have come along
tonight if you hadn't had Trudy
along to block tackle.

742
01:05:39,893 --> 01:05:42,725
My father
always told me, Crockett,

743
01:05:42,794 --> 01:05:45,592
never to get involved
with a man on the rebound.

744
01:05:45,665 --> 01:05:48,461
And as far as I'm concerned,
you're bouncing so hard,

745
01:05:48,532 --> 01:05:51,195
you're practically
out of the ballpark.

746
01:05:52,903 --> 01:05:55,133
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

747
01:05:55,206 --> 01:05:57,140
You're still in love with Caroline.

748
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:07,678
Try again, lady.

749
01:06:47,249 --> 01:06:49,307
What are you looking at?

750
01:06:53,355 --> 01:06:56,186
Mm-mm-mm.
I'm in Miami.

751
01:06:56,256 --> 01:06:58,817
Mm-mm-mm!

752
01:07:06,499 --> 01:07:08,431
Gina?

753
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,628
<i>Hey, Crockett.
Rise and shine, buddy boy.
Crockett.!</i>

754
01:07:12,702 --> 01:07:15,694
Whoa, Elvis.

755
01:07:15,772 --> 01:07:19,401
<i>Hey, Crockett,
now you tell this lapdog of yours
he makes any false moves,</i>

756
01:07:19,476 --> 01:07:21,876
I'm gonna make a suitcase
out of him.

757
01:07:21,945 --> 01:07:24,377
Crockett?

758
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:27,905
Crockett.

759
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:31,781
This here's
a flare gun, sucker.

760
01:07:31,854 --> 01:07:35,288
So, unless you want
your entire intestinal tract
lit up like Cape Canaveral,

761
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,720
you got exactly 10 seconds
to tell me who you are.

762
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:40,054
You crazy, man?
What are you...
Eight seconds!

763
01:07:40,126 --> 01:07:42,094
What are you talking about, man?
You know who I am!

764
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,723
Rafael Tubbs died three weeks ago
in that New York shootout
with Calderone.

765
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:50,496
Four seconds.
Who are you, man?

766
01:07:50,569 --> 01:07:53,661
His brother.

767
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:55,899
I'm his brother, Crockett!

768
01:07:55,974 --> 01:07:59,407
<i>I know we all look alike
to you Southern crackers,
but not this much.</i>

769
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:02,502
Look at the picture, man.
Look at it!

770
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:12,653
<i>Rafael was the best.
He was the reason
why I became a cop.</i>

771
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:15,120
I.D.'s in my right pocket, man.

772
01:08:22,696 --> 01:08:26,960
Ricardo Tubbs, the Bronx.
Armed Robbery Division?

773
01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:29,192
Why?

774
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:31,827
Homicide up north
wasn't getting anywhere.

775
01:08:31,902 --> 01:08:34,633
The interdepartmental memo?

776
01:08:34,707 --> 01:08:37,970
Priority security clearance?
All forged.

777
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:40,099
<i>How else could I have
gotten down here?</i>

778
01:08:40,177 --> 01:08:44,669
<i>A Bronx street cop
on a Brooklyn narcotics
investigation?</i>

779
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:47,341
<i>Tell 'em there was
a death in the family?</i>

780
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:51,909
Or as a veteran detective
first-class on assignment?

781
01:08:51,987 --> 01:08:54,045
That bastard killed my brother.

782
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:58,215
Counterfeit setup bread,

783
01:08:58,291 --> 01:09:01,055
fake memos,
forged security clearance.

784
01:09:01,127 --> 01:09:03,287
Gee... God!

785
01:09:03,363 --> 01:09:06,058
<i>The biggest score of my entire
godforsaken career,</i>

786
01:09:06,131 --> 01:09:08,395
and I'm teamed up with
some outlaw New York street cop...

787
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:11,301
<i>out on a hit mission.
It's called justice, Crockett.</i>

788
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:13,894
It's called vengeance, my friend.
Plain and simple.

789
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:17,099
Now, I may seem somewhat
unorthodox to the untrained eye,

790
01:09:17,173 --> 01:09:20,801
but when it comes to being a cop,
I am strictly business, pal.

791
01:09:20,877 --> 01:09:24,836
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna put my life on the line
with some outlaw cop...

792
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:26,904
<i>on a personal vendetta.</i>

793
01:09:26,982 --> 01:09:29,917
<i>'Cause when it gets personal,
it gets messy.</i>

794
01:09:29,984 --> 01:09:33,715
<i>And when it gets messy,
the wrong people get killed.
¿Comprende?</i>

795
01:09:37,324 --> 01:09:39,258
I'm blowing the whistle
to Rodriguez.

796
01:09:39,327 --> 01:09:43,228
<i>You're out of this operation,
Tubbs, as of now.</i>

797
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,286
There is no operation
without me, Crockett.

798
01:09:45,363 --> 01:09:48,333
Calderone will back out
of this place so fast,
it'll make your badge spin.

799
01:09:52,736 --> 01:09:56,298
<i>It's probably them now.</i>

800
01:09:56,373 --> 01:09:59,433
<i>Four people dead,
two months'work
and all for nothing?</i>

801
01:10:01,578 --> 01:10:03,603
Crockett, please!

802
01:10:09,851 --> 01:10:11,784
Answer it.

803
01:10:12,821 --> 01:10:14,755
Yeah, mon.

804
01:10:18,025 --> 01:10:19,958
Three hundred pounds?

805
01:10:20,026 --> 01:10:22,756
8:00 tonight
off Virginia Key.
Geez.

806
01:10:22,829 --> 01:10:25,661
<i>Panamanian registered shrimp boat.
Terrific.</i>

807
01:10:25,731 --> 01:10:29,292
Oh, I took the liberty
of calling a little pregame
strategy meeting about, uh,

808
01:10:29,368 --> 01:10:31,302
10 minutes for all the backups...

809
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:34,804
Switek, Zito, Hoban, Dibble,
Gorman and Augustine.

810
01:10:34,872 --> 01:10:36,930
I figure we run down
the fine points then?

811
01:10:37,007 --> 01:10:39,841
<i>Terrific. Great.
Uh, what about, uh, Tubbs?</i>

812
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:42,106
I got him low-profiling it
on my boat till the party starts.

813
01:10:42,179 --> 01:10:47,047
<i>Lieutenant, you've got a call
from a Sister Agnes
at Immaculate Heart.</i>

814
01:10:47,116 --> 01:10:50,483
Uh, ye... Um, look, uh,
I'll have to get back to her.

815
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:59,156
Immaculate Heart?
Yeah.

816
01:10:59,226 --> 01:11:01,818
I'm sending my boy Hector
there in the fall.

817
01:11:01,895 --> 01:11:07,230
<i>Good school.
Expensive too.</i>

818
01:11:08,634 --> 01:11:10,931
Wish I could afford
to send Billy there.

819
01:11:11,002 --> 01:11:13,470
What's that supposed to mean?

820
01:11:13,537 --> 01:11:18,497
Nothing, Lou.
Seems like an awfully tough nut
to make on a lieutenant's salary.

821
01:11:19,576 --> 01:11:21,807
What's the matter
with you, Crockett?

822
01:11:21,879 --> 01:11:26,577
<i>If you wanna know
where I got the money,
just ask me.</i>

823
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:29,310
Okay, Lou,
where'd you get the money?

824
01:11:30,385 --> 01:11:31,977
None of your business.

825
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:36,253
Get outta here.

826
01:11:48,534 --> 01:11:51,730
You got the name trace yet
on those phone numbers
we found in Leon's apartment?

827
01:11:51,803 --> 01:11:54,295
Should have them
in about an hour for you, Sonny.

828
01:11:54,373 --> 01:11:56,671
For my eyes only, pal.
I need some blowups.

829
01:11:56,741 --> 01:12:00,337
Here and here.
High-priority rush.

830
01:12:00,411 --> 01:12:02,344
Yo, Crock.
Whenever you're ready,
Professor.

831
01:12:02,412 --> 01:12:04,345
Be with you
in a minute, girls.

832
01:12:04,414 --> 01:12:07,815
Sonny, you got
that Mendoza case?
L... Just a minute, Trudy.

833
01:12:10,153 --> 01:12:14,020
Gina, I, uh, got everything
straightened out on Tubbs.

834
01:12:14,089 --> 01:12:17,854
It was a little computer mix-up.

835
01:12:17,925 --> 01:12:20,917
You, uh, sure made
a fast exit this morning.

836
01:12:20,996 --> 01:12:23,189
I got nothing to say to you.

837
01:12:28,002 --> 01:12:30,025
Gina, what are you...

838
01:12:32,205 --> 01:12:34,230
Gina!

839
01:12:34,307 --> 01:12:38,366
Hey, Gina. Gina, wait.
What are you so mad about?

840
01:12:38,443 --> 01:12:41,205
Think about it.
I'll get back to you.

841
01:12:48,484 --> 01:12:51,943
Gina, look.
What are you doing in here?
Get out!

842
01:12:52,021 --> 01:12:55,649
Look, I didn't plan
for that to happen last night.

843
01:12:59,993 --> 01:13:03,861
<i>But I think it's pretty terrific
that it did.
Sensational, Crockett.</i>

844
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,764
Full moon, the boat,
a few drinks too many,

845
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:10,429
soft music, uh,
a little sudden onboard romance.

846
01:13:10,504 --> 01:13:14,165
<i>What's so bad about that?
Do you mind?</i>

847
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,506
<i>Funny thing is, is you know
I almost believed you
till this morning.</i>

848
01:13:18,576 --> 01:13:22,604
Nothing like having some guy
roll over at sunup and whisper
his ex-wife's name in your ear...

849
01:13:22,681 --> 01:13:26,171
to boost your self-image.

850
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:28,444
Gina, I'm really sorry.

851
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:32,386
This is the last situation
I wanted to find myself in, Crockett.

852
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:35,651
I don't need it.
Do you understand?

853
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:53,828
You know what...
You know what upsets me the most?

854
01:13:55,307 --> 01:13:59,140
Is that I let it happen
because I wanted it to happen.

855
01:14:17,726 --> 01:14:21,957
Hey, Elvis.
? You ain't nothin'
but an alligator ?

856
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:24,259
?Just a-cryin' all the time ?

857
01:14:24,331 --> 01:14:27,528
? You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine ??

858
01:14:34,107 --> 01:14:37,007
Hey, Waylon Jennings.

859
01:14:37,075 --> 01:14:40,339
GeorgeJones.
Jimmy Buffet.

860
01:14:40,412 --> 01:14:43,607
Dickey Betts.
Waylon Jennings.

861
01:14:43,681 --> 01:14:47,878
Hey, Elvis, where does
Crockett get his music?
Sears and Roebuck catalog?

862
01:14:51,923 --> 01:14:55,516
Oh, yeah.

863
01:14:55,592 --> 01:15:00,186
<i>Be cool, man.</i>

864
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:02,195
Let me see how this goes.

865
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,628
<i>St. Vitus Dance.</i>

866
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:09,532
Hey, Trini, mon.
What happening?

867
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:14,600
What do you mean...
change in plan?

868
01:15:14,673 --> 01:15:17,142
No, no, no change in plan, man.

869
01:15:20,412 --> 01:15:24,109
In 40 minutes.
I'll be there.

870
01:15:31,821 --> 01:15:35,654
Sonny Crockett.

871
01:15:35,724 --> 01:15:39,523
Switek, Zito and Augustine
in the Cobra out of Key Biscayne.

872
01:15:39,593 --> 01:15:43,324
Hoban, Dibble, and Gorman
in the 39-foot cigarette
out of Fisher Island.

873
01:15:43,397 --> 01:15:46,389
Two Metro choppers
and the C.G. Cutter
won't be given final coordinates...

874
01:15:46,468 --> 01:15:48,401
until 30 minutes
before blastoff.

875
01:15:48,468 --> 01:15:50,992
Any questions?
Yeah, I got a question.

876
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:53,404
You roll some fruit
for that shirt, or what?

877
01:15:55,475 --> 01:15:59,103
As a matter of fact, Stan,
your old lady gave me this shirt,
and it wasn't my birthday.

878
01:16:02,347 --> 01:16:06,340
Okay, weapons check
and final pep rally
back here at 1800, girls.

879
01:16:06,418 --> 01:16:08,611
That's big hand on the 12,
little hand on the six.

880
01:16:08,685 --> 01:16:10,619
Get outta here.

881
01:16:12,555 --> 01:16:14,921
Oh, grow up.

882
01:16:14,991 --> 01:16:17,960
Look at this.
Yea! Yea!

883
01:16:18,026 --> 01:16:21,860
<i>Say, baby.</i>

884
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:09,434
Wheeler.

885
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:12,700
If Wheeler's the leak,
then DeSoto knows Tubbs is a cop.

886
01:17:12,774 --> 01:17:15,503
<i>Didn't wanna
bust up the lecture
with any phone calls, Sonny,</i>

887
01:17:15,574 --> 01:17:18,042
but a guy named Tubbs
called about 20 minutes ago.

888
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:21,340
He said he's rushing out
for a meeting with
a Trini DeSoto or something.

889
01:18:08,418 --> 01:18:11,445
Waiting's over, dead man.

890
01:18:24,999 --> 01:18:29,094
Tubbs... you okay?

891
01:18:29,169 --> 01:18:31,103
Yeah, I'm all right.

892
01:18:45,484 --> 01:18:48,646
Tell Rodriguez to meet me
at 550 Belinda Street.

893
01:18:48,718 --> 01:18:50,745
Tell him I found the leak.

894
01:19:20,347 --> 01:19:23,406
Hey, Sonny.
What brings you out
to this neck of the woods?

895
01:19:23,482 --> 01:19:26,349
Come in, come in, come in.
Hey, uh, Donna, look who's here.

896
01:19:26,417 --> 01:19:28,818
Hey, Sonny. I hope
you brought an appetite.

897
01:19:28,887 --> 01:19:32,947
Hi, gang.
Uncle Sonny,
Mom's cooking spaghetti.

898
01:19:33,023 --> 01:19:35,491
Are you gonna eat?
No, not this time, son.

899
01:19:35,558 --> 01:19:37,493
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

900
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:40,359
You're gonna be sorry.
I know.

901
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:42,397
What's up?

902
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:03,171
If that's not enough,
I've got a list of payoffs
from DeSoto's place.

903
01:20:05,584 --> 01:20:08,212
I think we'd better
handle this outside.

904
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:15,523
Um, uh, honey,
I've got some business.
Um, I'll be right back.

905
01:20:15,591 --> 01:20:17,561
Don't be long, okay?
No, no, I won't.

906
01:20:25,099 --> 01:20:28,261
Three months behind
on the mortgage.

907
01:20:28,337 --> 01:20:33,671
Thirty-six grand in ScottJr.'s
medical expenses last year alone.

908
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,334
And me clearing
a lousy 30 a year,

909
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:39,969
getting shot at by guys
who blow that much
in a restaurant in a month.

910
01:20:45,084 --> 01:20:48,985
Six months ago, a guy comes up to me
outside of a club in Little Havana.

911
01:20:49,054 --> 01:20:51,579
Hands me a suitcase.

912
01:20:51,655 --> 01:20:55,182
He says, " Compliments
of Mr. Calderone."

913
01:20:55,259 --> 01:20:58,126
Nothing else.

914
01:20:58,194 --> 01:21:01,789
Just... compliments.

915
01:21:07,135 --> 01:21:11,036
I didn't even open
the damn thing for two weeks.

916
01:21:11,105 --> 01:21:14,472
Sonny...
How much?

917
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:17,669
How much to buy you, Scottie?

918
01:21:22,581 --> 01:21:24,515
Seventy grand.

919
01:21:27,186 --> 01:21:30,780
The calls from DeSoto
started about a month later.

920
01:21:33,758 --> 01:21:38,558
Information.
That's all they wanted
was information.

921
01:21:38,629 --> 01:21:40,926
Information?

922
01:21:40,998 --> 01:21:45,194
I tried to pull out
at least a dozen times,
but it was too late.

923
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:52,032
I mean, I never expected
anybody to get killed.

924
01:21:52,106 --> 01:21:54,768
They changed the game plan
on us, Scott.

925
01:21:54,842 --> 01:21:58,334
Is it still going down
tonight?

926
01:21:58,412 --> 01:22:01,211
Yeah.
Where?

927
01:22:01,282 --> 01:22:03,772
You gotta help me, man.
You gotta help me, man.
I got a family.

928
01:22:03,849 --> 01:22:06,716
Where? Where?
I got 15 years
as a stand-up cop.

929
01:22:06,785 --> 01:22:09,379
I got two medals of valor.
I took a bullet for you,
for God's sakes.

930
01:22:29,872 --> 01:22:33,306
They're runnin' a sports fishing boat
out of Keys Marina.

931
01:22:35,677 --> 01:22:38,009
The drop-off's up river.

932
01:22:46,285 --> 01:22:50,882
Am I, uh,
am I missing something here,
or what, Scottie?

933
01:22:50,956 --> 01:22:53,423
I don't get it.

934
01:22:53,491 --> 01:22:55,457
I don't understand this.

935
01:22:59,296 --> 01:23:01,355
You were my partner.

936
01:23:02,532 --> 01:23:07,195
I had you and Donna
and the kids over to dinner,
what, 20 or 30 times.

937
01:23:08,671 --> 01:23:11,729
Thanksgiving, birthdays.

938
01:23:11,807 --> 01:23:13,741
I trusted you!

939
01:23:13,809 --> 01:23:17,836
I trusted you, you bastard!
I trusted you!

940
01:23:17,912 --> 01:23:21,642
I trusted you!
Crockett!

941
01:24:20,164 --> 01:24:26,123
<i>? I can feel it coming
in the air tonight ?</i>

942
01:24:26,202 --> 01:24:29,638
<i>? Oh, Lord ?</i>

943
01:24:29,706 --> 01:24:33,072
<i>How much time we got?
? I've been waiting
for this moment ?</i>

944
01:24:33,142 --> 01:24:36,133
<i>Twenty-five minutes.
? All of my life ?</i>

945
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:40,236
<i>? Oh, Lord ?</i>

946
01:24:40,312 --> 01:24:45,307
<i>? Can you feel it
coming in the air tonight ?</i>

947
01:24:46,553 --> 01:24:48,985
<i>? Oh, Lord ?</i>

948
01:24:49,054 --> 01:24:51,249
<i>? Oh, Lord ?</i>

949
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:04,528
<i>? Well, if you told me
you were drowning ?</i>

950
01:25:04,601 --> 01:25:06,899
<i>? I would not lend a hand ?</i>

951
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:10,336
Honey, don't do that.
Come on, use your spoon.

952
01:25:10,407 --> 01:25:12,839
You know better than that.
I want to eat it like this.

953
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:15,375
No. Hello.

954
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,673
<i>? But I don't know
if you know who I am ?
Caroline.</i>

955
01:25:17,744 --> 01:25:19,679
Sonny?

956
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:24,675
I need to know something, Caroline.

957
01:25:26,452 --> 01:25:29,013
The way we used to be together.

958
01:25:29,088 --> 01:25:31,751
L-I don't mean lately,

959
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:33,759
but before.

960
01:25:33,826 --> 01:25:37,227
<i>? It's all been a pack oflies ?</i>

961
01:25:37,296 --> 01:25:39,854
It was real, wasn't it?

962
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:41,864
<i>? Well, I remember?</i>

963
01:25:41,932 --> 01:25:44,869
<i>Yeah, it was.
? I remember don't worry ?</i>

964
01:25:44,936 --> 01:25:47,426
You bet it was.

965
01:25:47,504 --> 01:25:50,665
<i>? How could I ever forget ?
Sonny, what's wrong?</i>

966
01:25:50,738 --> 01:25:53,264
<i>? The first time ?</i>

967
01:25:53,342 --> 01:25:57,072
<i>? The last time we ever met ?
Nothing, Caroline.</i>

968
01:25:59,914 --> 01:26:05,715
<i>? But I know the reason why
you keep your silence up ?</i>

969
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:10,383
<i>? No, you don't fool me ?</i>

970
01:26:10,456 --> 01:26:12,788
<i>? Well, the hurt doesn't show ?</i>

971
01:26:12,859 --> 01:26:15,191
<i>? But the pain still grows ?</i>

972
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:18,491
<i>? Some stranger to you and me ?</i>

973
01:26:21,732 --> 01:26:27,692
<i>? I can feel it coming
in the air tonight ?</i>

974
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,637
<i>? Oh, Lord ?</i>

975
01:26:31,707 --> 01:26:37,669
<i>? I've been waiting for this moment
all of my life ?</i>

976
01:26:37,745 --> 01:26:40,737
<i>? Oh, Lord ?</i>

977
01:26:40,816 --> 01:26:45,079
<i>? I can feel it
in the air tonight ?</i>

978
01:26:45,151 --> 01:26:47,644
<i>? Oh, Lord ?</i>

979
01:26:47,721 --> 01:26:51,589
<i>? Oh, Lord
Oh, Lord, oh ?</i>

980
01:26:51,658 --> 01:26:54,592
<i>? But I've been waiting
for this moment ?</i>

981
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:57,890
<i>? For all my life ?</i>

982
01:26:57,962 --> 01:27:00,658
<i>? Oh, Lord
Oh, Lord ?</i>

983
01:27:04,068 --> 01:27:06,331
Hey, hold on, pal.

984
01:27:06,403 --> 01:27:09,600
Why, I forgot something?
Yeah, us.

985
01:28:03,952 --> 01:28:06,511
<i>Miguel, Tito, adelante.</i>

986
01:28:12,725 --> 01:28:14,852
Freeze!

987
01:28:16,396 --> 01:28:20,353
Miami Vice, drop 'em!
Drop 'em.

988
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:46,876
<i>Mátalo.</i>

989
01:30:37,146 --> 01:30:39,137
Come on, you $400-a-week cop.

990
01:30:41,817 --> 01:30:44,012
It's getting late.

991
01:30:44,086 --> 01:30:46,782
<i>Gotta arrest me now.</i>

992
01:30:49,824 --> 01:30:51,757
You're not gonna
shoot me, are you?

993
01:30:51,826 --> 01:30:55,419
It's against the law.
It's against the law.

994
01:31:18,415 --> 01:31:22,474
<i>Tubbs, not like this, man.</i>

995
01:31:24,321 --> 01:31:26,344
Not like this, Tubbs.

996
01:32:02,819 --> 01:32:07,345
<i>Contact a female subject
at 1549 East Charleston.</i>

997
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:11,550
<i>1549 East Charleston
will be at the Bell, Book and Candle.</i>

998
01:32:15,028 --> 01:32:18,327
<i>What do you mean
you're gonna transfer him?
What's wrong with this jail?</i>

999
01:32:18,397 --> 01:32:20,796
By hiding Calderone away
in an out-of-town lockup,

1000
01:32:20,866 --> 01:32:24,926
we buy the D.A. Enough time
to prepare a no-bail plea
at the preliminary tomorrow.

1001
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:26,938
Yeah, but he's
still due a phone call.

1002
01:32:27,005 --> 01:32:30,702
Can't his people just hire
some crooked judge to cruise on up
to the suburbs and spring him?

1003
01:32:30,775 --> 01:32:34,233
Nobody will know
he's in the suburbs,
not even Calderone himself.

1004
01:32:34,311 --> 01:32:36,471
We're transferring him
in a blacked-out paddy wagon.

1005
01:32:36,546 --> 01:32:39,070
Because I don't like those people.
Hey, Dolan,
you're a genius.

1006
01:32:39,148 --> 01:32:41,480
Look, honey, if you wanna
eat with those people,
you eat with them.

1007
01:32:41,551 --> 01:32:43,485
Come on. Tonight.

1008
01:32:43,553 --> 01:32:45,850
Honey, I'll call you back.
I gotta go.

1009
01:32:45,921 --> 01:32:49,879
Transfer of a prisoner...
Calderone, Orlando.

1010
01:32:49,957 --> 01:32:52,425
Let's see.

1011
01:32:52,493 --> 01:32:58,191
Cabanez, Cadwood,
Caldoni, Calderone.

1012
01:32:58,264 --> 01:33:00,528
<i>Oh, yeah.
How he got
some judge in here...</i>

1013
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,396
this hour of the morning
beats the hell out of me.

1014
01:33:02,467 --> 01:33:04,766
- What judge?
- Ajudge?

1015
01:33:04,839 --> 01:33:06,771
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

1016
01:33:06,839 --> 01:33:09,034
<i>What do you mean gone?
How could you let him go?</i>

1017
01:33:09,106 --> 01:33:11,802
- Had to. He had a judge with him.
- How long ago?

1018
01:33:11,876 --> 01:33:15,038
<i>I don't know... 10, 15 minutes.
What's the big deal?</i>

1019
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:17,875
Nobody skips
on two million dollars bail.

1020
01:33:32,627 --> 01:33:35,322
<i>Gonna need two units
at 244 Baycrest Drive.</i>

1021
01:33:35,396 --> 01:33:38,262
No, 4-4.
It's a residence.

1022
01:33:38,332 --> 01:33:40,230
<i>Yeah.</i>

1023
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:45,100
<i>Come on. Come on.!</i>

1024
01:34:09,858 --> 01:34:13,587
<i>The hell with the channels,
there's not enough time.!</i>

1025
01:34:17,865 --> 01:34:20,833
- For cryin' out loud!
- Run it!

1026
01:35:20,482 --> 01:35:22,951
I'm sorry.

1027
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:25,180
It's not your fault, man.

1028
01:35:31,826 --> 01:35:37,731
He'll be back.
New name, new people.
But he'll be back.

1029
01:35:37,799 --> 01:35:40,426
Hell, this is
the Sunshine State, right?

1030
01:35:50,576 --> 01:35:54,203
I guess you got a job
to get back to up there
in New York, hey, Tubbs?

1031
01:35:54,278 --> 01:35:56,474
Get outta here, Crockett.
You kidding?

1032
01:35:56,546 --> 01:35:59,311
After the little show
I put on down here hits the fan,

1033
01:35:59,384 --> 01:36:02,443
I'll be lucky
to get back on payroll
as a meter maid.

1034

Hey, Tubbs,

1035
01:36:12,661 --> 01:36:17,098
you ever consider a career
in Southern law enforcement?

1036
01:36:17,165 --> 01:36:19,428
Maybe.

1037
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,798
Maybe.
