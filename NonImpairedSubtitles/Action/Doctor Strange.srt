1
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,182
Master Kaecilius.

2
00:02:26,788 --> 00:02:29,915
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

3
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,408
Hypocrite!

4
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,490
Challenge round, Billy.

5
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,299
Oh, come on, Billy. You've
got to be messing with me.

6
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,000
No, doctor.

7
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,609
Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.

8
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:19,626
Seriously, Billy, you said this one would be hard.
- Hah! It's 1978.

9
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:22,510
No, Billy, while Feels So
Good may have charted in 1978,

10
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,999
the album was released
in December, 1977.

11
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,729
No, no. Wikipedia says the...
- Check again.

12
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:31,379
When did you...?
- Where do you store all this useless information?

13
00:05:31,854 --> 00:05:35,047
Useless? The man charted a
top ten hit with a Flugelhorn.

14
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:38,676
- Status, Billy? -
1977. - All clean.

15
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:39,499
I hate you.

16
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,400
Woah! "Feels so good", doesn't it?

17
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,089
Oh, I... I've got this, Stephen. You've
done your bit. Go ahead, we'll close up.

18
00:05:50,404 --> 00:05:52,105
- What is that?
- GSW. <font color="#fdff44"><i>(Gunshot wound)</i></font>

19
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:56,331
It's amazing you kept him alive.

20
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:58,332
Apneic, further brain stem
testing after reflex test...

21
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,417
I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer.

22
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:03,887
You left a bullet in his head.
- Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

23
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:09,100
I needed a specialist to diagnose brain death.
Something about that doesn't feel right to me.

24
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,000
We have to run.

25
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:15,510
Dr. West! What are you doing? Hey!
- Organ harvesting. He's a donor.

26
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:19,499
Slow down. I did not agree to that.
- I don't need you to. We've already called brain death.

27
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,955
Too premature. We need to get him
prepped for a suboccipital craniotomy.

28
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:24,600
I'm not going to let you operate on a dead man.
- What do you see?

29
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:30,649
A bullet?
- A perfect bullet. It's been hardened. You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

30
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,399
A toxic metal. And as it leaks directly
into the cerebral spinal fluid...

31
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:37,000
Rapid-onset central nervous
system shutdown. - We need to go.

32
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:39,200
The patient's not dead, but he's dying.
Do you still want to harvest his organs?

33
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll assist you.
- No! Dr. Palmer will assist me.

34
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:02,091
Thank you.

35
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,463
Image status, STAT.
- We do not have time for that.

36
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,099
You can't do it by hand.
- I can and I will.

37
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,413
This isn't the time for
showing off, Strange.

38
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:20,313
How about ten minutes ago, when
you called the wrong time of death?

39
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,830
Cranial nerves intact.

40
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:58,105
Dr. West, cover your watch.

41
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:44,199
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

42
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,000
I didn't have to save his patient either. But,
you know, sometimes I just can't help myself.

43
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,500
Nick is a great doctor.
- You came to me.

44
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,300
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.
- You had a second opinion.

45
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:58,500
What you needed was a competent one.
- Well, all the more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call.

46
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,900
You could make such a difference.

47
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,825
I can't work in your butcher shop.
- Hey! Look, he...

48
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:05,700
Look, I'm using transsectioned spinal cords to
stimulate neurogenesis in the central nervous system.

49
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,910
My work is at least going to
save thousands for years to come.

50
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:10,900
In the ER, I get to save
one drunk idiot with a gun.

51
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:13,178
Yeah, you're right. In the
ER, you're only saving lives.

52
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:15,960
There's no fame, there's
no CNN interviews...

53
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,486
Well, I guess I'll
have to stick with Nick.

54
00:09:18,521 --> 00:09:21,330
Oh, wait a minute. You're
not... you guys aren't...

55
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:25,900
What?
- Sleeping together. Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

56
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:26,749
Explicit, actually.

57
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,700
And no, I have a very strict
rule against dating colleagues.

58
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,600
Oh really?
- I call it the Strange policy.

59
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:34,500
Oh, good! I'm glad
something is named after me.

60
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:36,500
You know, I invented a
laminectomy procedure,

61
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:39,799
and yet, somehow, no one seems to
want to call it the Strange technique.

62
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,800
We invented that technique.
- You know, I gotta say, I'm very flattered by your policy.

63
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:49,876
Look, I'm talking tonight at a
Neurological Society dinner. Come with me.

64
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:53,900
Another speaking
engagement? So romantic.

65
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:55,400
You used to love going
to those things with me.

66
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:57,500
We had fun together.
- No. You've had fun.

67
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:00,954
They weren't about us,
they were about you.

68
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:05,200
- Not only about me.
- Stephen. Everything is about you.

69
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:10,299
Maybe we can hyphenate.
Strange-Palmer technique.

70
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,100
Palmer-Strange.

71
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,000
Billy! What have you got for me?

72
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:05,950
I've got a 35-year-old Air Force
colonel. Crushed his lower spine

73
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:08,998
in some kind of experimental armor.
Mid-thoracic vertebral fracture.

74
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,799
Well, I could help, but
so can 50 other people.

75
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,600
Find me something worth my time.

76
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,499
I have a 68-year-old female with
an advanced brain stem glioma.

77
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,900
Yeah, you want me to screw up my
perfect record? Definitely not.

78
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:23,849
How about a 22-year-old
female with an electronic

79
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,884
implant in her brain to control
schizophrenia struck by lightning?

80
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:28,864
That does sound interesting.

81
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,098
Could you send me the... got it.

82
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:37,043
Hey.

83
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:40,100
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

84
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,310
What did they do?

85
00:12:57,484 --> 00:13:02,800
They rushed you in a chopper. But
it took a little while to find you.

86
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:06,499
Golden hours for nerve damage
went by while you were in the car.

87
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,500
What did they do?!?

88
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:15,000
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

89
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,704
Multiple torn ligaments.

90
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:21,168
Severe nerve damage in both hands.

91
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,400
You were on the table for 11 hours.

92
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,610
Look at these fixators.

93
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:30,700
No one could have done better.

94
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,848
I could have done better.

95
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:10,500
No. No.
- Give your body time to heal.

96
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:14,200
You ruined me.

97
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:16,849
How long until I'm...

98
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,999
Dr. Strange... those
tissues are still healing.

99
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,520
So speed it up. Pass the stent under the
brachial artery under the radial artery.

100
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:26,225
It's possible.

101
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:29,800
Experimental and
expensive, but possible.

102
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:31,574
All I need is possible.

103
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:57,196
Up.

104
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,314
Up.

105
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,015
Show me your strength.

106
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,200
Ah! It's useless.
- It's not useless, man, you can do this.

107
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,479
Then answer me this, bachelor's degree.

108
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:19,200
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage this severe

109
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,900
to do this, and actually recover?

110
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:27,086
One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke
his back. Paralyzed. His leg wasted away.

111
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,870
He had pain in his shoulder
from the wheelchair.

112
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,200
He came in 3 times a week.

113
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:35,190
But one day he stopped
coming. I thought he was dead.

114
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,998
A few years later, he
walked past me on the street.

115
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:42,300
He walked? - Yeah, he walked.
- Bullshit. Show me his file.

116
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:45,180
It can take me a while to pull
the files from the archive.

117
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:48,130
But if it proves your
arrogant ass wrong,

118
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:49,850
it's worth it.

119
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:06,100
I looked at all your research.

120
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:10,340
I read all the papers you've
sent, but... none will work.

121
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:14,199
I... I don't think you realize
how severe the damage is, I...

122
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,300
Look, here's the thing, I...
- At best, I'd try and fail.

123
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:18,990
Look, I understand.
Here's the thing. I...

124
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:22,120
What you want from me is impossible, Stephen.
- Come on...

125
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:24,656
I've got my own reputation to consider.
- Etienne, wait.

126
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:28,000
I can't help you...
- No. No, no, wait!

127
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:35,043
Hi.

128
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:42,523
He won't do it.

129
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:46,415
He's a hack.

130
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:51,235
There's a new procedure in Tokyo.
They culture donor stem cells

131
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:55,300
and then harvest them and 3D-print a scaffold.
If I could get a loan together, just...

132
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:57,150
Stephen...
- A small loan, 200,000.

133
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,803
Stephen. You've always spent
money as fast as you could make it

134
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,998
but now you're spending
money you don't even have.

135
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,500
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

136
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,400
No. Now is exactly the time not to stop.

137
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:10,899
Because, you see, I'm
not getting any better!

138
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,208
But this isn't medicine
anymore. This is mania.

139
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:17,250
Some things just can't be fixed.

140
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,279
Life without my work...
- Is still life.

141
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,500
This isn't the end. There are other
things that can give your life meaning.

142
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,200
Like what? Like you?

143
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,600
And this is the part
where you apologize.

144
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:32,800
This is the part where you leave.

145
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,999
Fine. I can't watch you do
this to yourself anymore.

146
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,890
Too difficult for you, is it?
- Yes.

147
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,900
It is. And it breaks my heart to see you this way.
- No. Don't pity me.

148
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:46,503
I'm not pitying you.
- Oh yeah? Then what are you doing here?

149
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:48,998
Bringing cheese and wine as if
we're old friends going for a picnic?

150
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,009
We are not friends, Christine.
We were barely lovers.

151
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,000
You just love a sob story, don't
you? Is that what I am to you now?

152
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:57,640
Poor Stephen Strange, charity case.

153
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,260
He finally needs me. Another dreg
of humanity for you to work on.

154
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:04,010
Fix him up and send him back into
the world, heart is just humming...

155
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:07,300
You care so much! Don't you?!?

156
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:13,567
Goodbye, Stephen.

157
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:50,200
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Told
you so!</i></font>

158
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:59,999
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Pangborn, J.
Metropolitan General Hospital</i></font>

159
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,600
Come on, man! Where is the competition?

160
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:14,346
You talk a lot!

161
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,300
Jonathan Pangborn, C7-C8
spinal cord injury, complete.

162
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:23,250
Who are you? - Paralyzed
from the mid-chest down.

163
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:24,990
Partial paralysis of both hands.

164
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't know you.

165
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:30,300
I'm Stephen Strange. I'm a
neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.

166
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:33,900
Actually, you know what,
man? I think I know you.

167
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:36,972
I came to your office
once. You refused to see me.

168
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:38,788
I never got past your assistant.

169
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:43,911
You were untreatable.
- No glory for you in that, right?

170
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:48,999
You came back from a place
there is no way back from!

171
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,150
I... I'm trying to find my own way back.

172
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,200
Hey, Pangborn, you in it or not?

173
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,420
Alright.

174
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,800
I'd given up on my body.

175
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:17,800
I thought my mind was the only thing I had
left. I should at least try to elevate that.

176
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,300
So I sat with gurus, and sacred women.

177
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:24,531
Strangers carried me to
mountain tops to see holy men.

178
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,550
And finally, I found my teacher.

179
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:32,800
And my mind was elevated.
And my spirit deepened.

180
00:20:33,454 --> 00:20:36,412
And somehow... - Your
body healed. - Yes.

181
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,749
And there were deeper
secrets to learn then,

182
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,710
but I did not have the
strength to receive them.

183
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:45,720
I chose to settle for my
miracle, and I came back home.

184
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,590
The place you're looking
for is called Kamar-Taj.

185
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,250
But the cost is high.
- How much?

186
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,700
I'm not talking about money.

187
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,420
Good luck.

188
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:05,173
Give me the ball!

189
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,300
<font color="#fdff44"><b>Kathmandu,
Nepal</b></font>

190
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,599
Excuse me. Kamar-Taj?

191
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:31,300
Do you know where Kamar-Taj is?

192
00:21:43,962 --> 00:21:46,374
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Sign: "Himalayan

193
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:56,692
Kamar-Taj?

194
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,460
Kamar-Taj...

195
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:29,577
Okay.

196
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:35,752
Guys, I... I don't have any money.
- Your watch.

197
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:40,899
No, please. It's all I have left.
- Your watch.

198
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:45,137
Alright.

199
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:27,207
You're looking for Kamar-Taj?

200
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:01,000
Really? Are you sure
you got the right place?

201
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,205
That one looks a little
more... Kamar-y Taj-y.

202
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,999
I once stood in your place.

203
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:14,500
And I, too, was... disrespectful.

204
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,999
So might I offer you some advice?

205
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,500
Forget everything you think you know.

206
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:25,999
Uh... alright.

207
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,200
The sanctuary of our
teacher. The Ancient One.

208
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:41,567
The Ancient One? What's his real name?

209
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,500
Right. Forget everything
I think I know. I'm sorry.

210
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:59,127
Thank you for... huh!

211
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,996
Okay, that's, uh... a thing...

212
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:05,889
Thank you.

213
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,715
Hello.

214
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,300
Uh, thank you. And thank you.

215
00:25:11,797 --> 00:25:16,250
Uh, thank you, Ancient
One... for... seeing me...

216
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:17,700
You're very welcome.

217
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,303
The Ancient One.
- Thank you, Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir!

218
00:25:25,314 --> 00:25:27,014
Mr. Strange!

219
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:31,640
Doctor, actually.
- Well, no. Not anymore, surely.

220
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:36,200
Isn't that why you're here?
You've undergone many procedures.

221
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,700
Seven, right?
- Yeah...

222
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:41,432
Good tea.

223
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:49,830
Did you heal a man named
Pangborn? A paralyzed man.

224
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:53,200
In a way.
- You helped him to walk again.

225
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:58,800
Yes. - How do you correct a
complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

226
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:01,200
Oh, I didn't correct it.

227
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:03,500
He couldn't walk; I
convinced him that he could.

228
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:05,668
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

229
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:09,900
When you reattach a severed nerve, is it
you who heals it back together or the body?

230
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:15,600
It's the cells.
- And the cells are only programmed to put themselves together in very specific ways.

231
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:18,998
That's right.
- What if I told you that your own body could be convinced

232
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:22,700
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

233
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:25,999
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

234
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:29,021
That's... bleeding-edge medical tech.

235
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:32,290
Is that why you're working here,
without a governing medical board?

236
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,591
I mean... just how
experimental is your treatment?

237
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:37,554
Quite.

238
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:42,900
So, you figured out a way to
reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

239
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,337
No, Mr. Strange.

240
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,999
I know how to reorient the
spirit to better heal the body.

241
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:55,200
Spirit... to heal the body.

242
00:26:56,966 --> 00:27:01,200
Huh. A... al... al... alright. How
do we do that? Where do we start?

243
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,000
Don't like that map?

244
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:14,900
Oh, no. It's... it's very good. It's just...
you know, I've seen it before. In gift shops.

245
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:19,999
And what about this one? -
Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?

246
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:22,600
What about... that one?

247
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:25,485
You're showing me an MRI
scan? I can not believe this.

248
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,440
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone
who could see in part, but not the whole.

249
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:33,330
I spent my last dollar getting here

250
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:36,730
on a one-way ticket, and you're talking
to me about healing through belief?

251
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,500
You're a man who's looking at
the world through a keyhole,

252
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:42,323
and you spent your whole life
trying to widen that keyhole.

253
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:47,180
To see more, know more. And now,
on hearing that it can be widened

254
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:50,800
in ways you can't imagine,
you reject the possibility?

255
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:56,850
No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy
tales about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief.

256
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:59,460
There is no such thing as spirit!

257
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:02,800
We are made of matter, and nothing more.

258
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:07,440
We're just another tiny, momentary
speck within an indifferent universe.

259
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:11,150
You think too little of yourself.
- Oh, you think you see through me, do you?

260
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:15,520
Well, you don't. But I see through you!

261
00:28:32,996 --> 00:28:36,958
What did you just do to me?!?
- I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.

262
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:40,220
What's in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD?

263
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,026
Just tea.

264
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,850
With a little honey.

265
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:47,950
What just happened?
- For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.

266
00:28:47,952 --> 00:28:51,700
What?
- A place where the soul exists apart from the body.

267
00:28:51,701 --> 00:28:56,999
Why are you doing this to me?
- To show you just how much you don't know.

268
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,250
Open your eye.

269
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,700
No! No... No! Shit!

270
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:10,843
Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!

271
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:13,844
This isn't real it isn't real it isn't

272
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,637
<b><i>His pulse is reaching
dangerous levels.</i></b>

273
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,721
He looks alright to me.

274
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,800
You think you know how the world works?

275
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:42,500
You think that this material
universe is all there is?

276
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,500
What is real?

277
00:29:50,698 --> 00:29:53,800
What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?

278
00:29:55,809 --> 00:30:00,483
At the root of existence,
mind and matter meet.

279
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,500
Thoughts create reality.

280
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,900
This universe is only
one of an infinite number.

281
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,200
Worlds without end.

282
00:30:26,228 --> 00:30:28,999
Some benevolent and life-giving;

283
00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:34,999
others filled with malice and hunger.

284
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:44,200
Dark places, where powers
older than time lie...

285
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:47,709
ravenous... and waiting.

286
00:30:54,643 --> 00:31:00,899
Who are you in this vast
multiverse, Mr. Strange?

287
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:24,200
Have you seen that
before in a gift shop?

288
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:32,701
Teach me!

289
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,520
No.

290
00:31:41,424 --> 00:31:43,124
No... No!

291
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:45,650
No, no, no, no no no no!

292
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,800
No! Open the door! Please!

293
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:56,506
Thank you, Masters.

294
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:03,800
You think I'm wrong to cast him out?

295
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:06,500
5 hours later, he's
still on your doorstep.

296
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:09,282
There's a strength to him.

297
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:14,210
Stubbornness, arrogance,
ambition... I've seen it all before.

298
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,800
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

299
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,640
I can not lead another
gifted student to power,

300
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:21,750
only to lose him to the darkness.

301
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:28,138
You didn't lose me. I wanted
the power to defeat my enemies.

302
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,900
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

303
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:35,200
And to live within the natural law.

304
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:37,500
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

305
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:40,300
We only learn to live above them.

306
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:45,900
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

307
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:49,400
If he deciphers them, he
could bring ruin upon us all.

308
00:32:50,653 --> 00:32:52,550
There may be dark days ahead.

309
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,150
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could
use a man like Strange.

310
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:07,900
Don't shut me out.

311
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,900
I've nowhere else to go.

312
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:19,706
Thank you.

313
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:25,882
Bed.

314
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:28,248
Rest.

315
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,220
Meditate...

316
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:31,983
if you can.

317
00:33:32,274 --> 00:33:34,280
The Ancient One will send for you.

318
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,300
Uh, what's this? My mantra?

319
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,800
The Wi-Fi password.

320
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:50,500
We're not savages.

321
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:15,520
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Time will tell
how much I love you. ~ Christine</i></font>

322
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:26,350
The language of the mystic
arts is as old as civilization.

323
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,999
The sorcerers of antiquity called
the use of this language "spells".

324
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,500
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities,

325
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:36,914
you can call it "program".

326
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:40,250
The source code that shapes reality.

327
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,550
We harness energy

328
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:47,700
drawn from other dimensions
of the multiverse,

329
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:50,950
to cast spells,

330
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:54,999
conjure shields

331
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:57,200
and weapons

332
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,350
to make magic.

333
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,999
But... even if my fingers could do that,

334
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:21,600
My hands would just be
waving in the air. I mean,

335
00:35:21,618 --> 00:35:23,700
how do I get from here to there?

336
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:26,210
How did you get to
reattach severed nerves,

337
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:30,180
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

338
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:32,500
Study and practice. Years of it.

339
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:42,787
Hey.

340
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:48,850
Mr. Strange.
- Uh... Stephen, please.

341
00:35:49,211 --> 00:35:51,911
- And you are?
- Wong. - Wong.

342
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:55,899
Just Wong? Like... Adele?

343
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,850
Or... Aristotle.

344
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:03,700
Drake. Bono.

345
00:36:06,482 --> 00:36:08,300
Eminem.

346
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,300
The book of the invisible sun.

347
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:15,890
Astronomia Nova.

348
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:17,992
Codex Imperium.

349
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:20,050
Key of Solomon.

350
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:24,390
You finished all of this?
- Yup.

351
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,780
Come with me.
- Alright.

352
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:30,911
This section is for Masters only.

353
00:36:30,913 --> 00:36:33,290
But at my discretion, others may use it.

354
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,290
We should start with Maxim's Primer.

355
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,850
How is your Sanskrit?

356
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:44,890
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

357
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:48,200
Read it. Classical Sanskrit.

358
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:54,300
What are those?

359
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:56,700
The Ancient One's private collection.

360
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,981
So they're forbidden?

361
00:36:59,031 --> 00:37:02,620
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is
forbidden. Only certain practices.

362
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:09,180
Those books are far too advanced for
anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

363
00:37:20,253 --> 00:37:22,050
This one's got pages missing.

364
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:26,080
That's the book of
Cagliostro. The study of time.

365
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:29,120
One of the rituals was
stolen by a former Master.

366
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:32,800
A zealot called Kaecilius.

367
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:36,995
Just after he strung
up the former librarian,

368
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:39,460
and relieved him of his head.

369
00:37:42,311 --> 00:37:44,400
I'm now the guardian of these books.

370
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:49,600
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again, I'd know it.

371
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:52,950
And you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

372
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:58,499
What if it's just overdue? You know?

373
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:02,099
Any... late fees I should know
about? Maybe, perhaps, uhm...

374
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,001
Uh, you know, people used
to think that I was funny.

375
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,500
Did they work for you?

376
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:15,690
Alright. Well, it's been lovely talking to you,
thank you for the books and for the horrifying story

377
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:18,511
and for the threat upon my life.

378
00:38:48,872 --> 00:38:52,420
Now we receive the power to
destroy the one who betrayed us.

379
00:38:55,017 --> 00:38:57,050
The one who betrays the world.

380
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,080
Mastery of the sling ring is
essential to the mystic arts.

381
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,350
They allow us to travel
throughout the multiverse.

382
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:05,999
All you need to do is focus.

383
00:40:06,242 --> 00:40:07,999
Visualize.

384
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:10,550
See the destination in your mind.

385
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:14,220
Look beyond the world in front of you.

386
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:17,460
Imagine every detail.

387
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:22,999
The clearer the picture,
the quicker, and easier,

388
00:40:23,012 --> 00:40:25,120
the gateway will come.

389
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:29,950
And stop.

390
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,190
I'd like a moment
alone with Mr. Strange.

391
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:34,890
Of course.

392
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:41,199
My hands.
- It's not about your hands.

393
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:42,999
How is this not about my hands?

394
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,750
Master Hamir.

395
00:40:58,543 --> 00:41:00,299
Thank you, Master Hamir.

396
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:03,500
You cannot beat a river into submission.

397
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:08,910
You have to surrender to its current,
and use its power as your own.

398
00:41:09,214 --> 00:41:12,352
I... I control it by surrendering
control? That doesn't make any sense.

399
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:15,560
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

400
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,690
Your intellect has
taken you far in life.

401
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:20,429
But it will take you no further.

402
00:41:20,518 --> 00:41:22,260
Surrender, Stephen.

403
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:24,520
Silence your ego

404
00:41:25,124 --> 00:41:26,860
and your power will rise.

405
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:29,455
Follow me.

406
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:36,725
Wait. Is this...
- Everest.

407
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:45,260
It's beautiful.
- Yeah, you're right. Beautiful. It's freezing, but... beautiful.

408
00:41:45,331 --> 00:41:49,500
At this temperature, a
person can last for 13 minutes

409
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:53,000
before suffering permanent loss of function.
- Great.

410
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:58,000
But you will likely go into shock within the first 2 minutes.
- What?

411
00:41:58,001 --> 00:42:00,999
Surrender, Stephen.
- No, no! Don't!

412
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:13,150
How is our new recruit?
- We shall see.

413
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:15,400
Any second now.

414
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,380
No, not again.

415
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:26,050
Maybe I should...

416
00:43:39,499 --> 00:43:41,760
Stephen.
- Wong.

417
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,880
What do you want, Strange?
- Books on astral projection.

418
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,370
You're not ready for that.
- Try me, Beyoncé.

419
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,360
Come on. You've heard of
her. She's a huge star, right?

420
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,150
Do you ever laugh?

421
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,670
Oh come on, just give me the book, huh?

422
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,985
No.

423
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,550
Once, in this room, you
begged me to let you learn.

424
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,900
Now I'm told you question every
lesson, prefering to teach yourself.

425
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:42,800
Once, in this room, you
told me to open my eyes.

426
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,590
Now I'm being told to blindly
accept rules that make no sense.

427
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,999
Like the rule against conjuring
a gateway in the library?

428
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,500
Wong told on me?
- You're advancing quickly with your sorcery skills.

429
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:55,710
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

430
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,220
You are now inside the Mirror Dimension.

431
00:45:16,575 --> 00:45:18,600
ever present but undetected.

432
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:22,103
The real world isn't
affected by what happens here.

433
00:45:22,903 --> 00:45:26,371
We use the Mirror
Dimension to train, surveil,

434
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,541
and sometimes to contain threats.

435
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:32,453
You don't want to be stuck in
here without your sling ring.

436
00:45:32,488 --> 00:45:35,452
Hold on. Sorry, what
do you mean, threats?

437
00:45:44,813 --> 00:45:47,085
Learning of an infinite multiverse

438
00:45:47,086 --> 00:45:49,387
included learning of infinite dangers.

439
00:45:49,422 --> 00:45:53,837
And if I told you everything else that you don't
already know, you'd run from here in terror.

440
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:02,231
So, just how ancient is she?

441
00:46:04,682 --> 00:46:06,788
No one knows the age
of the Sorcerer Supreme.

442
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:10,852
Only that she is Celtic and
never talks about her past.

443
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,615
You follow her even
though you don't know?

444
00:46:12,816 --> 00:46:15,130
I know that she's
steadfast, but unpredictable.

445
00:46:15,534 --> 00:46:17,234
Merciless, yet kind.

446
00:46:18,562 --> 00:46:20,262
She made me what I am.

447
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:25,500
Trust your teacher.
And don't lose your way.

448
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,159
Like Kaecilius?
- That's right.

449
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,074
You knew him.

450
00:46:35,616 --> 00:46:39,017
When he first came to us, he'd
lost everyone he ever loved.

451
00:46:39,052 --> 00:46:40,765
He was a grieving and broken man,

452
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:43,061
searching for answers
in the mystic arts.

453
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:46,556
A brilliant student, but
he was proud, headstrong.

454
00:46:46,665 --> 00:46:49,241
Questioned the Ancient
One, rejected our teaching.

455
00:46:56,476 --> 00:46:58,176
He left Kamar-Taj.

456
00:46:58,391 --> 00:47:01,016
His disciples followed him like sheep

457
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:03,261
seduced by false doctrine.

458
00:47:03,296 --> 00:47:06,359
He stole the forbidden ritual, right?
- Yeah.

459
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:08,698
What did it do?

460
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:12,190
No more questions.

461
00:47:13,102 --> 00:47:15,521
What's that?
- That's a question.

462
00:47:17,194 --> 00:47:18,894
This is a relic.

463
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:22,490
Some magic is too powerful to
sustain, so we imbue objects with it.

464
00:47:23,713 --> 00:47:26,003
allowing them to take
the strain we can not.

465
00:47:26,174 --> 00:47:30,750
This is the Staff of
the Living Tribunal.

466
00:47:34,346 --> 00:47:36,046
There are many relics.

467
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,762
The Wand of Watoomb.

468
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,541
The Bolting Boots of Voltor.

469
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:43,677
They just roll of the tongue,
don't they? When do I get my relic?

470
00:47:43,678 --> 00:47:46,190
When you're ready.
- I think I'm ready.

471
00:47:46,225 --> 00:47:48,809
You're ready when the
relic decides you're ready.

472
00:47:49,596 --> 00:47:51,296
For now,

473
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:53,991
conjure a weapon.

474
00:47:54,629 --> 00:47:56,517
Yeah.

475
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:06,352
Fight! Fight like your
life depended on it!

476
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:14,691
Because one day, it may.

477
00:48:35,063 --> 00:48:38,147
<font
color="#fdff44"><i>Christine</i></font>

478
00:48:42,224 --> 00:48:46,800
<font color="#fdff44"><i>I'm emailing
you one more time to</i></font>

479
00:49:25,441 --> 00:49:27,141
Wong?

480
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:40,611
Okay.

481
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:43,629
First, open the Eye of Agamotto.

482
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:05,769
Alright.

483
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:30,883
Oh my.

484
00:51:07,784 --> 00:51:09,484
Dormammu.

485
00:51:10,953 --> 00:51:12,653
The Dark Dimension.

486
00:51:13,288 --> 00:51:14,988
Eternal life?

487
00:51:20,988 --> 00:51:22,688
Stop!

488
00:51:25,745 --> 00:51:27,989
Tampering with the continuum
of probability is forbidden!

489
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:30,335
I... I wa... I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book!

490
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:33,669
And what did the book say about the
dangers of performing that ritual?

491
00:51:33,704 --> 00:51:35,571
Yeah, I don't know. I hadn't
gotten to that part yet.

492
00:51:35,588 --> 00:51:38,172
Temporal manipulations can
create branches in time.

493
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:40,617
Unstable dimensional openings.

494
00:51:40,652 --> 00:51:43,494
Spacious paradoxes! Time loops!

495
00:51:43,543 --> 00:51:46,812
You want to get stuck reliving the
same moment over, and over, forever,

496
00:51:46,847 --> 00:51:48,547
or never having existed at all?

497
00:51:49,499 --> 00:51:51,608
They really should put the
warnings before that stuff.

498
00:51:51,678 --> 00:51:53,585
Your curiosity could
have gotten you killed.

499
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,175
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum,

500
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,305
you were wrecking it.

501
00:51:58,635 --> 00:52:02,081
We do not tamper with
natural law. We defend it.

502
00:52:02,094 --> 00:52:03,794
How did you learn to do that?

503
00:52:05,014 --> 00:52:07,922
Where did you learn the litany of
spells required to even understand it?

504
00:52:07,957 --> 00:52:11,500
I've got a photographic memory. It's how
I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

505
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:15,500
What you just did takes
more than a good memory.

506
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:16,999
You were born for the mystic arts.

507
00:52:17,216 --> 00:52:20,549
And yet, my hands still shake.
- For now, yes.

508
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:23,116
Not forever?
- We're not prophets.

509
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:25,330
When do you start
telling me what we are?

510
00:52:30,735 --> 00:52:34,653
While heroes like the Avengers protect
the world from physical dangers,

511
00:52:35,062 --> 00:52:37,963
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

512
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:43,156
The Ancient One is the latest in
a long line of Sorcerers Supreme

513
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:46,763
Going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts,

514
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:48,498
the mighty Agamotto.

515
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:53,353
The same sorcerer who created the
eye you so recklessly borrowed.

516
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,717
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums
in places of power,

517
00:52:57,752 --> 00:53:00,305
where great cities now stand.

518
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,396
That door leads to
the Hong Kong Sanctum,

519
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:05,455
that door to the New York Sanctum.

520
00:53:06,258 --> 00:53:07,958
That one, to the London Sanctum.

521
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:12,707
Together, the Sanctums generate a
protective shield around our world.

522
00:53:13,632 --> 00:53:17,096
The Sanctums protect the
world, and we sorcerers

523
00:53:17,503 --> 00:53:20,510
protect the Sanctums.
- From what?

524
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:23,608
Other-dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

525
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,151
Like Dormammu?

526
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:28,636
Where did you learn that name?

527
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,154
I just read it in the
book of Cagliostro. Why?

528
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:39,355
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.

529
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:42,759
Beyond time.

530
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:47,202
He is the cosmic conquerer,
the destroyer of worlds.

531
00:53:47,629 --> 00:53:50,408
A being of infinite
power and endless hunger,

532
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:53,480
on a quest to invade every universe

533
00:53:53,515 --> 00:53:56,375
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

534
00:53:57,488 --> 00:53:59,812
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

535
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,140
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

536
00:54:03,786 --> 00:54:07,403
A ritual to contact Dormammu and
draw power from the Dark Dimension.

537
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,407
Uuuh... okay. Okay.

538
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:19,413
I... time-out. I... I
came here to heal my hands,

539
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:23,838
not to fight in some mystical war.

540
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:27,899
London.

541
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:32,894
Kaecilius!

542
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,595
No!

543
00:54:40,089 --> 00:54:41,789
Wong? Mordo?

544
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,248
<font color="#fdff44"><i>177A
Bleecker Street</i></font>

545
00:55:32,836 --> 00:55:34,536
Hello?

546
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,101
Hello?

547
00:56:43,144 --> 00:56:46,505
Daniel. I see they made
you Master of the Sanctum.

548
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:49,512
Do you know what that means?

549
00:56:50,348 --> 00:56:52,048
That you'll die protecting it.

550
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:09,973
Stop!

551
00:57:20,655 --> 00:57:22,904
How long have you been
at Kamar-TaJ, Mister...?

552
00:57:23,188 --> 00:57:24,888
Doctor.

553
00:57:25,741 --> 00:57:28,943
Just Doctor?
- It's Strange.

554
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:33,247
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

555
00:59:57,875 --> 00:59:59,862
You don't know how to use that, do you?

556
01:01:44,964 --> 01:01:46,664
What?

557
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,500
You'll die here.
- Oh, stop it.

558
01:01:52,901 --> 01:01:54,054
I said, stop it!

559
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:57,537
You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor.
- Why... look, I don't even know what "this" is.

560
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:01,231
It's the end and the beginning.

561
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:03,885
The many becoming the
few, becoming the One.

562
01:02:05,678 --> 01:02:09,000
Look, if you're not going to start making sense,
I'm just going to have to put this thing back on.

563
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:10,175
Tell me, Mr. Doctor.

564
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:13,395
Alright, look. My name
is Dr. Stephen Strange.

565
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:16,608
You are a doctor? -
Yes. - A scientist.

566
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:22,122
You understand the laws of nature.
All things age. All things die.

567
01:02:22,345 --> 01:02:25,860
In the end, our sun burns out, our
universe grows cold and perishes.

568
01:02:26,741 --> 01:02:28,537
But the Dark Dimension...

569
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:30,645
it's a place beyond time.

570
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,106
That's it. I'm putting this thing back
on. This world doesn't have to die, Doctor.

571
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:37,074
This world can take its rightful
place among so many others,

572
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:38,809
as part of the One.

573
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:40,756
The great and beautiful One.

574
01:02:41,739 --> 01:02:43,439
And we can all live forever.

575
01:02:43,753 --> 01:02:45,453
Really?

576
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:50,508
What do you have to gain out of
this New Age dimensional utopia?

577
01:02:51,341 --> 01:02:54,932
The same as you. The same as
everyone. Life. Eternal life.

578
01:02:56,032 --> 01:02:58,043
People think in terms of good and evil,

579
01:02:58,078 --> 01:03:01,451
but really, time is the true enemy
of us all. Time kills everything.

580
01:03:01,452 --> 01:03:03,350
What about the people you killed?

581
01:03:03,385 --> 01:03:07,484
Tiny, momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

582
01:03:09,448 --> 01:03:11,148
Yes. You see,

583
01:03:12,142 --> 01:03:13,975
you see what we're doing?

584
01:03:14,918 --> 01:03:18,681
The world is not what it ought to
be. Humanity longs for the eternal,

585
01:03:19,138 --> 01:03:21,575
for a world beyond time,
because time is what enslaves us.

586
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:23,748
Time is an insult.

587
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:26,232
Death is an insult.

588
01:03:27,278 --> 01:03:28,978
Doctor...

589
01:03:29,549 --> 01:03:31,736
We don't seek to rule this world.

590
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:34,659
We seek to save it, to
hand it over to Dormammu,

591
01:03:34,694 --> 01:03:37,244
who is the intent of all evolution,

592
01:03:38,006 --> 01:03:39,706
the Why of all existence.

593
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:43,488
The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

594
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:49,161
What was it that brought you to
Kamar-Taj, Doctor? Was it enlightenment?

595
01:03:49,871 --> 01:03:51,571
Power?

596
01:03:52,844 --> 01:03:55,183
You came to be healed, as did we all.

597
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,853
Kamar-Taj is a place that
collects broken things.

598
01:03:59,858 --> 01:04:01,686
We all come with the
promise of being healed,

599
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:04,466
but instead, the Ancient
One gives us parlor tricks.

600
01:04:06,007 --> 01:04:08,150
The real magic she keeps for herself.

601
01:04:08,185 --> 01:04:11,556
Have you ever wondered how
she managed to live this long?

602
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,171
I... I saw the rituals
in the book of Cagliostro.

603
01:04:19,206 --> 01:04:21,832
So, you know.

604
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:26,976
The ritual gives me the power to overthrow
the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down,

605
01:04:27,011 --> 01:04:29,491
to let the Dark Dimension in.

606
01:04:30,047 --> 01:04:33,402
Because what the Ancient One
hoards, Dormammu gives freely.

607
01:04:34,606 --> 01:04:36,306
Life, everlasting.

608
01:04:36,948 --> 01:04:40,272
He is not the destroyer of worlds,
Doctor, he is the savior of worlds.

609
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:45,000
No. I mean, come on. Look at your face.

610
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:47,884
Dormammu made you a murderer.

611
01:04:48,101 --> 01:04:50,554
Just how good can his kingdom be?

612
01:04:52,403 --> 01:04:54,103
You think that's funny?

613
01:04:54,378 --> 01:04:56,078
No. No, Doctor.

614
01:04:56,207 --> 01:04:58,765
What's funny is that
you've lost your sling ring.

615
01:06:06,895 --> 01:06:09,391
Sir, can I help you?
- Dr. Palmer, where is she?

616
01:06:09,493 --> 01:06:12,383
Sir, we need to... - Where is
she? - At the nurses station.

617
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:14,255
Christine!

618
01:06:15,852 --> 01:06:20,767
Stephen? Oh my god. What...
- We need to get me on an operation table now. Just you.

619
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,640
Now! I don't have any time!

620
01:06:22,992 --> 01:06:26,496
What happened?
- Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

621
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,575
What are you wearing?

622
01:06:35,789 --> 01:06:40,537
The chest cavity is clear.
- The blood... is in the pericardial sac.

623
01:06:42,609 --> 01:06:44,914
No. No no no no no no
no! Stephen! Stephen!

624
01:07:13,494 --> 01:07:15,194
Just a little higher.

625
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,460
Please be careful with the needle.

626
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:21,992
Stephen?

627
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,763
Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing?
- My astral body.

628
01:07:28,247 --> 01:07:31,103
Are you dead?
- No, Christine, but I am dying.

629
01:07:33,446 --> 01:07:35,576
Right. Right.

630
01:07:36,921 --> 01:07:40,298
Yeah. Alright.

631
01:07:49,405 --> 01:07:51,125
I've... I've never seen
a wound like this before.

632
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:53,352
What were you stabbed with?

633
01:07:53,793 --> 01:07:55,493
I don't know.

634
01:08:14,564 --> 01:08:17,266
I'm going to have to vanish now.
- No, I...

635
01:08:17,808 --> 01:08:19,508
Keep me alive, will you?

636
01:08:22,582 --> 01:08:24,473
Okay! Okay.

637
01:08:49,135 --> 01:08:50,835
Bullshit!

638
01:09:21,124 --> 01:09:22,824
<font color="#fdff44"><i>Charging
to 200 Joule</i></font>

639
01:09:33,886 --> 01:09:35,586
Stephen, come on.

640
01:09:38,055 --> 01:09:40,924
Hit me again!
- Stop doing that!

641
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:42,804
Up the voltage and hit me again.

642
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:45,150
No, your heart is beating!
- Just do it!

643
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,660
Oh god!

644
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:20,531
Are you ok?
- Yeah.

645
01:10:21,991 --> 01:10:23,691
Okay.

646
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:32,609
After all this time,
you just show up here,

647
01:10:34,493 --> 01:10:38,047
flying out of your body?
- Yeah, I know.

648
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,460
I missed you too, by the way.

649
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:44,606
I wrote 2 emails, but
you never responded.

650
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:46,341
Why would I?

651
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:49,223
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

652
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,198
For all of it. And you were right,

653
01:10:52,233 --> 01:10:56,053
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly

654
01:10:56,088 --> 01:11:00,282
and you deserved so much more.
- Stop. You... you're clearly in shock.

655
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:03,771
I mean, what the hell is happening?

656
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,400
Where have you been?

657
01:11:06,665 --> 01:11:09,850
Well, after Western medicine failed me,

658
01:11:09,885 --> 01:11:12,800
I headed East, and I
wound up in Kathmandu.

659
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,310
Kathmandu?
- Yeah.

660
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,403
What, like the Bob Seger song?
- 1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. And then,

661
01:11:20,438 --> 01:11:22,200
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj

662
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:27,616
and I talked to someone
called the Ancient One, and...

663
01:11:28,898 --> 01:11:32,102
Oh. So you joined a cult.
- No, I didn't. Not exactly. I mean,

664
01:11:32,137 --> 01:11:35,211
they did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

665
01:11:35,246 --> 01:11:37,561
Yeah, that sounds like a cult.
- It's not a cult.

666
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:40,869
Well, that's what a cultist would say.
- Oh, no.

667
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:43,879
Wait, Stephen... what do
you think you're doing?

668
01:11:43,914 --> 01:11:45,614
I'm late for a cult meeting.

669
01:11:49,734 --> 01:11:51,534
This is insane.
- Yeah.

670
01:11:51,569 --> 01:11:53,575
Where are you going?

671
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:55,684
Uhm...
- Just tell me the truth?

672
01:11:55,685 --> 01:11:59,823
Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave
himself over to an ancient entity

673
01:11:59,831 --> 01:12:02,491
who can bend the very laws of
physics, tried very hard to kill me,

674
01:12:02,496 --> 01:12:04,458
but I left him chained
up in Greenwich Village,

675
01:12:04,463 --> 01:12:06,586
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway

676
01:12:06,587 --> 01:12:10,711
that I opened up in the mop closet.
- Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

677
01:12:21,195 --> 01:12:23,178
I really do have to go.

678
01:13:10,461 --> 01:13:12,161
Strange!

679
01:13:14,268 --> 01:13:17,949
You're okay.
- A relative term, but yeah, I'm okay.

680
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:20,480
The Cloak of Levitation.

681
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,200
It came to you.

682
01:13:23,636 --> 01:13:25,336
No minor feat.

683
01:13:26,025 --> 01:13:27,725
It's a fickle thing.

684
01:13:27,801 --> 01:13:29,956
He's escaped. -
Kaecilius? - Yeah.

685
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:33,757
He can fold space and matter at will.

686
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:39,118
He folds matter outside the mirror dimension? In the real world?
- Yeah.

687
01:13:39,643 --> 01:13:41,453
How many more?
- Two.

688
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:47,145
I stranded one in the desert. - And
the other? - His body was in the hall.

689
01:13:47,146 --> 01:13:50,943
Master Drumm was in the foyer. -
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

690
01:13:50,944 --> 01:13:52,644
The London Sanctum has fallen.

691
01:13:53,273 --> 01:13:57,458
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

692
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:00,686
You defended the New
York Sanctum from attack.

693
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:03,234
With its Master gone, it needs another,

694
01:14:03,269 --> 01:14:05,249
Master Strange.

695
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:09,426
No.

696
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:11,799
It is Dr. Strange.

697
01:14:11,834 --> 01:14:14,139
Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange,

698
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:16,079
Doctor Strange.

699
01:14:17,339 --> 01:14:20,683
When I became a doctor, I
swore an oath to do no harm.

700
01:14:20,718 --> 01:14:23,785
And I have just killed a
man! I'm not doing that again.

701
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,468
I became a doctor to
save lives, not take them.

702
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:30,632
You become a doctor to save
one life above all others.

703
01:14:30,688 --> 01:14:32,461
Your own.

704
01:14:32,496 --> 01:14:36,264
Still seeing through me, are you?
- I see what I've always seen.

705
01:14:36,299 --> 01:14:38,453
Your overinflated ego.

706
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:41,657
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything,

707
01:14:42,237 --> 01:14:45,229
even death, which no one can control.

708
01:14:45,264 --> 01:14:47,952
Not even the great
doctor Stephen Strange.

709
01:14:48,368 --> 01:14:50,578
Not even Dormammu?

710
01:14:52,012 --> 01:14:53,712
He offers immortality.

711
01:14:53,977 --> 01:14:55,949
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

712
01:14:55,984 --> 01:14:59,326
He feeds off it.
- Like you feed on him?

713
01:14:59,327 --> 01:15:02,818
You talk to me about controlling
death. Well, I know how you do it.

714
01:15:02,853 --> 01:15:05,839
I've seen the missing rituals
from the book of Cagliostro.

715
01:15:06,888 --> 01:15:10,060
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

716
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:11,951
Because you might not like them?

717
01:15:11,986 --> 01:15:14,699
Because you may not
know of what you speak.

718
01:15:14,734 --> 01:15:17,473
What is he talking about?
- I'm talking about her long life.

719
01:15:17,508 --> 01:15:19,483
The source of her immortality.

720
01:15:21,826 --> 01:15:24,640
She draws power from the
Dark Dimension to stay alive.

721
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,399
That's not true.
- I've seen the rituals and worked them out.

722
01:15:31,315 --> 01:15:33,015
I know how you do it.

723
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:37,255
Once they regroup, the
zealots will be back.

724
01:15:38,362 --> 01:15:40,062
You'll need reinforcements.

725
01:15:47,573 --> 01:15:51,302
She is not who you think she is.
- You don't have the right to say that.

726
01:15:51,337 --> 01:15:56,014
You have no idea of the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.
- No, and I don't want to know.

727
01:15:56,379 --> 01:16:00,492
You're a coward. - Because I'm not a killer?
- These zealots will snuff us all out,

728
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:03,559
and you can muster the strength
to snuff them out first?

729
01:16:03,594 --> 01:16:06,545
What do you think I just did?
- You saved your own life!

730
01:16:07,451 --> 01:16:11,603
And then whined about it like a wounded dog.
- When you would have done it so easily?

731
01:16:11,638 --> 01:16:14,618
You have no idea. The
things I've done...

732
01:16:16,302 --> 01:16:18,002
And the answer is yes.

733
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:21,539
Without hesitation.
- Even if there's another way?

734
01:16:21,574 --> 01:16:25,000
There is no other way.
- You lack imagination.

735
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:29,968
No, Stephen. You lack a spine.

736
01:16:35,047 --> 01:16:36,747
They're back.

737
01:16:43,059 --> 01:16:45,016
We have to end this. Right now!

738
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:53,483
Strange! Get down here and fight!

739
01:16:59,707 --> 01:17:01,407
The Mirror Dimension.

740
01:17:01,619 --> 01:17:03,813
You can't affect the real world in here.

741
01:17:04,389 --> 01:17:07,244
Who's laughing now, asshole?

742
01:17:09,453 --> 01:17:11,153
I am.

743
01:17:24,023 --> 01:17:26,513
They've got no sling ring. I
mean, they can't escape, right?

744
01:17:27,898 --> 01:17:29,598
Trei!

745
01:17:45,789 --> 01:17:49,457
Their connection to the Dark Dimension makes
them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension.

746
01:17:49,492 --> 01:17:52,451
They can't affect the real
world, but they can still kill us.

747
01:17:52,457 --> 01:17:54,763
This wasn't clever. This was suicide!

748
01:18:11,551 --> 01:18:13,251
That is hilarious.

749
01:18:59,889 --> 01:19:01,589
This was a mistake.

750
01:20:33,968 --> 01:20:35,668
It's true.

751
01:20:36,548 --> 01:20:39,009
She does draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

752
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:44,808
Kaecilius.

753
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:49,982
I came to you, broken,

754
01:20:50,148 --> 01:20:52,367
lost, bleeding.

755
01:20:52,402 --> 01:20:55,973
I trusted you to be my
teacher, and you fed me lies.

756
01:20:56,008 --> 01:20:59,807
I tried to protect you. - From
the truth? - From yourself.

757
01:20:59,842 --> 01:21:04,331
I have a new teacher now.
- Dormammu deceives you.

758
01:21:05,045 --> 01:21:07,292
You have no idea of what he truly is.

759
01:21:07,327 --> 01:21:12,320
His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.
- Liar.

760
01:22:08,747 --> 01:22:12,520
Christine!
- Are you kidding me?

761
01:22:13,643 --> 01:22:15,343
Oh my god.

762
01:22:16,956 --> 01:22:18,692
No fibrillation...

763
01:22:19,221 --> 01:22:20,921
It's neurogenic?
- Yes.

764
01:22:29,518 --> 01:22:31,218
Nick?

765
01:22:33,209 --> 01:22:35,097
We need to relieve the
pressure on her brain.

766
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:42,000
She still drops. - We're losing her!
- You need to increase her oxygen!

767
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:45,062
I need a crash cart!
- Her pupils are dilated!

768
01:22:45,172 --> 01:22:48,797
No reflexes. I'm not
reading any brain activity.

769
01:22:59,546 --> 01:23:01,246
What are you doing?

770
01:23:01,802 --> 01:23:03,502
You're dying!

771
01:23:12,356 --> 01:23:15,052
You have to return to your
body now. You don't have time.

772
01:23:15,087 --> 01:23:19,041
Time is relative. Your body
hasn't even hit the floor yet.

773
01:23:21,047 --> 01:23:24,281
I've spent so many years
peering through time,

774
01:23:24,784 --> 01:23:26,767
looking at this exact moment.

775
01:23:27,117 --> 01:23:29,067
But I can't see past it.

776
01:23:29,278 --> 01:23:32,647
I've prevented countless
terrible futures.

777
01:23:32,682 --> 01:23:35,223
And after each one,
there's always another.

778
01:23:35,769 --> 01:23:37,733
And they all lead here,

779
01:23:38,404 --> 01:23:41,176
but never further.
- You think this is where you die.

780
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:45,675
Do you wonder what I see in your future?
- No.

781
01:23:47,929 --> 01:23:52,674
Yes.
- I never saw your future. Only its possibilities.

782
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:56,649
You have such a capacity for goodness.

783
01:23:56,684 --> 01:23:58,607
You always excelled,

784
01:23:58,642 --> 01:24:00,800
but not because you crave success,

785
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:03,094
but because of your fear of failure.

786
01:24:03,593 --> 01:24:05,556
It's what made me a great doctor.

787
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:08,413
It's precisely what
kept you from greatness.

788
01:24:09,299 --> 01:24:11,587
Arrogance and fear still keep you

789
01:24:11,622 --> 01:24:14,687
from learning the simplest and
most significant lesson of all.

790
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:16,830
Which is?

791
01:24:18,212 --> 01:24:19,912
It's not about you.

792
01:24:24,178 --> 01:24:25,903
When you first came to me,

793
01:24:25,938 --> 01:24:28,824
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

794
01:24:29,788 --> 01:24:31,488
I didn't.

795
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:36,552
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

796
01:24:37,745 --> 01:24:40,294
He uses magic to walk.
- Constantly.

797
01:24:40,978 --> 01:24:42,678
He had a choice,

798
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:45,413
to return to to his own life

799
01:24:46,269 --> 01:24:48,271
or to serve something
greater than himself.

800
01:24:48,306 --> 01:24:50,803
So, I could have my hands back again?

801
01:24:51,312 --> 01:24:53,012
My old life?

802
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:55,156
You could.

803
01:24:55,814 --> 01:24:58,579
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

804
01:25:00,068 --> 01:25:02,910
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

805
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:06,843
But as you well know, sometimes
one must break the rules

806
01:25:06,878 --> 01:25:10,685
in order to serve the greater good.
- Mordo won't see it that way.

807
01:25:11,196 --> 01:25:13,846
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable,

808
01:25:13,881 --> 01:25:16,005
forged by the fires of his youth.

809
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:19,909
He needs your flexibility,
just as you need his strength.

810
01:25:21,306 --> 01:25:25,014
Only together do you stand a
chance of stopping Dormammu.

811
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:27,110
I'm not ready.

812
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,580
No one ever is.

813
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:34,528
We don't get to choose our time.

814
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:40,024
Death is what gives life meaning.

815
01:25:41,745 --> 01:25:43,765
To know your days are numbered,

816
01:25:44,396 --> 01:25:46,096
your time is short.

817
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:51,056
You'd think after all
this time I'd be ready.

818
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:53,138
But look at me,

819
01:25:53,139 --> 01:25:55,863
stretching one moment
out into a thousand,

820
01:25:56,615 --> 01:25:58,595
just so I can watch the snow.

821
01:26:37,584 --> 01:26:39,284
Are you okay?

822
01:26:46,857 --> 01:26:49,395
I don't understand what's happening.
- I know.

823
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,620
But I have to go right now.

824
01:26:58,732 --> 01:27:01,221
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end,

825
01:27:01,256 --> 01:27:04,038
that it could be a beginning.
- Yeah.

826
01:27:06,049 --> 01:27:08,542
Because there are other
ways to save lives.

827
01:27:12,047 --> 01:27:13,747
A harder way.

828
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,700
A weirder way.

829
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:21,355
Dr. Palmer, the ER,
please. Dr. Palmer, the ER.

830
01:27:26,025 --> 01:27:27,725
I don't want to let you go.

831
01:28:15,943 --> 01:28:17,643
Stop.

832
01:28:22,156 --> 01:28:25,420
<font color="#fdff44"><b>Hong
Kong</b></font>

833
01:28:46,842 --> 01:28:48,542
Choose your weapon wisely.

834
01:28:52,112 --> 01:28:53,838
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

835
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:58,282
No one.

836
01:29:13,596 --> 01:29:17,261
Kaecilius.
- You're on the wrong side of history, Wong.

837
01:29:30,063 --> 01:29:33,372
She's dead.
- You were right.

838
01:29:34,223 --> 01:29:36,644
She wasn't who I thought she was.

839
01:29:37,173 --> 01:29:38,873
She was complicated.

840
01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:45,536
Complicated?

841
01:29:48,378 --> 01:29:50,194
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

842
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,502
Dangerous.

843
01:29:52,897 --> 01:29:54,597
What if it overtook her?

844
01:29:56,113 --> 01:29:58,154
She taught us it was forbidden,

845
01:29:59,255 --> 01:30:03,038
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

846
01:30:03,073 --> 01:30:05,215
She did what she thought was right.

847
01:30:05,228 --> 01:30:06,928
The bill comes due.

848
01:30:07,989 --> 01:30:09,689
Don't you see?

849
01:30:11,462 --> 01:30:13,947
Her transgressions led
the zealots to Dormammu.

850
01:30:13,982 --> 01:30:17,953
Kaecilius was her fault.

851
01:30:18,467 --> 01:30:21,600
And here we are, in the
consequence of her deception.

852
01:30:25,345 --> 01:30:28,777
A world on fire.
- Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen.

853
01:30:28,812 --> 01:30:32,690
And New York has been attacked. Twice.
You know where they're going next.

854
01:30:33,285 --> 01:30:36,913
Hong Kong.
- You told me once to fight as if my life depended on it,

855
01:30:36,919 --> 01:30:39,718
because one day, it might.
Well, today is that day.

856
01:30:40,321 --> 01:30:42,417
I can not defeat them alone.

857
01:31:00,352 --> 01:31:02,052
The Sanctum has already fallen.

858
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:11,658
The Dark Dimension.

859
01:31:13,187 --> 01:31:14,887
Dormammu is coming.

860
01:31:17,026 --> 01:31:18,773
It's too late.

861
01:31:18,774 --> 01:31:20,474
Nothing can stop him.

862
01:31:22,413 --> 01:31:24,113
Not necessarily.

863
01:31:27,883 --> 01:31:29,583
No.

864
01:32:10,603 --> 01:32:12,303
The spell works.

865
01:32:13,417 --> 01:32:15,172
We got a second chance.

866
01:33:54,057 --> 01:33:56,372
No!

867
01:34:05,935 --> 01:34:07,766
Wong!

868
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:17,601
I'm breaking the laws of nature, I know.

869
01:34:20,082 --> 01:34:21,782
Well, don't stop now.

870
01:34:23,141 --> 01:34:26,431
When the Sanctum is restored, they
will attack again. We have to defend it.

871
01:34:26,466 --> 01:34:28,850
Come on!

872
01:34:56,494 --> 01:34:59,658
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!

873
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:01,408
We will finish this.

874
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:04,200
You can't fight the inevitable.

875
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:09,370
Isn't it beautiful?

876
01:35:10,873 --> 01:35:12,928
A world beyond time.

877
01:35:15,898 --> 01:35:17,598
Beyond death.

878
01:35:21,409 --> 01:35:23,109
Beyond time...

879
01:35:23,366 --> 01:35:25,066
Strange!

880
01:35:56,776 --> 01:35:58,476
He's gone.

881
01:35:59,410 --> 01:36:02,333
Stephen Strange has left
to surrender to his power.

882
01:36:34,626 --> 01:36:37,447
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

883
01:36:37,482 --> 01:36:40,300
You've come to die.

884
01:36:40,335 --> 01:36:47,335
Your world is now my
world, like all worlds.

885
01:37:17,476 --> 01:37:20,441
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

886
01:37:21,103 --> 01:37:23,493
You've come to die.

887
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:27,468
Your world is now my world...

888
01:37:28,305 --> 01:37:30,005
What is this?

889
01:37:30,127 --> 01:37:34,393
Illusion? - No,
this is real. - Good.

890
01:37:44,855 --> 01:37:47,671
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

891
01:37:48,141 --> 01:37:50,985
You... what is happening?

892
01:37:51,701 --> 01:37:54,348
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension,

893
01:37:54,675 --> 01:37:56,796
I've brought a little power from mine.

894
01:37:57,455 --> 01:37:59,560
This is time.

895
01:38:00,126 --> 01:38:03,423
An endless loop of time.

896
01:38:03,936 --> 01:38:06,487
You dare!

897
01:38:09,761 --> 01:38:11,529
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

898
01:38:12,795 --> 01:38:15,064
You cannot do this forever.

899
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:17,156
Actually, I can.

900
01:38:17,278 --> 01:38:18,978
This is how things are now.

901
01:38:19,668 --> 01:38:23,831
You and me, trapped in
the moment, endlessly.

902
01:38:24,204 --> 01:38:27,420
Then you will spend eternity dying.

903
01:38:28,089 --> 01:38:31,653
Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live.

904
01:38:31,965 --> 01:38:33,665
But you will suffer.

905
01:38:33,854 --> 01:38:35,619
Pain is an old friend.

906
01:38:38,444 --> 01:38:40,144
Dormammu!

907
01:38:40,257 --> 01:38:42,880
I've come to bargain.
- End this!

908
01:38:43,023 --> 01:38:46,007
Dormammu!... Dormammu!... Dormammu!...

909
01:39:01,445 --> 01:39:04,100
You will never win.

910
01:39:05,661 --> 01:39:07,361
No...

911
01:39:07,585 --> 01:39:09,285
But I can lose.

912
01:39:09,786 --> 01:39:16,724
Again, and again, and
again, and again, forever.

913
01:39:18,396 --> 01:39:21,279
And that makes you my prisoner.
- No.

914
01:39:21,314 --> 01:39:25,756
Stop! Make this stop!

915
01:39:26,305 --> 01:39:29,744
Set me free!
- No.

916
01:39:30,634 --> 01:39:32,396
I've come to bargain.

917
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:36,956
Oh, what do you want?

918
01:39:38,194 --> 01:39:40,351
Take your zealots from the Earth.

919
01:39:40,912 --> 01:39:42,926
End your assault on my world.

920
01:39:43,462 --> 01:39:45,337
Never come back.

921
01:39:45,755 --> 01:39:48,834
Do it, and I'll break the loop.

922
01:39:58,545 --> 01:40:00,245
Get up, Strange.

923
01:40:00,263 --> 01:40:01,968
Get up and fight!

924
01:40:02,344 --> 01:40:04,093
We will finish this.

925
01:40:04,592 --> 01:40:06,292
Isn't it beautiful?

926
01:40:07,812 --> 01:40:09,859
A world beyond time.

927
01:40:12,623 --> 01:40:14,323
Beyond death.

928
01:40:26,284 --> 01:40:28,782
What have you done?
- I made a bargain.

929
01:40:32,528 --> 01:40:36,701
What is this?
- Well, it's, uh... it's everything you ever wanted.

930
01:40:38,027 --> 01:40:40,371
Eternal life as part of the One.

931
01:40:43,073 --> 01:40:45,033
You're not going to like it.

932
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,013
I think he really should
have stolen the whole book,

933
01:41:07,014 --> 01:41:08,714
because the warnings...

934
01:41:09,127 --> 01:41:11,794
the warnings come after the spells.

935
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:23,237
Oh, that's funny.

936
01:41:49,727 --> 01:41:51,427
We did it.

937
01:41:53,869 --> 01:41:55,569
Yes.

938
01:41:55,789 --> 01:41:57,489
Yes, we did it.

939
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:01,897
By also violating the natural laws.

940
01:42:02,709 --> 01:42:04,662
Look around you. It's over.

941
01:42:05,264 --> 01:42:08,101
You still think there will
be no consequences, Strange?

942
01:42:09,483 --> 01:42:11,240
No price to pay?

943
01:42:11,823 --> 01:42:14,845
We broke our rules, just like her.

944
01:42:15,757 --> 01:42:19,540
The bill comes due.

945
01:42:20,305 --> 01:42:22,005
Always.

946
01:42:22,234 --> 01:42:25,557
A reckoning.

947
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:29,512
I will follow this path no longer.

948
01:43:03,428 --> 01:43:05,128
Yeah, it's okay.

949
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:15,860
Wise choice.

950
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:20,165
You'll wear the eye of Agamotto
once you've mastered its powers.

951
01:43:20,725 --> 01:43:22,425
Until then,

952
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,037
best not to walk the streets
wearing an infinity stone.

953
01:43:26,316 --> 01:43:30,193
A what?
- You have a gift for the mystic arts, but you still have much to learn.

954
01:43:30,504 --> 01:43:32,287
ali me? ima? mnogo da? today.

955
01:43:33,427 --> 01:43:36,909
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the multiverse.

956
01:43:37,331 --> 01:43:40,240
The Earth has no Sorcerer
Supreme to defend it.

957
01:43:40,551 --> 01:43:42,721
We must be ready.
- We'll be ready.

958
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:33,828
So, Earth has wizards now, huh?

959
01:46:35,071 --> 01:46:38,380
Tea?
- I don't drink tea.

960
01:46:38,391 --> 01:46:40,091
What do you drink?

961
01:46:40,296 --> 01:46:42,490
Not tea.

962
01:46:45,495 --> 01:46:48,079
So, I keep a watchlist
of individuals and beings

963
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:50,648
from other realms that may
be a threat to this world.

964
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:54,243
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

965
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,265
A worthy inclusion.
- Yeah.

966
01:47:00,457 --> 01:47:04,300
So, why bring him here to New York?

967
01:47:04,330 --> 01:47:08,304
That's a long story. A family
drama, that kind of thing,

968
01:47:08,305 --> 01:47:10,538
but... we're looking for my father.

969
01:47:10,846 --> 01:47:17,221
Oh, okay. So, if you've found Odin,
you all will return to Asgard, probably?

970
01:47:17,265 --> 01:47:20,447
Oh, yes. Probably.
- Alright.

971
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:23,330
Let me help you.
