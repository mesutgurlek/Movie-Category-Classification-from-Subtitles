1
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,895
Talon 1 requesting Bitching Betty
relay Combat Control commands.

2
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,502
<i>Roger, Talon 1.</i>

3
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,103
<i>Central Prime is transmitting...</i>

4
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,672
<i>...encrypted satellite
auto-terrain comparison.</i>

5
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,536
Talons, this is Operator.

6
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,007
PAYCOM has given
his final tasking orders.

7
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:23,471
You are to proceed to target
and prosecute with precision.

8
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,175
Now, remember,
you are pilots of the U.S. Navy.

9
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,515
I expect nothing less
than perfection.

10
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,380
Roger, skipper.
Activating tactical music.

11
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,426
Countermeasure is silent party.
Talon 2, confirm.

12
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,320
Talon 2 confirms. Music on.

13
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,692
Risk assessment is
we have a clean mission status.

14
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,299
Attack commencing.

15
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,712
Gotcha.

16
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,619
<i>Missile lock. Missile lock.</i>

17
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,386
Talon 3, there's a SAM site on
the west wall. We got birds in the air.

18
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,036
Talon 2,
the SAM site's been erased.

19
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,307
Now, that's how you do it.

20
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,865
Talon 3, that was shit-hot!

21
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,868
Talon 1, I expect
the same out of you.

22
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,891
Arming Blue Ferret
for penetration detonation.

23
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,397
<i>Missile armed. Missile armed.</i>

24
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,302
Yep, 100 over 100.
That's correct.

25
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,574
And I can rely on these numbers?

26
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:10,273
<i>Well, this isn't figure skating, Ray.
You either score or you don't.</i>

27
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,418
<i>National Command Authority's
duly impressed.</i>

28
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,644
They've given us the go-ahead
on phase two.

29
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,083
<i>You know what?</i>

30
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,817
You should come to D.C. and make
the presentation to the senators.

31
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,692
That's how Admiral Rickover
got things done.

32
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,830
Admiral. You get my meaning?

33
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,899
No, I'm flattered,
but you do the lobbying.

34
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,659
Politics is for politicians.

35
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,703
- Captain?
- I'll get back to you.

36
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,199
There's Popsicles in the cooler.

37
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,843
- Got any grape?
- Any grape?

38
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,272
I believe there is one left,
and don't lose your dignity.

39
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,779
Oh, thank you.

40
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,277
- All right, take a seat.
- Nice catch.

41
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,980
Talk to me. Where are the holes?
How can we improve?

42
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,022
Come on. I'm not a patient man.

43
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,059
Sorry, I got caught up on
that west wall. I had to pull out...

44
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,561
War is a team sport.

45
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:02,064
Those AAA sites were thick.
Gave extra time to the SAM sites.

46
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,204
See, that's your answer. There really
was no room for improvement.

47
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,703
Actually, what Lieutenant Wade
did was right.

48
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,775
She took out their communications
and exposed their SAM sites...

49
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,138
...so Henry could lay it down.
- That's what I do.

50
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,077
- I mean, it was perfect.
- "Perfect. " I'll go along with that.

51
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,015
Much as I hate to see that smile
of yours get any smugger.

52
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,851
You blushing?

53
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,890
I've got good news.

54
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,322
Tell us we got a carrier,
skipper, come on.

55
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,551
Affirmative.

56
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,525
<i>The USS Abraham Lincoln.</i>

57
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,564
Captain's an old classmate of mine,
Dick Marshfield.

58
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,066
- I believe you two know each other.
- He was the captain I told you about.

59
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,763
- Hell of a pilot in his day.
- He's black too. He's black.

60
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,704
I'm also gonna be expanding
your squadron.

61
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,204
On the carrier, you'll be joined
by a new wingman.

62
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,173
A fourth wingman?

63
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,808
Wait, I thought there were only
three Talons in existence.

64
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,422
What is the problem, Purcell?
You look like you been hit in the gut.

65
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,957
For one, captain, we've been flying
together for a long time and it's good.

66
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,458
And four is an unlucky number.

67
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,654
- Unlucky?
- It's not a prime number.

68
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,232
Prime numbers can only be divided
by one or itself.

69
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,891
Three is prime. The Holy Trinity.

70
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,731
Thesis and antithesis come together
and form the synthesis...

71
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,705
This is not a seminar on metaphysics.
This is the U.S. Navy.

72
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:21,643
Now, we ship out Wednesday at 0500.
Dismissed.

73
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,146
Okay. If he'd let me finish,
I was gonna say...

74
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:28,117
<i>...Three's Company, Three Stooges,
Three Musketeers, three-peat...</i>

75
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,619
..."three strikes, you're out,"
"Three Times a Lady. "

76
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,382
- Three dimensions.
- Three blind mice.

77
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,220
<i>There's ménage à trois.
Don't forget that one.</i>

78
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,487
To the original three.

79
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,326
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

80
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,765
- Cheers.
- And assorted guests.

81
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,096
Cheers.

82
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,883
I'll be back in a second.

83
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,486
I gotta go pee-pee.

84
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,655
That's nasty.

85
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,796
At least she's potty-trained.
I'll give her that.

86
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,528
- Chip O'Dell.
- No way.

87
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,937
Yeah, it's gotta be him. Hey, Henry,
our fourth wing. It's gotta be him.

88
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,204
He tried to manipulate his way into
the program, but you two beat him.

89
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,907
Yeah, but Becky Martinez
could fly circles around O'Dell.

90
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,916
- Two out of the four are women? No.
- Hey, you never know.

91
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,385
- God, you're such a chauvinist.
- Hold on, now, that's not true.

92
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:41,857
I bow down before the superiority
of the opposite sex in many respects.

93
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,323
But from time to time...

94
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,530
...I believe they should
bow down before me.

95
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,997
- Oh, please.
- Kara. Kara, listen. You're different.

96
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,261
- You are a singularity.
- Absolutely.

97
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,200
You're a freak. Of nature.

98
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,364
- Well, thank you, Henry, I think.
- You are very welcome.

99
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,809
You know what I think?

100
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,272
Don't think. Drink.

101
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,717
<i>Have fun.</i>

102
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,711
Spectacular night, huh?

103
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,845
- Dark and mysterious, sir.
- Don't you like surprises, Ben?

104
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,887
Well, here he comes now.

105
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,275
Meet your new wingman.

106
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,761
Allow me to introduce the future
of digital warfare. Tim?

107
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,841
Open for Tim, please.

108
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,911
Fuel, catalyzed A1 methane.

109
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,747
Exoskeleton,
metal-ceramic composite.

110
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,185
Aeroelastic wings.

111
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,987
Pulse detonation engine
with twin hybrid scramjet turbos.

112
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,757
EDI's sensors can pick out
a face five miles away.

113
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:43,800
So we'll take three. Drop the top
on mine, personalized license plate.

114
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,096
So this is one of these
smart UCAVs.

115
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,605
Well, technically you could call it
an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle.

116
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,175
But that would be like
calling this carrier a rowboat.

117
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,471
I feel you, captain.
I know a bit about this.

118
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,139
- This is quantum processing, right?
- Yeah, it's the first tested application.

119
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,614
Ten terabits a second.

120
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,345
So if it's a UCAV,
why does it have a seat?

121
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,614
The cockpit's just
for testing and maintenance.

122
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,985
Otherwise, EDI flies all by himself.

123
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,724
You mean "itself," don't you, sir?

124
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,854
So this is what the fuss is all about.

125
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,461
You're looking
at VLO stealth, captain.

126
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,604
It's got a brain
like a quantum sponge.

127
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:23,572
And one day, its survivability
is going to fly right off the charts.

128
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,177
- Lieutenant Wade.
- It's good to meet you, sir.

129
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,573
It is a bag of chips, all right.

130
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,817
- Lieutenant Purcell.
- Honored to meet you, sir.

131
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,113
It will replace us all.

132
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,487
Looks and sounds
like science fiction, George.

133
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,751
Well, so did everything,
once upon a time.

134
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,827
Ain't that the truth.

135
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,255
Mr. Gannon.
Good to have you back.

136
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,663
Your first squadron tour still holds
some of the ship's most...

137
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,531
...impressive records.

138
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,503
Thank you, Captain Marshfield.
Records are made to be broken.

139
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,370
Rules too, if I remember
your philosophy.

140
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,274
Captain Cummings,
this is my X O, Mr. Carlson.

141
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,709
Carlson.

142
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,817
Why don't you meet me up on
the flight deck after you're through.

143
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,577
- You bet.
- Congratulations, George.

144
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,017
- Thank you.
- Good to see you again, Dick.

145
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,383
You too.

146
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,253
- It's humming.
- No, EDI's thinking.

147
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,862
- Thinking? Thinking about what, sir?
- You. All of you.

148
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,761
He's going over your files.
He's reviewing all your flight logs.

149
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,925
Let's take it for a spin,
see what it can do.

150
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,900
No, no, no. Tomorrow.

151
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,835
- First, you gotta do your homework.
- Homework?

152
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,044
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

153
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,009
"EDI UCAV. Extreme Deep Invader. "

154
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,444
Yeah, I've been called that
a few times.

155
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,178
- I've heard that one.
- Yeah, right.

156
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,101
Well, hello, gorgeous.

157
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,089
Please, no pictures, please.
No pictures, please. Please.

158
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,756
Okay, take them.
Take them. Take them.

159
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,709
It's open.

160
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,974
Study break.

161
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,748
You are one big study break.

162
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,282
Just a natural.

163
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,811
So that is the appeal.

164
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,422
Okay, because I was really
wondering how you manage...

165
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,184
...to pull a rocket scientist
at every port.

166
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,593
You better be careful, Ben, you know.
Hair bleach causes cancer in rats.

167
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,629
Well, I'm not a rat.
That's my appeal.

168
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,468
- You checking out the drone?
- Yeah.

169
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,004
Just barely skimmed the surface.

170
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,872
- We really are in the era of EDI.
- EDI.

171
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,205
Did I ever tell you
about that foster mother I had?

172
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,441
- The one who weighed 350 pounds?
- No.

173
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,553
Anyway, one day she comes home
with this Chihuahua, right?

174
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,951
Guess what she named him. Eddie.

175
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,355
- You know what I realized about you?
- What?

176
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,825
You got a foster mom
for every situation.

177
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,863
Hey, I lived through my childhood.
I may as well use it, right?

178
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,591
That's right.

179
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,570
So tell me, you think
Marshfield's right?

180
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,301
You think they're gonna trade us all in
for that machine?

181
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:49,277
No way. War is about tools.
Think about it.

182
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,348
Claws to clubs, bronze to steel.

183
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,543
- Best guy with the best weapon wins.
- Or girl.

184
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,348
And we all know who that is,
don't we?

185
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,853
The dull thud
of a Ben Gannon compliment.

186
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,635
Well...

187
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,206
Oh, pardon my C cup.

188
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,439
Study break is over.

189
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,494
<i>Good morning to the crew
of the USS Abraham Lincoln.</i>

190
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,097
<i>Remember, foreign-object debris
can ruin a jet engine.</i>

191
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,927
<i>Let's keep our safety record.
Scour that deck.</i>

192
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:47,095
Hey. Feel like we got older, Dick.
What the hell happened?

193
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,172
Don't complain.
You still got your hair.

194
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,673
Yeah. Some of it.

195
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,840
Look, truth be told...

196
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,282
...I never wanted this little experiment
of yours on my ship.

197
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,147
Well, you're not
hurting my feelings, Dick.

198
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,587
Admiral Spelling shared
your point paper with me...

199
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,852
...and your objections
were duly noted.

200
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,124
- You always could work the politics.
- It's indispensable in a bureaucracy.

201
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,028
This isn't a bureaucracy,
not out here.

202
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,431
You rush a weapons system
into service...

203
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,438
...you shortcut an operational
test cycle, people might get killed.

204
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,476
You know I can't pick my nose here
without 7000 people approving it.

205
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,442
Nobody rushed a damn thing.

206
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,248
Program is just ahead of schedule.

207
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,783
You missed this.

208
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,117
I'm out first, boys.

209
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,158
I'm right on that ass.

210
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,223
After you, ladies.

211
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,292
Talon 2, airborne.

212
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,598
Talon 3, airborne.

213
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,777
<i>Talon 1 is off and heading 2-5-4.</i>

214
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,040
Deploying Unmanned Combat
Aerial Vehicle...

215
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,843
...Extreme Deep Invader now.

216
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,058
I never thought
we would see this day.

217
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,789
Me neither, sir.

218
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,816
UCAV EDI, you have launch.

219
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,945
One to UCAV.
Confirm flight link. Over.

220
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,421
<i>Flight link confirmed, Talon 1.</i>

221
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,287
<i>It is good to be
part of the squadron.</i>

222
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,088
What? Well, well, well. He can talk.

223
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,926
Big deal. I know a guy's BMW,
does exactly the same thing.

224
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,643
Picture, please.

225
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,413
Aye, aye, sir.

226
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,582
Swarm logic activated.

227
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,952
All right, Ben.
EDI's here to learn from you.

228
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,392
So let's make sure these lessons
are up to speed, all right?

229
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,628
Well, then, let the schooling begin.

230
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,307
Captain Cummings.

231
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,650
Inside, please.

232
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,077
- What's the deal?
- You, sir, have a new tasking order.

233
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,959
One to wing, anybody got a visual
on the UCAV?

234
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,788
- Negative, 1.
- Negative, 1.

235
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,455
We better find him and regroup.

236
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,693
Before it takes a crap
in its quantum pants.

237
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,097
Wait up. Hold on.

238
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,401
What the hell is he doing?

239
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,939
Here he comes. Here he comes.

240
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,873
I think little brother
is messing with us.

241
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,348
UCAV, your position is always
on my starboard side.

242
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,883
Other starboard.

243
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,391
That's hot.

244
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,257
Got no heart, but it sure can fly.
That's not bad for a tin man.

245
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:48,338
EDI, it's official. You got a call sign.
UCAV "Tin Man" EDI, the first.

246
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,708
<i>- Operator to squadron.
- Go for Talons.</i>

247
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,045
There's been a change of plans.

248
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,484
We're giving you an emergency
mission redirect. Repeat.

249
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,954
That's an emergency redirect.
Do you read me?

250
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,683
<i>Roger. Where's the fire, skipper?</i>

251
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,988
PAYCOM has given us
a brand-new tasking order.

252
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,995
Please access your encrypted file...

253
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,294
...named "Advanced
War Vector Scenarios. "

254
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,936
<i>File's open. Go ahead.</i>

255
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,939
All right. Firewall code
is "Terror Summit. "

256
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:28,773
We are upgrading this file from
a scenario to a tactical action plan.

257
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,642
Repeat, we are upgrading the file.

258
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:36,415
CIA human intel has just learned
that the heads of three terrorist cells...

259
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,682
<i>...are about to meet in 24 minutes.</i>

260
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,623
<i>The country is Myanmar.
The city is Rangoon.</i>

261
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,025
<i>They're planning an imminent attack
on U.S. soil.</i>

262
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,590
One to Control,
what about the UCAV?

263
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,868
EDI will observe your attack.

264
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,264
Proceed to primary.

265
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,570
<i>Roger.</i>

266
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,840
<i>One to UCA V,
confirm observation status only.</i>

267
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,051
<i>Tin Man confirms, Talon 1.</i>

268
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,914
<i>New coordinates
have been uploaded.</i>

269
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,751
Baptism by fire, Tin Man.

270
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,602
<i>Mach 1.</i>

271
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,505
<i>Mach 2.</i>

272
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,501
<i>Mach 3.</i>

273
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,442
<i>Mach 4.</i>

274
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:43,246
<i>Primo's now analyzing the location.
Here we go.</i>

275
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,724
The primary is this building.

276
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,294
A new defense ministry
still under construction.

277
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,922
Specs indicate
14-foot-thick cement roof...

278
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,261
...with steel reinforcements.

279
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,768
Roger. We're not weaponized
for something that thick.

280
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,428
Repeat, not weaponized.

281
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,131
This is 2. What's the population
of the collateral area?

282
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,308
The building's unoccupied, but it's
in the middle of downtown Rangoon.

283
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,313
This is 3.
Talk to me about that roof.

284
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,611
What's Primo advocate
to ordinance and influence?

285
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,617
Primo says Talons
can't penetrate it.

286
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,656
This is our chance. We may never
catch these bastards together again.

287
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,851
Try a lateral vector.

288
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,627
Just do what he says.

289
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,062
<i>This is 2 to Control.
Risk assessment officer advises...</i>

290
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,568
...casualties from lateral vector
will be in the thousands.

291
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,407
<i>Tin Man has integrated
all network-centric spy satellites.</i>

292
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,941
<i>Here is new data.</i>

293
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:17,979
UCAV is bypassing Central Prime.
He's distributing secure video stream.

294
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,985
Look at that. Oh, yeah. Oh, now
I know what I want for Christmas.

295
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,279
One to Control, we've entered
our mission window.

296
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,319
<i>Six-three seconds
to primary and counting.</i>

297
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,321
Come on, Control,
we have our targets.

298
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:04,826
Come on. I need an alternative.
We got these guys in the bull's-eye.

299
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,760
<i>There is an alternative,
Combat Control.</i>

300
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,701
Operator to UCAV. Talk to me.
Give me something.

301
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,432
<i>Squadron carries
truncheon implosion bombs.</i>

302
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,800
Negative, will not work.

303
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,845
Central Prime says truncheons
can't achieve velocity for penetration.

304
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,575
One to UCAV, 37 seconds to primary.
Come on, explain.

305
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,812
<i>Diving dead vertical at 2070 knots
will increase truncheon velocity.</i>

306
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,253
<i>Bomb will successfully
penetrate roof.</i>

307
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,620
What's the blackout risk
at vertical 2070?

308
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:39,423
<i>- Seventy-three percent.
- Time on target is 23 seconds.</i>

309
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,931
- Call it off. It's not worth the risk.
- Operator to Talons, pull back.

310
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,932
- EDI will plant the truncheon.
- Captain.

311
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,401
This is what we built
this machine for.

312
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:51,338
There's no blood in those
quantum veins. It can't black out.

313
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:55,878
Operator to Talons, repeat,
EDI will plant the truncheon.

314
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,483
Control, negative, Control.
Mission critical. One will prosecute.

315
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,209
This is 3 to 1. I got your back...

316
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,684
...but if you black out,
you're gonna kill everyone.

317
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:07,347
Negative, 3. I did not get this far
by being in the 73rd percentile.

318
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,191
I like my odds.

319
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,353
<i>Talon 1, your orders
are to stand down.</i>

320
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,464
<i>- Do you read me, lieutenant?
- I do...</i>

321
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,529
<i>- Talon 1, stand down.
- I'm having...</i>

322
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,136
Can you...? Can you...?

323
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,640
Go, baby, go.

324
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,656
<i>One hundred knots
to release velocity.</i>

325
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,526
<i>Fifty knots to release velocity.</i>

326
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,367
His BP is spiking, sir.

327
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,312
<i>Release velocity attained.</i>

328
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,881
Truncheon away.

329
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,100
<i>Ten seconds to implosion.</i>

330
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,033
<i>Nine, eight...</i>

331
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,697
<i>...seven, six...</i>

332
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:08,879
<i>...five, four, three...</i>

333
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,675
<i>...two, one.</i>

334
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:42,536
This is 1 to Control. Looks like we
lost radio contact for a second there.

335
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:46,081
There you go. I wasn't worried, baby.
I wasn't worried.

336
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,652
Activating swarm logic,
going full-stealth egress.

337
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,490
Roger, Talon 1. Full-stealth egress.
Swarm logic is on.

338
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,518
Battle damage assessment,
100 over 100.

339
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:59,288
Collateral damage, zero.

340
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,601
Let's go home.

341
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,903
Going hypersonic.

342
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,419
Same old Ben.

343
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,720
Yep.

344
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,019
Oh, and, George...

345
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,885
...hell of a first mission.

346
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,825
Thank you, captain.

347
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,030
On my way to the bridge.

348
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,674
<i>Talon 2 and 3 are on deck.</i>

349
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,278
Talon 1 and UCAV EDI
are on approach.

350
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,609
Roger, Control. UCAV will go first.
I'll take the last trap.

351
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,511
UCAV, confirm you've got the ball.

352
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,079
<i>Confirmed, Talon 1.
Tin Man will land next.</i>

353
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,572
Okay, 1 to Control,
we've had a lightning strike.

354
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,675
The UCAV's very unstable.

355
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,970
Landing sequence is altered.
I'll go in first...

356
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,636
...but the UCAV
is gonna need the net.

357
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,559
Nice landing, ma'am.

358
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,290
<i>On the flight deck,
stand by to rig barricade.</i>

359
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,268
<i>Extreme Deep Invader aircraft
inbound for crash landing.</i>

360
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,210
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

361
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,448
- Hold on! Stop! Stop.
- Stay low, stay low! Pull low!

362
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,329
Pull starboard! Pull starboard!

363
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,779
Clear the deck!

364
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,009
Move it! Move it! Move it!

365
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,712
- You scared me.
- Sorry, just a bit restless.

366
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,986
Really got whacked tonight, right?
Like a hair dryer in a bathtub.

367
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,647
Oh, he can't hear you.
I pulled his voice recog.

368
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,887
I'll call it a "he" when it gets out of its
cockpit and takes a piss, how's that?

369
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,996
- You all right?
- Yeah.

370
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,861
It's just a power surge, that's all.

371
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,098
- And that's normal?
- Normal?

372
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,140
Let me show you something.

373
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,514
That was EDI's neural network.

374
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:48,048
Now, check this out.

375
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:54,759
I mean, ever since the lightning strike,
he's just been writing all of this...

376
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,400
I don't know. A language or a code.

377
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,627
And what does it mean?

378
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,733
Yeah. "Mean. "

379
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,306
The person that could really
answer that question...

380
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,966
...is its designer, Keith Orbit.
- Orbit?

381
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,478
- The guy's name is Orbit?
- Yeah, I know.

382
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,981
He did all the Al on the Raptor
when he was 22...

383
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:18,179
...and I guess, after that, he decided
that his given name was too earthly.

384
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,427
Off for Tim, please.

385
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,120
At least it's a good song.

386
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:32,596
He downloads songs from the Web.

387
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,396
Yeah? How many?

388
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,401
All of them.

389
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,249
You're in a peck of trouble
with the record companies there, son.

390
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,342
Ben, could...?

391
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:57,052
I saw how serious
that shit is up there.

392
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:02,325
So I think it's only fair that I tell you
that EDI's been designed to evolve.

393
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,266
- It's just unpredictable...
- Let me ask you something.

394
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:12,069
Just between you and me,
do you have confidence in this plane?

395
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,140
There's your answer.

396
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,742
It's open.

397
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,388
Have a seat.

398
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,616
"Waffle" for 15 points.
I'm kicking your ass, buddy.

399
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,590
You didn't cheat, did you?

400
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,753
Cheating's not part
of my vocabulary.

401
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,165
Listen, I scheduled your jet
for a little maintenance.

402
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,566
I gotta get the bugs out of that radio,
don't you think?

403
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,070
It was a difficult situation
and I made a decision.

404
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,799
You made a mistake, Ben.

405
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,376
Sir, there's a thin line
between insubordination and...

406
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,809
No, no, no,
that's not the mistake you made.

407
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,075
Your mistake was getting competitive
with a machine.

408
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,481
I'm the point of the sword
up there, sir.

409
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,848
And I pulled it off, 100 over 100.

410
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:01,958
Yes, indeedy, and I congratulate you.
Calls have been coming in all night.

411
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,720
But that doesn't change the issue.

412
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,158
What is the issue, then?

413
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,230
- Would you like a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

414
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,663
- You sure?
- Fine, thank you.

415
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,167
Rolled on the thighs
of mulatto women.

416
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,870
What are you afraid of, Ben?

417
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,341
Being replaced? Is that it?

418
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,503
You afraid EDI's
gonna take your job?

419
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,979
No. No, to be honest with you...

420
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,881
...I just don't think war should become
some kind of video game.

421
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,816
And how do you feel
about black body bags?

422
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,721
What am I supposed to tell
all the weeping mothers?

423
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,863
We could've got the job done
without sacrificing their children...

424
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,556
...but no, we decided not to
because of what?

425
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,462
- Tradition?
- Not tradition, it's...

426
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,627
Look, we have things
those computers can never have...

427
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,672
...like instincts and feelings
and moral judgment.

428
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,810
You can call me old-fashioned,
you can call it whatever you want...

429
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,071
...but I just don't think that in war...

430
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,546
...the action should ever be divorced
from the consequences.

431
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,742
You don't think I consider
the consequences...

432
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,615
...every time I send you up there
with bombs?

433
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,319
- I know you do, sir.
- I've dedicated my life...

434
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,049
...to considering the consequences.

435
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,757
I got a bad feeling about this plane.

436
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,496
I don't know, I think it needs more...

437
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:20,467
I don't know, trials before it's ever
put in a combat situation again.

438
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,230
You been talking to Marshfield?

439
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,668
- Sir, you're my commanding officer.
- That's right.

440
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:31,538
And I guarantee you this thing will be
100 percent before I risk it in the field.

441
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,650
Look, Ben...

442
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:37,777
...all we need is
one more successful mission...

443
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,981
...and this project will be out of
the stovepipe and into the light.

444
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,856
Are you with me on this?

445
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,054
- I'm here to make it happen, sir.
- All right.

446
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,792
I've arranged a little R and R for you
and your team. You've earned it.

447
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,196
Thailand maybe.

448
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,434
We just got here.

449
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,538
Yeah, but this could turn out
to be a long tour.

450
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:03,806
You better take it while you can get it.
We'll pick this up when you get back.

451
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,271
Hey, how you doing? Henry Purcell.

452
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:08,902
I'm from America. Look, I fly jets.
You like to go fast?

453
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,505
- B, it's the future and it works.
- I don't think it works.

454
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,147
It's just technology.

455
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,443
You know, it's here to make me safe.
It keeps me alive.

456
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:22,847
EDI is no different.

457
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,318
- You think it keeps you safe?
- Yeah. He's here...

458
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,354
...to help me get the job done...

459
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,322
...keep me in one piece...

460
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,427
...so I can visit my folks
for Thanksgiving.

461
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,360
Anyway, our safety's not the point.

462
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:37,968
War's meant to be terrible. If it stops
being terrible, what's gonna stop us?

463
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,763
It's become some kind of sport.
Just send in the EDls.

464
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,929
Yeah, but it's neutral.

465
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,473
- What?
- I mean, EDI...

466
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,170
...if it's controlled by moral people,
then it'll be moral.

467
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,141
Oh, I know I'm not moral.

468
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:54,773
As a matter of fact, I should be
arrested for the thoughts I have now.

469
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,284
I say something?

470
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:04,485
Well, you boys will have to excuse me.
I have to go pee-pee.

471
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,165
- Do you wanna go?
- Okay.

472
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,838
- What?
- You know what.

473
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,538
Take it easy. Nothing's happened.

474
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,776
No, something's happened.
You just ain't done anything about it.

475
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,055
Shit, man.

476
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,282
- I didn't want for this to happen.
- Come on.

477
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,790
I tried for it not to.
Navy's got rules about it...

478
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,862
...but it's like this force
and it's got ahold of me.

479
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,996
I love her.

480
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,158
B, you and I both know
that Kara Wade...

481
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,362
...is being groomed by the Navy.

482
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,029
She's a poster girl, you know?

483
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,871
She went to the right schools,
got the right background, connections.

484
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:57,343
If any woman is gonna rise to the top
of this business, it's gonna be her.

485
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,710
- I agree.
- And you're in a perfect position...

486
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,715
...to mess all that up.

487
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:05,720
So I hope that your love is powerful.

488
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,156
You have a beautiful country.

489
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,927
I mean, look at this.
This is paradise.

490
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,801
Know what I think? When I'm down
here, things look so much different.

491
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,032
As opposed to being up there.

492
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:30,010
Flying around, everything is so small,
everything goes by so fast.

493
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,478
And then they tell you...

494
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,341
They tell you to drop a bomb.

495
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,286
It's like you just erase something
they told you had to be erased.

496
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,092
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I got a job to do.

497
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:49,824
It's the flyest job you'll ever have,
but sometimes, right here...

498
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,969
Right here on earth, it's just...

499
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,669
It's just beautiful.

500
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,630
And you...

501
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:01,304
...don't understand a word I'm saying,
do you?

502
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:04,345
- No, I don't understand.
- You don't?

503
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,552
Well, you understand something.

504
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,122
Now, can you cook?

505
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:23,228
Wow. Beautiful.

506
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,334
- Now, do you guys have it so easy.
- Yeah? How's that?

507
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:34,206
- Henry meets a girl, like he does.
- Absolutely.

508
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:39,145
Leaves with her, sleeps with her,
and then what?

509
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:42,717
I mean, I don't know, what does
he do? Does he leave flowers?

510
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,985
He tells me he's religious
about that, yes.

511
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,452
Really?

512
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,685
And what do you do?
You leave flowers?

513
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,987
Me? No, I just leave.

514
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,727
What about you?

515
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,628
E- mails.

516
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,099
- The personal touch. Nice.
- Yeah, thanks.

517
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:08,971
Honestly, I just really haven't found
anyone that's worth the risk until now.

518
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:25,156
I'm going to head into town,
check out the local Thai nightlife.

519
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,593
Henry says it's great.

520
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,960
I don't think I'll find any
bleached blonds there, but...

521
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,104
Very true.

522
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,659
Oh, shit.

523
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:08,269
We got a nuclear crisis on
our hands, Ben. Here's the brief.

524
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,535
You're headed for Tajikistan.

525
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,200
One of those breakaway countries,
used to be part of the Soviet Union.

526
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:19,315
Seems some warlord has got his mitts
on three SS-42 Scud carcasses.

527
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:22,452
Joint Chiefs want them taken out,
and they want them out yesterday.

528
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,085
Mr. Wiatt, we good to go?

529
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,280
Yes, sir. Ready for combat.

530
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,721
Wait, you mean the UCAV
has been cleared for launch?

531
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,451
- Where's...?
- Tim?

532
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,790
- Tim, yeah.
- He's been reassigned.

533
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,364
Reassi...?

534
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,567
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Permission denied.

535
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,298
- We've already been through this.
- Scrub EDI from the mission.

536
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,568
I know you have a vision. I know
how much this project means to you...

537
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,805
...but this plane is putting
all of our lives at unnecessary risk.

538
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,549
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

539
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:57,278
EDI is the whole idea.

540
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,979
You understood this was new
territory when you signed on.

541
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,421
You wanted to be on the cutting edge?
This is it.

542
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:07,496
You will fly with EDI, or the next thing
you drive might just have a propeller.

543
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,497
Your choice, make it now.

544
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,314
<i>Operator to squadron.</i>

545
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,279
<i>We've just located
nuclear warheads...</i>

546
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,578
<i>...three miles north
of the Scud launchers.</i>

547
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,914
<i>These warheads
are now your primary.</i>

548
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,148
<i>Proceed to mission window.</i>

549
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,690
Sequenced assault will be
2, 3 and 1.

550
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,819
UCAV, you will hold here
and maintain altitude. Confirm?

551
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,900
UCAV, do you read me?

552
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,333
<i>Confirmed, Talon 1.</i>

553
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:50,962
Pick up the pace on confirmations,
Tin Man. Don't make me ask twice.

554
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,473
Talon flight, descend to 25,000.

555
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,408
Final attack heading 1-8-5.

556
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,357
Tell them to arm those FAEs,
and I mean right now.

557
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,588
Combat Control instructs arm
and deploy fuel-air explosives.

558
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:24,130
<i>Arm and deploy fuel-air explosives.</i>

559
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,929
Fuel-air, armed and deployed.

560
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,070
Fuel-air, external and armed.

561
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,172
Talon 2 to Operator.

562
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,973
I'm getting a contradictory
population-density read.

563
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:41,606
Sensors detect mammals warming.
Maybe 1000 medium weights.

564
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:44,913
Those could be people. Repeat.
Ground intel may be incorrect.

565
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,079
<i>Request to acknowledge
Dirty Mission status...</i>

566
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,282
<i>...and exercise
attack abort authority.</i>

567
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:54,487
Operator to Talons. Your orders
are to commence attack now.

568
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,463
<i>- Commence attack.
- Give me your estimate on collaterals.</i>

569
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,166
Maybe 500 to 1000.

570
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:02,567
Farmers, Ben. They're just farmers.

571
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,706
Radioactive dust is gonna rain
all over the place.

572
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:20,255
Okay, okay, now we got a problem.

573
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,415
This is 3.
Sensors read surface wind...

574
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,651
...as due south at 40 miles per.

575
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,729
At that rate, nuclear debris
will reach Pakistan by tomorrow.

576
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,727
<i>Commence attack.</i>

577
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,834
<i>Commence attack.</i>

578
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,239
<i>One to Control.
As commander in the field...</i>

579
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,637
<i>...I'm exercising
attack abort authority.</i>

580
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,937
<i>Reasons: Collateral, both at primary...</i>

581
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,808
<i>...and allied state of Pakistan,
will be too high.</i>

582
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,643
Son of a bitch.

583
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,978
Repeat, the order is to abort.

584
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,552
Yes, yes, what I'm talking about.

585
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,416
<i>Negative, Talon 1.
Tin Man will not abort.</i>

586
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,658
<i>Tin Man will prosecute.</i>

587
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:02,496
That's an abort, EDI.
Repeat, return to formation.

588
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,361
<i>Return to formation, EDI.
That's an order.</i>

589
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:22,146
Damn it. UCAV taking AAAs.
We gotta bail it out.

590
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,684
Come on, initiate scramjets.

591
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,880
I'm coming around. I'm gonna
take out those Scud launchers.

592
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,049
I got you covered on the west side.

593
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,195
And I got that Bofors gun
on the east parapet.

594
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:31,043
Let me see it, let me see it.

595
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:34,247
Battle damage assessment calculates
primary target, Scud warheads...

596
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,891
...completely suppressed.

597
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,323
That's the right answer so far.

598
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,187
Talon 2 to Operator.

599
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:11,521
Nuclear dust engulfing village
southeast of primary. Situation critical.

600
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:14,493
Those people are gonna need
emergency medical help now.

601
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,535
<i>Tin Man rejoining formation.</i>

602
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:29,039
<i>Mission achieved, 100 over 100.</i>

603
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,044
UCAV, you disobeyed
a direct order.

604
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,080
You put innocent civilians
in harm's way.

605
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,152
- You put our squadron at risk.
- Damn straight.

606
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,551
<i>Tin Man did what you did in Rangoon.
You taught me.</i>

607
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,851
Listen, you little shit.
When you fly with me...

608
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,256
...you do what I tell you,
when I tell you.

609
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:48,559
<i>You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?</i>

610
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,223
<i>EDI is the whole idea.</i>

611
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,371
<i>Selecting other targets.</i>

612
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,669
<i>Detaching formation.</i>

613
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,347
Yo, this is 3.
Did he say, "other targets"?

614
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:09,216
I got his missile inventory.
He's got two Throat-rippers...

615
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,684
...two Shock Hammers
and three Blue Ferrets.

616
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:16,485
If those targets are in the city,
he could kill 150,000 people with that.

617
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,094
Holy shit.

618
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,692
Sir.

619
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,629
He's closing his data link.

620
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,996
Primo says he's just firewalled
his transponder...

621
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,468
...which is definitely
not supposed to be possible.

622
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,238
He's gone.

623
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:36,475
Talon 1.

624
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,773
<i>Go for Talons.</i>

625
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,874
I want my plane back, Ben.

626
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,020
I want it back in one piece.
You understand?

627
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:46,280
<i>- Roger, captain.
- And, you...</i>

628
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:48,651
...get me Keith Orbit on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

629
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:51,487
<i>I wanna head back north
and do a triangulated sweep.</i>

630
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,624
Going hypersonic.

631
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,473
We're talking about
creating intention here.

632
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,406
Yeah. Really lends itself
to quantum processing.

633
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,412
- Different. A straight line.
- Keith.

634
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,846
Z is... Interesting.

635
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:18,146
Keith, it's an emergency.
It's George Cummings.

636
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,651
One moment for Dr. Orbit, please.

637
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,316
Good luck.

638
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:28,391
George. Never got that invitation
to the White House.

639
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,461
<i>Knock it off, wiseass.</i>

640
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:34,092
Look, we have big problems out here
with the UCAV.

641
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,966
It's gone completely haywire.

642
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:39,165
Anything more technically specific
than "haywire," George?

643
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,778
It's disobeyed direct orders,
bombed a target off the map...

644
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,174
<i>...with collateral damage.</i>

645
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:48,714
<i>He separated himself from Primo.
He's flying around in foreign airspace.</i>

646
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,082
<i>- Where'd all this happen?
- That's not your concern.</i>

647
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:55,884
Now, you created him. You get him
back here and under control!

648
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,863
Captain.

649
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,335
What in the hell's going on in here?

650
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,232
We're on it, Dick. Settle down.

651
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,741
Pacific Command says
there are planes from my ship...

652
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,503
...all over the Tajikistan border.

653
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,911
The Russians have picked up
the activity and are getting nervous.

654
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,313
We're gonna get out
before there's a problem.

655
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,215
You have planes
headed towards Russia!

656
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,913
Now, you better have
a hell of a good explanation.

657
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:33,586
Look, this is a technical delay,
not a national-security crisis.

658
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:37,563
Now, if you excuse me,
I got pilots at risk.

659
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,725
Damn right you do.

660
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,215
This is 3. I got a visual.

661
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,511
Way to go, EZ.
Give me your relative bearing.

662
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,483
<i>North of my position,
at 50,000 feet...</i>

663
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,714
<i>...headed toward
the Russian no-fly zone.</i>

664
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:03,256
Stay with him. We have your position.
On our way.

665
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:05,951
I am 86 seconds on your tail.
Be there in a flash.

666
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:09,724
Hold off on engaging. Let me get
clarification. Be there in two minutes.

667
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:12,094
Don't make me wait.
One is a lucky prime number...

668
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:16,261
...but three is sounding much luckier.
Oh, shit, he's making a move.

669
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:33,320
Talon 1 to Operator. We are on
secure line Alpha. Found our target.

670
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,319
<i>Please advise.</i>

671
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,654
Just get him back to base.

672
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,067
Henry, stay with him.
Try and talk him down.

673
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,066
I'm on that ass.

674
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:52,732
<i>Talon 3, state your intentions.</i>

675
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,276
My intentions are to reason with you,
EDI. All right? You're messing up.

676
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,641
You're the future.
You're not allowed to act this way.

677
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,511
<i>I am designed to destroy the enemy.
Just like you.</i>

678
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,676
And like me, you got orders.
Now your orders are to return to base.

679
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,253
Good pilots follow orders.

680
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,152
<i>Negative.</i>

681
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:12,253
You're not gonna disrespect me.
You're not gonna disrespect me.

682
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,101
You're really making me
look bad, Tin Man.

683
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,830
I was the only one to defend you.

684
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:28,000
Now, let's go on home and quit flying
around like this. This is crazy.

685
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,379
<i>Talon 3, leave me alone.</i>

686
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,784
Leave you alone?
I'm trying to help you.

687
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,989
I'm right behind you, 3.
Got your back.

688
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:54,460
Talon 1 to Operator.
Talons 2 and 3 are flying at high risk.

689
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,003
Request permission
to destroy the UCAV.

690
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:06,409
I don't wanna hurt you or see billions
of taxpayers' dollars scattered all over.

691
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:10,485
But if you make me, I will blast your
aeroelastic ass right out the sky.

692
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,679
<i>Your chances are less than
1 percent.</i>

693
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:17,587
Come on. Come on, Operator.

694
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,252
Give me permission to kill it,
or I will make the decision myself.

695
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:23,092
<i>Control, please respond.</i>

696
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:26,901
<i>Sir, you leave me no choice.</i>

697
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,698
Okay, Henry. Weapons hot.
Weapons hot. Destroy the target.

698
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,868
I got my orders now, playboy.

699
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,574
Henry, you're too close.
You're too close.

700
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,177
Drop back! Drop back!

701
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:50,359
<i>Missile lock, on.</i>

702
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,926
Goodbye, EDI.

703
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:55,462
Henry, drop back!
You gotta drop back!

704
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,969
<i>Goodbye, Henry.</i>
