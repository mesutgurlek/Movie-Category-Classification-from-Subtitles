Auntie, do you have a first aid kit?

00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:13,743
Where are you going?

176
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,078
[whispering] Okay.

Who are you signaling?

179
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:29,342
Doctor Merch.

180
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:32,979
And what's left of the
Mount Wilson CDC lab.

181
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:52,109
- He's losing a lot of blood.
- [whispering] Can you do anything?

182
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:54,078
Way out of my league. Sorry, kid.

183
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:55,780
Maybe the submarine has a surgeon.

184
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:57,615
They're bound to have a sick bay.

185
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,583
What's the deal with this submarine anyway?

186
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:02,670
Is that where Doctor Merch has
been hiding this whole time?

187
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:05,422
Sorry hon. That's classified.

188
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:08,926
Classified? From who? The zombies?

189
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,859
Say goodbye, pup.

190

191
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:12,823
All right. Doc, you stay with 10K.

192
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:15,025
Vasquez and Addy, you guys cover us.

193

Dearie, put your guns away.

194
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,113
They have a nuclear submarine.

195

No.

Cap'n.

201

Auntie. Looks like you had a busy morning.

202
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:41,635
We had a bit of a lunch rush.

203

That's not him, is it?

204
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:45,356
No, sir.

205
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,894
Lieutenant Roberta Warren.
Missouri National Guard.

206
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:51,562
We have the package here.

207
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:53,063
Safe.

208
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,450
So, you're The Murphy?

209
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:58,202
Actually it's just Murphy.

210

<i>I don't know where this
whole the came from.</i>

211
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,239
We have a wounded man.

212
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,576
I'm the ship's doctor.
Let me take a look at him.

213
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:08,128
Lot of people been looking
for you, Mr. Murphy.

214
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:10,164
Well you found me.

215
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:11,916
Now what?

216
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:15,920
First we have to make sure
you are who you say you are.

217
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,221
Oh.

218
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:19,673
I am.

219
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:22,259
<i>How do we know you are who you say you are?</i>

220
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:24,845
I understand your
reluctance, Lieutenant Warren.

221
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:28,349
We've been tracking
Delta-Xray-Delta for two years.

222
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,567
If I'd been through
what you'd been through,

223
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:34,188
I'd make damn sure I was giving
that package to the right person

224
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,939
too.

225
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:37,775
Doctor, would you mind joining us?

226
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,449
Is that him?

227
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:47,501
I don't know.

228
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,919
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:52,923
I only saw him for a minute
before we were evacuated.

230
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,291
Everything was so chaotic, there was

231
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:56,427
Perhaps this'll jog your memory.

232
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:57,127
Pike me.

233
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,595
Pike me!

234
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:01,799
Or I will hunt you down
and eat your brains!

235
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:04,969
That's him.

236
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:06,470
Satisfied?

237
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,638
Very.

238
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:11,275
Now let's get you back to the sub.

239
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,727
We got a lot of work to do.

240
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:17,481
What happened to your Delta Force Escort,

241
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:18,282
Lieutenant Hammond?

242
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,234
He didn't make it.

243
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:22,786
A lot of people didn't make it.

244
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:25,039
Easy, easy.

245
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,088
Hey.

246
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,675
It's okay.

247
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:47,895
I need your word

248
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:51,982
that he will be treated
humanely. He may be The Murphy.

249
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:53,350
But he still is a human being.

250
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:55,102
You have my word, Lieutenant Warren.

251
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:57,938
We'll treat him like the
celebrity he's about to become.

252
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:01,942
[laughing] Celebrity? You hear that?

253
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:07,197
I'm about to become the first
post-apocalyptic reality star.

Yay me.

255

Well don't forget the little people.

256
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:13,370
It's gonna be okay, kid.
They got a real surgeon.

257
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,705
They're gonna fix you up.

258
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:16,090
I'm his physician. I'm
gonna need to go with you.

259
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,591
Sorry, sir. We barely
have room for these two.

260
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,842
But I, I have to be

Don't worry.

262

We'll take good care of him.

That's it? No goodbye? Nothing?

A handshake? After all the
shit we've been through?

I got something for you too, brother.

In case you get seasick.

273

Thank you, brother.

341
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:43,608
how far Im gonna be able
to chuck the damn crowbar.

342
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,442
I'm out.

343
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:47,745
And without range, this
cover won't do us much good.

344
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,248
Well if you just ask nicely

345
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,418
Well aren't you full of surprises.

346
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,871
Well I'm a little low on ammo.

347
00:19:57,006 --> 00:20:00,374
But I think we can give
them hell in the meantime.

348
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:05,346
All right. Let's rock and roll.

349
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:09,267
The fact that they haven't
started beating down these doors

350
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:12,637
yet worries me more than
if they just kept attacking.

351
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:15,857
Mindless mayhem we can handle.

352
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:18,226
Whatever the hell they're planning,

353
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:20,561
I'm not so sure.

354
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:42,466
Young male. Single large caliber
gunshot wound to the abdomen.

355
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:45,887
Pulse weak, irregular.
He's lost a lot of blood.

356
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:49,974
Is he gonna be okay?

357
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,393
They'll do everything they
can. Now we need to leave.

358
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:54,979
We'll make sure to get him back
to his friends in one piece.

359
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:56,230
Your man's in good hands.

360
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:59,150
He's not my man. He's just
a byproduct of the apocalypse

361
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:00,735
I couldn't seem to shake.

362
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,819
Follow me.

363
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:07,491
<i>We've been waiting for you
a long time, Mr. Murphy.</i>

364
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,077
Yeah, well I got a little sidetracked.

365
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:12,163
Have there been any side
effects from the vaccine?

366
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:15,666
Side effects? Lady, I am a
giant walking side effect.

367
00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:17,168
Any cravings?

368
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:18,703
You mean for brains?

369
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:20,121
No.

370
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,461
Who are you working for?

371
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:30,131
I thought the U.S. Government
collapsed years ago.

372
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:31,132
It did.

373
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:34,435
The whole idea of a nation
state is a thing of the past.

374
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:37,855
A new world is rising
from the ashes of the old.

375
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:39,473
A better world.

376
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,808
Zona.

377
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:42,526
Zona?

378
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:44,562
I've heard of that.

379
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:48,316
This crazy pilot in Roswell.
He was gonna fly some

380
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:50,067
experimental aircraft back to Zona.

381
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,719
We thought he was nuts.

382
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:52,637
Zona's real?

383
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:56,224
Zona is more than just
real. It's the future.

384
00:21:56,609 --> 00:22:00,311
Early in the apocalypse, a
group of visionary world leaders

385
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:04,065
and businessmen embarked
on a plan to save humanity.

386
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,817
Together they created a zombie free island

387
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:10,037
where the seeds of the next
human race have been planted.

388
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:12,707
What about the old human race?

389
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:14,325
Time may be running out.

390
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:17,378
The pilot you met was part of a larger plan

391
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:20,047
to recover advanced technology
and cultural heritage

392
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,499
before it's lost forever.

393
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,835
Unfortunately, both
tend to be very fragile.

394
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:29,140
We're in a race against time to
hold onto what makes us human.

395
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:30,508
[clank]

396
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:39,183
Sorry.

397
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:40,151
My bad.

398
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,105
So if we are going to save the human race,

399
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,740
maybe we better get started.

400
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:50,861
Anybody tries to come in that front door

401
00:22:50,863 --> 00:22:53,781
is stepping right into our kill box.

402

<i>Cubrirse! Cubrirse!</i>

403
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,920
Now what are they up to?

404
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:07,928
Hey, Roberta!

405
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:09,096
Hey!

406
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:12,717
It's not you I came
after. Just Murphy. Hmmm?

407
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:15,436
I only want Murphy!

408
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:19,473
You give him to me, and
we can still be friends.

409
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,893
Too late, Chica! He's gone!

410

Perfect. Just like when I was a kid.

I'm gonna need a few samples
of your blood to run some tests.

Their eyes?

443
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:28,351
It's a side effect from
one of the early vaccines

444
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:29,603
given to everyone on Zona.

445
00:25:29,638 --> 00:25:30,687
But not you?

446
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:31,888
I've never been.

447
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,057
I've only seen the inside of this sub

448
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:35,642
since we evacuated Mt. Wilson.

449
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:38,278
How do you even know Zona's real then?

450
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:40,897
I worked for some of the
people who first founded Zona

451
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:41,865
before the outbreak.

452
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,366
They're the only ones left

453
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:46,369
with enough power and
resources to stop this plague.

454
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:47,571
We almost had it.

455
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:50,624
But the vaccine only slows down the virus.

456
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:53,126
It doesn't kill it or make you immune.

457
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,245
Some of the earliest people vaccinated

458
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:58,081
are losing their immunity
and starting to turn.

459
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,549
Including the founder of Zona.

460
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:02,836
That's why we need you.

461
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:06,640
I thought the vaccine
was for all of humanity?

462
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:07,591
It will be.

463
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:13,096
Have you had any major childhood diseases?

464
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:15,015
Measles, mumps, chickenpox.

465
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:17,984
Yes, yes, and I think yes.

466
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:21,321

I was a kid. I had everything.

poison ivy, you name it.

468
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:26,776
Any sexually transmitted diseases?

469
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:34,534
The usual.

470
00:26:35,754 --> 00:26:38,288
You don't have to go into detail
The tests will tell me more.

471
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:39,422
Any children?

472
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:44,344
These are awfully personal questions.

473
00:26:46,598 --> 00:26:47,631
You mind?

474
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:50,934
A little privacy?

00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:54,688
