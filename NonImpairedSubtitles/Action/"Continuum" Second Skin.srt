1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,274
Previously, on Continuum...

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,040
Change of plan.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,071
Kiera, you're with Elena
in the chamber.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,190
Kiera!

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,237
We both know
you're not what you seem.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,150
And I got a pretty good feeling

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,958
that those answers are going
to reveal themselves

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,078
as long as someone is watching.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,310
I am done
getting my hands dirty.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,835
He who will not yield to reason,

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,479
will yield to persuasion.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,073
What will you do

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,834
when that kind of persuasion
comes looking for you?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,558
Because it will.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,597
Go!

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,749
CPS freeze!

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,189
Primary target.

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,271
Thermite detonators.
Go.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,915
Put your weapons down,
stay where you are.

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,389
(Gunfire)

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,395
Tango down.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,834
Searching for target.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,829
Target obtained.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,470
Elena?

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,039
Tango down.

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,349
Mom?

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,999
Wanna trade?

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,354
Mommy?

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,750
Hand me the detonator.

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,399
(Gunshot)

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,789
Training simulation terminated.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,155
Why the hesitation, Cameron?

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,912
We acquired the target, sir.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,913
Not good enough.

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,793
That's your problem right there.

36
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,871
They have nothing
to do with this.

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,439
We had this,
and then you saw Sam.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,881
I wasn't counting on my son
being used in a SIM like that.

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,996
CPS uses your psych eval
against you.

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,036
They know your weaknesses.

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,189
They think they do.

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,271
You didn't give me a chance
to take down Verta.

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,953
I saved you.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,840
You were reckless.

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,109
You froze.

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,201
Thanks for the support.

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,872
That's what this is, partner,

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,837
whether you realize it or not.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,195
Hey, hi sweetie!

50
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,799
You heard of Liber8?

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,915
Yeah.

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,150
Get out of the truck.

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,072
Get out!

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,993
Keep your hands up.

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,079
This isn't about you.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,673
It's about big oil.

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,833
Tell the company you work for
to stop ripping off the people.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,910
Get outta here.

59
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,832
Get outta here!

60
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,792
Let's go!

61
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,271
(Explosion)

62
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,350
(Laughing)

63
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,080
Go, go, go, go!

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,480
Another one, Ladner Trunk Road.

65
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,232
That's seven in four hours.

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,521
You've got to be kidding me.

67
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,921
Well, it looks like your pals
have found a new trajectory.

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,915
Catch me up.

69
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,513
Well, all the tankers
are owned by Ultra Gas,

70
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,591
they're targeted strikes
and all the drivers

71
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,715
were handed propaganda material.

72
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,835
That's smart.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,592
Liber8 is trying to gain favour
with the public

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,512
by going after companies
they already hate.

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,671
They dress themselves up
like Robin Hood,

76
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,000
the public is buying into it.

77
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,508
Social media
is actually rooting for Liber8.

78
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,279
Kiera, are you there?

79
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,350
This is Cameron.

80
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,316
Yeah, I know that.

81
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,754
Uh-huh.

82
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,956
What is with the connection?

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,599
That's actually why I'm calling.

84
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,955
I've been experiencing
this interference issue.

85
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,681
Kiera, listen.

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,948
Do you remember the night
that you landed?

87
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,348
Unlikely I'd forget it.

88
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,078
Well, when you crashed through
I knew something was up

89
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,601
even before you called
for back-up.

90
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,260
How?

91
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,436
Random dada suddenly spiked up
on my com-channel.

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,158
First, I thought it was static
or interference,

93
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,673
but now I know it came from you.

94
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,751
Random data, what are
you talking about, Alec?

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,876
Let's call your arrival
Hiroshima.

96
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,553
You get that?

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,393
We do have history
in the future, you know.

98
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:11,878
Good.

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,519
Then you know what Nagasaki is.

100
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,636
The second bomb to hit Japan.

101
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,313
You had another data spike.

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,435
Boom.

103
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,396
Are you sure?

104
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,629
Sure as I can be.

105
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,153
Someone else's future tech

106
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,639
just tried to access my network.

107
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,597
Similar to mine?

108
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,069
Another time traveller is online.

109
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,595
You've got company.

110
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,630
2077.

111
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,596
My time.

112
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,260
My city.

113
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,190
My family.

114
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,396
When terrorists killed
thousands of innocents,

115
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,788
they were condemned to die.

116
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,075
They had other plans.

117
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,629
A time travel device
sent us all back 65 years.

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,835
I want to get home,

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,399
but I can't be sure
what I will return to

120
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,073
if history is changed.

121
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,877
Their plan?

122
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,598
To corrupt and control
the present

123
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,239
In order to win the future.

124
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,914
What they didn't plan on,
was me.

125
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,397
Are you positive it originated
from this location?

126
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,632
49.175 North, 122.586 West.

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,153
It's as close as I can get.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,673
I've got it,
looks like a garage sale.

129
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,712
You look a little lost.

130
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,712
Ah, well, 49 degrees North
and 122 West,

131
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,438
so no, not lost.

132
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,636
Okay, now I'm lost.

133
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,519
Oh, uh, Kiera Cameron.

134
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,874
Vancouver PD.

135
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,679
Have you seen anyone around here
this morning unusual,

136
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,630
a little odd, maybe?
Uh, besides me?

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,119
The person that I'm looking for
might have been wearing

138
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,508
a very distinctive suit.

139
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,148
Copper... reflective...

140
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
Most of this stuff is my mom's,

141
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,993
but I do remember
something like that.

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,151
Or not.

143
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,153
Or I did, but I sold it.

144
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,560
I wish I could be more helpful.

145
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,875
It's imperative
that I find that suit.

146
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,359
Could I speak with your mother?

147
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,556
I mean, you said this stuff
was hers.

148
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,153
I don't know about that.

149
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,869
It may be significant
to the investigation.

150
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,512
If you give me your number,
I'll see.

151
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,990
And that is not just an excuse
to get your number.

152
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,232
People need excuses?

153
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,073
With good-looking lady cops?

154
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,514
Usually.

155
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,920
You might be right.

156
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,676
Might be?

157
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,556
The data spike:

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,995
It may have come
from another suit like mine.

159
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,479
I knew it.

160
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,829
Thanks!

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,433
Your welcome.

162
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,953
Sorry...

163
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,155
Everything okay?

164
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,196
Yep.

165
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,713
You have to track that spike.

166
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,074
Your timing sucks.

167
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Alec, I need you on this.

168
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,316
I'm barely operational
at my palatial digs,

169
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,959
my mobile unit is a joke...

170
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,870
Okay, so go home.

171
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,359
I hacked into the Aldergrove
weather radar

172
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,953
and paired it with a lighter
network that I'm not supposed

173
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,916
to know about.

174
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,035
It's a weird combo,
but it might work out

175
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,519
if it happens again.

176
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,796
You built a time travel app.

177
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,552
If you have to call it that.

178
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,472
Wait, the traveller's already here
so...

179
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,390
I have to go.

180
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,197
What?

181
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,510
If it happens again,
I'll let you know, okay?

182
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,432
Alec?

183
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,756
I'm Emily.

184
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,672
Meet to please you.

185
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,636
Sorry.

186
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,516
Alec.

187
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,829
Hi.

188
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,236
Nice to meet you.

189
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,799
Nice to meet you.

190
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,520
I've seen you here before.

191
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,398
I come here a lot.

192
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,073
Travis, oh Travis.

193
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,958
Now you are going after
gas stations.

194
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,519
You know once people have
to start lining up for fuel,

195
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,309
they are going to be pissed
at you.

196
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,074
Yeah, he's using the attacks
to spread Kagame's message.

197
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,708
That's too smart for Travis.

198
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,199
You always underestimated him.

199
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,794
Clearly you did as well.

200
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,473
How bad was it?

201
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,600
Well, they hit ten
fuel transports in the mainland

202
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,312
all with the same message:

203
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,552
Big oil is enslaving the people,
price gouging,

204
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,835
raping the earth, etcetera.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,275
Tapping into the public's growing
sense of conspiracy.

206
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,475
Yep.

207
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,632
For terrorists,
they sure have a flair for PR.

208
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,028
Think Sonya's behind this?

209
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,997
The violence is more
Travis's domain.

210
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,798
Maybe they got back together?

211
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,952
I think it's safe to say
they're still on the outs.

212
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,348
Well, whoever's behind this,

213
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,717
they've sure got
the public's attention.

214
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,472
Ah, section six calling?

215
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,868
Actually, no.

216
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,429
You know, it's ok, I'm dating other
police departments, too.

217
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,558
Kiera Cameron.

218
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,029
Hi.

219
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,952
Great.

220
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,872
I'll meet you there.

221
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,110
Let me guess: Going somewhere?

222
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,794
Gotta see a guy about a suit.

223
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,908
Um, it feels weird.

224
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,594
Well, get out here and show me.

225
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,591
I could just use my med uniform,

226
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,558
And maybe throw a tux jacket over
it?

227
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,912
Come on!

228
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,156
That's fantastic!

229
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,199
It's a dead ringer for
Captain Armstrong's suit!

230
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,634
It's a bit tight.

231
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,791
We call that form-fitting.

232
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,313
Yeah. Okay.

233
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,556
It is Patrick's big day,
what if he goes as Armstrong?

234
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,039
Patrick told me he's going
to be General Carter.

235
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,350
He can't resist those medals.

236
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,196
Best five bucks I ever spent! Hoo!

237
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,276
I don't know.

238
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,955
I think maybe Junior Medical
Officer Keaton,

239
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,634
that's more my speed.

240
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,597
Be the hero, baby.

241
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,954
You're mine.

242
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,030
And if you can't trust
your second Lieutenant Rosara,

243
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,156
then who can you trust?

244
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,789
I need to know you have my back,
Rosara.

245
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,829
You know I do, Captain, and
when you're ready for more...

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,116
Save it for the debrief...

247
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
How long has your mother suffered
from Alzheimer's?

248
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,354
Six years.

249
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,990
The doctor says she's done pretty
well, considering.

250
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,196
She's still there, you know.

251
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,512
But sometimes I'm her son,
other times...

252
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,716
But this is palliative care.

253
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,393
She's in liver failure now.

254
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,869
That's why we're here.

255
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,235
I really appreciate you
letting me come visit.

256
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,436
Hopefully it's a good night.

257
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,272
She really perked up
when I mentioned

258
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,510
you were looking for this suit.

259
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,592
Hi Mom, I brought that
police officer we talked about.

260
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,830
Hi, Mrs. Stanton.

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,911
How are you feeling today?

262
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,878
Partner!

263
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,512
Yeah.

264
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,800
You look just the same, Kiera.

265
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,076
Elena?

266
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,357
What took you so long?

267
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,195
In the first months I looked for
anyone else from the execution chamber

268
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,148
that might have come through
with me but...

269
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,993
no one.

270
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,831
No one.

271
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,116
When did you get here?

272
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,077
1975.

273
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,195
You look like everybody else,

274
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,477
you sound like everybody else,
but you're a freak.

275
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,392
A time traveller?

276
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,357
No one understands,
who can you tell?

277
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,715
But you must have, I mean,
you got married...

278
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,111
I never told.

279
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,999
I wanted to be normal.

280
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:32,160
And my husband, he gave me that
and so much more.

281
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,198
What about your husband, Kiera,
and Sam?

282
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,352
Didn't they come with you?

283
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,636
Elena, when you came through,

284
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,711
you were wearing your CPS uniform,
right?

285
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,756
Yes.

286
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,911
Yes, so...

287
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,796
I took it out kayaking, you know?

288
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,712
I've loved that since I was a kid.

289
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,677
I went out this morning.

290
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,432
You alright, mom?

291
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,193
Hmm.

292
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,999
He swore
he was going to be Mederic.

293
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,158
(Cheering and Applause)

294
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,190
Captain?

295
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,112
Oh, at ease General.

296
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,633
I think I out-rank you.

297
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,199
You may be in charge
of this wedding, General,

298
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,191
but I booked the restaurant.

299
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,315
Glad you're here.

300
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,879
Dude, it's your big day!

301
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,475
Two cutest assassins in the room.

302
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,234
Yeah. You guys um...

303
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,755
Oh, well, you know...

304
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,271
every time she comes over,
I'm still surprised.

305
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,589
Rex, the girl loves you.

306
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,990
Right, yeah, a college drop out.

307
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,640
The guy who runs
a dry-cleaning store.

308
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,478
I don't think so.

309
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,358
She sees the man.

310
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,397
I'm glad she does.

311
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,953
Rex!

312
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,519
Ah!
I'm on fire!

313
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,510
Rex!

314
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,399
Get some water!

315
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,710
Aaah!

316
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,279
Come on!

317
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,951
You alright?

318
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,916
Yeah!

319
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,479
I am!

320
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,753
I'm fine.

321
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,832
Oh, you're so stupid!

322
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,672
(Laughs)

323
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,957
What's the problem?

324
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,669
I'm not sure
and that's what worries me.

325
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,153
She was always mysterious
about her background.

326
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,710
Said her life really started
when she met my dad.

327
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,949
That's sweet.

328
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,917
How do you know her?

329
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,753
Our mothers were friends.

330
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,515
Elena helped out my mother
more times than I can count.

331
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,196
But she recognized you.

332
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,672
They probably kept in touch.

333
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,196
So, she got married,
had a family...

334
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,873
Four kids.

335
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,235
Once we were all in school,
so was she.

336
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,073
She studied urban planning,
then went to work for the city.

337
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,310
He's boasting about me.

338
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,708
Because you deserve it.

339
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,677
I deserve chocolate.

340
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,434
I'm old, and I'm cranky,
and I want chocolate.

341
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,477
I'm on it, mom.

342
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,473
My eldest.

343
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,200
The younger ones are all married
with kids. Not Dan.

344
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,672
Do you have it on?

345
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,797
Almost always.

346
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,068
Does it make you feel safe?

347
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,797
Elena, Alec Sadler is here.

348
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,075
He's a teenage boy.

349
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,958
You're shitting me.

350
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,792
We connected
the night I came through.

351
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,279
Suddenly, he was just...

352
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,032
in my head.

353
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,549
All the time you were here,
you never heard anything?

354
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,713
I turned my CMR off years ago,

355
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,112
felt like it was always looking
for voices that weren't there.

356
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,713
It drained me.

357
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,952
I could have never made it through
four kids

358
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,759
with that thing turned on.

359
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,350
What about your suit?

360
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,189
I put it away in a box somewhere.

361
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,191
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,237
You couldn't have known.

363
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,593
We hit all five targets.

364
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,795
Good.

365
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,109
Make sure they're in and out
in 10 minutes

366
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,793
before the cops can react.

367
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,839
Hey, we were professionals
before you bought the franchise.

368
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,076
I...

369
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,673
I still think we should have it
looked at.

370
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,796
It's fine, I'm fine.

371
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,188
No, it's weird.

372
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,760
What kind of material doesn't burn?

373
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,952
There are all kinds of flame
retardant material out there.

374
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,633
I guess you'd know.

375
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,870
Dry-cleaning god that I am?

376
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,269
That's not what I meant.

377
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,517
(grunts)

378
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,155
Hey!

379
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,635
I'm calling the cops.

380
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,789
Get rid of this guy.

381
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,958
Go!

382
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,874
I hate heroes.

383
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,837
You better get going, hero.

384
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,750
Rex!

385
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,716
Oh my god!

386
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,029
Rex!

387
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,792
Oh, Rexy!

388
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,157
Oh you're such a bad dog!

389
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,878
(Gunshots)

390
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,950
(Screams)

391
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,993
Whoa! Go closer!

392
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,912
Get an ambulance!

393
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,159
I want that.

394
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,675
And get me those plates.

395
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,910
Say please.

396
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,071
What's it mean?

397
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,878
Remember, I found a way
to track the Protector

398
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,792
but she shut us down...

399
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,632
That code disruption.

400
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,199
At first I thought it was Cameron

401
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,272
but these data packets
come from a different source.

402
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,874
Someone else?

403
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,952
Kagame came through weeks after us.

404
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,918
This could be someone else
from the execution chamber.

405
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,832
Find them.

406
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,271
Travis is choosing
his targets well.

407
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,158
It's like you two never broke up.

408
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,719
I don't condone the violence.

409
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,598
But the message doesn't suck.

410
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,800
It's like he's trying to send you
little love notes.

411
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,279
I doubt that.

412
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,911
You're really good to her.

413
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,229
She deserves it.

414
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,392
She's always been there for me.

415
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,959
You know?

416
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,914
The suit is active again.

417
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,718
I've got coordinates.

418
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,957
Have a good night.

419
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,633
Goodnight.

420
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,789
Those guys were off their meds.

421
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,109
It was chaos in here!

422
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,714
Then, the guy walks in,
takes two shots to the chest,

423
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,995
and walks away.

424
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,798
The place would have blown up
if he wasn't here.

425
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,641
He saved my life!

426
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,155
Was he wearing something
that resembled a uniform?

427
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,548
Form-fitting, shiny?

428
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,680
I don't know about that,

429
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,949
but he sparked
like an electrical storm

430
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,633
when that asshole shot him.

431
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,710
Hey, hey, hey,

432
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,110
is he that superhero
that's taking down Liber8?

433
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,551
Was it, Miss Cameron?

434
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,153
Someone wearing a super suit?

435
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,239
Did you ever hear
of anything like that?

436
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,274
Look at this ass clown.

437
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,032
You can clearly see
his Syndicate tattoo

438
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,838
right there on his arm.

439
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,081
I think I liked Travis more

440
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,634
when anarchy was his end goal.

441
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,190
He could really score some points
with this endeavour.

442
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,316
Looks like Sonya
might be rubbing off on him.

443
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,869
He's still got his wild side:
Beatings, weapons...

444
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,439
There's our hero.

445
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,232
Excuse me.

446
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,193
I thought you said
there was only one event.

447
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:51,951
I Missed one.

448
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,760
You gotta get your head
in the game, Alec.

449
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,750
You mean your game?

450
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,750
Alec, track down the suit.

451
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,273
Alec, find the bad guys.

452
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,317
You know how powerful
these suits are.

453
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,914
I don't need you to tell me
about something I invented.

454
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,679
You're right.

455
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,035
I'm sorry.

456
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,674
Is there any way
we could track the suit

457
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,796
If the owner wasn't wearing it?

458
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,791
Well, the suit has certain
latent functions on its own.

459
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,235
Something called
a positional contact relay.

460
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,038
It's basically
like a homing beacon.

461
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,428
It'll pin the user's CMR

462
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,318
and then you can triangulate
the suit's location.

463
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,879
What if it's out of power?

464
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,120
That's doubtful, I mean these suits
can draw a charge

465
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,151
from any power source
they come in contact with.

466
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,958
Even kinetic energy
can be absorbed.

467
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,954
Can we turn it on
with some sort of remote?

468
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,390
Let me guess:

469
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,790
Someone's standing
right beside you?

470
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,393
Oh crap.

471
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,916
Exactly.

472
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,910
So?

473
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,559
Well, if you can find
the actual traveller,

474
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,789
and get them to turn on their CMR,

475
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,633
then we could link it to the suit
and send a steady signal.

476
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,518
Any idea how to find them?

477
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,557
I'll call you back.

478
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,437
Gotta go visit a sick friend.

479
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,390
(cell phone buzzing)

480
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,797
(chuckles)

481
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,553
Your garage sale guy did not know
what he was selling.

482
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,711
Maybe he did.

483
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,357
You gonna give me
one of your Rosara speeches?

484
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,238
Captain, save the jokes
for the epilogue?

485
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,595
This is not a TV show.

486
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,350
This is your life.

487
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,871
You were shot!

488
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,189
And now you think
you're invulnerable

489
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,237
because of that stupid costume!

490
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,789
You saw what happened.

491
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,460
The wedding?

492
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,589
I should have been burned!

493
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,911
When I put the thing on,
something happens,

494
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,868
something bigger than me,
I saved that guy's life!

495
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,235
What about yours?

496
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,919
Okay, look.

497
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,589
It was a fluke.

498
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,758
I'll get rid of it.

499
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,272
Okay.

500
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,313
It just feels like
the world's gone crazy.

501
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,550
Make sure you don't.

502
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,797
What do you want?

503
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,234
Well, one shouldn't
have to drive alone

504
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,356
to see a sick friend.

505
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,034
Look.

506
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,349
We have mutual interests:

507
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,149
Stopping Liber8, restoring order...

508
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,715
Why don't we just help each other?

509
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,678
I don't think our methods
are compatible.

510
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,480
I'm sure you could talk
to your Mr. Escher

511
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,354
and tell him know
that I'm one of the good guys, no?

512
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,717
Ah, so it's Escher you really want.

513
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,270
Well, he's the one pulling
your strings, isn't he?

514
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,032
You seem to think so.

515
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,629
Tell you what, let's drive over
to Piron Corps right now,

516
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,873
we can all sit around
and talk about Section 6?

517
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,076
Maybe after I visit my sick friend.

518
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,234
You're connected
to these terrorists.

519
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,119
Maybe just in the way
that a good agent

520
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,158
becomes close
to whoever he or she is tracking.

521
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,995
But, until you get truthful
with me,

522
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,681
we're gonna be spending
a lot of time together.

523
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,676
Hmm.

524
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,398
Our first date.

525
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,553
It's not starting well.

526
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,280
Well, next time I'll bring flowers.

527
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,437
Come on.

528
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,475
Beth!

529
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,631
Oh Beth, you brought your husband.

530
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,119
Yes I did!

531
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,554
He really wanted to say hi.

532
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,392
Didn't you, honey?

533
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,395
It's so good to see you,
you look well.

534
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,869
Are you still a marine biologist,
Ben?

535
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,268
I remember the dolphins.

536
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,350
So pink.

537
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,913
Mmm hmm, in China
well they're so memorable.

538
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,229
I'll be outside.

539
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,549
Excuse me.

540
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,553
You are sharp as a tack.

541
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,511
Who's the asshole?

542
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,510
Federal agent.

543
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,908
He thinks I'm special.

544
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,830
He's right.

545
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,796
Listen, partner.

546
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,554
I think Liber8
knows about your suit.

547
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,950
I can't let them
get their hands on it,

548
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,554
and I need you to help me find it.

549
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,321
I don't know what I can do
from this bed.

550
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,430
Can you turn on your CMR?

551
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,350
If you can connect with the suit,

552
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,149
Alec can trace it,
it's like a homing beacon.

553
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,554
Turn it on...

554
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,914
it didn't feel good.

555
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,399
I know it makes you nervous,

556
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,028
but when we were together
during the wars,

557
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,634
I always felt safer
with you as my partner.

558
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,870
It's been too long.

559
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,554
You were always the strong one.

560
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,597
Not anymore.

561
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,870
It scares me.

562
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,828
I know.

563
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,756
But I'm right here with you.

564
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,079
Alright.

565
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,919
Do it.

566
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,115
Go ahead, Alec.

567
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,918
You sure?

568
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,796
Yeah.

569
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,234
What about your new boyfriend?

570
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,515
I can handle him.

571
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,240
Okay, here goes.

572
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,868
I'm cycling all other CMRs.

573
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,278
Elena?

574
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,112
I forgot how it feels.

575
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,508
It's so powerful.

576
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,752
When I find the suit,
I'll switch it off.

577
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,433
There it is, I've got it.

578
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,591
I'll get an address.

579
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,275
Sonya, it's live again.

580
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,119
You do have a partner.

581
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,032
Carlos is my partner.

582
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,996
He's a good cop.

583
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,072
I'll be the judge of that,
I want to meet him.

584
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,071
I'll see what I can do.

585
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,915
You should go.

586
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,150
You ready to lay down some cover?

587
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,799
Deal me in.

588
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,516
Yes, everyone.

589
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,118
Where is she?

590
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,398
Where is she?

591
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,757
Escher?

592
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,832
You're looking for Escher,
the mystery man?

593
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,948
You don't know anything.

594
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,111
I'm here, she's not.

595
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,391
You wanna roll the dice?

596
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,031
Come out, hero.

597
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,749
Strip down now,
I'll go easier on you.

598
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,832
(fighting grunts)

599
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,752
Pretty head, shame to detach it.

600
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,797
(fighting grunts)

601
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,549
(Gunshots)

602
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,274
Are you hurt?

603
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,319
Well, you shot me!

604
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,755
Yes, but you're not hurt.

605
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,592
Perfect.

606
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,635
That suit won't protect you
forever.

607
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,796
Drop the gun.

608
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,757
This again.

609
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,753
You're not gonna shoot me.

610
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,309
You'd have already
pulled that trigger.

611
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,238
You've been busy.

612
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,516
Take off the suit, you might live!

613
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,272
You don't need that uniform.

614
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,031
Need.

615
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,394
Want.

616
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,675
Semantics.

617
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,558
(fighting grunts)

618
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,077
(Gunshots)

619
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,837
(grunts)

620
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,952
Aaah!

621
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,796
Put it down,
and you get to walk away.

622
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,678
Is that what you told Travis
before you shot him?

623
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,308
You're a lot smarter
than I gave you credit for, Garza.

624
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,549
It's not too late to reconsider.

625
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,396
You made my bed,
I like lying in it.

626
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,516
I don't want to hurt you.

627
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,268
(Gunshots)

628
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,470
Shit!

629
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,755
(fighting grunts)

630
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,275
(fighting grunts)

631
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,795
Let's move!

632
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,790
(Gunshots)

633
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,950
(Gunshots)

634
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,155
We gotta go!

635
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,514
(Gunshots)

636
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,719
Dammit!

637
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,998
Civilian down, I need an ambulance.

638
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,550
Suspect is heading East
from 95 Parker.

639
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,161
You've got one, too?

640
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,110
Shh, it's okay.

641
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,429
It's gonna be okay.

642
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,874
Rest.
We're getting you help.

643
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,349
I thought it would make me a hero.

644
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,114
You don't need a suit for that.

645
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Okay, okay, okay,
alright, okay, okay, okay...

646
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,511
Okay, I'm just going to open the...
okay.

647
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,915
(crying)
Rex, oh... you okay?

648
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,876
Ma'am.

649
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,190
Agent Gardner.

650
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,190
Where's the suit?

651
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,952
Where's the suit?
Was he wearing a suit?

652
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,632
Go away!

653
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,516
Was he wearing the suit?!

654
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,237
Stop!

655
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,311
Don't shout at her.

656
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,511
Save it for the debrief.

657
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,999
Here you go.

658
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,439
You're bringing this here?

659
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,079
Is this some sort of elaborate
attempt to get rid of me?

660
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,515
I deactivated it,
there's no signal.

661
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,749
I knew you'd wanna play with it.

662
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,673
Plus, I don't think this place
is on Liber8's radar,

663
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,034
so you should be safe.

664
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,316
This place is only temporary.

665
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,232
How temporary?

666
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,914
I don't know, we'll see.

667
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,480
Look, I kinda have some stuff
to do.

668
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,113
Like what?

669
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,870
Alright...

670
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,951
You have a life.

671
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,473
Trying to.

672
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,508
Alec!

673
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,679
Hey!

674
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,431
Hey, sorry I'm late.

675
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,431
No, I just got here myself.

676
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,556
What?

677
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,233
You lost a bet, right?

678
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,391
You forgot to save a country
from a burgeoning debt crisis

679
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,118
and this was your punishment?

680
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
To date below your level?

681
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,796
Right, because smart and funny
is such a step down.

682
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,030
Do I really seem like I'd date
a jock kind of girl to you?

683
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,349
I don't know, I'm just thinking
about the fact

684
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,839
you called me smart and funny.

685
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,069
Oh, but there's plenty of time
for you

686
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,708
to disabuse me of that notion.

687
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,519
Well, I'll give it my best shot.

688
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,953
I guess you drink coffee?

689
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,156
Um, yes...

690
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,629
What kind of coffee?

691
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,120
Are you sure this is okay?

692
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,999
Yeah, just a heads up,
she's a little scattered,

693
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,001
she might say some things
that don't make sense

694
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,873
but she insisted on meeting you.

695
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,955
I guess she wants to check you out.

696
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,633
Sounds like a good friend.

697
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,075
She's more than a friend.

698
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,275
Thanks for the support.

699
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,192
That's what partners do.

700
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,792
Hi.

701
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,233
It's okay.

702
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,508
Dan, this is Detective Fonnegra.

703
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,396
Nice to meet you.

704
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,834
Likewise.

705
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,471
We managed to get
most of the family here,

706
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,709
she knew us all.

707
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,108
Remembered everything.

708
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,999
Never checked out,
not even for a second.

709
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,357
She came back
for most of the night.

710
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,272
But she wasn't even that sick?

711
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,714
The doctors said
that kind of resurgence

712
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,395
isn't unusual just before death.

713
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,515
I'm so sorry.

714
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,476
Don't be.

715
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,108
We had a beautiful goodbye.

716
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,075
You were a tonic for her.

717
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,276
I don't know if that's true.

718
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,552
She said you should have this.

719
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,950
She must have read it
a dozen times.

720
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,315
Only Connect.

721
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,429
It's a little sermon, really,
about ending isolation.

722
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,034
She wanted you to know
that she loved her life,

723
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,475
and you can too.

724
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,108
Excuse me.

725
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,157
I'm sorry for your loss.

726
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,717
Sure you don't want to go
out there with them?

727
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,440
Who would have imagined,

728
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,989
he has such a beautiful family.

729
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,876
Am I ever
going to meet your family?

730
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,068
You have no idea
how much I would love that.

731
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,151
Have you seen your son lately?

732
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:51,031
Oh yeah, I see him all the time.
