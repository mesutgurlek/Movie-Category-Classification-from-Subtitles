Oh, so sweet of you to care about my investment.

Now, relax.

19

What do you want?

39
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,829
I just don't like seeing a man like you living like this.

40
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:09,081
So you're a humanitarian now.

Yeah.

- No? - No, thank you.

48
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:29,644
Well, this is acceptable to you?

49
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:33,064
This is where I am.

50

00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,966
You want to fight Sykov with one knee?

56
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:03,636
Pardon me.

57
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:07,390
Okay, let's say you get past Sykov, which will only happen in your fantasy...

58
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,935
...what's gonna happen in the tournament against the best fighters?

59
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:13,646
It's suicide. Boyka, you...

60
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:22,863
It is a suicide, isn't it?

00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:55,097
Oh, I said you was a charming motherfucker.

171
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:56,307
Sir.

172
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:58,601
If you'd rather go home, we can arrange for that.

173
00:17:58,768 --> 00:18:01,187
Uh-huh. That's exactly where I'm headed.

174
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:04,607
Soon as I get done with this bullshit here.

175
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:06,567
Then I suggest you keep your mouth shut.

176
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:10,821
Heh, heh. Well, you're the only one talking, nigga. What?

177
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:15,034
You know, I've turned delinquent people like you.

178
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,912
What do you mean people like me?

179
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:22,333
I've turned delinquent people like you into a science.

180
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,919
If you insist on this insolence...

181
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:28,631
...trust me, you'll find yourself in a most regrettable situation.

182
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:30,091
You think so?

183
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:03,624
Come on, fight the duel.

184
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:30,693
FARNATTl: So you know this Rezo guy?

185
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:31,110
FARNATTl: So you know this Rezo guy?

186
00:19:31,277 --> 00:19:34,655
I did some business with him in the past.

187
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:36,449
Some say he has vision.

188
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:38,451
What do you say?

189
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:44,206
I say he's an old fart who thinks he still smells good.

190
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:47,084
You have a way with words, Gaga.

191
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:57,219
My friends...

192
00:19:57,386 --> 00:20:01,641
...welcome to our first Prison Spetz Competition.

193
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:04,310
Please sit.

194
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,153
Gentlemen...

195
00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:17,490
...we have before us a rare opportunity.

196
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:23,496
When our syndicate invited members of the underworld here...

197
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,710
...their interest was in the one thing we all had in common...

198
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:31,295
"'money'

199
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:37,176
How do we ensure the highest profit at the lowest risk?

200
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:41,347
I know you all worked hard to get here.

201
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:44,016
It is not easy to do what we do.

202
00:20:44,183 --> 00:20:47,311
And even those with a lot of power...

203
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,189
...had to pull many different strings...

204
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,904
...to get our fighters released and brought to this one spot here on earth.

205
00:20:57,571 --> 00:20:59,699
But, here we are.

206
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:01,200
Enjoy.

207
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:24,015
Some of you here have been wondering about training.

208
00:21:24,181 --> 00:21:26,809
You'll each be given one hour a day to train.

209
00:21:27,184 --> 00:21:32,857
But, before that, we'd like you to enjoy some fresh air and general exercise.

210
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:54,105
Water. Thank you.

211
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:56,315
Water.

212
00:22:56,732 --> 00:22:58,693
Water, over here.

213
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,277
Thanks.

214
00:23:00,277 --> 00:23:00,861
Thanks.

215
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,614
You're welcome.

216
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:11,622
Fuck me. Damn.

217
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:13,165
I can't do this shit.

218
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,251
Say, hey, yo.

219
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:17,169
What the fuck does this shit do?

220
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:19,755
Shut your mouth. Keep working.

221
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:22,842
No, see these motherfuckers out here, that's they job to work.

222
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,719
I'm a fighter. This is bullshit.

223
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:29,598
You got a problem with me, man?

224
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,024
Hey, hey. Hey, I'm talking to you. You got a fucking problem with me, man?

225
00:23:38,232 --> 00:23:40,735

Why don't you shut the fuck up already?

226
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:45,114
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said...

227
00:23:45,281 --> 00:23:47,950
...because, my hearing, sometimes it comes and goes.

228
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:49,368
What was that?

229
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:53,664
Fucking Americans, all talk too much.

230
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:57,918
Now I'm gonna come over this rock, kick your ass, right here, right now.

231
00:23:58,085 --> 00:24:01,881

Hey. Stop right now. You fight in the ring, nowhere else.

232
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,925
Fuck you. This ain't Roots, bitch.

233
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:08,054
You fix your fucking mouth when you talk to me.

234
00:24:11,223 --> 00:24:13,601
What the fuck is this bullshit?

235
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,233


236
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:44,382
I hope you've enjoyed your first day.

237
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,800
And, now, as promised...

238
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:49,011
...if any of you would like to train for tomorrow's first round...

239
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,638
...you have one hour.

240
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:04,026
I don't know about you right now, man.

241
00:25:04,694 --> 00:25:06,654
It's showtime.

242
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:28,384
Seven...

243
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,178
What you looking at?

244
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,972
Oh, I know...

245
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,641
...you just saw your lights go out.

246
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:37,228
Bling.

247
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:39,312
The time will come.

248
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:01,709
This is for you.

249
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:03,502
How do you feel?

250
00:26:05,171 --> 00:26:07,006
I feel good.

251
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:12,261
But I'll feel better after my chocolate.

252
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,722
Of course you will.

253
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:53,427
You have your sparring practice. Enjoy.

254
00:27:48,774 --> 00:27:51,235
FARNATTl: Charming place, Rezo. You spare all expenses.

255
00:27:51,444 --> 00:27:53,738
How you doing? Great. Had to bring my boys out.

256
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:55,823
Ladies and gentlemen...

257
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,618
...fighting out of Greece, Petros Mavros...

258
00:27:59,785 --> 00:28:05,750
...against the Brazilian, Andriago Silva.

259
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:19,221
Are you ready?

260
00:28:19,388 --> 00:28:21,307
Are you ready?

261
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,767
Fight.

262
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,332
This guy ain't bad, huh?

263
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,225
Stop. Stop. Step back.

264
00:29:46,392 --> 00:29:48,728
Doctor. It is enough.

265
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,986
- Winner. Yeah.

266
00:29:57,737 --> 00:30:02,366
The winner from Brazil, Andriago Silva.

267
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:07,496
FARNATTl: Okay, watch this.

268
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:09,290
Try not to get too depressed.

269
00:30:09,457 --> 00:30:11,459
I'll do my best.

270
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:16,505
And now, for the second bout of our first-round elimination...

271
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:19,717
...representing the United States of America...

272
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,260
...Turbo.

273
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:23,554
And representing Croatia...

274
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,765
...Andrei Kraitz.

275
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:28,559
Are you ready? Are you ready?

276
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:30,436
Fight.

277
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:34,231


278
00:31:59,108 --> 00:32:01,110
- You can't stop me. FARNATTl: How did you like that?

279
00:32:01,277 --> 00:32:02,361
Winner.

280
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:04,322
The winner of the second fight...

281
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:08,492
- ... from the U.S.A., Turbo. - You see that guys? All right.

282
00:32:09,035 --> 00:32:14,540
For the third bout in our first round, from Russia, Boyka.

283
00:32:14,707 --> 00:32:17,960
And from France, Jean Dupont.

284
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:20,046
Here's your boy.

285
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:21,631
Yeah.

286
00:32:22,465 --> 00:32:23,674
Fight.

287
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,885


288
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:13,492
Winner.

289
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:13,534
Winner.

290
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:14,035
Winner.

291
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:18,205
And the winner is Boyka.

292
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,091
What?

293
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:31,469
Have a carrot.

294
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:32,762
It's good for you.

295
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:36,974
From Colombia, Raul Quinones.

296
00:34:37,183 --> 00:34:38,726
And from North Korea....

297
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,020
FARNATTl: You hear about this Colombian fuck?

298
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:43,064
Only that he's a 2-to-1 favorite.

299
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,441
Raul Quinones.

300
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:48,402
They call him Dolor. The Pain.

301
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:50,154
Cali cartel enforcer.

302
00:34:50,363 --> 00:34:52,823
Busted here 10 years ago on a trafficking beef.

303
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:14,220
CROWD Dolor, Dolor, Dolor.

304
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:19,433
Dolor, Dolor, Dolor.

305
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:23,187
Dolor, Dolor, Dolor.

306
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:26,023
Dolor, Dolor, Dolor.

307
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:29,318
Dolor, Dolor, Dolor.

308
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:44,435
Yeah.

309
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:49,649
And the winner is Raul Quinones.

310
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,035
Well.

311
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:04,246
I'm afraid this is the end of the line for all of you.

312
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,290
Pity about your freedom.

313
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:09,126
I hope you enjoyed your time in Gorgon.

314
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,878
Come visit us again sometime.

315
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,979
Okay.

316
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:30,690
Your escorts will pick you up here.

317
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:34,652
Enjoy your trip home.

318
00:37:57,758 --> 00:37:59,719
Put them in the oven.

319
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:23,576
- Unh. - Saw you fight last night.

320
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:26,329
I ain't gonna lie. You got some skills.

321
00:38:28,414 --> 00:38:31,667
Unh. - But that shit don't matter to me.

322
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:33,919
Because I got skills too.

323
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,340
Talkative motherfucker, that's good. Speaking skills...

324
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:40,176
Hey, who told you to stop?

325
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:48,100
Keep working.

326
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:55,733
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

327
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,610
When I get that ass...

328
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:04,575
You need to shut your fucking mouth.

329
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:09,121
Want some?

330
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:10,665
Here it comes.

331
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:01,549
I'm gonna take your motherfucking head.

332
00:40:01,716 --> 00:40:03,676
- Take your ass. - Fuck you.

333
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:04,885
Take them to the hole.

334
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:13,060
Get the fuck off me, man.

335
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:15,146
I'm fucking walking, man, fuck.

336
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,939
Let me go, man.

337
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:19,650
Stop, stop, go. Hey.

338
00:40:26,532 --> 00:40:28,034
Inside.

339
00:40:28,617 --> 00:40:31,537
You're a tough guy now, huh?

340
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:56,020
Yo, Russia.

341
00:40:57,563 --> 00:41:00,274
Russia, you out there?

342
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,491
I can't fucking breathe in this fucking box.

343
00:41:08,658 --> 00:41:11,952
You know that was some bitch shit you pulled. You know that, right?

344
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,914
Sneak a nigga when he ain't looking. That's some bitch shit.

345
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:18,751
That shit might be cool where you from. Where I'm from, bitches do that.

346
00:41:18,918 --> 00:41:20,461
You hear me?

347
00:41:20,628 --> 00:41:21,796
Bitches.

348
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:24,382
I'm fucking talking to you, dude.

349
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,845
Where I come from...

350
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:33,432
...people don't talk unless they have something to say.

351
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,726
Yeah, well....

352
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,604
Just saying if that's how you gotta win...

353
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,233
...maybe you shouldn't be here.

354
00:41:44,026 --> 00:41:45,653
You hear that?

355
00:41:45,945 --> 00:41:48,864
Maybe your fucking ass shouldn't be here.

356
00:42:12,722 --> 00:42:13,973
Yo, Russia.

357
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:15,641
Russia?

358
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:18,060
I need to take a shit.

359
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:24,442
Say, man, I need to take a shit, and I can't find no place to do it.

360
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,112
- Yo! - What?

361
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:32,283
Fucking need to take a shit, and I can't find no place to do it, man.

362
00:42:33,326 --> 00:42:35,328
What do you think I should do?

363
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:40,708
I think you should fucking hang yourself.

364
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,710
Fuck you.

365
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:48,883
I can't find no place to squat myself.

366
00:43:06,525 --> 00:43:08,361
What the fuck was that?

367
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:13,115
Russia?

368
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:16,994
Russia, they've got fucking things moving in my cell, man.

369
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:18,871
- Russia? - What?

370
00:43:21,624 --> 00:43:23,417
What's your name, man?

371
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:24,877
Seriously.

372
00:43:25,044 --> 00:43:26,212
Just be quiet.

373
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,882
You can't fucking tell me your name, man'

374
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:33,552
You can't fucking tell me your fucking name?

375
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:35,429
Fuck you.

376
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:37,056
I'll fucking talk to myself.

377
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:40,685
Have a better fucking conversation anyway, you fake-ass caveman.

378
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,436
Motherfucker.

379
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:44,021
Fuck.

380
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,108
Somebody let me out this motherfucker!

381
00:43:47,942 --> 00:43:49,026
Fuck.

382
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:06,627
No, no, no.

383
00:44:06,794 --> 00:44:09,255
We're not gonna wait. We're gonna see our clients now.

384
00:44:09,422 --> 00:44:11,340
Gaga, please.

385
00:44:14,302 --> 00:44:15,970
See what you could do.

386
00:44:17,847 --> 00:44:20,016
Brings back memories.

387
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,278
It was a good fight the other day. How are you?

388
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:34,155
How am I?

389
00:44:35,531 --> 00:44:36,615
Yes, how are you?

390
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,702
Did you set me up?

391
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:42,496
What's going on?

392
00:44:43,122 --> 00:44:45,291
What sort of fucking tournament is this?

393
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:47,626
Boyka, cut to the chase. What's going on?

394
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:50,004
We're being forced to do hard labor.

395
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:53,633
Hard labor? What the fuck are you talking about?

396
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:56,177
I'm talking about I'm breaking rocks with a hammer.

397
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:57,762
Some fucking chain-gang shit.

398
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:00,640
Son of a bitch.

399
00:45:00,806 --> 00:45:03,142
Yeah. You gonna do something about it?

400
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:05,144
Consider it done.

401
00:45:05,353 --> 00:45:08,648
Lying cocksuckers.

402
00:45:12,193 --> 00:45:16,697
I swear to Christ, I'm gonna fucking clip somebody before this day is over.

403
00:45:26,415 --> 00:45:28,417
Gentlemen. - You cocksucker.

404
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:31,420
- What the fuck are you doing? - Of course you know Mr. Rezo.

405
00:45:34,423 --> 00:45:36,008
My friends.

406
00:45:36,175 --> 00:45:37,510
You seem agitated.

407
00:45:37,677 --> 00:45:40,388
Agitated? Why is my fighter doing hard labor?

408
00:45:40,554 --> 00:45:43,015
Because you want him to lose, of course.

409
00:45:43,182 --> 00:45:44,976
What did you expect?

410
00:45:45,184 --> 00:45:47,728
Did you really think...

411
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,943
...that I would not arrange for things to go my way?

412
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,530
You motherfucker, you know how much cash I dropped to get my fighter here?

413
00:45:57,697 --> 00:45:58,864
Of course I do.

414
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:00,408
I will fucking destroy you.

415
00:46:00,574 --> 00:46:02,535
Okay, perhaps.

416
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:06,122
Or maybe there is another way we can go.

417
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:09,250
Remember what I said at the dinner?

418
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:14,255
How do we ensure the greatest profit at the lowest risk?

419
00:46:15,256 --> 00:46:17,717
So my suggestion is this:

420
00:46:18,134 --> 00:46:22,263
Go under your mattresses, find all the money you can...

421
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:27,560

...liquefy everything and put it all on the Colombian.

422
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:34,066
Do this and you will leave here richer men than ever you could've dreamed.

423
00:46:35,067 --> 00:46:37,194
- What about our fighters? - Fuck your fighters.

424
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:39,488
Fuck our fighters?

425
00:46:39,655 --> 00:46:41,657
They're the weak horses.

426
00:46:41,824 --> 00:46:43,909
We put them down with the rest.

427
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,498
Can you guarantee that my fighter doesn't win?

428
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:55,504
This I absolutely guarantee.

429
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:13,981
Hey. Would you stop pulling?

430
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:16,442
I'm not pulling.

431
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,028
Yes, you are.

432
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:23,616
You see me move, you move with me.

433
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,244
I ain't Ginger Rogers, and your ass ain't Fred Astaire.

434
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:30,498
Give me a warning, and I'll move with you.

435
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:33,250
- Okay. - Okay.

436
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:35,127
I'm going to move now.

437
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:39,674
That's funny, huh?

438
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,385
Wanna do this again? End up in the motherfucking hole?

439
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:44,095
Is that what you want?

440
00:47:44,303 --> 00:47:45,888

Sure, it is.

441
00:47:46,055 --> 00:47:47,098
So I'll tell you what.

442
00:47:47,306 --> 00:47:49,350
I want nothing more but to get into your ass.

443
00:47:49,517 --> 00:47:52,228
But we're gonna do it in a ring where it matters. Got it?

444
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,898
- Fine. - Fine.

445
00:47:56,065 --> 00:47:58,192
Uh... On three.

446
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,611
One, two, three.

447
00:48:07,493 --> 00:48:08,995
You know what?

448
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:10,496
Where is that Colombian motherfucker anyway?

449
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:12,248
Where is that Colombian motherfucker anyway?

450
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:52,872
Thanks.

451
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:59,045
So, what did they clip you for?

452
00:48:59,211 --> 00:49:01,005
What? More bread.

453
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:04,050
What'd they pop you for? What's your sentence?

454
00:49:05,593 --> 00:49:07,428
I speak English.

455
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:09,138
Do you?

456
00:49:09,764 --> 00:49:15,061
I was just asking what are you actually in this motherfucker for?

457
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:17,605
Committed crime.

458
00:49:19,398 --> 00:49:20,733
You don't wanna talk?

459
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:22,109
Fine, we ain't gotta talk.

460
00:49:22,276 --> 00:49:25,279
- Talking's bullshit anyway. - It's not my strength.

461
00:49:25,905 --> 00:49:27,573
No shit.

462
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:40,836
You know what's going on, right?

463
00:49:41,003 --> 00:49:42,213
What?

464
00:49:42,421 --> 00:49:44,632
This shit's fixed.

465
00:49:45,424 --> 00:49:46,550
What shit?

466
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,387
This shit. This fucking tournament.

467
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:53,057
And what's worse is we was fixed in this fixed motherfucker.

468
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:56,435
That why the fucking Colombian's in a cell sipping on pina coladas...

469
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:58,229
...while we're busting our asses.

470
00:49:58,396 --> 00:49:59,730
Of course.

471
00:50:00,272 --> 00:50:01,691
What do you mean of course?

472
00:50:01,857 --> 00:50:03,985
This is surprise to you?

473
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:06,028
I came here to win.

474
00:50:06,195 --> 00:50:07,655
So did I.

475
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:12,535
So this don't piss you off at all?

476
00:50:15,663 --> 00:50:18,249
Winning takes many things.

477
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:20,668
Who can be the best fighter, yes, of course.

478
00:50:20,835 --> 00:50:23,129
But most important...

479
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:28,509
...who can survive.

480
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:32,638
Survive what?

481
00:50:38,144 --> 00:50:40,479
In here, the people you fight...

482
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:43,107
...they are not just in the ring.

483
00:50:51,157 --> 00:50:52,992
Hey, come here.

484
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,535
The key.

485
00:51:07,673 --> 00:51:09,300
We can train?

486
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,890
One hour.

487
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:20,394
Are you fucking crazy?

488
00:51:21,395 --> 00:51:23,147
Fuck that.

489
00:51:23,522 --> 00:51:26,651
I can barely fucking walk. Working out...

490
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,542
Is that all you got?

491
00:51:50,466 --> 00:51:52,677
I'll give you a little test.

492
00:52:00,977 --> 00:52:02,061

Luka, listen to me.

493
00:52:02,228 --> 00:52:03,813
I need you to liquefy the fund.

494
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:04,897
Yes, all of it.

495
00:52:04,897 --> 00:52:05,022
Yes, all of it.

496
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,275
No, no, no. By tomorrow.

497
00:52:08,442 --> 00:52:11,779
I... I don't give a flying fuck how.

498
00:52:11,946 --> 00:52:13,781
Send a pigeon if you have to, okay?

499
00:52:14,573 --> 00:52:16,742
I know, Vito. I know you vouched for me, Vito.

500
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:20,371
But look, I need another million like yesterday.

501
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,415
Vito, this is a sure thing. It's a lock.

502
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:27,712
Yeah.

503
00:52:34,427 --> 00:52:35,886
Well, well, well.

504
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:37,471
Look who's here.

505
00:52:39,932 --> 00:52:42,143
What the fuck is he doing here?

506
00:52:46,605 --> 00:52:48,649
Breakfast is over.

507
00:52:53,612 --> 00:52:56,115
This is some fucking bullshit.

508
00:52:56,282 --> 00:52:57,742
It's a fucking joke.

509
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:00,286
I'm suppose to fight like this. They starving me out...

510
00:53:00,453 --> 00:53:01,871
- You curse too much. - Fuck you.

511
00:53:02,038 --> 00:53:03,289
Then quit.

512
00:53:03,456 --> 00:53:05,833
Go back where you fucking came from.

513
00:53:07,168 --> 00:53:09,170
Maybe we can turn this around.

514
00:53:11,547 --> 00:53:15,009
- What the fuck does that mean? - We can turn it to our advantage.

515
00:53:17,303 --> 00:53:18,429
Improvise.

516
00:53:18,638 --> 00:53:19,680
Adapt.

517
00:53:19,847 --> 00:53:21,557
Overcome.

518
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,352
- What? - Nothing, nothing.

519
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:25,811
How?

520
00:53:25,978 --> 00:53:28,481
We can say this is work.

521
00:53:29,023 --> 00:53:31,359
Or we can say this is training.

522
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:37,782
One.

523
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:39,283
Two.

524
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:40,868
Three.

525
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:49,377
Six, seven, eight...

526
00:53:49,543 --> 00:53:51,921
...nine, 10.

527
00:54:26,288 --> 00:54:27,915
What's wrong with your knee?

528
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:29,208
I'm fine.

529
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,003
- You don't act like you're fine. - I said I'm fine.

530
00:54:48,602 --> 00:54:51,689
Squeeze that in your hand. Take the oil and rub it on your knee.

531
00:54:53,899 --> 00:54:55,359
Do it.

532
00:54:56,569 --> 00:54:57,570
How do you know this?

533
00:54:57,737 --> 00:55:01,741
Improvise, adapt, overcome.

534
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:03,743
I know a whole lot of shit, Russia.

535
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,828
I know a whole lot of shit. Now let's go.

536
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:06,746
Come on.

537
00:55:09,123 --> 00:55:10,541
Come on.

538
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:13,294
Three, two....

539
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:28,934
Children?

540
00:55:31,312 --> 00:55:33,272
You have children?

541
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:38,152
Yeah.

542
00:55:40,988 --> 00:55:42,531
Boy and a girl.

543
00:55:44,784 --> 00:55:46,118
You?

544
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:49,872
No.

545
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:51,791
Ever wanted any?

546
00:55:55,336 --> 00:55:56,420
Never?

547
00:55:56,712 --> 00:55:58,047
No.

548
00:55:58,464 --> 00:56:01,008
- Never wanted a son... - You ask too many questions.

549
00:56:06,472 --> 00:56:08,724
This is why you want to win?

550
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:10,685
Children?

551
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:15,189
I've been locked up for a long time.

552
00:56:17,149 --> 00:56:19,944
I mean, I ain't seen my youngest, my sweet girl, for....

553
00:56:20,152 --> 00:56:21,445
Since she was four weeks old.

554
00:56:21,654 --> 00:56:22,863
Water?

555
00:56:27,243 --> 00:56:28,744
What about you?

556
00:56:31,038 --> 00:56:32,498
I have to win.

557
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,419
You have to win.

558
00:56:36,585 --> 00:56:38,629
You would not understand.

559
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:39,839
Try me.

560
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:47,722
God has given me a gift.

561
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,181
Only one.

562
00:56:51,434 --> 00:56:54,729
I am the most complete fighter...

563
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:56,689
...in the world.

564
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:01,068
My whole life, I've trained.

565
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:04,822
For what?

566
00:57:06,866 --> 00:57:09,535
I must prove I am worthy of something.

567
00:57:11,912 --> 00:57:13,372
Damn.

568
00:57:15,124 --> 00:57:18,210
I'm gonna feel bad when I'm whipping that ass.

569
00:57:27,303 --> 00:57:29,096
It's about time.

570
00:57:36,562 --> 00:57:38,564
I'd like to place a new bet.

571
00:57:38,773 --> 00:57:40,232
Absolutely, Mr. Gaga.

572
00:57:59,752 --> 00:58:02,505
Announcing semifinal first fight...

573
00:58:02,672 --> 00:58:04,548
...for Prison Spetz Competition.

574
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:06,008
Here.

575
00:58:07,259 --> 00:58:11,430

Our first-round fight in the semifinal is Boyka of Russia...

576
00:58:11,847 --> 00:58:14,767
...versus Andriago Silva of Brazil.

577
00:58:14,934 --> 00:58:16,394
Are you ready?

578
00:58:16,602 --> 00:58:18,229
Are you ready?

579
00:58:18,437 --> 00:58:19,897
Fight.

580
00:58:22,316 --> 00:58:23,734
Fist.

581
01:00:43,207 --> 01:00:46,669
Stop, stop, enough.

582
01:00:55,428 --> 01:00:57,096
Good fight.

583
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:04,478
Winner.

584
01:01:04,645 --> 01:01:07,231
The first fight of the semifinal.

585
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:11,152
The winner is Boyka from Russia.

586
01:01:30,379 --> 01:01:32,381
I'm worried, Kuss.

587
01:01:32,548 --> 01:01:37,511
That Russian Boyka looks very strong.

588
01:01:37,678 --> 01:01:39,221
Too strong.

589
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:45,936
I can only imagine that the American will look the same.

590
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,608
Perhaps your methods...

591
01:01:51,692 --> 01:01:53,235
...are inadequate.

592
01:01:53,402 --> 01:01:54,945
I will step up my efforts.

593
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:07,625
Look, you motherfuckers wanna tell me what this shit's about?

594
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:10,086
I want to talk to you about your training partner.

595
01:02:10,711 --> 01:02:13,381
- My who? - The Russian.

596
01:02:13,547 --> 01:02:17,093
Well, you gonna have to talk to the Russian about the Russian.

597
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:19,345
I understand you two have become sexual.

598
01:02:22,264 --> 01:02:25,017
What you say? Because sometimes my hearing comes and goes.

599
01:02:25,184 --> 01:02:28,020
- They say you two are lovers. - They say?

600
01:02:28,187 --> 01:02:31,440
You should know we don't allow such perversions in this institution.

601
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:34,318
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

602
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:52,003
Take him to his cell.

603
01:03:26,537 --> 01:03:28,164
Hey, hey.

604
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:32,251
Hey.

605
01:03:33,586 --> 01:03:35,129
Russia.

606
01:03:39,675 --> 01:03:41,010
Hey.

607
01:03:44,013 --> 01:03:45,222
The fucking warden.

608
01:03:46,974 --> 01:03:48,184
You need doctor.

609
01:03:48,351 --> 01:03:50,061
Fuck that.

610
01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:54,231
Fucking give them the satisfaction?

611
01:03:55,066 --> 01:03:56,525
You take care of business.

612
01:03:56,984 --> 01:03:59,737
You and me, we got a date in the ring, right?

613
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:01,864
Right?

614
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,617
Right?

615
01:04:24,512 --> 01:04:27,390
You know, when I was in the hole...

616
01:04:27,556 --> 01:04:33,145
...I remember hearing great stories about Yuri Boyka.

617
01:04:33,312 --> 01:04:36,774
King of prison fighters.

618
01:04:37,608 --> 01:04:39,276
I thought he must be....

619
01:04:42,863 --> 01:04:45,157
But then he lose.

620
01:04:45,616 --> 01:04:48,452
He lose to an American boxer.

621
01:04:48,828 --> 01:04:52,206
They say Boyka's a wounded horse now.

622
01:04:52,999 --> 01:04:56,377
He's a champion of the toilets.

623
01:05:00,006 --> 01:05:03,092
If I'm champion of the toilets...

624
01:05:03,259 --> 01:05:07,305
...what does that make you when I kick the fucking shit out of you?

625
01:05:07,763 --> 01:05:11,934
It's okay, muneco.

626
01:05:18,274 --> 01:05:22,153
Make sure you spend some quality time with your American boyfriend.

627
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,905
It will be his last.

628
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:39,832
Get them to work.

629
01:07:44,962 --> 01:07:47,465
How well do you know the forest?

630
01:07:48,257 --> 01:07:50,134
- What? - Look, it's no time to bullshit me.

631
01:07:50,343 --> 01:07:52,637
You were military, yes?

632
01:07:55,014 --> 01:07:56,807
Listen to me.

633
01:07:57,141 --> 01:08:01,479
You will not survive the fight tomorrow, they will make sure of it.

634
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:06,484
I don't give a fuck.

635
01:08:07,902 --> 01:08:10,154
You must give a fuck.

636
01:08:21,707 --> 01:08:23,042
Shit.

637
01:08:23,209 --> 01:08:25,419
These motherfuckers will not break me.

638
01:08:25,586 --> 01:08:26,837
I'm gonna finish this shit.

639
01:08:27,046 --> 01:08:29,006
This is not the time. You must leave here.

640
01:08:29,215 --> 01:08:31,634
Where the fuck am I supposed to go, huh?

641
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,434
This will give you a chance.

642
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,895
A chance for what?

643
01:08:43,062 --> 01:08:45,982
Security out here is not as heavy as it should be.

644
01:08:46,148 --> 01:08:48,359
No one expects one of us to escape.

645
01:08:48,526 --> 01:08:50,277
We're here to fight.

646
01:08:50,444 --> 01:08:52,321
I'm going to break your chain.

647
01:08:52,488 --> 01:08:55,032
Make run to the forest. You know how to survive.

648
01:08:56,617 --> 01:08:59,912
- So, what, you my guardian angel now? - I'm no angel.

649
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:02,915
No. I'm gonna fight this fucking guy.

650
01:09:03,082 --> 01:09:06,460
- Not in your condition, it is not a true test. - I'm gonna fight.

651
01:09:06,627 --> 01:09:08,671
There is no honor in it.

652
01:09:08,838 --> 01:09:10,840
There's no honor in running.

653
01:09:11,215 --> 01:09:13,843
There's no honor in dying for money.

654
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:18,472
Well, I ain't gonna die, okay? Fuck that.

655
01:09:18,764 --> 01:09:21,892
I fucking lose, I just fucking go home. Back to square one.

656
01:09:22,059 --> 01:09:27,440
- Do like what I've been doing, fuck. No one goes home, not from here.

657
01:09:27,606 --> 01:09:30,109
The losing fighters all disappear.

658
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:34,530
No one gets out alive.

659
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:39,577
See?

660
01:09:41,287 --> 01:09:42,913
You don't have a choice.

661
01:09:44,415 --> 01:09:46,208
Fuck.

662
01:09:47,668 --> 01:09:52,923
Okay, all right, live to fight another day, right?

663
01:09:53,174 --> 01:09:54,842
Right. - Okay.

664
01:09:55,009 --> 01:09:56,510
Hey.

665
01:09:57,094 --> 01:09:58,971
They're gonna fucking kill you for this.

666
01:09:59,138 --> 01:10:02,141
No, they need me to fight.

667
01:10:02,308 --> 01:10:05,227
They will not destroy their final payday.

668
01:10:06,312 --> 01:10:09,774
Russia, why are you doing this?

669
01:10:11,192 --> 01:10:14,945
Stop asking so many fucking questions.

670
01:10:17,823 --> 01:10:18,908
Hit it.

671
01:10:19,825 --> 01:10:21,952
Come on, hit it. Harder.

672
01:10:22,828 --> 01:10:24,163
Hit it.

673
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:25,706
Hit it again.

674
01:10:25,873 --> 01:10:26,582
Damn it, hit it. Hit it.

675
01:10:26,582 --> 01:10:26,624
Damn it, hit it. Hit it.

676
01:10:26,624 --> 01:10:28,376
Damn it, hit it. Hit it.

677
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:30,002
Hit it, damn it, hit it.

678
01:10:59,073 --> 01:11:00,157
You motherfucker.

679
01:11:00,908 --> 01:11:02,284
I told you, motherfucker.

680
01:11:02,451 --> 01:11:06,038
I told you, motherfucker. I told you.

681
01:11:06,497 --> 01:11:08,582
Never fuck with me.

682
01:11:57,298 --> 01:11:58,549
Go.

683
01:12:04,221 --> 01:12:05,264
Go!

684
01:12:37,171 --> 01:12:43,135
You know, of all the fighters I expected would give us trouble...

685
01:12:43,302 --> 01:12:45,262
...you were the last on the list.

686
01:12:45,471 --> 01:12:49,809
- Where is the American? He'll be found and dealt with.

687
01:12:53,813 --> 01:12:55,356
I want to speak to Gaga.

688
01:12:57,858 --> 01:13:00,611
He has requests now.

689
01:13:00,778 --> 01:13:04,573
Do you think Gaga or anyone else can help you?

690
01:13:04,991 --> 01:13:10,621
- You think Gaga gives a shit about you? - He gives a shit about his money.

691
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:11,914
And that's what I am.

692
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,584
I would not be so sure about that.

693
01:13:16,877 --> 01:13:17,920
What does that mean?

694
01:13:18,379 --> 01:13:21,549
It means there's been a change of plans.

695
01:13:27,013 --> 01:13:29,640
I made a new wager, Boyka.

696
01:13:30,891 --> 01:13:32,893
Sorry, my friend.

697
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,856
You just can't beat the Colombian, not with your knee.

698
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,566
You are with these animals?

699
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:40,818
I'm with the money.

700
01:13:40,985 --> 01:13:42,194
I'm always with the money.

701
01:13:42,778 --> 01:13:45,990
We have been forced to improvise.

702
01:13:46,157 --> 01:13:49,952
You will now fight the Colombian in the final.

703
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:54,540
What will ye give me?

704
01:13:54,999 --> 01:13:57,126
And I will deliver him unto you.

705
01:13:58,669 --> 01:13:59,712
Excuse me.

706
01:14:01,213 --> 01:14:02,923
You fucking Judas!

707
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:07,345
Okay. Okay, I'm a fucking Judas.

708
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:11,182
Now, that makes you what?

709
01:14:11,766 --> 01:14:14,644
- Jesus? - No.

710
01:14:15,686 --> 01:14:17,229
That makes me angry.

711
01:14:28,449 --> 01:14:30,576
Boyka. Dolor.

712
01:14:36,123 --> 01:14:39,877
Announcing the championship final of the Prison Spetz Competition.

713
01:14:40,044 --> 01:14:43,047

...in any currency worldwide.

715
01:14:52,139 --> 01:14:55,977
Ladies and gentlemen, in our final fight...

716
01:14:56,143 --> 01:14:57,937
...Boyka of Russia...

717
01:14:58,104 --> 01:15:03,484
...versus Dolor of Colombia.

718
01:15:13,411 --> 01:15:14,954
Are you ready?

719
01:15:15,162 --> 01:15:16,747
Are you ready?

720
01:15:16,914 --> 01:15:18,416
Fight.

721
01:17:31,465 --> 01:17:34,010
FARNATTl: We got him, we got him. - It's not over, it's not over.

722
01:17:39,974 --> 01:17:41,809
FARNATTl: Look, he's hurt.

723
01:18:08,753 --> 01:18:11,380
Ahh. Yes.

724
01:18:21,349 --> 01:18:23,726
Come on, come on, huh?

...Boyka.

744
01:20:57,612 --> 01:20:58,943
Huh?

745
01:21:10,434 --> 01:21:12,311
Boyka.

746
01:21:13,688 --> 01:21:15,481
Boyka.

747
01:21:26,075 --> 01:21:27,827
Bravo.

748
01:22:05,781 --> 01:22:07,116
Boyka.

749
01:22:08,993 --> 01:22:10,286
Boyka.

750
01:22:10,453 --> 01:22:14,832
- Boyka, Boyka, Boyka. Boyka.

751

Stop, stop, stop, stay right there.

The winner from Russia is Boyka.

759
01:25:04,293 --> 01:25:09,757
"I guarantee you," huh? "I absolutely guarantee it. "

760
01:25:09,924 --> 01:25:12,593
You ancient fuck.

761
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,846
You just cost me $5 million, Rezo.

762
01:25:16,055 --> 01:25:18,224
I'm gonna eat your brain with a spoon.

You fucked up.

766
01:25:46,293 --> 01:25:47,920
I don't know how this happened.

767
01:25:48,129 --> 01:25:49,422
I don't give a rat's ass how.

768
01:25:49,588 --> 01:25:52,341
All I know, I'm out a shitload of money that I don't have.

769
01:25:52,508 --> 01:25:54,468
And you're gonna have to come up with it.

770
01:25:58,764 --> 01:25:59,932
Die.

771
01:26:26,584 --> 01:26:28,127
You did well, Mr. Boyka.

772
01:26:28,294 --> 01:26:30,921
I don't want your fucking prize.

773
01:26:31,088 --> 01:26:32,506
Just show me the front door.

774
01:26:33,174 --> 01:26:35,009
Yes, well, about that....

775
01:26:35,176 --> 01:26:36,302
About what?

776
01:26:36,677 --> 01:26:39,347
I'm afraid we have a problem.

777
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:41,641
You see, the agreement of this tournament...

778
01:26:41,849 --> 01:26:44,101
...was that one man would receive his freedom.

779
01:26:47,229 --> 01:26:49,482
You're talking about agreements now?

780
01:26:50,066 --> 01:26:52,860
Unfortunately, we have not recovered the American.

781
01:26:53,486 --> 01:26:55,863
And since you're responsible for his escape...

782
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:59,575
...I'm afraid you have forfeited your chance to leave here a free man.

783
01:27:00,076 --> 01:27:03,913
Anyway, you're not walking free out of this facility.

784
01:27:04,372 --> 01:27:07,416
Indeed, you're going right back to the toilet you came from.

785
01:27:11,003 --> 01:27:13,631
I did what I had to do.

786
01:27:16,884 --> 01:27:18,844
Where I go now...

787
01:27:20,012 --> 01:27:21,305
...I don't care.

788
01:27:21,806 --> 01:27:26,310
Good, then you'll not annoy me with any resistance.

789
01:27:26,769 --> 01:27:28,813
A bus is waiting outside.

790
01:27:49,542 --> 01:27:53,462
I will give you this, you're quite a fighter.

791
01:27:53,921 --> 01:27:56,007
Quite a fighter.

792
01:27:56,173 --> 01:27:58,801
Too bad you're such damaged goods.

793
01:27:58,968 --> 01:28:01,721
I have already arranged to have you picked up.

794
01:28:01,929 --> 01:28:03,139
Pity about your freedom.

795
01:28:04,098 --> 01:28:05,683
This is my freedom.

796
01:28:28,956 --> 01:28:30,416
You fucked with the wrong nigga.

797
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,464
Let's go.

798
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,050
Why did you do this?

799
01:28:39,216 --> 01:28:43,054
Stop asking so many fucking questions.

800
01:28:43,596 --> 01:28:45,473
Where are we going?

801
01:28:47,391 --> 01:28:49,477
God, it's good.

802
01:28:58,944 --> 01:29:00,613
Open it.

803
01:29:00,821 --> 01:29:02,615
Go ahead, open it.

804
01:29:06,202 --> 01:29:08,037
It's your share.

805
01:29:08,579 --> 01:29:10,748
I put all my money on you.

806
01:29:10,915 --> 01:29:13,626
Oh, you know me, I'm all about money.

807
01:29:13,793 --> 01:29:19,173
And you, well, good knee, bad knee, no knee...

808
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:22,843
...you're still the best fighter in the world, especially when you're angry.

809
01:29:23,928 --> 01:29:27,765
Heh, heh. Fuck cholesterol, winning makes me hungry.

810
01:29:29,058 --> 01:29:31,978
You're a free man now. How does it feel?

811
01:29:35,898 --> 01:29:39,360
- You're going with him? - Yeah.

812
01:29:39,735 --> 01:29:42,655
- And your children? - Heh. Yeah.

813
01:29:45,533 --> 01:29:47,284
I must go. Stop the car.

814
01:29:48,744 --> 01:29:50,287
Okay.

815
01:29:58,296 --> 01:30:00,798

Yo, yo, yo, Russia, Russia, Russia.

816
01:30:04,302 --> 01:30:06,512
Look, you ain't got to thank me.

817
01:30:07,096 --> 01:30:08,889
Hell, I owed you.

818
01:30:09,056 --> 01:30:11,517
- You didn't owe me. - Yeah, I did.

819
01:30:11,892 --> 01:30:15,730
Where I'm from, there ain't shit for free.

820
01:30:16,981 --> 01:30:20,151
And where I'm from, everything was for free.

821
01:30:20,318 --> 01:30:22,570
And it was all shit.

822
01:30:24,363 --> 01:30:26,032
Any idea where you're gonna go, man?

823
01:30:30,036 --> 01:30:31,579
Mr. Turbo, I'm waiting.

824
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,124
Look, I better get out of here.

825
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,960
See you around, buddy.

826
01:30:39,128 --> 01:30:40,212
It's Yuri.

827
01:30:42,423 --> 01:30:45,426
My first name, it's Yuri.

828
01:30:51,599 --> 01:30:53,184
Jericho.

829
01:30:53,601 --> 01:30:56,228
- Jericho? - Yeah.

830
01:30:56,854 --> 01:30:57,938
I know, it's shit, huh?

831
01:30:58,214 --> 01:30:59,544
Heh.

832
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:03,861
You bring down the walls.

833
01:31:08,616 --> 01:31:10,242
It's a good name.

834
01:31:12,745 --> 01:31:14,246
Yeah.

835
01:31:15,456 --> 01:31:17,833
I guess today it is.

836
01:31:22,088 --> 01:31:23,089
My man.

837
01:31:26,425 --> 01:31:31,347
Oh, almost forgot, you and me, we got some unfinished business.
