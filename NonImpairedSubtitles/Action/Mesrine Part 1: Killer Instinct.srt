00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:10,019

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,207
Some events of this movie are based on fiction.
It's not possible to completely show...

4
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,908
complexity of a man's life,
which everybody perceives differently.

00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:05,830
Mesrine: Part 1 - Death Instinct

6
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,338
I was born maybe a half mile from here.

7
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:24,017
Go ahead, go.

8
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:26,624
- Did you let him in?
- Yeah.

9
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:53,705
<i>Algeria, 1959.</i>

10
00:05:57,307 --> 00:06:00,037
- I can't...
- Everything will be alright, brother.

11
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,112
Look at me, everything will be fine.
Think about your family.

12
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:12,597
Look at me.
Where is the bomb?

13
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:19,069
God won't help you.

14
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:26,246
- Stop! Let him go!
- Mind your own shit!

15
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:30,302
- Mesrine!
- I am gonna shake him up.

16
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,762
Talk...

17
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,714
Look at your brother.

18
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,947
Do you want a cigarette?

19
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:44,702
Don't tell them anything, they'll kill you anyway.

20
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:48,611
I like you, tell me
where is the bomb at?

21
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,430
Nobody has to suffer.

22
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:56,163
I tell you everything.

23
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:57,726
Don't tell them anything!

24
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,027
Jasmin!

25
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:05,374
- Where is the bomb?
- Say nothing!

26
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:09,378
- Don't tell them!
- Shut her hole!

27
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,945
Leave her alone! That's my sister!

28
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:15,891
<i>Stop!
Leave her alone!</i>

29
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:20,219
I play with her for a little bit.

30
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,807
Stop!
I kill you!

31
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,962
Kill them!

32
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,304
Shoot!

33
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:04,175
It's your duty!

34
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:12,747
No!

35
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:18,447
Where did you hide the bomb, you bastards?!

36
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:55,394
Father found you a job.

37
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:59,216
- Really?
  Yes.

38
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:05,083
- At the factory.
  Steelmill?  - Yes, right there.

39
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:13,129
Good factory. If you'll like it over there,
you'll have a good future.

40
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:20,480
Thank you.

41
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:29,851
Hey, where you at?

42
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,429
- Come down.
- Ok, i'll be right there.

43
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:46,234
I'll be right back.

44
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:49,772
- You haven't eaten anything. - Do you have any money?
  Yes, I do.

45
00:10:56,508 --> 00:11:00,866
- So, how was it with the guerilas?
- It was a piece of cake.

46
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:07,456
- How was Algeria?
- Good. I don't feel like talking about it.

47
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:12,769
- You have a nice ride. I see you're doing fine.
- I'm not complaining.

48
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,390
I'm doing some work, you know. It's good money.

49
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,091
- Tell me more about it.
- I'll tell you  everything about it.

50
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:23,141
- And where are we going?
- I asked where we are going?

51
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,865
- It's always so many people here.
- Always packed.

52
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,549
Let's go.

53
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:14,682
Ladies, how are you?

54
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:19,742
I came with my friend.
Take care of him.

55
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:22,038
We'll see.

56
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:26,618
Jacques, come here.

57
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:30,174
- He's handsome.
- I'll be having fun with Suzan.

58
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:35,383
- I'm Sarah.
- Sarah...

59
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:37,788
Haven't we met before?

60
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:46,159
- Are you in it for the money only?
- Yeah, only when i get paid.

61
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,510
You'll pay me.

62
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:52,511
You're very nice, but i won't let you go unless you pay me.

63
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:55,858
We'll see.

64
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:11,017
Hey guys.

65
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:14,492
- Where you been?
- Some of us have to work too.

66
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:20,918
- This is Major.
- This is my payout. Who's dealing?

67
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:30,436
- You wanna lift?
- I take a walk.

68
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:33,311
I'm completely broke.
Can i borrow for a cab?

69
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,867
- That's too much. - Are you sure?
- Yeah, thanks.

70
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:50,901
Listen these your "dirty jobs", could you let me in?  - Yes.

71
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,669
- Relax, just push harder.
- Ok.

72
00:14:16,804 --> 00:14:20,392
The safe is behind that bookshelf.

73
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:30,683
This one?

74
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:38,541
Look what i found.

75
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:44,451
- Check it out, so much money is here.
- What a catch.

76
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:51,105
Thieves!
What do you want here?

77
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:54,894
- Hello, are you the owners of this apartment?
- Yes. - Excellent.

78
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:57,750
Inspector Bernar... Romain Japlé.
The Police.

79
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:02,809
I must inform you that you've been robbed.

80
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:09,026
- And that's not all. Those scumbags
 turned your bedroom upside down.
- God!

81
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:12,349
- Calm down honey.
- Calm down madam. I'm sorry.

82
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,459
- We found this weapon at your place.
- Yes, this is my rifle.

83
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,836
I hope you have a permit for it.
Bring it to the police precinct as soon as possible.

84
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:26,728
- To be honest, i don't know  where it is...
- Daniel, did you take the fingerprints?   Yes, i did.

85
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:29,130
Get ready, we're going to laboratory.

86
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:32,470
- Eduard, come take a look.
- Go, i think missus will be shocked.

87
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:35,144
Quiet Marie, calm down.

88
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:38,346
- We'll be expecting you at the precinct tomorrow at 9.
- Ok, we'll be there.

89
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,729
Thank you.

90
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:46,463
- Listen, Do you still have these kinda jobs?
-  Sure, a plenty.

91
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,274
- Do you want me to introduce you to the boss?
  Who is it? - Guido.

92
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:55,919
Guido, this is my buddy Jacques Mesrine i talked to you about.

93
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:01,178
Jacques Mesrine?

94
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:07,874
- Paul told me a lot about you.
  Thanks.  - Sit down.

95
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:15,599
When are you going to stop bringing me these 
wandering dogs from the streets?

96
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,549
- It's not...  
- Are you talking about me?
- No, not you.

97
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,582
- I asked you something , Paul.
- And i asked you too, grandpa!

98
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,125
- What?
- Wandering dogs? You mean me?

99
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,865
What's pissing you off?

100
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:38,159
- I hope you have a big army behind you.
- My army is secret organization.

101
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,361
Everybody recognize it
and it attacks whenever it wants to.

102
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:46,351
You are just bragging, you old babbler.

103
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:49,283
- If you don't know how to socialize
  with older people, you shithead,

104
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:50,883
  then i will have to teach you some manners.

105
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:53,983
And what else would you like?

106
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:00,913
Are you looking for this?

107
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:07,364
That's what happens when you hug old people.

108
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:14,056
- Where is you respect?
- Okay, calm down.

109
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:26,276
Don't be afraid I'm not a sociopath.

110
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,632
- Yes.
- I see you're not dumb.

111
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,410
I give you an advice,

112
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:38,212
the kind you'll only get from a friend.

113
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:44,201
In our bussiness you can't win.
At the end of your career if you lucky...

114
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:45,943
you'll get this.

115
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:50,178
If you get out of  water dry...
Are you following me?

116
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,863
Thanks.

117
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,275
I take your advice to my heart.

118
00:18:57,966 --> 00:19:01,598
If you really consider me as a friend,

119
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,986
call me Jacques.

120
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:07,973
Of course Jacques, sure.

121
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:25,137
My Jacques. My lovely Jacques.

122
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,953
Do you wanna do it again?

123
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:32,776
I have a friend, but... if you'll pay me,
i'll work for you.

124
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:37,516
Have you lost your mind?
What are you blabbing about?

125
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:41,150
Who do you think i am?
Some sucker?

126
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:45,715
I don't need your services.
I'll manage without you.

127
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:52,154
Don't be so pissed.

128
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:57,610
- I like you, Sarah
- I like you too.

129
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:00,858
You must be careful how you talk to me.

130
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:05,095
Hi.

131
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,469
- Your boss called.
- What did he want?

132
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,022
He said you didn't come to work for a week.

133
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,895
- And what?
- What "what"?

134
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:19,292
Father have found you a good job
and that's the way you pay him back?

135
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,395
So what. What's your problem?

136
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:24,102
Leave me alone!

137
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:28,373
<i>Good man earns for his livelihood honestly!</i>

138
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:32,467
<i>Keeps his family together and has a respect for them.</i>

139
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:39,186
<i>Talk to your son!</i>

140
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:17,698
You know, Me and your mom, we don't want you to leave.

141
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,794
It's your house.

142
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:26,525
Your mom, your mom...

143
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:30,160
Speak for yourself for once.

144
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,675
What's going on with you, Jacqui?

145
00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:36,865
Jacques is tired of his father being henpecked.

146
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,831
And i am ashamed how you
collaborated with germans.

147
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:49,787
And one more thing, tell me one reason
why i should be proud of my father.

148
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:52,280
No, i didn't work for germans.

149
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:56,288
- I was forced to.
- Nobody forced you, dad!

150
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:59,283
The same way nobody forced me to go to Algeria!

151
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:03,372
My god, just tell me what's going on with you.

152
00:22:03,373 --> 00:22:05,758
Do you have any pride?

153
00:22:16,111 --> 00:22:18,738
Spain, 1960.

154
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:33,271
- It's nice here.
- I wouldn't lie to you.

155
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:35,007
These two are coming to greet us.

156
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,801
Excuse me.

Hey, Paul, how do you say kiss in spanish?

164
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,775
- Beso.
- Oh, kiss!

165
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:12,776
A little beso...

166
00:23:12,777 --> 00:23:18,074
- I want you "beso".
- No, please.

167
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:33,697
- I got to go.

168
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:37,741
Hey, man!

169
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:44,297

Hi.

171
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,825
Would you like to dance?

172
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:56,583
- In spanish you say  "bailar".
- Bailar? Great. So, would you like to "bailar"?

173
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,832
No.

174
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:01,051
Sofia, say yes.

175
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:05,052
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

176
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:20,126
- I'd like to dance, boy.
- Frenchmen don't dance.

177
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:54,653
Come to my room, number 10.

178
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:57,586
- No, no. - Why?
- No.

179
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:59,487
- Really?
- Yes.

180
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:04,492
I have never been with someone before.

181
00:27:07,555 --> 00:27:10,532
It's the first time.

182
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:14,284
- First time?
- Yes.

183
00:27:14,285 --> 00:27:19,260
Sofia...

184
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:55,918
Hey, Jacques!

185
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,713
It's time, let's go!

186
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:04,374
We got to go.
Move a bit faster.

187
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:23,088
Get in.

188
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:26,490
We're leaving.

189
00:28:31,114 --> 00:28:33,448
Bye!

190
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:40,959
Bye!

191
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:44,103
What can you do in weather like this?

192
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:47,088
Weather is not bothering me,
I work where it doesn't matter.

193
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:53,800
- What do you need the gun for?
- You don't carry the gun?

194
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:59,683
- No, I don't. If you do anything can happen.
- Is it here? - Yeah.

195
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:10,036
- Good evening!
- Good evening!

196
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:17,843
- Do you want something to drink?
- Give me whiskey. - Double.

197
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:25,504
- Is Sarah here?
- No, she's not but she'll be here soon.

198
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:30,304
Sarah is taken, but Mado is free.

199
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:32,469
Go!

200
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,443
I wouldn't take this one.

201
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:39,576
- Gentlemen, would you buy a lady a drink?
- Get lost!

202
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:43,123
- What if you'd show some respect for the lady?
- Beat it! Get lost!

203
00:29:43,124 --> 00:29:48,521
What's that about?
Are you serving faggots in your bar?

204
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:50,022
I told you to get lost!

205
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:54,856
Hey, you!

206
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:57,831
What kind of manners are these?

207
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,651
What's wrong?
Anyone else wants some too? Huh?

208
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:10,696
Jacques, What are you doing here?

209
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:13,081
Leave him alone!

210
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:17,342
- My poor boy. - What are you doing?
- Have you lost your mind?

211
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:23,404
- Are selling yourself because of him?
  Yeah. And you got a problem with it? He's my friend, ok?

212
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:27,616
You snake! Get out of here!
I didn't ask you for anything!

213
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,271
- My love.
- My nose...

214
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,188
- I'm so sorry.
- Sweet couple.

215
00:30:36,992 --> 00:30:38,880
Get out of here!

216
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:42,912
Get out!

217
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:59,700
I'm sorry, Sarah.

218
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:15,799
God!

219
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:47,191
Sit in back.

220
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,217
Your nose got bigger.

221
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:22,219
It's nothing.
And how's Sarah, is she alive?

222
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,205
Listen Jacques, i've made an agreement with Guido.
I let you have her.

223
00:32:35,183 --> 00:32:40,108
I fixed her smile a little bit .

224
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:55,044
Ahmed, that's nice suit.

225
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:58,737
- It's a classic. Isn't it Guido?
- A classic suit.

226
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:03,495
- Is excellent. - Oh, yeah.
- I look in it like a real frenchman.

227
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,970
Frenchman?

228
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:14,067
You know how they call an Arab in suit like this?

229
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:18,278
- Do you know it, Guido?
- No, I don't know.

230
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:22,380
They say, "defendant , stand up!"

231
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,901
good joke.

232
00:33:31,902 --> 00:33:36,607
Jacques, do you know what they call Arab in ashtray?

233
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:38,575
No.

234
00:33:38,576 --> 00:33:41,440
A wastefulness. Three of them would fit in it.

235
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:57,008
Good joke.

236
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:02,052
- We're just joking.
- Don't be afraid.

237
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:07,033
- We are not like that.
- No, we are not.

238
00:34:41,884 --> 00:34:45,725
You son of bitch.
I spit on people like you!

239
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:51,140
Guido,  i gave you a word of a man.
I promised you!

240
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:54,237
- Your arab word is worth a shit!
- Shut up!

241
00:34:54,238 --> 00:34:57,708
Shut up!

242
00:34:57,709 --> 00:35:04,036
- Come here so i can see you better.
- Look, he whiffs like girl. - Shut your hole!

243
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:13,581
I would put bullet in a man's head,
but an animal like you, i finish off with knife!

244
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:19,758
Did you want to sell Sarah!
For how much?

245
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:44,844
Die you asshole!

246
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,289
Well, what you got?
Flesh.

247
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,030
- What's that?
- That's not important.

248
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:57,713
- Jacques, did you get married?
- Yes, I did.

249
00:36:58,131 --> 00:37:00,013
- Are you married?
- I am.

250
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:04,171
Heard that, Guido?
He got married.

251
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:10,616
- She's pregnant.
- He got married because she is pregnant. Bravo.

252
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:16,003
Enough.

253
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:20,022
Hey, are you gonna serve me finally?
Pour drinks! Bitch!

254
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:24,134
Move your ass! What are you doing?
Pour drinks!

255
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:27,811
Hey, guys, what's the problem?

256
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,852
And who are you?
Son of this bitch or the owner?

257
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:34,277
Please, serve them.

258
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:38,812
move your ass!

259
00:37:40,854 --> 00:37:43,102
Well, you see.

260
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,609
Nothing's happening. Keep playing.
Everything is okay.

261
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:07,121
This for disrespect
and this for your drinks.

262
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:16,370
- Does it always take so long?
- Depends.

263
00:38:16,371 --> 00:38:19,880
- 8-10 hours, depends.
- That long?

264
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,288
Depends, maybe even longer.

265
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:42,060
- When you become father, maybe you'll settle down. 
- Maybe.

266
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:45,823
Lot of things change with time but me.

267
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,826
- Only a few people change.
- It's true.

268
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:54,044
- Do you remember Skazatov?  - Who is he?
- You shot him in his knees, that guy.

269
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:57,520
Oh, Skazatov, i remember.

270
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:02,223
And what about him?

271
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:07,910
A couple days ago he came with two buddies and was asking about you.

272
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:11,278
Were they tough guys?

273
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:15,701
Yes they were.

274
00:39:15,702 --> 00:39:21,362
But without my approval they won't do anything to you.

275
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:27,564
Really? So it's cool.

276
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:33,629
What are they doing over there?

277
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:37,159
A child.

278
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,461
- Mister Mesrine?
- It's me. Guido, finally.

279
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:47,908
You have a beautiful daughter.

280
00:39:50,553 --> 00:39:52,781
You the man.

281
00:39:52,782 --> 00:39:56,159
- How are you?
- She's beautiful.

282
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,180
Hi.

283
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,238
What happened?

284
00:40:27,516 --> 00:40:33,506
- Were you out with buddies and whores?
- Yeah, you're right.

285
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,058
Wait.

286
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,908
Let me finish it.
Yeah, i was with my buddies.

287
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:46,876
- How about whores?
- Whores?

288
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:47,877
Whores.

289
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:52,951
why would i need whores when i have a woman like you?

290
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:23,156
That bank looks great. Only two tellers work there,
but most importantly there's no safe.

291
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:26,465
These morons keep money
under regular lock.

292
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:29,517
Jacques, it's a walk in the park.

293
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:32,639
- And you don't want to do it?
- No.

294
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,019
- Why?
- Because i'm going with Guido.

295
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,233
- I don't have any choice and you know that.
- That bank can be easily robbed.

296
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:42,997
Get in, get out, the same way bunnies fuck.

297
00:41:44,564 --> 00:41:48,670
- Yeah, as long as bunnies won't get fucked by someone else.
- Yeah.

298
00:41:53,337 --> 00:41:57,211
To bunnies!
I do it!

299
00:41:58,323 --> 00:42:02,403
<i>Prison d´Evreux, 1962.</i>

300
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:01,538
- How are you?
- Dad.

301
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:04,815
Did she say "dad"?

302
00:43:06,343 --> 00:43:10,656
My little girl. Dad.

303
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:16,426
She said it.
I'm dad.

304
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,103
Your daddy.

305
00:43:19,104 --> 00:43:22,287
She said it for the first time.

306
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,582
Jacques...

307
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:31,593
I don't know what to do.

308
00:43:31,594 --> 00:43:37,805
- What do you mean?
- I phoned your parents and they said...

309
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,924
i should go back to Spain.

310
00:43:42,925 --> 00:43:46,249
What kinda crap is this? Is this why you came here?

311
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,250
To look at me and tell me you're taking my daughter away from me?

312
00:43:51,911 --> 00:43:58,351
Sofia, look at me.

313
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:01,789
Do you want to tell me that?

314
00:44:04,677 --> 00:44:09,134
I love you...

315
00:44:11,423 --> 00:44:13,413
...you're my wife.

316
00:44:13,414 --> 00:44:16,600
I need you a lot.

317
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:20,705
Phone my parents,
they'll help you out. Sofia...

318
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,458
For them you're like their own daughter.

319
00:44:26,253 --> 00:44:29,336
- Will you phone them?
- Yes, I will.

320
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:37,155
This is my mom. Mom.

321
00:44:37,156 --> 00:44:40,225
She's a beauty your mom.

322
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:53,463
I just got out of jail. I'm not ashamed to say
 i was there for robberies.

323
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,409
And the reason I don't have any references 
it's simply because...

324
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,400
my life was on the edge since i came back from army.

325
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,298
And right here I'd like to  start fresh from zero.

326
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:11,422
I'm doing this because of my parents, my wife
and of course for myself.

327
00:45:11,623 --> 00:45:13,770
But most importantly for little daughter because...

328
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:15,571
... i have a little a daughter.

329
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:20,949
You know, your past is not helping you.

330
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,381
But at the same time i feel your honesty.

331
00:45:27,146 --> 00:45:30,976
You can start work tomorrow.

332
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:35,017
- Really?
  Yes.  - Thank you.

333
00:45:35,018 --> 00:45:37,605
- I'll show you where you'll work.
- Sure.

334
00:45:37,606 --> 00:45:40,805
This way, please.

335
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:44,041
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

336
00:45:45,674 --> 00:45:49,128
Jacques, your little Bruno is a cutie.
Doesn't he cry during the night?

337
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:53,214
Only rarely, but that's pretty normal.

338
00:45:53,215 --> 00:45:56,867
- Does he cry?
  No. - You're sweet.

339
00:45:56,868 --> 00:46:02,405
- Just wait when his teeth start coming out...
- Anyway, we'll see.

340
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:07,231
- I adore kus-kus.
- You know what, you should open a restaurant.

341
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:11,580
- You're good cook.
- Besides, he already has a job with a good pay.

342
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:15,856
- We don't miss anything.
- Don't get excited.

343
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:19,749
Sofia, come to me, honey.

344
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:26,495
- Good night.
  Good night.  - Bye, bye.

345
00:46:29,115 --> 00:46:37,520
I have a job for you.
You wanna make some money?

346
00:46:37,521 --> 00:46:39,840
No, i don't.

347
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:42,666
- No?
- No, i don't want to.

348
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:47,219
Because of Sabrine and Bruno.
I live and support myself honestly.

349
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,591
Alright we'll discuss it any other time.

350
00:46:53,106 --> 00:46:55,359
Let me know.

351
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:03,951
- Jacques, you got a minute?
- Yeah, i do.

352
00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:09,436
- I have serious problems.
- Like what?

353
00:47:09,437 --> 00:47:12,228
I'll have to fire somebody.

354
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,859
- But above all...
- I get it.

355
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,136
- Wait...
- It's alright.

356
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:23,825
- Last one to come, first one to go.
- I haven't decided yet.

357
00:47:23,826 --> 00:47:29,153
- Don't make anything out of it, you're good man.
- Don't worry because of me.

358
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:41,060
- So, i'm ready.
  Let's go.   - Jacques?

359
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,445
- Jacques, where are you going?
- Everything's ok. I'm going out with my buddies.

360
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:49,348
What buddies?
You said you're done with it.

361
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:53,610
- Listen to me! 
- You listen to me! I don't have time for this now.

362
00:47:53,611 --> 00:47:56,417
- You promised me that you won't hang out with them anymore. 
- That's history.

363
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:59,352
Go back to them and
that whore too!

364
00:47:59,353 --> 00:48:02,282
- And what's bothering you?
- Why can't you just stay home?

365
00:48:02,283 --> 00:48:05,159
This is the home of my parents!
I lost my job!

366
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,402
- I don't care whose home is it!
- Quiet! You wake up Bruno!

367
00:48:09,403 --> 00:48:12,635
If you leave, I'll call cops!

368
00:48:17,456 --> 00:48:20,474
What did you say?

369
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:23,348
Say it again! Repeat what you just said!

370
00:48:24,645 --> 00:48:28,540
Don't you ever say these words again, ok?

371
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:40,760
- Come here! Open the mouth!
- So, kill me!  - Open your mouth!

372
00:48:46,762 --> 00:48:53,101
If i should choose between my 
buddies and you, i'd choose them.

373
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:55,842
Remember that.

374
00:48:55,843 --> 00:48:58,551
Mom!

375
00:49:03,912 --> 00:49:07,097
Take care of daughter.

376
00:49:15,582 --> 00:49:20,662
Fat Guido.
You think i can't recognize you through the mask?

377
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:27,775
You're ridiculous.

378
00:49:27,776 --> 00:49:31,035
- Yeah, sure.
- The guy you're getting these papers for...

379
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:32,836
is already dead.

380
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,434
- You asshole.
  Looser. - Shut up!

381
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:38,604
Who sent you?

382
00:49:38,605 --> 00:49:41,115
- Chevallier?
- Shut up!

383
00:49:41,116 --> 00:49:43,317
This is your end.
You're finished.

384
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:45,878
You've reached your goal.

385
00:49:47,277 --> 00:49:49,617
I found them.

386
00:49:54,895 --> 00:49:59,173
- Why did you do it?
  Mind your own shit. Any other questions?

387
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:03,394
- You killed unarmed man!
- Do you recall how you put the gun in your wife's mouth.

388
00:50:03,395 --> 00:50:05,383
That's something different.

389
00:50:07,026 --> 00:50:09,154
I break.

390
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:15,916
- Do you bet more or you wanna take a break?
- Time, time, time...

391
00:50:17,938 --> 00:50:21,728
You don't need me to give you an advice.
You'll figure it out yourself.

392
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,861
- Here!
- Why are you throwing away your wedding ring?

393
00:50:35,862 --> 00:50:39,549
- She has abandoned us. Me and three kids.
- What?

394
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,736
Yeah.

395
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:46,928
- Really?
  Yeah.   - Good.

396
00:50:46,929 --> 00:50:51,258
You think this is more than three?

397
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:53,947
Doesn't matter. Fuck Sofia.

398
00:50:55,565 --> 00:51:03,388
So, Who is the best?
Your friend Paul won everything.

399
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:34,339

400
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:48,602
- Handsome, are you gonna buy me a drink?
  He can't, he's here with me.

401
00:51:50,062 --> 00:51:52,003
okay then.

402
00:52:05,965 --> 00:52:07,909
Thanks.

403
00:52:09,057 --> 00:52:12,711
- What's your name?
- Jeanne.

404
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:17,150
Jeanne? Funny.
And I am Tarzan.

405
00:52:21,577 --> 00:52:26,896
- My real name is Jacques.
- My pleasure Jacques.

406
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:31,838
- What do you want to drink?
- I thought it's customary for a gentleman to ask this question.

407
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:34,686
Traditions need to be changed.

408
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:39,186
- I try. I'm ready for everything.
- Me too.

409
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,918
Really?

410
00:52:42,919 --> 00:52:45,306
Yes.

411
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:52,266
- Quiet! Nobody moves!
- Everybody put your hands on the table!

412
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:56,821
- Quickly, all of you hands on the table!
- I said, hands on the table!

413
00:52:56,822 --> 00:53:00,124
Hey, calm her down!

414
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:03,995
Move, hurry, hurry!

415
00:53:05,713 --> 00:53:07,787
What's your problem?!

416
00:53:11,203 --> 00:53:13,357
- I said, quiet!
- Quiet!

417
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,534
- Quick, move!
- Jacques...

418
00:53:17,806 --> 00:53:20,212
- now you're stealing from me?
  Do you have a problem with it?

419
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:26,115
- You won't get too far.
- Don't worry about me.

420
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,455
I have what i want.

421
00:53:30,852 --> 00:53:33,688
Here is a tip.

422
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:45,169
- Dad, why isn't it working?
  Sweetie,

423
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:49,132
because the ball and the racket must be this way.

424
00:54:05,068 --> 00:54:09,263
- Are you alright?
 Dad, does it hurt? - No, it's nothing, honey.

425
00:54:09,264 --> 00:54:11,941
I'm only injured.

426
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:14,741
- I love you dad.
- I love you too.

427
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:27,002
In front of my daughter!
What the hell is it!

428
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:31,145
Will you stay together? Do you still want 
to be with him?

429
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:34,314
- To the end.
  Yes, of course.

430
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:40,705
If you love this woman, run away with her
and come back when everything settles down.

431
00:54:40,706 --> 00:54:43,379
Do you really mean it?

432
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,835
You think they won't go after us once we cross the border?

433
00:54:46,836 --> 00:54:51,730
The police is trying to get you,
i won't help you with that.

434
00:54:51,731 --> 00:54:55,053
Yeah, but they were shooting at my daughter!
I guess there are some rules!

435
00:54:55,054 --> 00:55:00,839
What rules?! In this bussiness
there's only one rule, rule of the jungle.

436
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,743
Everything has principles and moral laws.

437
00:55:03,744 --> 00:55:07,546
Get ready.
It will hurt.

438
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,318
Don't twist, I almost had her.

439
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:25,121
Guido!

440
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:32,043
 Remember in the future,
this is being used for killing people!

441
00:55:33,906 --> 00:55:35,814
Good.

442
00:55:51,276 --> 00:55:53,521
Let me, i'll help you out.

443
00:55:53,522 --> 00:55:56,455
Bye mom.

444
00:55:56,456 --> 00:56:01,021
- Come to me.
- Bye dad.

445
00:56:02,422 --> 00:56:05,893
- My love.
- Be back soon.

446
00:56:47,847 --> 00:56:50,776
<i>Montreal, 1968.</i>

447
00:57:00,566 --> 00:57:02,561
More, more, more!

448
00:57:04,577 --> 00:57:06,663
Good!

449
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,546
You're doing pretty good for a Frenchman.

450
00:57:45,547 --> 00:57:48,784
It seems you are not from around here.

451
00:57:48,785 --> 00:57:51,623
How long have you been here?

452
00:57:52,939 --> 00:57:54,403
A month or two.

453
00:57:55,418 --> 00:57:57,660
Do you like this job?

454
00:57:58,984 --> 00:58:02,365
I was doing better back in France.

455
00:58:02,366 --> 00:58:04,533
What was your job?

456
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:15,994
I was robbing banks.
My name is Jacques Mesrine.

457
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:18,551
And yours?

458
00:58:18,552 --> 00:58:21,355
Jean-Paul Mercier.

459
00:58:21,356 --> 00:58:24,126
I'm helping to finance a thieves.

460
00:58:25,332 --> 00:58:28,066
Pefect job in Quebec.

461
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:33,035
- Pleased to meet you.
- You too.

462
00:58:37,923 --> 00:58:44,267
Because of your criminal past I have to deny 
your residence application.

463
00:58:44,268 --> 00:58:48,480
You have 10 days to leave Canadian territory.

464
00:59:04,161 --> 00:59:05,811
Dear.

465
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:08,148
How did it go at the immigration?

466
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:14,369
Good, but we need more time.

467
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:19,217
Next week you don't have to go back to construction job.

468
00:59:19,218 --> 00:59:22,742
- Why?
- I replied  to an ad from some millionaire.

469
00:59:22,743 --> 00:59:25,743
He's looking for a driver.
We'll go for an interview.

470
00:59:27,392 --> 00:59:31,101
- Will you be working for him too?
  Yes, I always want to be with you.

471
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:57,336
Mr. Davallier. Mrs. Schneider
and Mr. Mesríne are here.

472
00:59:57,337 --> 00:59:59,328
Come in, please.

473
01:00:02,806 --> 01:00:08,288
- Welcome.
- So it's you, Jacques and Jeanne.

474
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:11,044
My guardian angels.

475
01:00:12,459 --> 01:00:18,301
- I suppose that we are hired.
- And you have my blessing too, my son.

476
01:00:18,302 --> 01:00:23,243
So in that case, thanks dad.

477
01:00:39,282 --> 01:00:42,259
Let's go
one, two and three.

478
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,197
Are you alright?

479
01:00:45,198 --> 01:00:47,509
Slowly.

480
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,834
We are not in a hurry.

481
01:00:51,108 --> 01:00:53,771
Don't worry, i'm holding you.

482
01:00:55,826 --> 01:00:57,563
So where to, sir?

483
01:00:57,564 --> 01:01:00,438
- to Santlar street.
- Sure.

484
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:16,634


485
01:01:18,162 --> 01:01:20,074
Hello sir.

486
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,917
- Have you paid for the parking?
- I live here, here is my card.
- Good then, take care.

487
01:01:44,964 --> 01:01:46,215
Look.

488
01:01:46,216 --> 01:01:49,554
- This is from Jacques.
- From Jacques?

489
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:29,517
I'm telling you for the first and  the last time,
stop mingling in to my work.

490
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:32,848
- I don't want to see you here anymore!
- What? Are you going to complain?

491
01:02:32,928 --> 01:02:34,848
I've been working here for more than 20 years!

492
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:37,511
Just go!

493
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:41,695
- You'll see, you won't get out of this that easily!
- Go, just go!

494
01:02:42,324 --> 01:02:44,545
That's okay.

495
01:02:55,386 --> 01:02:58,314
My gardener gave me a notice.

496
01:02:58,315 --> 01:03:04,442
You talked to him with disrespect.
The whole altercation was provoked by you.

497
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:07,298
- That guy is just a nobody.
- Maybe he is,

498
01:03:07,299 --> 01:03:11,641
but he served me loyally for 20 years.

499
01:03:11,642 --> 01:03:14,585
And I only knew you for three months,

500
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:19,124
so with less regret i rather say goodbye to you.

501
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:23,483
- I'm giving two days to leave this house.
- Sure. Come, we're leaving.

502
01:04:05,072 --> 01:04:08,139
<i>Jacques, we have to talk!</i>

503
01:04:13,198 --> 01:04:15,371
<i>Jacques!</i>

504
01:04:17,205 --> 01:04:19,873
<i>- Jacquesi!</i>
- Damn! 

505
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:23,879
What?! What!

506
01:04:26,131 --> 01:04:31,309
- Why are you treating me like this?
  For disrespecting me, Georges.

507
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:35,068
- and for disrespecting my wife.
- Tell me...

508
01:04:36,354 --> 01:04:38,295
what do you intend to do with me?

509
01:04:38,296 --> 01:04:43,169
- Jacques?!
- What? At first, you've been so nice to us,

510
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:47,230
and then because of that idiot gardener,
you fired us!

511
01:04:47,231 --> 01:04:49,626
Are we some kind of scum?

512
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:55,150
You'll pay for this.
I'll teach you some respect!

513
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:58,416
- My brother will pay you.
- It's possible.

514
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:03,363
In the meanwhile let me watch the TV!

515
01:05:47,574 --> 01:05:51,251
Jacques!

516
01:06:27,355 --> 01:06:29,122
Help!

517
01:06:33,454 --> 01:06:37,065
- Hi  Jacques. This is Jean-Paul.
- What's up? 
- I don't think he'll come.

518
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:40,390
We'll see about that.
I'm done talking!

519
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:48,889
He thinks, he is gonna pull my leg.

520
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:52,909
That old fart didn't show up with the money!
He'll pay, you'll see Jeanne.

521
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,171
That's him.

522
01:07:32,736 --> 01:07:34,715
Shit!

523
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:53,648

524
01:08:33,927 --> 01:08:36,643
- What are we going to do, Jacques?  Look. 
- Shit!

525
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:42,228
I have to stop.

526
01:08:43,001 --> 01:08:45,020
Fine, stop.

527
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:48,100
Get ready!

528
01:08:49,665 --> 01:08:52,669

529
01:08:56,772 --> 01:09:00,608

530
01:09:00,643 --> 01:09:04,213

531
01:09:04,214 --> 01:09:07,014

532
01:09:07,015 --> 01:09:09,675
 No. It's too many of them.

533
01:09:09,676 --> 01:09:12,537

534
01:09:12,538 --> 01:09:16,132

535
01:09:16,133 --> 01:09:20,793

536
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:24,003

537
01:09:24,004 --> 01:09:27,374

538
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:33,209

539
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,589

540
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:57,103
THE END OF THE RUN FOR BONNIE SCHNEIDER
AND CLYDE MESRINE!

541
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:07,043
<i>  DESLAURIER'S KIDNAPPERS
AGREED TO THEIR EXTRADITION TO CANADA</i>

542
01:10:10,071 --> 01:10:15,500
- What do you say on your arrival to Quebec.
- Quebec? A very restricting country.

543
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:19,239
<i>BILLIONAIR DESLAURIER WILL
TESTIFY AT TRIAL</i>

544
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:24,140
Tell us, do you regret what you did?

545
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:25,934
No, i don't regret anything!

546

548
01:10:34,003 --> 01:10:35,683
One word!

549
01:10:36,384 --> 01:10:38,384
It doesn't matter what. Anything.

550
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:44,159
Long live Quebec!

551

- Hey, do you want take a picture or what?
- No.5933, for the first month you are not allowed to talk!

552
01:10:57,484 --> 01:11:00,482
I don't give a shit what i can't do.
I'm Jacques Mesrine. Stop pissing me off!

553
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:12,642
- No.5933, take it off from your face!
- I can't sleep with this light on!

554
01:12:14,186 --> 01:12:18,637
- Take it off from your face, no.5933!
- Leave me alone!

555
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:28,642
Stop! It's not neccesary!
Why?!

556
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:32,157
Why?!

557
01:12:54,048 --> 01:12:56,073
No! No!

No! No! No!

559
01:15:31,936 --> 01:15:38,349
Your stay in isolation is over.
Welcome at the prison with maximum security.

560
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:20,075
Forget about it, Frenchman.

561
01:17:22,453 --> 01:17:25,711
I've seen you on TV.

562
01:17:27,097 --> 01:17:29,898
Long live Quebec, right?

563
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:35,252
You think you can get through barb wire?

564
01:17:38,498 --> 01:17:43,544
Your friend Mercier is right there
where you've been tortured by Gottier.

565
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:51,508
- How is he?
- How could he be, he's barely alive.

566
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:59,541
See you soon, French.

567
01:17:59,576 --> 01:18:02,671
By the way, you looked more happier on TV.

568
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:14,578
Hey!

569
01:19:17,438 --> 01:19:20,119
- Nice to see you again.
- You too.

570
01:19:21,959 --> 01:19:24,622
Hey, hold on.
They're watching.

571
01:19:43,463 --> 01:19:46,561
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

572
01:19:49,597 --> 01:19:52,057
Do you know these two?

573
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:55,556
- Which ones?
- The fat one with buddy.

574
01:19:57,136 --> 01:20:00,643
That fat one is murderer.

575
01:20:00,644 --> 01:20:05,442
The other one, too.
He's suspected of killing the guard.

576
01:20:08,604 --> 01:20:10,268
Why? Are they causing problems for you?

577
01:20:11,804 --> 01:20:13,800
Right now, i don't know.

578
01:20:15,252 --> 01:20:19,351
I think I know how we'll escape from here.

579
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:22,299
We'll get through the fence.

580
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,442
During our walk in daylight?

581
01:20:27,651 --> 01:20:29,819
Do you have any other ideas?

582
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:34,378
Good, Jacques. 
When?

583
01:20:36,971 --> 01:20:40,246
By the fall you'll be either outside or
 you'll be dead.

584
01:20:41,746 --> 01:20:45,357
I'm for it. Death or freedom.

585
01:21:19,818 --> 01:21:22,981
Tell me honestly.
What do you want from me, Frenchman?

586
01:21:22,982 --> 01:21:29,220
- I need tools.
- What's in it for me?

587
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:33,179
I don't have anything to offer you.

588
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,811
Except a chance for freedom.

589
01:21:35,812 --> 01:21:39,938
If i'll manage to get out of here,
i'll take you with me. I'm giving you my word.

590
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:44,051
You're desparate, Frenchman.
I like it.

591
01:21:45,657 --> 01:21:48,487
- Let's go.
- See you.

592
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:52,403
Did he agree?

593
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:56,462
- What day is today?
- I know is monday.

594
01:22:06,497 --> 01:22:09,826
Jesus, Frenchman!
Do you want to get killed?!

595
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,973
But not here and not on monday.

596
01:22:25,945 --> 01:22:29,857
They are always watching,
except on monday after weekend hangover.

597
01:24:28,844 --> 01:24:30,697
Mercier, let's go.

598
01:25:13,457 --> 01:25:15,782
- Are you looking out?
- Yeah.

599
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,755
Hurry!

600
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:21,498
Don't worry, everything is ok.

601
01:26:27,002 --> 01:26:29,468
Stop! Or i'll shoot!

602
01:27:08,838 --> 01:27:10,310
Come on, let's get out of here!

603
01:27:36,623 --> 01:27:39,157
Everybody on the ground!
Face to the ground!

604
01:27:59,621 --> 01:28:03,288
<i>Today prisoners escaped from prison with maximum security.</i>

605
01:28:03,289 --> 01:28:07,921
<i>Until now this was considered impossible.</i>

606
01:28:07,922 --> 01:28:10,823
- Jean-Paul!
- What?

607
01:28:10,824 --> 01:28:13,751
- They talk about us.
- Leave me alone right now!

608
01:28:36,317 --> 01:28:39,109
- Jean-Paul!
  Give me two minutes, damn!

609
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:43,924
We're famous, Jean-Paul.

610
01:28:53,824 --> 01:28:57,418
Don't go out with your hands up
only if they'll capture both of us.

611
01:28:57,419 --> 01:28:59,687
They shoot at everybody, whoever moves.

612
01:29:01,677 --> 01:29:04,881
- We must be fast.
  How much time do we have?

613
01:29:04,882 --> 01:29:06,982
30 seconds.

614
01:29:08,945 --> 01:29:10,767
Not enough?

615
01:29:13,746 --> 01:29:15,486
- Do we have a choice?
- No.

616
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:29,501
I wanna see your hands!

617
01:29:29,502 --> 01:29:32,331
Quick on the floor!

618
01:29:32,332 --> 01:29:35,706
Don't move!

619
01:29:37,145 --> 01:29:39,884
Quiet!

620
01:29:39,885 --> 01:29:43,645
I said don't move!

621
01:29:43,646 --> 01:29:46,255
Don't move and nothing happens to you!

622
01:29:47,928 --> 01:29:51,306
I'm telling you, don't move!

623
01:29:52,701 --> 01:29:54,652
Jacques!

624
01:29:54,653 --> 01:30:00,329
Stay where you are!
10, 9, 8, 7,

625
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:11,803

We'll leave together and everything will stay behind us.

667

Don't do it, Jacques.
I don't want you to come.

685
01:40:23,787 --> 01:40:26,896
My hand is still weak.

686
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:38,102
Watch out.
