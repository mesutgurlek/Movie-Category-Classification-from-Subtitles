1
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,809
And this display is all 
that's left of control.

2
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,500
An ultra-secret
spy agency

3
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:26,691
which once battled against
the criminal syndicate known as KAOS.

4
00:02:27,663 --> 00:02:30,386
CONTROL was disbanneded
at the end of the Cold War.

5
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:32,746
Ok! Up next ...

6
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:41,350
Judy ... The elevator is still 
doing that thing where it drops really fast.

7
00:03:41,546 --> 00:03:43,046
Are you sure maintenance fixed that?

8
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:44,614
Let me check...

9
00:03:44,664 --> 00:03:46,054
Yep, they fixed it.

10
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,269
See you later...

11
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:52,631
Hey Max!

12
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,734
Agent 50 ...

13
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:57,744
16 floors down, how could
a fly get in here?

14
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:58,582
Hey Max!

15
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:00,191
Larabee, 91 ...

16
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:01,879
Yeah, big day!

17
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:04,367
It could be your last chance
to push a pencil.

18
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:06,073
Field Agent test results are due.

19
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,971
Oh, is that today?

20
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:09,897
I wasn't, uh, really thinking about it...

21
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:11,691
Can you imagine Max as an agent?

22
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,393
Lace up those shoes.

23
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:16,254
Uh-oh, two nerd pile up.
(Makes crash sound)

24
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:17,445
Move.

25
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:19,992
Pretty boys....

26
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:21,548
...nothing but empty suits.

27
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,159
Good morning Bruce.
Good morning Lloyd.

28
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,911
Why would you even want to be an agent?

29
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:25,893
I mean ...
Lab guys, like us,

30
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:27,415
Analysts like you ...

31
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:28,514
We're the real soldiers ...

32
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:30,022
We're the true guardians of
freedom and democracy.

33
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,427
And, uh, I hear we're getting
a new cappacino machine.

34
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,819
Nope, unfortunately that's only for agents.

35
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:36,115
Ohh ...

36
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:50,152
Hey! Agent 23 is back!

37
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:01,374
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

38
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:03,123
Welcome back 23!

39
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,741
Maxiee!

40
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,969
So how was the assasination?

41
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:07,508
Maxie you know assasinations are

42
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:10,209
specifically prohibited
by executive order 12333 ...

43
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:15,382
23, you kill me!

44
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,557
Ah, I could if I wanted to!

45
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,139
Yes you could.

46
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:19,581
Did you see that face he made?

47
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:21,674
Come here Maxie!
Scary.

48
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,190
6 months work.
18 million dollars.

49
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:29,351
Frickin' agents man...

50
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:35,839
A lot of chatter in this
region, involved nuclear material,

51
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:39,752
you may remember from
page 627 of my last report,

52
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,778
that there has been an uptick
in KAOS intrest in nukes.

53
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:47,109
To it, I offer
the following conversation ...

54
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,674
What are you doing?

55
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:49,460
Are you texting?

56
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:52,644
Yeah... just letting my fiancee know we
won't be able to get married in June...

57
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,100
Cause we'll still be in this meeting.

58
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:56,130
Can I see it for a second?

59
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:56,802
Yeah.

60
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:58,058
That's great.

61
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,356
That's weird,
you lost your signal ...

62
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,981
Sorry to interrupt Maxie.

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,766
Go ahead.

64
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:05,502
Next time, use
your own damn phone!

65
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:08,719
Good morning men!

66
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:10,867
No offense Karen.
Snappy tie.

67
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:11,725
Sorry I'm late,

68
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,374
but I just came out of a budget meeting

69
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:17,775
with our incredibly abrasive, dismissive,
and sarcastic and vice president.

70
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:18,857
It's no problem.

71
00:06:18,882 --> 00:06:23,767
I have obtained a snipit at great
risk, to a busboy in Ballat.

72
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:29,606
Azhab, how is your coffee?

73
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:31,936
Good, Dalip.

74
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,546
It's decaf.

75
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:35,550
How is yours?

76
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:38,172
It is good, also.

77
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,818
How is your muffin?

78
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,711
Powerful stuff...

79
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,737
So muffin then, is a code-word.

80
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:48,663
No! It is comfort food

81
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:51,857
and, quite frankly, much more
fattening than most people realize.

82
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:53,042
Which begs the question,

83
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:59,419
Why would two hardened
KAOS agents risk the carbs?

84
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,040
Because they are under a great deal of stress...

85
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:04,244
Hence the decaf.

86
00:07:04,286 --> 00:07:07,612
For Azhab yes, Dalip takes
his full strength. Why?

87
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:10,089
Because he has been sleeping
on the couch for 3 days,

88
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,590
because he called his sister-in-law...
a leathery hag.

89
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:16,679
You know, people often say
things they don't really mean.

90
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:20,576
Leathery hag...
Fat cow ... Ungrateful whore...

91
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:21,990
Just words really.

92
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,201
That shouldn't be used against you
in a custody hearing...

93
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:26,945
Let it go man.

94
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,985
The kids don't even look like you.

95
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,938
Can we put a pen in this please and go back
to Max's extrodinairly detailed report?

96
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:34,578
Thank you Chief.

97
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,513
All that I'm saying, is that
until we understand

98
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:38,314
that our enemies are
also human beings,

99
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:40,367
we will never be able to defeat them.

100
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:42,458
Yes, they are bad guys.

101
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:45,566
But that is what they do,
not who they are.

102
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:47,829
Let's continue listening

103
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:51,734
and bear in mind that the next
100 pages can get a little bit dry.

104
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:05,833
Easy Duran!

105
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:07,601
This stuff is radioactive.

106
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,818
One slip-up and its ka-freaking-boom!

107
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:10,430
Shtarker ...

108
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:13,222
This is KAOS.

109
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:15,684
We don't ka-freaking-boom here ...

110
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,883
Sorry Mr Siegfried.

111
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,304
Get it in the truck.

112
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:21,303
And let's burn this place to the ground.

113
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,245
But if we have what we want ...
Why burn the building?

114
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:32,942
Any more questions?

115
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,361
Missed me!

116
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,459
Alright!
Alright!

117
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:02,683
I'm out!

118
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,154
He was lying Max

119
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:04,947
Good shot!

120
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:05,879
Thanks.

121
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,025
I am so sick of training.
I want to get out on the field!

122
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:12,161
Give it up 23!
It's just you and Maxie pad against the 6 of us!

123
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:15,460
Oh gee, Maxie pad.
I've never heard that one before.

124
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,091
I never have actually heard that before...

125
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:26,318
23, you're bleeding.

126
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:28,368
Ahh ... it's a knife wound from the last mission.

127
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:30,060
When my blood gets pumping, it starts to seep.

128
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,458
Hey Maxine!

129
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:34,434
Why don't you come over here and
we'll play a little game I like to call:

130
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,430
"Let's go to the dog show."

131
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:38,988
I put a collar on you and
make you my bitch!

132
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:44,914
I think I really got inside his head!

133
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,096
I am not proud
of what I just did.

134
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:48,908
Game over Chatty Kathy!

135
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:56,566
Game over when I say its over.

136
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,587
Ok...

137
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:58,603
Wet willey.

138
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:01,804
Ok, who wants lunch?

139
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:02,507
Well,

140
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,895
Excellent work 23.

141
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:06,353
But I could have handled it my...

142
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,571
Max...

143
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,050
The Chief wants to see you.

144
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:10,955
It is nice to see you too!

145
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:19,854
You wanted to see me Chief?

146
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,578
Yes Max, yes.
Please... sit down.

147
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:26,251
Your field agent test results
just came in. And...

148
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:28,510
Something wrong with your ear?

149
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,661
Absolutely not...

150
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:31,724
Would you like me to wait
while you answer that?

151
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:33,272
Answer what?

152
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:34,093
Nothing!

153
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:35,110
You were saying?

154
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:37,239
I was saying that your
results were quite extraordinary!

155
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:41,017
In fact, your essay on
the existentialism was quite amazing!

156
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:42,349
I left that section blank.

157
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,332
Blank?

158
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:44,312
Brilliant.

159
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:45,661
Brilliant Max!

160
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:47,913
At any rate, you passed
with flying colors.

161
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:48,675
Yes!

162
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:49,795
You know what sir?

163
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,559
I can't say that I'm shocked, because
I felt very good about this year's test.

164
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:56,834
Especially in light of the fact that in
previous years my fitness has been an issue.

165
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:05,304
A personal best.

166
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:06,704
But not anymore!

167
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:08,053
I'm ready for duty.

168
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:11,293
Max... I know how hard you've prepared
for this, and how much this means to you...

169
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:13,834
But, uh, I'm afraid I can't promote you.

170
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,223
What?

171
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:18,099
I can't afford to
give up my best analyst.

172
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:21,130
I mean... the amount of
chatter you get through and your reports...

173
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,652
I mean, they go way beyond the raw data.

174
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,810
So...

175
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:29,646
To be clear, you are not promoting me
because I do such a great job.

176
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:31,328
Max...

177
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,895
The way you and I work has become
a lost art form...

178
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,401
Do you know that I spent half my days

179
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,435
trying to convince the Vice-President
that intelligence

180
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,536
comes from human beings
and not satellites?

181
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:42,956
Men with hunches that's where
the real work gets done.

182
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:45,207
I'm very proud of you Max!

183
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:46,792
Very proud of you...

184
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,634
And I need you where you are.

185
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,162
I am sorry, but we can never be.

186
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,182
Despite today's set back, I will
at some point, become a field agent ...

187
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:21,194
And when that happens,
one phone call

188
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:23,595
could take me to the other side of the world.

189
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:25,522
Who am I kidding?

190
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:28,216
I'm a middle-aged man who has missed the train.

191
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:30,165
You don't deserve this.

192
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:32,372
I don't deserve you...

193
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:34,455
You're so young, so full of life.

194
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,811
Don't it do Fang...

195
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:38,225
Don't love me.

196
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:43,526
Sorry.
Oh great.

197
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,455
That was my last mile and now
I have no idea how fast I was.

198
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:47,674
Well, you were really moving!

199
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,691
It's not easy to knock me down. I have a
very low center of gravity. Pretty solid.

200
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:54,571
I'm just going to call that one a... 4:50.

201
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:55,696
Impressive!

202
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:58,264
I, uh, once ran a 5:16.

203
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:00,467
Oh really?
That's uh, that's lower.

204
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,781
Well .. not everything is a competition.

205
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,294
-Well, if it were, I'd win!
-Ah!

206
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,051
Are you flirting with me?

207
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,768
Not at all!

208
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:09,977
Are you flirting with me?

209
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:11,068
It depends...

210
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:12,285
Is it working?

211
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:13,387
Not at all...

212
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:15,147
Well, nice meeting you!

213
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,804
I admire your focus!

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,114
Am I invisible?

215
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,896
Bruce, Lloyd!

216
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:58,426
What happened?

217
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,726
And what is that ungodly smell?

218
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:02,252
Fear...

219
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:05,122
I'll be back.

220
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:11,989
Freeze!

221
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:13,384
Freeze!

222
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:15,174
No, you freeze!

223
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:15,892
You freeze!

224
00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:17,724
-I told you to freeze!
-Freeze times infinity.

225
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,525
Oh my God!

226
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:20,794
You!

227
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:21,564
You!

228
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:22,354
Are you CONTROL?

229
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,726
I am Maxwell Smart.
I am an CONTROL analyst.

230
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:25,443
Who are you?

231
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,327
I'm Agent 99.

232
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:29,012
Oh...

233
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,980
...My...

234
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:30,667
...Word...

235
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,177
You are Agent 99?

236
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:34,091
I am a huge fan!

237
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:35,084
Thank you.

238
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:46,047
What are you doing?

239
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:48,930
I'm right here.
Just talk to me!

240
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:51,209
I'm going to cause a diversion
and you run and get help.

241
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:52,562
I really don't think that's a....

242
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:53,343
Shhht!

243
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:53,884
Did you just...

244
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:54,602
Shhhht!

245
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,174
Good 23 ... just in time!

246
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:29,621
I think I got one of them!

247
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:32,044
Is that the Chief?

248
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:35,125
Yes it is.

249
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,488
Sorry about that Chief...

250
00:15:37,706 --> 00:15:39,611
Is that a dent in his head?

251
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:56,343
Hi!

252
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:57,393
Hi!

253
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,487
Agent 13...

254
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,621
You are in a tree?

255
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:02,566
Yeah, communications got knocked down
so they put me in a tree.

256
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,547
Old school stuff.

257
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:05,648
I'm glad to see you're ok.

258
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:09,396
Well .. I have to get going.

259
00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:10,796
Would you raise up the walkway?

260
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:12,589
You don't have to get going.
You don't have to get going.

261
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:14,447
Yeah, I've got a meeting. So...

262
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:15,272
How have you been?

263
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:15,717
I've been well.

264
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:16,398
Everything good?

265
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:16,991
It's great.

266
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,960
Well, I've got uh...

267
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:19,724
Could you come back this way?

268
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,036
I... Yeah, yeah. I think I will.

269
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,344
What time?

270
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:26,056
Well...

271
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:27,666
Huum...

272
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:28,936
I get it.

273
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:32,676
Who wants to talk to
a guy in a tree?

274
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:33,947
I get it.

275
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,278
Hang in there.
Don't cry!

276
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,417
Don't, please don't cry.

277
00:16:57,927 --> 00:16:59,485
Ok Let's get started.

278
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:02,564
You'll have to bear with me,
I'm still a little fuzzy.

279
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,240
I got a pretty good hit
in the head yesterday.

280
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:07,179
Yes, it was dark in there...

281
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,639
You probably tripped.

282
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:09,831
I hurt my knee.

283
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:11,752
It was smokey too.

284
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:14,219
Alright!

285
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,070
Here's what we know...

286
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:15,776
Wait!

287
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:16,353
Chief...

288
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,568
I request a cone of silence.

289
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:20,295
Oh Max,
Not the Cone of Silence.

290
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,154
We're in a safe room,
for God's sakes!

291
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:24,033
We also thought that the
CONTROL was safe...

292
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,110
Ok...

293
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:25,793
Lloyd...

294
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,332
Ok.

295
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:33,348
We have reason to believe that our
security was breached by KAOS...

296
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:34,650
You have to speak up!

297
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:36,750
Can you hear me?

298
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:37,471
What?

299
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:38,557
Can you hear me?

300
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,107
What did you say?

301
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,475
Bruce, it's not working.

302
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:41,745
It's not working!

303
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:42,199
Ok!

304
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:43,126
It's not working!

305
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:46,481
Chief, I hit you in the head with a fire extinguisher.

306
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:47,929
No, no. We're not ready yet!

307
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:48,268
What?

308
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:49,051
Ok ..

309
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:49,812
Alright...

310
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:51,324
It doesn't work!

311
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:52,550
Turn it off!

312
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,233
Usless piece of garbage!

313
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:56,420
Hey Larabee...

314
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:57,727
You ok?

315
00:17:57,769 --> 00:17:59,450
Larabee wants out!

316
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:00,508
Ow!

317
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:01,618
What do I do?

318
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:06,623
We are going to get rid of this!

319
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:07,775
Ok.

320
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:12,527
Yep, I can hear now.

321
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,884
Sorry Chief.
Someone led me to believe,

322
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,860
the cone was ready.

323
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:18,454
For the record, I never actually
used the word "ready".

324
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:21,721
Show them the cone. They'll all go for the cone.
The cone was the shizzle. You said that.

325
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:23,082
Shut up now!

326
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,098
Listen up prople.

327
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:26,591
There has been a rash of thefts
of nuclear material,

328
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:29,355
especially yellow caked uranium,
over the last 3 months.

329
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:30,986
Now, based on Max's intel,

330
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,834
we were able to get Agent 38
inside KAOS.

331
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:35,541
We must have been close to
uncovering something big,

332
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,540
so KAOS hit us,
and they hit us hard!

333
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,414
During the confusion, they hacked our system

334
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:42,295
and learned the identities of
all of our field agents.

335
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:44,583
Around the world, our people are under attack.

336
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:52,427
Our only lead

337
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:55,357
is the maker of the bomb
that KAOS used against us.

338
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:56,951
Ladislas Kistivil.

339
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:57,879
It is pronounced...

340
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:58,600
Mr Krstic.

341
00:18:58,601 --> 00:18:59,048
Yes!

342
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:00,185
Ladislas Krastica ...

343
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:01,507
Krstic!

344
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:02,424
Kripblitz!

345
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:03,301
Yes.

346
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,544
He is a Bosnia national

347
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:07,356
and one of KAOS's
favorite munitions suppliers.

348
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:08,454
Unfortunately...

349
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:09,908
We make no idea where he is.

350
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:11,047
Actually sir, we do.

351
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:11,949
He is in Russia.

352
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,063
How do you know that?

353
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:15,117
It was on page 482 of my report.

354
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,158
Doesn't anybody read my reports?

355
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,538
Alright,

356
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:22,276
Our mission is clear people.

357
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:23,520
Find Kristas!

358
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:24,292
Krstic.

359
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:24,776
Yes!

360
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:25,300
Find him!

361
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:25,799
Kris...

362
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:26,781
Kringle.

363
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:27,789
Fish sticks.

364
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:29,177
Ok.
I got it. I got it. I got it.

365
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:31,062
Use him to get to KAOS,

366
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:33,111
then recover the stolen nuclear material,

367
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,210
before they can do
something less than friendly.

368
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:36,075
And maybe...

369
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,030
If we're lucky...

370
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:39,545
We can apprehend the man
behind it all...

371
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,486
Siegfried.

372
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:42,503
Pictured here with his number two man...

373
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:43,313
Shtarker.

374
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:46,041
But Chief, how are we going to do that when
all of our agents are already compromised?

375
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,308
Put me out there Chief!

376
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:48,945
I am not afraid to expose myself!

377
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,131
Do you ever think before you speak?

378
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:52,819
No.
I whip it out there.

379
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:53,800
That's what's best.

380
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:55,462
Fortunately, we have other options.

381
00:19:55,615 --> 00:20:00,066
99 recently underwent massive plastic surgery,
so her new face is not known yet.

382
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:01,732
We also have a new agent...

383
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,015
Agent 86.

384
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:04,603
Who is that sir?

385
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:06,071
It's you Max!

386
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:09,248
Alright Maxie!

387
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,292
You did it!

388
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,555
Lloyd may I have the C.O.S. please?

389
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,520
Oh, I'm so happy!
I'm so happy!

390
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:25,374
This is the best day of my life!

391
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:28,135
Max...

392
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:29,182
You...

393
00:20:29,274 --> 00:20:30,766
You didn't push the button hard enough.

394
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:31,880
So, you could hear me?

395
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:32,349
Yes...

396
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:34,805
Right....

397
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,624
Excuse me, Chief.
Just a thought.

398
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:38,143
I'm not questioning your judgement,

399
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:38,718
99!

400
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:40,327
I insist on complete honesty.

401
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:43,138
If you have something to say to me,
I wish you would just say it.

402
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:45,623
Max has no experience and I
don't want him as my partner.

403
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:48,231
Well, that is a sucker
punch to the gonads.

404
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:52,341
Hey Max!

405
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:55,411
We got you a lovely parting gift
for your first mission!

406
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,930
Oh, a pocket knife!

407
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,907
It's not just a pocket knife,

408
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,133
A Swiss Army Knife!

409
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:01,506
It comes with tweezers, pliers,

410
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:02,816
a tiny magnifying glass,

411
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:04,539
space scaler, saw, flame-thrower, chisel,

412
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

413
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,275
What was that thing you said two back?

414
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:07,794
Chisel?

415
00:21:07,837 --> 00:21:08,608
No, before that.

416
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:09,656
Did you say flame-thrower?

417
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:10,067
Yeah!

418
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:11,157
Check it!

419
00:21:13,427 --> 00:21:15,691
We also added a crossbow
that fires harpoons,

420
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:17,886
Connected to 60 feet
of spider-silk nano thread.

421
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:19,561
Has the strength of half inch steel cable.

422
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:21,647
It's a time consuming, labor intensive technology!

423
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:23,888
The spiders have to be individually milked...

424
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:25,984
And they do not like it...

425
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:27,522
No,
They don't.

426
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:28,854
Gentlemen!

427
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,271
You are the best!

428
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:31,138
Thanks.

429
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:50,938
(Over PA)
Ladies and gentleman, we ask you to
please keep your seatbelt fastened.

430
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,983
I feel really good about us as partners.

431
00:21:55,604 --> 00:21:57,484
23 said that's important.

432
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,092
Trust is a must.

433
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:00,594
That's what 23 says.

434
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:03,921
-Does he?
-You and I are share a bond.

435
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:05,001
I think,

436
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:08,597
We both know what it feels like to look
in the mirror and not like what we see.

437
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:11,269
You with the surgery, me with the weight loss...

438
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,626
I want to show you something.

439
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:18,773
That was me...

440
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:19,642
Wow!

441
00:22:19,864 --> 00:22:20,730
Impressive!

442
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,380
Congratulations!

443
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:23,895
Thank you.

444
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,929
This is...

445
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:29,515
Me!

446
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:31,143
Wow!

447
00:22:32,223 --> 00:22:33,614
Very impressive 99!

448
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:36,074
You were truely hideous!

449
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,174
Back then...

450
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:42,160
Any way, since we are going to
be portraying husband and wife,

451
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,371
Maybe we should get our story set.

452
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,269
Ok. Good idea.

453
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:50,092
We met at a marketing
convention in Vegas.

454
00:22:50,173 --> 00:22:52,472
Married a year later.
No kids.

455
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:54,308
I like your parents,
but you hate mine.

456
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:55,715
Do we want kids?

457
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:58,782
Well, you do. But,
I'm concentrating on my career.

458
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,387
Well, I don't know if that's fair.
I mean, I'm older than you are.

459
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:02,937
Well, not by much.

460
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,054
Really?

461
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:08,916
When they gave me a new face,
I had them, um....

462
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,607
Take a couple years off.

463
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:13,628
You know, why not!

464
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:17,684
Well, if that's the case,
then you are at an advanced age...

465
00:23:18,923 --> 00:23:20,571
-You should...
-No, I was never...

466
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:24,097
No, I am just saying
that your eggs could dry up and...

467
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:25,670
fall out of your uterus. So,

468
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:27,216
Time is the essence.

469
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:30,029
That's your opinion.

470
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,545
No,
That is a medical fact!

471
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,033
There is a lot of time for
me to make this decision.

472
00:23:34,158 --> 00:23:36,767
And I don't want to be rushed
into it by you, or my mother!

473
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:39,057
-You don't have to...
-Where is the damn drink cart?

474
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:45,007
-Uh Oh...
-What?

475
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,250
6 O'clock.

476
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:48,940
Don't turn around.
Don't turn around!

477
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:50,432
Use your peripherals...

478
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:56,452
-Do you see him?
-No...

479
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,725
I'm just widening my eyes,
I'm not actually seeing anything more!

480
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:03,487
The big, scary guy that might as well
be holding up a sign that says,
"Hi, I'm an assassin, I'm here to kill you."

481
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,653
Ok, 99. You know what?
That is profiling.

482
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,796
Just because he is large, doesn't
necessarily man that he is a bad guy.

483
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:11,946
I mean,

484
00:24:12,836 --> 00:24:13,596
Ohh!

485
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:15,049
Wow!

486
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:19,029
That's a bad guy.
That's a really bad guy!

487
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,320
-You don't say?
-Did you see his face?
-Yes.

488
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:24,259
His head, looks like one of
the Easter Island heads.

489
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:29,088
You know what? I'm doing the same thing.

490
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:31,565
That's profiling.
And I will have none of it!

491
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,061
Oh, darn it!

492
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,228
I gum on my new shoes.

493
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,951
-He's trying light his shoe!
-It's a shoe-bomb!

494
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,064
-Get him!
-It's gum!

495
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:45,503
-Gun?
-He's got a gun!

496
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,801
It's not a gun!
No!

497
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,371
Federal Marshall.
You're under arrest!

498
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,460
Sir, I believe you just
shattered my coxyx!

499
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:03,821
(Captian over PA)
Folks, we may be experiencing a little turbulance.
The fasten seatbelt sign has been turned on.

500
00:25:03,822 --> 00:25:04,792
Hum Hum!

501
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,729
Well,

502
00:25:07,148 --> 00:25:08,431
You were no help whatsoever.

503
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:12,177
How could I help? I'm just a
woman with a dusty old uterus!

504
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,479
I never said they were ferrugentos!

505
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:16,829
We're getting close
to the drop site.

506
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,702
-I'll go first.
-You're going to bail out with your handcuffs?

507
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,836
No handcuffs can contain me!

508
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:24,499
Excuse me.
Violent Sky Marshall!

509
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:25,788
What do you want?

510
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,818
I have to "squeeze the lemon."

511
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:30,801
You heard me!

512
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:32,072
Squeeze...

513
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:33,446
...the lemon!

514
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:48,857
-Do you work out?
-I... Occasionally...

515
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,475
Yeah, I'm big on proteins.
Protein's great.

516
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,980
Get it out!

517
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,879
I got to get that out!
Gaa! Ahh!

518
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:11,134
It's in there!
That's in there!

519
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:21,360
No time for pain!

520
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,951
Over the drop zone...

521
00:26:29,143 --> 00:26:30,438
Ballsack!

522
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:41,391
Son of a hamster!

523
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:42,771
-You alright in there?
-Yeah!

524
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:43,776
Yes I am!

525
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:47,402
Everything's fine.
Mother of pearl!

526
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:55,455
Oh that burns!

527
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,169
Last chance...

528
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,013
Airlock activated.
3, 2, 1...

529
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:10,583
First package away.

530
00:27:17,924 --> 00:27:20,725
-Absolutely. I love cats.
-Really?
-Yeah.

531
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:27,690
Damn...

532
00:27:41,177 --> 00:27:42,733
Second package away.

533
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:02,460
Oh good!
You heard me!

534
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,820
Third package away.

535
00:28:08,076 --> 00:28:09,239
Third package?

536
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:16,934
99! Easter Island!

537
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:28,122
-I'll be right back!
-Where could you possibly be going?

538
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:50,814
Noooooooooo....

539
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:53,729
Ok ..

540
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,576
Never do that again!

541
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,304
Max, hang onto me!

542
00:28:57,448 --> 00:28:58,326
Stop it!

543
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:06,280
Max, I can't reach
my reserve!

544
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,641
Do something!

545
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:17,089
That would have definitely worked on me!

546
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:21,119
Are you crazy? If I can't
pull my shute, you'll die too!

547
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:42,409
-Aim for the haystack.
-Stop talking!

548
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,857
-Aim for the haystack, it's softer.
-Stop talking!

549
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:48,232
You missed it.

550
00:30:15,394 --> 00:30:17,963
Ok, not to keep dwelling on this,

551
00:30:18,113 --> 00:30:20,176
But that was some kiss!

552
00:30:20,426 --> 00:30:22,101
How did you know that would work?

553
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:24,417
Have you kissed other men
who then plumeted to their deaths?

554
00:30:24,553 --> 00:30:26,047
Ok, Ok!
You know what?

555
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:27,880
So far, our entire "partnership,"

556
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:30,445
Has consisted of me getting
you out of trouble.

557
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,024
Do you know why?
It is because you keep leading!

558
00:30:33,093 --> 00:30:35,134
So, here is how we stop that.
I lead now.

559
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,541
I am the one with field experience
and you do not know nothing!

560
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:38,825
I beg to differ.

561
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:41,979
I looked up your field agent exam.

562
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,672
-And I scored 8...
-You what?

563
00:30:42,763 --> 00:30:45,919
Your field agent exam.
I scored 8 points higher than you!

564
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,979
-This is not a classroom! This is real!
-That is the difference between a A+ and an A-!

565
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,415
-You are going to get us killed
if you don't start listening to me!
-Difference between an A+ and a A-!

566
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,048
A minus!

567
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:57,290
Ok, ok. You are faced with
an assassin. What do you do?

568
00:30:57,526 --> 00:31:00,096
-I take out my gun and I would shoo...
-You don't have a gun.

569
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:01,980
-I did until you took it.
-Bang. You're dead.

570
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:03,486
-No, I'm not.
-Bang. You're dead!

571
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:04,951
-Stop shooting me.
-You are dead!

572
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:07,190
-I don't like it when you shoot me!
-Bang, bang, bang...

573
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:09,734
Stop it. Stop shooting me more!
You already said that I was...

574
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:10,770
Hey!

575
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,775
Bury your manual.
I hear there are no grades.

576
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:17,435
There's only dead and not dead.

577
00:31:17,948 --> 00:31:21,587
You know... I am not completely
incompetent without a gun.

578
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:24,702
I am a master in the art
of Hwa Rang Do.

579
00:31:27,797 --> 00:31:29,212
I was not ready!

580
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,120
-That's my point.
-Yeah, you know what. That...

581
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:33,543
Hey! What was that?

582
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:39,920
Max is halfway to Moscow.

583
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:42,118
Don't tell me you're still
translating that Russian chatter.

584
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,114
They talk fast.
It's hard!

585
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:47,255
It takes like 8 of these morons
to do what Max did.

586
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,357
I can't wait til we
finish the HMIE new project!

587
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:51,486
All these stupid agents
will be obsolete!

588
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,255
-What's a HMIE?
-Hyber Mechanical Intelligence Entity.

589
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:56,532
Basically a robot.

590
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,254
Its a stolen KAOS technology.

591
00:31:58,352 --> 00:32:00,337
It's being reprogramed.
Top secret.

592
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:02,416
-Need to know.
-And you don't need! Hmm.

593
00:32:03,168 --> 00:32:06,174
I'm a trained killer, you know?
I can kill you with anything in this office.

594
00:32:06,418 --> 00:32:07,706
You want to die by post-its?

595
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,299
Cause I can make that happen!

596
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:10,813
And that's a slow death.

597
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,593
-Larabee.
-Yeah?

598
00:32:13,672 --> 00:32:15,526
-Were you the last one to use the copier?
-Yeah.

599
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:17,612
-You left it jammed.
-So?

600
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:20,543
Why don't you "unjam it"?

601
00:32:20,863 --> 00:32:23,780
-Just open the door, read the instructions...
-Is this your stapler?

602
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:25,836
-Yeah, you want me to show you how to use it?
-No.

603
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:30,096
-Now, why don't you unjam that?
-23...

604
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,976
-Yes?
-Can I have a moment please?
-Sure.

605
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:37,676
Let me tell you about a
patteren that's beginning to emerge.

606
00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:39,265
As a former field agent,

607
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:43,121
I am very much aware of how difficult it
is to make the transition office life.

608
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,981
You know, Chief, he didn't unjam the copier!

609
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:47,997
And we have rules here. You know that.
And if you don't follow the rules, then what are we?

610
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:49,270
I tell you what we're not,

611
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:52,372
We're not people who jams staples
into other people's heads.

612
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:54,120
That's CIA crap.

613
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,547
Alright, look Chief!
I'm your best guy!

614
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:59,477
I don't belong in an office making copies,
I should be out there with Max!

615
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:02,215
Look, 23, no more stapling today.

616
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:13,105
So, how do you know this place?

617
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,734
Well, as an analyst, I like to keep
my ears open.

618
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:18,525
It's amazing what you can learn
listening to chatter. In fact,

619
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,622
The Ladislas Krstic loves this place.
As do many KAOS agents.

620
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,149
Cafe Minspinsk in Smolinsk...

621
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:28,142
It doesn't get any better than thinsk!

622
00:33:29,364 --> 00:33:31,048
See what I just did?

623
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:33,904
I added an insk at the end of the
word. Made it sound Russian.

624
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:35,426
Should've smacked you harder.

625
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:36,918
Is that your default setting?

626
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,602
Do you just punch people in the face willey-nilley?

627
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:41,562
It's Tuesday.
I'll punch Max in the face.

628
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:44,391
A box with kittens.
Time to punch Max in the face.

629
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:46,681
Oh, I'm having some bread.
Time to punch Max in the face.

630
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:48,044
You know, I love bread.

631
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,714
And I know bread has a few carbs, but...

632
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:55,308
I've never really been afraid of carbs, because
it seems like no matter how many I eat...

633
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:56,584
I stay thinsk!

634
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:13,880
Oh, I'm sorry...
Are you talking to me?

635
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,647
No sprekee zee Russian.

636
00:34:57,694 --> 00:35:01,025
You know what? I will tell you,
I love your country!

637
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:04,132
No more Communism,
no rules of any kind. Really,

638
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:08,138
I'm filling my suitcases with steroids
and art from ancient Mespotania.

639
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,960
Ran over an old woman yesterday,
best vacation I've ever had!

640
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:17,391
Time to take my pill.

641
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:25,923
There was a guy in the bathroom,
who was really hot.

642
00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:27,900
Ok...

643
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,647
No, no no.
Radioactive hot.

644
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,461
Although, yes. He did have a, certain rugged
quality that some might find appealing.

645
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,505
How did you know he was radioactive?

646
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:39,447
My watch is a Geiger Counter.
You don't have one of these? Huh?

647
00:35:40,435 --> 00:35:43,957
Listen, I think he was part of the nuclear
theft in Chechnya. We should follow him.

648
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:46,176
I got to say Max,

649
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:48,608
You picked a good restaurant.

650
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:25,704
Of course!

651
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:27,892
Tripe soup!

652
00:36:28,115 --> 00:36:30,277
This must be Ladislas Krstic's house.

653
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:33,420
-What?
-Tripe soup is his favourite dish.

654
00:36:33,553 --> 00:36:37,102
-It was in the mission dossiê!
-Let's just see what we're up against, okay?

655
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,036
I didn't get to eat at the restaurant.

656
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:50,244
And if you skip a meal,
the next meal you over endulge.

657
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:52,996
-Oh, well. Let me. I've got nails.
-Its a receipe for...

658
00:36:54,188 --> 00:36:55,803
You owe me 3 dollars.

659
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,779
More guards.
We'll have to figure out a way in.

660
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:08,314
Miniature blow gun.
You don't have one of these? Hmm.

661
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:12,847
These darts are tipped with a potent tranquilizer
derived from the skin of a Amazonia lizard

662
00:37:12,848 --> 00:37:17,289
known as... "Los zapatos de la
muerte," the shoes of death.

663
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:18,863
Excuse me.

664
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:22,510
They're fourty yards out, that's
definitely the edge of my range.

665
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:25,794
I'm going to have to give this
one a little something extra.

666
00:37:41,478 --> 00:37:42,255
Wow!

667
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:45,466
-You look spectacular!
-Thanks.

668
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:48,097
You don't look too bad yourself.

669
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:51,543
-Is that a wig?
-Yeah, it came with the dress.

670
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,341
How did I get into these clothes?

671
00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:56,621
That's not important.
Let's go.

672
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,086
Am I wearing boxers?

673
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:06,741
For future reference,
I usually prefer briefs.

674
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,219
For their security.

675
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:11,754
A piece of mind. Going freebird
is not exactly ideal.

676
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,479
I don't like it!

677
00:38:28,414 --> 00:38:33,579
There must be 200 people here! Finding
Krstic will be like finding a needle in a haystack.

678
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,966
I'd love to dance!

679
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:46,334
You understand Russian.

680
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:47,912
Very impressive.

681
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:49,190
Shall we?

682
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:54,178
-I hope that your date doesn't mind.
-Oh, he's not my date.

683
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:57,408
He's just a local whore screwer
I hired to drive me around.

684
00:38:57,565 --> 00:38:59,800
It is a tragic story,
he's quite deaf.

685
00:38:59,915 --> 00:39:01,402
Really not bright.

686
00:39:02,261 --> 00:39:03,037
I...

687
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:04,167
... am going...

688
00:39:04,378 --> 00:39:05,204
...to dance...

689
00:39:05,278 --> 00:39:06,021
...now.

690
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:06,934
You...

691
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:07,840
...go...

692
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:09,611
...go get yourself some punch.

693
00:39:10,978 --> 00:39:12,047
Ok...

694
00:39:13,546 --> 00:39:15,736
I don't even know how much gets through.

695
00:39:24,192 --> 00:39:27,085
-Chief, I need your help.
-You're on, go ahead.

696
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:29,349
We have Krstic.
I have searched most of his house,

697
00:39:29,431 --> 00:39:32,534
But I cannot find his computer network.
Get me an infared satellite scan.

698
00:39:32,598 --> 00:39:35,156
I have to get back to 99.
She is in grave danger.

699
00:39:38,298 --> 00:39:40,235
Your house is so beautiful.

700
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:42,751
It must be difficult to go to work.

701
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:46,074
I don't have to go very far.

702
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:24,225
I wasn't talking to you.

703
00:40:28,277 --> 00:40:30,024
-Me?
-Da.

704
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,040
I don't know...

705
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,272
It'll be fun!

706
00:40:34,053 --> 00:40:35,121
Trust me.

707
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:28,122
-You are so light on your feet!
-I recently lost 150 pounds.

708
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:29,512
So did I!

709
00:41:30,233 --> 00:41:33,311
-Isn't it great! I so much more energy now.
-Me too!

710
00:42:37,813 --> 00:42:39,863
-Thanks for jumping.
-No problem.

711
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:05,236
Thank you for the lovely dance.

712
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,592
Did you see anything while I was dancing?

713
00:43:27,613 --> 00:43:30,879
Just once, but I don't think you
expected him to lift you so high.

714
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:35,044
Anyway, I found out that the
office is in the guest house.

715
00:43:35,123 --> 00:43:36,668
Oh really?
How did you do that?

716
00:43:36,721 --> 00:43:39,444
Show him the declatage? A little cleavage?
Bat your eyes?

717
00:43:39,445 --> 00:43:41,567
I'm not judging,
just detecting a patteren here.

718
00:43:41,693 --> 00:43:44,143
-Ready to work?
-I'm ready to work. You ready to work?

719
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:46,578
-Oh my God.
-Are you just having fun showing your...

720
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:56,479
6 guards, we are going
to need another way in.

721
00:43:56,524 --> 00:43:58,925
Stay on it Max.
Larabee, let's go! Move it!

722
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,692
Hey, what you do?
I can't find the right screen!

723
00:44:01,693 --> 00:44:03,677
It was just here a second ago.
Then I hit a button. Then it went away!

724
00:44:03,677 --> 00:44:04,657
What the hell did you hit?

725
00:44:04,658 --> 00:44:06,157
Don't yell at me!
Its really not helping!

726
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:09,652
If you don't find that screen Mr. Larabee,
I'm going to have you hunting for land mines...

727
00:44:09,737 --> 00:44:10,935
With a hammer!

728
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:15,580
Got it Max.
There is one other entrance.

729
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:19,724
-What kind of entrance?
-The kind where you're going to want to throw your shoes out afterwards!

730
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:22,567
Oh great, rats.

731
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:24,309
Not enough that there's poop.

732
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,374
You know what? I never saw James Bond
in rats or poop.

733
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:28,985
Let alone rats and poop.

734
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,692
Oh, look.
A rat riding on a piece of poop.

735
00:44:32,755 --> 00:44:35,162
Stop it.
It's just a storm drain.

736
00:44:39,353 --> 00:44:40,674
Here it is!

737
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,184
Exploding dental floss.
You don't have this? Hmm.

738
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:04,771
3...

739
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:06,598
2...

740
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:08,003
1...

741
00:45:30,265 --> 00:45:30,902
Right...

742
00:45:54,811 --> 00:45:56,382
Are you staring at my butt?

743
00:45:56,644 --> 00:45:58,635
No!
I am not.

744
00:45:58,793 --> 00:46:00,760
I might have been before, but I

745
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:03,877
Now I am again...
Alright, I'm stopping. I...

746
00:46:03,878 --> 00:46:06,850
Just pay attention to what I am doing
so that you can follow me exactly.

747
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:07,947
Yep.

748
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,916
Ok Max,
Little heads up.

749
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:33,190
These are high intensity lasers so whatever
part of you does touch gets sliced off.

750
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:36,348
One more reason why boxers
were a bad idea!

751
00:46:48,195 --> 00:46:50,605
Alright, so...
do I have to do it exactly like that?

752
00:46:51,107 --> 00:46:52,034
Just, come on!

753
00:47:04,935 --> 00:47:06,939
That's... Impressive!
Wow!

754
00:47:09,024 --> 00:47:10,909
Careful getting up,
this one's tricky!

755
00:47:11,546 --> 00:47:12,246
Good.

756
00:47:12,847 --> 00:47:14,002
Very good!

757
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:17,119
Ok,
its not that good.

758
00:47:35,784 --> 00:47:38,114
Max! Max!
Stay calm!

759
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:43,442
Max, keep it together.

760
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:51,018
That's not cheese!

761
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,323
Max, keep quiet!

762
00:48:01,334 --> 00:48:02,082
Ok...

763
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:03,181
Shall we?

764
00:48:40,204 --> 00:48:41,869
Did I heard something?

765
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:45,131
Yes, there were some...
tap dancers in the hallway.

766
00:48:47,087 --> 00:48:47,859
Damn it!

767
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:50,310
I can't get into their system,
Biometric security.

768
00:48:50,337 --> 00:48:51,893
If you don't mind 99...

769
00:48:56,821 --> 00:49:00,934
The old steam from your breath sticks to
everything but the oil from the last thumbprint trick.

770
00:49:01,131 --> 00:49:02,258
Here we go!

771
00:49:02,365 --> 00:49:04,141
Ah! Shipments of explosives.

772
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:05,760
Your boyfriend is a very bad man.

773
00:49:05,805 --> 00:49:07,593
Really good kisser.

774
00:49:07,664 --> 00:49:08,856
Ignoring that.

775
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,556
They were going to ship the detonators!
That's odd, wouldn't you say.

776
00:49:14,608 --> 00:49:16,468
-Well , he is a bomb maker.
-No, no, no!

777
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:17,959
What is odd is
that it was shipped

778
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,624
to a bakery in Moscow.

779
00:49:19,717 --> 00:49:22,209
These detonators can also
be used for nuclear bombs.

780
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:24,277
I think this is our connection to KAOS.

781
00:49:36,623 --> 00:49:37,852
I set that up.

782
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:48,947
Let her go!

783
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:50,805
No.

784
00:49:55,173 --> 00:49:58,881
I'm not totally incompetent
without a gun you know.

785
00:50:22,362 --> 00:50:23,751
Thanks for the help.

786
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:25,204
That's enough!

787
00:50:26,615 --> 00:50:31,651
Pity. I am about to shoot beautiful woman
and her retard, stable boy

788
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:32,999
and yet...

789
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:35,447
I will sleep like baby.

790
00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:43,889
-Not bad for a rookie.
-Not bad for an old lady.

791
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:57,021
-Siegfried here.
-How could you possibly screw this up?

792
00:50:57,336 --> 00:51:00,008
-The Krstic was an fool!
-And they got lucky!

793
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:02,994
-Who's that? Who's speaking?
-That's no one sir.

794
00:51:03,112 --> 00:51:05,797
They're heading towards you.
Don't disappoint me again!

795
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:08,090
Don't worry sir.
They won't get pass...

796
00:51:08,953 --> 00:51:11,959
-Why does he do that?
-Don't look at me, I'm "no one."

797
00:51:12,096 --> 00:51:13,433
And don't you forget it.

798
00:51:13,965 --> 00:51:15,815
Everyone here can be replaced.

799
00:51:16,027 --> 00:51:17,915
I even have backup for you.

800
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,789
It's called a rhinoceros.

801
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,160
I think it's time to
find new wheels.

802
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:47,062
Pull over.

803
00:51:51,383 --> 00:51:52,325
I, uh,

804
00:51:52,827 --> 00:51:54,892
Feel good about the mission so far.
Don't you?

805
00:51:55,514 --> 00:51:56,813
Uh, so far. Sure.

806
00:51:56,885 --> 00:51:58,517
I think we work very well together.

807
00:51:59,018 --> 00:52:00,212
Like at the mansion...

808
00:52:00,526 --> 00:52:04,220
The way I held that guy's hair
while you punched him in the throat.

809
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:05,412
That was, uh,

810
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:06,433
That was nice.

811
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:07,808
Nice?

812
00:52:08,162 --> 00:52:10,832
-Yeah, well, good teamwork!
-What are you doing?

813
00:52:11,373 --> 00:52:13,796
I am just saying that I think
we're very compatible...

814
00:52:13,901 --> 00:52:17,266
I think you are confusing
adrenaline with, I don't know...

815
00:52:17,372 --> 00:52:18,555
Some other kind of hormone.

816
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,169
-Oh, no, no, no. That is...
-You know what Max? Just stop it!

817
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:25,123
Ok, let me give you a lesson I
had to learn the hard way.

818
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:27,479
You can't trust anyone
out here, not even me.

819
00:52:27,662 --> 00:52:30,098
I mean, you know, I could
be a double agent!

820
00:52:30,885 --> 00:52:33,321
The break-in at CONTROL,
that was probably an inside job.

821
00:52:33,322 --> 00:52:36,403
and it happened just as I got back.
How do you know that it wasn't me?

822
00:52:37,189 --> 00:52:39,216
What are we talking about here?

823
00:52:39,715 --> 00:52:42,182
-Which one is going to attract the least attention?
-Uh,

824
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:46,405
Alright, well we have a couple of
Soviet era sedans here.

825
00:52:46,484 --> 00:52:47,663
We have that tractor.

826
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,414
That cart.

827
00:52:50,405 --> 00:52:51,124
And...

828
00:52:51,452 --> 00:52:52,710
That'll work.

829
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:54,086
No!

830
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:55,526
Yes!

831
00:52:56,379 --> 00:52:57,072
No!

832
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,065
Yes!

833
00:53:02,602 --> 00:53:04,648
Oh yeah, we are really under the radar now.

834
00:53:04,687 --> 00:53:05,794
Will you relax?

835
00:53:05,795 --> 00:53:08,890
Since the fall of Communism, everybody
has one of these here.

836
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,466
There's our little KAOS bakery.

837
00:53:36,537 --> 00:53:38,088
Now, I'm sure I don't have to remind you,

838
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,737
but this isn't anything
like the last place

839
00:53:39,738 --> 00:53:41,110
There's no party. There's no dancing.

840
00:53:41,111 --> 00:53:43,795
Everyone in there is a trained
killer. Do you understand?

841
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,673
Did they explain to you how your
belt buckle works?

842
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:50,806
No, but that technology for holding
up pants hasn't changed that much.

843
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:51,853
Max...

844
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:52,850
Hey, but ...

845
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:55,693
This one has a compartment.
Inside there's a pill.

846
00:53:55,835 --> 00:53:58,549
If captured, it would cause death in 9 seconds.

847
00:53:59,153 --> 00:53:59,956
Great!

848
00:54:00,461 --> 00:54:02,609
But how exactly do I get them to take it?

849
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,638
-You're not much of a laugher, are you?
-Here.

850
00:54:08,214 --> 00:54:09,745
-Put this on.
-On what?

851
00:54:09,804 --> 00:54:11,746
On your molar.
It's a tooth radio.

852
00:54:11,825 --> 00:54:14,525
It sends and receives sound up
your jaw bone and into your inner ear.

853
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:16,154
but I can't hear anything
outside your mouth.

854
00:54:16,155 --> 00:54:17,903
So, if you get in trouble, you have to say so.

855
00:54:18,084 --> 00:54:19,633
Is it working?

856
00:54:22,556 --> 00:54:24,244
-Is it working?
-Yes.

857
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:25,241
Good!

858
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:26,315
Ok...

859
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:28,302
Well, you know what to do...

860
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:29,931
Good luck in there.

861
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:31,073
You too.

862
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:02,816
No thank you.
I am here for something else.

863
00:55:03,223 --> 00:55:03,954
Bread?

864
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,063
Something... hot!

865
00:55:06,247 --> 00:55:09,248
-- We have rolls that just came out.
-Even hotter.

866
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:09,875
Much...

867
00:55:10,383 --> 00:55:11,144
Much hotter.

868
00:55:11,457 --> 00:55:13,305
I already have boyfriend.

869
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:16,856
-Alright.
-Although, I could make exception.

870
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:17,524
No, that's...

871
00:55:17,668 --> 00:55:18,401
-Sure.
-Ok.

872
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,047
Flour sex in back.
Very comfortable!

873
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:24,215
I don't think we are on the same page.

874
00:55:25,004 --> 00:55:26,416
I am here because...

875
00:55:26,706 --> 00:55:28,158
Ladislas Krstic sent me.

876
00:55:30,045 --> 00:55:31,303
Take number.

877
00:55:32,836 --> 00:55:34,473
But I'm the only one here!

878
00:56:08,895 --> 00:56:12,027
-Who are you?
-My name is Knugar Schfulkas.

879
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,516
-Who are you?
-I am Siegfried.

880
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:17,830
-Did you say Siegfried?

881
00:56:18,329 --> 00:56:19,087
Yes!

882
00:56:19,428 --> 00:56:21,525
I understand that you're
the man to see

883
00:56:21,526 --> 00:56:24,226
when someone is interested in
aquiring items of a nuclear nature.

884
00:56:24,317 --> 00:56:28,115
-How do I know you're not CONTROL?
-- If I were CONTROL, you'd already be dead.

885
00:56:28,194 --> 00:56:30,169
If you were CONTROL, you'd already be dead!

886
00:56:30,223 --> 00:56:31,415
Well, neither of us is dead,

887
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:34,082
So I'm obviously not from CONTROL.

888
00:56:37,578 --> 00:56:39,137
That actually makes sense!

889
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,120
Follow me Mr...

890
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:43,637
Schfulkas.

891
00:56:54,752 --> 00:56:57,713
The Ode to Joy, from
Beethoven's 9th.

892
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,801
Stone deaf when he wrote it.

893
00:56:59,802 --> 00:57:01,503
He had syphílis. Fun stuff.

894
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:03,270
Yes, a personal favorite.

895
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:06,393
A bit familiar, but it ends with a bang.

896
00:57:07,459 --> 00:57:09,229
You're doing great Max!

897
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,301
What I'm about to show you is the
inner sanctom of our entire operations.

898
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:17,402
The inner sanctom of the entire operation?

899
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:20,221
Yes.

900
00:57:29,077 --> 00:57:29,877
This is it?

901
00:57:30,271 --> 00:57:31,883
Of course not.
I lied.

902
00:57:32,197 --> 00:57:33,347
He does that.

903
00:57:33,636 --> 00:57:36,059
I'm going to kill you and then
I'm going to kill your partner.

904
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:38,287
I don't know who you're talking about.

905
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:46,227
Ah, Mrs. Schfulkas must be lost.

906
00:57:46,803 --> 00:57:48,691
I think it's only fair to warn you,

907
00:57:48,692 --> 00:57:50,507
this facility is surrounded by

908
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:53,273
a highly trained team
of 130 Black Ops Snipers.

909
00:57:53,361 --> 00:57:57,121
-I don't believe you.
-Would you believe 2 dozen Delta Force commandos?

910
00:57:57,175 --> 00:57:59,556
-No.
-How about Chuck Norris with a B.B. gun?

911
00:58:00,329 --> 00:58:01,623
Goodbye Mr Smart.

912
00:58:04,116 --> 00:58:08,464
Well Mr Shtarker,
I think you have underestimated me...

913
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:10,902
and the element of... Surprise!

914
00:58:19,466 --> 00:58:21,614
99, you've been compromised.
Get out!

915
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,630
Access denied.

916
00:59:11,067 --> 00:59:14,038
Access denied.
Access denied.

917
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:15,570
Access denied.

918
00:59:28,718 --> 00:59:29,701
Max, where are you?

919
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:33,616
-99, I found the Yellow Cake!
-Of course you did, its a bakery.

920
00:59:33,658 --> 00:59:36,607
No, not yellow cake, cake. Yellow Cake uranium!

921
00:59:36,752 --> 00:59:40,496
Although, there is yellow cake, cake here as well.

922
00:59:41,806 --> 00:59:42,776
Oh Max.

923
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,409
Max...

924
01:00:11,226 --> 01:00:12,489
-Do you read me?
-99!

925
01:00:12,769 --> 01:00:15,597
-I lost your signal. What happened your radio?
-I swallowed it.

926
01:00:15,689 --> 01:00:18,818
-I can get it back to you but you may not want it.
-Good Lord.

927
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:22,072
Listen, I have placed charges
at key stress points all over the building.

928
01:00:22,073 --> 01:00:22,871
What?

929
01:00:23,156 --> 01:00:25,715
Max, you can't blow up a building
full of radioactive material!

930
01:00:25,716 --> 01:00:26,902
I know that 99.

931
01:00:26,903 --> 01:00:30,210
I placed only enough charges to safely
bury the weapons lab.

932
01:00:30,703 --> 01:00:33,157
-- Max, that's brilliant!
-Wow,

933
01:00:33,647 --> 01:00:36,382
That's maybe the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

934
01:01:02,497 --> 01:01:04,415
I don't get it,
I thought he was dead!

935
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:06,516
I will say this,
he's not a quitter.

936
01:01:22,727 --> 01:01:24,824
This is just ridiculous!

937
01:01:31,177 --> 01:01:33,046
99!
Wake up 99!

938
01:01:33,188 --> 01:01:35,077
Maybe you should kiss him again!

939
01:01:37,779 --> 01:01:39,391
Wait! I know that voice!

940
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,200
The Decepador!
The Saltador!

941
01:01:48,644 --> 01:01:49,679
Ahh!
That was me!

942
01:01:53,939 --> 01:01:56,395
-Max?
-I'm, yep. Still fighting!

943
01:02:13,955 --> 01:02:16,773
Dalip, I can prove that I know you!

944
01:02:16,877 --> 01:02:18,631
Your favourite dish is chicken tica!

945
01:02:19,301 --> 01:02:22,094
Like me, you enjoy American Top 40
with Ryan Seacrest!

946
01:02:46,372 --> 01:02:47,198
Wait...

947
01:02:47,482 --> 01:02:49,484
Wait, no wait.
There's something else that I know.

948
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:50,102
Max.

949
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:52,023
Your marriage is in trouble.

950
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:54,795
Your darling wife, Synot, is leaving you.

951
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,595
But there is still hope...

952
01:02:57,004 --> 01:02:58,127
Do you love her?

953
01:03:04,539 --> 01:03:05,820
Then show her.

954
01:03:06,368 --> 01:03:07,739
Go home for lunch.

955
01:03:08,027 --> 01:03:10,375
Take her with you the
next time you go to kill someone!

956
01:03:10,684 --> 01:03:12,954
She just wants to be
with you, and frankly,

957
01:03:13,024 --> 01:03:14,411
that means less time with her sister.

958
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:16,855
Who we both know, is
undermining your relationship!

959
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:20,578
Kick the gun to me.

960
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:21,759
99, please!

961
01:03:22,748 --> 01:03:24,571
Big people feel pain too.

962
01:03:35,871 --> 01:03:37,113
What are you doing?

963
01:03:37,989 --> 01:03:39,978
Oh no...
Oh no...

964
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:41,194
Max!

965
01:03:46,551 --> 01:03:47,868
That's alright.

966
01:03:50,564 --> 01:03:53,164
Her sister's such a bitch.

967
01:04:00,814 --> 01:04:02,286
-Are you alright?
-Yeah.

968
01:04:02,313 --> 01:04:03,706
That was amazing!

969
01:04:04,585 --> 01:04:05,644
Thank you!

970
01:04:07,607 --> 01:04:08,872
We gotta go!

971
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:18,613
99!

972
01:04:25,018 --> 01:04:27,473
-What was that?
-I prempta...

973
01:04:30,389 --> 01:04:32,589
-Come here!
-Good idea.

974
01:04:32,979 --> 01:04:35,998
We will climb up with you and all go...

975
01:04:36,281 --> 01:04:37,281
together....

976
01:04:46,809 --> 01:04:49,396
He left us here!
What a douche.

977
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,331
Missed it by that much.

978
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,360
Well, that's convenient!
Shoot them!

979
01:05:24,235 --> 01:05:26,278
Whatever you do 99, don't look down.

980
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,575
-I'm going to try to get us over to that ledge!
-Max.

981
01:05:28,576 --> 01:05:30,490
We can do this 99!

982
01:05:31,342 --> 01:05:32,221
Max!

983
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:33,950
Right...

984
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:39,636
Oh, thanks Chief.

985
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,036
Okay.
No problem.

986
01:05:42,132 --> 01:05:45,002
The Chief is thrilled.
He sent 23 out to observe the clean up.

987
01:05:45,087 --> 01:05:45,942
Great.

988
01:05:47,017 --> 01:05:47,947
Listen,

989
01:05:48,217 --> 01:05:51,421
It is possible that you could
answer a personal question?

990
01:05:51,796 --> 01:05:52,802
It's possible.

991
01:05:53,966 --> 01:05:55,645
Why did you change your looks?

992
01:05:57,058 --> 01:06:00,450
Oh, um. That's not really
a personal question.

993
01:06:00,863 --> 01:06:04,016
Things from my non work sphere
spilled into my work sphere,

994
01:06:04,198 --> 01:06:05,514
Facts became know.

995
01:06:05,515 --> 01:06:07,781
Identities were compromised.
And I became a brunette!

996
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:11,714
Wow, that is
a great story...

997
01:06:11,792 --> 01:06:14,479
...in which you reveal absolutely
nothing about yourself.

998
01:06:19,816 --> 01:06:21,516
I blew a mission...

999
01:06:22,914 --> 01:06:26,375
I was involved with someone from work,
I lost focus...

1000
01:06:26,613 --> 01:06:27,696
The mission blew up...

1001
01:06:27,981 --> 01:06:31,684
I broke it off with that person, but my
identity had already been revealed.

1002
01:06:32,265 --> 01:06:36,044
So, I had two choices. I could either
spend the rest of my life behind a desk,

1003
01:06:36,054 --> 01:06:39,578
which would be like 8 hours a day of...

1004
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:41,734
...scraping a cheese grater against
my forehead.

1005
01:06:41,762 --> 01:06:43,813
-Oh, you know...
-Yes...

1006
01:06:44,046 --> 01:06:47,224
Or could I change my face.
So that's what I did.

1007
01:06:49,482 --> 01:06:53,502
It was painful, but, uh, needed to be done.

1008
01:06:57,922 --> 01:07:00,350
-I don't want to talk more this anymore.
-Ok.

1009
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:06,291
I used to look like my mom.

1010
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,256
I used to look like
two of my moms put together...

1011
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,673
Sir?

1012
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,660
If I may ask...

1013
01:07:54,927 --> 01:07:57,753
How did you choose the target?
Why Los Angeles?

1014
01:07:57,932 --> 01:08:00,897
Major city,
lot's of media attention,

1015
01:08:01,729 --> 01:08:03,222
And the president will be there.

1016
01:08:03,766 --> 01:08:06,808
Still, its too bad
about all the dead movie stars.

1017
01:08:06,937 --> 01:08:07,840
Yes,

1018
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:12,548
What will we do without their
razor-sharp political advice?

1019
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,675
Oh my God!
Have you eaten the crew?

1020
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,631
Oh look, it understands.

1021
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,305
Get back to work!

1022
01:08:39,602 --> 01:08:40,902
No, that's not possible.

1023
01:08:41,603 --> 01:08:44,042
No, no, no!
Max said that...

1024
01:08:46,085 --> 01:08:46,685
No,

1025
01:08:50,686 --> 01:08:52,086
That doesn't make any sense.

1026
01:08:54,687 --> 01:08:57,681
Yellow cake uranium?
Warheads? An entire production line?

1027
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,312
There's nothing here, but
what used to be a bakery.

1028
01:08:59,365 --> 01:09:01,200
Are you telling me that there are no weapons?

1029
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:03,346
That there's no radioactivity of any kind?

1030
01:09:03,421 --> 01:09:06,078
Nothing. I swept the entire area,
and it's clean.

1031
01:09:06,134 --> 01:09:08,832
-But Max said that he...
-Did you see the evidence yourself?

1032
01:09:09,635 --> 01:09:10,384
No.

1033
01:09:11,285 --> 01:09:14,044
No, he everytime he felt something,
he was alone...

1034
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,485
-Ok, what do you want me to do with Max?
-Do with Max?

1035
01:09:22,614 --> 01:09:23,928
Max...

1036
01:09:25,242 --> 01:09:27,896
You were right when
you said I shouldn't trust you.

1037
01:09:29,754 --> 01:09:31,275
Give me the phone!

1038
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:37,696
Who might this be?
Siegfried?

1039
01:09:37,765 --> 01:09:39,605
-Hello Max.
-Chief?

1040
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:44,574
Knockout gas 99?
Please...

1041
01:09:44,755 --> 01:09:46,947
I have trained my body to be
impervious to..

1042
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:48,959
That's new stuff...

1043
01:09:51,443 --> 01:09:52,643
Oh Max!

1044
01:10:00,644 --> 01:10:04,590
I am very disappointed Max! I thought you
and I were supposedly cut from the same cloth.

1045
01:10:04,641 --> 01:10:07,451
Chief, we are.
How can you think that I am a double agent?

1046
01:10:07,477 --> 01:10:09,655
You lied about finding
evidence of radioactivity.

1047
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:12,021
You conviently killed Krstic
before anybody could question him.

1048
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,544
And there's a little matter of your stoning
my head in with a fire extinguisher!

1049
01:10:15,649 --> 01:10:19,284
I said I was sorry. You just didn't hear me
because you were in a mini-coma.

1050
01:10:19,521 --> 01:10:21,456
You've made CONTROL a laughing-stock...

1051
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:23,939
The Vice-President wants to
shut us down, you know?

1052
01:10:27,104 --> 01:10:29,816
99, this whole week,

1053
01:10:30,865 --> 01:10:32,107
Last night,

1054
01:10:32,658 --> 01:10:35,550
-You know me.
-Apparently not.

1055
01:10:36,281 --> 01:10:38,421
Oh my God!
You too?

1056
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:41,389
You and Max? You said we had to
break up because we work together.

1057
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:44,250
My God!
You and 23?

1058
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:46,453
I am so sexually
threatened right now.

1059
01:10:51,785 --> 01:10:54,526
You have reached the United States
Department Of Homeland Security.

1060
01:10:54,949 --> 01:10:57,602
For threats against the Continental United States,
press 1.

1061
01:10:58,006 --> 01:11:00,031
For threats against Hawaii, press 2.

1062
01:11:00,157 --> 01:11:02,513
For threats against Puerto Rico, press 3.
-You know,

1063
01:11:02,573 --> 01:11:06,288
You're the only human being I know
who snores when he's awake.

1064
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,929
Ok,
Today's threat assessment.

1065
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,913
There are 72 threats on the list.

1066
01:11:12,577 --> 01:11:14,541
-Mike?
-Thank you Mr. Vice President.

1067
01:11:14,829 --> 01:11:17,523
Ok, we have a deteriorating
situation in Venezuela,

1068
01:11:17,598 --> 01:11:20,382
We have a deteriorating
situation in Afghanistan,

1069
01:11:20,454 --> 01:11:22,814
What about the deteriorating situation
in North Korea?

1070
01:11:22,882 --> 01:11:25,233
-I was getting to that...
-When? Next week?

1071
01:11:25,272 --> 01:11:27,547
Yes, next Tuesday.
Right after I kick your ass!

1072
01:11:27,548 --> 01:11:28,579
Gentlemen!

1073
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,998
When we argue, the terrorists win.

1074
01:11:34,627 --> 01:11:37,947
Any way. Last night at a private dinner,
President Kim Jong Ill

1075
01:11:37,948 --> 01:11:40,573
Made a very odd threat to,
and I quote

1076
01:11:41,477 --> 01:11:43,910
"Make a pudding from the bones of Americans!"

1077
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:45,728
Oh, that guy's insane.

1078
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:47,703
Doesn't he know bones are crunchy?

1079
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:49,464
Who'd want a crunchy pudding!

1080
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,490
-War room.
-Finally!

1081
01:11:53,713 --> 01:11:56,752
My name is Siegfried
and I represent KAOS.

1082
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,099
Over the past few months, we have
assembled a stockpile of nuclear weapons,

1083
01:12:01,374 --> 01:12:04,442
Which we have distributed to 20 unfriendly,

1084
01:12:04,443 --> 01:12:06,147
Unstable dictators.

1085
01:12:06,525 --> 01:12:09,692
For the moment, KAOS retains
the bomb activation codes.

1086
01:12:09,982 --> 01:12:11,873
But, we will release the codes,

1087
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:13,571
Unless our demands are met.

1088
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,865
-What are your demands?
-200 billion dollars by 3 pm.

1089
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:19,548
200 billion dollars by 3 pm?

1090
01:12:19,724 --> 01:12:22,787
You seem a bit slow.
Is there someone else I can talk to?

1091
01:12:23,002 --> 01:12:24,033
Good one!

1092
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:27,581
Look, Siegfried.
We don't negotiate with terrorists,

1093
01:12:27,582 --> 01:12:28,969
And you're obviously bluffing.

1094
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,486
-Take a hike!
-What are you doing? Are you kidding me?

1095
01:12:31,537 --> 01:12:33,725
You spend half the morning
talking about crunchy pudding,

1096
01:12:33,726 --> 01:12:36,333
-And you ignore a credible threat?
-Credible? Come on.

1097
01:12:36,398 --> 01:12:37,892
KAOS has been debunk for 20 years.

1098
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:40,864
With all due respect, the CIA
knows nothing about KAOS.

1099
01:12:41,052 --> 01:12:44,550
-CONTROL has to be in charge here!
-Like when you bombed that bakery?

1100
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,152
Muffins of mass destruction!

1101
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:49,639
That's it,
I've been waiting for this since Nixon!

1102
01:12:49,678 --> 01:12:50,883
-Here we go...
-Bring it!

1103
01:12:50,922 --> 01:12:53,228
I've got a new pacemaker.
I can go all day!

1104
01:12:53,229 --> 01:12:54,500
Ok. OK!
Then come on!

1105
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,465
It seems like they don't believe you...

1106
01:13:01,514 --> 01:13:04,907
Which is why we've
arranged for a little demonstration.

1107
01:13:51,633 --> 01:13:52,368
Chief!

1108
01:13:52,604 --> 01:13:54,120
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes!

1109
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,859
You and 23 are coming with me
to see the President.

1110
01:13:57,003 --> 01:13:59,477
-Can't you just call him?
-The Vice-President won't let me through.

1111
01:14:00,105 --> 01:14:02,421
I can't believe we have to go all the way to Los Angeles.

1112
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,539
Why is the President
never here?

1113
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:07,348
Sir, I'm sure whatever he's
doing is vital to the nation.

1114
01:14:07,546 --> 01:14:08,891
"Good Night, Moon!"

1115
01:14:10,318 --> 01:14:12,428
"Good Night cow jumping over the moon."

1116
01:14:13,344 --> 01:14:16,618
Uh, actually. I think you would
suck as my teacher.

1117
01:14:17,272 --> 01:14:18,871
Well, for one...

1118
01:14:20,506 --> 01:14:21,265
Hey Smart!

1119
01:14:21,526 --> 01:14:22,705
Happy Birthday!

1120
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:31,293
I'm fat!

1121
01:14:41,258 --> 01:14:42,306
Gentlemen.

1122
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:46,975
Good, the itchy kind.

1123
01:14:47,013 --> 01:14:48,271
My favorite!

1124
01:14:48,762 --> 01:14:50,545
Does this one also have small pox?

1125
01:14:52,853 --> 01:14:55,549
And that was a human tooth.

1126
01:14:58,837 --> 01:15:02,157
Here's a sweet dedication
from a little lady named Dalip,

1127
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:03,683
It's to her boyfriend Max.

1128
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:06,723
"Meet me in LA,
things will be very hot...

1129
01:15:06,971 --> 01:15:07,873
Nuclear hot."

1130
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:11,383
I don't know. If I were Max,
I would get myself to LA!

1131
01:15:21,148 --> 01:15:23,258
Hey, dumb guards!

1132
01:15:23,468 --> 01:15:27,698
Why don't you come in here, so I can
make you my pretty, little girlfriends?

1133
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:29,865
You'll have to shower for weeks!

1134
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:34,738
But you will never get the smell off it.
You two seem very angry!

1135
01:15:36,702 --> 01:15:38,618
Thank you sir!
May I have another?

1136
01:15:41,118 --> 01:15:42,594
I was kidding...

1137
01:15:50,511 --> 01:15:51,061
9 ...

1138
01:15:51,205 --> 01:15:51,820
... 4 ...

1139
01:15:51,912 --> 01:15:52,304
... 3 ...

1140
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:52,854
... 6 ...

1141
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:53,783
... 8 ...

1142
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:56,575
9 ...

1143
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:57,663
... 4 ...

1144
01:15:57,797 --> 01:15:58,974
... 3 ...

1145
01:15:59,211 --> 01:16:00,129
... 6 ...

1146
01:16:00,351 --> 01:16:01,042
... 8.

1147
01:16:16,675 --> 01:16:18,168
Turn around slowly!

1148
01:16:20,526 --> 01:16:23,602
Guys, you have to believe me!
I am not a double agent!

1149
01:16:23,693 --> 01:16:26,444
-We never thought you were!
-Yeah, we love you man!

1150
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:29,145
Then, what's with the firearm
and the freakshow expressions?

1151
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,571
For the security cameras.

1152
01:16:30,654 --> 01:16:33,224
If it looks like we let you go,
we'd totally get fired!

1153
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:35,035
Got it.

1154
01:16:37,891 --> 01:16:40,849
-So, where are the Chief and 99?
-They flew to LA to talk with the President.

1155
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:43,494
I need to get out of here before
someone else comes to stop me!

1156
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:45,574
-I suggest you overpower us.
-Good idea!

1157
01:16:45,628 --> 01:16:47,462
-Bruce, I will smash you in the face.
-Thank you!

1158
01:16:47,548 --> 01:16:49,207
Loyd, I will simulate your disembowelment.

1159
01:16:49,532 --> 01:16:50,336
Ready?

1160
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:51,200
-1...
-Oh!

1161
01:16:51,201 --> 01:16:52,607
Not yet!
I haven't punched you yet!

1162
01:16:52,715 --> 01:16:54,429
-React when I punch you!
-Oh!

1163
01:16:54,691 --> 01:16:55,227
1 ...

1164
01:16:55,398 --> 01:16:55,933
2 ...

1165
01:16:56,641 --> 01:16:57,298
3 ...

1166
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,170
Wrong way...

1167
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:01,449
Ok, wait!  You should know,
sometimes I faint...

1168
01:17:01,501 --> 01:17:03,862
-I'm not actually going to hit you.
-No, but when I see blood...

1169
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:06,389
-Or talk about blood!
-There will be no blood!

1170
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:08,272
Hang in there!
Hang in... Buddy...

1171
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:57,410
What you are doing? Don't
come running out in the middle of the road,

1172
01:17:57,411 --> 01:17:59,450
You could get hit by a ca...

1173
01:17:59,823 --> 01:18:00,477
Well,

1174
01:18:00,595 --> 01:18:02,286
That was ironic.

1175
01:18:16,132 --> 01:18:17,232
Chief, I'm not buying it.

1176
01:18:17,584 --> 01:18:20,963
With all our satellites, there's no way
anybody could possibly have

1177
01:18:21,138 --> 01:18:23,076
nuclear bombs, that
we would know about.

1178
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,129
Nuclear!

1179
01:18:25,032 --> 01:18:26,349
-What was that?
-Sorry...

1180
01:18:26,513 --> 01:18:28,749
Mr President,
if I could just please show you some data...

1181
01:18:28,808 --> 01:18:31,175
Just, uh...
Just back up here a sec.

1182
01:18:31,526 --> 01:18:33,692
The 1st thing I'd like to know is:

1183
01:18:33,753 --> 01:18:35,599
What did the Vice-President
have to say about this?

1184
01:18:35,665 --> 01:18:39,344
I'm afraid the Vice-President and I had a
less-than-cordial encounter yesterday sir.

1185
01:18:39,436 --> 01:18:41,121
-Less than cordial, you say?
-Yes, sir.

1186
01:18:41,127 --> 01:18:42,327
Well, I'll say...

1187
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:46,667
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he uh,
sent me this little movie.

1188
01:18:46,804 --> 01:18:48,327
Put it right here on my cell phone.

1189
01:18:48,446 --> 01:18:51,233
Let me share this with you here.
This is my favorite part here:

1190
01:18:51,271 --> 01:18:52,906
"I have a new pacemaker.
We can go all day! "

1191
01:18:54,168 --> 01:18:55,525
Oh, Chief.

1192
01:18:55,954 --> 01:18:56,846
Very sweet tackle!

1193
01:18:56,951 --> 01:18:57,516
Look!

1194
01:18:57,583 --> 01:18:59,231
Look at the surprise on his face!

1195
01:18:59,571 --> 01:19:02,033
-I probably owe him an apology for that sir.
-No, no, no, no!

1196
01:19:02,152 --> 01:19:03,816
Please,
Just save your breath.

1197
01:19:03,924 --> 01:19:06,098
But, I have to agree
with that son of a bitch.

1198
01:19:06,207 --> 01:19:08,072
We cannot respond
to every threat!

1199
01:19:09,685 --> 01:19:10,873
Case Closed!

1200
01:19:34,179 --> 01:19:35,849
-Max?
-Hello 99!

1201
01:19:36,255 --> 01:19:38,761
-Trace 99's call now!
-Where are you?

1202
01:19:38,951 --> 01:19:39,906
That's not important.

1203
01:19:40,005 --> 01:19:43,531
What is important is that KAOS has
planted a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles!

1204
01:19:43,835 --> 01:19:45,628
We got him!
He's still in Washington.

1205
01:19:45,773 --> 01:19:49,046
Listen, while I was in my
cell, I had some time to think.

1206
01:19:51,169 --> 01:19:54,638
I realized that, even tough I was
accused of something I didn't do,

1207
01:19:55,103 --> 01:19:55,770
I was happy.

1208
01:19:56,357 --> 01:19:58,699
Because, at least for a 
little while,

1209
01:19:58,764 --> 01:20:00,748
I got to live my dream of being an agent.

1210
01:20:02,074 --> 01:20:03,468
And I got to be with you...

1211
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:06,484
I learned that you have a
have a mean right cross,

1212
01:20:06,706 --> 01:20:09,453
You are almost as
good a dancer as me,

1213
01:20:10,016 --> 01:20:13,227
-And you used to look like your mom.
-Max...

1214
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:14,160
Please 99.

1215
01:20:14,205 --> 01:20:16,361
All I'm asking is for
you look me in the eyes

1216
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:18,805
and tell me that you don't
feel something, too.

1217
01:20:19,705 --> 01:20:20,547
Freeze!

1218
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,101
Oh Max...

1219
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:24,414
How can I look in your eyes?

1220
01:20:25,953 --> 01:20:27,156
Just turn around.

1221
01:20:34,393 --> 01:20:36,431
Why are you talking into your shoe?

1222
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:39,494
The old call forwarding from the
shoe phone to the cell phone,

1223
01:20:39,495 --> 01:20:41,147
so you don't know where I am,

1224
01:20:41,148 --> 01:20:44,942
And then I appear on the roof
behind you and surprise everyone trick.

1225
01:20:45,026 --> 01:20:46,283
Don't move!

1226
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:48,353
-Max, what are you doing?
-How did you get here?

1227
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:53,087
Do you , do you have another one of these?

1228
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,027
It doesn't matter.

1229
01:20:58,099 --> 01:21:00,786
What matters is that there is a bomb, and I
I am here to help you find it!

1230
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:01,974
How do you know this?

1231
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,444
-I'd rather not say.
-Max, there are millions of lives at stake!

1232
01:21:05,565 --> 01:21:08,282
If you have credible information
from a reliable source,

1233
01:21:08,398 --> 01:21:10,356
I want to know it,
and I want to know it now!

1234
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:15,244
-I heard it from America's Sweet Heart, Ryan Seacrest.
-Whoo...

1235
01:21:15,428 --> 01:21:17,982
-Come on...
-It was a coded message!

1236
01:21:18,074 --> 01:21:20,996
Max we're running out of time here!
What are you talking about?

1237
01:21:21,226 --> 01:21:24,449
I received a tip from a KAOS agent
who I befriended at the bakery.

1238
01:21:30,354 --> 01:21:32,790
-I think we should trust him, Chief.
-Oh, absolutely Chief...

1239
01:21:32,829 --> 01:21:34,095
I'm with 99 on that one.

1240
01:21:34,134 --> 01:21:36,559
Everytime I look at Max's
puppy eyes, I'm a goner.

1241
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,529
Oh my God!

1242
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:40,284
You've really never had anyone
break up with you, have you?

1243
01:21:42,136 --> 01:21:42,960
Chief,

1244
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:44,962
You said that you and I are alike.

1245
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:47,597
That we are both old fashioned men...

1246
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:49,625
Well, I have an old fashioned hunch.

1247
01:21:50,032 --> 01:21:51,186
I have a hunch,

1248
01:21:51,498 --> 01:21:52,745
That you have a hunch.

1249
01:21:53,006 --> 01:21:54,566
And I am telling the truth.

1250
01:21:55,674 --> 01:21:56,513
Max,

1251
01:21:57,929 --> 01:22:01,283
Any double-agent who escapes
from a high security holding situation,

1252
01:22:01,466 --> 01:22:04,654
Only to fall right back into the arms of
 the people that got him in the first place,

1253
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,066
Is either an idiot, or
not a double-agent!

1254
01:22:07,067 --> 01:22:08,971
And I don't think you're an idiot.

1255
01:22:09,405 --> 01:22:10,631
Thank you, Chief.

1256
01:22:11,012 --> 01:22:14,309
Now we know that
the President is in town,

1257
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:17,108
But what exactly is
he doing here today?

1258
01:22:17,187 --> 01:22:18,639
-Max!
-Yes,

1259
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:21,503
-We need to find out his exact itenerary.
-But Max...

1260
01:22:21,586 --> 01:22:24,454
I know, I know 99.
I need to go get a paper.

1261
01:22:33,948 --> 01:22:36,111
-We're in position. More or less.
-Roger.

1262
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:39,568
-I have the whole security system online, just remember,
-Yes, we know!

1263
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,937
How about a little "radio-silence"?

1264
01:22:42,633 --> 01:22:45,931
I wanna quit, but what can I do?
He's married to my sister.

1265
01:22:46,531 --> 01:22:47,513
Oh, by the way,

1266
01:22:47,598 --> 01:22:50,848
I reviewed the security tapes from
the explosion at the bakery...

1267
01:22:50,884 --> 01:22:54,461
And I know that you let those
CONTROL agents get away.

1268
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:57,153
So, unless you do your job today,

1269
01:22:57,279 --> 01:22:59,553
Your lovely wife Zhinat,

1270
01:22:59,789 --> 01:23:02,446
Will have eaten her last Kabab.

1271
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:26,973
Red team, check for access violation
in Quadrant 3, Sector 7.

1272
01:23:27,373 --> 01:23:28,273
Copy that.

1273
01:23:29,874 --> 01:23:30,527
Go!

1274
01:23:47,843 --> 01:23:49,615
That's it,
you're in!

1275
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,454
Door secure.

1276
01:24:52,728 --> 01:24:55,139
We need to get everyone out,
and shut this place down!

1277
01:24:55,204 --> 01:24:56,649
We've swept the building,
it's fine.

1278
01:24:56,688 --> 01:24:58,510
The Secret Service doesn't make mistakes,

1279
01:24:58,511 --> 01:25:00,159
Like the fabulous bakery boys!

1280
01:25:00,199 --> 01:25:01,278
Who told you about that?

1281
01:25:01,311 --> 01:25:03,685
-Who told you about that?
-Hey, take it easy old timer.

1282
01:25:03,686 --> 01:25:04,786
You're going to give yourself a heart attack!

1283
01:25:04,831 --> 01:25:08,527
-And this day will not include me blowing air into your mouth.
-Hey, do you want a piece of me?

1284
01:25:08,528 --> 01:25:10,925
-Chief, he's not worth it!
-You want a piece of me?

1285
01:25:12,301 --> 01:25:14,450
-You'd better watch it...
-Let me at 'im!

1286
01:25:24,043 --> 01:25:26,934
From Los Angeles, California,
we welcome you to a special

1287
01:25:26,935 --> 01:25:29,910
live broadcast of our
concert for the President!

1288
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,992
Dignitaries from around the world
have gathered for the event.

1289
01:25:33,049 --> 01:25:35,804
We will be broadcasting from
the Walt Disney Concert Hall,

1290
01:25:35,853 --> 01:25:36,997
Throughout the evening.

1291
01:25:37,336 --> 01:25:39,550
There has got to be another way in!

1292
01:25:39,602 --> 01:25:42,292
Why are we even still here?
There are 50 other perfect targets.

1293
01:25:42,391 --> 01:25:45,546
The Golden Gate Bridge, the Space Needle.
There is no chatter to support this.

1294
01:25:45,951 --> 01:25:48,178
You know what? As a matter of...
 I'm, I'm done with this. Stop!

1295
01:25:48,663 --> 01:25:50,219
Wait a minute 23!

1296
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:51,906
You're radioactive hot.

1297
01:25:52,224 --> 01:25:55,800
-When would you have been exposed to radioactivity?
-I just got back from Russia!

1298
01:25:55,865 --> 01:25:57,635
Half the people there are radioactive...

1299
01:25:57,898 --> 01:25:58,815
The bakery...

1300
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:02,006
-You said that you swept the whole area and that everything was clean.
-I did.

1301
01:26:02,297 --> 01:26:03,921
-And it was!
-Really?

1302
01:26:03,987 --> 01:26:06,578
Was there anyone else there,
or do we just have to trust you?

1303
01:26:07,364 --> 01:26:08,148
23?

1304
01:26:09,117 --> 01:26:11,003
Your knife wound is seeping...

1305
01:26:11,536 --> 01:26:13,112
Sudden rise in blood pressure?

1306
01:26:13,195 --> 01:26:14,115
Perhaps you're nervous?

1307
01:26:14,179 --> 01:26:16,721
Nervous, because there is
a bomb here and you know it!

1308
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:18,128
And what is with the briefcase?

1309
01:26:18,202 --> 01:26:20,344
-Could that actually be the football?
-If by the football,

1310
01:26:20,345 --> 01:26:22,690
You mean the computer containing
the bomb activation codes?

1311
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,212
That is exactly what I mean.
I have no interest in a real football,

1312
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:28,664
unless it is signed by Joe Montana
 And I don't believe that is the case here.

1313
01:26:30,459 --> 01:26:31,977
Well 23?

1314
01:26:33,284 --> 01:26:34,516
You know what?

1315
01:26:34,777 --> 01:26:36,482
We're out of time...

1316
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,641
You follow us, and she dies!

1317
01:26:47,345 --> 01:26:49,212
Stop this car!

1318
01:26:50,136 --> 01:26:51,412
Max!
You idiot!

1319
01:26:51,491 --> 01:26:53,155
What the hell is wrong with you?

1320
01:26:53,365 --> 01:26:55,854
You don't just slap your hands
on a government vehicle!

1321
01:26:57,036 --> 01:26:59,220
Hey!
Alright, that's it!

1322
01:26:59,338 --> 01:27:00,802
When we get back to Washington,

1323
01:27:00,855 --> 01:27:02,414
You morons are through!

1324
01:27:05,521 --> 01:27:06,291
Damn it!

1325
01:27:06,686 --> 01:27:08,721
How have you gotten
away with this for so long?

1326
01:27:08,799 --> 01:27:11,005
I can't believe none of us saw it.
Especially me!

1327
01:27:11,057 --> 01:27:14,044
Aw, don't beat yourself up,
you'll be dead soon anyway.

1328
01:27:16,072 --> 01:27:18,010
Chief, he's heading southbound on Grant.

1329
01:27:18,154 --> 01:27:20,276
Thanks Bruce.
Keep us posted!

1330
01:27:20,315 --> 01:27:23,027
Hey, CONTROL assholes
Who just stole my vehicle.

1331
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:24,290
I know you're listening!

1332
01:27:24,807 --> 01:27:27,756
You two dickwads
put on scratch on that car!

1333
01:27:28,932 --> 01:27:31,539
-What was that?
-Sorry, I'm loosing you...

1334
01:27:35,567 --> 01:27:37,988
Alright fellows,
20 dollars if you hit the car!

1335
01:27:39,499 --> 01:27:41,096
Chief, I have to say...

1336
01:27:41,097 --> 01:27:43,286
This whole thing really stings my plans.

1337
01:27:43,311 --> 01:27:47,006
-I cannot get over the fact that 23 is a traitor.
-Sand trap!

1338
01:27:47,544 --> 01:27:50,753
Now I know how you must have felt when
you thought I was the traitor. It is desmoralizing.

1339
01:27:50,886 --> 01:27:51,839
Tractor!

1340
01:27:52,913 --> 01:27:54,959
I don't know how I missed it,
I'm usually very observant!

1341
01:27:55,058 --> 01:27:56,646
Sword fish!

1342
01:28:03,558 --> 01:28:04,974
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1343
01:28:05,092 --> 01:28:06,178
I don't know.
Were you thinking:

1344
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:07,491
"Holy shit, holy shit,

1345
01:28:07,492 --> 01:28:09,676
A fish-sword almost
went through my head "?

1346
01:28:09,752 --> 01:28:11,141
If so, yes!

1347
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:12,269
Come on!

1348
01:28:33,764 --> 01:28:37,212
On behalf of the United States gavernment,
I hearby comandeer this plane!

1349
01:28:38,169 --> 01:28:40,181
The device is armed.
I hope you're moving.

1350
01:28:40,233 --> 01:28:43,688
Don't worry sir,
I will be well clear.

1351
01:28:46,837 --> 01:28:49,992
-Chief, they're headed south-bound on I-47!
-Thanks Bruce!

1352
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:51,337
I've got them!

1353
01:28:52,039 --> 01:28:54,510
-I need to get down to that car!
-No, no good!

1354
01:28:54,607 --> 01:28:56,739
If go too low, he'll hear me coming.

1355
01:29:00,489 --> 01:29:01,929
I have another idea!

1356
01:29:03,406 --> 01:29:04,392
What are you doing?

1357
01:29:07,018 --> 01:29:09,974
Get back in the plane,
you're going to kill yourself out there!

1358
01:29:11,027 --> 01:29:11,914
Hang on!

1359
01:29:28,444 --> 01:29:29,780
Hang on.
We're going in.

1360
01:29:34,581 --> 01:29:35,694
Sorry, Max!

1361
01:29:40,763 --> 01:29:43,199
-But Tuesday's not going to work. Cannot do tuesday.
-Mom!

1362
01:29:43,225 --> 01:29:45,585
-Mom, Mom, Mom!
-Shawn, Shawn, Shawn!

1363
01:29:45,649 --> 01:29:47,810
See how annoying that is?

1364
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:08,771
See,
this is your problem!

1365
01:30:08,863 --> 01:30:11,771
-Some men like women who are feminine!
-Wha... I'm not feminine?

1366
01:30:11,898 --> 01:30:12,729
No!

1367
01:30:12,794 --> 01:30:14,210
I'm not feminine?

1368
01:30:24,339 --> 01:30:25,072
Freeze!

1369
01:30:25,992 --> 01:30:27,624
That was so cool!

1370
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,014
Damn it to hell!

1371
01:30:47,946 --> 01:30:49,896
You know, I might be more
help if you untie me!

1372
01:30:49,912 --> 01:30:52,992
There is a knife in
my right front pocket.

1373
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:00,912
Stop, stop, stop!

1374
01:31:01,006 --> 01:31:03,931
-What? What is it?
-That's not my knife...

1375
01:31:04,114 --> 01:31:05,207
That's not my...

1376
01:31:05,977 --> 01:31:07,407
I got it!

1377
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:15,691
99,
don't touch that!

1378
01:31:18,505 --> 01:31:19,866
Oh My Lord.

1379
01:31:41,249 --> 01:31:43,156
The kid's still got it!

1380
01:31:48,075 --> 01:31:49,883
Max, hurry!

1381
01:31:51,123 --> 01:31:52,804
Hold on 99!

1382
01:31:58,645 --> 01:31:59,353
Chief!

1383
01:31:59,406 --> 01:32:00,556
We can't stop the car!

1384
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:02,676
We have the football, but we 
do not know the code!

1385
01:32:02,677 --> 01:32:06,394
We need to figure out something soon, this tractor's
taking us back downtown toward the bomb.

1386
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,762
You gotta get out of there!
You won't survive the jump.

1387
01:32:13,837 --> 01:32:15,054
I'm coming to get you!

1388
01:32:39,761 --> 01:32:40,797
Hold on 99!

1389
01:32:42,699 --> 01:32:43,662
Its not over Max!

1390
01:32:43,764 --> 01:32:46,292
-I'll take that briefcase.
-If you want it,

1391
01:32:46,323 --> 01:32:48,799
-You'll have to take it!
-That's what I just said!

1392
01:32:49,066 --> 01:32:51,388
I know, I'm just trying
to annoy you.

1393
01:33:37,336 --> 01:33:39,344
Unusual, but effective.

1394
01:33:46,858 --> 01:33:48,666
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

1395
01:33:55,144 --> 01:33:55,863
Max!

1396
01:33:57,226 --> 01:33:58,523
Max, your foot!

1397
01:34:03,534 --> 01:34:05,595
I wish, we had more time...

1398
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:27,286
Max!

1399
01:34:28,219 --> 01:34:28,894
No!

1400
01:34:48,891 --> 01:34:50,256
Oh Max...

1401
01:34:56,407 --> 01:34:57,379
No...

1402
01:35:03,455 --> 01:35:05,488
I wish we
had more time too...

1403
01:35:08,066 --> 01:35:09,603
So, you did hear me?

1404
01:35:12,752 --> 01:35:13,513
Max!

1405
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,644
But the train...

1406
01:35:20,126 --> 01:35:22,108
Missed it by that much.

1407
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:42,490
"Operation Joy"

1408
01:35:44,354 --> 01:35:48,109
"The Ode to Joy, will end with a bang"

1409
01:35:52,766 --> 01:35:53,813
Chief!

1410
01:35:54,152 --> 01:35:55,813
Yeah Maxie.
Are you ok?

1411
01:35:55,892 --> 01:35:59,996
Listen, I think the final notes of
The Ode of Joy trigger the bomb.

1412
01:36:00,167 --> 01:36:02,800
-We have to stop the concert!
-I'm on it...

1413
01:36:37,577 --> 01:36:40,948
My buttocks are really
stinging from being dragged.

1414
01:36:50,473 --> 01:36:52,809
Hey, grandpa.
I already told you...

1415
01:36:53,489 --> 01:36:56,318
Speak up son,
I'm an old man you know?

1416
01:37:07,346 --> 01:37:08,995
I liked that tackling part!

1417
01:37:13,611 --> 01:37:15,943
I am so, so sorry about that.

1418
01:37:16,167 --> 01:37:18,212
Wait, wait, wait.
Let him go.

1419
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,886
-There was a bomb.
-Where?

1420
01:37:21,088 --> 01:37:22,592
Would you believe...

1421
01:37:22,954 --> 01:37:24,073
...in the piano?

1422
01:37:29,495 --> 01:37:31,921
Whoa, how did we miss that?
It is huge...

1423
01:37:32,039 --> 01:37:32,796
Max...

1424
01:37:33,412 --> 01:37:35,813
-Was that...
-A total guess. Yes it was.

1425
01:37:44,099 --> 01:37:45,985
That old son of a gun
can take a hit, huh!

1426
01:37:54,023 --> 01:37:58,140
-Do you think I should tell him?
-No, let's just savor the moment.

1427
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,609
He's a funny sumbitch.

1428
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:11,624
This is the proudest moment of my life!

1429
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:17,756
-The bomb not go off.
-Oh really bright eyes?

1430
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:18,974
What alerted you?

1431
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,910
Was it no boom-boom?
Or the lack of a mushroom-cloud?

1432
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:24,528
It was the mushroom-cloud
for me.

1433
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:28,095
Well, you did your job.

1434
01:38:28,363 --> 01:38:30,664
So, I suppose I can't
kill your wife...

1435
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:33,866
Though, to be honest, I'd be
doing the sighted world a favor.

1436
01:38:42,068 --> 01:38:44,724
Good hang time huh?

1437
01:38:44,929 --> 01:38:46,130
Yes, Mr. President!

1438
01:38:46,496 --> 01:38:47,992
Thank you and good bye sir!

1439
01:38:48,358 --> 01:38:51,605
86, the President wanted me to
convey his personal thanks.

1440
01:38:51,606 --> 01:38:55,612
And to tell you how enormously impressed he
was with that whole "dragged by a train" thing!

1441
01:38:55,708 --> 01:38:57,187
Ah, well sir, as an agent

1442
01:38:57,188 --> 01:38:59,367
I have trained myself
to be impervious to pain.

1443
01:39:02,972 --> 01:39:04,898
I wanted him to be a surprise...

1444
01:39:05,872 --> 01:39:08,802
99, please. Nobody here
knows that we're dating.

1445
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,253
Yes they do.

1446
01:39:11,755 --> 01:39:12,908
On the cheek...

1447
01:39:14,123 --> 01:39:15,625
Give me just a little one...

1448
01:39:16,705 --> 01:39:17,906
Hey, New Guy!

1449
01:39:18,105 --> 01:39:20,559
Hold up a second...
Welcome to CONTROL!

1450
01:39:20,678 --> 01:39:23,823
We have a tradition here. It's called
"pick on the new guy." And here's how it works.

1451
01:39:23,995 --> 01:39:26,748
-We pick on the new guy.
-And you can't do anything about it.

1452
01:39:26,787 --> 01:39:28,084
Let's try one.

1453
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:30,675
You dropped your pencil.

1454
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:32,288
Did you hear the man?

1455
01:39:32,503 --> 01:39:35,079
I don't see a man.
I see two little girls.

1456
01:39:36,225 --> 01:39:39,499
I think I'll call you Marine
and you Britney.

1457
01:39:39,551 --> 01:39:42,692
-The new guy did not...
-The new guy did...

1458
01:39:42,824 --> 01:39:44,570
Ok new guy, I got this.

1459
01:39:45,414 --> 01:39:48,346
-And I'm going to enjoy it.
-That will make me happy Marine!

1460
01:39:49,558 --> 01:39:50,529
Marine...

1461
01:39:53,748 --> 01:39:55,004
Just for the record...

1462
01:39:56,669 --> 01:39:58,309
My name is not new guy,

1463
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:03,090
My name is Hymie.
Now, if you ladies will excuse me...

1464
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:08,528
-This is going to be so fun.
-Make him high five me.

1465
01:40:41,783 --> 01:40:43,184
Max, we're going to be late.

1466
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,443
Oh Max, let maintenance
take care of it.

1467
01:40:55,044 --> 01:40:57,544
You've gotta be kidding me!

1468
01:40:58,945 --> 01:41:01,145
