1
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:44,426
<i>~ You walk in a room</i>

2
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:47,972
<i>~ A woman can feel the heat</i>

3
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:51,559
<i>~ One look is a guarantee</i>

4
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:56,272
<i>~ Nights could be long and sweet</i>

5
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:59,358
<i>~ The message is clear</i>

6
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:03,028
<i>~ Like nothing I’ve ever known</i>

7
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,824
<i>~ But from all that I hear</i>

8
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,411
<i>~ Forget about long-range plans</i>

9
00:01:10,494 --> 00:01:14,582
<i>~ Cos this man's got his own</i>

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,339
<i>~ To get mixed up with
a man who says never</i>

11
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:30,347
<i>~ May be big trouble, but then</i>

12
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:37,521
<i>~ I just could be the woman to take you</i>

13
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:43,569
<i>~ And make you never say never again</i>

14
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:46,906
<i>~ Never, never say never again</i>

15
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:50,701
<i>~ Never, never say never again</i>

16
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,413
<i>~ Never, never say never again</i>

17
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,375
<i>~ Never, never say never again</i>

18
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,504
<i>~ You've got all the moves</i>

19
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:05,049
<i>~ Ah, but baby I got 'em too</i>

20
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:10,596
<i>~ No matter your attitude or your mood</i>

21
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,474
<i>~ I’ll come through</i>

22
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:17,144
<i>~ The touch of your voice</i>

23
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:20,272
<i>~ The feel of your eyes on me</i>

24
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,984
<i>~ You leave me no choice</i>

25
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,488
<i>~ Though I know there's danger there</i>

26
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:31,784
<i>~ I don't care, let it be</i>

27
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:39,708
<i>~ To get in bed with
a man who says never</i>

28
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:47,424
<i>~ May have no future, but then</i>

29
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:54,557
<i>~ I just could be the woman to reach you</i>

30
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,396
<i>~ And teach you to never say never again</i>

31
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,651
<i>~ I’ll bet you, I’ll get you</i>

32
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:09,405
<i>~ I’ll reach you, I’ll teach you</i>

33
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:15,828
<i>~ I’ll take you, I’ll make you</i>

34
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:37,827
One minute, 47 seconds, sir.

35
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:41,997
- Not too shabby, sir.
- But dead, 007. Dead!

36
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,669
You should have studied
the plot more carefully.

37
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:50,798
Fanatical revolutionaries
kidnap a millionaire's daughter.

38
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:54,760
Of course she could have been
brainwashed. Could have turned.

39
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:57,972
- Evidently she did.
- With due respect, sir...

40
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:00,975
...I played for two weeks
and I only got killed once.

41
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:03,811
Twice. The land mine
on the Black Sea beach.

42
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:06,647
Correction, sir:
I lost both legs. I did not die.

43
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,233
You were immobilised.

44
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:13,571
It can never be the same
playing with blanks.

45
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:16,031
<i>It is somewhat different in the field.</i>

46
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:20,619
With your life on the line, you...
Well, your adrenaline gives you an edge.

47
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:25,082
Is your edge sharp? That's the difference
between a double-0 and a corpse.

48
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:29,545
Since you took over, sir,
you've had little use for the double-0s.

49
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:32,548
I've spent most of my time teaching...

50
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,967
...not doing.
- Oh, I'll make you no secret.

51
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,805
I hold your methods in much less regard
than my illustrious predecessor did.

52
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,224
But my duty is to keep you up to par.

53
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,938
Too many free radicals,
that's your problem.

54
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:52,693
- Free radicals, sir?
- Toxins that destroy the body and brain.

55
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:57,990
Caused by eating too much red meat and
white bread, and too many dry martinis.

56
00:05:58,073 --> 00:06:02,411
- Then I shall cut out the white bread, sir.
- You'll do more than that, 007.

57
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,790
From now on, you will be suffering
a strict regimen of diet and exercise.

58
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:10,544
We shall purge those toxins from you.

59
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:12,922
- Shrublands?
- You've got it.

60
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:21,180
- Have you got an assignment, James?
- Yes. Yes, Moneypenny.

61
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:25,768
I'm to eliminate all free radicals.

62
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,562
Oh!

63
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:30,731
Do be careful.

64
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,248
- Welcome to Shrublands, sir.
- Thank you.

65
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:51,293
My word. They don't make them
like this any more.

66
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:55,172
It's still in pretty good shape.
- This way, sir.

67
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:58,509
Your body's got enough
scar tissue for an entire regiment.

68
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:03,722
- Right... But it's still in pretty good shape.
- We'll be the judge of that, Mr Bond.

69
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:07,518
Our job is not just to rehabilitate you.
It's to re-educate you.

70
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:12,815
I want to open your mind to the virtues of
nutrition, proper exercise, meditation...

71
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:15,401
...and, hopefully, spiritual enlightenment.

72
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:19,613
I'd like you to see the iridologist at four,
have a colonic at five...

73
00:07:19,697 --> 00:07:24,910
...and then you can cut along to the
light-dining room for a cup of parsley tea.

74
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:31,041
Mr Bond, I need a urine sample.
If you could fill this beaker for me...

75
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,835
From here?

76
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:39,216
<i>Bonjour.</i>

77
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,304
<i>- Box 274 and quickly, please.
- Ah, oui. Suivez-moi.</i>

78
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:43,948
We have invested extensively in
the Middle East and Central America...

79
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,700
...to promote insurgency and revolution.

80
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:51,997
Fortunately our capital outlay
has been handsomely offset...

81
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:57,378
...by the resultant sales
of armaments and missiles.

82
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:03,717
You will note that we have supplied
both rebels and government forces...

83
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,761
...on an equal basis.

84
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:11,100
In matters of death,
SPECTRE is strictly impartial.

85
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:18,482
Now for the future. SPECTRE's
most audacious enterprise of any...

86
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:22,862
...next to which our previous
ventures are inconsequential.

87
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:27,950
Our esteemed Number One is in
complete charge of the entire operation...

88
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:32,329
...which will henceforth
be called "The Tears of Allah".

89
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:35,624
He will now join us.

90
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,298
According to plans,
an American air-force officer...

91
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:47,136
...has been introduced
to a cruel mistress: Heroin.

92
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:51,599
I understand he is now
our willing and obedient servant.

93
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:54,602
<i>A surgical operation
has been performed on him.</i>

94
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:57,104
<i>As a result of a corneal implant...</i>

95
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:02,151
<i>... his right-eye print is an exact replica of
that of the president of the United States.</i>

96
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:07,531
<i>He will soon be moved to
a convalescent clinic near London.</i>

97
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:10,784
<i>I have chosen Number 12
to have the responsibility...</i>

98
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:14,288
<i>... of taking the most tender loving care...</i>

99
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:17,291
<i>... of Captain Jack Petachi.</i>

100
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:30,095
I beg your pardon.
Is there no speed limit here?

101
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:34,725
She's not staff. She must be
one of those private nurses.

102
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,185
My name is Bond.

103
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,814
<i>Oh, you're Mr Bond!
I believe I'm having you in half an hour.</i>

104
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:43,108
- Oh, splendid! Your room or mine?
- Mine.

105
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:50,616
<i>- (crunch)
- That's it.</i>

106
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:54,328
OK, now just move back on
the couch for me, please. That's it.

107
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:58,749
Let's have this arm on the shoulder.
This one... no, underneath there. Good.

108
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,918
OK, now just relax.

109
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:13,055
Yes, there are slight lesions
of the thoracic vertebrae.

110
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,641
Now, if you just hold still...

111
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:21,063
Yes. Some sacroiliac strain
at the base of the spine.

112
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,733
<i>There is a more beneficial
therapy for a man's lower back.</i>

113
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,986
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

114
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,155
And what might that be?

115
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:56,056
<i>(knock at door)</i>

116
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:11,864
I thought I'd... surprise you, James.

117
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:14,783
Well, you have. Come in.

118
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:19,497
No, no. I can't come in. You know if they
found me here they'd fire me on the spot.

119
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,585
<i>I won't let anyone find you. Don't worry.
I have my reputation to think of.</i>

120
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:29,882
<i>I don't think you got your reputation
by living on a diet of wild rice. So...</i>

121
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:33,177
Lentil delight. Dandelion salad.

122
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:36,096
Goat's cheese.

123
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:41,644
Beluga caviar. Quail's eggs. Vodka.

124
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:45,439
Foie gras.

125
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:50,277
Strasbourg.

126
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:56,033
<i>(TV) In question time
at the House of Commons...</i>

127
00:12:56,116 --> 00:13:00,246
<i>... the minister said that local authorities
should be given far wider...</i>

128
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:17,721
<i>(sniffs)</i>

129
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:21,475
Jack's been smoking again!

130
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:27,731
Jack was ordered not to smoke.

131
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,530
Smoking is dirty.

132
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:37,449
It gets into Jack's eye.

133
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,125
Jack must do as he's told if he wants
his fast cars and his pretty clothes.

134
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:51,172
- And if he wants to keep his sister alive...
- You leave Domino out of this!

135
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,682
Mmm. James?

136
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:18,491
Get up!

137
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,670
Now let's just take a look, shall we?

138
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,050
Ah! Very good.

139
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:42,097
With a contact lens
both eyes will look exactly the same.

140
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,687
Now, darling must do
his little trickie in eight seconds.

141
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,442
Then nursie will give baby his candy.

142
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,111
Mm?

143
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:21,720
P... three... four... one...

144
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,644
<i>(to himself) Come on, Jack!</i>

145
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:32,606
- Oh, damn!
- Try it again, darling!

146
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:40,364
- Who's that?
- A man!

147
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,950
- At the window!
- Don't move.

148
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:50,082
- Did he see you?
I don't know.

149
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,335
I guess he could have.

150
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:03,137
<i>- (Jack) Do you know him?
- Oh, yes!</i>

151
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,848
007.

152
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:17,902
Good morning, Mr Bond. Miss Fearing
tells me you're making fine progress.

153
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:19,778
Oh, yes.

154
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:23,491
But I must say, you're looking
a bit peaked this morning.

155
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:26,285
I was up all night.
- Don't overdo it.

156
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:28,871
A herbal enema should fix you up.

157
00:16:29,497 --> 00:16:33,209
Thank you... Sounds terrific(!)

158
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,883

I am supreme commander of SPECTRE...

207

...the Special Executive
for Counterintelligence...

208
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,731
...Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion.

209
00:31:31,273 --> 00:31:34,068
<i>Yesterday morning
the American air force...</i>

210
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:39,365
<i>...launched two cruise missiles
from Swadley air base in Great Britain.</i>

211
00:31:39,448 --> 00:31:43,702
<i>Through the ingenuity of SPECTRE,
the dummy warheads they carried...</i>

212
00:31:43,786 --> 00:31:47,123
<i>... were replaced with
live nuclear warheads.</i>

213
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:52,545
<i>Your weapons of destruction
are now safely in our possession...</i>

214
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:55,881
<i>... and will be moved to two secret targets.</i>

215
00:31:56,757 --> 00:32:02,179
<i>Please note the serial numbers of
the missiles. They will confirm the truth.</i>

216
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:07,560
<i>Your weapons of deterrence
did not deter us from our objective.</i>

217
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:11,647
<i>A terrible catastrophe now confronts you.</i>

218
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:18,821
<i>However, it can be avoided by
paying a tribute to our organisation...</i>

219
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:25,161
<i>... amounting to 25% of your respective
countries' annual oil purchases.</i>

220
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:31,083
<i>We have accomplished two of the
functions the name SPECTRE embodies:</i>

221
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,794
<i>Terror and extortion.</i>

222
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:41,135
<i>- Lf our demands are not met within seven
days, we shall ruthlessly deploy the third:</i>

223
00:32:41,218 --> 00:32:43,387
<i>Revenge.</i>

224
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,602
<i>(delegates shout and argue)</i>

225
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:58,527
That would be $25 billion a year!

226
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:04,533
Order!

227
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:07,244
This would destabilise
the monetary system!

228
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,039
I call this meeting to order!

229
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:14,794
The foreign secretary wishes
to address you! Lord Ambrose.

230
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:20,758
Gentlemen, we are faced
with the ultimate nightmare:

231
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:23,385
The abduction of nuclear warheads.

232
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,555
But how is this possible?

233
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:30,142
Up to now, our procedures
relating to nuclear hardware...

234
00:33:30,226 --> 00:33:32,812
...have been absolutely foolproof.

235
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:40,152
I hope the American government realises
its awesome responsibility in this matter!

236
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:43,989
NATO has a joint responsibility
to solve this problem.

237
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:48,285
But if this gets out,
it will cause worldwide panic!

238
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:51,122
How well has this information
been contained?

239
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:53,624
Apart from those present in this room...

240
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:57,378
...the information resides only with
the CIA and British Intelligence.

241
00:33:57,461 --> 00:34:01,632
Wonderful(!) That means
by now it's all over the Kremlin!

242
00:34:04,802 --> 00:34:08,889
I know your feelings, M,
but I insist you reactivate the double-0s.

243
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:11,058
As you wish, sir.

244
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:25,322
<i>Maximillian Largo, born Bucharest, 1945.</i>

245
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:27,825
<i>Industrialist and philanthropist.</i>

246
00:34:27,908 --> 00:34:32,037
<i>Resident Nassau, Bahamas.
No known criminal associations.</i>

247
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:35,416
You still here, Moneypenny?
You should be in bed.

248
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:40,212
James, we both should be.
Instead I'm looking everywhere for you.

249
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:45,676
Forget that. M wants to see you right now.
It's panic stations upstairs.

250
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:50,514
He's been with the prime minister all day.
I think you're back in business, James.

251
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,479
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Morning!

252
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:42,983
- The latest reports? Everything OK?
- Yes, sir.

253
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:47,571
- Morning.
- Morning, Charles.

254
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:57,414
In secret, the Americans are
trying to trace the missile...

255
00:35:57,498 --> 00:35:59,416
...on their eastern seaboard.

256
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,462
The other allegedly threatens
the oilfields of the Middle East.

257
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:06,215
How well protected are they from the air?

258
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:10,344
Everyone's collaborating.
The Americans, NATO, the Japanese...

259
00:36:10,427 --> 00:36:13,806
They're putting up an air screen
a mosquito couldn't get through.

260
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:17,935
Our concern is that the warhead
may already be in position.

261
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:22,690
The worst devastation would result
from a subterranean explosion.

262
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:25,693
You see, the oil-bearing strata
in the area...

263
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:28,988
Interconnected by
a surprisingly delicate structure.

264
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:31,574
It would be a sort of ripple effect.

265
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:35,703
What's the Americans' story
on how the damn things were stolen?

266
00:36:35,786 --> 00:36:38,956
The release of ALCMs
has to come from the president.

267
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:44,712
Even that has safeguards. It can only be
authorised after a scan of his right eye.

268
00:36:44,795 --> 00:36:48,048
The only irregularity is that
a communications officer...

269
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:53,971
...unofficially left the base at the time
of launch. A certain Captain Jack Petachi.

270
00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:56,515
If this Petachi was involved...

271
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,895
...is it conceivable that
he could have used a false eye?

272
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:03,481
Oh, do come along, Bond!

273
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:06,650
Let's think of a more
logical explanation, shall we?

274
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:22,708
<i>OK, let's run through
that routine from yesterday.</i>

275
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:25,294
<i>(slow dance music)</i>

276
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,764
- Let's go again.
- OK.

277
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:21,350
Four, five, six, seven, down.

278
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:39,034
<i>(piano)</i>

279
00:38:39,118 --> 00:38:41,203
Max!

280
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,628
As usual, I have left you
alone too long, I know.

281
00:38:50,754 --> 00:38:53,591
But I brought you a gift.

282
00:38:53,674 --> 00:38:56,260
I don't want any more gifts.

283
00:38:56,343 --> 00:38:59,096
I just want you. That's all I want.

284
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,391
I know, but this is different.

285
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,768
- Look. Look.
- Oh, Max!

286
00:39:08,022 --> 00:39:11,150
- What is it?
It’s very old.

287
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:16,447
Oh!

288
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:21,243
- What's the inscription?
- Arabic. "The Tears of Allah."

289
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,790
The story is that the prophet wept
for the barrenness of the desert...

290
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:28,292
...and his tears made a well.
- Mmm.

291
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:32,963
It's a legend, of course,
but like all great legends...

292
00:39:33,047 --> 00:39:35,549
...it is also the truth.

293
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:45,184
It is the most valuable thing...

294
00:39:46,602 --> 00:39:48,938
...I have ever possessed.

295
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:51,106
Except you.

296
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,275
Hmmm.

297
00:39:56,028 --> 00:40:00,491
- And you trust me to wear it?
- A safer place I couldn't imagine.

298
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:07,248
<i>- And what if I ever leave you?
- (plays discordant notes)</i>

299
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:16,632
No, really!

300
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:19,218
Then I cut your throat.

301
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:06,015
Nice to know even old Q can surprise
one of you double-0s occasionally.

302
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:08,976
Algernon!

303
00:41:10,478 --> 00:41:12,980
Not quite perfected yet.

304
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:17,651
You could write a very
binding contract with this.

305
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:21,697
Yeah, I wish I had a new contract.
They've slashed my budget.

306
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,244
You can't get the spare parts. And when
you can, some strike stops delivery.

307
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:31,165
And look at this place!
They keep it bloody freezing down here!

308
00:41:31,248 --> 00:41:33,334
Plays havoc with my sinuses.

309
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:35,795
We're both humble servants of the Crown.

310
00:41:35,878 --> 00:41:38,923
If the CIA made me an offer,
I'd be off like a shot.

311
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:42,259
Unlimited resources, air conditioning...

312
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:45,888
...28 flavours of ice cream
in the restaurant.

313
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:51,310
It's a motorbike toy. If I can get the thing
to work properly, I'll ship it out to you.

314
00:41:51,393 --> 00:41:55,397
Wait a minute! I've got something
in here that could be useful.

315
00:41:55,481 --> 00:42:01,403
The prototype came from a KGB defector.
Bit of a whiz kid in their technical section.

316
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:06,075
Not a bad chap, though like
all defectors, prone to melancholy.

317
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:09,703
I suppose it's all that vodka
and English weather.

318
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:11,872
Ah.

319
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:17,044
Rather tasty, this is.
It looks like a watch, but it's really a laser.

320
00:42:17,128 --> 00:42:19,964
- Keeps perfect time.
- But for how long?

321
00:42:21,382 --> 00:42:23,676
<i>At least your lifetime.</i>

322
00:42:25,594 --> 00:42:30,057
Good to see you, Mr Bond.
Things have been awfully dull round here.

323
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:33,185
Bureaucrats running the place,
things done by the book.

324
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:36,730
Can't make a decision unless
the computer gives you the go-ahead.

325
00:42:36,814 --> 00:42:41,152
Now you're on this, I hope we're going to
have some gratuitous sex and violence.

326
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:44,989
I certainly hope so too. What is this for?

327
00:42:46,365 --> 00:42:49,452
I'll show you. You unscrew it...

328
00:42:50,286 --> 00:42:52,913
...then stick it up your nose.

329
00:42:53,581 --> 00:42:57,585
It’s for my sinus.
- Well, I won't need one where I'm going.

330
00:42:57,668 --> 00:43:01,088
Where's that,
or are you not allowed to say?

331
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:04,884
- The Bahamas.
- Lucky bloody you!

332
00:43:32,578 --> 00:43:35,706
- Oh, sorry!
- That's perfectly all right.

333
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:44,840
- What are you hoping to catch?
- Something about 6'2", 190lb...

334
00:43:44,924 --> 00:43:48,677
...with brown eyes.
- Well, why bother going to sea?

335
00:43:51,722 --> 00:43:54,642
- Let me help you.
- Mr Bond!

336
00:43:56,977 --> 00:44:00,147
I say, Mr Bond!
- Catch you later, perhaps.

337
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:01,398
Right.

338
00:44:05,694 --> 00:44:10,157
Nigel Small-Fawcett,
British Embassy, Nassau.

339
00:44:10,241 --> 00:44:13,160
- How do you do, Nigel?
- Sorry I'm late.

340
00:44:13,244 --> 00:44:17,665
As you're an undercover johnny, I took
the precaution of not being followed.

341
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:20,584
That's why you shouted
my name across the harbour?

342
00:44:20,668 --> 00:44:23,712
Oh, God, did I? Oh, I'm sorry.

343
00:44:23,796 --> 00:44:26,715
Damn! Damn!

344
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:29,385
Sorry. I'm rather new to all this.

345
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:34,390
- What's the score with Largo?
- He's highly visible here.

346
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:38,227
Enormously wealthy.
Owns the biggest boat in the Caribbean.

347
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,355
Spends a lot of his time
at a place called Bluebeard Reef.

348
00:44:41,438 --> 00:44:43,440
Marine archaeology, I gather.

349
00:44:43,524 --> 00:44:45,985
- You've met him?
- Oh, yes. He's charming.

350
00:44:46,068 --> 00:44:50,531
I mean... foreign,
but charming nonetheless.

351
00:44:50,614 --> 00:44:54,660
He donates a lot of money to worthy
causes. He built a maritime museum...

352
00:44:54,743 --> 00:44:59,165
...and a new wing for the orphanage.
I'm sure he's very kind to his mother.

353
00:44:59,248 --> 00:45:01,750
Don't know his mother.

354
00:45:03,544 --> 00:45:06,255
You're not going to make
any trouble, are you?

355
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:08,966
Let's face it,
your reputation has preceded you.

356
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:12,344
- Do I look like I would make trouble?
- Well, yes, frankly.

357
00:45:12,428 --> 00:45:16,182
You'll jeopardise the tourist trade
if you go around killing people.

358
00:45:16,265 --> 00:45:18,893
Nigel, please. Just go back to your desk.

359
00:45:18,976 --> 00:45:24,023
Find out where Largo's boat is at the
moment. Call me later. I'll be at my hotel.

360
00:45:24,106 --> 00:45:27,026
Jolly good. I'll get onto that at once.

361
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:32,615
And take full advantage
of the natural cover.

362
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:49,048
<i>Is this The Flying Saucer?
- Yeah. It sailed this morning.</i>

363
00:46:33,134 --> 00:46:35,219
<i>(screams)</i>

364
00:46:36,804 --> 00:46:38,889
Oh!

365
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:43,477
How reckless of me! I made you all wet.

366
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:46,814
Yes, but my martini's still dry.
My name's James.

367
00:46:46,897 --> 00:46:50,151
Hello, James. I'm Fatima Blush.

368
00:46:50,234 --> 00:46:52,319
You ski very well.

369
00:46:52,403 --> 00:46:54,572
I do many things very well.

370
00:46:54,655 --> 00:46:56,740
I'm sure you do.

371
00:47:00,202 --> 00:47:03,247
- What brings you to Nassau, James?
I’m fishing.

372
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,833
- For what?
- Anything I can get.

373
00:47:06,709 --> 00:47:11,922
I know the best waters.
I'd be very happy to show them to you.

374
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:13,632
Why would you do that?

375
00:47:13,716 --> 00:47:16,844
I'd like you to find what you're looking for.

376
00:47:20,473 --> 00:47:22,933
I'm all yours.

377
00:47:28,397 --> 00:47:31,775
- Yes?
- James, would you come down please?

378
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:33,944
Right away.

379
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:45,873
Ah! I think this should
take care of you perfectly.

380
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:48,417
Oh, I'm sure it will.

381
00:47:48,501 --> 00:47:52,171
- You're marvellously well-equipped.
- Thank you, James.

382
00:47:53,464 --> 00:47:56,759
- So are you.
- Thank you.

383
00:47:57,927 --> 00:48:00,888
What exactly are we going down for?

384
00:48:01,555 --> 00:48:04,683
Sport... and a little fun.

385
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:10,064
You, uh... you appear tense.

386
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,692
You affect me, James.

387
00:48:14,985 --> 00:48:17,071
Well, that's bad.

388
00:48:17,822 --> 00:48:21,117
Going down,
one should always be relaxed.

389
00:48:23,244 --> 00:48:25,412
Is it far to the reef?

390
00:48:25,496 --> 00:48:27,581
It's far enough.

391
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:31,377
We've got time to kill.

392
00:49:39,737 --> 00:49:41,697
<i>(beeping)</i>

393
00:50:28,702 --> 00:50:30,996
<i>(beeping)</i>

394
00:53:29,508 --> 00:53:33,345
It’s you!
- Well, you did say you'd catch me later.

395
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:35,514
<i>(calypso music)</i>

396
00:53:53,783 --> 00:53:56,327
Oh, my God!

00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,504
- 623 and, uh...
- 728.

398
00:54:48,587 --> 00:54:50,673
728.

399
00:54:52,007 --> 00:54:54,677
Here you are. No messages.

400
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,955
<i>(phone rings)</i>

401
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:30,713
<i>- Hello?
- Mr Bond! I’ve finally tracked you down!</i>

402
00:55:30,796 --> 00:55:34,884
Small-Fawcett here. I hope I haven't
caught you at an awkward moment.

403
00:55:34,967 --> 00:55:39,013
No, not at all. Just be brief.
I don't have too much time.

404
00:55:39,096 --> 00:55:41,891
<i>Just want you to know
that I’m on top of things.</i>

405
00:55:41,974 --> 00:55:46,479
I've found out that Largo's boat is
en route for the south of France.

406
00:55:46,562 --> 00:55:49,440
- Well done.
- Oh, it was nothing, really.

407
00:55:49,523 --> 00:55:52,651
If you're free tomorrow,
why don't we go snorkelling?

408
00:55:52,735 --> 00:55:56,447
<i>- Sounds a wonderful idea.
- Oh, jolly good, Bond!</i>

409
00:55:58,783 --> 00:56:01,118
<i>Because I was wanting
to discuss with you...</i>

410
00:56:05,581 --> 00:56:08,083
- What's that?
- Mr Bond?!

411
00:56:10,002 --> 00:56:13,923
- Proof that we made the right decision.
- About what, darling?

412
00:56:14,006 --> 00:56:16,091
Your place or mine.

413
00:57:04,974 --> 00:57:08,352
I found a villa for us
just where you wanted. It's perfect!

414
00:57:08,435 --> 00:57:11,730
<i>The Flying Saucer is
anchored in the bay below.</i>

415
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:13,899
And Q sent this.

416
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:16,777
Thank you.

417
00:57:23,784 --> 00:57:25,870
- Gotcha!
- Get down!

418
00:57:27,496 --> 00:57:29,582
- Felix!
- Not bad.

419
00:57:29,665 --> 00:57:33,878
Not bad at all. Nothin' wrong with
your reflexes. How you doin', buddy?

420
00:57:33,961 --> 00:57:37,756
- What the hell are you doing here?
- CIA sent me to ride shotgun with you.

421
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,550
- 326.
- How do you do?

422
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:43,471
<i>- Excuse my inexperience. Nicole.
I’m Felix Leiter. Enchanté.</i>

423
00:57:43,554 --> 00:57:46,265
Thank you. My car is right there.

424
00:57:46,891 --> 00:57:49,477
I ran some checks
in the Langley computer.

425
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,563
- Anything on Largo?
- No, he's squeaky-clean.

426
00:57:52,646 --> 00:57:55,691
I must say, for once
your hunch was wrong, buddy.

427
00:57:55,774 --> 00:57:58,360
- Ho-ho! Algernon, right?
- Yes.

428
00:57:58,444 --> 00:58:01,363
I had the first one of those,
and it blew up in my face.

429
00:58:01,447 --> 00:58:04,867
A motorbike came for you
from England. Here's the papers.

430
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:14,794
- What are you gonna do with it?
I’ll know when I test it.

431
00:58:14,877 --> 00:58:17,713
It's gonna be your ass, James.

432
00:58:17,797 --> 00:58:19,882
Thank you(!)

433
00:58:57,962 --> 00:59:00,089
- Felix!
- Yeah?

434
00:59:00,172 --> 00:59:02,258
Forget the soup.

435
00:59:04,426 --> 00:59:07,888
- Feast your eyes on that.
- What've you got here, James?

436
00:59:10,683 --> 00:59:15,312
<i>- (Leiter) That's Largo's lady.
- Her name is Domino. Domino Petachi.</i>

437
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:20,276
Petachi. The air-force officer
killed in that car crash.

438
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:24,572
- Jack Petachi.
- That's right. He was her brother.

439
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:27,491
<i>(Leiter) Well, there's the man himself.</i>

440
00:59:27,575 --> 00:59:30,870
If he's got the bombs, do you think
he'd have them on his yacht?

441
00:59:30,953 --> 00:59:35,332
Unlikely. But get some scuba gear.
We'll check her out.

442
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:38,461
- Right.
- Hmm.

443
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,542
<i>Oui. On a tout ce que vous voulez.</i>

444
01:00:18,626 --> 01:00:21,128
<i>Bon. Au revoir, madame.</i>

445
01:00:23,005 --> 01:00:28,803
<i>Merci. Welcome to the Centre de la Santé.
I hope you enjoy our facilities.</i>

01:00:28,886 --> 01:00:30,971
<i>Merci.</i>

<i>- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

448
01:00:36,018 --> 01:00:39,522
- Do you serve men here?
- But of course.

449
01:00:39,605 --> 01:00:42,191
Some men more than others.

450
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:22,439
<i>Miss Petachi! No one told me
you were here. I am sorry.</i>

451
01:01:23,357 --> 01:01:27,111
- You speak English, yes?
- Yes. Quite well, in fact.

452
01:01:28,154 --> 01:01:31,824
Now... Hard or soft massage?

453
01:01:32,408 --> 01:01:34,493
Oh, hard, please.

454
01:01:35,202 --> 01:01:39,290
Well, perhaps we should
begin with your back.

455
01:01:45,629 --> 01:01:50,426
I... don't believe we've seen
you around here before.

456
01:01:52,887 --> 01:01:55,598
No, I was on a boat.

457
01:01:55,681 --> 01:01:59,143
Ah. And what boat would that be?

458
01:01:59,226 --> 01:02:02,480
<i>- Oh, The Flying Saucer.
- Oh!</i>

459
01:02:02,563 --> 01:02:06,066
- Mr Largo's boat.
- Yes. Do you know Mr Largo?

460
01:02:06,776 --> 01:02:08,861
<i>Oh, I know of him.</i>

461
01:02:09,695 --> 01:02:13,157
I know he owns many beautiful things.

462
01:02:15,618 --> 01:02:18,537
Yes, he's a very generous man, Mr Largo.

463
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:20,873
I'm sure he is.

464
01:02:20,956 --> 01:02:26,128
He's giving a charity ball tonight
at the casino, for children.

465
01:02:26,212 --> 01:02:29,131
- What a worthy cause.
- Mm.

466
01:02:29,215 --> 01:02:31,801
Perhaps I should attend.

467
01:02:31,884 --> 01:02:35,471
I'd really like to ask you. I would.

468
01:02:35,554 --> 01:02:39,975
But I'm afraid the guest list
is very restricted. I'm sorry.

469
01:02:43,062 --> 01:02:45,147
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

470
01:02:45,689 --> 01:02:47,775
<i>C'est la vie?</i>

471
01:02:49,902 --> 01:02:52,113
Such is life.

472
01:02:54,615 --> 01:02:57,201
Such is life.

473
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,253
Mm, that feels so good!

474
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,549
It certainly does.

475
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:14,802
Excuse me?

476
01:03:14,885 --> 01:03:18,097
It certainly does need it. Uh, you have...

477
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,434
...slight lesions in the upper vertebrae.

478
01:03:22,518 --> 01:03:24,395
Oh.

479
01:03:30,109 --> 01:03:32,194
Oh!

480
01:03:32,278 --> 01:03:35,322
Could you go a little lower, please?

481
01:03:35,906 --> 01:03:38,409
- Lower?
- Yes, please.

482
01:03:39,326 --> 01:03:41,412
Please.

483
01:03:42,746 --> 01:03:45,458
Oh! Right there.

484
01:03:51,797 --> 01:03:54,633
<i>Oh, that feels so good!</i>

485
01:03:56,343 --> 01:03:58,220
<i>- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

486
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:02,057
I am sorry, mademoiselle.
We are so very busy today.

487
01:04:03,434 --> 01:04:06,353
- Where'd the masseur go?
- Who?

488
01:04:06,437 --> 01:04:10,816
- The man, the masseur.
- The man I pass? He does not work here.

489
01:04:34,423 --> 01:04:37,301
They'll never let you in.
I'd better wait for you.

490
01:04:37,384 --> 01:04:40,095
<i>(radio) No, Nicole. Go back to the villa.</i>

491
01:04:44,934 --> 01:04:47,853
<i>- Find that villa!
- Oui, mademoiselle.</i>

492
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:04,161
<i>Monsieur? Wait a minute! You there!</i>

493
01:05:04,912 --> 01:05:06,997
<i>(thud)</i>

494
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:17,675
I shouldn't have the fish.

495
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:25,850
You must have an unreasonable fear of
gatecrashers to carry this heavy artillery.

496
01:05:27,685 --> 01:05:31,564
This bomb has a tiny gyroscope inside.

497
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:37,278
Any lateral movement on your part
and you could be served in an egg cup.

498
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:41,740
If you understand what's being
explained to you, nod gently.

499
01:05:43,492 --> 01:05:45,703
Good boy. Stay.

500
01:07:52,997 --> 01:07:57,585
Hello again. I do owe you an explanation.

501
01:07:58,085 --> 01:08:00,921
My name is Bond. James Bond.

502
01:08:02,506 --> 01:08:04,967
May I offer you a drink?

503
01:08:20,775 --> 01:08:23,527
- Hard or soft?
- Soft.

504
01:08:23,611 --> 01:08:27,031
A double Bloody Mary with
plenty of Worcestershire sauce.

505
01:08:27,114 --> 01:08:30,326
I hate to think what you mean
by hard. Vodka on the rocks.

506
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:53,015
I think you have lost her.

507
01:08:53,098 --> 01:08:58,187
<i>Do you imagine that I could lose a woman
to an underpaid British agent? Ja?</i>

508
01:08:58,270 --> 01:09:00,689
<i>Ja. And I warn you...</i>

509
01:09:00,773 --> 01:09:05,194
...if he's not executed at once,
he'll have your Domino turned over.

510
01:09:05,277 --> 01:09:09,865
Is it possible that you have bungled
your attempts because you want him...

511
01:09:10,825 --> 01:09:12,910
...for yourself? Hm?

512
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:20,251
Maximillian, why torture yourself
over that kind of woman?

513
01:09:20,334 --> 01:09:23,254
Maybe one day
you have to kill her, Fatima.

514
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:28,843
Your sense of humour is delicious.

515
01:09:28,926 --> 01:09:31,428
What's your brother up to these days?

516
01:09:31,512 --> 01:09:35,057
He's on his way here.
Oh, I can't wait to see him.

517
01:09:37,059 --> 01:09:39,270
- How do you know my brother?
- Hello!

518
01:09:39,353 --> 01:09:42,106
You must be Mr James Bond, right?

519
01:09:42,773 --> 01:09:45,109
Monsieur Largo.

520
01:09:45,192 --> 01:09:46,444
Yes. Right.

521
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:49,071
Are you a man who enjoys games?

522
01:09:49,572 --> 01:09:52,450
It depends with whom I'm playing.

523
01:09:52,533 --> 01:09:54,660
<i>Ja. Shall we?</i>

524
01:09:54,743 --> 01:09:56,829
Join us.

525
01:09:59,206 --> 01:10:03,294
These are my friends. They honoured me
by coming from all over the world...

526
01:10:03,377 --> 01:10:05,671
...to give money to my favourite charity.

527
01:10:05,754 --> 01:10:08,591
- And what might that be?
- Orphan children.

528
01:10:08,674 --> 01:10:11,802
So... here we are.

529
01:10:12,761 --> 01:10:16,515
The game is called Domination.
I designed it myself.

530
01:10:17,475 --> 01:10:23,355
But my problem is, I've never
yet found a worthy adversary.

531
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:26,358
No doubt I shall disappoint you too.

532
01:10:27,985 --> 01:10:30,070
We'll see.

533
01:10:31,781 --> 01:10:33,866
Darling?

534
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:40,748
This game has one objective: Power.

535
01:10:44,627 --> 01:10:49,089
We will be fighting for countries,
chosen at random by the machine.

536
01:10:49,173 --> 01:10:53,511
But for this demonstration
I will choose France.

537
01:10:53,594 --> 01:10:56,764
Target areas will light up on the map.

538
01:10:56,847 --> 01:11:00,851
Whoever hits them first with
his laser beam will score points.

539
01:11:00,935 --> 01:11:03,270
But there is another way to win.

540
01:11:03,354 --> 01:11:06,816
With the left hand,
you control two nuclear missiles.

541
01:11:06,899 --> 01:11:10,736
With the right hand, you control
a shield to block my missiles.

542
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:14,281
But if you fail... Boom! I win the game.

543
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:17,576
You will be red. I will be blue.

544
01:11:18,953 --> 01:11:21,080
Are you ready?

545
01:11:21,163 --> 01:11:22,748
Yes.

546
01:11:25,793 --> 01:11:27,628
Begin.

547
01:11:27,711 --> 01:11:32,049
<i>Thank you, gentlemen. Eternal battle
for the domination of the world begins.</i>

548
01:11:32,133 --> 01:11:35,970
<i>- We play for dollars.
- Random target selection: Spain.</i>

549
01:11:36,053 --> 01:11:38,139
<i>Value: $9,000.</i>

550
01:11:38,806 --> 01:11:40,683
<i>Play.</i>

551
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:51,110
<i>Blue wins $9,000.</i>

552
01:11:51,193 --> 01:11:54,447
It gave me a shock.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

553
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:58,451
Unlike armchair generals,
we will share the pain of our soldiers...

554
01:11:58,534 --> 01:12:01,203
...in the form of electric shocks.

555
01:12:01,287 --> 01:12:06,876
One last point: If you let go
of the controls, you forfeit the game.

556
01:12:06,959 --> 01:12:11,630
As you were unaware of this,
we will begin again.

557
01:12:13,799 --> 01:12:16,093
<i>Reset. Thank you.</i>

558
01:12:19,305 --> 01:12:23,976
<i>Random target selection: Japan.
Value: $16,000.</i>

559
01:12:25,102 --> 01:12:28,230
<i>- Play.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.</i>

560
01:12:41,827 --> 01:12:44,622
<i>Blue wins $16,000.</i>

561
01:12:44,705 --> 01:12:48,459
A lucky move on my part.
Perhaps I didn't explain.

562
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:52,296
As the stakes increase,
so does the level of pain.

563
01:12:52,379 --> 01:12:55,883
Rather like life. We continue?

564
01:12:59,303 --> 01:13:01,013
Of course.

565
01:13:02,264 --> 01:13:03,891
Good.

566
01:13:05,643 --> 01:13:08,938
<i>Eternal battle for
the domination of the world begins.</i>

567
01:13:09,021 --> 01:13:11,649
<i>Random target selection:
The United States.</i>

568
01:13:11,732 --> 01:13:14,235
<i>Value: $42,000. Play.</i>

569
01:13:34,547 --> 01:13:36,674
<i>Red pain level at 50% .</i>

570
01:13:37,508 --> 01:13:40,469
<i>Danger level. Repeat. Danger level.</i>

571
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,612
<i>60% .</i>

572
01:13:58,696 --> 01:14:00,781
<i>65% .</i>

573
01:14:04,076 --> 01:14:06,162
<i>Red pain level: 80% .</i>

574
01:14:06,996 --> 01:14:09,081
<i>Danger. Danger.</i>

575
01:14:09,832 --> 01:14:11,625
<i>Danger.</i>

576
01:14:12,585 --> 01:14:14,587
Domino.

577
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,881
Excuse me.

578
01:14:30,269 --> 01:14:32,354
Are you all right?

579
01:14:32,938 --> 01:14:35,024
Fine.

580
01:14:36,275 --> 01:14:38,360
You lost $58,000.

581
01:14:39,236 --> 01:14:42,198
It goes, of course, to my charity.

582
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:45,910
I think it's better if we don't continue.

583
01:14:50,456 --> 01:14:53,709
Can we play one more game
for the rest of the world?

584
01:14:57,129 --> 01:14:59,423
Win or lose?

585
01:15:00,424 --> 01:15:03,010
You know what that could mean?

586
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:09,308
Yes.

587
01:15:09,391 --> 01:15:11,477
Good.

588
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,574
- Best of luck.
- You too.

589
01:15:25,658 --> 01:15:28,702
<i>Final game.
Remaining countries of the world.</i>

590
01:15:28,786 --> 01:15:31,288
<i>Value: $325,000.</i>

591
01:15:32,373 --> 01:15:34,458
<i>Play.</i>

592
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:57,731
<i>Blue missile destroyed.
Blue pain level: 50% .</i>

593
01:15:57,815 --> 01:16:00,818
<i>Danger level. Repeat. Danger level.</i>

594
01:16:02,987 --> 01:16:05,739
<i>Second blue missile destroyed.</i>

595
01:16:06,991 --> 01:16:09,368
<i>Blue pain level: 55% . Danger.</i>

596
01:16:09,452 --> 01:16:11,787
<i>- Max!
- 65% .</i>

597
01:16:13,914 --> 01:16:16,208
<i>Blue pain level: 70% .</i>

598
01:16:17,835 --> 01:16:19,795
<i>- Pain level at 80% .
- Max!</i>

599
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:21,922
<i>85% . Danger. Danger.</i>

600
01:16:22,006 --> 01:16:23,966
<i>- Max!
- Danger.</i>

601
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,186
Excuse me.

602
01:16:38,397 --> 01:16:42,026
It seems I underestimated you.

603
01:16:44,361 --> 01:16:48,657
$267,000.

604
01:16:48,741 --> 01:16:51,410
I'll settle for one dance with Domino.

605
01:16:51,494 --> 01:16:53,579
So...

606
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:58,209
Do you lose as gracefully as you win?

607
01:16:58,292 --> 01:17:02,379
I wouldn't know. I've never lost.
- This game has been played...

608
01:17:02,463 --> 01:17:05,132
...and I have lost. That's it.

609
01:17:09,053 --> 01:17:12,681
- He's never gone this far before.
- He's certifiable.

610
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,851
<i>- A tango, yes?
- Oui, monsieur.</i>

611
01:17:21,482 --> 01:17:23,901

What is it you're after?

613
01:17:53,389 --> 01:17:57,309
In part, it's about your brother.
- What about my brother?

614
01:17:59,478 --> 01:18:01,605
Did you know he was working for Largo?

615
01:18:01,689 --> 01:18:04,984
That's impossible.
Jack is in the US air force.

616
01:18:05,067 --> 01:18:07,987
That's precisely why Largo used him.

617
01:18:12,241 --> 01:18:14,326
Your brother's dead.

618
01:18:15,327 --> 01:18:18,873
Keep dancing. Largo is the prime suspect.

619
01:18:20,124 --> 01:18:22,543
Your brother was used and eliminated.

620
01:18:38,434 --> 01:18:41,353
They move well together, don't they?

621
01:18:44,607 --> 01:18:47,109
Today you have another chance.

622
01:18:47,943 --> 01:18:50,446
This time you'd better not fail.

- Oh, it's Domino, really.

627
01:19:31,612 --> 01:19:34,073

I know.

628

I'd love to have you for lunch.

If you are still around tomorrow,
why don't you join us on our boat?

630
01:19:40,621 --> 01:19:43,124
- Tomorrow's not good for me.
- Why?

631
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:47,086
I’m going to pick up Jack.
- That's not possible.

632
01:19:47,169 --> 01:19:50,047
Jack phoned earlier to say
he'd been delayed again.

633
01:19:50,131 --> 01:19:53,050
At least for another week, maybe two.

634
01:19:53,884 --> 01:19:55,970
Bye-bye.

Hello!

01:32:20,589 --> 01:32:23,467
Good morning.
You are a bit early for lunch.

688
01:32:23,551 --> 01:32:27,346
I know. It's rather embarrassing.
- Prepare for departure.

689
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:32,101
- Steward, get some clothes for my guest.
I’m overwhelmed.

690
01:32:32,184 --> 01:32:36,480
I’m invited for lunch and given a cruise.
- Why? You had other plans?

691
01:32:36,564 --> 01:32:40,568
- No, not at all. I'm at your disposal.
- Of course. Cigarette?

692
01:32:40,651 --> 01:32:42,736
No, not today, thank you.

693
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:44,738
So, um...

694
01:32:44,822 --> 01:32:47,324
- A drink?
- A vodka martini?

695
01:32:49,577 --> 01:32:50,619
Of course.

696
01:33:09,138 --> 01:33:12,975
This is my situation room.
From here, the world comes to me.

697

- You could run a small government.
- Oh, no, I could run a large government.

698
01:33:18,856 --> 01:33:21,358
- What's your latest venture?
- Oil.

699
01:33:21,984 --> 01:33:27,823
A new departure, besides which my other
enterprises are of little consequence.

700
01:33:27,907 --> 01:33:32,286
Well, if it's that big, let's hope
it doesn't blow up in your face.

Mr Bond! Excuse me.

702
01:33:34,371 --> 01:33:36,916
I have work to do. Time is money.

716
01:35:45,419 --> 01:35:47,963
He gave it to me.

717
01:35:48,047 --> 01:35:51,342
- He said it was very valuable.
It doesn't look it.

718
01:35:52,968 --> 01:35:55,679

a place called Palmyra.

And the other one?

727

- About time.
- He used emergency code Tango Zebra.

Haven't a clue, sir.

737
01:38:27,331 --> 01:38:30,292
Well, find out about it, will you?

738

773
01:42:53,139 --> 01:42:56,142
You were a very good secret agent.

774
01:42:56,559 --> 01:42:58,644
Really.

775
01:43:00,646 --> 01:43:02,731
Bye.

776
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:24,462
I'm sure this will amuse you.

777
01:43:25,796 --> 01:43:27,882
<i>(tango music)</i>

778
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:38,476
Goodbye, Domino.

779
01:44:12,176 --> 01:44:14,553
<i>(horses approach)</i>

01:44:24,897 --> 01:44:26,982

01:44:52,174 --> 01:44:54,260
<i>(speaks Arabic)</i>

783
01:45:15,656 --> 01:45:17,741
Cover it up.

784
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:29,545
<i>(vulture squawks)</i>

785
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:57,364
Aagh!

786
01:46:31,982 --> 01:46:34,068
<i>(speaks Arabic)</i>

787
01:46:50,042 --> 01:46:52,128
<i>(Domino screams)</i>

788
01:48:11,624 --> 01:48:15,085
- Hold on!
- Whoa! What are you doing?

789
01:48:15,669 --> 01:48:16,712
James!

790
01:48:19,715 --> 01:48:20,758
<i>(Domino screams)</i>

791
01:49:16,814 --> 01:49:21,068
- You're a hard man to keep up with!
- Clear the line to Washington, Felix.

792
01:49:21,152 --> 01:49:23,654
That's where the first bomb is.

793
01:49:44,425 --> 01:49:47,553
It was never like this
when I was in the navy.

794
01:49:48,888 --> 01:49:50,973
<i>(screams)</i>

795
01:49:52,767 --> 01:49:54,852
Here we are.

796
01:50:00,191 --> 01:50:02,276
What's the matter?

797
01:50:04,236 --> 01:50:07,448
You're going back after Largo, aren't you?

798
01:50:07,531 --> 01:50:09,617
Well, I have to.

799
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:17,333
I want him as much as you do.

800
01:50:17,416 --> 01:50:21,045
Probably more.
I can understand you hating him.

801
01:50:27,635 --> 01:50:32,056
Well, maybe... maybe I don't hate him
enough to risk losing you.

802
01:50:34,308 --> 01:50:37,436
But I don't want to risk losing me, either.

803
01:50:41,398 --> 01:50:45,611
<i>(intercom) Commander Bond, the
Washington bomb has been defused.</i>

804
01:50:45,694 --> 01:50:49,240
<i>Now, sir, from London,
your chief wants to speak to you.</i>

805
01:50:49,323 --> 01:50:53,536
<i>This is M. We've cracked the code
for disarming the warheads...</i>

806
01:50:53,619 --> 01:50:57,665
<i>... but we've only got five hours
to find the second bomb.</i>

807
01:50:57,748 --> 01:51:02,920
<i>Now, as you perfectly well know,
I have absolute confidence in you, and l...</i>

808
01:51:03,003 --> 01:51:07,174
<i>- That's what kept me going, sir.
- All right, then, I’ll be brief with you.</i>

809
01:51:07,258 --> 01:51:09,718
<i>I know you've got your hands full.</i>

810
01:51:09,802 --> 01:51:14,014
<i>- Lf you should come through
this fearful ordeal unscathed...</i>

811
01:51:14,098 --> 01:51:17,935
<i>...I'd like to offer you
lunch at my club. Over.</i>

812
01:51:18,978 --> 01:51:22,440
That's a thrilling prospect, sir.

813
01:51:22,523 --> 01:51:25,025
<i>But if I do get through this...</i>

814
01:51:26,485 --> 01:51:28,988
...I may have other plans.

815
01:51:40,833 --> 01:51:43,544
- Steady at 300.
- Steady at 300.

816
01:51:44,628 --> 01:51:46,255
There she is, sir!

817
01:51:46,338 --> 01:51:48,966
- What's she reading?
- Seven fathoms, sir.

818
01:51:49,759 --> 01:51:53,304
No way we can get in there.
The water's too shallow.

819
01:51:54,847 --> 01:51:57,850
Nothing. Nothing moving on board.

820
01:51:59,393 --> 01:52:02,938
AWAC surveillance reports
no sightings on shore.

821
01:52:03,731 --> 01:52:06,525
Now why did Largo anchor here?

822
01:52:09,779 --> 01:52:12,281
Your pendant. Give it to me.

823
01:52:18,496 --> 01:52:20,623
This is "The Tears of Allah".

824
01:52:20,706 --> 01:52:24,877
The story goes that the prophet wept
and his tears made a well.

825
01:52:26,962 --> 01:52:29,173
The contours are the same.

826
01:52:29,256 --> 01:52:32,134
The diamond must mark a place.

827
01:52:32,218 --> 01:52:34,720
That would be about here.

828
01:52:36,138 --> 01:52:38,808
Right where the oilfields begin!

829
01:53:15,010 --> 01:53:18,264
Sir, there is underwater
activity in the area.

830
01:53:18,806 --> 01:53:21,517
Check the area for underwater caves.

831
01:53:41,162 --> 01:53:46,792
Sonar signals do indicate a cavity
below sea level at 015 degrees.

832
01:53:47,793 --> 01:53:50,087
There's an underground river there.

833
01:54:30,544 --> 01:54:35,299
Commander Pederson,
are you equipped with the new XT-7Bs?

834
01:54:35,382 --> 01:54:38,719
That's top secret.
How do you know about them?

835
01:54:40,221 --> 01:54:44,100
From a Russian translation
of one of your service manuals.

836
01:54:44,183 --> 01:54:46,477
Sorry about that.

837
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:51,732
<i>Ports open.</i>

838
01:54:51,816 --> 01:54:53,818
<i>Fire one!</i>

839
01:54:53,901 --> 01:54:55,611
<i>Fire two!</i>

840
01:54:55,694 --> 01:54:57,780
<i>Cut track.</i>

841
01:57:02,196 --> 01:57:04,573
Be careful of the housing.

842
01:57:23,467 --> 01:57:25,553
Watch it!

843
01:58:02,506 --> 01:58:05,050
<i>(Bond) I've got to go in.</i>

844
01:58:05,134 --> 01:58:07,219
<i>(Leiter) We don't have much time.</i>

845
01:58:07,303 --> 01:58:10,973
Give the sub our position
and get some help.

846
01:59:09,365 --> 01:59:11,867
Kovacs? Kovacs? Come.

847
01:59:13,285 --> 01:59:15,371
Here, look.

848
01:59:16,622 --> 01:59:18,666
<i>(Blofeld) Well done, Dr Kovacs.</i>

849
01:59:18,749 --> 01:59:20,835
<i>Go ahead. Go ahead.</i>

850
01:59:22,294 --> 01:59:26,465
When the warhead is ready for
its final voyage, we will drink a toast.

851
01:59:26,549 --> 01:59:29,009
There is nothing
that can stop us any more.

852
01:59:48,112 --> 01:59:50,197
The guide rope! Keep the tension!

853
02:00:14,638 --> 02:00:16,724
The Tears of Allah.

854
02:00:21,771 --> 02:00:24,064
Sweet, like money.

855
02:00:24,690 --> 02:00:27,109
For years, it has been
a monument to power...

856
02:00:27,193 --> 02:00:30,529
...but nothing like what we
now possess. Huh, Kovacs?

857
02:00:56,555 --> 02:00:59,391
Everybody stay undercover!
You, get up there!

858
02:01:36,595 --> 02:01:38,681
Leiter, stay down!

859
02:01:42,518 --> 02:01:46,647
What took you so long? Hold up on
the heavy stuff. Bond is still in there!

860
02:02:20,931 --> 02:02:22,683
It's armed.

861
02:03:57,194 --> 02:03:59,363
Largo got away with the warhead.

862
02:03:59,447 --> 02:04:03,659
Call down a chopper.
I'm going to try the oasis. Good luck.

863
02:04:03,742 --> 02:04:06,912
Bond's clear! We're movin' in!

864
02:08:30,885 --> 02:08:33,512
Ah! There you are.

865
02:08:33,596 --> 02:08:36,098
I always have a martini at five.

866
02:08:36,682 --> 02:08:39,226
You'll never give up
your old habits, James.

867
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:43,105
No, you're wrong. Those days are over.

868
02:08:43,189 --> 02:08:45,524
Ah!

869
02:09:23,395 --> 02:09:24,396
Oh, no.

870
02:09:25,397 --> 02:09:28,859
I'm sorry, Mr Bond.
Obviously caught you at a bad moment.

871
02:09:28,943 --> 02:09:32,780
- M sent you.
- Only to plead for your return, sir.

872
02:09:32,988 --> 02:09:35,074
M says without you in the service...

873
02:09:35,157 --> 02:09:38,369
...he fears for the security
of the civilised world.

874
02:09:38,452 --> 02:09:41,288
- Never again.
- Never?

875
02:09:41,372 --> 02:09:45,042
<i>~ Never, never say never again</i>

876
02:09:45,126 --> 02:09:48,629

<i>~ But from all that I hear</i>

884
02:10:34,383 --> 02:10:37,261
<i>~ Forget about long-range plans</i>

885
02:10:37,344 --> 02:10:41,432
<i>~ Cos this man's got his own</i>

886

<i>~ To get mixed up with
a man who says never</i>
