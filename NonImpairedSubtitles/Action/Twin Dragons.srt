Yes, sir.

00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:11,008
We'll have to keep these boys separate.
I can't tell which is which.

You shouldn't say that, honey,
besides we never want them to be apart.

Now, do we.

She's your babe?

What do you think?
She looks like Maradonna, doesn't she?

Maradonna plays soccer.
You mean Madonna, don't you?

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,252
Break my left leg.
I'm gonna need my right one.

168
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,413
Yeah?

169
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,730
That's right, tough guy.

170
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,821
I could beat your ass
any day of the week.

171
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,004
You want to end up like Koo, with his
guts spilled all over the sidewalk?

172
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,429
Koo was a loser anyway..

173
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,400
On the Prince Edward Road Circuit, he
couldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole.

174
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:50,992
What do you know about racing?

175
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:53,634
My name's Boomer, and I'm the
best damn driver in Hong Kong.

176
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:55,963
You wanna bet on that?
For 3,000, you're on.

177
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:57,888
Three hundred thousand.

178
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,596
Well, those are
pretty small potatoes.

179
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:02,960
Three hundred thousand?

180
00:14:02,962 --> 00:14:03,714
(CACKLING)

181
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:05,713
Get your car together and
meet us tomorrow.

182
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:09,012
At Ferry Pier.
Three o'clock.

183
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:13,002
I'll be a little richer, and
you'll have another day to live.

184
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:15,806
(ENGINE CHOKING)
Come on, start, you son of a bitch!

185
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,316
How can you race that guy?
You can't even start your car.

186
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:25,754
(KNOCKING ON CAR)
Who's that?

187
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,864
You aren't leaving me, are you?

188
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,012
Uh, hi.

189
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,238
Please get in.
Thanks.

190
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,967
I appreciate all your help.

191
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,169
I just started working here last week.

192
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,407
That gangster's been
bugging me every night.

193
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,813
If you didn't show up,

194
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,742
I would have been in trouble.

195
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,350
What's your name?

196
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,545
Boomer.

197
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,989
Oh, I see.

198
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:52,649
And you?

199
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,221
Tyson.

200
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:55,144
Ah.

201
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:57,896
You don't know who he is?

202
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,691
Not really.

203
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,633
You told me
she was your girl.

204
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:03,838
Uh, well, she is sort of.
I'm working on it.

205
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,564
How dare you?
That's it.

206
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,458
I'm getting out of here.

207
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:15,217
Wait.
Leave me alone.

208
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,448
Boomer!
Boomer!

209
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:18,496
We've been friends forever.

210
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:19,885
You can't let a little thing
like this come between us.

211
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,776
Look, we've been
to hell and back together,

212
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,086
but you have to get a grip
on reality.

213
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,953
How could she be interested in you?

214
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:29,854
You two have nothing in common.
Look at her hair.

215
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,759
I don't know..

216
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:33,924
I think I got a shot. Don't you?

217
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:37,498
(GROANS)
You're driving me crazy!

218
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,628
(SNORTS)

219
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:48,710
I didn't like that job anyway.

220
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:53,986
Uh, what's your name again?

221
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,178
Barbara.

222
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,988
Uh, Barbara, that's right.

223
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:59,590
Do you think you can
tell the big hero over there..

224
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,791
If you might be
interested in him?

225
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,942
Just between us,
you see...

226
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:19,996
he's never had a girlfriend.

227
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:22,279
It was nice meeting you.

228
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,211
You have a good time.
I'm going home now.

229
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:29,988
I'm sorry, Boomer.

230
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:57,975
Excuse me Mister Ma, is this
your first visit to Hong Kong?

231
00:16:58,153 --> 00:16:59,051
Yes.

232
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:01,086
Well, we certainly look forward
to your concert, sir.

233
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:07,976
Three hundred thousand.

234
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,657
This is the last time.
Come on, I need a car.

235
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,695
Look, last time
you were three hours late.

236
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,140
You sure didn't complain
when I gave you $400.

237
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:19,032
Are you backing down on our deal?

238
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,932
You scratched the last one up.
They almost found me out.

239
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:23,837
That's $600 you owe me.

240
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,966
Hmm.
Hey!

241
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:27,470
Careful.
They might be watching us now.

242
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:30,399
This is the last time.
I never wanna see you guys again.

243
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:32,444
Step on it!

244
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:33,884
Yeah!

245
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:37,743
I'll be back in a second.

246
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:39,843
Hey, wait up. Where the
hell you think you're going?

247
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:40,941
I gotta take a leak.

248
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:41,998
Hurry back.

249
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:44,840
Whoa, whoa!

250
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,890
Hey, you think
you own the damn road?

251
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,115
Pardon me.

252
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,782
Here we are, Maestro.
Uh-huh.

253
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:55,327
Oh, bellman!

254
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:56,402
Heh, heh.

255
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:01,136
You out did yourself.
Nice choice too.

256
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:02,597
My favorite color.

257
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:06,099
You are <i>the</i> man.

258
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,539
Let's take a ride. Get in!

259
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:09,992
(LAUGHING)
Hey!

260
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:15,167
Sorry, kid, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

261
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:16,380
Quit fooling around, huh?

262
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:20,780
Hey, Tyson.
What are you doing down there?

263
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:23,349
Huh?
You and your stupid jokes. Take that!

264
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,315
It's not funny!

265
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:25,784
Hey!
Rolling me on the ground like that!

266
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:29,852
Hey!

267
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:31,254
I'm so sorry.

268
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:39,961
<i>Good morning, sir.
Welcome.</i>

269
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:40,430
Yes.

270
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:41,731
This way...

271
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,258
Not 100...
400,000 shares.

272
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,457
Ah, there you are, John!
(CHUCKLING) I remember you!

273
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:53,494
Still well?

274
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:55,725
I'm good. We haven't seen
each other in a long time.

275
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,267
Oh, come on over here.
Look. Do you recognize her?

276
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:02,139
She's the same girl you used
to play with, when you were a kid.

277
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,038
Tammy, go on and say " hello " to John.
Go on!

278
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:09,902
Oh, come on, a nice, big kiss.
That's better.

279
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:11,902
She finished her training
as a nurse.

280
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,984
When she heard you were coming, she
quit her job, just to take care of you.

281
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:16,383
That's nice,
but I feel fine.

282
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:20,191
Now, John, there are a lot of diseases
in this part of the world.

283
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:25,216
You're a world famous conductor. You
really can't afford to catch anything.

284
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:26,921
It would be terrible, if you did.

285
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:28,463
Please, I would like
to freshen up first.

286
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:31,863
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
We'll talk later, huh?

287
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,996
Oh, Tammy, will you show
some interest?

288
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,438
Daddy, I already have a boyfriend.

289
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,508
I'm helping you get a husband,
not a boyfriend.

290
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,702
What about Rocky?

291
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,903
Who? Stallone?

292
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:44,380
Not Stallone. Frankie Lok.
I call him Rocky.

293
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,908
Even Rocky would tell you to go for it.
Now, take this medicine bag.

294
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,019
Your daddy's very serious about this.

295
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,314
I want you and John to hit it off.

296
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,450
We'll have a merger with the Ma family,
and both our businesses will prosper.

297
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,394
And we'll be one big, happy corporation...
I mean, family.

298
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:01,490
It's a very tough business world
we live in, my dear..

299
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,593
John, are you there?
My daughter's here to see you.

300
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,675
Now, you remember. Be nice to him.
Daddy, daddy.

301
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,588
Go on, get in there.
(SHOUTING)

302
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:13,147
Oh, God, I hope it works.

303
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,662
Here, let me help you with this.

304
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:21,541
So many bottles.
I thought your father was kidding.

305
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,210
I didn't know nurses were so sexy
these days. You're showing.

306
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:27,846
No, up here.
Oh!

307
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:31,125
Even when I was a child,
I hardly needed vitamins or medicine.

308
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,130
If I had known, I wouldn't
have brought so many.

309
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,459
Come on, sit over here.

310
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:37,998
Thank you.

311
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:44,303
Your dress is a bit tight.
Must restrict the circulation.

312
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,200
And your posture's not too good.

313
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:49,275
That's probably why you often
get a sore back. Am I right?

314
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:52,105
How'd you know that?
Hmm, come with me.

315
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,349
Lie down, please.
So soon?

316
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,112
Oh. Oh!

317
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,716
Don't worry. No need to rush.
We'll go slowly.

318
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:05,183
Oh!

319
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:06,840
Ooh!

320
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,090
Put your leg up here.
Just relax.

321
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:12,580
(CRACKING)
(SCREAMING)

322
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:13,797
I'm almost done.

323
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,496
Wouldn't it be easier
with my clothes off?

Tyson was always nice to you.
Why don't you go to see him?

483
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:38,596
He's in a lot of pain,
and you can make his day.

484
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,606
Well, I don't want him
to get the wrong idea.

485
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:44,936
You can see him as a friend
and settle the rest later.

486
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:46,377
I don't think I can do that.

487
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,804
Sounds very serious.

488
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:51,241
If you need anything else...

489
00:30:51,381 --> 00:30:53,872
No?

490
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:57,006
(HUMMING)

491
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,848
Two, please.
Yes, of course. Right this way.

492
00:31:06,053 --> 00:31:09,147
I don't want to go to the hospital.
Let's just have lunch, okay?

493
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,985
WAITER:
Uh, I take care of it for you.

494
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,619
(CLEARS THROAT)
Excuse me. Sir, sir?

495
00:31:13,628 --> 00:31:15,562
Would you mind
not leaning on the glass?

496
00:31:15,564 --> 00:31:18,018
You might disturb
the gentleman on the other side.

497
00:31:20,863 --> 00:31:22,110
Excuse me sir,
I've instructed the gentleman...

498
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,763
on the other side not to disturb you.

499
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,392
WAITER:
Hmm?

500
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:31,665
It's very sweet, you know,
Tyson having a crush on me.

501
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:34,304
But I'm not gonna be his girlfriend.

502
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:35,960
People change. Come on.

503
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:40,379
Who was that huge guy back there?
My... my boyfriend.

504
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:45,780
Looks more like a gorilla.
I work with him at the health club.

505
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:47,466
Wait a minute.
I thought you were a nurse.

506
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:49,703
Look, if you promise to tell him,
then we can stop by.

507
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:52,642
Sounds fair enough.
Waiter. Check, please.

508
00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:54,986
Okay. Coming.

509
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:57,814
BARBARA: <i>So that's it.
Let's get out of her.</i>

510
00:31:58,018 --> 00:31:59,916
I'd like to go back soon.
I have a rehearsal.

511
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,019
I hope it's all right.
Your check, sir.

512
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:06,147
Is it a policy?
We haven't ordered yet.

513
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:10,682
Oh, sorry.
So...

514
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,051
<i>Get out of my way!</i>

515
00:32:12,956 --> 00:32:13,651
He's not a bad guy.

516
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:14,985
Here he comes now.

517
00:32:16,295 --> 00:32:17,387
Oh! You better hide.

518
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:20,196
(HUMMING)

519
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:21,303
Tammy!

520
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,214
(GROANING)

521
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:27,774
Move!
Hey!

522
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:29,953
What are you doing?
Just get out. Run!

523
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:32,922
You scum!

524
00:32:36,124 --> 00:32:38,523
Hey, hey! Hold it right there.
You hear me?

525
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,659
Nobody messes around with my girl.
Get back here, you son of a bitch.

526
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:43,553
Rocky, wait!
Come back here.

527
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,432
Hey!

528
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:47,385
Stop it!
Hey!

529
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:48,366
Stand back.

530
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:50,359
Tammy, I'm gonna show you
what a real man is.

531
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:52,575
You better run,
or he's gonna kill you.

532
00:32:55,244 --> 00:32:57,235
Now, Tammy!
You look great.

533
00:32:57,647 --> 00:32:59,137
Be right back.

534
00:33:01,608 --> 00:33:02,724
Wait!

535
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:07,111
What's going on?

536
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:10,085
Why are you defending me?
I don't even know you.

537
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,290
Tammy!

538
00:33:14,704 --> 00:33:16,872
You better run. I'll hold him for you.
What?

539
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:18,466
Go on! Run!
What?

540
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:20,554
You are really hurting
my pride now, Miss.

541
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,108
(GROANING)

542
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,075
You forgot your change, Mister.

543
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:40,046
I don't want it.
Thank you, sir.

544
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,224
Here, you hold her.

545
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:44,994
Haven't you had enough yet?

546
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:50,998
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

547
00:33:52,024 --> 00:33:54,318
Wait. I don't even know you.

548
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:56,619
So what? I don't care.

549
00:33:57,696 --> 00:33:59,594
Excuse me.

550
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,589
Hey.

551
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:09,533
Why are you in such a hurry?
You didn't pay the bill?

552
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,571
No, I did not.

553
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:13,539
Hey, where'd you get that jacket?
Did you steal it?

554
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:14,905
What are you talking about?
Cut it out.

555
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:18,914
Wow!
That's a great car.

556
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:21,643
Cool!
Whose is it?

557
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:26,018
I can't believe it.
Does it belong to a lawyer?

558
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,351
Can I drop you somewhere?

559
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:30,392
What a car!
Real leather.

560
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:34,893
Stop fighting...

561
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,265
Excuse me!

562
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,434
Come on now.
You shouldn't do this.

563
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:46,065
Why don't you tell him that.

564
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:48,432
Aghhh!

565
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:52,272
Wait, I really have no idea
who you are.

566
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:53,405
Ahh.

567
00:34:58,956 --> 00:34:59,752
Aghh!

568
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:02,851
Now, you're going to get it!

569
00:35:07,832 --> 00:35:09,026
You shouldn't do this!

570
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,563
We'll finish this.

571
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,998
Huh?

572
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,970
No harm, no pain.

573
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:23,008
Ohh...

574
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,670
Don't you ever try to
come across me again.

575
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:25,874
Who want this now, huh?

576
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:29,579
You cause trouble everywhere.

577
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:38,627
Hey, I'm warning you.
You'd better stop. Come on.

578
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,002
Oh.

579
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:42,912
Oh.

580
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,962
Ohh!

581
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,560
I don't want to
hurt you any more.

582
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:49,905
Will you stop it!

583
00:35:50,074 --> 00:35:51,974
My stuff is all broke.
Someone's got to pay.

584
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:53,175
Come on.

585
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:03,084
Look, you'd better pay this.
Right now.

586
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:13,090
That guy's crazy.

587
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:16,794
I never knew you were so strong.
Miss, what are you doing?

588
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:19,425
I really like what I
found out about you.

589
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:21,723
Well, alright.

590
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:24,037
What do you want from me?

591
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,400
Don't treat me like that.

592
00:36:26,944 --> 00:36:29,941
Well, whatever you say.

593
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,002
Hmm...

594
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:32,814
Please, tell me your name?

595
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:36,885
Boomer. Will you stop
fooling around, punk!

596
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:40,580
My name's, John Ma,
not Boomer.

597
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:42,123
So, where can I drop you off?

598
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:43,885
At the hospital.

599
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:46,286
Why? Are you sick?

600
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,421
You asked me to go see Tyson.

601
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:49,796
Oh, really?

602
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:51,965
Bad acting talent.
You're not an actor.

603
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,929
I know, I've played piano
since I was eight.

604
00:36:54,932 --> 00:36:57,888
The Royal Music Conservatory
at age twelve.

605
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,839
At twenty, I won the
Beethoven Conductor Award.

606
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:03,606
Like you have lots of money?

607
00:37:04,008 --> 00:37:06,002
Well...?

608
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,480
Oh course, you went to school
and studied over-seas then?

609
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:11,578
How did you know?
Oh, of course!

610
00:37:12,808 --> 00:37:14,002
Oh...

611
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:17,544
Wow. This place!

612
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,938
You made me feel so good the other day.
Would you mind doing it again?

613
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,564
I don't know what
you're talking about, lady.

614
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:25,974
I'm just a mechanic.

615
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:27,466
I'll go lie down and wait.

616
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:35,884
This joke's gone further
than I thought.

617
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,153
I might just have to go for it.

618
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:41,453
I'll fix her motor.

619
00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:46,112
Wow, what a place.
This is great.

620
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:53,334
Hey, you know that's
very good, Beethoven?

621
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,098
Beethoven.

622
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,446
Stop!
What is it?

623
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,451
Continue!

624
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,904
Stop!

625
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,260
I'm sorry, go on.
OK!

626
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:57,224
Ugh.

627
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,894
Your turn.
Try it!

628
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:01,908
You want me...?

629
00:39:04,112 --> 00:39:05,908
No.. I can't!

630
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:07,370
Sit down!

631
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:30,378
I can't wait any longer!
Hurry up! Huh?

632
00:39:30,753 --> 00:39:33,050
(SNORTS)
Alright!

633
00:39:40,365 --> 00:39:42,363
Huh... huh? Ahhh!
YAieee!

634
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:47,924
Huh... ohh.

635
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:57,133
Hmph... mmm?

636
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,876
I didn't know you drank

637
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,992
and smoked.

638
00:40:15,008 --> 00:40:18,336
Always after a work-out.

639
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,004
A workout, that's all it was?

640
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,231
Hey, you're the one
who asked me up here.

641
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:24,740
That was very different
than the last time.

642
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:26,637
You mean, we've done this before?

643
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:30,008
Stop it.
What do you think I am?

644
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:31,147
I didn't think anything,
so what's the matter?

645
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:33,749
Huh?

646
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:34,818
Nothing?

647
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:36,618
Aren't you going to get that?

648
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,653
Oh. I got to go.

649
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:41,418
What concert are you talking about?

650
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:42,758
The one I'll be conducting.

651
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:44,830
Alright. No more jokes, ok?

652
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:49,196
Boomer, I thought I told you,
I never wanted to see you in here again.

653
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:52,902
Mister, you are really impolite.
You are Mister... uh?

654
00:40:52,904 --> 00:40:54,096
Security!
Come on, let's get...

655
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:55,435
We have a problem.

656
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:58,032
What seems to be the problem?

657
00:40:58,044 --> 00:41:00,000
I know this man,
he's always trouble around here.

658
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,477
Mr. Ma?!
Yes!

659
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,378
There must be
some kind of mistake.

660
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,949
Mr. Ma, is
the world famous Conductor.

661
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:07,349
You should apologize?

662
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:08,818
Sorry!

663
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:10,186
Let's get back to work.
Yes, sir!

664
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,551
Mr. Ma, it's an honor!

665
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,751
Thank you for your help.
Don't bother our guests.

666
00:41:17,004 --> 00:41:18,758
I am sorry!
I have to go back to my room.

667
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,965
By the way, your concert
has been filled to capacity.

668
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:23,434
That's right, I almost forgot.
Thank you.

669
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:26,969
If you need anything special,
please, don't forget to ask.

670
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,235
Welcome, Miss!

671
00:41:30,744 --> 00:41:32,234
Why do they all know you?

672
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:33,471
I really need some good help.

673
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:36,913
These clothes are ridiculous.

674
00:41:36,915 --> 00:41:37,810
Let's get one thing straight,

675
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:39,117
I don't have to be your slave,
just because I slept with you.

676
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,011
What are you talking about?

677
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:42,743
Give me a kiss.

678
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:44,313
Stay still will you, there are people
waiting for you to perform.

679
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:46,221
Perform?
Now, we gotta do it in public?

680
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:48,123
Hey, be careful!

681
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:50,957
Let's go, come on, hurry, hurry...
Where are we going?

682
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,294
So, how much did you pay him
to get him to put on that show?

683
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:57,902
My room here costs four hundred a day.

684
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,369
Four hundred?
Yes, U.S. dollars.

685
00:42:03,004 --> 00:42:06,344
You look like a Conductor.
What do you mean look like?

686
00:42:06,346 --> 00:42:08,652
I really am a Conductor.
I wasn't kidding, you know.

687
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:11,008
I know you're teasing me,
but I love that.

688
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,220
I don't know why I let her push me around.
How did I get myself into this mess?

689
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:20,324
Anyways, she is pretty.

690
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:25,544
Not again.

691
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:45,000
Ahh!
Ahh!

692
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:46,552
Ghost!
You look just like me.

693
00:42:46,554 --> 00:42:49,212
We're even dressed the same.

694
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,886
Weird.

695
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,004
I don't know about you,
but I think I am going crazy.

696
00:42:57,006 --> 00:42:59,784
Wow!
It's strange isn't it?

697
00:43:00,004 --> 00:43:02,766
Hey, imagine.
I could be taken for you.

698
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,000
Ah.

699
00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:07,112
No wonder the girl out there
thinks I am a musician.

700
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:09,006
She certainly thinks I'm you.
(SNORTS)

701
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,364
Ah.

702
00:43:10,366 --> 00:43:13,000
That's why the girl doesn't believe
I'm giving a concert.

703
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,100
Ah.

704
00:43:14,204 --> 00:43:16,112
You play in a band.

705
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:17,586
A band?
Never mind.

706
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:19,224
Well, whatever you gotta do.

707
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:21,002
What do you mean?
You're wearing my clothes.

708
00:43:21,004 --> 00:43:23,108
You have to give them
back to me and fix things up.

709
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:26,540
Ok, but don't tell the girl
I'm with, alright?

710
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,084
Wait, do you know a Barbara?

711
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:31,022
What? You mean you know her?

712
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:32,204
I'm pretty sure, that's her name.

713
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:34,680
She got into my car and asked me
to take her to the hospital.

714
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:36,872
To see this guy, Tyson.

715
00:43:37,588 --> 00:43:39,770
It's getting awfully confusing.

716
00:43:40,002 --> 00:43:41,010
Aaa... choo!

717
00:43:41,388 --> 00:43:42,440
Aah... choo!

718
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,004
How come when I sneeze, you sneeze?

719
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:50,318
That's right!

720
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:52,480
Were you on a boat lately?

721
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:53,421
You're right!

722
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,786
Oh. My God!

723
00:43:54,788 --> 00:43:56,859
No wonder I was sea-sick.

724
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,790
What do you do when I get laid?

725
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:00,253
You mean with a girl?

726
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:02,195
Of course, what else would I mean?

727
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,780
Ho... Ho... Ho... Ho... Ho!

728
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:06,201
Hope he's not too kinky.

729
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:08,012
Oh, wait! Wait!

730
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:10,112
Hey, you'd better get
your hand off me.

731
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,811
You're forgetting your phone.

732
00:44:12,814 --> 00:44:14,903
Thanks a lot!

733
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,712
Ah... Maestro!
Right on schedule!

734
00:44:25,188 --> 00:44:26,486
Hey!

735
00:44:26,504 --> 00:44:28,384
Are you ready?
Barbara?

736
00:44:28,396 --> 00:44:29,596
What are you doing here?
Are you serious?

737
00:44:29,731 --> 00:44:31,632
Is there something wrong with me?

738
00:44:33,702 --> 00:44:34,602
What's going on here?

739
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:35,902
Why do I have to remind
you of every little detail?

740
00:44:36,704 --> 00:44:38,002
Just a second.

741
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,234
Hello.

742
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:43,491
<i>Who is this </i>?
Who is this?

743
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:45,732
<i>Better get your ass down here.
We've been looking for you.</i>

744
00:44:45,734 --> 00:44:48,297
Oh no, I'm no Boomer.
You've got the wrong number.

745
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:51,268
Huh?
This phone isn't mine.

746
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,662
They got switched around.

747
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,240
You just wait right here!

748
00:44:57,242 --> 00:44:58,402
Wait!

749
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:00,681
Ya, Boomer?

750
00:45:01,224 --> 00:45:02,310
<i>Where are you </i>?

751
00:45:02,312 --> 00:45:04,315
I'm in the lobby with Barbara,
just tell me where you are?

752
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,554
I'm in the car with Tammy.

753
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:07,457
Get in here. I have to protect her.
And make it fast.

754
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:10,765
You gotta take her with you,
it's getting too dangerous.

755
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,798
But, I can't go inside.

756
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,593
I need your help to
explain something to her.

757
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:14,862
I understand.

758
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:16,768
I've got more than
I can handle, right now.

759
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,902
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
What?

760
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,404
What?

761
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:21,671
John, John? Hello?
Damn it the battery is dead.

762
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:25,837
Wait a second,
I need to change the phone.

763
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,211
Wait, please! We're going to be late.

764
00:45:28,213 --> 00:45:29,850
I'll be right back.

765
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:30,838
You stay right here. Don't go away.

766
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,950
I'll be right back. Ok?
Where are you going?

767
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:44,766
Ah... Maestro!
This way!

768
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:47,861
That was quick.
Please, get in!

769
00:45:48,304 --> 00:45:49,896
Get in! Please!

770
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:51,012
Thank you, sir.

771
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:55,467
I was really getting worried.
We're going to be late.

772
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:57,603
Driver, let's go!
Alright!

773
00:45:58,014 --> 00:45:59,003
Where are we going?

774
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:01,246
To the concert.

775
00:46:04,354 --> 00:46:07,845
Is that Boomer I just saw leaving
right now, in that big car?

776
00:46:08,323 --> 00:46:09,722
Yeah, that was him alright.

777
00:46:12,362 --> 00:46:13,556
Then, who in the heck's that?

778
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:20,430
Oh, Hi.
I thought, I just saw you leave?

779
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,671
Barbara, I'm glad you're here.
I have to talk with you.

780
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,330
Don't touch me.

781
00:46:25,475 --> 00:46:26,669
Does that mean you don't know us?

782
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,304
Have we met before?

783
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,504
We're holding your little friend,
so don't mess around?

784
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:31,545
I'm not sure I understand.

785
00:46:31,714 --> 00:46:33,511
We're talking about Tyson.

786
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,047
Don't you think you can
tell me where I'm going.

787
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,880
To save someone for us.

788
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:46,584
Sounds interesting.
Who's the lucky guy?

789
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:49,282
Cops got our boss.
He's in that truck right there.

790
00:46:49,522 --> 00:46:52,514
No way, chase a policeman.
I'm not a race car driver.

791
00:46:52,658 --> 00:46:55,650
I heard you were the best.
Now, is the time to prove it.

792
00:46:55,728 --> 00:46:58,322
If you fail, Barbara and
Tyson are history.

793
00:46:58,464 --> 00:47:00,061
Don't get up tight!

794
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:03,264
I'm not scared. You're the one
who needs to relax.

795
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,594
Oh, no! Too many people!
I'm getting out here!

796
00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:08,805
Why are you scared?

797
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:09,772
Stop fooling around.

798
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:14,611
Show me you're the famous John Ma.

799
00:47:14,615 --> 00:47:16,809
But, I'm not Maestro Ma.
I'm Boomer.

800
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:19,977
Now get out there!

801
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:22,482
Stop it!
I hate making jokes with my future.

802
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,660
You've worked so hard,
all your life, for this night.

803
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:31,588
Now, you get out there!
Show some guts!

804
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:35,265
Fine, I'll go out there,
but you'll be sorry.

805
00:47:42,706 --> 00:47:44,196
Hey, where are you going?

806
00:47:44,977 --> 00:47:46,376
Wait!
So many people out there.

807
00:47:46,846 --> 00:47:48,939
You're baton.
What's that?

808
00:47:49,282 --> 00:47:51,078
Just wave it around.
You'll be alright.

809
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:52,205
(SNORTS)

810
00:47:52,384 --> 00:47:53,874
Here goes nothing.

811
00:48:02,364 --> 00:48:04,558
Alright, let's move it!

812
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,712
Withdraw! Pull back!

813
00:48:25,688 --> 00:48:27,485
We'll get you out of here, boss.

814
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:08,711
Slow down!

815
00:49:13,971 --> 00:49:15,268
You wait for me
here and stay cool.

816
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:17,236
Move it!

817
00:49:17,238 --> 00:49:18,502
What? What?
What's wrong with this door? Damn it!

818
00:49:18,676 --> 00:49:21,076
Unlock the door!
Thanks a lot.

819
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:47,466
What? Are you sure you don't
have a reservation tonight after 9:00?

820
00:49:47,604 --> 00:49:50,299
Because, I specifically remember
calling back on Tuesday the...

821
00:49:50,406 --> 00:49:53,101
Ah!... Oh!

822
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:54,637
Hurry up will ya!

823
00:49:58,417 --> 00:50:00,907
Tuesday, no, you don't
understand my position...

824
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:03,210
Sorry, my turn. Go away!

825
00:50:10,286 --> 00:50:12,083
Hello?

826
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:13,428
Is that you John?

827
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:15,292
Hey, Boomer! I need your help
to get me out of here!

828
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:18,367
I need you here!
You don't understand!

829
00:50:18,536 --> 00:50:20,731
They put me on stage. I'm
conducting your concert.

830
00:50:20,805 --> 00:50:22,602
It's all turning into a disaster.

831
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,938
Just wave your hands
around, alright?

832
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:25,236
What's happening to you?

833
00:50:25,444 --> 00:50:28,140
Get outside! Now!

834
00:50:30,442 --> 00:50:32,008
Phone dead.

835
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,180
Just wave my hands around.

836
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:13,610
It's my concert.

837
00:51:13,688 --> 00:51:15,782
Do I know who this guy is?

838
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,431
This is our big, big boss.

839
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:18,802
You're Big Big Boss?
Uh... huh.

840
00:51:19,078 --> 00:51:22,376
Ok, hot shot, I want to go!

841
00:51:22,527 --> 00:51:23,620
Come on!

842
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,630
That's it! That's it!
Stronger! Stronger!

843
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,903
More feeling?

844
00:51:39,906 --> 00:51:43,224
Shut the hell up and drive!

845
00:51:50,049 --> 00:51:52,641
Hey, come on!
Quit foolin' around!

846
00:51:55,718 --> 00:51:56,618
Come on! Let's go!

847
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:00,362
I'm sorry!
Watch out for the car!

848
00:52:49,303 --> 00:52:51,201
Are you alright? Boss!

849
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:52,498
I'll go first!

850
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,740
Start driving or I will kill you.
Get going!

851
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:10,211
Hey, is that them?

852
00:53:13,259 --> 00:53:14,250
Step on the brake, step on it...

853
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:16,226
Here. You do it!

854
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,227
It's all yours!

855
00:53:17,363 --> 00:53:19,557
Hey, you guys!

856
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,625
Now, we're on fire!

857
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:36,681
Pull the hand-brake!

858
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:39,216
Here, why don't
you do it, yourself.

859
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,908
Thank you. Thank you.

860
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,012
Out of my way!

861
00:54:02,382 --> 00:54:04,576
Boss! We're coming!

862
00:54:13,004 --> 00:54:14,212
Bravo!

863
00:54:26,301 --> 00:54:28,099
Welcome, Mr. Ma!

864
00:54:28,872 --> 00:54:32,067
You could use a little freshening up
before the reception.

865
00:54:33,274 --> 00:54:35,265
We'll all be waiting in the
VIP room, for your arrival.

866
00:54:36,479 --> 00:54:38,971
Mr. Ma's back!

867
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,549
Hello, my Dear.

868
00:54:42,651 --> 00:54:45,846
Hi, is the VIP Room ready yet
for the reception?

869
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,818
Certainly it is ready... but?

870
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:49,354
Wait a second.

871
00:54:49,393 --> 00:54:51,485
May I ask who you are?

872
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,649
I'm John Ma.

873
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,020
But, who is the man who
went to your room?

874
00:54:56,899 --> 00:54:59,093
Um...
Did he come back?

875
00:55:00,835 --> 00:55:02,826
I really think, we should
hurry up, for the press conference.

876
00:55:02,871 --> 00:55:04,168
I have to take a shower.
I'll be right back.

877
00:55:04,473 --> 00:55:05,667
John?!

878
00:55:07,002 --> 00:55:08,114
Thank you.

879
00:55:10,345 --> 00:55:11,243
Get in here, hurry..

880
00:55:14,216 --> 00:55:16,413
You can't believe,
what just happened to me.

881
00:55:16,488 --> 00:55:17,904
And what about me?

882
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,317
I was almost killed.

883
00:55:20,688 --> 00:55:23,781
Let's forget about it.
And be ourselves.

884
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:26,085
You're Boomer;
and I am John Ma, ok?

885
00:55:26,428 --> 00:55:28,820
Tell me...
Did you sleep with Barbara?

886
00:55:29,799 --> 00:55:31,391
No! We didn't do anything.
Good!

887
00:55:32,435 --> 00:55:34,335
Just hide yourself.

888
00:55:40,009 --> 00:55:41,203
It's Tammy!

889
00:55:41,477 --> 00:55:43,877
Don't you think,
you should go hide upstairs.

890
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,078
OK.

891
00:55:53,355 --> 00:55:55,152
Hello.
It's me.

892
00:55:56,891 --> 00:55:59,088
Haven't you showered yet?
There's lots of people waiting.

893
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:02,356
I know, you go down first
and I will join you soon.

894
00:56:02,534 --> 00:56:03,523
Hold it.

895
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:05,829
Hmm... mm?

896
00:56:06,334 --> 00:56:08,112
Give me a kiss.

897
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,464
(WHISPERS)
" You scum!"

898
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,537
I'll wait downstairs.

899
00:56:17,447 --> 00:56:18,936
My purse?

900
00:56:21,951 --> 00:56:24,146
Hey, hold it!
Boomer, what are you doing?

901
00:56:24,553 --> 00:56:26,686
I'm filling the bath tub,
what does it look like?

902
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:28,887
This whole situation is
getting out of hand.

903
00:56:29,114 --> 00:56:31,554
Hey, Boomer,
what do we do?

904
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,859
This is ridiculous.

905
00:56:34,964 --> 00:56:36,261
I think I like Barbara a little.

906
00:56:36,264 --> 00:56:39,342
Don't even think about it.
Barbara is Tyson's girl, you hear?

907
00:56:42,477 --> 00:56:43,674
I don't even know Tyson.

908
00:56:44,815 --> 00:56:45,907
Wait a minute.

909
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:48,907
When you touch Tyson's girl;
it's like you're touching my girl.

910
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,611
So... stay away from her.
Do you hear?

911
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,285
But, you touched my girl already.

912
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:56,420
How could I know she's your girl.

913
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,152
It doesn't matter whether,
she is or not.

914
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:01,691
Don't mess around with her.

915
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:02,263
Wait.
Come back.

916
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:05,297
Are you telling me what to do?

917
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,797
One minute!

918
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:10,166
John Ma!

919
00:57:14,912 --> 00:57:16,004
Are you alright?

920
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:17,307
I'm fine!
I'm fine!

921
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,402
Huh?

922
00:57:19,783 --> 00:57:22,774
Why did you answer?
I'm John Ma.

923
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,217
She really thinks I'm you, I answer.

924
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,318
Hey, is there somebody
in there with you?

925
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:30,185
Wait! Tammy, is my girl.
I'm the one she likes.

926
00:57:30,293 --> 00:57:33,484
Not you, but John Ma!
Not Boomer, you hear?

927
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:37,331
I'm not so sure.
Besides, you already...

928
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:40,130
So you want her to know that,

929
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:42,228
she's been tricked. You impostor?

930
00:57:42,439 --> 00:57:43,637
John Ma!

931
00:57:44,004 --> 00:57:47,636
If you don't open the door,
I'll break it down!

932
00:57:47,642 --> 00:57:50,042
Uh... wait!
You'd better find a place to hide.

933
00:57:56,448 --> 00:57:58,642
You better not touch her.

934
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:01,925
Why did you do that?
I'm sorry.

935
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:03,598
Are you alright?
I'm fine!

936
00:58:03,804 --> 00:58:05,394
Who were you talking to?

937
00:58:08,407 --> 00:58:09,499
I fool you, didn't I.

938
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:11,702
I only pretended to
be two different people.

939
00:58:11,911 --> 00:58:14,311
Not bad, hey? I've showered.
Let's go downstairs.

940
00:58:14,432 --> 00:58:15,660
Oh.

941
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:20,870
Uh... oh.

942
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,318
Tammy!
What are you doing?

943
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,846
Now that I'm all wet. I need to take
a bath and change my clothes.

944
00:58:25,725 --> 00:58:26,817
A bath?

945
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:32,760
Will you excuse me,
I also need to take one.

946
00:58:33,532 --> 00:58:36,524
I know.
Let's take one together.

947
00:58:37,303 --> 00:58:38,395
I change my mind.

948
00:58:38,904 --> 00:58:40,701
We took a bath together,
the other day.

949
00:58:41,207 --> 00:58:42,606
We did?
Are you sure about that?

950
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:49,504
Yes, I am sure, and you didn't put your
hands all over me, you're were very nice.

951
00:58:49,713 --> 00:58:52,112
You dirty rat.
You took a bath with my girl.

952
00:58:52,348 --> 00:58:53,646
Huh?

953
00:58:54,085 --> 00:58:56,680
So, why are you undressed,
if you're not taking a bath?

954
00:58:56,856 --> 00:58:58,153
I guess I change my mind again.

955
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:00,190
I really got to try
to figure you out.

956
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,994
Hey!

957
00:59:06,996 --> 00:59:08,990
Why have you put your clothes back on?

958
00:59:11,736 --> 00:59:13,330
I need to keep them on, Tammy.

959
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:15,036
Hmm?

960
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:18,532
I must be seeing things.

961
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,644
Oh...
What are you doing?

962
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,239
Changing it!

963
00:59:24,418 --> 00:59:26,817
No, need to.
The water's clean.

964
00:59:27,486 --> 00:59:29,283
Didn't you just take a bath?

965
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:32,357
I always fill it up after I'm done.

966
00:59:32,426 --> 00:59:34,620
It's just another habit of mine!

967
00:59:35,127 --> 00:59:37,528
There is so very much
I have to learn about you.

968
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:43,193
So sweet.

969
00:59:43,703 --> 00:59:45,900
And I better start now,
since I'm already yours.

970
00:59:52,345 --> 00:59:55,002
Maybe it's better we don't
take a bath together.

971
00:59:55,004 --> 00:59:56,645
It could take us hours.

972
00:59:56,983 --> 00:59:58,881
The water is warm.

973
01:00:00,002 --> 01:00:00,998
Ah!

974
01:00:01,002 --> 01:00:02,004
Surprise!

975
01:00:02,955 --> 01:00:04,651
Let's take a bath together!

976
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:07,985
You're so horrible.

977
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:09,756
You're such a naughty boy.

978
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:13,320
They're all waiting.
We don't have enough time.

979
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:15,294
Forget about that.
Let go!

980
01:00:15,296 --> 01:00:16,492
Let's enjoy ourselves.

981
01:00:17,002 --> 01:00:18,754
Ah! Ah!

982
01:00:18,756 --> 01:00:19,904
Ah! Ah!

983
01:00:21,706 --> 01:00:23,697
It's just a reflection,
like in a movie.

984
01:00:24,808 --> 01:00:26,002
Mirror?!

985
01:00:26,906 --> 01:00:27,812
It's a mirror!

986
01:00:27,814 --> 01:00:29,774
You scared me to death.

987
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:30,969
I'm awfully sorry!
I'm awfully sorry!

988
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,000
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

989
01:00:34,002 --> 01:00:35,473
Who's that?

990
01:00:37,249 --> 01:00:38,341
Uh... Yes!

991
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:39,890
May I help you, Miss?

992
01:00:41,286 --> 01:00:43,481
Where's Boomer?

993
01:00:44,227 --> 01:00:45,358
Who did you say
you're looking for?

994
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,358
Boomer?

995
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,759
There must be a mistake?

996
01:00:48,762 --> 01:00:50,689
I was here earlier today.

997
01:00:50,832 --> 01:00:52,628
Boomer!
Barbara!

998
01:00:52,766 --> 01:00:56,046
I wish you would leave.
I'm just here with my boyfriend.

999
01:00:56,048 --> 01:00:57,529
Boomer!
Where are you?

1000
01:00:57,637 --> 01:00:58,529
Here we go again.

1001
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:01,034
Hey, Boomer!
Are you here?

1002
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:02,084
Wait!!

1003
01:01:02,886 --> 01:01:03,650
Hello.

1004
01:01:04,654 --> 01:01:06,764
Do you know this woman?

1005
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:08,873
What are you doing?

1006
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:11,683
And what kind of girl,
do you think I am?

1007
01:01:13,053 --> 01:01:14,247
What is it?

1008
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,346
Crazy Kung says, bring the
case to the dock,

1009
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:18,447
because, if you don't,

1010
01:01:18,992 --> 01:01:19,584
Tyson will be dead.

1011
01:01:20,588 --> 01:01:22,806
Well, who is she?

1012
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,294
What's wrong with you?
I thought you cared!

1013
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,731
And now I find you here
with this woman!

1014
01:01:29,869 --> 01:01:30,463
You've got a problem.

1015
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:34,902
Hey, wait a minute
I've had enough.

1016
01:01:35,642 --> 01:01:36,940
Who is she?

1017
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,137
Barbara.

1018
01:01:38,578 --> 01:01:39,567
And what's her name?

1019
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:41,668
She's Tammy.

1020
01:01:41,672 --> 01:01:42,977
His fiancée.

1021
01:01:43,185 --> 01:01:44,274
And we're going to get married.

1022
01:01:44,296 --> 01:01:45,760
You're getting married?

1023
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:47,750
Wait! Barbara...

1024
01:01:48,221 --> 01:01:51,721
You promised me, remember?
You can't go back on your word!

1025
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:53,956
Just close your eyes and imagine...

1026
01:01:54,093 --> 01:01:55,993
Did you tell her that?

1027
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:58,259
We agreed on a Spring wedding?

1028
01:01:58,699 --> 01:02:01,691
There's something important
you should know.

1029
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:05,066
Boomer!

1030
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,366
Where are you?!

1031
01:02:06,784 --> 01:02:07,990
Boomer!

1032
01:02:08,002 --> 01:02:09,560
Where are you?

1033
01:02:09,573 --> 01:02:11,673
He could be behind you.

1034
01:02:11,776 --> 01:02:14,266
Yes, he's just afraid.
He was scared of girls, that's why.

1035
01:02:14,379 --> 01:02:17,075
Come on out!

1036
01:02:20,082 --> 01:02:21,379
You'll see.

1037
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,121
Boomer!

1038
01:02:22,346 --> 01:02:24,998
I know you're there.
Come out.

1039
01:02:25,004 --> 01:02:26,083
Oh, no.

1040
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:28,024
I think I'm losing my mind.

1041
01:02:34,002 --> 01:02:35,112
I...

1042
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:40,732
Wait, I know...

1043
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:42,110
TV.

1044
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,122
Yes.

1045
01:02:50,188 --> 01:02:52,487
Huh?
Huh?

1046
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:54,348
Oh...
Oh...

1047
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,196
Huh?
Huh?

1048
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:58,298
He's real.

1049
01:03:00,794 --> 01:03:02,886
Oh...
Oh...

1050
01:03:04,898 --> 01:03:07,598
Boomer, Tyson's in trouble.
You have to find Kung, quick!

1051
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,597
If I only knew where
he was hiding?

1052
01:03:09,906 --> 01:03:12,330
Wait.
At the ship yards.

1053
01:03:12,332 --> 01:03:14,266
And you are suppose to
bring the briefcase with you.

1054
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:15,270
Then you look after them.

1055
01:03:15,342 --> 01:03:16,741
Hold it.
Aren't you coming back?

1056
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:21,311
If I survive, I will.

1057
01:03:24,881 --> 01:03:25,978
Mr. Ma! Mr. Ma!
Maestro! Maestro!

1058
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,004
Excuse me.

1059
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,917
Alright. Come to the
Conference room for the pictures!

1060
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,545
Thank you for your co-operation.

1061
01:03:33,693 --> 01:03:35,489
Hi there!

1062
01:03:39,298 --> 01:03:40,487
Mr. Ma!
Maestro!

1063
01:03:40,899 --> 01:03:41,298
This way...

1064
01:03:47,012 --> 01:03:48,232
Ah... Maestro!
Mr. Ma!

1065
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,680
Ah Maestro!
Boomer!

1066
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:57,681
Boomer,

1067
01:03:58,606 --> 01:04:00,082
we should be like brothers.
We're so alike.

1068
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:03,922
Fate, is a funny thing,
you know what I mean, cuz..

1069
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:07,219
If I had as many brains as you...

1070
01:04:07,326 --> 01:04:10,023
I could have turned out pretty good.

1071
01:04:10,216 --> 01:04:13,988
I'm honored to know
someone as loyal as you.

1072
01:04:16,296 --> 01:04:18,993
Let's get this done, together.
As friends.

1073
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,568
Let's go get Tyson.

1074
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:56,295
How do you do?

1075
01:04:56,298 --> 01:04:57,904
Skip it.
We're wasting time.

1076
01:05:29,004 --> 01:05:30,998
It's good to see you again.

1077
01:05:31,749 --> 01:05:33,149
Will, bring the briefcase here.

1078
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,420
I'll take that.

1079
01:05:34,652 --> 01:05:35,420
Hey, hey, hey!

1080
01:05:35,422 --> 01:05:36,821
I have a bomb!

1081
01:05:36,823 --> 01:05:37,884
Hand that over here.
All of you.

1082
01:05:37,886 --> 01:05:38,112
Back off!

1083
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:40,912
Back off!
It's full of explosives!

1084
01:05:40,914 --> 01:05:42,988
Do you hear me?!
Don't come near me?!

1085
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:44,187
If I drop it, we will all die!

1086
01:05:50,802 --> 01:05:53,398
I'll check the other side.
Yeah, fine.

1087
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:00,866
What are you looking at?
Huh?

1088
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:16,150
Where's Tyson?

1089
01:06:16,493 --> 01:06:18,085
He's up there!

1090
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:20,925
Hey, Boomer!
Help me!

1091
01:06:21,065 --> 01:06:23,161
I'm stuck!

1092
01:06:24,303 --> 01:06:25,794
Up here!

1093
01:06:26,306 --> 01:06:28,001
Are you really, Tyson?

1094
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:31,065
Don't kid around, Boomer!

1095
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:33,804
Can you say something
to prove who you are?

1096
01:06:33,913 --> 01:06:35,512
Yeah, when we were kids...

1097
01:06:36,236 --> 01:06:41,112
AHHH!!!

1098
01:06:43,722 --> 01:06:45,314
He's such a crack-up, ain't he?

1099
01:06:52,793 --> 01:06:54,192
Hand over the briefcase, huh?

1100
01:06:54,395 --> 01:06:56,794
Or goodbye to your buddy,
you know what I mean?

1101
01:07:08,002 --> 01:07:09,006
Move over.

1102
01:07:10,431 --> 01:07:13,729
Hey, Boss! Boss we got trouble!
There's another guy!

1103
01:07:14,867 --> 01:07:16,566
Boomer, HELP!

1104
01:07:19,772 --> 01:07:21,175
Ah... help me!

1105
01:07:25,002 --> 01:07:26,807
That was your last chance.

1106
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:30,140
Ahh!!
What have I done?

1107
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:35,611
That was close.

1108
01:07:36,022 --> 01:07:38,812
Give me that case.

1109
01:07:39,988 --> 01:07:41,479
It's a bomb!

1110
01:07:44,735 --> 01:07:46,929
Any closer and
this will explode!

1111
01:07:48,705 --> 01:07:51,298
Alright, I've had about enough of this.
Get him!

1112
01:07:52,442 --> 01:07:53,842
Step aside!

1113
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,242
Wait, take it easy, Boss.

1114
01:08:00,288 --> 01:08:01,778
No, wait.
Look at that.

1115
01:08:08,631 --> 01:08:09,724
Somebody, go check it out.

1116
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,104
Go on!

1117
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:24,313
Ahh!!

1118
01:08:28,762 --> 01:08:30,358
Go!
Go on, after him!

1119
01:08:52,206 --> 01:08:53,298
Now what?

1120
01:08:55,308 --> 01:08:57,299
Tyson, get out of here!

1121
01:09:01,411 --> 01:09:02,708
Let's get out of here.

1122
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,912
I trying, but I hurt my leg.

1123
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:09,315
Hey, what the hell?
How did you get down here, so fast?

1124
01:09:09,417 --> 01:09:11,317
What are you talking about?
I've been down here the whole time.

1125
01:09:11,753 --> 01:09:14,153
My leg. My leg.

1126
01:09:19,222 --> 01:09:20,519
Come on!

1127
01:09:38,657 --> 01:09:41,352
AHHH!

1128
01:09:55,002 --> 01:09:56,008
Alright, ...uh.

1296
01:24:07,507 --> 01:24:08,405
Stop there!

1297
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,109
Huh, there's two of you?

1298
01:24:12,245 --> 01:24:13,143
There's just one of us.

1299
01:24:13,246 --> 01:24:14,144
Just one?

1300
01:24:14,247 --> 01:24:16,339
You're seeing things.

1301
01:24:19,449 --> 01:24:20,643
Ah.

1302
01:24:20,821 --> 01:24:22,119
Get on the ground!

1303
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:23,254
Move it!

1304
01:24:25,203 --> 01:24:26,500
There are two of you!

1305
01:24:29,004 --> 01:24:31,006
<i>" Caution. Caution."</i>

1306
01:24:35,002 --> 01:24:36,542
<i>" Speed Test."</i>

1307
01:24:36,544 --> 01:24:38,112
John!

1308
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:41,107
Where is the seat belt?

1309
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,998
Whoa... no!

1310
01:24:45,517 --> 01:24:50,920
<i>" Estimated survival rate of passengers
without seat belts zero percent."</i>

1311
01:24:50,922 --> 01:24:52,922
<i>" Please, replace test dummy."</i>

1312
01:24:56,034 --> 01:24:57,935
It's so beautiful.
Thanks!

1313
01:25:06,841 --> 01:25:08,069
What's taking them so long?

1314
01:25:10,045 --> 01:25:12,745
I'm very anxious to meet
the man who looks like John.

1315
01:25:12,947 --> 01:25:14,244
I hope he really is our son.

1316
01:25:14,349 --> 01:25:16,748
Now, momma. Don't get your
hopes up too high. You promised.

1317
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,208
Yes, of course.
I won't.

1318
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:19,416
Father, mother...

1319
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:23,008
I still haven't seen Boomer.
I don't know where he is?

1320
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:27,780
I'm afraid the wedding
will have to be cancelled.

1321
01:25:27,782 --> 01:25:28,702
Cancelled?!

1322
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,731
Wait here, I have to find Boomer.

1323
01:25:33,067 --> 01:25:34,762
John!

1324
01:25:36,004 --> 01:25:37,142
Stop!

1325
01:25:42,502 --> 01:25:44,301
Where have you been?

1326
01:25:44,437 --> 01:25:45,927
(SNORTS) Did you have to
bring the whole crowd?

1327
01:25:46,072 --> 01:25:48,868
I can't believe it, our son?
That's our boy?

1328
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:54,736
What do we do?

1329
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:55,736
We get out of here, right now!

1330
01:25:55,738 --> 01:25:56,712
Let's go!

1331
01:25:57,281 --> 01:25:59,182
Are you alright?
They're getting away!

1332
01:26:02,717 --> 01:26:04,309
I've got you.
Are you Boomer or John?

1333
01:26:04,653 --> 01:26:06,247
You're not getting away that easy.
Come on.

1334
01:26:12,289 --> 01:26:13,781
That one's Boomer.

1335
01:26:13,783 --> 01:26:14,426
No, that's Boomer.
Or is it John?

1336
01:26:17,363 --> 01:26:18,455
Which one of you is John?

1337
01:26:22,565 --> 01:26:23,554
You're ...uh?

1338
01:26:23,556 --> 01:26:25,492
(SNORTS)
(SNORTS)

1339
01:26:28,637 --> 01:26:30,729
Now, what do we do?

1340
01:26:31,073 --> 01:26:32,770
It doesn't make any difference!!
