They'll play a well out for all it's got.

643
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,816
Then they take the deadly toxins
they have from everywhere else...

644
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,257
...they'll reverse the pumps,
blow it back in there, top it off with crude.

645

Or they'll broker the space
to another company.

I know the press. Let's contact the press.

656

Haven't you learned anything
from my father?

What do you want me to learn, Masu?

658
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:08,775
Do you really think that this hocus-pocus
spirit stuff is gonna help us now?

659
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:12,730
What do you think, an angel will
miraculously come down out of the sky...

660
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:16,256
...and stop, say 350 billion tons of oil
from being spilled...

661
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,251
...into our oceans every year?

662
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,099
Maybe a ghost will stop all the cars
from using gasoline.

663
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,693
Maybe somehow...

664
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,416
...some spirit will trip the big switch...

665
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,810
...and the technology that's been
repressed for the last 70 years...

666
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:33,098
...will suddenly be ours and it'll be
a better place to live, a beautiful place.

667
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:37,139
Maybe I should send my spirit guide over
to Aegis-1 and stop it from going on-line...

hard reality of this world.

I don't have a choice and I'm not taking
any chances this time...

I'll go into the mountains
over the back ridge.

I don't think anybody will be able
to follow us up there by horseback.

679
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,492
Give me this FX shotgun
with all the magazines and ammo you got.

953
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:03,252
Listen to me. I'll make a path.
You stay on my heels and don't look back!

[Tires screech]

956
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:00,371
FORREST: I'd like to start off by saying...

957
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,688
...thank you...

958
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:04,500
...to the brothers and sisters
who've come here today...

959
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,218
...representing this cause.

960
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,814
l've been asked by Mr. lttok
and the Tribal Council...

961
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:12,609
...to speak to you and the press
about the injustices brought against us...

962
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:15,419
...by some government officials
and big business.

963
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:18,618
How many ofyou out there have heard
of alternative engines...

964
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:22,295
...engines that can run on anything
from alcohol to garbage or water?

965
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,531
Or carburetors that can get
hundreds of miles to the gallon?

966
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:29,135
Or electric or magnetic engines
that can practically run forever?

967
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,451
You don't know about them,
because if they were to come into use...

968
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,770
...they'd put the oil companies
out of business.

969
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:39,058
The concept of the internal combustion
engine has been obsolete for over 50 years.

970
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:42,450
But because of the oil cartels
and corrupt government regulation...

971
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:46,977
...we and the rest of the world have been
forced to use gasoline for over 100 years.

972
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:49,654
Big business is primarily responsible
for destroying...

973
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:53,130
...the water we drink, the air we breathe
and the food we eat.

974
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,209
They have no care
for the world they destroy...

975
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,894
...only for the money
they make in the process.

976
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,330
How many oil spills can we endure?

977
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:04,056
Millions and millions of gallons of oil...

978
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:07,337
...are destroying the ocean
and the many forms of life it supports.

979
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:11,777
Among these is plankton, which supplies
60 to 90% of the earth's oxygen.

980
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:14,130
lt supports the entire marine ecosystem...

981
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:17,257
...which forms the basis
of our planet's food supply.

982
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:19,572
But the plankton is dying.

983
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,617
l thought, ''Well, let's go
to some remote state or country...

984
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,213
''...anywhere on earth.''

985
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,495
But in doing a little research, I realized...

986
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:30,731
...that these people broker toxic waste
all over the world.

987
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:34,779
They basically control the legislation and,
in fact, they control the law.

988
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:39,538
The law says no company
can be fined over $25,000 a day.

989
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:42,376
lf a company's making $10 million a day...

990
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,849
...by dumping lethal toxic waste
into the ocean...

991
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:47,738
...it's only good business
to continue doing this.

992
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:50,812
They influence the media
so that they can control our minds.

993
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:53,209
They've made it a crime
to speak out for ourselves.

994
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:56,656
lf we do so, we're called conspiracy nuts
and we're laughed at.

995
01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:00,210
We're angry because we're all being
chemically and genetically damaged...

996
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,131
...and we don't even realize it.

997
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:04,859
Unfortunately, this will affect our children.

998
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,409
We go to work each day
and right under our noses...

999
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,812
...we see our car and the car in front of us
spewing noxious, poisonous gases...

1000
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,410
...that are all accumulative poisons.

1001
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,136
These poisons kill us slowly,
even when we see no effect.

1002
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:22,010
How many of us would've believed
if we were told 20 years ago...

1003
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:25,888
...that on a certain day we wouldn't be able
to see 50 feet in front of us...

1004
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:28,369
...that we wouldn't be able
to take a deep breath...

1005
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:31,372
...because the air would be a mass
ofpoisonous gas.

1006
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:33,610
That we couldn't drink out of our faucets...

1007
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:36,294
...that we'd have to buy water
out of bottles.

1008
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:40,016
Our most common and God-given rights
have been taken away from us.

1009
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,294
Unfortunately...

1010
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:45,055
...the reality of our lives is so grim
that nobody wants to hear it.

1011
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:47,091
I've been asked what we can do.

1012
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:51,818
l think we need a responsible body
ofpeople that can actually represent us...

1013
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,379
...rather than big business.

1014
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,291
This body ofpeople must not allow...

1015
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:59,692
...the introduction of anything into our
environment that is not biodegradable...

1016
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,372
...or able to be chemically neutralized
upon production.

1017
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:08,332
Finally, as long as there's profit to be made
from the polluting of our earth...

1018
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,970
...companies and individuals will continue
to do what they want.

1019
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:16,294
We have to force these companies
to operate safely and responsibly...

1020
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:20,368
...with all our best interests in mind,
so that when they don't...

1021
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:25,011
...we can take back our resources and our
hearts and our minds, and do what's right.

1022
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,214
[Applause]

NATIVE AMERICAN:
Kompasla, great spirit, bless the people...

1024
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:35,211
...all the grandmas, all the grandpas,
and the little ones.

1025
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,611
We have the four directions...

1026
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:39,412
...and l want to bless...

1027
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:43,739
...the future generation
and the Indian nation, our people...

1028
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:45,652
...to be strong again.
