- Mayor Wando.
- Hi. Rachel.

301
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,022
lt's a pleasure indeed.
Uh, what's going on here ?

302
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:52,063
l've recommended to the council members
they put this town on alert.

303
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,749
They were just about
to vote on it.

304
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,623
- Can l have a word with you outside ?
- Sure.

305
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,548
Excuse us.

306
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,066
- [ Man ] Who the hell is this guy ?
- l sent you here to look around,

307
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,903
not to scare the hell
out of the city council.

308
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,989
But two people are dead.
Recommending an alert seemed
the only responsible thing to do.

309
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,586
There are dozens of reasons that would
account for what happened there.

310
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,942
Anything from a mild earthquake
to a slight seismic shift.

311
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:24,069
Not one of them means the mountain's
gonna blow up next week or next month...

312
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,985
- or the next hundred years.
- [ Les ] The whole spirit
of the town was on its way up.

313
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,066
[ Woman ]
Just thinks he can walk in here--

314
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,898
Ladies and gentlemen, l am sure
Dr Dalton was doing...

315
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,020
what he thought was
in your town's best interests.

316
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,908
However, l have learned
through bitter experience...

317
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,029
that these decisions
are not to be made lightly.

318
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,858
Back in 1980, l would have
bet you a million bucks...

319
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,787
that Mammoth Mountain
was about to go up.

320
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:55,382
We began to talk about the possibility
of putting that town on alert.

321
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,580
Thank God the mountain didn't go up,

322
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,501
but the damage had already been done.

323
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,980
The word leaked out that the
U.S.G.S. had expressed concern.

324
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,745
So the tourists panicked
and stayed away.

325
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,664
The real estate values plummeted,
and the town nearly went bankrupt.

326
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,628
Consequently, l'm now
a lot more cautious...

327
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,907
when it comes to even talking
about putting a town on alert.

328
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,821
Now, folks,
understand something.

329
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,266
We are gonna be camped out here
for as long as it takes...

330
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,502
with seismometres and tiltmetres
that are gonna measure and monitor...

331
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,706
every little hiccup
that the mountain makes.

332
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,662
We'll be bouncing laser beams off it
to track any changes in size.

333
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,822
We'll be analyzing
gas emissions.

334
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,380
We've got a robot that's gonna stroll
up there and take its temperature.

335
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,509
Now, believe me, l'm not trying
to make light of your concerns.

336
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,141
But l want you to understand
if the time comes to call for an alert--

337
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,940
lf the time comes, it will be based
upon scientific evidence...

338
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:57,058
and not upon anyone's opinion.

339
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,301
For God's sake, Rachel,
this thing...

340
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,984
should have been handled
much more discreetly.

341
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,220
- This meeting never
should have been called.
- Harry.

342
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,985
[ Les ] l just hope our Mr Blair
didn't get wind of this.

343
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:13,063
You're making a big mistake, Paul.
This is an unstable system.

344
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,981
This town should be on alert.

345
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,028
You need a vacation.
l'll see you in two weeks.

346
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,661
We got some serious
damage control to do.

347
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,942
lf they get scared off, Rachel,
you're the one's responsible.

348
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,060
Any questions ?
l'll be happy to answer them.

349
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,381
[ Chattering ]

350
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,907
[ Sighs ]

351
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,707
- How about a nice adult beverage ?
- Excellent.

352
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,145
Sounds good to me.

353
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,461
[ Chattering,
Pinball Machines Clicking ]

354
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,064
Give me just a minute here.

355
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:34,860
Thought you'd be off
on your fishin' vacation by now.

356
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,989
- Decided to stick around.
- l can see that. Question is, why ?

357
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,907
'Cause this town's in trouble.

358
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,663
l'm the best man you got.

359
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,786
Whiskey.

360
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,067
[ Hand Thumps Bar ]

361
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,704
You are the best man l've got.

362
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,102
But until you can get it in your
head there are politics involved...

363
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,750
delicate politics,
not to mention economics,

364
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,027
you're only gonna do these people
more harm than good.

365
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,021
- l understand.
- [ Man ] There ya are.

366
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,386
Tomorrow morning,
l'm gonna hire a helicopter,

367
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,986
fly around the mountain,
see how much sulphur dioxide is there.

368
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,823
- Okay.
- From now on everything comes from me.

369
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,062
Any more town meetings to be called,
l'll be the one to call them.

370
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,300
Okay ?

371
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,181
Okay.

a regular coffee ?

Sure.

380

last night.

381

Uh, yes. Well, l decided to stay. See
what new trouble l can get myself into.

up your reelection chances, eh ?

l've always been better at figuring out
volcanoes than people and politics.

l'm sorry if l caused you any trouble.

For saving Graham's life...

head for that rock formation over there.

What you got back there ?
How's it lookin' ?

Minimal sulphur dioxide emissions.
There's nothing to worry about.

We're green
across the board.

any kind of activity here. She's quiet.

Wherever there's a volcano
with an attitude.
