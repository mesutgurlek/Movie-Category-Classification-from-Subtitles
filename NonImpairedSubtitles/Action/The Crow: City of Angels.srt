1
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,443
I believe there is a place
where the restless souls wander.

2
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:35,239
Burdened by the weight
of their own sadness,

3
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,908
they wait for a chance
to set the wrong things right.

4
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,330
Only then can they be reunited
with the ones they love.

5
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,835
Sometimes a crow
shows them the way.

6
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,923
- Because sometimes...

7
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,717
- Love is stronger than death.

8
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,030
- It's not your fault.

9
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,701
- No, no, no.
- We didn't see.

10
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,248
Let him go!
He's just a kid!

11
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,500
He can't hurt you!

12
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm scared, Dad.
Please, Dad, I'm sorry.

13
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,798
- No!

14
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,274
Gabriel...

15
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,193
it's been a long night.

16
00:03:55,402 --> 00:04:01,533
Caressing the marble
and stone

17
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:08,207
Caressing the marble
and stone

18
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:15,797
Ah, love that was
special for one

19
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:24,515
The waste in the fever I feel

20
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,979
How I wish you were
here with me now

21
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,322
They call this
"The City of Angels,"

22
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,992
but all I see around me
are victims.

23
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,787
It's the city of drugs...

24
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,498
and of darkness.

25
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,251
The city of Judah Earl.

26
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,047
Got a name?

27
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:02,469
Grace. So what?

28
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,600
My name is Sarah.

29
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,989
Listen, Grace, maybe you want
to get some hot coffee...

30
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,993
and a little bit of food.

31
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,953
What do you want?

32
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,375
Nothing.

33
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,382
Do you want to eat here?

34
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,910
We all have our pleasures.

35
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,704
For some, it's the flesh.

36
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,832
And we provide for them.

37
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,543
For others, it's the drugs.

38
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:20,130
- And we provide for them too.

39
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,300
Our products feed this entire city.

40
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,055
While other kingdoms fall around us,

41
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,808
we've succeeded...

42
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,187
by being of a single mind.

43
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,733
Succeeded with guidance
from a darker world, Judah.

44
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,531
Do you love me, Sibyl?

45
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:49,243
All must love you.

46
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,161
Really?

47
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:55,999
Then why did this sad-eyed
sack of shit betray me?

48
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,335
Hey, well, l...

49
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,880
Hey, l-l-l-I didn't
betray you, Judah.

50
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,299
I-I-I did it for
the business, you know?

51
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,927
I mean, this last...
Batch of yours,

52
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,681
it was bad...
it was a hot mix.

53
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,350
I mean, Jesus Christ, Judah,

54
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,937
it was given 'em seizures...
whoa, get away.

55
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,439
Hey, Judah, your...

56
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,025
your brand...

57
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,570
It should inspire trust, right?

58
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:28,073
I mean, come on, we can't kill off
all the motherfuckers, huh?

59
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,285
I mean, hey, whoa, there'd be
no one left to buy the shit.

60
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,955
So you destroyed 80 keys
of product without my consent.

61
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,915
Hey, hey, back off!

62
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,334
Get the fuck away from me!

63
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,337
Look at this, Judah. You're surrounded
by these fuckin' freaks, man!

64
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,591
You don't even leave
this fun house anymore, man!

65
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,427
I mean, you have no idea what
the shit is doing to people...

66
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,345
out on the streets, man.

67
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,681
It could ruin your fix with the cops.
I'm not bullshittin'.

68
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,018
I mean, it's bad
for business, huh?

69
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,939
All right, then.

70
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,817
Let's see how bad
this batch of ours really is.

71
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,820
Hey! Whoa! Hey!

72
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,947
What the fuck
is goin' on?

73
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,617
We're volunteering you
for a little quality control.

74
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,495
Oh, jeez, Judah.
I'll make it up to you, I swear!

75
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,750
But you are. Weren't you
listening before, Bassett?

76
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,295
I said we all have
our pleasures.

77
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,506
Mine is the pain of others.

78
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,475
Guess you were right, Bassett.

79
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,438
That was a bad batch.

80
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,440
- Whoo!

81
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,495
I'm almost done.

82
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,706
- Are you okay?
- It stings a little.

83
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,626
That's why they call me
the mistress of pain.

84
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,837
I'll get the other book
out for you.

85
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,464
Let's see this masterpiece.
Go ahead, turn around.

86
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,092
Whew. Spin 'round a little.

87
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,679
Ho, ho, ho. There's nothin'
I can do for you, luv.

88
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,934
Christ, what a downer!

89
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,812
Some kid asked me to tattoo,

90
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,731
"If you can read this,
you're standin' too close."

91
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,942
Right on her bum.

92
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,902
I tell ya, I've had it.

93
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,947
Well, it's better than
pushing ink in Detroit.

94
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,074
Well, you can say
that again, darlin'.

95
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,243
You can say that again.

96
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,203
- I got a little present for you.
- You did?

97
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,623
They do them for
the Day of the Dead.

98
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,625
Thank you.

99
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,545
"Necrophagia,"darlin'...
eat the dead.

100
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,510
"Life is just a dream
on the way to death."

101
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,890
I like that.

102
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,309
Do you want to come
have a beer, girl?

103
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,227
Um, no, I can't.

104
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,939
I gotta go home. I haven't been
getting that much sleep lately.

105
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,442
And what is
the dirty dog's name?

106
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,320
No, I've just...

107
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,199
I've just been having these
really, really strange dreams.

108
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,785
I know.

109
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,106
Sleep with angels.

110
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,692
Sleep with angels.

111
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,376
- Did l...

112
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:53,463
No!

113
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:53,292
Talk to me, Sibyl.
Tell me what you see.

114
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:59,381
I see death returning
from the vale of tears.

115
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,885
Look at them down there,

116
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:07,181
swarming through
the streets like insects.

117
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,350
It's the same each year, isn't it?

118
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,769
Lighting their little candles.

119
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,647
Whispering their wasted prayers.

120
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,691
This time is different, Judah.

121
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:22,029
This time someone is coming for you.

122
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,741
He has your name
on his tongue.

123
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,537
It's finally
beginning, isn't it?

124
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,623
What mask will death wear?

125
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,541
Can you tell me that?

126
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:40,547
I see the face
of one of your victims.

127
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,513
All my sins remembered.

128
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,322
And what's this
in your ear?

129
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:01,133
Toro, toro!

130
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:03,095
- Ole!

131
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,972
Look.

132
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:38,078
- Who are you?
- Sarah.

133
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,904
I had a dream about you.

134
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:51,766
I saw them shoot you
and your son.

135
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,070
I saw you drowning.

136
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,823
How did I survive?

137
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,785
You didn't.

138
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,705
- You're dead.
- No!

139
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:07,916
No!

140
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:10,327
This isn't real.

141
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,113
None of this is real.

142
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:14,957
No!

143
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:27,477
Where will we go

144
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,524
Oh, where will we go

145
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:38,196
This ghost follows

146
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,115
Ah, yes

147
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:41,870
Hey, Dad.

148
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:45,290
- Yeah?
- Look, I made this.

149
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:46,751
- Who are they?
- These people?

150
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,086
- Yeah.
- That's you and me.

151
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,380
That's me? And the thing
on top over there?

152
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:54,717
That?
That's a blue sun.

153
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,344
- A blue sun?
- Yeah, a blue sun.

154
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:02,975
What was that?

155
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:05,144
Danny, stay here!

156
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,066
Danny!

157
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:18,324
Come here.
Come here.

158
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,662
Danny!

159
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,794
See no evil.

160
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:33,798
- No! No!
- You the monkey.

161
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,341
Run! Run! Uuh!

162
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:38,103
No! No!

163
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:40,504
Leave him alone !

164
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:43,005
Danny !
Dad !

165
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:45,509
No-o-o! No!

166
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,938
I wanna help you.

167
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,170
Danny.

168
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:23,547
He's not here anymore.

169
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:29,803
I know.

170
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,315
What's your name?

171
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:47,021
Ashe.

172
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:51,859
There's a reason why you've been
brought back, Ashe.

173
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:57,115
To find the people
who did this to us.

174
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:02,912
To make them pay.

175
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:56,507
These were Danny's paints,
weren't they?

176
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:56,734
Hey, old man
Got something for you

177
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:02,323
- Change your mind
Gonna make you take it

178
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:07,537
- Your mistake
is something you own

179
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,917
And I'm the one
who's gonna take it

180
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:17,839
Hey, old man
Got something for you

181
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:20,133
Got something for you
Got something for you

182
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:22,635
Hey, old man
Got a real good tip

183
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:25,304
- Got a real good tip

184
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:28,266
- Something's wrong
and you don't know it

185
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:30,601
You don't know it
You don't know it

186
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:34,564
When will you learn

187
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,777
I'm not your boy

188
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:44,907
You don't look back

189
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:51,748
Why do I pick up
your slack, man

190
00:22:56,878 --> 00:23:01,966
When will you learn

191
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:07,597
I'm not your boy

192
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,059
Hey, old man
Got something for you

193
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:14,270
Gonna...

194
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:43,841
- Ahh!

195
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:45,219
- Ooh!

196
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:03,653
- Whoop!

197
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:05,571
- Toro!

198
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:07,573
- Ah-ha-ha-ha!

199
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:24,632
Who the fuck are you?

200
00:24:24,716 --> 00:24:28,011
- Does the corpse have a familiar face?

201
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:37,152
- Flowers for the dead, sen'or?

202
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:40,155
We killed you, man.
You're dead!

203
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:43,617
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- Whoo-oo-oo!

204
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:49,706
Stop wasting your breath, angelito.
There's nobody out there listening.

205
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,044
- Yee-aagh!
- I'm all your nightmares...
rolled into one!

206
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:57,089
- Wuh-aah!

207
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,595
Aa-aa-aah!

208
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:12,187
Oh, geez! No way, man!

209
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:30,622
- Fuck! Oh!

210
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:34,084
This shit's flammable, man.

211
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:37,295
- The others. Who are they?

212
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:42,759
- Huh?
Nemo, Kali, Curve and Judah.

213
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:45,079
- I'll start with Nemo...

214
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:48,056
And then work my way
up the food chain.

215
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:50,142
- Where is he?
- Nemo?

216
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:51,090
- Mm-hmm.
- He's an old pervert.

217
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:53,882
He hangs out at the Peep-O-Rama
on Deacon Street.

218
00:25:56,524 --> 00:25:58,109
Congratulations, Monkey!

219
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,945
You just bought yourself
a fighting chance!

220
00:26:03,572 --> 00:26:05,407
Pick a card, Monkey.

221
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,326
Come on.

222
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,957
Come on.

223
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:29,598
Lady Luck's... a bitch.

224
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:32,267
Oh...

225
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:34,853
Jesus, man. Come on, man.

226
00:26:34,937 --> 00:26:36,772
Come on, come on, come on.

227
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,393
You're wasting your breath,
angelito.

228
00:26:41,853 --> 00:26:45,273
- Nobody's up there listening.

229
00:26:57,026 --> 00:27:00,550
I want to be your
Be your rubber ball

230
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:02,673
- I want to be the one

231
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:04,500
You love the most of all

232
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:06,961
Oh, yeah

233
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:11,674
- I'm your boogie man, boogie man

234
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:13,801
Turn me on

235
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:17,138
I'm your boogie man, boogie man
I'll do what you want

236
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:19,849
I'm your boogie man
Boogie man

237
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:22,101
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man

238
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,769
Ohh...

239
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:55,319
I got bad news. Someone torched
the lab on Manchester.

240
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:57,780
Spider Monkey's
a fucking crispy critter.

241
00:28:57,864 --> 00:29:00,867
Monkey I could care less about.
What about our merchandise?

242
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,412
- It's a total loss.
- He left a sign, didn't he?

243
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:06,789
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

244
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:07,540
Yes, you do.

245
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:10,918
You've seen it.
You've been marked.

246
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,797
Jesus Christ. Judah, why the fuck
do you listen to her?

247
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,508
Because she speaks the truth.

248
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:20,762
What's this, Curve?

249
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:22,972
A beauty mark?

250
00:29:25,624 --> 00:29:29,628
And all the world
will be in love with night.

251
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:33,591
And pay no worship
to the garish sun.

252
00:29:36,093 --> 00:29:37,928
- Noah?
- Yeah.

253
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,684
Do you believe in fate?

254
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:49,741
Seems to me it's a question
of... fate believin' in you.

255
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:57,674
- We're closed for the night!

256
00:29:57,675 --> 00:29:59,351
- Open the fucking door!

257
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,771
I said, we're closed. Aah!

258
00:30:03,854 --> 00:30:05,690
- Fucker!

259
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,776
- Think what you did to me was funny?
- God...

260
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:10,695
- Some kind of joke? Huh?
- Stop! It hurts me!

261
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:11,362
Huh? Huh?

262
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:14,240
I don't know what
you're talking about.

263
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:17,368
I'm talkin' about this fuckin' tattoo
you gave me! Look at this shit!

264
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:19,745
- It's a crow.
- You're goddamn right it's a crow.

265
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:22,123
Did I ask you for
a fuckin' bird on my chest? Did I?

266
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:24,792
I was going from the fucking design
that you gave me!

267
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,336
Stop it! Stop it!

268
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,255
O-Oh!

269
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:33,217
Well, what's it gonna be, hero?

270
00:30:33,301 --> 00:30:35,761
Ready to kiss your faggot ass
good-bye?

271
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:40,141
I think you're shittin' yourself,
you're so goddamn ready.

272
00:30:40,224 --> 00:30:42,560
Fuck you!
Uuh!

273
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:47,732
- You fucking piece of shit!

274
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:51,110
- Aah!
- Get up.

275
00:30:51,193 --> 00:30:55,364
- Girl to girl sincerity

276
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:58,159
Remains

277
00:30:58,242 --> 00:31:00,536
Awkwardly unnamed

278
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:08,377
- You never kissed
- I'll be seein' you...

279
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:10,546
- These girlfriend
- sugarplum.

280
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,673
- Lips

281
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:18,554
Simple choice to fall away
Fall away

282
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:22,016
Away, away, away

283
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:25,978
Away

284
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:27,897
Why is the world

285
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:33,277
- Falling on me
- Are you okay?

286
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:35,863
Well, fuck me. What are they
going to be snorting next?

287
00:31:35,946 --> 00:31:38,949
- I can't take this anymore.

288
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:40,910
Don't worry, love.

289
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:43,788
Everything'll work itself out.

290
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:09,138
- Tokens for the bunny booths.

291
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,099
- Live girls.

292
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,600
- Tokens for the bunny booths.

293
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:15,801
- Live girls.

294
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:19,318
What up, Zeek?

295
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,319
How ya doin', man?

296
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,429
Right.

297
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:25,098
This is for you.
For you.

298
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:49,999
You got a name?

299
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:52,501
- Holly Daze.
- Put your hands in the air

300
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:55,755
Tonight is a special night

301
00:32:55,838 --> 00:32:58,007
- You want me, baby?
- Put your hands in the air

302
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:01,260
Tonight is a special night
Check this one

303
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:01,719
Oh...

304
00:33:01,802 --> 00:33:03,804
Throw your hands
in the air tonight

305
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:05,473
Uh... I wanna see some sugar.

306
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:08,142
Check me out, Pop
Throw your hands high in the air

307
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:08,476
Sugar?

308
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,811
- Right on, sister.

309
00:33:14,315 --> 00:33:18,110
Mmm. Is that for me?

310
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:20,071
Oh, yeah.

311
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:23,240
Yeah.

312
00:33:23,324 --> 00:33:26,452
We're gonna celebrate Christmas
a little early this year.

313
00:33:32,124 --> 00:33:37,213
Mmm. Keep doin' that, baby,
you're gonna go blind.

314
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:40,341
- Fuck! Fuck!

315
00:33:49,308 --> 00:33:51,185
Oh, yes!

316
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:56,399
Time's almost up, lover.

317
00:33:56,482 --> 00:33:58,150
Hurry with those tokens.

318
00:33:58,234 --> 00:34:00,319
- Oh, shit, man!

319
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:09,120
Come on!

320
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:11,038
Bitch!

321
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:14,417
Come on, fucker!
Come on, fucker!

322
00:34:23,342 --> 00:34:25,678
Do you want me...

323
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:29,140
baby?

324
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:32,268
You...

325
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:34,186
Me.

326
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:41,235
- Hey! Fuckin'mime boy!

327
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,991
- Uuh!

328
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:51,412
One crow, sorrow.

329
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:53,331
Two crows...

330
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:55,583
joy!

331
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:59,378
- Three crows...
- Oh, ah!

332
00:34:59,462 --> 00:35:01,964
A letter!

333
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,177
- Four crows...
- Uuh!

334
00:35:06,218 --> 00:35:09,638
- Uuh! Aah!
- A boy.

335
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:12,516
- Let him go! He's just a child.

336
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,896
Uuh! Uh! Aah!

337
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:20,900
- Five crows, silver!
- Aah!

338
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:23,069
- Six crows, gold!

339
00:35:23,152 --> 00:35:27,239
Seven crows,
a secret never to be told!

340
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:30,242
Aah! Stop the fuck...
Aah! Please!

341
00:35:30,326 --> 00:35:32,161
No, please!

342
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:37,166
- Please, just stop! I can't...
- Look at me!

343
00:35:37,249 --> 00:35:40,336
Lights! Camera! Action!

344
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:43,339
- Aah!
- You killed my son, Nemo.

345
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:45,925
You took away the only
piece of light left in my soul.

346
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:49,595
We had to! We had to!
It wasn't our fault!

347
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:53,516
Was Judah's orders.
Never leave any witnesses.

348
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,560
We didn't have any choice.

349
00:35:56,644 --> 00:35:59,063
We always have a choice!

350
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:06,654
- Tokens for the bunny booths.
- Go, let's go!

351
00:36:06,737 --> 00:36:09,865
- Live girls.
- Ow! Yeah!

352
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:12,535
- Tokens for the bunny booths.
- Let's go!

353
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:15,204
- Live girls.

354
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,915
- Tokens for the bunny booths.

355
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:20,292
Live girls.

356
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:23,671
Tokens for the bunny booths.

357
00:36:23,754 --> 00:36:27,466
Live girls.

358
00:36:27,508 --> 00:36:29,510
Tokens for the bunny booths.
Live...

359
00:36:29,593 --> 00:36:30,886
In my room I want you here

360
00:36:34,473 --> 00:36:38,019
Now we're gonna be
face to face

361
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:45,526
And I lay right down in my
favorite place

362
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:46,485
Holy fuck.

363
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:20,227
Do you know what they call
a gathering of crows... Curve?

364
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:22,980
- A murder.

365
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:26,484
A murder of crows.

366
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:29,278
Think about it.

367
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:21,914
Can I help you?

368
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:26,877
I'm sorry, Father.

369
00:38:30,756 --> 00:38:33,050
I was just watching.

370
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:34,969
Our doors were open.

371
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:38,139
What's all this for?

372
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:41,058
Dia de los Muertos.
Day of the Dead.

373
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:43,936
We light candles
for our loved ones...

374
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:46,022
so they might find their way
back to Earth.

375
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:48,232
Tomorrow night
we will celebrate.

376
00:38:48,315 --> 00:38:52,278
The people will dance and sing
and some will wear masks.

377
00:38:55,656 --> 00:38:57,533
Why?

378
00:38:58,492 --> 00:39:01,787
Some spirits
linger here too long.

379
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:04,582
They become confused,

380
00:39:04,623 --> 00:39:06,792
mistaking themselves
for the living.

381
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,796
They must be
frightened away.

382
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,509
Santa Muerte.
Santa Muerte.

383
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:18,179
No soporte.
No lo soporte.

384
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:22,558
Santa Muerte.
No soporte.

385
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:02,682
Maybe there is another way.

386
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:13,818
- How... How'd you do that?
- Magic.

387
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:19,073
Blow on it.
Go on.

388
00:40:19,156 --> 00:40:20,992
Like birthday candles.

389
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,877
You have power
just like I do.

390
00:40:33,713 --> 00:40:35,548
You have power over this.

391
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:57,069
That's him!

392
00:40:57,111 --> 00:40:59,947
That's the son of a bitch I dumped
off the pier, I know it.

393
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:02,158
I saw you kill him.

394
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:05,703
Look, you wanna tell yourself
some bullshit fairy tales,
that's your business.

395
00:41:05,745 --> 00:41:09,290
- I'm not gonna sit here with
a fuckin'target on my chest.

396
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:11,375
I'm gonna take
this motherfucker out.

397
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:16,088
You won't stop him
with guns or knives.

398
00:41:18,006 --> 00:41:20,301
He doesn't feel pain.

399
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:27,106
His soul has crossed over.

400
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,652
So how do you stop a man
who's already dead?

401
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:34,280
Can you look Destiny
in the eye...

402
00:41:34,364 --> 00:41:36,449
without flinching?

403
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:40,286
You tell me.

404
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:51,339
The crow
is his source of power;

405
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:55,176
his link between this world
and the next.

406
00:41:55,259 --> 00:42:00,181
Sever that link, and he's
as vulnerable as the next man.

407
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:25,306
You came back.

408
00:42:37,342 --> 00:42:39,553
Were you married?

409
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:43,299
My ring...
It belonged to some friends.

410
00:42:47,127 --> 00:42:49,254
Where are they now?

411
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:51,732
A better place.

412
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:55,444
What about you?

413
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,732
Danny's mother left
after he was born.

414
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:02,902
She was a drug addict.

415
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:09,617
You knocked me out

416
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,787
Bit my lip

417
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:15,164
- You held me down
- What happens to me...

418
00:43:15,248 --> 00:43:17,959
- And kept me sober
- when I finish what
I'm supposed to do here?

419
00:43:20,753 --> 00:43:22,964
Through all this time

420
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:26,092
- You go back.

421
00:43:26,175 --> 00:43:28,594
With no regret

422
00:43:28,678 --> 00:43:32,890
Guess that's just the way
I liked it

423
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,019
- Ooo
- And what if I don't want to go back?

424
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:40,565
- Oh whoa-oa

425
00:43:51,617 --> 00:43:54,954
That tattoo on your chest...
Who gave it to you?

426
00:43:54,996 --> 00:43:58,291
Some bitch down at the Gargoyle.
What's that got to do with anything?

427
00:43:58,332 --> 00:44:01,836
Everything, you idiot!
Find her.

428
00:44:01,878 --> 00:44:05,172
If she gave you his mark,
she's connected to him in some way.

429
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:07,800
She can lead us to him.
Fool!

430
00:44:19,478 --> 00:44:23,065
Mm-aah!
What do you people want?

431
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:27,778
A house in the country.

432
00:44:31,365 --> 00:44:33,201
A little dog.

433
00:44:34,493 --> 00:44:36,370
A wife.

434
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:39,123
Two kids...

435
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:42,835
- and your fucking head
stapled to my pussy seat.

436
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,423
- Listen...

437
00:44:47,506 --> 00:44:49,675
We're only looking for Sarah.

438
00:44:49,717 --> 00:44:51,802
Where is she, Noah?

439
00:44:51,886 --> 00:44:54,096
I ain't gonna tell you that.

440
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:02,355
- I wish I could lose control

441
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:08,444
- But I think you are.
- I wish I could let go

442
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,615
I'm cumming on you

443
00:45:12,698 --> 00:45:14,575
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you

444
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:15,284
Last chance, love.

445
00:45:15,368 --> 00:45:19,163
- Go fuck yourself, you dried-up bitch!

446
00:45:19,205 --> 00:45:22,208
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you

447
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:24,961
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you

448
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:35,498
I took Danny last summer.

449
00:45:35,582 --> 00:45:38,668
We went up on the bike.

450
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:40,712
Rode all the way up the coast.

451
00:45:43,298 --> 00:45:46,175
It was cold, I remember.

452
00:45:46,259 --> 00:45:47,677
We could see our breath.

453
00:45:55,393 --> 00:45:57,228
Look at me.

454
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,488
Ashe?

455
00:46:09,282 --> 00:46:11,159
L-Look at me.

456
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:15,205
No. No.

457
00:46:16,456 --> 00:46:18,333
We can't do this.

458
00:46:21,252 --> 00:46:23,588
I have to find the others.

459
00:46:26,466 --> 00:46:28,801
I have to finish what I started.

460
00:47:31,498 --> 00:47:33,333
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

461
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,752
- Look.
- Who are they?

462
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:37,530
- These people down here?
- Yeah.

463
00:47:37,532 --> 00:47:40,048
That's you and me.

464
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:44,002
Sleep with angels.

465
00:47:47,672 --> 00:47:50,633
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to look.
- It's not your fault.

466
00:47:50,717 --> 00:47:52,886
- Lights!
- Look at me! It's not your fault.
You understand?

467
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:56,181
Action! Action!
Flowers for the dead, sen'or?

468
00:47:56,264 --> 00:47:58,183
- No!

469
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,727
Stop wasting your breath, angelito.

470
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:04,898
Let him get out! Let him alone!
He's just a kid!

471
00:48:04,939 --> 00:48:07,942
- What about the kid?

472
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:11,946
Pain is my power.
Kill them both.

473
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,907
Let him alone!

474
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,743
Let him alone!
He's just a kid!

475
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:19,287
- He doesn't even know who you are.

476
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:23,124
- Don't, please, don't.
- Hush, little baby
Please don't cry

477
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:25,501
I beg you!
I beg you, please!

478
00:48:25,585 --> 00:48:29,923
- Kali's gonna give you
eternal life
- Don't! No! Aah!

479
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:33,301
- No! Aah!

480
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,678
- Nothing personal, sport.

481
00:48:37,263 --> 00:48:42,352
I guess you were just in the wrong
place... at the wrong time. Heh!

482
00:48:51,945 --> 00:48:53,063
Dump 'em!

483
00:48:55,164 --> 00:48:57,864
Farewell , shit heads.

484
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,133
Ah! Hah!

485
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:12,293
Sarah's gone.

486
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,547
Ghost man.

487
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,840
Where is she?

488
00:51:20,902 --> 00:51:23,905
You took my son's life.

489
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:27,576
Some people are
just born victims.

490
00:51:29,077 --> 00:51:31,455
Hush, little baby
Please don't cry

491
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,476
Do you know how to fight?

492
00:51:36,517 --> 00:51:39,020
Do you know how to die?

493
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:44,233
- Yah!

494
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:54,619
- Come on.

495
00:51:57,488 --> 00:51:59,323
Hah!

496
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:12,127
- Hi! Hah!

497
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,561
- Do you want to dance?

498
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,608
- Kali's gonna give you eternal...

499
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,833
Hah! Ah!

500
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,336
- Ah!

501
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,189
Hush, little baby...

502
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,108
Shh.

503
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,988
Don't say a word.

504
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,543
N... No!

505
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:36,337
Daddy's gonna buy you
a big, black bird!

506
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,490
When I first heard the sound

507
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,203
I couldn't put it down

508
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,166
It made my life complete

509
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,085
Ah, give it to me.
Yeah.

510
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,755
Ain't it neat

511
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,135
And you know
I like it when you

512
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,971
- Spit

513
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,310
Oh, I like it when you

514
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,023
Spit

515
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,942
- Naughty boy!

516
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,653
- And when you do that

517
00:54:43,404 --> 00:54:46,116
You know I'm getting wet

518
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,537
- Wear me on your head

519
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,706
Yeah, that's what I said

520
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:58,169
I wanna be
your rock and roll

521
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:02,465
I wanna be
your rock and roll

522
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:07,971
You know I wanna be your
push and pull and it's only 'cause

523
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,269
I like it, whoo

524
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:18,106
Girl, I like it

525
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:21,359
Whoo, girl I like it

526
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,070
- Oh, yeah

527
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,781
Waaahh!

528
00:55:27,837 --> 00:55:30,173
Nothing personal,

529
00:55:30,215 --> 00:55:32,592
sport.

530
00:55:34,176 --> 00:55:35,136
- Hey!

531
00:55:37,055 --> 00:55:38,974
- Look out!

532
00:55:47,065 --> 00:55:48,817
Ow!

533
00:56:20,015 --> 00:56:21,975
Fuck you, bird dick!

534
00:56:23,102 --> 00:56:25,521
Time's up, Curve!

535
00:56:25,604 --> 00:56:27,481
My naked cousin

536
00:56:27,523 --> 00:56:29,525
I see him running

537
00:56:29,608 --> 00:56:31,485
All over his land

538
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:36,323
- Scared as a chick-a-chicken

539
00:56:36,407 --> 00:56:39,493
His naked skin fries

540
00:56:39,535 --> 00:56:42,079
Fries in the sun

541
00:56:42,162 --> 00:56:44,081
But my, my naked cousin

542
00:56:44,164 --> 00:56:47,126
Can cook 'til
he's good, good and done

543
00:56:47,209 --> 00:56:49,086
He's running

544
00:56:52,756 --> 00:56:54,800
He's running

545
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:24,246
He's running

546
00:57:25,914 --> 00:57:28,500
Baby, he's running

547
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:34,256
He's running

548
00:57:38,343 --> 00:57:40,179
He's running

549
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:45,976
He's running

550
00:57:58,897 --> 00:58:00,732
Yeah!

551
00:58:47,262 --> 00:58:49,598
Wrong place.
Wrong time.

552
00:58:52,017 --> 00:58:53,894
Eh, Curve?

553
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,110
Do you think
I'm afraid of you?

554
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:06,448
You fucking freak!
Do you think I'm afraid?

555
00:59:06,532 --> 00:59:09,701
- You think I'm afraid!

556
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,030
Can you hear me, Curve?

557
00:59:50,951 --> 00:59:53,287
You're going to die now.

558
00:59:59,293 --> 01:00:02,546
People used to put coins
in the mouths of the dead.

559
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:05,424
Do you know why?

560
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,222
So they could pay the ferryman
to take them across the river Styx.

561
01:00:20,221 --> 01:00:21,198
What's this?

562
01:00:31,617 --> 01:00:33,869
Open your mouth, Curve.

563
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:15,994
I want to thank you
for showing me my pain, Curve.

564
01:01:17,037 --> 01:01:18,997
You made me what I am.

565
01:01:25,045 --> 01:01:26,922
Flores.

566
01:01:26,964 --> 01:01:29,967
Flores para los muertos.

567
01:01:30,008 --> 01:01:31,885
Flores.

568
01:01:35,347 --> 01:01:37,724
Flores.

569
01:01:37,808 --> 01:01:40,644
Flores para los muertos.

570
01:01:40,727 --> 01:01:42,563
Flores.

571
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:05,589
Where am I?

572
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,011
The tower.

573
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:14,222
Everyone finds
their way here eventually.

574
01:02:20,578 --> 01:02:23,023
What happened to you?

575
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:26,026
Fate happened to her.

576
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:28,987
Sibyl's been cursed
with the gift of prophecy.

577
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,031
Judah Earl.

578
01:02:31,072 --> 01:02:33,033
She sees things
that are fated to happen.

579
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,660
She cut out her eyes
with a carving knife...

580
01:02:35,744 --> 01:02:38,538
because she wanted to make
the visions stop.

581
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:41,249
But that only made the visions
stronger, didn't it, dear?

582
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,652
Why did you bring me here?

583
01:02:43,654 --> 01:02:45,838
I'm glad you asked that, Sarah.

584
01:02:45,879 --> 01:02:49,883
You've got a very important part
to play in this little drama of ours.

585
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:52,594
I intend to capture the crow,

586
01:02:54,054 --> 01:02:55,889
and you, my dear,

587
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:59,101
are the birdseed.

588
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:22,366
Sarah.

589
01:03:46,014 --> 01:03:47,975
First you smiled at no one

590
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:50,394
I found you first

591
01:03:50,477 --> 01:03:52,646
They've grown fine
inside of you

592
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:59,486
But it hurts if I even see you
Make you smile

593
01:03:59,528 --> 01:04:01,864
I look over and cry

594
01:04:03,824 --> 01:04:06,577
But that's too bad
Get stuck for nothing at all

595
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,288
Look at yourself
You ain't no genius

596
01:04:09,329 --> 01:04:11,206
You won't to find
You won't find me

597
01:04:17,379 --> 01:04:19,381
Go!

598
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:23,302
Go!

599
01:04:29,558 --> 01:04:32,060
Look who's come home to roost.

600
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,919
Aah!

601
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,507
But that's too bad

602
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,509
- You'll get what you pay for

603
01:04:48,592 --> 01:04:51,053
Look at yourself
You ain't no genius

604
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,180
You want to find
You won't find me

605
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,849
I'm coming home when I go

606
01:05:00,372 --> 01:05:02,999
Aah

607
01:05:11,842 --> 01:05:14,261
Ashe is here.

608
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:21,268
First you fight me

609
01:05:21,309 --> 01:05:23,895
I found you first

610
01:05:23,979 --> 01:05:27,065
They've grown fine
inside of you

611
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:39,236
- Do you know
what these are called?

612
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,721
Misericords.

613
01:05:41,725 --> 01:05:43,649
Wonderful name,
isn't it?

614
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:50,197
In the Dark Ages, these were
used to deliver the death stroke...

615
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,282
to the mortally wounded.

616
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:55,327
They were considered
tools of mercy.

617
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,150
Easy.

618
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:29,861
Easy.

619
01:06:49,045 --> 01:06:51,589
- Ah!

620
01:07:11,735 --> 01:07:14,070
- Oww!

621
01:07:24,122 --> 01:07:26,791
- Aah!

622
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,509
Ashes, ashes,

623
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:38,012
- Oh!
- We all fall down.

624
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:41,859
No!

625
01:08:48,216 --> 01:08:50,709
You have taken his power.

626
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,587
He is only a man now.

627
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,095
Ah.

628
01:09:10,545 --> 01:09:12,839
Hey, Dad!

629
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:27,363
If you give up now,
we won't be together.

630
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:35,037
Danny!

631
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:49,760
Judah!

632
01:09:58,418 --> 01:10:00,295
What...
What are you?

633
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,131
I'm your shadow, Ashe.

634
01:10:03,173 --> 01:10:05,048
Every angel's got a devil.

635
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:07,636
I've tasted the blood
of the crow and taken your power!

636
01:10:12,224 --> 01:10:17,312
The crows. They are the souls
who have come before Ashe.

637
01:10:17,354 --> 01:10:20,440
They are crying
for the people they have lost.

638
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,151
Now they have come for him.

639
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:27,155
Looks like the dead have
forsaken you, my friend.

640
01:10:27,197 --> 01:10:29,199
- Look at you!
- Go to hell!

641
01:10:29,283 --> 01:10:31,076
Already been there!

642
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:33,829
And I must confess,
I liked what I saw!

643
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:44,464
Where's your strength, huh?
Where's your power?

644
01:10:45,966 --> 01:10:48,135
You're nothing now, Ashe.

645
01:10:48,218 --> 01:10:50,137
Not even a ghost.

646
01:11:13,076 --> 01:11:15,579
- You want death?
- Yeah!

647
01:11:15,662 --> 01:11:18,165
There he is, people!
Take a good look!

648
01:11:37,434 --> 01:11:40,729
Uh! If you whip him,
does he not bleed?

649
01:11:57,195 --> 01:12:00,490
- Ashe!

650
01:12:02,742 --> 01:12:06,287
Aah!

651
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,842
Sarah.

652
01:12:23,263 --> 01:12:25,265
Sarah! Sarah!

653
01:12:25,306 --> 01:12:27,225
Judah!

654
01:12:55,712 --> 01:12:58,047
Aah!

655
01:12:58,131 --> 01:13:00,174
Oh!

656
01:13:11,561 --> 01:13:14,105
You can't stop me
anymore, Ashe.

657
01:13:14,732 --> 01:13:16,775
You haven't got the power.

658
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:19,862
There's nothing
but pain for you now.

659
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,824
Pain is my power.

660
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:37,254
Take him!

661
01:13:40,633 --> 01:13:42,551
Aah!

662
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:25,761
You can't die.

663
01:14:34,478 --> 01:14:36,313
Oh, God.

664
01:15:52,413 --> 01:15:56,876
I believe there's a place
where the restless souls wander...

665
01:15:56,959 --> 01:15:59,587
burdened by the weight
of their own sadness.

666
01:15:59,671 --> 01:16:03,091
They wait for a chance
to set the wrong things right.

667
01:16:03,174 --> 01:16:06,761
Only then can they be reunited
with the ones they love.

668
01:16:06,803 --> 01:16:11,099
Sometimes a crow
shows them the way...

669
01:16:11,182 --> 01:16:15,311
because sometimes
love is stronger than death.
