1
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,915
<i>Welcome back, SG-9.
Stay in the gate room.</i>

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,958
<i>General Landry will be down
for a short debrief.</i>

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
So, after 10 years
and about 1,000 e-mail requests,

4
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,593
I finally get my own parking spot.

5
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,238
Two days after...

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,269
Sir.

7
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,595
Sir.

8
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,431
- Major Davis.
- Morning.

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,870
- Good morning, Colonels.
- Major.

10
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,920
Dial it up, Chief. They're right on schedule.

11
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,558
- What am I signing this time?
- Nothing, sir, just wanted your autograph.

12
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,789
<i>Chevron one encoded.</i>

13
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,519
Sure you don't want to come along, sir?
Might never be another one of these.

14
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,354
Tempting as it is, I'll be doing paperwork
the whole time you're gone.

15
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,513
Besides, one general
looking over your shoulders is plenty.

16
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,636
Yes, speaking of Jack...

17
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,633
He went ahead with SG-3
to officially hand over the prisoner.

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,392
Well, I guess he knows
who we're dealing with.

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,471
Such precautions are unnecessary.

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,313
Half of the free Jaffa fleet stands guard
over the Tok'ra homeworld

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,517
to ensure that the execution of Ba'al
takes place as planned.

22
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,275
You know better than anyone, muscles,
this is an extraction, not an execution.

23
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,032
<i>Chevron three encoded.</i>

24
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,029
Oh, well, this is just in case.

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,830
No. No, no. Airman, you're not walking
into my first extraction ceremony

26
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,069
carrying that thing.

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,869
- Whoa, wait a minute. This is your first?
- Yeah, it should be interesting.

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,475
- It'll blow your mind.
- It is pretty incredible.

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,677
Well, witnessing a Goa'uld
being extracted from a host is one thing.

30
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,036
Actually experiencing it is something else.

31
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,633
<i>Chevron five encoded.</i>

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,872
To feel the sensation of the symbiote
that has controlled your every action

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,599
for so many years,
while you watched helplessly

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,148
from the darkest recess of your mind,

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,314
as it is finally excised from your body
and left to writhe in the light of day...

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,152
<i>Chevron six encoded.</i>

37
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,469
Well, that is incredible.

38
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,278
<i>Chevron seven locked!</i>

39
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,596
- Go to it, SG-1.
- Okay, this I gotta see.

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,397
I'll leave the light on.

41
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,669
Never in the history of boredom

42
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,514
has anyone been more bored
than I am right now.

43
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,799
- Come on, sir, it's only been... Whoa.
- It's almost over.

44
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,710
The crimes they're listing
are starting to sound familiar.

45
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,392
Crimes?

46
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,358
That's what they've been crooning about
for the last three hours?

47
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,509
Quite the ditty, ain't it?

48
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,034
It's not at all fair to the host,
anyway.

49
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,910
Vala, you don't really think
there's any hope for the...

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,594
I mean, you were host to Qetesh
for a relatively short period of time.

51
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,432
Ba'al's been inhabiting this guy
for over 2,000 years.

52
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,272
Revive the prisoner.

53
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,790
- Watch him try and make a run for it.
- Well, with all this security,

54
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,872
I really don't think
he's going to get very far.

55
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,475
Vala?

56
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,470
The prisoner will step forward.

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,157
Ba'al, last of the Goa'uld System Lords,

58
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,794
murderer of untold millions,

59
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,435
these will be your last words.

60
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,035
Speak.

61
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,234
I have nothing to say to the Tok'ra.

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,356
SG-1 and General Jack O'Neill.

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,479
Well, well.

64
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,156
- How's tricks, B?
- I've been better, I'm afraid. And you?

65
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,193
- Not so bad, actually. Quite good.
- How nice for you.

66
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,319
- How about those last words?
- As you wish.

67
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,794
Teal'c...

68
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,355
I will always regret
that you never became my First Prime.

69
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,113
- And where is my dear Qetesh?
- Well, Vala was here.

70
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,990
- Interesting.
- Oh, she's probably gone to the bathroom,

71
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,993
for heaven's sake.
I'm next in line, by the way.

72
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,197
- Can we get on with this?
- There is one more thing.

73
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,311
You've all made a terrible mistake.

74
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,593
- Yes, that is what they all say.
- There can be no doubt of your crimes.

75
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,468
What I mean to say is, I'm not the last
of the Goa'uld System Lords,

76
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,472
though I do admit,
I may be last of the clones.

77
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,996
There were so many of us.
It is difficult to be certain.

78
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,313
Mitchell?

79
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,551
We tracked them all, sir.
This one is the last one.

80
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,594
You sure?

81
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,992
That is, after all, why we've come,
why we had to endure all that singing.

82
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,917
Get rid of the last bad guy,
and then there's cake.

83
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,435
Carter?

84
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,476
Well, as you know,
in order to track his clones,

85
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,758
Ba'al gave each of them a tracking device
detectable from anywhere in the galaxy.

86
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,239
Now, he also placed one in himself,

87
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,673
so we wouldn't be able
to tell the difference

88
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,239
between a clone and the original.

89
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,073
And because he was the original,
he was the only one of us

90
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,391
who possessed a tracking device
that could be removed.

91
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,119
So, you see,
the last of the Goa'uld System Lords,

92
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,239
the last of my dear brothers
is still out there,

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,709
and since as of this moment
he knows he's the last,

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,191
- he has very special plans for you.
- "Plans," you say.

95
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,635
A recently completed failsafe device

96
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,033
should an unfortunate circumstance,
such as my imminent death, arise.

97
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,113
It was you who gave us the idea, actually.

98
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,911
I suspect it has already been put
into action.

99
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,434
He lies.

100
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,158
He does that, you know.

101
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,993
We shall see.

102
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,279
It is time.

103
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,359
This is going to be cool.

104
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,149
Make your course
three-five-zero.

105
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,390
Three-five-zero. Aye, Captain.

106
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,869
We'd be in Boston by now

107
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,758
if we weren't zigzagging
all over the bloody Atlantic.

108
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,638
You'd rather make it easy for the U-boats?

109
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,517
We're not at war yet.

110
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,388
Besides, we're riding too high in the water
for a U-boat captain to waste a torpedo.

111
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,916
Check to see the cargo's secure.

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,719
You're never going to tell me
what it is, are you?

113
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,438
If I knew myself...

114
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,072
That's no torpedo.

115
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,438
What is it, Captain?

116
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,635
<i>Emergency stations! All hands!</i>

117
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,355
- Maintain your heading, son.
- Aye, sir.

118
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,317
I'm gonna check for damage.

119
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,713
Secure the ship.
Make ready the Chappa'ai.

120
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,357
Take your time, Jaffa.

121
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,794
We have all the time in the world.

122
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,996
Begin the extraction process.

123
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,314
Seriously, did anybody see
where Vala went?

124
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,994
Maybe extractions bring up
too many bad memories.

125
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,914
Hey, have you ever tried
to find a bathroom in a pyramid?

126
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,958
She cannot have gone far, O'Neill.
There are...

127
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,316
- Carter?
- I don't know, sir. He wasn't beamed out.

128
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,198
- It's like he was there one second, and...
- The next he was gone, just like Vala.

129
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,872
I think we'd better get the hell out of here.

130
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,477
Everyone, remain calm!

131
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,875
What have you done with my people?

132
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,595
Sir!

133
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,474
Jack.

134
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,913
Go to the gate.

135
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,679
- Not without you.
- Go.

136
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,554
All right, you heard the man. Let's go.

137
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,469
Carter!

138
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,152
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

139
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,756
The vessel is secure, my lord.

140
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,078
Dial the Chappa'ai.

141
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,869
Jackson!

142
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,475
Move!

143
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,598
Okay, not Earth.

144
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,033
- I dialed Earth.
- Yeah, I know,

145
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,872
like I've seen you do
a hundred times before,

146
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,111
but my keen professional eye
is seeing a few differences

147
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,634
between this place
and Stargate Command.

148
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,158
That, for one, and...
The stargate is in a box.

149
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,391
Carter, what's going on?

150
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,515
Sam?

151
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,633
I don't know.

152
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,191
Look, I know what happened back there,
but we need you in the here and now.

153
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,396
Wherever or whenever that is.

154
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,233
Right. Right.

155
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,829
Okay.

156
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,270
Looks like the active gate
warmed things up for a bit.

157
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,075
Warmed things up?

158
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,038
Yeah, because the temperature's
falling again.

159
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,633
It's just gone past minus 20.

160
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,757
Okay, that's chilly.
Let's not just stand around.

161
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,274
I don't see anything that could be a DHD.

162
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,793
This has to be connected
to what was happening

163
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,791
on the Tok'ra homeworld.

164
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,350
All right, so Vala and Teal'c
disappear into thin air,

165
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,750
we gate into somebody's freezer,

166
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,116
put the pieces
of that puzzle together, and...

167
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,073
I got nothing. You?

168
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,118
Well, there is almost no EM of any kind
from any direction

169
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,431
to help us determine our location.

170
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,198
Mayday. Mayday.

171
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,830
This is Colonel Cameron Mitchell.
Do you hear me? Please respond.

172
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,148
Mayday. Mayday.

173
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,993
I don't think anybody's going to hear you.

174
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,479
- We're in the cargo hold of a ship.
What?

175
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,872
Not just any ship.

176
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,360
<i>- This is the Achilles.
- That name's familiar.</i>

177
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,839
Yeah, because it was the ship
that brought the stargate

178
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,480
from Africa to America
before the outbreak of World War II.

179
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,073
No, that's not why.

180
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,799
See, at the time, they thought the stargate
might be a weapon of some kind,

181
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,438
so they wanted to keep it
out of the hands of the Nazis.

182
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,589
Do you realize what this means?

183
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,035
Guys, I hate to interrupt,
but the temperature's falling.

184
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,872
We just passed minus 40.

185
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,633
- Celsius or Fahrenheit?
- At that temperature, they're the same.

186
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,517
Really? Didn't know that.

187
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,068
We've got about three minutes
before frostbite sets in.

188
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,276
Hypothermia, five minutes after that.

189
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,715
I'm already starting
to lose the feeling in my fingers.

190
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,030
All right, break out the camp stove
from the emergency pack.

191
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,839
Oh, you mean the one
that was with Teal'c?

192
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,715
We can't light a fire in here.
There's nowhere to vent the smoke.

193
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,313
Cover your ears.

194
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,919
You realize that's not going to
do much.

195
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,592
I'm not done yet.

196
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,996
If you don't blow a hole in the ice
with that, the entire blast is going

197
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,877
to come flying back
into this compartment.

198
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,112
Or worse, what if that ice
is holding back seawater?

199
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,193
Yeah, I admit, there's a few problems
with this idea.

200
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,235
Carter, how cold is it?

201
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,389
Uh...

202
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,514
Minus 43.

203
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,995
Fire in the hole.

204
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,552
Well, it's warmer.

205
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,958
Yeah, I'm seeing stars.
Let's get this fire started.

206
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,474
What was that?

207
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,677
Okay, the explosion must've
dislodged the ship from the ice.

208
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,910
Don't tell me. We're sinking.

209
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,640
- Well, we had to leave sooner or later!
- Foul-weather gear.

210
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,518
There's got to be some
around here somewhere.

211
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,391
Hey, we've got water coming in over here!

212
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,277
Hey, I've got something!

213
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,070
Jackson, try this on for size!

214
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,349
Carter!

215
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,832
Hey, we've got to go!

216
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,869
Jackson!

217
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,754
Jackson!

218
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,998
The ship was warmer.

219
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,470
- You want to go back?
- No, I'm good.

220
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,394
All right. So, which way?

221
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,553
Well, we're above the Arctic Circle,
so does it really matter?

222
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,029
- South it is.
- Daniel!

223
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,115
I know.

224
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,634
Back on the ship,
my foot went through the deck

225
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,075
where water was coming in.

226
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,550
It froze the laces on my boots.
I couldn't get it off.

227
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,794
Jackson, what did you want to go
and do that for?

228
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,518
Look, we'll just have to help you walk.

229
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,279
No, I can't feel a thing below my knee.

230
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,635
I don't think I'm going anywhere.

231
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,430
Look, I'm being selfish, here.

232
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,156
Our only chance is for you guys to get
within radio range of some kind of help.

233
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,789
The sooner you go,
the sooner you can send help back for me.

234
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,792
Go, don't waste time!

235
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,077
Once that sun rises,
it's going to warm right up.

236
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,434
Jackson.

237
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,348
Daniel.

238
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,595
Bye.

239
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,599
Oh, shit!

240
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,915
I keep wondering
what Daniel was going to say.

241
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,991
When?
- Back at the ship, he got all excited

242
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,275
when he said,
"Do you realize what this means?"

243
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,157
Well, obviously, that Ba'al
had gone back in time

244
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,912
and stopped the ship
that was carrying the stargate

245
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,718
from ever reaching the United States.

246
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,951
By sending it to the North Pole.
Yeah, apparently.

247
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,118
Carter, that is a terrible plan.

248
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,272
Yeah, but you have no problem
with the fact that he went back in time?

249
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,635
All I'm saying is,
why not just sink the damn boat?

250
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,872
I think the bigger point here
is that Ba'al has rewritten history.

251
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,236
Teal'c and Vala just disappeared
because they never joined SG-1.

252
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,436
The stargate program never happened.

253
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,750
In which case,
I would have never crashed in my F-302,

254
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,593
which means I wouldn't have
a titanium pin in my leg, killing me,

255
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,591
- which it is, right now.
- You're right.

256
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,955
- You're right, it's a paradox.
- Thank you.

257
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,998
Or maybe because we were in transit
through the stargate

258
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,514
when the timeline shifted.

259
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,512
Well, Ba'al never would've intended
that gate to wind up anywhere

260
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,670
but the bottom of the ocean.
Something went wrong,

261
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,399
and we were not supposed
to make it back to Earth alive.

262
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,118
That's his first mistake.

263
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,430
Maybe he's already taken over
the entire planet.

264
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,476
I mean, humanity could be enslaved,
for all we know.

265
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,835
That's quitter talk.
All we got to do is stay alive

266
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,354
until you figure a way to undo this.

267
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,911
- Undo this?
- You heard me.

268
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,072
Mayday. Mayday!

269
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,913
This is Colonel Cameron Mitchell. Mayday!

270
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,029
Mayday!

271
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,068
Sam, we have to keep moving.

272
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,513
Why?

273
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,991
If we're going to freeze to death,
here's as good a spot as any, isn't it?

274
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,115
Uh...

275
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,113
I don't like this spot.

276
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,116
Cam, come on. What is the point?
There's no one around for hundreds of...

277
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,639
What is that?

278
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,509
Hey!

279
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,671
- Which one of you is Mitchell?
- That'd be me.

280
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,231
- Jack O'Neill, Special Forces.
- Oh, my God!

281
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,551
We thought you were dead.

282
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,071
Well, back at you, ma'am.

283
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,718
- Do you recognize her?
- Sure do.

284
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,475
Sir, we've got to go back for Daniel.

285
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,393
What we have to do
is get you people off this ice.

286
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,038
- Major Wood!
- Yes, sir!

287
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,192
I marked the "X" and dropped the buoy.
It should be along any minute, sir.

288
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,159
Mitchell, I don't know what you're doing
in the Arctic with a dead astronaut,

289
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,674
but I'm going to need some answers.

290
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,794
Yeah, well, back at you.

291
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,350
What are we looking for?

292
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,749
There! Your ride!

293
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,032
Colonel O'Neill!

294
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,078
- Permission to come aboard!
- Permission granted, sir.

295
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,230
The C.O. Would like you to make it snappy.

296
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,073
Sonar picked up
a Russian sub nosing around.

297
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,908
Let's go.

298
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,237
- Down scope.
- Aye, sir.

299
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,235
<i>- Colonel, welcome aboard the Alexandria.
- Captain, thanks for the ride.</i>

300
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,231
We're always happy to help the Air Force.

301
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,117
Chief of the boat,
escort our guests to the ward room.

302
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,317
Escort our guests to the ward room.
Aye, Captain.

303
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,679
- Colonel, isn't that...
- If it isn't, it's her twin sister.

304
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,149
I'm going to need a couple minutes
to debrief those two.

305
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,958
You mean those three.

306
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,709
What?

307
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,472
Officer of the deck,
prepare to stationary dive.

308
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,950
- I intend to take her down immediately.
- Prepare to stationary dive. Aye, Captain.

309
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,076
Stationary dive, stationary dive.

310
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,356
- Jackson!
- Hey!

311
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,396
- Daniel.
- Hi!

312
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,959
I didn't think you guys
were going to make it.

313
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,473
Us? What about you?

314
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,156
Oh, no, the sub actually came up
about a half hour after you guys left.

315
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,037
<i>It must have heard
the Achilles going down.</i>

316
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,795
Scared the hell out of me, too.
I thought I was hallucinating.

317
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,433
In fact, I still am afraid I might be.

318
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,832
See, they pumped me up
with something, and...

319
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,512
No, it's...

320
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,636
- It's all real.
- Oh.

321
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,191
- How bad is the leg?
- Oh, they say I'm probably going to lose it.

322
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,795
Hey, you know, I thought I was dead.

323
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,953
I guess in the grand scheme of things,
I can't really complain that much.

324
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,633
Excuse us.

325
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,595
Jack?

326
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,031
Are there any more of you
I should know about?

327
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,352
No. Look, I understand how weird this is...

328
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,351
About four hours ago, one of our satellites

329
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,910
took the damnedest picture
you ever did see.

330
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,275
How did you get here so fast?

331
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,597
I was already on my way up here
to supervise a training exercise on the ice,

332
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,708
and then I got orders to make a drop
to determine what caused this.

333
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,790
Whatever that was is gone.

334
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,310
- And you have no idea what this is?
- You're the astronaut, you tell me.

335
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,994
The device that made
what you see in this picture,

336
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,389
an energy vortex created
prior to the establishment

337
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,517
of a stable wormhole, is called a stargate.

338
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,989
Now, normally, we use it
to travel to other planets,

339
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,516
but this time we came through it
from an alternate timeline,

340
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,913
one where, amongst other things,
I'm not an astronaut.

341
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,830
Yeah, that's pretty much
how I had it figured.

342
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,275
Actually, she's telling the truth.

343
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,913
And who are you?

344
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,679
Daniel Jackson.

345
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,391
In the timeline where we come from,

346
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,234
we've actually traveled
to several hundred planets together.

347
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,153
- "We," as in you and...
- Yeah, in fact, in our timeline,

348
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,596
I'm the closest thing you have
to a best friend.

349
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,069
Yeah. Yeah, I'd buy that.

350
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,358
- Okay, you're from Minnesota.
- Yeah.

351
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,670
Eleven years ago,
your son accidentally shot himself

352
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,512
with a loaded 9mm
he found in your closet...

353
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,718
All right. Stop it, right there.
My kid is fine.

354
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,268
He's at home, and he's fine!
What the hell's wrong with you?

355
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,069
Obviously, some things are different
in this timeline,

356
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,833
- but what you have to understand is...
- No, I don't!

357
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,391
I don't have to understand anything!
More importantly, I don't want to.

358
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,833
As far as I'm concerned,
you people are nothing

359
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,115
but a pile of paperwork waiting to happen.

360
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,430
- Jack, please...
- And stop that!

361
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,675
Jeez.

362
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,912
You should at least warn your superiors
that this planet is in great danger.

363
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,797
I'll get right on that.

364
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,080
All right, they can have access
to food, water,

365
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,469
and any medical attention
they might need,

366
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,711
but they cannot go past this door
except to use the head.

367
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,156
And nobody comes in or out
until we can surface, and

368
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,279
- deal with these freaks.
- Aye, sir.

369
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,670
<i>Samantha Carter?
- Yes.</i>

370
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,910
It's common knowledge
that four years ago

371
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,958
<i>a computer failure forced
the space shuttle Intrepid's main engines</i>

372
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,076
to shut down
before it could reach a safe orbit

373
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,071
or a secondary landing site.

374
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,559
When the autopilot also failed,

375
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,473
Mission Commander Samantha Carter
stayed behind to fly it,

376
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,949
while her crew bailed out
of the escape hatch.

377
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,191
The orbiter went down over the Atlantic,
and her body was never recovered.

378
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,236
- It wasn't me.
- You just said your name...

379
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,515
- I was recruited into the Stargate...
- Stargate Command is a branch...

380
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,556
...not NASA.
... of the United States Air Force.

381
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,552
Founded in 1990-something,
I forget the exact year,

382
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,676
for the purposes of exploration and...

383
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,275
Actually, it was less an altered timeline
than it was this kind of multiverse thing...

384
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,713
It operates in secret
from a facility...

385
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,075
- I know what you're thinking, and...
- So we had the stargate powered...

386
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,879
...you're thinking I'm insane.
... and it was capable of operating, but

387
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,359
none of the random addresses we tried...

388
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,635
A list?
You want the whole list of every planet...

389
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,948
...and that's when I realized
- And so...

390
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,678
that the symbols
were actually constellations,

391
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,318
- and it was just a matter of determining...
- Okay. Earth.

392
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,197
...which of the 39 symbols...
- You never forget your first.

393
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,077
...represented the point of origin.
- And we discovered that

394
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,674
the symbols in a combination of seven
represented a gate address...

395
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,909
...known as Kassa,
it's kind of like space corn,

396
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,195
but, you know, that is a story
you are going to want to hear sometime.

397
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,635
- Why do you think this is funny?
- It was just a matter of figuring out...

398
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,109
- Everything I can think of, I have told you.
- Because it is funny,

399
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,236
and you need to learn that things
can be both funny and true.

400
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,197
Whereas I've been trying
to tell you Earth is in serious danger,

401
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,113
- you don't seem to give a rat's ass!
- Seriously, who would make this shit up?

402
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,875
Okay, fine! You say O'Neill wants nothing
to do with us? What about Landry?

403
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,996
If you would like to hear the answer
to that question,

404
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,513
- why don't you go ahead
- I know him...

405
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,794
- and play your tape back?
- Oh, my God,

406
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,677
- for the umpteenth time...
- I'm gonna take a break.

407
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,990
I want to talk to somebody else.

408
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,634
I am agitated, because this is not the way

409
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,517
things are supposed to be.

410
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,198
- Unfortunately, Colonel, it's the way it is.
- General, thank you for coming.

411
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,748
You flew F-4s in Vietnam.
You have a daughter named Caroline.

412
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,751
You're wild
about Fulvous Whistling-Ducks.

413
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,950
Stop right there, son. I believe you.

414
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,949
You do?

415
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,474
I've been listening to all three of you
for quite a while now.

416
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,870
It's a hell of a story. The fact is...

417
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,470
Are the other two already in the hangar?
Good, we'll be right there.

418
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,553
I can't stand having to repeat myself.
Follow me.

419
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,840
Yeah, see, I knew that about him, too.

420
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,471
- Hey, you guys. Having fun?
- Oh, joy.

421
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,075
You've been at this for five straight days.
Eat something.

422
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,269
It's not like you didn't feed us.

423
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,518
Fine, I don't like to eat alone.
You should know that.

424
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,556
Sir, you're probably wondering
why I requested

425
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,790
that you be brought all this way up
to meet with us.

426
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,393
Actually, you all did.

427
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,516
Something about the fact
that I'm the sort of man

428
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,318
who would understand.

429
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,520
You'll have to forgive me.
I was at your memorial service

430
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,716
on the front lawn of the White House.

431
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,351
I imagine you're an extraordinary person
in whatever timeline you happen to be in.

432
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,553
- Sir, if you don't mind my asking...
- You don't exist.

433
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,438
That is to say, there's no record
of a Colonel Cameron Mitchell

434
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,670
fitting your description
currently in the U.S. Air Force,

435
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,637
or anywhere else, for that matter.

436
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,598
And you, Dr. Jackson,
were last seen in Egypt,

437
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,353
attempting to find proof
that aliens once visited Earth

438
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,353
and that the pyramids are landing pads
for their spaceships.

439
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,278
I take it that in your timeline,
that you're not a discredited whack-job

440
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,511
- living on the fringes of society.
- That really depends on who you ask.

441
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,397
General, not that I need
to make this all about me...

442
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,072
There was one Mitchell of note

443
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,436
who served in the Merchant Marine
in the late '30s.

444
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,071
<i>The captain of the ocean freighter Achilles.
That's how I know the name.</i>

445
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,709
Grandma had a picture of him
standing beside his ship in Boston Harbor.

446
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,234
It's the one in my locker right now.

447
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,277
Ba'al must've killed the crew
when he gated aboard.

448
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,669
Wow.

449
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,194
You're literally a grandfather paradox.

450
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,157
That's what Dr. Lee said.

451
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,357
Sir, I realize
that it may be extremely difficult,

452
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,750
if not impossible, to recover the stargate
from the bottom of the Arctic Ocean,

453
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,593
- but there is another one...
- The one in Antarctica, you mean?

454
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,148
I'm told we're sending a team
to check it out.

455
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,676
We need to do more than check it out, sir.
We need to use it.

456
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,193
We have to set things right.

457
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,350
- How, exactly?
- I've been thinking about this.

458
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,750
Now, Ba'al must have built
some sort of temporal device.

459
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,478
- Time machine.
- Yes.

460
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,199
Now, if we could use the stargate
to contact one of our allies, then we...

461
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,236
That will not be allowed to happen.

462
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,356
Sir, I don't think you understand
exactly what will be lost

463
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,000
if we're not allowed to return things
to the way they're supposed to be.

464
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,789
"Supposed to be" is relative, Dr. Jackson.

465
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,474
The allies we've met,
the technologies we've acquired,

466
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,152
the hundreds of planets we've visited...

467
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,719
We can do all that,

468
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,837
assuming we can recover the stargate
in Antarctica,

469
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,275
and assuming it does
what you say it does.

470
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,477
I'm sure we'll use the thing to go out
and explore the galaxy.

471
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,028
There are a lot of excited people
around here.

472
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,918
With respect, sir, you're missing the point.

473
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,992
The timeline was altered
by one of our enemies.

474
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,719
The System Lord, Ba'al.
You talked about him at some length.

475
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,075
Because he's a very real threat.

476
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,434
According to your own story,

477
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,354
it's been 70 years
since the timeline was changed.

478
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,752
If all this is part of some plan,
where is he?

479
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,433
Man has a point.

480
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,317
Okay, if his plan was to take over Earth,

481
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,994
he would first have to reestablish a
power base with the other System Lords.

482
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,513
Now, that wouldn't be easy.

483
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,192
Now, if his plan died with him, then...

484
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,431
Or he's still in the process
of establishing his power,

485
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,748
and it's just a matter of time.

486
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,558
This is as far as we're willing to go.

487
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,234
In exchange for signing
a non-disclosure agreement,

488
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,276
you'll be given identities,

489
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,751
a place to live in different parts
of the country, for obvious reasons.

490
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,354
And you better behave yourself in public,

491
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,830
<i>otherwise you'll end up on the front page
of The Enquirer.</i>

492
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,955
Sir, please don't do this.

493
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,508
The decision has been made
at the highest level.

494
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,592
I'm sure that, in time,
your advice will be welcome.

495
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,240
If and when the Navy
gets this stargate up and running,

496
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,151
you can come aboard as consultants,

497
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,869
but you will never, ever, be allowed
to step through that thing.

498
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,269
You're afraid we're going
to try and repair the timeline.

499
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,157
Oh, you've made that intention
abundantly clear...

500
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,074
- Because we have a responsibility.
- But you don't have the right!

501
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,476
If you were to succeed,

502
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,030
events in the lives of thousands,
if not millions of people,

503
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,348
would never have happened!

504
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,793
My goodness, people,

505
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,078
the arrogance of what you're asking us
to help you do is mind-boggling!

506
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,674
Maybe if I wasn't woken
in the middle of the night

507
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,909
and flown to Alaska,

508
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,992
I might be more like the kind,
sympathetic former general

509
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,234
you were hoping I'd be,
but trust me, if you lived in this timeline...

510
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,709
We'd want it to stay the way it is.

511
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,236
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to go back to my wife

512
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,880
and my very pleasant retirement.

513
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,679
And you all have new lives to begin.

514
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,194
They're ready to board the aircraft!

515
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,394
It was a pleasure meeting all of you.

516
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,589
Yeah.

517
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,079
It truly was.

518
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,515
At no time are you to make contact
by any means

519
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,149
with Mr. Jackson or Ms. Carter
without prior authorization.

520
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,674
Any such attempt will be seen
as a breach of this agreement,

521
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,273
and you will be remanded in custody...

522
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,148
You will be provided a suitable
home, vehicle, and a living allowance,

523
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,676
which may be augmented without penalty
should you choose to seek employment

524
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,115
in any field other than the following:

525
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,751
<i>- Astrophysics, aerospace, engineering...
At no time may you discuss, write,</i>

526
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,513
<i>or otherwise communicate the matters
and/ or events</i>

527
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,192
<i>as stated in this agreement</i>

528
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,192
<i>with any person
other than your authorized contact.</i>

529
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,271
<i>Is that clear, Dr. Jackson?</i>

530
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,993
Dr. Jackson?

531
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,233
Yeah, I'm sorry.

532
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,472
This is the place.

533
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,353
I guess it is.

534
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,833
- Do you need help getting out?
- No, I think I can handle it.

535
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,313
Keep the change.

536
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,188
How's it going, Cam?

537
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,070
Hey, Mrs... Heather. Heather.
Caught myself this time.

538
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,152
- Finally.
- Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

539
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,959
So, when do we get to go for a ride?

540
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,156
Well, I'm going to take it
for a road-trip test drive,

541
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,754
so maybe when I get back.

542
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,270
I'll hold you to that. Come on.

543
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,271
Oh, damn, that's trouble.

544
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,957
Can I help you, son?

545
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,874
Oh... I apologize for the intrusion.

546
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,316
I spent some time here when I was a kid.

547
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,072
What's the name?

548
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,913
Mitchell. Cam Mitchell.

549
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,630
I've lived here over 35 years.

550
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,430
- Really? Who was here before that?
- Hendersons.

551
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,438
Harry and Lorna.

552
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,275
Oh, so you knew Harry?

553
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,549
Yeah.

554
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,598
I was just a boy,
but they were nice people.

555
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,595
Look, I know this is weird,
but do you mind if I go inside?

556
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,434
I have an image of the place
that I can't quite shake.

557
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,715
Well, what the hell,
I'm not doing anything.

558
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,949
Come on.

559
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,232
Hello, Dr. Jackson?

560
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,592
Yes, I'm sorry I'm calling so late.
I'm calling from the States, and...

561
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,917
Well, I've stayed in that hotel myself
a number of times,

562
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,468
and I just thought that you might...

563
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,753
Well, because I wanted
to tell you something.

564
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,592
That you're right.

565
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,034
About everything, about the pyramids,

566
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,918
about what the glyphs said
about aliens visiting Earth.

567
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,353
Everything.

568
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,590
It doesn't matter who I am.

569
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,830
Let's just say I'm someone
who believes in your work,

570
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,592
and you should, too.

571
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,794
No, no, no, I do. I really do. I...

572
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,077
You have to have more faith
in yourself, Dr. Jackson.

573
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,155
Hello?

574
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,594
Hello?

575
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,719
Put me through
to your commanding officer.

576
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,950
Tell him it's Colonel Carter.
I need to speak to him now.

577
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,349
Mr. Mitchell?

578

<i>This stunning footage

Sam!

593
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,878
This is so great.
I was just thinking about you guys.

594

I thought by now they'd at least allow us
to see each other,

Yes, it is. But generations from now,

they will speak of Master Teal'c of Chulak,

That's actually rather good, isn't it?

609

Did you plan to say that
when you walked in?

610

have reported.</i>

615
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,679
<i>It is as you promised.</i>

616
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,719
<i>They number in the billions,
and they are defenseless.</i>

617
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,869
Excellent.

618
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,269
You may reveal the coordinates
to the rest of the fleet.

619
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,032
We shall leave on my order.

620
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,473
<i>As you wish.</i>

621
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,199
There is a god standing here
with wet hands.

622
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,314
Teal'c, you may tell your warriors

623
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,313
that their dream of freedom
is one step closer.

624
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,913
I shall, my lord.

625
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,712
- Well?
- I am in awe of your accomplishment.

626
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,518
You have predicted every move
of your enemies

627
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,592
and fulfilled every promise to your allies.

628
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:14,028
Ra, Nirrti, Cronus, Zipacna,
all once-powerful System Lords, and now,

629
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,599
they all serve you.

630
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,557
They serve us, my queen.

631
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,633
- I am truly privileged.
- I know.

632
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,318
I can't help myself.

633
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,113
<i>There is no nation on this earth</i>

634
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,039
<i>that does not share in our resolve
to defend our world.</i>

635
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,758
Until we give them something more
to talk about,

636
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,478
they're going to play this speech to death.

637
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,552
What about the Russians or the Chinese?
Are they hearing anything?

638
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,108
There's been no response of any kind
from the alien craft, sir.

639
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,112
We've tried every frequency there is.

640
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,758
Why would they come all the way

641
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,195
from wherever the hell it is
they came from,

642
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,956
fly around with a bunch of F-16s
on their asses for half a day,

643
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,393
and then just sit there?

644
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,040
They're advance scout ships,
Mr. President.

645
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,519
You asked that they be brought
to the command bunker

646
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,079
the moment they arrived, sir.

647
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,310
That's fine, Alex, thank you.

648
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,991
Henry Hayes. Thanks for coming.
You were saying, Mr. Mitchell?

649
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,909
The ships in orbit are called Al'kesh.

650
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,594
They serve both as scouts
and as ground-support bombers.

651
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,671
And they're nothing
compared to what's coming next.

652
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,954
Really?

653
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,315
- So, what's coming next?
- Death.

654
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,594
Slavery.

655
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,556
More slavery, more death.

656
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,794
Look, if you want to say, "I told you so,"
go ahead and get it off your chest,

657
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,793
but then you can do one of two things.
You can help, or you can leave.

658
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,235
- Okay, bye!
- Jackson.

659
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,118
Right, I forgot to say, "I told you so. "

660
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,589
Now, are you going to help, or not?

661
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,832
Have you recovered the stargate?

662
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,309
We couldn't locate the one you sent down,

663
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,234
but we did manage to find the other one
in Antarctica. It's still there.

664
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,514
Why didn't you bring it back?

665
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,673
Well, the Navy suggested, and I agreed,
what better place to build a facility

666
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,355
and start a testing program
in complete secrecy

667
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,953
than McMurdo base?

668
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,359
Why weren't we told?

669
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,439
You'd be surprised
at some of the stuff we do around here

670
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,590
without running it by you.

671
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,432
It isn't operational yet, is it?

672
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,080
Not yet, but we have our best scientists
working on it.

673
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,469
How quickly can you get us there?

674
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,959
Don't forget,
I'm the one who gave the order

675
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,474
to keep you away from that thing.

676
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,636
Erasing the timeline is not an option.

677
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,712
Then why are we here?

678
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,676
When I was first briefed on you three,

679
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,639
I thought my Chief of Staff
was yanking my chain.

680
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,312
I didn't believe him
the second time, either.

681
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,597
Finally, he had to bring in
the National Security Advisor

682
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,274
to convince me that he wasn't kidding.

683
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:49,912
On page 2,000-and-something of the brief,
one of you, I can't remember which,

684
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,959
talks about how I handled
a similar invasion in your timeline

685
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,155
to the one that might happen here.

686
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,277
Of course, in our case, you had the benefit
of an operational Stargate Program

687
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,793
for about seven years.

688
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,996
Well, to be fair, it was actually
the Ancient weapons platform

689
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,798
in Antarctica that saved us.

690
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,029
Exactly.

691
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,710
- Shouldn't it still be there?
- It's under a mile of ice.

692
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,429
The Army Corps of Engineers have been
drilling at the coordinates you gave us

693
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,033
for the last three months.

694
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,954
- We're not there yet, but we're close.
- Even so, its power source is depleted.

695
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,190
We'd need a fully-charged
Zero Point Module.

696
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,349
Taonas.

697
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,839
There's no reason
it still shouldn't be there.

698
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,399
We'd have to steal a cargo ship.

699
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,357
Well, it's not like
we haven't done that before.

700
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,795
Once we recover the ZPM,
we can gate directly back to Earth,

701
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,950
because the stargate's already
in Antarctica.

702
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,075
- We'll just need...
- Someone with a gene

703
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,435
that could operate the chair.

704
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,239
If there's still time, sir, this can work.

705
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,992
That's the SG-1 I read about.

706
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,038
If the control crystal's intact
and the power relay's in position,

707
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,112
I should be able to dial out the gate
in a couple of hours.

708
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,713
General Hammond?

709
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,071
Sir, it's good to see you.

710
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,593
If you say so.

711
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,352
There are four F-15s on the tarmac
at Andrews,

712
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,318
each carrying minimal armaments
and extra fuel tanks.

713
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,958
Once the stargate is operational,

714
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,271
you'll be escorted through
by a squad of four marines.

715
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,952
That's not negotiable.

716
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,234
To keep us on the mission.

717
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,515
That's not necessary, sir,
but we'll take the back-up.

718
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,158
Even if everything goes according to plan,

719
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,151
it's going to be a couple of days, at least,
till we get back.

720
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,674
What are you going to do
if Ba'al shows up before then?

721
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,433
Is there anything we can do, Dr. Jackson?

722
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,871
- Well, I wouldn't mention us.
- Thought of that one.

723
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,279
Good luck.

724
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,752
To all of us, sir.

725
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,071
There it is, my friends.

726
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:59,911
This little world in the middle of nowhere,
lost and forgotten until now.

727
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,558
Thanks to our Lord Ba'al,

728
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,871
it is ours to enslave and pillage
as we please.

729
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,157
It is an abomination they have been
allowed to breed to such numbers.

730
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,310
Their stargate has been buried
for centuries,

731
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,473
and was subsequently involved
in an unfortunate boating accident.

732
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,192
Hence, they have been completely cut off
from us.

733
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,271
They know nothing of the Goa'uld.

734
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,999
Nevertheless, they are far too many
to control.

735
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,911
We'll just blast them
to the brink of extinction.

736
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,991
That will not be necessary.

737
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,958
- But it would be enjoyable.
- I agree.

738
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,600
You are all so stuck in your ways.

739
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,272
If we were to wipe them out
by the billions,

740
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,955
the survivors would despise us
for all eternity.

741
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,874
I know something of these people.
I have studied them for some time.

742
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,397
If we give them cause to fight,
they will fight to the bitter end,

743
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,790
but if we promise them a grand future,

744
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,555
if we offer them our loving kindness,

745
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,599
then I assure you, my friends,
they'll fall for it completely.

746
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,955
As you have done with your Jaffa?

747
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,718
If by that you mean the Jaffa who,
with the promise of freedom,

748
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,588
managed to defeat the combined armies
of the System Lords,

749
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,749
yes.

750
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,150
And that promise will be fulfilled.

751
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,798
I'm sure it will.

752
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,514
In fact...

753
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,839
- Teal'c.
- Yes, my lord.

754
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,516
Camulus has kindly offered
one half of his domain, Australia,

755
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,113
to the free Jaffa nation.

756
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:31,274
- I have said no such...
- Your generosity brings a god to tears.

757
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,389
Now, let us be clear, my friends.

758
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,833
The lands of the Tau'ri that you receive

759
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,309
and the many millions of humans
that inhabit them

760
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,719
are a gift.

761
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,553
Be grateful,

762
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,719
or be silent.

763
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,513
Return to your ships.
I shall contact the Tau'ri myself.

764
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,238
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

765
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,271
- Teal'c.
- Yes, my lord.

766
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,638
There is something
I want you to search for.

767
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,428
Ships, sir. Dozens of them.

768
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,398
They just popped up out of nowhere
a few minutes ago.

769
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,839
Hyperspace.

770
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,198
I read the brief.

771
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,030
What's the status of SG-1?

772
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,918
They should be airborne in a few minutes.

773
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,956
At this time, Mr. President,
it's my recommendation

774
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,474
we take our forces to DEFCON 2.

775
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,675
Do it.

776
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,353
- We should inform SG-1 that they're here.
- Yes, sir.

777
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,438
<i>Jackson, you may want
to strap in back there</i>

778
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,512
<i>and get some sleep.
Should be a long, boring ride.</i>

779
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,113
<i>Yeah, I hope so.</i>

780
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,398
Colonel Mitchell!

781
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,593
<i>We've just received a message
from Washington.</i>

782
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,035
<i>I'm told you'll understand.</i>

783
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,599
<i>"They're here. "</i>

784
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,318
What is that?

785
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,834
Something I've kept in stasis
a very long time,

786
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,480
so that one day I could place this call.

787
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,428
What do you mean he's on the phone?

788
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,273
It came directly through
the White House switchboard.

789
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,920
- From the spaceship? Ba'al?
- Lord Ba'al.

790
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,672
His words, not mine.

791
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,633
Yeah, right.

792
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,595
Thank you, Alex. Hello?

793
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,633
Mr. President.

794
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,190
I was beginning to think I wasn't going
to get through your gauntlet of minions.

795
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,236
<i>Who is this?
Who am I speaking to?</i>

796
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,514
I am Ba'al.

797
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,875
I assume by now you've detected
the presence of my fleet

798
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,188
in orbit over your planet?

799
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,354
As a matter of fact,
we have our eye on you.

800
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,954
<i>Please forgive this primitive means
of communication,</i>

801
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,349
but if I were to land my ship
in your rose garden,

802
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,398
or appear as a hologram in your office,

803
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,597
what kind of race of beings
would you think we are?

804
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,516
I wanted to give you
my personal assurance

805
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,319
that we come in peace,
seeking nothing more than friendship.

806
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,552
Well, we're glad to hear that down here.

807
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,119
Then let me further assuage your concerns

808
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,111
by meeting you in person
in your Oval Office.

809
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,434
I'm sure something can be arranged soon.

810
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,110
I was thinking this afternoon.

811
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,479
<i>It is the kind of thing
I can clear my schedule for.</i>

812
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,879
Excellent. Then perhaps we can get...

813
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,871
Put that down.

814
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,988
Mr. President,
I'm afraid I'll have to get back to you later.

815
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,992
He hung up on me.

816
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,070
The edges of the Shikra blade
have been honed

817
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,798
to the thickness of a single atom.

818
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,316
I must keep my hand very still,

819
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,995
for fear that one slip will cut you in half.

820
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:25,118
Now, tell me, how can you possibly know
so much about this world?

821
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:30,432
- I told you, my sweet.
- You've been studying in secret.

822
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,635
When?

823
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:36,111
You haven't allowed me to leave your side
in 50 years.

824
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,436
Every time you have defeated
your enemies, you've been one step ahead,

825
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,555
and now you are as familiar
with their world

826
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,675
as if you have lived among them,

827
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,558
and you even have
one of their communication devices. How?

828
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,552
For a short time, I confess,
I did live among them.

829
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,950
- When?
- Another life, another time.

830
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:58,588
This world offers many pleasures, Qetesh.
Pleasures I intend to share with you.

831
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,989
Not good enough.

832
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,070
My lord, forgive the intrusion.

833
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,790
Think nothing of it, Teal'c.

834
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,792
I have the results of our search
of the southernmost continent.

835
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,474
There is a Chappa'ai, as you predicted.

836
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,555
Thank you, Teal'c. You may leave us now.

837
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,552
However, my lord,
it is not lodged within a crevasse.

838
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,518
The humans have moved it
to a small settlement and taken it inside.

839
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,433
- It does not appear to be yet functional.
- What?

840
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,353
They have also drilled a shaft
deep inside the ice

841
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,953
elsewhere on the continent.

842
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,314
Impossible.

843
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,954
How could they have known?

844
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,554
Instruct the fleet
to bombard both locations

845
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,517
from space immediately.

846
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,989
Is that your wish, my lord?

847
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,195
Do it,

848
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,551
and report back to me when it's done.

849
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,478
Now, tell me,

850
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,474
my sweet.

851
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,149
Is your plan going as well
as you expected?

852
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,469
<i>You realize Ba 'al is going to
figure out where we're headed</i>

853
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,597
<i>before we get
within 1,000 miles of McMurdo.</i>

854
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,436
<i>- He thinks we're dead, remember?
Oh, we have him now.</i>

855
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,119
Hail the fleet.

856
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,360
This is Teal'c
aboard the Sovereign's flagship.

857
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,509
Lord Ba'al has given the order

858
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,397
to destroy targets
at the following coordinates

859
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,152
near the planet's South Pole.

860
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,516
Assign what vessels you see fit.
Fire when ready.

861
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:56,113
I talked to Ba'al directly,
and despite his assurances,

862
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,435
I have reasons to distrust him.
Very good reasons.

863
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:05,677
Yuri, I have to tell you about something
we're working on in the Antarctic

864
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,228
that might help us deal with them.

865
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,914
It involves an artifact we found
a couple of months ago...

866
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,479
Mr. President?

867
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,039
Hold on a sec.

868
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,554
- George, do you know who I'm talking to?
- Yes, sir.

869
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,313
A few minutes ago,
we lost contact with McMurdo.

870
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,439
The first report was something
about brilliant flashes of light in the sky,

871
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,750
then explosions all over the compound.

872
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,628
We also lost contact with the drilling site
above the Ancient weapons platform

873
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,438
at roughly the same time.

874
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,193
We're trying to get satellite pictures
to confirm.

875
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,511
So much for afternoon tea
in the rose garden.

876
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,512
Yuri, that project in the Antarctic
I was telling you about?

877
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,999
It's going backwards.

878
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,076
- My lord.
- Stay back, Teal'c.

879
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,799
My lord, shall I enact
your final instructions?

880
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,711
No, you idiot, save me.

881
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,110
- Try it, and I will kill him.
- You intend to kill him regardless.

882
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:05,513
- No! There must be some arrangement.
- Actually, my love, he's right.

883
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,319
Jaffa, treason!

884
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,154
<i>Sierra Golf One,
we're receiving an encoded message.</i>

885
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,434
<i>Stand by.</i>

886
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,835
<i>Message reads,
"McMurdo has been destroyed.</i>

887
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,152
<i>"Return to your previous position
and stand by for further instructions. "</i>

888
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,909
<i>- Understood.
- So much for that.</i>

889
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,592
<i>Well, what further instructions
can there be,</i>

890
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,511
<i>other than, "Kiss your ass goodbye"?</i>

891
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,160
<i>Oh, let's pull about turn and find out.</i>

892
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,433
- Master Teal'c.
- I am on a mission for the Sovereign.

893
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,875
We will cloak the ship immediately
and await further orders.

894
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,913
Hail Cronus.

895
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,108
<i>My queen.</i>

896
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,238
Our Lord Ba'al has seen the light.

897
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,835
He now wishes to blast the Tau'ri
into extinction.

898
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,559
<i>You are most persuasive.</i>

899
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,799
We shall return in three days.

900
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,518
The more of the planet
you have destroyed,

901
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,591
the more richly you shall be rewarded.

902
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,910
And if you see Teal'c, kill him.

903
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,997
<i>As the Sovereign wishes.</i>

904
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,070
Jaffa, set a course for Praxyon

905
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,993
and engage the hyperdrive
at maximum speed.

906
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,513
Yes, my queen.

907
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,591
This world is not enough.

908
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,516
The Sovereign's flagship
is leaving the fleet.

909
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,672
The Sovereign is dead,
betrayed by Qetesh.

910
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,954
Our only hope of avenging him

911
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,758
is to arrive at the planet Praxyon
before she does,

912
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,638
and the only way to do that
is through a Chappa'ai.

913
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,073
But you yourself ordered it destroyed.

914
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,918
There is another.

915
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,469
<i>Thanks for the top-up, boys.</i>

916
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,834
<i>Sierra Golf leader,</i>

917
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,310
<i>we're going to be right back
where we started...</i>

918
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,472
<i>Son of a bitch! Carter, break right!
Break right!</i>

919
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,438
<i>What city is that?</i>

920
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,434
<i>Washington.</i>

921
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,148
Listen to me,

922
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,074
because I don't think either one of us
has much time left.

923
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,470
If you have anything,
any information that could help...

924
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,715
Yuri, I can't hear you! What?

925
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,714
You've also discovered an artifact?

926
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,918
Where is it located?

927
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,550
<i>We're receiving another encoded
message with new flight instructions.</i>

928
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,757
<i>Message reads,
"The Russians have the other one. "</i>

929
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,831
<i>- Hello.
- "Do what you need to do. "</i>

930
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,558
<i>Roger that.</i>

931
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:40,794
<i>Coordinates received. Stopping for gas.
I estimate ETA at 19:30 Zulu.</i>

932
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,916
<i>Let's do what we need to do.</i>

933
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,758
We're on emergency power, sir,
and all the elevator shafts have collapsed.

934
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,877
We're not getting out of here
anytime soon.

935
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,428
Do we have confirmation
that our message got through to SG-1?

936
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,714
Yes, sir.

937
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,793
By now, they're well over
the North Atlantic.

938
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,997
<i>That last KC-135 pilot was
a bit stingy.</i>

939
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,593
<i>Fuel's going to be close.</i>

940
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:24,593
<i>I have multiple contacts down range
approaching at Mach 3.5.</i>

941
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,115
<i>Gliders?
- Yeah, that's a good bet.</i>

942
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,112
<i>They're coming through at 80,000 feet.</i>

943
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,158
<i>Sierra Golf escort,
we must complete our mission.</i>

944
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,798
<i>- Do you understand?
Affirmative.</i>

945
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,429
<i>Sierra Golf One and Two,
proceed to target. We will engage.</i>

946
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,799
<i>Here they come.</i>

947
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,154
<i>Oh, yeah! Just go ahead
and fall asleep back there, Jackson.</i>

948
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,593
<i>It's going to be a long, dull ride!</i>

949
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,752
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.
How many on our six?</i>

950
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,549
<i>Too many!</i>

951
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,559
<i>We can't shake them at altitude.</i>

952
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,232
<i>We're going to have to go down
to the deck.</i>

953
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,390
<i>Yeah, we're right behind you.</i>

954
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,590
<i>I've got another contact,
six bogies, dead ahead, coming right at us.</i>

955
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,353
<i>Sorry, Sam, we're kind of busy right now.</i>

956
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,435
<i>I don't think they're gliders. They're MiGs!</i>

957
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,999
<i>Jackson, get on the radio!</i>

958
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,273
<i>What the hell did you just say?</i>

959
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,636
<i>"We're Americans.
Please shoot the people chasing us!"</i>

960
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,509
<i>We have
been expecting you! Good luck!</i>

961
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,192
<i>Yeah, back at you.</i>

962
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,831
<i>I can see the coast.</i>

963
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,593
<i>Sierra, rejoin,
we're going to head on down.</i>

964
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:15,908
<i>Copy that.</i>

965
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,599
This is not encouraging.

966
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:49,909
Where is everybody?

967
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,752
At home with their families,
where I should be.

968
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,831
I need to speak to the lead scientist
on this project.

969
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,388
He is not here.
None of them have been here for weeks.

970
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,278
- Really?
- We had no idea of purpose of artifact.

971
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,909
We named it Anchor,
because it was found on bottom of ocean.

972
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,433
Are there any grown-ups around
that we could talk to?

973
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,712
Boys, we need power.

974
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,077
What you see now is emergency batteries.

975
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,038
We lost main power to facility
over three hours ago.

976
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,680
Oh, okay, we understand that,
but we've come a very, very long way

977
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,398
to use this device.

978
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,948
I cannot give you what I do not have.

979
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,511
- What was that?
- It sounds like a ship. Al'kesh?

980
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,554
And it's landing on the roof. Just great.

981
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,076
- We must get out of here.
- Hey, your weapon.

982
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,913
- Hands up.
- Don't.

983
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,795
Teal'c?

984
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,437
How do you know my name?

985
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,635
I can do better than that.
You're from Chulak,

986
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,676
your best friend goes
by the name of Bra'tac,

987
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,069
and you're the First Prime of...

988
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,912
Jackson, whose mark is that?

989
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,319
Ba'al.

990
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,118
What did he promise to win you over?

991
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,792
The freedom of my people.

992
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,552
I'll give him credit
for knowing which button to push.

993
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,438
Ba'al is dead. Slain by his queen.

994
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,829
Oh, don't tell us, Qetesh.

995
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,235
Indeed.

996
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,799
Why?

997
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,269
That is none of your concern.

998
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,511
Allow us passage through the Chappa'ai,
and your lives may be spared.

999
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,398
Or you tell us what you're up to,
and your lives will be spared.

1000
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,391
My only concern is my mission.

1001
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,198
Which is?

1002
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:02,831
To avenge Ba'al's death.
The final task of a First Prime.

1003
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,119
- Indeed.
- Well, that sounds great.

1004
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,077
- We'll help out, right, guys?
- Sure, why not?

1005
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,388
- I'm not busy.
- Let's do it.

1006
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,789
I do not require your assistance.

1007
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,192
My ship has been detected.

1008
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,919
Its shields have been extended
to protect this building and the Chappa'ai,

1009
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,551
- but it will not hold for long.
- What do you say we all get out of here?

1010
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:37,429
We can all die here when that shield fails,
or we can go through the gate together

1011
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,715
and continue this discussion
on the other side.

1012
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,279
It's up to you.

1013
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,348
This device will power the Chappa'ai.

1014
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,636
I like that. No hesitation.

1015
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,032
Let's go! Go!

1016
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,475
Give me a reason I should not kill you
where you stand.

1017
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,951
Because you're a good man.

1018
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,194
Because

1019
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:59,630
somewhere, deep down, you realize
we're supposed to be on the same side.

1020
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,917
Because we can offer you
the freedom of your people.

1021
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,158
Really?

1022
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:11,198
This is Ba'al's failsafe. It has to be.

1023
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,113
I think this whole place
is his time machine.

1024
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:36,313
Teal'c, you have to understand,
in the timeline we just came from,

1025
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,834
the Goa'uld are defeated
and the Jaffa are free.

1026
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,708
Now, Ba'al used a machine
to go back in time and change all of that.

1027
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,836
He made you his First Prime
and Qetesh his queen

1028
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,831
so he could control you.

1029
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,268
This is the secret
for which Ba'al was murdered.

1030
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,998
So that's why you think
Qetesh is on her way here?

1031
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,275
She wants to use this device for herself.

1032
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:58,319
- That cannot be allowed to happen.
- See? We agree about everything.

1033
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,319
Teal'c, if you let us use this device,

1034
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,551
we can return history
to the way it was meant to be.

1035
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,471
The Goa'uld will be gone?

1036
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,513
- My people will be free?
- You have our word.

1037
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,157
Let it be done.

1038
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,118
It'll just take me a few minutes
to figure out exactly how it works.

1039
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,316
That may be all the time we have.

1040
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,630
By my reckoning,
Qetesh will be here at any moment.

1041
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,073
Thank you.

1042
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,630
Well, you heard the man.

1043
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,198
There must be satellites
orbiting every one of these stars.

1044
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,759
There's hundreds of them,

1045
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,230
each sending real-time telemetry
back to this computer through subspace.

1046
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,278
Exactly how does that add up
to a time machine?

1047
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,719
They're looking for something specific.

1048
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,914
Solar flares.
Exactly.

1049
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,639
Until now, other than Ancient technology,
the only way we know

1050
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,312
of traveling backward
and forward through time

1051
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,469
is to pass through a wormhole

1052
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,199
as it intersects the magnetic field
of a solar flare.

1053
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,998
Now, with enough satellites
and enough computing...

1054
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,389
Yeah, that's brilliant.
Which button do we press?

1055
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:16,233
Yeah, I think it's a little more complicated
than that.

1056
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,594
Actually, not much.

1057
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,557
We just need to choose a time and place

1058
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,108
sometime before Ba'al can put his plan
into motion.

1059
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,633
They are here.

1060
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,475
Sam.

1061
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,232
Well, if you want to go back
to the Cretaceous period,

1062
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,675
we can go right now,
otherwise we have to wait for a flare

1063
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,151
capable of sending us back to a time
and place that's a little more useful.

1064
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,395
Sam!

1065
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,073
I've found one,
but you're not going to like it!

1066
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:27,232
- Why not?
- It'll send us back to 1929.

1067
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,231
That's 10 years too soon!

1068
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,316
Well, it'll have to do,
because I'm just about out of...

1069
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,309
Once I dial the stargate,

1070
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,516
we'll have less than 20 seconds
to get through!

1071
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,114
Dial it up and get your ass down here!

1072
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,949
Carter!

1073
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,189
Teal'c!

1074
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,955
Jaffa!

1075
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:57,989
Teal'c.

1076
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,554
You are the most

1077
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:23,314
stubborn Jaffa I have ever known.

1078
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,639
Perhaps

1079
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,988
I shall choose you as my First Prime

1080
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,314
after all.

1081
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,315
I...

1082
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,592
Think not, Qetesh.

1083
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,354
I die...

1084
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,989
Free.

1085
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,229
Make your course
three-five-zero.

1086
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,470
Three-five-zero. Aye, Captain.

1087
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:19,475
We'd be in Boston by now

1088
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,154
if we weren't zigzagging
all over the bloody Atlantic.

1089
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,196
You'd rather make it easy for the U-boats?

1090
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,952
We're not at war yet.

1091
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,590
Check to see the cargo's secure.

1092
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,319
You're never going to tell me
what it is, are you?

1093
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,072
If I knew myself...

1094
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:58,709
Captain.

1095
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,153
We're about to be boarded.

1096
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,117
- Boarded?
- Get over there.

1097
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,996
- How?
- Don't shoot until I do.

1098
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,954
Back up.

1099
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,558
Who are you?

1100
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,996
You might say I'm a friend of the family.

1101
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,718
What happened here?

1102
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,598
Well, that could take a while to explain.

1103
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,116
Begin the extraction process.

1104
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,435
Behold!

1105
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,270
The last of the System Lords.

1106
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:39,919
- I guess that was worth seeing.
- What?

1107
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,913
That's all you have to say?

1108
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,070
Well, you guys made it out
like it was this big deal.

1109
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:48,199
- I expected something more spectacular.
- Nope.

1110
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:51,556
That's pretty much
the extraction ceremony, right there.

1111
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,434
Yup. Right.

1112
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,116
So, lunch, anyone?

1113
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,355
- I'm buying.
- I'm in.

1114
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,317
Actually, sir, I was hoping
that we could go over the plans

1115
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,676
- for the new moon base.
- What moon base?

1116
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:15,030
You know, I think I might stay awhile
and help him through this.

1117
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:18,712
- Yeah, I thought you might. Have fun.
- Thanks.

1118
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,197
He's in for an interesting afternoon.

1119
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,509
Indeed.

1120
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,115
What do you think Ba'al was talking about

1121
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,192
when he said,
"You've all made a terrible mistake?"

1122
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,590
- We shall never know.
- I know I ain't going to worry about it.

1123
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:44,672
I was just thinking,
what if he really wasn't the last one?

1124
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,751
- He was the last one.
- As far as we know.

1125
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,515
Yeah, as far as we know,
but you can't obsess about this stuff.

1126
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:53,273
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- I know I am. Come on, let's go.

1127
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,078
When was the last time
General O'Neill bought lunch?

1128
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,434
Good point.
