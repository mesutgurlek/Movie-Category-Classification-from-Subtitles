- He's built 25 of them here.
- Right, sir.

113
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,999
The man's related to the royal family,
for goodness'sake.

114
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,995
As far as the prime minister's
concerned, he's one of the
greatest friends England's got.

- Perfectly, sir.
- Good.

- Oh, yes.
- And, uh, English...

121
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,069
we can't afford any mistakes...
not tonight.

with you, sir?

So, are you here
in some professional capacity?

- And yourself?

If I told you that,
I'm afraid I'd have to kill you.

So, are you here alone,

That's how I choose
to live my life, Miss Campbell.

Women want safety, security.
I can offer them nothing but danger.

Women like you,

for yourself.

Oh, it's for me, actually. Could your
rustle up some of those cheesy niblets?

159
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,915
Now, where were we?

160
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,833
You obviously haven't met
our host, Monsieur Sauvage.

161
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,990
No, thank God.

162
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,631
You know, I think I'd rather have
my bottom impaled on a giant cactus...

163
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,359
than exchange pleasantries
with that jumped-up Frenchman.

164
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,355
As far as I'm concerned, the only thing
the French should host is an invasion.

165
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,433
[Snickers]
Sorry, can I help?

166
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,035
Pascal Sauvage,
jumped-up Frenchman.

167
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,112
Lorna Campbell. I've been so looking
forward to meeting you.

168
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,760
- Enchante.
- [Muttering]

169
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,912
But of course! You're Johnny English.
I've heard all about you.

170
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,515
And between you and me,
I'm not so keen on the French myself.

171
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,478
But please
don't tell them that.

172
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,757
Let me go and search
for your nibbly cheese bits.

173
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,674
- No, no, no. L...
- I insist. The French are,
after all, fantastic waiters.

174
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,876
- The best in the world.
- Well... But-But...

175
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,032
- Wait here, and I will wait on you.
- No, really. There's no...

176
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,317
No. Please, please, please!

177
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,431
Hmm. Les Francais.

178
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,719
Ils sont very...
n'est-ce pas?

179
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,875
Ladies and gentlemen,
mesdames est messieurs,

180
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,431
bienvenus, welcome tonight
to this wonderful occasion.

181
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,229
As we stand here
in the Tower of London,

182
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,390
the most famous prison
in the world,

183
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,916
where these wonderful
jewels will rest safely...

184
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,116
under lock and key,

185
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,919
I want to thank you...

186
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,151
for giving me
this wonderful experience...

187
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,677
to contribute to the restoration
of these jewels.

188
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,072
It was, as we say in France,
le top, le best of.

189
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,594
- [Feigned Chuckle]
- And what a beautiful...

190

[Woman Screams]

193
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,438
It's Colonel Chevenix! He's got
a nasty wound, sir. Who hit him?

194
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,990
The assailant.
He ran in here.

195
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,435
Bough, you guard the door.

196
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,069
Aha!
[Grunting]

197
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,594
[Pounding, Grunting]

198
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,036
For God's sake, Bough, don't come in.
The man's a maniac!

199
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,351
- [Guests Gasp]
- You don't frighten me!

200
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,590
- [Glass Shatters]
- Missed!

201
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,478
[Guests Gasping]

202
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,873
[Grunting Continues]

203
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,189
[Karate Yells]

204

[Body Falls]

205
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,034
- [Guests Gasping]
- I've managed to subdue the assailant.

206
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,193
The panic's over.
Everything's under control.

207
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,068
- [Applause]
- [Chevenix Groans]

208
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,913
Thank you. And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

209
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,753
we should compose ourselves
for the arrival of Her Majesty...

210
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,912
and return to the site
of our great nation's...

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,278
magnificently restored
Crown Jewels.

212
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,269
[All Gasping]

213
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,271
I know.
I feel it too.

214
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,749
The very symbols
of our island nation,

215
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,594
so close we could almost
reach out and...

216
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,038
- [Trumpet Fanfare]
- Pray silence
for Her Majesty the Queen.

217
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,078
[Queen]
Oh, where are thejewels?

218
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,355
[Pegasus]
It's an unmitigated disaster, English.

219
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,193
I couldn't agree more, sir.

220
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,909
Well, we need to get these
jewels back, English, and fast.

221
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,714
Tell me about this assailant.
When they searched the room,
there was no sign of him.

222
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,598
Well, the man was clearly
a professional.

223
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,752
He must have escaped while
the queen was being sedated.

224
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,752
But he's the only lead we've got.
We have to find him.

225
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,833
Come in. This is...
This is Roger from Data Support.

226
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,957
Please sit down. He'll produce
a likeness based on your description.

227
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,316
So tell us,
what did this man look like?

228
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,392
Um... well...

229
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,597
he was... big.

230
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,471
- Hair colour?
- Um... orange.

231
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,597
- Orange?
- Mmm. And curly.

232
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,309
Well, frizzy, actually.
Frizzy sort of thing.

233
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,834
- Frizzy.
- An eyepatch.

234
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,390
Broken nose.
Very few teeth.

235
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,710
Two, I would say,
at the most.

236
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,076
And a scar on his cheek...

237
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,392
in the shape... of a banana.

238
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,359
- Which cheek?
- Both cheeks.

239
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,238
They sort of met
in the middle.

240
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,030
Are you sure
about this, English?

241
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,432
[Gasps] Oh, yes, that's him.
An uncanny resemblance.

242
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,718
Why, it's just as if
he's in the room with us.

243
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,394
[Horn Honking,
Tyres Screeching]

244
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,520
Wow! Look at this, sir.
Got all the bells and whistles.

245
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,478
Never mind about the gadgets.
Just focus on the case.

246
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,471
[Horn Honks]

247
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,475
[Engine Revs]

248
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,313
Oh, uh...

249
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,555
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you very much for waiting.

250
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,918
Now, the question that faces us
this morning is a simple one.

251
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,391
Namely, how did the thieves gain access
to this highly secure environment...

252
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,677
and then escape
with thejewels afterwards?

253
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,550
A simple question, but one
which I believe has a complex answer.

254
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,757
- Actually, sir...
- Uh, please, Bough. My mind is at work.

255
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,718
Now, what you must grasp, gentlemen,
is that the master criminal...

256
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,998
sees not a room
but a series of opportunities.

257
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,355
Should I go in
through the window?

258
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,351
Possibly.

259
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,797
- Should I drop down from the ceiling?
- Actually, sir...

260
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,634
There's one thing I think
we can be fairly confident about,

261
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,280
that is that they didn't
come up through the floor...

262
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,476
I've got you, sir.

263
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,233
That's all right.
Just come my way, Bough.

264
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,949
- That'll bring me
right over the hole, sir.
- There's no need to panic.

265
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,355
Can you see
the bottom yet, Bough?

266
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,273
Not yet, sir. The shaft
appears to be narrowing.

267
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,193
I'm just a little bit worried
I might get stuck.

268
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,432
Trust me, Bough. You won't
get stuck if you just keep moving.

269
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,193
Yes, sir.
[Bough Grunting]

270
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,113
I'm okay, sir.

271
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,555
Are you at the bottom
now, Bough?

272
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,074
No, I am in fact
stuck now, sir.

273
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,755
Oh, for God's sake, Bough.
Stay there! I'm coming down.

274
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,957
Uh, I'm not especially sure
that's a good idea, sir.

275
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,759
Don't worry.

276
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,274
Be careful, sir!

277
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,829
Gently does it.

278
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,559
- [Screaming]
- Sir?

279
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,473
- Are you all right, sir?
- Yes. I landed on something quite soft.

280
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,233
- That was me, sir.
- Oh, good.

281
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,551
What now?

282
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,393
There's no way back
up there, that's for sure.

283
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,471
But this must lead
somewhere.

284
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,630
I'm slightly uncomfortable
in the dark, sir.

285
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,870
There's nothing
to worry about, Bough.

286
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,873
- It may be pitch black,
but we can still see.
- Can we, sir? How?

287
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,633
The Bedouin monks of
the Al Maghreb mountains...

288
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,029
developed a system
of sonic chanting.

289
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,759
- I see, sir.
- The sound of their chanting...

290
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,990
would bounce back
off any obstacles,

291
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,275
and using their
highly tuned ears...

292
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,079
they could paint a mental picture
of the path ahead.

293
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,232
- Brilliant, sir.
- However, you must always
sing in E-flat.

294
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,709
[Humming]

295
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,078
E-flat, E-flat, E-flat

296
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,870
Thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing

297
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,554
- Is it working, sir?
- Extremely well, thank you, Bough.

298
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,551
Thanks for all
the joy that...

299
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,551
- [Thud]
- Ow!

300
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,950
You all right, sir? I think
I can see something, sir.

301
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,474
Oh, yeah. Come on.

302
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,233
[Quiet Chattering]

303
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,676
[Man]
Here is the long one.

304
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,796
[Man #2]
It is a long one.

305
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,836
Careful.

306
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,710
- I knew it.
- Shall we call for backup, sir?

307
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,634
What? And watch some fat-bottomed
bobby make our arrest for us?

308
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,631
I don't think so.

309
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,072
Good morning, gentlemen.
Ml7 at your service.

310
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,915
Observe, Bough, the dull
incompetence of the criminal mind.

311
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,073
It can never hope to match
our level of technical expertise.

312
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,150
- [Tyres Screeching]
- [Coughing]

313
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,316
- You've got it.
- [Bough] What do we do now, sir?

314
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,391
Watch and learn, Bough.

315
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,279
- They're too far ahead of us.
- Have faith, Bough.
They're heading south.

316
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,670
[Nuns Screaming]

317
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,433
- There they are, sir!
- Just as I thought.

318
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,515
- Hang on tight, Bough.
- [Bough Groaning]

319
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,350
- [Horns Honking]
- We're never gonna catch them in this.

320
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,318
- Take the wheel, Bough.
I'm getting in the Aston.
- Sir?

321
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,312
[Truck Horn Honking]

322
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,109
Change places, Bough.
I'm getting out the other side.

323
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,111
Sir?

324
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,070
Set, Bough.
Take me up.

325
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,394
Swing me out, Bough!

326
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,470
- Whoa.
- Down.

327
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,428
- [Horn Honking]
- Up! Up!

328
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,078
Sorry!

329
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,236
Bough, pull out!

330
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,238
Ow! Ow!

331
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,199
Those idiots
are right behind us. Faster!

332
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,673
[Horns Honking]

333
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,830
Uh-huh.

334
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,750
[Beeping]

335
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,913
[Horn Honking]

336
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,040
Drop me here, Bough!

337
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,476
Ow! Oh.

338
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,757
No! No! No!

339
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,195
[Bough]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

340
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,634
[Engine Starts, Revs]

341
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,392
[English] They're turning into
the Brompton Cemetery.

342
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,870
Get here as soon as you can.
I'm going in.

343
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,158
In a wheelchair. But Geoffrey
overcame these terrible disabilities...

344
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,949
with that simple resilience
and sunny optimism...

345
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,112
that so warmed
all of us who knew him,

346
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,555
spending the rest of his life
in the service...

347
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,518
of the poor and disabled
of this parish.

348
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,639
It's very good.
Really very good.

349
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,359
No, no, please go on.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

350
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,193
- It's very entertaining.
- Who's that?

351
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,149
That priest act of yours should keep the
other prisoners entertained for hours.

352
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,073
Oh, I'm so sorry. Where are
my manners? Johnny English,

353
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,277
British Secret Service,
and you are all under arrest.

354
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,920
I must say you've done
this whole thing very well.

355
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,514
The attention to detail
is excellent.

356
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,637
You, the grieving granny,
you're very convincing.

357
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,679
Oh, look. Real tears.
Do you get paid extra for that?

358
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,514
Ahh, what
we're all here for.

359
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,990
I know! Why don't we
take a look inside?

360
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,631
- [Mourners Gasp]
- Oh, you've nailed it down!

361
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,075
Why would you do that?

362
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,950
I know you're gonna come back
in two weeks and dig it up again.

363
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,349
[Hums]

364
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,309
Now, what are you playing in this
little vignette of deceit and villainy?

365
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,436
I'm the hearse driver.

366
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,193
- You're the hearse driver?
- Yes, sir.

367
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,590
- You're the hearse driver?
- Yes, sir.

368
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,558
Ah! Aha!

369
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,950
There you are... Gunther.

370
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,192
Uh, I do hope he hasn't
made a nuisance of himself.

371
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,750
I'm Doctor, um...

372
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,557
Bough, of the Lunatic
Response Unit.

373
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,599
I'm afraid Gunther here wasn't
supposed to be released until 2028.

374
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,399
Isn't that right, Gunther?

375
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,758
Yes, yes, there's been
the most monumental cock-up.

376
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,195
Um, if you'll excuse me,
with the deepest respect,

377
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,510
utmost sympathy.

378
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,194
Uh, he hasn't urinated
on anyone, has he?

379
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,998
- No.
- No, no.

380
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,232
That's a blessing. Are you
gonna give me the gun, Gunther?

381
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,309
There. That wasn't
too difficult, was it?

382
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,473
- Are you going to come home now?
- [Speaking Gibberish]

383
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,990
[Speaking Gibberish]

384
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,517
Oh... in the van!
Yes, we are going in the van.

385
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,909
Yes, yes.
Vroom, vroom.

386
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,072
- Vroom, vroom. Vroom, vroom.
- Yes. Yeah.

387
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,517
- [Gibberish]
- Yes. He's waving good-bye.
Good-bye, everyone.

388
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,909
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Gunther.

389
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,753
Mind the nice dead people.
There we go.

390
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,632
[Squeaks]

391
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,713
Oh, we'll just go to the path
here. There. Big step.

392
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,110
It's a graveyard. It's
where they bring people...

393
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,270
Yes, all right.
You can stop now.

394
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,114
- For appearances,
I'll just hold your arm.
- Just keep walking.

395
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,555
In fact, run, run, run!

396
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,035
I can't believe
I've done this.

397
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,238
I mean, I really
cannot believe I've done this!

398
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,671
You see, 200 years ago,

399
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,595
my family should have inherited
the throne of England,

400
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,433
but they were cast aside.

401
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,751
Well, in a few
very short days,

402
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,957
it will be back
where it belongs.

403
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,120
With me.

404
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,513
Shall I try it on?
Yes? No? Maybe?

405
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,513
To make you king, we need
the archbishop of Canterbury to do that.

406
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,670
The archbishop of Canterbury...

407
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,639
is being taken care of
even as we speak.
TARGET ACQUIRED

408
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,837
TARGET LOCKED

409
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,148
There's only one thing, sir.
What are we going to do about English?

410
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,793
If I were you, I wouldn't worry
too much about English.

411
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,509
He is no threat to us.
I had his flat bugged.

412
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,635
[Karate Yells]

413
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,708
- [Yells]
- [Duck Squeaks]

414
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,270
Clearly, the aptly named
English is a fool.

415
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,875
He might be a fool, but he's
a fool who keeps showing up.

416
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,873
Well, the next time
he shows up,

417
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,996
eliminate him.

418
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,069
Thank you.

419
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,630
Dieter Klein
and Klaus Vendetta, sir.

420
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,508
Released from prison six months ago.
327 convictions between them.

421
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,636
Armed robbery,
grievous bodily harm...

422
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,029
and combined parking fines
of more than 400...

423
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,953
Uh, yes, all right. Thank you, Bough.
I think we get the picture.

424
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,192
The point is, sir,
that Vendetta and Klein...

425
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,670
are both in the employ
of Monsieur Sauvage.

426
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,752
- Pascal Sauvage?
- Precisely, sir.

427
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,593
But you're not suggesting
Sauvage is involved?

428
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,750
I think he's more
than just involved, sir.

429
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,195
I'm convinced he's
up to his French neck in it.

430
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,670
Don't be absurd. Sauvage
employs thousands of people.

431
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,877
Just because two of them
are villains doesn't mean that he is.

432
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,952
I want him discounted from this
investigation immediately.

433
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,951
Yes, sir.

434
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,115
All right. Tonight I shall be
at Sauvage's reception
for the new French ambassador.

435
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,873
Any developments,
you can reach me there.

436
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,350
Apart from that, I don't want you
within a hundred miles of the man.

437
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,396
Absolutely, sir.

438
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,395
Requisition order: Ml7 quartermasters
for immediate supply;

439
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,439
one military transport plane,
fully fueled, with permission
for nighttime city over flight;

440
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,991
two night camouflage parachutes,
plus reserves, plus neoprene
bodysuits, twice, in black.

441
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,275
I've never liked the navy blue.

442
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,716
And a 40-inch chest for me
'cause I need the sleeve length.

443
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,119
- Morning, Felch.
- Morning.

444
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,589
Oh, and two Special Forces
signet rings,

445
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,591
primed and colour-coded.

446
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,240
- What's all this for?
- For tonight's operation.

447
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,039
We're going to break into
Sauvage's headquarters.

448
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,395
- But Pegasus said...
- Let me worry about Pegasus.

449
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,712
I know that Sauvage
is behind all this, and tonight
we're going to get the evidence.

450
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,076
- Is something wrong, sir?
- Did that sound like Felch to you?

451
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,237
[Whispers]
Bough...

452
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,275
[Whispers]
You, upstairs.

453
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,274
[Grunts, Groans]

454
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,271
Ow.

455
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,310
Can you see him, Bough?

456
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,517
He's on the upper level, sir.

457
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,791
Got him.

458
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,878
And like a coiled viper...
he strikes.

459
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,749
[Bough Groans]

460
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,872
So what you're saying, sir,
is there must have been two of them?

00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,596
- I'm not quite getting
that second word, sir.
- "Schlaaaagh!"

615
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,591
- Write it down, sir.
- "Schlaaaagh!"

616

Yes!
[Muttering Gibberish]

Car! Take the car!
We came by plane.

619

[Muttering Gibberish]
Bugger off!

620
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,395
- Hold it right there.
- [Groans]

621
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,870
- What's wrong with them?
- I'm not telling you.

622
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,758
Wrong answer.

623
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,990
What is it with you two?

624
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,310
Huh?
[Groaning]

625

Let's get outta here.

626
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,311
Sorry, but who are you,
exactly?

627
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,994
Special Agent Campbell.
I'm attached to Interpol in Paris.

628
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,275
We've been watching Sauvage
for months.

629
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,271
Why?

630
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,432
Because every major convict released
from a Sauvage prison in six months...

631
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,670
has been employed
by one of his companies.

632
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,115
We believe he's recruiting them
for a major criminal conspiracy.

633
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,794
- We just don't know what yet.
- [English Mumbles Gibberish]

634
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,315
- What did he say?
- Pegasus!

635
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,675
We have to report
to Pegasus!

636
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,716
Oh, no, sir.
No, no, no.

637
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,792
- How do we get out of here?
- Hey, you two!

638
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,553
What you did to me
really hurt.

639
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,872
Yeah. Sorry about that. How do we
get out of here without being seen?

640
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,633
Okay.

- Left, sir. Left!
- [English Muttering]

[Bough] Sir, you can't go
to Sauvage's reception in this state.

Excuse me, sir.
I'm very sorry to interrupt...

Pascal, how nice
to see you again.

663
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,394
- Enjoying the party?
- Oh, splendid affair.

664
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:46,395
I was until I was informed
that your man English...

665
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,313
and his curious boyfriend here
have spent the evening...

666
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,790
breaking into my office
and assaulting my staff.

667
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,031
- Is this true, Bough?
- Well, we... we...

What do you think
you're up to?

00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,073
- Sir, if I could just offer...
- Go home, Bough!

670
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,912
Now!

671
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,514
I gave you direct orders
not to meddle with Sauvage.

672
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,910
What do you do? Break into his office
and assault two of his staff.

673
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,232
Then you march in here,
loaded with God knows what,
and insult the foreign secretary.

674
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,039
I haven't encountered such
behaviour in Whitehall in 30 years.

00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,918
- But...
- There are no "buts," English.

676
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,470
You're off the case. Your security
clearance is hereby cancelled.

677

After a three-month leave of absence,
you will return at your old grade.

678
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,872
And I hope never
to hear your name again.

Get rid of
the fake archbishop...

and green-light
the visit to Her Majesty.

Then this pathetic country
can humiliate itself...

trying to track down

to a police station
in North London,

00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,119
Pascal Sauvage has requested
that his coronation...

710

take place
this Thursday.

711
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,508
In the House, the prime minister said he
was looking forward to the ceremony...

712
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,034
and he believed that Monsieur Sauvage
will make a fine king...

best about modern Europe
to our ancient institutions.

- Sauvage is heading back to France.

717
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,191
He's invited 13 of
the richest criminal masterminds
in the world to meet him there.

Are you gonna sit here in this

Or are you gonna get out there
and save your country?

The fact is, the moment Sauvage
gets that crown on his head,

734
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,397
he'll be able to do whatever he likes
with the country that I love,

and that is why you and I
have got to stop him.

Well, it's been three years
since my fiance left me,

and since then I haven't
made love to anyone.

But then I met you...

744
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,598
and I felt this...
hunger...

745
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,797
deep down inside.

746
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,952
I wanted to say things to you,
I wanted to do things to you...

747

in a very, very, very long time.

What sort of things
are we talking about?

751
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,718
Things like
punching you in the face,

752
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,031
kicking you in the backside for being
such a pompous, know-nothing asshole.

00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,238
But then I started to see beyond
the idiot that everybody else saw.

754
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,232
I started to see
the man on the inside...

755
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,279
who was determined to do his duty,
no matter what or who lay in his way.

756
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:10,148
And I began to feel
other things for him,

757
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,870
to want to do
other things for him.

758
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,315
Things...

759
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,029
involving plastic toys
and soft cheese?

760
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:25,636
- What? [Scoffs]
- What? What?

761
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,998
You're toying with me.
You're telling me to stop in
the gentlest way you know how.

No. N-N-No...

You're such a special person...

764
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,912
not to take advantage of me
while I'm vulnerable.

765
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,434
- N-No... Well...
- So thank you...

766
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,715
for being such a gentleman.

767
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,355
Not at all.

01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,231
I know what you're thinking,
Miss Campbell.

769
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,039
If we don't pull this off, God knows
what might happen to England.

770
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,396
Actually, I was thinking there must be
a better way in than that pipe.

771
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,516
Well, there isn't.

772
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,512
I've analysed it from every angle,
and this is the best option.

773
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,229
I'll go in first, and if it's a clear
way through, I'll call down.

774
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,876
Johnny.

775
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,111
- Be careful.
- I'm always careful.

776
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,997
Ohh.

777

- Gentlemen.

781

In a few hours time...

782
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,320
I will become
the next king of England.

783

[Whispers]
Oh, no.

Hyah...
[Gagging, Coughing]

785
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,953
- How did you get here?
- Up the ladder.

786
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,474
Pull yourself together.
It's only a bit of poo.

787
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,557
Oh! Oh, it's cold!
It's cold!

788
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,672
What is the one commodity...

789
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,436
the world never seems
to run out of?

790
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,556
Criminals, gentlemen.

- [Guests Murmuring]
- Lawbreakers.

792
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,515
Every nation in the world
struggles...

793
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,239
with the issue
of overcrowded prisons.

794
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:41,440
So, what do we do
with all these villains?

795
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,432
Find the solution
to that problem...

796
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,718
and the governments of the world
would pay you through their nose.

797
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,709
Fortunately,
I have found a solution.

798
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,793
We empty every prison
on the entire planet,

799
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,715
we take the resulting
tidal wave of human scum...

800
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,360
and we put it here.

801

[Gasping, Murmuring]

802
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,116
The moment
I am crowned king,

803
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,794
I will turn England
into the largest prison...

804
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,633
in the history
of the world.

805
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,355
210,000 square miles...

806
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,510
of prime real estate...

807
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,149
conveniently separated
from true civilization...

808
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,390
by 20 miles of ocean...

809
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,630
- and soon to be available...
- Come on.

810
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:39,431
For the entire world
to dump its human waste in.

811
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,511
According to
current projections,

812
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:47,277
we will not run out of prison space
for the next 500 years.

813
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,273
So, tonight one,
and only one, of you...

814
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:56,229
will leave here
owning 49 percent...

815
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,629
of this venture.

816
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:03,430
So that's his little game.
We must get hold of that DVD.

817
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,512
But how, Johnny?
There's only two of us.

818
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,750
You're young, Miss Campbell,
and inexperienced.

819
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,070
What you seem to
have forgotten is that...

820
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,470
[Over P.A. Speaker]
Nobody knows we are here.

821
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,916
At our disposal we have
the vital element of surprise.

822
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,958
Now, my plan is simple
but effective.

823
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,431
I shall drop from the gallery
at this end of the room
and take Sauvage prisoner.

824
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,957
You will then enter from the far door,
cutting off any means of escape.

825
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:35,273
Then, using Sauvage as a hostage,
we'll get the hell out of here. Clear?

826
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,675
Get 'em up,
you French ponce.

827
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,117
But, Mr English,
I'm gobsmacked!

828
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,589
What an unexpected surprise.

829
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,150
Surprises are very much
my speciality, Sauvage.

830
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,033
I think we've seen
enough of this.

831
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:05,673
I know exactly what you're planning,
and I'm here to put a stop to it.

832
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,311
My bottom will be king of England
before you are.

Wrong again.

834
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,472
Perhaps you'd care
to look behind you.

01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,790
Oh, please.

I'm sorry, Johnny.

Well, I'm afraid
that we'll have to...

conclude the floor show
for tonight.

841
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,832
Not so fast, Sauvage.

842
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,232
You may have taken me,
but you'll never take England.

843
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,993
Not as long as I have
breath in my body...

844
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,275

the crowning of our first French king...

This is not good,
Johnny.

859
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,910
We've got to think
of something.

860
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,717
[Johnny]
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

Hop! Hop!

And hop! And hop!
And stop!

863
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,475
Now, are you familiar...

864
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:56,109
with the shaman throat warblers
of the Guatemalan delta?

865

What?

866
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,511
It has long been
their belief...

867
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,479
that a whistle pitched at the precise
resonant frequency of a metal lock...

868
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,473
will vibrate the levers in such a way
that the door will simply swing open.

and face facts?

Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone

1082
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,552
So alone
But safe at home

1083
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,278
Queen and country
Safe and sound

1084
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,112
With villains
six feet underground

1085
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,919
And no one knows 'cause
no one's found any trace

1086
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,355
Of a man for all seasons

1087
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,512
Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone

1088
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,319
So alone

1089
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,038
And you and I
wouldn't have a clue

1090
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,111
Who's doin' what, why
when and who

1091
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,952
Up a creek with no canoe

1092
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:48,191
Watch out for
the man for all seasons

1093
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,272
Loves 'em
and leaves 'em alone

1094
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,509
So alone

1095
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,912
But safe at home

1096
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,549
Oh-Oh-Ohh, yeah
