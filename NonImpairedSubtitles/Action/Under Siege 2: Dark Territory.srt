1
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:01,790
Tom, glad to see you made it.

2
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,828
l wouldn't miss it.

3
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:06,856
National Weather lnstitute,
this is NASA Command.

4
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:10,060
Transferring control
of satellite Gulf-001...

5
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,561
...in six...

6
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:13,570
...five...four....

7
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,331
Do source code.

8
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:22,745
Enter current access code.
Captains Trilling, Gilder....

9
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:39,956
We got it. lt's ours.

10
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,126
Be advised...

11
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,966
...we have received satellite Gulf-001 .
Thank you, Houston.

12
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:49,204
All right, let's see what she can do.

13
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:53,269
Activating observation function.

14
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:56,373
Setting for Stage 2.

15
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,781
What have we got here?

16
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,882
Clean it up.

17
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:13,287
Oh, my God, she's turning over!

18
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:17,924
Apply full image enhancing.

19
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:24,904
Holy guacamole!

20
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:28,905
The damn thing works.

21
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:31,815
That goddamn Travis Dane.

22
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:36,611
lf the optical circuits are this good,
the targeting system must be great.

23
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:38,585
Dane would love this.

24
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:41,884
NASA thinks this is
a weather satellite.

25
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:45,054
Let's do a weapons check.

26
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:49,091
This wasn't the bust
Congress thought it was.

27
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:52,068
What Congress doesn't know
won't hurt them, or us.

28
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,133
Something wrong, Captain?

29
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,572
lt's too bad Dane wasn't here today.

30
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:58,970
Travis Dane was a nut.

31
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,340
He drove his car into a lake.

32
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,911
He was crazy.

33
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:04,105
They find the body yet?

34
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:06,173
No, just the car.

35
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:10,548
And a note that said:
''Chance favors the prepared mind.''

36
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:11,917
Odd, huh?

37
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:14,921
But then, so was Dane.

38
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:17,887
Captains, you did a hell of a job.

39
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:19,994
Be proud of yourselves.

40
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:21,594
Enjoy your weekend.

41
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,099
Thank you, General.

42
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:25,261
Can l talk to you? Excuse me.

43
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,128
Have a nice weekend.

44
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:29,264
Go home.

45
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:33,266
There's an air show at
the Air Force Academy this weekend.

46
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:36,342
Maybe you'd like to join me for a drink?

47
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,614
Check out the new technologies.

48
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:43,353
All the top brass will be there.
Who knows...

49
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:45,687
...it might help your career.

50
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,358
Sorry, l have plans.

51
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,951
Yeah, sure, l understand.

52
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:53,292
Like the general said...

53
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,632
...you did a good job.

54
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:58,130
Thank you...

55
00:05:58,703 --> 00:05:59,965
...sir.

56
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:15,244
Let's go, you're running late.

57
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:22,584
Where have you been?

58
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:28,260
On a special op?

59
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,731
Lieutenant, always a pleasure.

60
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:32,929
l know, you can't tell me.

61
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,198
Sorry to hear about your brother.

62
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,037
Me, too.

63
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:43,137
We must hurry to make that train.
lt leaves in 45 minutes.

64
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:46,116
Why are you two taking
a train to California?

65
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:48,414
Would you fly if your parents died
in a plane crash?

66
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:49,953
Hi, Casey.

67
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,558
This place runs better when you're here.
l can run it, but....

68
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:57,160
You can't cook.

69
00:06:57,295 --> 00:07:00,958
The patrons come here for you, Casey,
not for me.

70
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,028
Cute kid.

71
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:10,568
-ls that your niece?
-Yes. She's the only family l have.

72
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:13,604
l don't know if l'll recognize her.

73
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:18,275
Come on, we'll miss that train.

74
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:21,283
l missed my brother's funeral, so...

75
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:23,283
...we won't miss the train.

76
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,090
Your attention, please.

77
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:32,062
The Grand Continental Service from
Denver to Los Angeles, now boarding.

78
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:13,527
Has a Sarah Ryback picked up any tickets?

79
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:15,534
Uncle Casey.

80
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,036
Nice to see you, too.

81
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,244
You've gotten big.

82
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:23,473
A lot can happen in five years.

83
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,640
Just a moment.

84
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:29,480
So, what have you been doing?

85
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:35,318
Taking care of airplane crashes,
funerals, stuff like that.

86
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,551
Yeah, so....

87
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,863
Here you are. Track 3.

88
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:55,078
You know, l was thinking....

89
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,207
l remembered that you collect
teddy bears and l got you one.

90
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,751
lt isn't as good as some of yours are...

91
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:05,419
...and l know you may be too mature...

92
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:08,091
...to hang out with teddy bears now.

93
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:10,852
But it's the thought that counts.

94
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:12,188
Thanks.

95
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,428
l guess l'm not trained for this.

96
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:23,364
Excuse me.

97
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:28,106
Can l carry your bags? Oh, nice...

98
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,607
...medal you got there.

99
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:32,144
lt's a Navy Cross.

100
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:34,708
My uncle was in the Navy,
but he's not like you.

101
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:37,050
-What is that?
-This?

102
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:38,419
lt's mace.

103
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,124
All right. Listen, l have to look busy,
so why don't you let me take your bag?

104
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:45,128
lf l don't, l could get fired.

105
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:49,292
lf l get fired, l won't have enough money
for college, and l'll be poor.

106
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,399
This will work. l like this.

107
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,038
What compartment did you say
you were in?

108
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:57,134
My compartment.

109
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:09,636
Captain Gilder...

110
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,645
...fancy meeting you here.

111
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,918
Have some champagne, Captain Trilling.

112
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,153
Good things come to those who wait.

113
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:28,563
Okay, you waited.

114
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,391
Colorado Air Base, this is
Chopper Whiskey Bravo requesting....

115
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:56,452
Hold it!

116
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,056
l was wondering
what that girl over there's drinking.

117
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:44,125
The girl with the tonic and lime
and bad lD?

118
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:45,565
That's the one.

119
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:53,802
-You're not drinking?
-No.

120
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:56,977
Join me. l don't like drinking alone.

121
00:13:57,115 --> 00:13:59,413
There's no alcohol in that.

122
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:05,153
Yeah, you always knew everything,
anyway.

123
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:09,423
Do you think we could have
a pleasant conversation?

124
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:10,922
Sure.

125
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:15,429
Let's talk about why you
and my dad stopped talking.

126
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:18,657
Listen...

127
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:22,832
...l know that your father and l
had our differences.

128
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:27,069
But that doesn't mean
l didn't love him.

129
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:28,840
But you didn't even talk.

130
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:33,475
Time goes by...

131
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:37,516
...it seems to fly,
and before you know it...

132
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:39,712
...things happen.

133
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,490
But l never thought...

134
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,895
...l'd never get a chance
to straighten things out with him.

135
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:51,292
You know...

136
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:55,931
...he didn't get the medals in the service
by being a choirboy.

137
00:14:58,342 --> 00:15:01,175
l don't want you to talk
about my father that way.

138
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,145
l need a drink.

139
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:14,250
What's the strongest stuff you got?

140
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:17,520
How about Puerto Rican rum?

141
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,024
Uncle Casey....

142
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,768
l don't want to fight.

143
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:32,699
l just promised myself that before
l got here, l would tell you how l felt.

144
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:35,105
Now...

145
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,278
...let's just be friends.

146
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:41,114
Okay.

147
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:43,220
l'm going for a walk.

148
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:00,964
-What's up?
-What's in there?

149
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:04,633
lt's top secret.
l can't let you get in there.

150
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:05,673
What's in there?

151
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:09,804
Don't make me restrain you,
because l've been working out, see?

152
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:12,182
lt'd be easy to do that.

153
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,808
Okay. Restrain me.

154
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:16,243
You want me to?

155
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,252
Yeah.

156
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:20,585
All right, if you say so.
lt's gonna be real easy.

157
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:28,721
There's a mop...

158
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,667
...a broom and a lot of smelly stuff
you want to avoid.

159
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,407
Who taught you that?

160
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:42,103
When l was 1 1 years old, my uncle
taught me all this really neat stuff.

161
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:44,613
The dude that's with you?

162
00:16:45,683 --> 00:16:46,650
Yeah...

163
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:48,274
...l guess.

164
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:55,889
l can do that.

165
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:03,390
What are you writing?

166
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:06,934
lt's a book. My memoirs,
stuff like that.

167
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:10,668
Aren't you too young
to be writing your memoirs?

168
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:18,238
l know it's against the rules,
but give me a shot of something.

169
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:20,540
Can you put those up there?

170
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:22,043
Yeah.

171
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:25,818
What's up with that niece of yours,
Miss Bruce Lee?

172
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,720
She almost killed me.

173
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,990
Up!

174
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:33,159
You taught her all that shit?

175
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:35,327
l taught her a few things.

176
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,731
She's lucky she's a girl.

177
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:40,264
l know a little of that stuff, myself.

178
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:41,828
That's what l hear.

179
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,237
From you, but that's what l hear.

180
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:48,478
Don't give him the brandy.
l need it for the cake.

181
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:56,848
Look at that.

182
00:17:56,921 --> 00:18:00,652
Because the train is rocking,
it's cramping my style.

183
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:05,057
l'm making this for Sarah
because it's her favorite thing.

184
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:18,802
Fifteen minutes, on high.

185
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:21,072
The rest is up to God.

186
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:23,840
Now, go find Sarah,
and we'll surprise her.

187
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,383
What was that?

188
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:33,150
lt's called a...

189
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:34,319
...orgasm.

190
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:38,092
Sounds like torpedoes.
We must be in dark territory.

191
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,059
What the hell is this?

192
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,156
They're not our guys.

193
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:55,041
What's the trouble?

194
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:56,770
What's going on?

195
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:58,746
Someone's been shot.

196
00:18:58,949 --> 00:18:59,973
Where?

197
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,021
Here. Loco secured.

198
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:13,430
Move! You have four minutes.

199
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,713
Everybody to the back of the train!
Don't make me ask twice!

200
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,793
Everybody up those stairs! Move it!
Come on!

201
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:53,403
Shut that bitch up, or l will!
Let's go!

202
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:55,901
Get up the stairs!

203
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:08,476
What the fuck is this? Anything else?
Go! Get out of here!

204
00:20:19,864 --> 00:20:21,923
Open the door to the baggage car!

205
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:29,767
Check the baggage.

206
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:35,340
Baggage checked.

207
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:42,118
Any other heroes?

208
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:56,796
One casualty in the dining car.

209
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,502
Take cover!

210
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,753
Four cooks. Check.

211
00:21:21,826 --> 00:21:24,886
Copy that. Continue with the cleanup.

212
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:43,575
We leave in 20 seconds.

213
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:46,907
This, l'm trained for.

214
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,643
Oh, my God.

215
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:56,751
Well, here you are.

216
00:22:57,454 --> 00:23:00,855
The last place anyone would expect
to find you.

217
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:02,652
Amazing.

218
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:14,595
Put something on.

219
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:26,044
Have a seat, Captains.

220
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:33,546
They said you were dead.

221
00:23:33,624 --> 00:23:35,114
Yeah, very restful.

222
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:37,126
No phone calls.

223
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:43,625
You two have been very naughty.

224
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:48,462
ATAC has strict rules against employees
getting involved with each other.

225
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,370
ls that what this is about?

226
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:55,374
Yeah, right. l faked my own death
and hijacked a passenger train...

227
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:58,142
...because l care about who you fuck.

228
00:23:58,248 --> 00:24:01,479
No, l wondered what other rules
you'd be willing to break.

229
00:24:02,553 --> 00:24:04,487
Online transmission's ready, sir.

230
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:06,045
Don't go away.

231
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:11,557
Good evening, everyone.
This is your captor speaking.

232
00:24:11,862 --> 00:24:15,320
There's been a slight change
in your travel plans, tonight.

233
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:19,591
You have, you will note, been moved
to the last two cars of the train...

234
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:21,500
...for your own well-being.

235
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:25,531
First, l'd like to call your attention
to the highly trained men...

236
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:28,007
...with the automatic weapons.

237
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:32,674
ln the event of an emergency,
they may be called upon to shoot you.

238
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:36,177
Your safety is our primary concern.

239
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:39,212
However, if you try anything stupid...

240
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:42,787
...federal regulations require that l kill you.

241
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:44,155
He's insane.

242
00:24:44,228 --> 00:24:46,025
So please...

243
00:24:46,096 --> 00:24:47,688
...no hero shit.

244
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:10,584
Your access code, please.

245
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:12,617
l'll never...

246
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,417
...give you the code.

247
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,126
The psychological profile we have on you
says you will.

248
00:25:19,463 --> 00:25:22,762
However, if you wish to prove
the profile incorrect...

249
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,700
...sit back and see what happens
when an intensely hot needle...

250
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,239
...penetrates the lens of one
of the most beautiful eyes on earth.

251
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:35,775
The needle point will pass through
the lens with very little difficulty.

252
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:38,905
The heat will cauterize
and seal the wound.

253
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:42,246
But the instrument will continue
to transfer heat...

254
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:44,411
...to the fluid in the eyeball.

255
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:48,549
The fluid comes to a boil and...

256
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,252
...the eyeball, itself...

257
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:51,589
...explodes.

258
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:54,821
J-B-N-1...

259
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:57,594
...2-1.

260
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:01,265
He can't use it.

261
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:04,171
Why do you think he's doing this?

262
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:06,434
Because he's crazy.

263
00:26:06,743 --> 00:26:09,268
You can argue it later. Next!

264
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,347
Are we up for this?

265
00:26:12,216 --> 00:26:16,346
You can't hack into the system.
There are quadruple blocks.

266
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,854
Even if he could, the codes
need to be entered simultaneously.

267
00:26:21,258 --> 00:26:25,126
There's not enough power here.
You've seen the ATAC generators.

268
00:26:27,698 --> 00:26:30,292
Oh, for Christ's sake, it's impossible!

269
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,197
You know that!

270
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:35,397
The codes are different!
You can't use them anymore!

271
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:38,202
lt's no good! He can't use them!

272
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:43,378
For God sake, please, give him the code!
Give him the code!

273
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:45,506
E-U-l...

274
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:47,810
...4-7-6.

275
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:15,841
l not only invented Grazer,
l've updated it...

276
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:21,180
...to use part of the electromagnetic
spectrum ATAC is only dimly aware of.

277
00:27:21,251 --> 00:27:22,718
What is that?

278
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:27,183
As long as we're moving,
the signal is completely transparent.

279
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,883
As you can see...

280
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,925
...we're on a choo-choo.
No stop signs for six hours.

281
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,197
ATAC would kill
to get a hold of this technology.

282
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,460
ln fact...

283
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:39,760
...l'm sure they'll try.

284
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:51,344
Works just as well underground,
underwater.

285
00:28:05,996 --> 00:28:08,123
l not only designed the system...

286
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:09,832
...l designed the blocks.

287
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:14,466
What're you doing, Dane?

288
00:28:15,272 --> 00:28:17,706
l'm hacking into ATAC, Linda.

289
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:19,536
Now...

290
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,870
...watch...

291
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:22,306
...this.

292
00:28:35,892 --> 00:28:37,553
lt's mine again.

293
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:00,774
Shut the fuck up!

294
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:03,550
We're locked.

295
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:06,552
Oh, they're still here.

296
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,716
l don't need them anymore.
They can go now.

297
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:14,594
Move it!

298
00:29:14,998 --> 00:29:16,761
Come on, gorgeous.

299
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,331
Don't you know that man's crazy?
Do you realize...?

300
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:22,304
He's paying me a lot of money.

301
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:23,669
That's why?

302
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:46,059
Goddamn it.

303
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:53,894
Three hundred thousand pages
of code...

304
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:57,398
...or 60 minutes of triple-X interactive...

305
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:00,476
...rubber and leather bondage porno.

306
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:05,371
Technology can be used for beauty...

307
00:30:07,217 --> 00:30:08,616
...or debasement.

308
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:10,785
And until you plug it in...

309
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:12,218
...you just can't tell.

310
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:15,820
Oh, gee....

311
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:18,552
l seem to have brought
the targeting codes.

312
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:29,435
l want every window and door
locked and secured. Airtight.

313
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:36,000
Shit.

314
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:42,609
The train is secure.

315
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:46,220
The major installation is T-minus 10.
The phone lines are two.

316
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:49,520
We're sweeping the train for stragglers.
Excuse me.

317
00:31:04,274 --> 00:31:05,673
Okay, people...

318
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:07,538
...let's start the party.

319
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,887
What's going on?!

320
00:31:19,656 --> 00:31:21,453
Captain, give me a report.

321
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:23,219
l'm still searching.

322
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:26,257
Try this.

323
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,490
-What is it?
-lt's gone, sir.

324
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:30,860
-What's gone?
-Grazer 1 .

325
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:34,962
What do you mean, it's gone?
Bring it up on the screen.

326
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:36,967
lt's like someone took it.

327
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,937
How could someone take it?

328
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,939
Nobody knows it's there.

329
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:44,945
-Find the damn thing.
-We designed it to be undetectable.

330
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:47,482
But not from us, for Christ's sake!

331
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:51,585
l want a full systems-check,
and l want it in two minutes.

332
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:53,913
We're in Code 2 status.

333
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:54,954
Code 2.

334
00:31:55,025 --> 00:31:58,586
Gilder, Trilling and Tom Breaker, A.S.A.P.

335
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:00,926
All right, let's move it!

336
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:04,461
Mr. Penn, ATAC is now locked out
of their own system.

337
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:07,594
Grazer 1 is fully under my control.

338
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:14,706
l thought you were
those ugly men with guns.

339
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:17,403
What are you doing?

340
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:20,882
lt was just a nice day for a stroll.
What's in here?

341
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:24,180
lt's the baggage room, but don't go in.
They shot at me.

342
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:26,048
What are you doing?

343
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:27,814
Trying to be killed?

344
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:29,925
They have guns out there.

345
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:31,619
Come here.

346
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:35,821
-l ain't coming out there.
-Don't make me yell. Come here.

347
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:37,263
lnvestors on the line?

348
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:40,667
Clients from Asia and the Middle East
are standing by, sir.

349
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:42,198
Gentlemen.

350
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:46,504
How are we today? How's the weather
out there? Sunny and sandy?

351
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,577
Now, look, it's demonstration time.

352
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:51,944
Some of you have trouble
with the idea of...

353
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:55,246
...a non-terrestrially originated
seismic event.

354
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,580
But l want you to watch China
very closely for the next 10 minutes.

355
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:02,620
-What's the problem?
-The system won't let us in.

356
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:05,525
The system? What do you mean?
We are the system.

357
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:08,598
-Any word from Gilder and Trilling?
-We're still looking.

358
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:10,132
You lose them, too?

359
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,660
Now the shit will really start to fly.
A fertilizer plant in Guangzhou.

360
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:17,606
A fertilizer plant?

361
00:33:17,741 --> 00:33:21,768
Yeah, l'm going to shock the world
by spreading ''caca'' all over the place.

362
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:26,644
Guangzhou is a chemical weapons plant
posing as a fertilizer plant.

363
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:29,207
We know this.
The Chinese know we know.

364
00:33:29,553 --> 00:33:33,580
But we pretend we don't,
and the Chinese pretend we don't...

365
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:34,851
...but they know.

366
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:36,256
Everybody knows.

367
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:41,596
l'm gonna pull the brake cord,
stop the train and get the hell out of here.

368
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:43,891
l'm going to die. l'm a porter.

369
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,558
You're a fucking cook.

370
00:33:45,735 --> 00:33:48,898
You gotta trust me on this one, okay?

371
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:52,671
ls there a phone or com unit here?

372
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:57,838
There's a radio in the locomotive
and a pay phone downstairs in the lounge.

373
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:00,043
l'll try to call the cavalry.

374
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:05,383
Meanwhile, search the bags for a weapon
or something that can be used as one.

375
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:08,057
l even touch a bag, l lose my job.

376
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:09,852
l'm more concerned...

377
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:13,621
...about the lives of these people
being held hostage.

378
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:15,723
The hostages.

379
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:17,460
l don't want them hurt.

380
00:34:23,473 --> 00:34:26,067
Now, pay close attention, Mr. Penn.

381
00:34:26,343 --> 00:34:30,677
l'm about to make the Bhopal disaster
look like a Girl Scout picnic.

382
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,608
There. lt's back.

383
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:37,919
You see, it's nothing. A minor glitch.

384
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:39,419
False alarm.

385
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:43,358
What the hell is that?

386
00:34:43,426 --> 00:34:46,190
Poison gas, chemical fire...

387
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:49,622
...total devastation for a 100-mile radius.

388
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:52,165
Thousands of people are going to die.

389
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,834
Listen and do what l say.

390
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,495
Cover and concealment...

391
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:58,734
...you know as much as anybody!

392
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:00,272
Right.

393
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:02,436
Take that white jacket off.

394
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:07,641
You touch me again, that's your ass.

395
00:35:07,717 --> 00:35:08,979
Targeting codes.

396
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:11,953
-They've started our sequence.
-lt's arming.

397
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:15,521
This is nuts. There's got to be
some kind of malfunction.

398
00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:17,716
lt's being controlled elsewhere.

399
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:21,162
Oh, Jesus, the target's mainland China.

400
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:23,531
Not China!

401
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,233
Not somebody nuclear.

402
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:26,734
What's going on?

403
00:35:37,747 --> 00:35:38,736
Sweet Jesus!

404
00:35:38,815 --> 00:35:40,976
She's into acquisition mode.

405
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:42,812
Somebody shut it down!

406
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,746
They fired me.

407
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:45,719
Took everything.

408
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:47,347
She's powering up for a hit.

409
00:35:47,424 --> 00:35:49,415
Said the technology wasn't essential.

410
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:50,220
Blow it!

411
00:35:50,293 --> 00:35:51,817
Shut it down!

412
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:54,821
No response.

413
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:56,798
They want it! They'll get it!

414
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,413
That's what Dane used to say.

415
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,754
Call Admiral Bates at the Pentagon.

416
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:27,988
Admiral Bates is here in Colorado
attending an air show.

417
00:36:28,932 --> 00:36:30,832
Then get him here, now.

418
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:47,740
Gentlemen, as you can see, it works.

419
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:07,834
This is a one time offer.

420
00:37:08,104 --> 00:37:11,369
Two hundred feet below the Pentagon,
is an itty-bitty crack...

421
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:14,774
...which l propose to make
great, big and wide.

422
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:18,177
Directly above it
is a strike-hard nuclear reactor.

423
00:37:18,948 --> 00:37:20,779
lt ain't hard enough.

424
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:23,343
We'll take out the Pentagon...

425
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,953
...and God...

426
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:26,212
...Allah...

427
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:28,052
...and the wind's willing...

428
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:31,287
...Washington and most of
the eastern seaboard as well.

429
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:43,795
The fee:

430
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,301
One billion dollars.

431
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:48,376
A billion dollars.

432
00:37:50,914 --> 00:37:52,279
l owe people money.

433
00:37:52,882 --> 00:37:53,940
Oh, shit.

434
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,812
What is this place?

435
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:56,817
Here we go.

436
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:59,047
l don't know, nor does Congress.

437
00:38:00,423 --> 00:38:02,323
What the hell is going on?!

438
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:05,624
Don't say this is a weather station.

439
00:38:05,728 --> 00:38:07,355
Bring the rendering up.

440
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:11,624
Recently we deployed
a particle beam weapon into orbit.

441
00:38:11,835 --> 00:38:13,393
ln English, please.

442
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:18,007
lt's a major cash cow. Particle beam
technology, it's the earthquake deal.

443
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:20,937
lt's my understanding
we shut that program down.

444
00:38:23,112 --> 00:38:24,579
We financed it.

445
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:26,179
Breaker, what...?

446
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:29,549
This goddamn thing works now?

447
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:31,717
lt works so effectively...

448
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:35,882
...that if we targeted the Los Angeles
fault lines, in 15 seconds...

449
00:38:36,793 --> 00:38:39,159
...Arizona would be beachfront property.

450
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:41,559
The problem is, someone else
is commanding the satellite.

451
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:44,191
We couldn't find it or destroy it...

452
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:47,866
...so we were unable to stop it.

453
00:38:48,137 --> 00:38:49,570
Oh, my God!

454
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:51,100
China's earthquake?

455
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:53,074
We have full deniability.

456
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:54,470
Holy shit!

457
00:38:54,544 --> 00:38:55,977
That's typical.

458
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,640
Typical Agency bullshit!
Do you know who we're dealing with?

459
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:04,076
We think it's Travis Dane,
the guy who designed the system.

460
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:06,083
-One of our people?
-Not anymore.

461
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:09,283
He was decommissioned.
Last month he was an apparent suicide.

462
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,489
He's brilliant. He can do anything
he puts his mind to, but he's crazy.

463
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:16,258
Why would you hire a maniac?

464
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:17,596
Because...

465
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:21,493
...sane people do not build
weapons like this.

466
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,272
You'd think we'd learn from that.

467
00:39:28,912 --> 00:39:31,176
All right, we're upgrading to Code 3.

468
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:34,682
Gentlemen, let's find the satellite,
and the bastard, now!

469
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:11,984
No power.

470
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:20,027
Cover and conceal.
You know about that, right?

471
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:22,463
You know about that, right?

472
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:40,845
One of our customers has
a personal favor to ask.

473
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,512
He wants you to blow up an airplane.

474
00:40:43,586 --> 00:40:47,147
Tell him to forget about it.
l'm going to blow up the Pentagon.

475
00:40:47,256 --> 00:40:49,417
He either gets on board
or gets left behind.

476
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:53,019
But, sir, the gentleman's ex-wife
is on board of this jet.

477
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:01,536
He wants you to blow up a jet plane
going 500 miles an hour...

478
00:41:01,604 --> 00:41:05,199
...with a weapon designed
for subterranean strikes?

479
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:08,941
He says he'll pay us
an additional $100 million.

480
00:41:11,214 --> 00:41:12,203
Really?

481
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:15,109
What are its transponder numbers?

482
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:17,041
Sending them now.

483
00:41:19,288 --> 00:41:20,312
l can do this.

484
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,791
His ex-wife is history
when the money is in our account.

485
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,355
Grazer 1 will be in position in....

486
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:30,288
He has five minutes to make the deposit.

487
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:47,611
The money's in Zurich...

488
00:41:47,683 --> 00:41:48,479
...now!

489
00:41:48,551 --> 00:41:50,712
Good. Here we go.

490
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,552
Grazer's back online.

491
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:03,631
-lf they hooked up, we're in trouble.
-Pegasus C Team is in range.

492
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:07,225
We have a B-2 bomber
with two anti-satellite missiles on board.

493
00:42:13,509 --> 00:42:15,841
l thought you cut the power downstairs.

494
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:48,474
Pegasus locked on Grazer 1.
On your command.

495
00:42:48,644 --> 00:42:49,702
Fire.

496
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:02,223
Can we get it before it fires?

497
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,815
They are so slow.

498
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:22,907
-Why is it counting?
-Still getting the feed.

499
00:43:30,586 --> 00:43:32,178
Boom!

500
00:43:32,855 --> 00:43:35,187
Earthquake in midair.

501
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:38,922
That is the goddamnedest thing
l've ever seen.

502
00:43:41,764 --> 00:43:44,198
What the hell did we shoot down?

503
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:04,349
l'll ask you again, if we did not
shoot down Grazer 1, what did we shoot?

504
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,226
Check on Herb, downstairs.

505
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:27,269
Train noise eliminated
from the transmission.

506
00:44:27,944 --> 00:44:29,935
Let's get ready to call home.

507
00:44:30,313 --> 00:44:31,575
What's up?

508
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:33,838
-Where'd you get the gun?
-Get anything?

509
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,850
Fishing rod, pool cue, clothes.

510
00:44:35,918 --> 00:44:37,749
You're a useless bastard.

511
00:44:37,987 --> 00:44:41,252
Encrypted, no good.
This is a .45, okay?

512
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:51,592
Dynamic tension, left hand, right hand,
palms pressed together, okay?

513
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:54,827
Cover your ass, 12, 3, 6, 9,
wherever you look always.

514
00:44:55,004 --> 00:44:58,440
Never look in a direction
where the gun ain't pointing, understand?

515
00:45:05,047 --> 00:45:06,674
Who the hell is that?

516
00:45:06,782 --> 00:45:08,340
Jesus Christ!

517
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:12,777
Not quite, General Cooper, although
l have sort of risen from the dead.

518
00:45:13,022 --> 00:45:15,616
No, it's just your old friend,
Travis Dane.

519
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:18,453
You remember? The guy you fired?!

520
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:22,294
And l bet now
you're probably asking yourselves:

521
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:24,965
''W hat the hell did we just shoot down?''

522
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:26,427
The answer is:

523
00:45:26,502 --> 00:45:30,962
The NSA's best and only functional
real-time down-looking satellite...

524
00:45:31,274 --> 00:45:32,866
...the NSP-1 .

525
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:37,638
You'll probably be calling them
any minute now, asking them for its use.

526
00:45:37,813 --> 00:45:41,271
Unfortunately, since even they don't know
where it is...

527
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,908
...they can't help you.

528
00:45:42,985 --> 00:45:44,452
Have you got him?

529
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,019
l'm closing in.

530
00:45:46,088 --> 00:45:49,489
You do know where
the last transmission came from.

531
00:45:49,558 --> 00:45:51,685
You're probably closing in fast...

532
00:45:51,927 --> 00:45:53,724
...on Grazer 1's location.

533
00:45:58,934 --> 00:46:00,663
lt's in there somewhere...

534
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:04,896
...hiding among those 50 ghost satellites
l've created...

535
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:07,001
...just for you.

536
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:11,374
Motherfucker's gone.

537
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:15,577
As my demonstration just proved...

538
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:18,077
...Grazer 1 is viable...

539
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:20,582
...and can produce results.

540
00:46:20,756 --> 00:46:23,088
Reproducible results.

541
00:46:23,526 --> 00:46:24,959
And to prove it...

542
00:46:25,027 --> 00:46:28,861
...l'm going to give you
another demonstration.

543
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:30,756
ln 45 minutes...

544
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:34,594
...as soon as Grazer 1
is in position for a clear shot...

545
00:46:35,004 --> 00:46:38,599
...l'm going to hit the Pentagon
with a 98 percent blast.

546
00:46:39,108 --> 00:46:43,545
Enough to fracture the nuclear reactor
you claim you don't have there.

547
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:45,607
You son of a bitch.

548
00:46:45,781 --> 00:46:47,271
We'll have fallout.

549
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:49,111
We'll have devastation.

550
00:46:50,753 --> 00:46:52,448
l've got things to do.

551
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:59,456
l want you to remember:

552
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:02,390
l was smarter than you
before l worked there.

553
00:47:02,898 --> 00:47:05,628
l was smarter than you
while l worked there.

554
00:47:06,068 --> 00:47:08,400
And l'm still smarter than all of you.

555
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:09,868
Au revoir.

556
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,915
He sure didn't go this way.
We would've heard him.

557
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:24,945
What are the odds
of tracking Grazer down in time?

558
00:47:25,187 --> 00:47:27,485
We should check over Paris.

559
00:47:29,492 --> 00:47:31,551
Considering the area we must cover....

560
00:47:31,627 --> 00:47:33,492
That's why it's called ''space.''

561
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:35,655
What that, son? Speak up.

562
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:37,888
Well...

563
00:47:38,234 --> 00:47:39,758
...l was just saying...

564
00:47:39,835 --> 00:47:42,827
...that's why they call it space,
because...

565
00:47:43,506 --> 00:47:45,406
...there's a lot of it.

566
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:47,300
Thank you.

567
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:49,002
Just be quiet, please.

568
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:53,404
Where are you going?

569
00:47:53,516 --> 00:47:54,949
Front of the train.

570
00:47:55,017 --> 00:47:56,575
To look for the radio.

571
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:59,579
Stay out of sight and don't get killed.

572
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,513
Safety off...

573
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:04,181
...dynamic tension...

574
00:48:04,427 --> 00:48:06,156
...aim...shoot.

575
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:10,089
That's their ass now.

576
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:13,593
Do you know what this is?
This is a Navy Cross.

577
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:15,361
lt's awarded for bravery.

578
00:48:15,438 --> 00:48:18,430
This is my father's.
Uncle Casey's got two of them.

579
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:20,939
He's got medals that are so secret...

580
00:48:23,446 --> 00:48:25,880
...he can never show them to anybody.

581
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:28,539
He won't let anything happen to us.

582
00:48:30,553 --> 00:48:32,043
l guess he's a hero.

583
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:11,186
We have an intruder.

584
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,750
Sweep the train.

585
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:14,090
Do a sweep.

586
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:26,994
Found our intruder?

587
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:29,037
Negative. We're still looking.

588
00:50:29,171 --> 00:50:30,570
You clear?

589
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:34,035
Checking.

590
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:39,805
Nothing.

591
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,681
We're clear here.

592
00:50:42,785 --> 00:50:44,582
Have you checked everywhere?

593
00:50:44,687 --> 00:50:46,245
Check on the roof.

594
00:51:08,377 --> 00:51:09,366
What?!

595
00:51:10,879 --> 00:51:11,709
On top!

596
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,213
He's on the roof!

597
00:51:33,902 --> 00:51:35,631
We're under fire!

598
00:51:36,405 --> 00:51:37,736
Go get him.

599
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:13,330
Big guy. He fell off
of one of the first cars.

600
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:15,733
She said he fell over here.

601
00:53:17,473 --> 00:53:19,998
There's blood here. Here!

602
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:35,816
She got him. He fell between
the first car and the locomotive.

603
00:53:35,991 --> 00:53:37,515
ls this a confirmation?

604
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:42,360
He's hamburger. He's probably spread
about halfway across the state.

605
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,264
We got him.

606
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:48,869
But the bastard took out six men.

607
00:53:49,037 --> 00:53:51,699
You stay here, okay? l'm going back.

608
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:53,366
Be careful.

609
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:09,382
You said these men were good.

610
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:11,225
Who was he?

611
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:15,062
What was he doing downstairs?

612
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:17,792
The man is a soldier of fortune freak.

613
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:21,561
Ran a war camp in Alabama.
They sat around playing paint ball.

614
00:54:21,904 --> 00:54:23,633
That's not the whole story.

615
00:54:23,705 --> 00:54:27,641
The relationship between Penn and Dane
resurfaced during Desert Storm.

616
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:30,845
When Dane apparently died,
we pulled surveillance off them.

617
00:54:30,913 --> 00:54:32,904
We're aware of that.

618
00:54:33,248 --> 00:54:35,307
The connection is tenuous.

619
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:38,418
Let me tell you what it really is.

620
00:54:38,587 --> 00:54:42,250
lt's another classic example
of the ClA not doing their homework.

621
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:43,919
Excuse me?

622
00:54:45,594 --> 00:54:49,394
ln the last few years,
Penn developed a network of contacts.

623
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:53,093
North Korea, here,
in particular in the Middle East.

624
00:54:53,235 --> 00:54:58,070
Best guess is this: lf he's hooked up
with Dane, they have the money to do it.

625
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,202
Why did he need power?

626
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,338
The phone!

627
00:55:12,955 --> 00:55:15,549
Call Philippe, tell him to work tomorrow.

628
00:55:15,657 --> 00:55:16,954
Damn it!

629
00:55:18,427 --> 00:55:22,363
On second thought, he worked yesterday.
Call Antoine.

630
00:55:22,631 --> 00:55:24,030
You've been shot.

631
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:27,191
No, there's no bullet.
No bullet in here.

632
00:55:28,136 --> 00:55:30,070
You think this is ''been shot''

633
00:55:30,138 --> 00:55:31,298
This ain't it.

634
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:32,704
Let's see here.

635
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,542
Gigabyte of RAM should do the trick.

636
00:55:37,946 --> 00:55:39,971
We are in. What have we got?

637
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:43,081
''P hone book...

638
00:55:43,151 --> 00:55:44,641
''. ..recipes.

639
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:46,486
''Chicken cannelloni...

640
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:49,319
''. ..fruit salad with crystallized ginger.''

641
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:50,551
Sounds good.

642
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:56,154
Where are we?

643
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:58,062
We're about right there.

644
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:01,568
There, about 200 miles,
is where we come out of the mountain.

645
00:56:01,637 --> 00:56:04,231
We're without phones for four hours?

646
00:56:05,941 --> 00:56:07,499
''R yback's Tactics.''

647
00:56:10,212 --> 00:56:11,907
Casey-fucking-Ryback?

648
00:56:12,014 --> 00:56:13,675
Jesus Christ.

649
00:56:14,182 --> 00:56:16,514
Who's Casey-fucking-Ryback?

650
00:56:16,685 --> 00:56:21,418
Casey Ryback's a former SEAL Team
captain, a counter-terrorist expert.

651
00:56:22,024 --> 00:56:23,514
He was my instructor.

652
00:56:23,592 --> 00:56:25,025
He's the best.

653
00:56:25,093 --> 00:56:26,526
l thought you were.

654
00:56:26,862 --> 00:56:29,023
Did you see the body she shot?

655
00:56:29,197 --> 00:56:32,928
No, just a lot of blood.
lf you get run over by a train--

656
00:56:39,374 --> 00:56:41,274
Did you see the body?!

657
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:42,971
l assumed he was dead.

658
00:56:43,045 --> 00:56:45,275
Assumption is the mother of fuckups.

659
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:49,943
Every man resume a full train search...

660
00:56:50,052 --> 00:56:52,111
...inside and out, car by car.

661
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:56,621
lncluding all AC ducting, all paneling,
the roof, undercarriage.

662
00:56:56,758 --> 00:56:58,885
Absolutely everything!
Right now!

663
00:57:17,412 --> 00:57:18,674
l can do this.

664
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:20,146
l can do this.

665
00:57:21,717 --> 00:57:24,049
You think he's alive?

666
00:57:24,086 --> 00:57:26,247
Until l have confirmation otherwise.

667
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:30,386
What is he doing on my train
besides killing your men?!

668
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:33,325
See if he's traveling with anyone.

669
00:57:36,098 --> 00:57:40,000
You said your million-dollar mercs
would be enough.

670
00:57:40,068 --> 00:57:41,160
They are.

671
00:57:54,116 --> 00:57:56,949
You picked the wrong place
to hang out with your legs spread.

672
00:57:57,019 --> 00:57:59,010
No, l'm hanging on right here.

673
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:23,805
Plus one.

674
00:58:25,414 --> 00:58:27,405
Could be a girlfriend or child.

675
00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:29,316
Could be his wife.

676
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:31,917
A man doesn't call his wife ''plus one.''

677
00:58:31,987 --> 00:58:34,581
So what? You looking for some babe?

678
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,057
Some bait.

679
00:58:42,097 --> 00:58:43,655
What the hell?

680
00:58:44,332 --> 00:58:47,165
This isn't a produce list, this is....

681
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:50,766
Oh, my God.

682
00:59:08,156 --> 00:59:10,681
Who's fucking blood is this?

683
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,303
Go back to the lounge car.
Check the bar downstairs.

684
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,313
What now?

685
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:40,353
What am l doing? l'm making a bomb.

686
00:59:55,403 --> 00:59:57,030
What's he looking for?

687
00:59:57,772 --> 00:59:59,171
Me.

688
01:00:03,044 --> 01:00:04,409
Your lunch?

689
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:07,844
When do l get some action?

690
01:00:08,283 --> 01:00:12,185
We're going to take a bargaining chip
to protect the hostages.

691
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:20,488
l want an evac order for the president,
and senior staff members...

692
01:00:20,562 --> 01:00:23,554
...on an Alpha status now,
and try not to cause a panic.

693
01:00:23,632 --> 01:00:26,863
l don't think we have a chance in hell.

694
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:29,701
Hi, honey. lt's me.

695
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:34,537
l want you to take Jamie, and l want you
to get out of Washington, tonight.

696
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,173
Go to your mother's.

697
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:38,871
Yeah, and...

698
01:00:39,447 --> 01:00:40,607
...honey...

699
01:00:40,749 --> 01:00:42,273
...don't tell anyone.

700
01:01:06,808 --> 01:01:08,070
What's your name?

701
01:01:08,143 --> 01:01:09,974
Zachs. Bobbi Zachs.

702
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:13,905
You're not on the list.

703
01:01:14,616 --> 01:01:16,311
l'm an employee.

704
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:18,910
Where's your uniform?

705
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:23,486
l'm deadheading, getting a free ride.

706
01:01:34,302 --> 01:01:35,701
Navy Cross.

707
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:37,330
Mace.

708
01:01:39,941 --> 01:01:41,272
Not mace...

709
01:01:41,576 --> 01:01:43,237
...pepper spray.

710
01:01:43,311 --> 01:01:46,007
Sold to civilians.
Once you get used to it...

711
01:01:47,515 --> 01:01:49,813
...it just clears the sinuses.

712
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:51,442
Get her and let's go.

713
01:01:51,953 --> 01:01:53,682
Let her go.

714
01:02:00,795 --> 01:02:03,025
Why do you need lighter fluid?

715
01:02:03,365 --> 01:02:05,026
lt's like a detonator.

716
01:02:22,717 --> 01:02:25,049
Okay, Bobby, get in the elevator.

717
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:27,880
l must go beep someone.

718
01:02:30,725 --> 01:02:33,489
lmagine a fire
from New York to Charleston.

719
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:35,830
We can do this.

720
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:06,624
Get a man on the roof!

721
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:09,687
l need two more downstairs
in the next two cars!

722
01:03:10,098 --> 01:03:12,396
The bastard is using the AC ducting!

723
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,127
Computer's down!

724
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:15,861
Computer's down!

725
01:03:16,504 --> 01:03:18,768
You and you, get to the baggage car!

726
01:03:20,075 --> 01:03:21,372
Get him!

727
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:37,756
l got the CD.

728
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:39,521
He's downstairs. Go get him.

729
01:03:39,594 --> 01:03:40,720
Go.

730
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,654
Now.

731
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:50,470
They have the CD!

732
01:03:54,976 --> 01:03:56,409
The targeting CD!

733
01:03:56,511 --> 01:03:58,479
l can't do anything without it!

734
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:07,521
Let's go!

735
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:08,851
Don't shoot the intruder.

736
01:04:08,923 --> 01:04:10,413
He has the CD.

737
01:04:10,992 --> 01:04:12,584
Hold it right there!

738
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:21,167
Give me the CD.

739
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:25,772
They're off the train.

740
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:27,606
Stop the train.

741
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:50,420
Back up.

742
01:05:13,221 --> 01:05:14,654
This train...

743
01:05:14,722 --> 01:05:19,091
...might as well be 20 tons
of scrap metal without that CD.

744
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:30,601
Hold it!

745
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,411
Come on, move!

746
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:42,039
Hook up right here.

747
01:05:44,586 --> 01:05:46,019
Wait here.

748
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:50,181
Safety off...

749
01:05:50,825 --> 01:05:52,588
...dynamic tension....

750
01:05:54,696 --> 01:05:55,526
Ass!

751
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:01,091
lt's the porter.

752
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:07,031
Check the porter!

753
01:06:20,989 --> 01:06:22,513
You cocksucker!

754
01:06:22,657 --> 01:06:24,818
He's got an accomplice!

755
01:06:25,026 --> 01:06:27,119
lt's a porter. We're on to him.

756
01:06:31,132 --> 01:06:32,156
Don't shoot him.

757
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:33,666
He could also have the CD.

758
01:06:33,735 --> 01:06:35,794
Don't put a bullet in it.

759
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:43,741
Tell me about the porter.

760
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:55,082
The CD.

761
01:06:55,423 --> 01:06:56,390
Hand it over.

762
01:06:56,457 --> 01:06:57,617
Down there.

763
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:09,094
Where did he go under the train?

764
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:11,095
Two cars up.

765
01:07:17,278 --> 01:07:18,939
You pricks never learn.

766
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:25,681
Freeze!

767
01:07:26,721 --> 01:07:28,689
Get your damn hands up.

768
01:07:29,057 --> 01:07:31,116
Up where l can see them!

769
01:07:31,626 --> 01:07:33,287
Where's the CD?

770
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:37,298
l ripped my pocket. lt fell out.

771
01:07:37,365 --> 01:07:39,595
Don't bullshit with me.
Show me that CD...

772
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:41,862
...or l'll cap your black ass, bitch!

773
01:07:41,936 --> 01:07:43,198
Empty your pocket.

774
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:44,966
Right now!

775
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,404
All right, man!

776
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:49,476
l'm just a kid. l'm just a kid,
l'm trying to tell you.

777
01:07:49,544 --> 01:07:50,738
-Do it!
-l lost it there.

778
01:07:50,812 --> 01:07:53,076
l ripped my pocket.
Everything fell out.

779
01:07:53,147 --> 01:07:54,910
l've got your ass!

780
01:07:59,821 --> 01:08:01,812
Porter checked.

781
01:08:11,332 --> 01:08:14,165
Chance favors the prepared mind.

782
01:08:18,773 --> 01:08:20,673
Oh, shit.

783
01:08:27,815 --> 01:08:30,010
Take us west. Full ahead.

784
01:08:33,688 --> 01:08:34,848
Oh, shit.

785
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:57,108
Your uncle wasn't as good as l thought.

786
01:09:05,787 --> 01:09:08,347
You're back online.
Now, get on with it.

787
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:31,144
We haven't lost anything vital.
l have enough to do this.

788
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:36,480
Houston, Tranquility Base here.
We are now at T-minus 20 minutes...

789
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:37,878
...and...

790
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:39,876
...counting.

791
01:09:40,722 --> 01:09:42,883
That bastard started the countdown.

792
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,386
Williams....

793
01:09:45,827 --> 01:09:50,025
Eliminate orbits that don't offer Grazer
a shot at Washington in 20 minutes.

794
01:09:50,364 --> 01:09:51,626
We must eliminate all of them.

795
01:09:51,699 --> 01:09:54,668
-We only have one Pegasus left.
-We don't need one.

796
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:58,729
On the last one we lock on the satellite
and use the self-destruct.

797
01:10:01,175 --> 01:10:02,642
Make it happen.

798
01:10:02,744 --> 01:10:04,507
Start knocking them off.

799
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:21,092
-We've eliminated 22 possibilities.
-Excellent.

800
01:10:21,262 --> 01:10:22,752
Twenty-three.

801
01:10:23,531 --> 01:10:25,021
A cook has a message.

802
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,458
He says he has a Code 3 message.

803
01:10:27,535 --> 01:10:29,628
Patch him through on the audio.

804
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:39,441
ls Joint Chief of Staff Bates there, please?

805
01:10:39,847 --> 01:10:41,815
This is Admiral Bates speaking.

806
01:10:41,983 --> 01:10:45,214
Sir, l have a fax message for you.

807
01:10:45,353 --> 01:10:46,786

-Get me the exact location of that train.

816
01:11:12,747 --> 01:11:13,975

817
01:11:14,048 --> 01:11:15,310
Casey Ryback.

818
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:18,817
Casey Ryback?
Casey Ryback's on this train?

819
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,478
What is he doing?

820
01:11:20,822 --> 01:11:22,312
Leave it to Casey.

821
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:25,482
On vacation with his niece, sir.

822
01:11:32,934 --> 01:11:35,164
What's the closest air strike group?

823
01:11:35,303 --> 01:11:37,771
Stealth, sir, from the air show.

824
01:11:37,839 --> 01:11:39,431
Get them on their way.

825
01:11:39,607 --> 01:11:41,507
There's over 200 people on that train.

826
01:11:41,576 --> 01:11:44,409
There are over eight million people
in Washington.

827
01:11:44,478 --> 01:11:49,142
Unless Ryback performs a miracle
in 18 minutes, l have no choice.

828
01:11:50,785 --> 01:11:52,446
Scramble the Stealth's.

829
01:12:26,921 --> 01:12:28,320
l'm disappointed.

830
01:12:29,323 --> 01:12:32,690
l looked forward to going head-to-head
with the great Casey--

831
01:12:46,974 --> 01:12:48,669
Man, that was good.

832
01:12:52,346 --> 01:12:53,904
Did he teach you that?

833
01:12:55,349 --> 01:12:56,509
Pity...

834
01:12:59,353 --> 01:13:02,254
...you could have been very, very good.

835
01:13:04,525 --> 01:13:06,686
She's insurance, leave her alone.

836
01:13:07,028 --> 01:13:08,928
Ryback's gone, Dane.

837
01:13:10,498 --> 01:13:12,056
Did you see the body?

838
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:16,426
Assumption is the mother of all fuckups.

839
01:13:17,038 --> 01:13:19,438
lt doesn't matter, she'll die anyway...

840
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:22,369
...with all the rest.

841
01:13:25,046 --> 01:13:27,708
Ryback may be dead, he may be alive...

842
01:13:28,716 --> 01:13:31,207
...but he is not on this train.

843
01:14:16,764 --> 01:14:19,665
l shouldn't have got back on this train.

844
01:14:23,037 --> 01:14:24,436
Drop the gun.

845
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:26,428
Drop it!

846
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:38,279
l never considered myself vicious...

847
01:14:38,619 --> 01:14:39,916
...but you...

848
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:42,021
...you're like a cockroach!

849
01:14:43,524 --> 01:14:46,288
So what do you do
when the bastard shows himself?

850
01:14:47,028 --> 01:14:48,689
You squash him, right?

851
01:14:50,398 --> 01:14:52,798
You get what l'm saying here, busboy?

852
01:14:54,135 --> 01:14:55,466
l'm a porter...

853
01:14:55,636 --> 01:14:57,297
...not a busboy.

854
01:14:58,205 --> 01:15:00,196
Okay, Mr. Porter...

855
01:15:02,043 --> 01:15:04,034
...you got balls, man.

856
01:15:04,145 --> 01:15:06,136
So l'm going to let you decide.

857
01:15:08,215 --> 01:15:10,046
You want to see it coming...

858
01:15:12,553 --> 01:15:14,316
...or to turn around?

859
01:15:17,058 --> 01:15:18,150
Say...

860
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,493
...want to help me?

861
01:15:32,073 --> 01:15:33,165
Shit.

862
01:15:33,407 --> 01:15:35,238
You're a bad motherfucker.

863
01:15:35,409 --> 01:15:37,570
Let's go kick some more ass, though.

864
01:15:44,118 --> 01:15:45,779
Cool, man.

865
01:15:47,288 --> 01:15:49,415
Congratulations, gentlemen...

866
01:15:49,757 --> 01:15:51,725
...there is now one billion dollars...

867
01:15:51,792 --> 01:15:55,592
...waiting for us in the land of banks,
cheese and cuckoo clocks.

868
01:15:56,197 --> 01:15:57,755
All we must do now...

869
01:15:58,032 --> 01:16:00,193
...is blow up Washington, D.C.

870
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:01,857
That'd be the fire.

871
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:05,099
You will be picked up at the next stop.

872
01:16:05,206 --> 01:16:07,367
Thank you for your participation.

873
01:16:11,212 --> 01:16:12,975
lt is sort of true.

874
01:16:16,884 --> 01:16:18,476
You're traveling in another dimension...

875
01:16:18,552 --> 01:16:21,385
...not of sight and sound, but of mind.

876
01:16:21,755 --> 01:16:25,156
There's a signpost up ahead.
Your next stop:

877
01:16:25,259 --> 01:16:27,227
Dark territory.

878
01:16:35,302 --> 01:16:37,566
Who says l have a one-track mind?

879
01:16:48,215 --> 01:16:50,206
The town's on the wrong side.

880
01:16:51,252 --> 01:16:53,413
We're not on the right tracks.

881
01:16:54,188 --> 01:16:56,918
We pass it on the inside,
not the outside.

882
01:16:59,193 --> 01:17:00,888
Where are they taking us?

883
01:17:03,464 --> 01:17:06,262
8:00, Nevada Petrol Express.

884
01:17:06,433 --> 01:17:09,925
We're going to collide.
lf we don't do something, we'll die.

885
01:17:10,171 --> 01:17:12,264
This is a big motherfucker.

886
01:17:12,506 --> 01:17:14,565
lt's six locos up front,
about a mile long...

887
01:17:14,642 --> 01:17:17,440
...and has 800,000 gallons of gasoline.

888
01:17:18,512 --> 01:17:21,174
You won't let them get away with it.

889
01:17:21,682 --> 01:17:24,344
No, l'm going to get my bag of tricks...

890
01:17:25,286 --> 01:17:27,948
...and we are going
to rescue these hostages.

891
01:17:32,293 --> 01:17:34,227
That's the Nevada Petrol Express.

892
01:17:34,295 --> 01:17:37,526
lt's carrying 800,000 gallons of gasoline.

893
01:17:37,831 --> 01:17:39,526
Can't we contact them?

894
01:17:39,767 --> 01:17:42,998
Not as long as they're in dark territory.
There is no reception in the canyons.

895
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:45,470
When will they hit? Will it do the job?

896
01:17:46,173 --> 01:17:49,336
lt's going to be close, but...
l don't think so.

897
01:18:00,421 --> 01:18:03,151
We're closing in, sir,
but there are 1 1 possibles left.

898
01:18:03,324 --> 01:18:05,155
Can you eliminate them in time?

899
01:18:05,226 --> 01:18:06,318
No, sir.

900
01:18:08,996 --> 01:18:11,624
Foxtrot Flight, vectoring in on target.

901
01:18:15,369 --> 01:18:17,166
Green light the bombers.

902
01:18:17,504 --> 01:18:19,472
Roger, Foxtrot heading 0.

903
01:18:23,644 --> 01:18:24,941
God forgive us.

904
01:18:29,883 --> 01:18:31,145
Something's coming in.

905
01:18:31,218 --> 01:18:33,083
lntermittent signal, very faint.

906
01:18:33,153 --> 01:18:34,848
F-1 17s.

907
01:18:35,589 --> 01:18:36,749
Stealth's.

908
01:18:37,358 --> 01:18:39,019
They found us.

909
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:40,921
Casey-fucking-Ryback.

910
01:18:41,095 --> 01:18:42,187
Shoot them down.

911
01:18:42,263 --> 01:18:44,288
l'd have to unlock from Washington.

912
01:18:44,365 --> 01:18:47,698
l don't have the transponder numbers.
l can't target them!

913
01:18:48,102 --> 01:18:50,093
They'd kill all the hostages.

914
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,391
Turbulence.

915
01:19:13,093 --> 01:19:15,152
lf it moves, Grazer can see it.

916
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,621
They disturb the air
as they fly through it.

917
01:19:19,433 --> 01:19:22,732
Low altitude turbulence,
that's how you find these things.

918
01:19:24,004 --> 01:19:25,562
There you are...

919
01:19:25,673 --> 01:19:27,300
...Stealth.

920
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:30,576
l can target these.

921
01:19:32,413 --> 01:19:33,311
Lady!

922
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,745
What's taking you so long?

923
01:19:34,815 --> 01:19:36,646
You've had your two minutes.

924
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:38,741
We're the good guys.

925
01:19:45,326 --> 01:19:47,726
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

926
01:19:48,228 --> 01:19:50,025
-They split up.
-ls that a problem?

927
01:19:50,097 --> 01:19:52,497
l won't get Grazer onto D.C.
before it passes.

928
01:19:52,566 --> 01:19:54,090
Come out now.

929
01:19:54,935 --> 01:19:56,266
l broke my bra.

930
01:20:01,542 --> 01:20:03,169
Tits to die for, huh?

931
01:20:03,777 --> 01:20:04,869
Where are the hostages?

932
01:20:04,945 --> 01:20:06,708
They're upstairs! Go!

933
01:20:11,151 --> 01:20:12,345
You first.

934
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,352
Say good night, Gracie.

935
01:20:21,862 --> 01:20:23,124
Got you.

936
01:21:07,908 --> 01:21:09,842
Ryback's hitting the hostage cars.

937
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:11,571
Good old Ryback!

938
01:21:41,775 --> 01:21:45,040
ATAC, Foxtrot 2.
Target is locked on. l have tone.

939
01:21:54,121 --> 01:21:55,452
Damn, l'm good.

940
01:21:55,622 --> 01:21:56,589
Jesus.

941
01:22:04,965 --> 01:22:06,193
Get me the president.

942
01:22:14,675 --> 01:22:16,870
l'm coming to get my niece now.

943
01:22:22,282 --> 01:22:23,647
Come and get her.

944
01:22:27,221 --> 01:22:29,689
Why are you bringing Ryback here?
Can you handle this?

945
01:22:29,756 --> 01:22:33,817
lt looks like you fucked up.
lt's time to cut and run.

946
01:22:36,997 --> 01:22:38,294
Excuse me?

947
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:51,510
Anyone else think l fucked up?

948
01:22:55,516 --> 01:22:56,540
No.

949
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,015
The cars are separating!

950
01:23:08,595 --> 01:23:09,721
What are you doing?

951
01:23:09,796 --> 01:23:11,263
Coming to help you.

952
01:23:11,331 --> 01:23:12,525
You're a hero now?

953
01:23:12,599 --> 01:23:13,998
You're the hero.

954
01:23:14,468 --> 01:23:15,560
We're free!

955
01:23:22,676 --> 01:23:26,772
You want to help? Climb up that ladder
and commandeer that helo.

956
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,973
Are you crazy? Climb up there?

957
01:23:29,082 --> 01:23:30,674
lt might not work, but try.

958
01:23:30,751 --> 01:23:31,581
Where are you going?

959
01:23:31,652 --> 01:23:32,641
The girl.

960
01:23:33,587 --> 01:23:35,748
Tranquility, this is Sparrow. Over.

961
01:23:35,822 --> 01:23:39,019
This is Tranquility.
Hold position as planned. Out.

962
01:23:44,998 --> 01:23:46,989
Hey, bring that ladder closer.

963
01:23:47,167 --> 01:23:49,727
Can't you see l'm trying to be a hero?

964
01:23:51,905 --> 01:23:53,202
That's better.

965
01:23:59,913 --> 01:24:03,007
This is Sparrow. We made our first pickup.

966
01:24:03,317 --> 01:24:06,252
The hell you have.
Get up there and deal with that.

967
01:24:38,118 --> 01:24:39,676
What's going on?

968
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:45,956
Kick his butt!

969
01:24:56,603 --> 01:24:59,071
Honey, we sure taught
that boy how to fly.

970
01:24:59,706 --> 01:25:00,900
We sure did.

971
01:25:01,241 --> 01:25:04,074
Now we're going to keep
this chopper right here.

972
01:25:04,511 --> 01:25:08,538
Or l'm going to blow your brains out!
You got that, honey?

973
01:26:25,692 --> 01:26:27,717
Let me handle Ryback.

974
01:26:28,762 --> 01:26:30,855
You take care of the techno shit.

975
01:26:32,232 --> 01:26:33,824
He's mine.

976
01:26:36,703 --> 01:26:39,001
l'll take him myself, hand to hand.

977
01:26:39,506 --> 01:26:44,068
Come on my little ghost satellites,
l need you with me to hide my baby...

978
01:26:44,244 --> 01:26:46,906
...so she can blow the fuck
out of Washington.

979
01:26:47,814 --> 01:26:49,748
Go get your throat ripped out.

980
01:26:50,183 --> 01:26:54,085
l got eight million people to kill,
and one billion bucks to pick up.

981
01:27:00,093 --> 01:27:01,492
Thank you, sir.

982
01:27:01,862 --> 01:27:04,262
The president and staff are evacuated.

983
01:27:04,831 --> 01:27:08,267
Leaving millions of innocent people
to die if we don't stop it.

984
01:27:08,435 --> 01:27:10,426
We must use Pegasus now.

985
01:27:10,871 --> 01:27:12,099
But, sir...

986
01:27:15,142 --> 01:27:17,372
...we still have eight possibilities.

987
01:27:20,147 --> 01:27:21,375
Pick one.

988
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:24,607
Now!

989
01:27:26,353 --> 01:27:27,320
Kappa.

990
01:27:27,387 --> 01:27:31,118
Thank you. Kappa's the target.
Stand by and launch.

991
01:27:36,463 --> 01:27:38,897
l've never been afraid of anybody.

992
01:27:40,033 --> 01:27:42,126
But that uncle of yours scares me.

993
01:27:46,206 --> 01:27:47,901
And l like it.

994
01:28:37,958 --> 01:28:40,290
lt's you and me...or me and her.

995
01:29:02,315 --> 01:29:06,411
Now, you hold on real tight
and you'll stay in one piece.

996
01:29:51,364 --> 01:29:53,127
Fuck, you ruined my coat.

997
01:30:03,977 --> 01:30:05,205
Good morning.

998
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,138
Get up!

999
01:31:58,324 --> 01:32:00,485
Nobody beats me in the kitchen.

1000
01:32:10,670 --> 01:32:14,333
l must go. Won't need any of this
anymore. Everything l need...

1001
01:32:15,075 --> 01:32:16,201
...is right here.

1002
01:32:16,276 --> 01:32:18,506
The Petrol Express
will be here in a minute.

1003
01:32:18,578 --> 01:32:20,011
Have a nice life.

1004
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:21,841
What's left of it.

1005
01:32:25,351 --> 01:32:28,115
You take one step
and l'm dropping this grenade.

1006
01:32:33,126 --> 01:32:34,286
Drop it.

1007
01:32:56,216 --> 01:32:57,478
Pegasus missed.

1008
01:32:58,184 --> 01:33:00,209
lt wasn't Kappa.

1009
01:33:00,653 --> 01:33:01,881
Jesus.

1010
01:33:11,998 --> 01:33:13,932
Shooting me won't do any good.

1011
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,730
ATAC can't get past my ghost satellites.

1012
01:33:16,903 --> 01:33:20,168
And you can't get past
my encrypted program.

1013
01:33:20,306 --> 01:33:23,332
You mean to tell me there's no way
l can shut that off?

1014
01:33:23,409 --> 01:33:24,501
No way.

1015
01:33:36,356 --> 01:33:38,517
l never thought of that.

1016
01:33:38,691 --> 01:33:40,022
lt was Delta.

1017
01:33:45,298 --> 01:33:47,129
We're locked on.

1018
01:33:48,668 --> 01:33:49,635
Hit it!

1019
01:34:42,488 --> 01:34:46,481
Hold the ladder at the top of the train.
And keep this chopper right here.

1020
01:35:38,478 --> 01:35:39,706
l never doubted you.

1021
01:35:39,779 --> 01:35:41,474
Oh, yes, you did.

1022
01:35:41,981 --> 01:35:44,882
This is a real sweet
Hallmark moment, but...

1023
01:35:45,652 --> 01:35:48,052
...can we go home now, Uncle Casey?

1024
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:52,986
This is Helo 505 November Mike.

1025
01:35:54,027 --> 01:35:56,587
Sir, there's a message coming in.
l'll patch it through.

1026
01:35:56,663 --> 01:35:57,925
This is Casey Ryback.

1027
01:35:57,997 --> 01:35:59,555
The hostages are safe.
