1
00:01:46,442 --> 00:01:47,272
How's it look?

2
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:49,519
Like a New Mexican shithole.

3
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:51,874
Perfect spot for a nest.

4
00:01:58,362 --> 00:01:59,875
Let's hit it.

5
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:33,315
All right. Gio?

6
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:37,112
Bene dica vow omnipotens deus.

7
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:41,275
In nomine Patrius, et Filius,
et Spiritus Sanctus. Amen.

8
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:44,193
-Everything set?
-Ready, boss.

9
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:46,239
We got a nest
inside this place.

10
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,913
Figure at least six goons,
maybe more.

11
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:51,073
Chances are,
we'll find the master.

12
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:55,520
You find the nest, you find the master.
He usually won't leave it.

13
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,435
It's strictly by the book today.
Questions?

14
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:03,674
Let's get to work.

15
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:05,591
-I'll do it, boss.
-My turn.

16
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,391
Anthony?

17
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:27,473
Easy with that door.
Slow...

18
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:28,918
...and easy.

19
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:30,880
Sorry, boss.

20
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:33,598
Jesus!

21
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:43,000
-What was that?
-I don't know.

22
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:53,237
Did I wake you, Montoya?

23
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:56,711
Relax. Dead body.
Bled out and cold.

24
00:07:56,962 --> 00:07:58,873
Dead body.
Bled out and cold.

25
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,280
Suck it up.

26
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:08,157
Bambi!

27
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,071
Get it off!

28
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:11,960
Wait! Hold your fire!

29
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,874
Get it off now!

30
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:20,076
Now! Fire!

31
00:09:29,322 --> 00:09:31,278
-What?
-I don't know. Hang on.

32
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:36,114
What's going on in there?

33
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:42,351
Big Deyo, what's going on in there?

34
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,798
We got a live one.
Female goon.

35
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:48,394
We'll save her for you.

36
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:53,952
Open wide, baby.

37
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:05,431
Anthony, stick her!

38
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,078
Clear! Take that!

39
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,795
Ortega, we got a fish! Go!

40
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,516
Go from Montoya.

41
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:23,751
We're losing him!

42
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:25,397
Bambi, reload!

43
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:33,681
Shit!

44
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:40,518
Catlin!

45
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:41,638
Safety on, boss!

46
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:43,315
-Got it?
-Clear! Clear!

47
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,318
Oh, Lord.

48
00:10:58,842 --> 00:10:59,831
Take over.

49
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:06,880
Come on! Right here.

50
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:10,878
Die!

51
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:12,475
Die!

52
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,081
Fucking die! Die!

53
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:28,235
Fuck it! Not only ugly,
he smells bad. Jeez!

54
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:29,875
Give me the radio.

55
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,838
-Everybody okay?
-Yeah, boss.

56
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:35,880
Got another one. He's dead.
Send in the cable.

57
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:37,515
Give me a minute.

58
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:41,516
May her soul and the souls
of the departed...

59
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:44,276
...with the mercy of God,
rest in peace.

60
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:45,875
Amen.

61
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:58,071
Nothing like a little head,
eh, Padre?

62
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:09,915
Okay, boys. Time to mop it up.

63
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,074
Deyo, Ortega, Bambi. Upstairs.

64
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:14,721
Catlin, Anthony, Davis.

65
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:16,275
Basement.

66
00:12:34,242 --> 00:12:36,676
Enjoy the barbecue, baby!

67
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,201
One, two, three, four...

68
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:22,761
...five, six, seven, eight...

69
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,880
...nine! Goons, man!

70
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:28,471
It's not a bad day's work.

71
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,158
You the man!

72
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:35,072
What is it, Jack?
Is something wrong?

73
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,042
Yeah. Where was the master?

74
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,671
-Want us to check once more?
-He's not there.

75
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:46,274
You don't suppose
there's another nest, do you?

76
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:49,678
Sure as hell better not be.

77
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:53,271
-Let's get out of here.
-Get the hookers!

78
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:37,195
Thank you for all your help.

79
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:41,117
Father, I've spent two weeks
running whores and buying liquor.

80
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:44,075
-When are they leaving?
-We're clearing out tomorrow.

81
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:46,477
I can't say that
I'm sorry to hear it.

82
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:50,473
You get that little package from us?

83
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:51,917
Yeah, I got it.

84
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,720
Good, then you're happy.

85
00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:55,600
You all work together?

86
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:57,480
That's right.

87
00:14:57,682 --> 00:14:59,274
What do you do?

88
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,200
We kill vampires.

89
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,672
I briefed Rome.
They're wiring a payment.

90
00:15:03,922 --> 00:15:06,311
-Thanks, Gio.
-Cardinal Alba's flying in.

91
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:08,917
-He wants to see you tomorrow.
-It's my day off.

92
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:11,881
Jack. Not anymore.

93
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,280
What happened to the master?

94
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,114
I don't know, Padre.

95
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:19,876
A master won't leave
a nest filled with goons.

96
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:23,074
What says he's in New Mexico?
He could be anywhere.

97
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:26,319
Why would he run? It's not like
he knew we were coming.

98
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:28,439
No, really. What do you guys do?

99
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:31,361
I'm not kidding. We kill vampires.

100
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,035
Tell the lady what we do.

101
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:36,437
Kill vampires. Hunt them down.

102
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:38,553
Kick the shit out of them.

103
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:41,952
Right.

104
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:45,877
I know how you feel, baby.
Nobody believes in vampires.

105
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:50,274
See, the thing is, we know
vampires are stalking the earth.

106
00:15:50,522 --> 00:15:52,478
We also know there's a God too.

107
00:15:52,722 --> 00:15:55,282
We just don't understand him.

108
00:15:56,762 --> 00:15:58,480
Nice party.

109
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:07,077
You look like you got something
other than me on your mind.

110
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,079
Feel like telling me about it?

111
00:16:11,082 --> 00:16:13,232
I was looking for something
I didn't find.

112
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:17,635
That's a pain in the ass.

113
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:26,281
Maybe you should try
looking somewhere else?

114
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:30,471
I can tell you where you
might wanna start.

115
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:33,473
Well, Jesus, you're right.

116
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:37,920
I should've been looking in
a whole different place.

117
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:44,202
So why don't you get me
something to drink?

118
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:47,195
And we can meet back in your...

119
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:49,080
...room.

120
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:57,276
That's the first good idea
I heard today.

121
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:44,077
Deyo, give me a couple beers,
will you?

122
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:50,358
You're magnificent, you know?
Have I ever told you that?

123
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:53,315
-Slow down, Padre.
-No, I'm not drunk.

124
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:56,275
Oh, really?
What are you on, acid?

125
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:28,920
Doesn't it feel beautiful?

126
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:31,871
Something you'll never forget.

127
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,673
I know I won't.

128
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:50,720
I think we're out of beer.

129
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:54,113
I think we ought to
knock over a liquor store.

130
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:57,479
Hell, why not?
I don't give a shit anymore.

131
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:03,397
I got beer.

132
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,519
Got beer in the other room.

133
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:09,675
Fucking people. I don't know why
I gotta take care of everybody.

134
00:19:11,882 --> 00:19:12,792
And you.

135
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:15,678
You. You don't go anywhere.

136
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,677
I got plans for you.

137
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:52,274
Jack Crow.

138
00:21:20,602 --> 00:21:22,718
Quick! The pickup.
Keys!

139
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:26,878
Come on! Come with me!

140
00:21:28,802 --> 00:21:30,155
Did he bite you?

141
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:31,798
Wait!

142
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,515
I'll use you. Come here.

143
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:37,240
Leave her!
She's dead anyway!

144
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:40,121
Just take her.
I can use her. Go!

145
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:49,759
Step on it, goddamn it!

146
00:21:53,842 --> 00:21:55,070
-Hit it!
-I'm going!

147
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:04,476
He's right behind us!

148
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:05,956
Come on! Go!

149
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:15,351
Kill him!

150
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:21,715
You okay?

151
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:30,518
Can you walk?

152
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:33,120
You alive? Come on!

153
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:35,317
Come on.

154
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:38,670
-What are you doing?
-She's going with us.

155
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:41,237
He just bit her!

156
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:42,961
She hasn't turned yet.

157
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:44,555
Well, she's on her way!

158
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,555
It's under 48 hours.
The telepathic link won't hold.

159
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:48,712
So what!

160
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:51,954
She'll start receiving his thoughts,
seeing what he sees!

161
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:54,318
Exactly.
Like a surveillance camera.

162
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:57,156
So we can find him and
shove a stick up his ass!

163
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:01,077
I'm gonna use her to get to the master
and whoever tipped him off.

164
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:03,995
We were set up.
He knew my fucking name!

165
00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:05,715
-Come on.
-Who set us up?

166
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:08,556
I don't know,
but I want the son of a bitch.

167
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:09,751
Can you walk?

168
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:12,516
Wake up! Can you walk?
Are you with me?

169
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:14,756
Come on!

170
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:16,839
Do you hear me? Well?

171
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:20,440
This ain't my first time
to the dance. Let's go.

172
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:07,515
Hey, cowboy!

173
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:10,192
Can I help you?

174
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,676
I'm borrowing your car.

175
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:15,431
Say, "Help yourself."

176
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:18,156
-You want me to say what?
-Shut the fuck up!

177
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:20,518
I'll blow your teeth
out of your head.

178
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:22,121
Back off!

179
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:23,757
Help yourself, boy.

180
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:26,038
Much obliged, partner.

181
00:26:39,802 --> 00:26:40,996
Get in!

182
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:22,715
Take her to Apache Springs.
Plaza Hotel.

183
00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:24,958
Hole up there.
I'll find you soon.

184
00:27:25,882 --> 00:27:29,033
-Dump this thing. Take the Jeep.
-You can't bury them all.

185
00:27:29,922 --> 00:27:30,911
Get going.

186
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:32,675
I need to talk to you!

187
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:34,275
We're wasting time!

188
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:35,955
Rule number seven:

189
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:38,354
Never bury a member
by yourself.

190
00:27:38,602 --> 00:27:39,955
Special circumstances.

191
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:41,915
The team's slaughtered!

192
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:45,074
-I can handle it!
-Bullshit! You know better.

193
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:50,117
Got any bright ideas?

194
00:27:50,322 --> 00:27:53,917
We kill the whore, bury the team
and head back to Monterey.

195
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:02,551
If you wanna pull out...

196
00:28:02,802 --> 00:28:04,633
-...go ahead.
-I didn't say that.

197
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:07,840
The rules changed.
We'll do whatever it takes.

198
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:10,038
We got 11 hours
until sundown.

199
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:12,955
If you got something to say,
spit it out!

200
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:16,478
I got something to say.
Don't take too fucking long!

201
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:21,512
I get nervous
when you're not around.

202
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:50,714
-How you doing? I need a room.
-For how long?

203
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:52,475
A few days.

204
00:31:52,722 --> 00:31:55,555
It's $375 a week.

205
00:31:56,002 --> 00:31:58,675
Plus $25 for your cable TV.

206
00:32:02,802 --> 00:32:06,033
-What's the fucking total, guy?
-That's $400.

207
00:32:06,282 --> 00:32:07,840
Is that your girlfriend?

208
00:32:08,082 --> 00:32:10,516
No, it's my fucking mother.
Give me the key.

209
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:21,716
Come on. Take my arm.

210
00:32:28,802 --> 00:32:31,521
Hey, wake up, will you?
Let's go!

211
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:33,598
Jack Crow.

212
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:37,991
Cerritos at 14th and Santa Fe.
Need immediate pickup.

213
00:32:39,162 --> 00:32:40,720
None of them.

214
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:42,915
I'm alone.

215
00:32:44,082 --> 00:32:45,310
Dead.

216
00:32:46,602 --> 00:32:50,117
Sources report that
all the bodies were decapitated.

217
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:54,470
The heads were found buried
a mile from the murder scene.

218
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,031
The number of dead now stands at 19...

219
00:32:57,282 --> 00:32:59,238
... with police still combing the motel.

220
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:03,441
Of course, we'll be standing by
to bring you any updates.

221
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:52,511
Forget it.

222
00:34:00,402 --> 00:34:01,630
Buon giorno.

223
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:04,561
Come. Please sit down.

224
00:34:09,802 --> 00:34:10,712
Who's this?

225
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:11,951
This is...

226
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:14,113
...Father Adam Guiteau.

227
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:17,753
Father Adam's in charge
of our archives.

228
00:34:18,002 --> 00:34:19,720
A bookworm.

229
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:22,431
He's familiar with all
your activities.

230
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:24,354
So speak freely.

231
00:34:24,602 --> 00:34:26,911
Tell me what happened.

232
00:34:29,122 --> 00:34:30,714
We cleaned out the nest.

233
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:33,161
A master showed up.

234
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:36,952
No master was ever like this.
Superhuman strength. Unkillable.

235
00:34:37,802 --> 00:34:40,999
We didn't stand a chance.
So tell me, cardinal...

236
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:42,914
...but couldn't he be the one?

237
00:34:43,162 --> 00:34:45,437
The one we knew would
come along one day?

238
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:47,513
There are some other developments.

239
00:34:47,762 --> 00:34:50,322
Sad developments.

240
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:52,321
Tom.

241
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:57,110
Our Tom. Our Tom Callahan.
He's dead.

242
00:34:58,402 --> 00:35:01,678
And the whole European team
is wiped out.

243
00:35:01,882 --> 00:35:02,678
When?

244
00:35:02,922 --> 00:35:03,911
Three days ago.

245
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:06,875
Callahan was clearing
a nest near Cologne, Germany.

246
00:35:07,602 --> 00:35:10,912
Local authorities reported it
as a terrorist act.

247
00:35:14,082 --> 00:35:15,674
We found this at the site.

248
00:35:20,762 --> 00:35:22,753
Is he the one?

249
00:35:24,642 --> 00:35:25,836
Yes.

250
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:30,956
What is this?

251
00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:32,557
A celebratum.

252
00:35:32,802 --> 00:35:36,158
It's medieval Latin for "celebrate."
"Celebrate this."

253
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,154
Celebrate what?

254
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:41,557
We don't know.

255
00:35:41,802 --> 00:35:44,441
I've authenticated it.
It was painted in 1340.

256
00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:46,877
The subject's name is- was- Valek.

257
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:50,233
Jan Valek, born in Prague, 1311.
He was a priest...

258
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,155
...who turned against the Church
and led peasants...

259
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:55,956
...in an uprising,
capturing several towns.

260
00:35:56,202 --> 00:35:57,430
Valek was captured.

261
00:35:57,682 --> 00:36:00,242
He was tried for heresy
and burned at the stake.

262
00:36:01,002 --> 00:36:04,631
But after his death
he was seen walking at night.

263
00:36:04,882 --> 00:36:07,157
He killed the living
to drink their blood.

264
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:10,314
They opened his grave,
and it was found empty.

265
00:36:10,562 --> 00:36:13,076
It's the first known case
of vampirism.

266
00:36:13,322 --> 00:36:14,755
A priest.

267
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:18,995
Valek is not like the other masters
you've hunted. He is the first...

268
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:20,317
...and most powerful.

269
00:36:20,522 --> 00:36:24,151
Of our slayers, you are
the only one who faced Valek...

270
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:26,711
...and survived.

271
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:28,881
I'm going back out.

272
00:36:29,162 --> 00:36:30,914
You mind if I hang on to this?

273
00:36:31,162 --> 00:36:34,518
I've been in contact with Rome.
The Vatican Council...

274
00:36:34,762 --> 00:36:37,481
...requests that you rebuild
your team.

275
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:40,555
-There isn't time.
-You're to return to Monterey...

276
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:42,758
...recruit new team members...

277
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:45,516
...and try again when
you are at full strength.

278
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,393
Father Adam will accompany you
and take the place...

279
00:36:49,602 --> 00:36:51,911
...of poor Father Giovanni.

280
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:53,715
I don't think so.

281
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:00,395
This is nonnegotiable.

282
00:37:00,642 --> 00:37:03,759
Valek is the original.
The source of the disease.

283
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:06,391
The first vampire created
by the Church-

284
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:09,480
-By accident.
-Shut the fuck up!

285
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:12,435
This was your fight, cardinal.
Now it is mine.

286
00:37:18,562 --> 00:37:22,840
If you refuse to obey the rules,
the operation will be canceled...

287
00:37:23,082 --> 00:37:24,959
...the funding withdrawn.

288
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:31,360
You have any idea how
this Valek knows my name?

289
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:44,476
Stay close to him.

290
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:50,515
What's your name?

291
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:55,512
Do you understand
what's happened to you?

292
00:38:57,362 --> 00:38:59,114
Help me!

293
00:39:00,562 --> 00:39:02,280
Don't fuck with me, honey!

294
00:39:02,522 --> 00:39:05,320
I'll snap your neck like a twig!

295
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:08,877
Now nod your head yes or no.

296
00:39:09,162 --> 00:39:11,915
Do you understand
what's happened to you?

297
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:13,710
Do it!

298
00:39:15,762 --> 00:39:16,956
All right.

299
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:19,518
Now I'm going to explain it to you.

300
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:23,760
First, I'm gonna take
my hand off your mouth.

301
00:39:24,002 --> 00:39:25,720
You scream....

302
00:39:29,322 --> 00:39:30,516
Good.

303
00:39:36,562 --> 00:39:38,234
What's your name?

304
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:41,434
Katrina.

305
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,600
Okay, Katrina.

306
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,634
Here's the score.

307
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:55,070
I took off your clothes.
I cleaned you up.

308
00:39:55,322 --> 00:39:57,961
I tied you down.
I also saved your ass.

309
00:39:58,442 --> 00:40:02,640
You've been bitten by a vampire.
Remember the party at the motel?

310
00:40:03,202 --> 00:40:06,399
Big guy, pointy teeth.
Really shitty breath.

311
00:40:06,922 --> 00:40:08,275
Don't worry.

312
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:09,875
It'll come back to you.

313
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:14,472
A master vampire has a telepathic
link with his victims.

314
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:16,833
You're gonna help us find him.

315
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,238
While he's sleeping,
we unleash on him.

316
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,839
You're the bait, honey.

317
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:24,235
Sorry.

318
00:40:34,602 --> 00:40:36,081
I know all about you, Mr. Crow.

319
00:40:36,322 --> 00:40:38,836
I know your parents were
bitten by vampires.

320
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:42,040
You were raised by the Church
as it's master slayer.

321
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,875
The truth is, I didn't want
to be forced on you.

322
00:40:47,122 --> 00:40:50,080
I was supposed to take over when
Father Giovanni retired.

323
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,874
I always dreamed of this.

324
00:40:52,122 --> 00:40:55,034
Ever since I first heard
about you, the slayers.

325
00:40:55,682 --> 00:40:58,799
I want to be part of the team,
just do whatever I could.

326
00:40:59,002 --> 00:41:00,993
For example, if you
wanted to receive...

327
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:02,880
...the sacrament of confession-?

328
00:41:03,122 --> 00:41:04,191
Fucking priest!

329
00:41:16,522 --> 00:41:17,637
Who set us up?

330
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:19,395
Was it you? Who set us up?

331
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:20,597
Who was it?

332
00:41:20,842 --> 00:41:22,958
Was it you? Who set us up?

333
00:41:23,322 --> 00:41:25,438
I don't know what you mean!

334
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:28,242
You don't think I'll
kill you, a priest.

335
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:30,552
You're seriously misjudging me!

336
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:32,918
You want to kill me,
you go ahead!

337
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:35,630
I don't know what you're
talking about!

338
00:41:36,522 --> 00:41:37,841
I don't.

339
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:44,234
We'll see about that.

340
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:51,478
Where are we going?

341
00:41:54,082 --> 00:41:56,038
You have to tell me, Mr. Crow.

342
00:41:58,002 --> 00:41:59,276
You ever seen a vampire?

343
00:42:00,442 --> 00:42:02,672
First of all,
they're not romantic.

344
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:05,834
They're not a bunch of fags
in rented formalwear...

345
00:42:06,082 --> 00:42:08,642
...seducing everybody with
Euro-trash accents.

346
00:42:08,882 --> 00:42:11,032
Forget what you've seen
in the movies.

347
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:13,676
They don't turn into bats.
Crosses don't work.

348
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:18,074
Garlic? Stand there with garlic,
one of them will bend you over...

349
00:42:18,322 --> 00:42:21,553
...and walk up your strata chocolata
while sucking your blood!

350
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:24,993
All right? And they don't sleep
in taffeta-lined coffins.

351
00:42:25,202 --> 00:42:28,956
You wanna kill one? Drive a
wooden stake through his heart.

352
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,436
Sunlight turns them into
crispy critters.

353
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:34,430
Got it?

354
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:36,036
See this map?

355
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:41,837
This map shows all the encounters
in the U.S. as far back as the 1800s.

356
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,839
-I've never seen it.
-No one has.

357
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:46,681
Look at the Southwest.
See the spiral pattern?

358
00:42:46,922 --> 00:42:51,518
Time-sequence the encounters, you get
a logarithmic pattern, ever-widening.

359
00:42:52,122 --> 00:42:55,717
It's a search pattern, Padre.
They're looking for something.

360
00:42:56,402 --> 00:42:57,596
Do you know what it is?

361
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:00,640
I heard stories
when I was young.

362
00:43:01,282 --> 00:43:03,238
Something about a black cross.

363
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:05,991
About vampires walking
in the sunlight.

364
00:43:07,282 --> 00:43:08,317
Padre.

365
00:43:09,362 --> 00:43:11,034
Can I ask you something?

366
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:13,473
When I was kicking your ass...

367
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:15,641
...did that give you wood?

368
00:43:17,602 --> 00:43:20,435
You get a little mahogany
from that ebony?

369
00:43:22,282 --> 00:43:24,921
I'm just fucking with you.
Forget about it.

370
00:43:27,882 --> 00:43:30,237
And what God has given her...

371
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:34,276
... is that she sees
her guardian angel.

372
00:44:09,842 --> 00:44:11,639
Oh, Jesus!

373
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:25,871
What time is it?

374
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:30,991
9:10.

375
00:44:40,922 --> 00:44:42,275
You want one?

376
00:44:43,562 --> 00:44:45,234
You gotta eat something.

377
00:44:45,722 --> 00:44:47,360
I can't.

378
00:44:49,922 --> 00:44:51,719
I wouldn't mind a cigarette.

379
00:44:58,682 --> 00:44:59,797
We have to work on this.

380
00:45:00,002 --> 00:45:02,311
The less you eat,
the faster the virus moves.

381
00:45:02,522 --> 00:45:03,557
Virus?

382
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:07,758
That's what I call it.
Nobody knows what it really is.

383
00:45:07,962 --> 00:45:10,635
Poison, Kool-Aid,
it all does the same thing.

384
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:12,639
Turns you into a vampire.

385
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:24,072
What happened to the other girls?

386
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,550
They didn't make it.

387
00:45:27,242 --> 00:45:28,561
I'm sorry.

388
00:45:30,122 --> 00:45:32,033
So you remember now?

389
00:45:33,322 --> 00:45:34,835
Yeah, some.

390
00:45:36,082 --> 00:45:38,880
-Why doesn't anyone know?
-Nobody wants to know.

391
00:45:39,122 --> 00:45:41,636
That's how vampires survive.
They're smart.

392
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:46,040
They keep their numbers low,
and the world never catches on.

393
00:45:47,282 --> 00:45:48,476
Will I be one?

394
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,238
I don't know for sure.

395
00:45:53,362 --> 00:45:54,238
Probably.

396
00:45:55,722 --> 00:45:59,237
Unless we find him before you turn.

397
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:01,758
Then, maybe there's a chance.

398
00:46:04,922 --> 00:46:06,150
Here's what we do know.

399
00:46:06,522 --> 00:46:11,038
You're connected to the master vampire.
He's a part of you.

400
00:46:11,642 --> 00:46:13,155
And this link will grow.

401
00:46:14,202 --> 00:46:16,477
You'll never get him out of you.

402
00:46:17,082 --> 00:46:19,232
Not while he still exists.

403
00:46:19,802 --> 00:46:21,633
Then I don't want to live.

404
00:46:23,642 --> 00:46:24,677
You may not.

405
00:46:43,402 --> 00:46:44,755
Can I get dressed now?

406
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:47,158
Sure.

407
00:46:48,642 --> 00:46:51,031
Could you get me a towel
or something?

408
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:53,958
It's not like I haven't
seen you naked.

409
00:46:54,202 --> 00:46:55,396
Fuck it!

410
00:46:55,602 --> 00:46:57,433
Easy, easy.
I'll get you a towel.

411
00:46:57,682 --> 00:47:00,833
One towel coming right up.
I won't peek.

412
00:47:11,802 --> 00:47:14,839
Nice try. Leave the door open.

413
00:47:15,162 --> 00:47:16,675
No way.

414
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,640
A little bit.

415
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,716
-Don't do it!
-Goddamn it, let me go!

416
00:48:48,522 --> 00:48:49,716
Let me go!

417
00:48:51,882 --> 00:48:52,678
Shit!

418
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:56,074
Stop it!

419
00:48:58,482 --> 00:48:59,551
Look what you did!

420
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:06,878
You fucking bit me!

421
00:49:07,802 --> 00:49:09,121
Are you fucking nuts?

422
00:49:11,002 --> 00:49:12,833
Where are you going?

423
00:49:13,202 --> 00:49:15,477
You bite me, huh?
Get up!

424
00:49:15,682 --> 00:49:17,877
Fucking bite me!

425
00:49:20,522 --> 00:49:22,274
Fucking bitch!

426
00:49:25,122 --> 00:49:26,111
Fuck!

427
00:49:30,602 --> 00:49:32,081
Goddamn it!

428
00:49:49,922 --> 00:49:52,038
Fucking stupid whore.

429
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:05,040
Where are you?

430
00:50:07,602 --> 00:50:08,830
I'm fine.

431
00:50:09,442 --> 00:50:10,636
Yeah, I'm fine.

432
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:11,797
Room 312.

433
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:13,435
I'm coming up.

434
00:50:13,642 --> 00:50:15,041
Stay put.

435
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:24,641
I'm Father Adam Guiteau.
You're Tony Montoya?

436
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:26,361
You look different.

437
00:50:26,602 --> 00:50:29,639
I'm an archivist.
I've studied the team extensively.

438
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:40,957
What's this bruise on her jaw?

439
00:50:42,722 --> 00:50:43,916
I had to hit her.

440
00:50:45,002 --> 00:50:48,631
She tried to kill herself. I had to
pull her off the fire escape.

441
00:50:50,002 --> 00:50:51,833
Then I fell through the window.

442
00:50:55,242 --> 00:50:56,595
That's all?

443
00:51:04,602 --> 00:51:05,637
Why'd you slug her?

444
00:51:06,122 --> 00:51:08,352
I cut my arm on the broken glass.

445
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:10,433
I was pissed. I don't know.

446
00:51:10,642 --> 00:51:12,837
I fucking slugged her.
Who cares?

447
00:51:17,522 --> 00:51:18,716
That's our new Padre.

448
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:22,232
We've been ordered to Monterey.
Rebuild the team.

449
00:51:22,482 --> 00:51:24,552
-We're going back to Monterey?
-No.

450
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:27,032
Callahan's whole team is gone.

451
00:51:27,602 --> 00:51:28,432
Slaughtered.

452
00:51:29,322 --> 00:51:30,755
So it's just us now.

453
00:51:31,002 --> 00:51:31,991
That's right.

454
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:33,871
Who is she?

455
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:36,041
Some hooker.

456
00:51:36,442 --> 00:51:39,798
Bitten by Valek.
These vampires are psychically linked.

457
00:51:40,082 --> 00:51:42,232
As soon she hooks into Valek...

458
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:44,475
...we go look for him.

459
00:51:44,682 --> 00:51:46,274
We have orders to follow.

460
00:51:46,522 --> 00:51:47,557
Fuck you, Padre.

461
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:48,791
Language!

462
00:51:49,122 --> 00:51:52,512
If you don't follow orders,
I'll have to call Cardinal Alba.

463
00:51:57,202 --> 00:51:58,521
Excuse me.

464
00:51:59,002 --> 00:52:00,321
Language.

465
00:52:03,842 --> 00:52:05,912
We'll chat about language.
Shall we?

466
00:52:06,522 --> 00:52:08,035
See if this syntax works.

467
00:52:08,282 --> 00:52:11,035
You don't make a call,
don't blow your nose...

468
00:52:11,242 --> 00:52:14,359
...don't wipe your ass,
unless I tell you. Okay?

469
00:52:36,202 --> 00:52:37,874
Show me.

470
00:52:50,122 --> 00:52:51,111
Katrina?

471
00:52:51,562 --> 00:52:52,551
Can you hear me?

472
00:52:55,202 --> 00:52:55,998
What is it?

473
00:52:56,682 --> 00:53:00,675
There's someone else that you're
connected to in your mind, you know?

474
00:53:01,922 --> 00:53:03,275
What're you seeing?

475
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:07,351
I can't.

476
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:10,594
Yes, you can, honey.
You're with us and safe.
