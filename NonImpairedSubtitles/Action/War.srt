1
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:10,684
John! You alright?

2
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:11,878
Yeah.

3
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:14,718
Come on.

4
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:23,730
Did you get him?
-l got him.

5
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,927
You sure?
-Took one in the face.

6
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:28,499
He's dead. Relax.

7
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:34,130
What're you talking about, John?
You sound like you know this guy.

8
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:38,912
Nah. Just talk to you cause
l'm a real independent contractor...

9
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:40,380
to deal with the trance.

10
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,280
Suppose to be the best.

11
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:45,018
Same gunner that ClA
used to encounter that time.

12
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:48,078
Yeah... same guy that turn on this
handlers and killed 3 agents.

13
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,024
l heard it was 5.

14
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:53,288
lt's bullshit story, John.
You know that, alright?

15
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:55,395
Those are phantom. He's a myth.

16
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:56,963
Some of the agents can't get a change.

17
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:59,932
That's if he shows,
this bullet's his signature.

18
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:06,529
Do you really think Rogue
was working for Yakuza?

19
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:10,402
That's the trouble in this business.

20
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:12,878
You never know who's working for who.

21
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,151
This is the San Francisco police.

22
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,585
Remain where you are
with your hands in the air.

23
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:41,263
Yep. He's right here.
He's right here, John.

24
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:43,635
See you soon. Okay, bye-bye.

25
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:50,817
You tell him that he cannot smoke
in front of the kids!

26
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:54,054
lf he's going to smoke
he can do it in the yard.

27
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:55,885
Okay.

28
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:57,983
Go play.

29
00:02:58,225 --> 00:03:00,693
l thought he was quitting anyway.
-l thought he was too.

30
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:02,690
Yo, Tom!
-Gotcha!

31
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:08,702
You better be on the road.
Jam starts at 8:30.

32
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:11,000
l'm working on what the hell it is.

33
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:14,007
See if you got any traffic,
we'll make it behind after.

34
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:15,497
John.

35
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,011
Smoke fixation.

36
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,707
Hey, come on. Get your coat.

37
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:25,385
So, how's the case going?

38
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:27,153
Don't forget about the case.

39
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:28,688
John, you're on sick leave.

40
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:32,592
No. lnvestigations are on the way.
So far it's zip.

41
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,794
Somebody talked to him. Somebody inside.

42
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:36,530
Close to us.

43
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,532
And they know what happened to Rogue?

44
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:39,666
No, they never found the body.

45
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,635
They drag that pave for 3 days
and nothing.

46
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:43,500
And he's fisher by now.

47
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:47,207
Okay. Well, you scanned there, right?

48
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:50,343
Yeah. l've done this. Just tell me
how to forgot these things, okay?

49
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:52,868
Alright, so l didn't forget these things.

50
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:55,749
Christ, when are you gonna let that go?

51
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,751
Diane has made a check. She also
asked me to...

52
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:02,154
Hey... l heard, no smoking
in front of the kids.

53
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:08,885
Honey, we gotta stop off
and get some steaks.

54
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:40,884
Diane, hurry up.

55
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:45,259
No! Please!

56
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:47,290
No!

57
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,434
Diane, what's up?

58
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:51,660
Diane?

59
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,406
No!!

60
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:16,730
John. John. Honey.

61
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,721
Honey. Honey.

62
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,630
Oh my God.

63
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:34,475
Stay here with Daniel.

64
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:42,856
Where do you think you keep going?

65
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:44,157
l'm gonna have...

66
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:47,727
We have 3 fatal.
-What?

67
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:51,128
One male, one female and one child.

68
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,100
Sir. The ClA needs to finish.

69
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,898
We gotta let them do their thing.

70
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:08,469
Sir?

71
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:11,368
You gotta clear out of here now.

72
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,793
SAN FRANClSCO
THREE YEARS LATER

73
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,869
YAKUZA DlSTRlCT

74
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:27,775
My turn next...

75
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,709
Get him!

76
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:29,168
Make a hole.

77
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:31,838
Get these people out of here.

78
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:33,579
Just who the hell are you?

79
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,104
Asian Organized Crime Unit.
We'll be taking over from here.

80
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:39,418
Who's the authority?
-Mayor? President? Take your pick.

81
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:43,445
You don't look very Asian to me.

82
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:47,260
l know how to make sure you two
don't have this case wrap up by now.

83
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,921
Checked this? You Einstein?

84
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:50,863
Yes. l'm gonna cut the faces,
not the armor.

85
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:52,465
Agent Crawford?

86
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:54,228
l found this in the backroom.

87
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,871
We found him hiding underneath
one of the dead bodies.

88
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:00,373
He's in pretty bad shape.

89
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:01,841
Yeah. What's he been saying?

90
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:03,543
You can't right?

91
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:05,511
Who could understand all that shit?

92
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,146
These people come in to this country.

93
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:09,782
Think they'd at least learn
to speak American.

94
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:12,185
l think a couple of cops,
work in this district...

95
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:14,710
that close to Yakuza must learn
to speak a little Japanese.

96
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:18,289
lf they weren't
complete fucking idiots...

97
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,419
Give me a minute, would you?

98
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,432
Hi...

99
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:27,694
l'm a cop.

100
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,093
What happened here?

101
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,961
Know what l do when l'm not a cop?

102
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:35,504
l play doctor.

103
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,911
Hey! You can't do that!

104
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:42,608
lf l don't get this shrapnel out...

105
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:46,418
lt will get infected.

106
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,320
l got it.

107
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:53,525
No, it's a bone.

108
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:54,925
Sorry.

109
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,297
You want me to go back to my day job...

110
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,094
Give me something to do!

111
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,403
l want to die...

112
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,871
...before he comes back.

113
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:18,282
Well, l see it's gonna be a real picnic
working with you.

114
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:21,115
You ain't no working with me.

115
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:24,424
lt's the FBl case now.

116
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:27,188
You wanna help?
Take my shoes to the cleaners.

117
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,231
So what do you say?

118
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,667
A bunch of Japanese mumbo-jumbo.

119
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,100
There's no spirits.

120
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:43,637
Those stories.

121
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:34,160
Jen?

122
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,822
You haven't wake up?
lt's almost 9.

123
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:40,399
l was working late last night, so...

124
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,301
Well, l just call to remind you that...

125
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:44,929
it's Daniel's first basketball game
this Friday.

126
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:47,640
You forgot, didn't you?

127
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,710
No. Just a bit tired.
-See you.

128
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,803
Got a little thing on my mind right now.

129
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:54,447
Yeah. So what's it this time?

130
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:55,715
l found him, Jen.

131
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,216
Found who?

132
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,118
The guy who killed Tom.

133
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:02,383
He's back. l can feel it.

134
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,424
This time l'm taking him down.

135
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,392
John, it's been 3 years.

136
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:11,130
Look. You obsession with this man
has cost you our marriage.

137
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,030
Don't lose your son.

138
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:17,027
Tell Daniel l'll be there.
-No! You tell him.

139
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,202
lf you say you're gonna be there,
then be there.

140
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:48,561
Those of you who didn't get to meet
last night, this is Agent Goi.

141
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:50,498
Just graduated in Chronicle.

142
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:53,673
What's his aspects?

143
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,072
Oarsman.

144
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,574
What's so funny?

145
00:14:57,944 --> 00:14:59,741
How the way you expect here?

146
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:01,809
What are you?
-D.T

147
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:04,217
Defensive Tactics.

148
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:06,583
That's right.
l dig it up close in person.

149
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,222
Yeah. Well, my gun's bigger than yours.

150
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:10,756
Pick a desk.

151
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:13,122
Still get to sit your arse up.

152
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,694
Back there.

153
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:18,723
These are all the photos
anybody has of Rogue.

154
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:22,127
The guy work up his face every 6 months.

155
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:24,604
Come on, John.

156
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:26,902
Anybody can use titanium shields
and DU bullets.

157
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,274
Bullets found...

158
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:31,539
Bullets that we found last night
matches the ones we found 3 years ago.

159
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,976
Rogue's back.

160
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,684
Okay, if he works for the Yakuza...

161
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:40,853
Why would he kill Yakuza?

162
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:43,549
Maybe he switch sides.
This won't be the first time.

163
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:45,781
Who're we talking about?

164
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,761
Shiro Yamaga.

165
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,752
He's all Yakuza activity from Japan.

166
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,965
Probably the most powerful man
in San Fancisco...

167
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,092
and he hasn't set foot on American soil.

168
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:59,266
Except for it wasn't this test force
was put together.

169
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:02,373
The Chang is on the left.
Like Chio Chang lives here.

170
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,543
Nice big mansion in Marin.

171
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,738
lt's the Jade rock-a-fella or something.

172
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:10,883
He's a 49. Trial at Boston.

173
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:12,084
lnto everything.

174
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:14,279
Bribery, extortion, murder, you name it.

175
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:17,690
30 years ago,
Shiro put in Chang's family.

176
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,725
Just let the balls
to flood in to Hong Kong.

177
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,192
Wiped out the whole fucking clan.

178
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:24,697
He spent the next 30 years selling
every ornament of Qing dynasty...

179
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:26,365
to collectors and museums.

180
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:28,629
Well, that slave now
is a couple of oasis.

181
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:31,994
Stash woods. Two of them.
About this big.

182
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:35,264
Word on the street is that Shiro
was looking for a buyer as we speak.

183
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:36,909
Chain lost of honor.

184
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:39,278
lt means more or less financial lost.

185
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,269
l don't care about the oasis.

186
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,215
l don't care about bloodlines
or ancient family feuds.

187
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:46,150
But the first time in 3 years,
we got a real shiny clue.

188
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,581
All we have to do, ladies and gentlemen.

189
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:51,188
ls pull the fucking thread out.

190
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,880
CHANG MANSlON
MARlN COUNTY, CA

191
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:09,993
She's a very rare breed.

192
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:12,996
And delusion.

193
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,406
That's my wife, Maria.

194
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:20,613
ln my father's days, such reunion
when l have been possible.

195
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:22,774
But time's changed.

196
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:26,076
Those of us who change with it...
survive.

197
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,848
Come.

198
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:32,550
l am really impressed, Mr. Sho.

199
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:36,089
l heard that you've spilt
the blood of my enemies.

200
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,999
Let's drink.

201
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,626
To our new partnership.

202
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:49,236
l have to admit,

203
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:54,669
l was somewhat skeptical when you first
came to me with your proposal.

204
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,817
By living share a service,
that was a wise move on your part.

205
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:06,351
But it makes me wonder.

206
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,526
How could one truly trust a man
who had betrayed his master?

207
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:14,132
l have no master.

208
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,196
So l have betrayed no one.

209
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:19,966
So, tell me.

210
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:23,540
My Horses, they arrive tonight?

211
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,975
lt's been 30 years.

212
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:33,146
All this time, my family has lived
in shame and dishonor.

213
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,715
All because of Shiro's treachery.

214
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,917
Tonight, l will take back what was stolen
from my family.

215
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:42,627
And everything will change from here on.

216
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:46,997
Shiro's men will protect his treasure
with their lives.

217
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,967
Are you certain... you can deliver them?

218
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,339
l said that l would.

219
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,940
These two are the Ti brothers.

220
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,303
They will give you everything you need.

221
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,808
l'll be in touch.

222
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:17,159
Watch him closely.

223
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,061
YAKUZA COMPOUND
TOHOKU, JAPAN

224
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:52,553
l beg your forgiveness.

225
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,704
The fault is not yours, but mine.

226
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:03,241
l left myself unguarded.

227
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:21,116
l trust you have news from San Francisco.

228
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,559
Yes, everything is proceeding
as requested.

229
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:25,898
And the Horses?

230
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:27,399
We've shipped them out.

231
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:30,061
They will arrive
in San Francisco tonight.

232
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,404
You must return to San Francisco...

233
00:21:32,404 --> 00:21:33,666
...in advance of my arrival.

234
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:35,841
But Father...

235
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:39,242
l don't trust our people there.

236
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:42,747
They have become too lazy to be useful.

237
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:45,979
l was hoping to stay here...

238
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:48,644
...and further my role in the clan.

239
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:52,120
Nothing in the history of our clan...

240
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,060
...has ever been more important.

241
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,051
l will not fail you.

242
00:21:57,262 --> 00:22:00,789
Go now. Oversee the sale of the Horses.

243
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:13,009
CHlNATOWN, SAN FRANClSCO

244
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:33,726
Hey, what's up, dude?

245
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,863
l'd like to see Benny.

246
00:22:36,068 --> 00:22:37,558
No Benny's here.

247
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:55,910
Yeah. Again!

248
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:01,222
Hey baby.

249
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,732
We need to talk.

250
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:08,666
l don't talk to defense.

251
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:14,831
Someone glad. Now.

252
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:23,280
My guys lose in anyways.

253
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:47,973
Business is good l see.

254
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:49,941
Has the most for homerun security, right?

255
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:52,177
lt's the part of the family.

256
00:23:52,177 --> 00:23:53,545
l bet that is fine.

257
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:56,241
lt's a gem. That's another story.

258
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,344
You have every right there.
How did you fuck that up?

259
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:02,287
lt wasn't hard.

260
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,551
Anyway. Thanks for the help.

261
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:07,349
You make me look good.
-l hope it helps.

262
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:13,065
People out there didn't expect the FBl
pay me so good to something like this.

263
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:14,333
Makes me look the gym.

264
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,034
Was that the end to poor Hamburg?

265
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:16,935
Come on, John.

266
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:19,495
They know signs, catch and crooks.
You know that.

267
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,997
They just said you have something for me.
-Yeah.

268
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:29,140
Our friend over in Russels, the guy
who make those titanium bullets.

269
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:33,309
Found him two days ago.

270
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,921
Now you'll have to check and see
if everyone on those association...

271
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,855
was wrong and having some bad luck.

272
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:43,061
Just last week.

273
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:44,797
Plastic surgeon Dr. Paramount.

274
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:48,028
He has deadly buried himself for the
kitchen knife making a turkey sandiwch.

275
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:53,534
Week before that, another one of our
scrapper friend Donald Florida was killed

276
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:57,104
Some gangs. Can't see to read the signs.

277
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,511
Anyway.

278
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:02,446
These guys, they're both specialize
in facial reconstruction.

279
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:06,348
Both of them.

280
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:10,022
Mass ton of blue sense.

281
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:12,524
Yeah. Well, there's another surgeon
who's accounted for.

282
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:14,788
l think he might be still alive.
Maybe trying to get out.

283
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:19,355
You let me know this set of services...
and its money.

284
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:31,841
Button up, this isn't a disco.

285
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:37,509
ls that our contact?

286
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:40,379
Yes... my contact.

287
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:47,583
Get rid of him.

288
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:49,328
He's my brother. He's with me.

289
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:51,421
What the fuck this guy thinks he is?

290
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:58,003
Go back to the car.

291
00:25:58,003 --> 00:26:00,938
Wu, please. He's an outsider.
-Go!

292
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,906
Don't make me say it again.

293
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:16,221
After this is done...

294
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:17,518
...you and l are going to talk.

295
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:28,366
The Horses are intact.
Shiro will be pleased.

296
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:32,498
We'll contact you when we get there.

297
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:47,276
Are the Horses safe with this crew?

298
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:49,177
Of course, as far as they know...

299
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:50,979
...they're just delivering cars.

300
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:26,254
Stay calm and cooperate.

301
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:28,016
lt's just a routine check.

302
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,867
l need you out of the car.
Both of you.

303
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:37,502
Put your hands where l can see them.

304
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:38,537
Oh, no, sir.

305
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:41,438
You're shooting on our enterprises.
You're making a huge mistake.

306
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,767
We made the arrangements.
-Out of the car!

307
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:54,208
Turn around.

308
00:27:56,154 --> 00:28:00,284
You're playing fire on us.
Who's your captain?

309
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:02,060
Shut up.
-Let go off us.

310
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,493
Shut up.

311
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:07,229
Fucking rent-a-cops...
-l said shut up.

312
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,968
Did you check the entrance?

313
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,708
What the fuck is going on?

314
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,903
l thought we made arrangement.

315
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:21,612
Just a little change of the plan.

316
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:24,441
l need my money. Now.

317
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:37,295
So, we're all good to go?

318
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:40,055
Oh yeah. You're good to go.

319
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:43,467
Just wait here for a sec.
Let me and the boys clear out.

320
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:46,471
Let's go.

321
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,839
Do it.

322
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,399
Mr. Chang send his regard.

323
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:13,292
CHANG'S WAREHOUSE 16

324
00:29:57,509 --> 00:29:59,443
Compliments from Mr. Chang.

325
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,313
There's some serious shit here, brother

326
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,018
Yakuzas, all of them

327
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:43,555
All lined up

00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:44,988
Shots at the back

329
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:46,758
The execution style
-Excuse me

330
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:50,125

333
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:07,845
This guy was escorting something big

334
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,309
lf it was it must've been important

335
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:22,152
There was only 1 thing that'll stop
this guy from falling down

336
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:25,625
Cops

337
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:27,899
Listen, i don't want cops

338
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:31,563
Hold on just a damn minute,
are you trying to say cops did this?

339
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:36,737
lf they didn't they were involved
-No fucking way

340
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:40,002
For all we know it could've been
1 of you guys

And i wanna get this boy
free passes from the smuggling shit

That's the federal man

348
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,651

349
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:01,189
Tell me if you see the bullet

350
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:04,557
Can you see it?
-l see it

351
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:08,033
He said he'd kill me

352
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:10,263
He said he got my family

353
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:12,671
Who? who said that?

354
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,205
l don't know who

355
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:16,741

He knows when my kids go to school

359
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:32,379
You stupid bastard

360
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:36,322
You think he isn't gonna kill us
if you do as he said, you fucked up

361
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:51,874
He got statements, call the Washington

362
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,410
Down...everyone down!

363
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:23,842

Kira-san, welcome

377
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:21,926
Your presence honors me

378
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:26,124
And your stupidity insults my father

379
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:28,056
We were just discussing...

380
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:33,003
l've brought word from Sako directly

381
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:35,695
You're to do nothing until he
instructs you to

382
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:38,109
The Horses have been stolen!

383
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:39,542
lf we don't strike back...

384
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:45,541
Are you disobeying my order?

385
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:52,981

407
00:38:35,893 --> 00:38:37,258

Mr Chang

413
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,039
Still pretending to be legit?

414
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,939
Watch your mouth

415
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:26,306
Don't forget who you're talking to here

416

00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:40,385
Open it

419
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:56,436
Put your hands at the back of your head!

420
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,400
Now! motherfucker

No wonder he's clean

423
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,133
Victor Shiro

424
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:27,270
So, that's what you call yourself

Check the warehouse,
make sure nothing's hidden

427
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:41,851
She knew it isnt it?

428
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:45,014
Look me in the eyes

429
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:47,224
Something real familiar about it

430
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:54,393
lt's the 1 thing surgeons can't change,
can they?

431
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:56,959
Your eyes

432
00:40:58,169 --> 00:41:00,729
What the hell do you know?

433
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,370
You don't even know he was a same man

434
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:09,745
But you're, aren't you?

l know you're

436
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:20,686
So, is the Yakuza looking for
the traits?

437
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:27,421
Only if you understand me

438
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,701
The one you wanna follow wasn't it?

439
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:37,798
What? don't remember?

440
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:40,204
Maybe you'd remember my partner

441
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:43,280
You do, don't you?

442
00:41:45,316 --> 00:41:47,284
Remember his name?

443
00:41:48,886 --> 00:41:50,649

Remember the cabin in the woods?

447
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,497
Cabin that you burnt to the ground?

448
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:07,128
And police still inside

449
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,575
Remember that?

450
00:42:10,575 --> 00:42:12,372
Do you remember that?

451
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:16,275
Say it

452
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:19,442
Say it, say you remember

453
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:22,410
Say you fucking remember!

454
00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:29,325
You'll only find the only pain
living in the past

455
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:31,989
Crawford, there's nothing here.
He checks out

456
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:34,898
Send to me

457
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:38,202
What if it's?

458
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:41,404
But rite now we got nothing

459
00:42:44,108 --> 00:42:46,042
Come on, man, there'll be another day

00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:48,736
Alrite?

461

Another day

464

Another day you and
l're gonna finish this

465
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:11,995

466
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:15,395
Everyone, go back

467
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:31,755
How in the world did you know the
FBl were coming?

468
00:43:32,056 --> 00:43:35,048
Experience

469
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:38,896
You've impressed me once again,
my friend

470
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:42,300
As you see

471
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,495
The FBl had declared war on us

472
00:43:45,236 --> 00:43:46,604
Now fuck them

He's trouble

He's chasing ghost

483
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,027

Why don't you go down stairs
and play for mummy?

494
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,935
But you weren't playing

497
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:43,914
But i'm warning you to stay
away from Anna

498
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:46,781
My husband's work and our family
are 2 seperate things

499
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:51,252
Do we understand each other?
-Yes, Mrs Chang

500
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:54,347
Good

501
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:11,703
Don't think...
i don't know what you're doing

502
00:47:12,143 --> 00:47:13,744
You used to check my thing

503
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:15,803
You as me rite now

504
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:18,849
But i'm still the 1...

505
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:21,374
Who looks after things around here

506
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:25,679
And i remember in the world...
things change

507
00:47:38,169 --> 00:47:39,336
Triad Districy

508
00:47:39,336 --> 00:47:40,064
l say it again

509
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:47,742
What the fuck?

510
00:47:57,855 --> 00:47:59,652
He fucking intrudes us, let's go!

511
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:51,900
..teach that fucking Jap a lesson

512
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:35,252
You fucking bastard

513
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:37,015
l knew i should never have trusted you

514
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,189
This guy showed a signal

515
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:16,827
So what now?

516
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:18,454
Take him for a walk

517
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:26,159
So as he, that's all i asked

518
00:50:27,204 --> 00:50:29,729
We're gonna check Chang's
place in a minute

519
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:32,176
Daniel, you can get us noticed

520
00:50:32,176 --> 00:50:34,167
Kira, you go to house 16

521
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:37,341
Wick and Goi, keep on the sides
of the house

522
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:39,616
We can lure that guy out

523
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:41,385
l think i know how to look thru a nite club

524
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:42,486
Keep your eyes up, everybody

525
00:50:42,486 --> 00:50:44,784
We should go down somewhere and
be ready to move in in the call

526
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:50,023
The four are expecting us to retaliate

527
00:50:50,594 --> 00:50:53,859
lf we strike now we risk everything
-What if it was your family?

528
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:56,328
What the fuck's wrong with you?

529
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,868
You forgot?

530
00:50:57,868 --> 00:50:59,893
Once it was my family?

531
00:51:00,537 --> 00:51:02,528
He was like a son to me

532
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:05,738
Revenge's a must

533
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:08,879
But you must be patient

534
00:51:08,879 --> 00:51:11,541
l'd allow nothing to put our family
at risk

535
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:15,985
l want you to do nothing

536
00:51:16,253 --> 00:51:17,880
ls that clear?

537
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:37,768
Sure all knows it's the day coming
to an end

538
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:41,470
And it's shown

539
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,515
More blood will be spilt before
this's over

540
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:49,775
Mr Shiro,

541
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,889
l want your word

542
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:54,289
My wife and daughter'll be safe

543
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:58,852
No harm'll come to them

544
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:11,939
Chang'd never give up his own

545
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:17,646
But the owner of his family

546
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:27,789
Keep that

547
00:52:40,904 --> 00:52:42,804
''Sayu Tea House''

548
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:02,516
Oh man

549
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:06,093
l didn't know your mum was working
tonite

550
00:53:06,463 --> 00:53:08,363
Keep going, mark boy

551
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:17,198
Yo, heads up

552
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:18,868
Looks like Takada's over for a tea

553
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:03,985
Shit, call Crawford back,
i'm stalling down now

554
00:54:10,928 --> 00:54:12,429
Crawford

555
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:13,530
We get trouble

556
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:14,998
He just showed up just like you said

557
00:54:14,998 --> 00:54:16,397

-Copy that

558
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:27,932
This's for my brother

559
00:55:28,605 --> 00:55:30,163
He's dead
-Come on!

560
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:46,823

Drop your weapons!

566
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:12,277
Hands on the counter where
i can see them

567
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:21,749
Situation secure,
units stand on cease fire

568
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:28,088
Damn it, Goi, cease fucking fire!

Fuck you!

573
00:58:15,872 --> 00:58:20,332
Your pig's dead

574
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:26,314
Mr Japan

575
01:00:52,796 --> 01:00:54,464
Yes?

576
01:00:54,464 --> 01:00:57,695
Wu and his boys shot up in Takada's
Tea House last nite

577
01:00:58,201 --> 01:00:59,936

Wu Ti?

579
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:03,965
Are you sure?

580
01:01:04,074 --> 01:01:06,209
l tried to stop them

581
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:08,336
Damn it, i told him not to do anything

582
01:01:08,712 --> 01:01:12,045
He leaves me no choice

583
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:24,589
You've done well

584
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:27,289
My father's very pleased

585
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:33,367
He'll never ask 1 more thing from you

586
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:36,969
Chang, his operation'll be destroyed

587
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:40,067
What more do you want?

588
01:01:46,616 --> 01:01:48,345
Why?

589
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:51,510
That's the order, there is no why
