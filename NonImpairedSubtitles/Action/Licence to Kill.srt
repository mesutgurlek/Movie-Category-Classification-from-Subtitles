00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..half the officials from here to Chile.

109
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's only one law
down there - Sanchez's law.

110
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Plomo o plata.
- Lead or silver.

111
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Ah.
- Ed.

112
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Double congratulations, old buddy.

113
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You take your time on the honeymoon.
Everything's OK.

114
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You must be Bond.
The guy who came along for the ride.

115
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ed Killifer.

116
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're takin' Sanchez
to Quantico this afternoon.

117
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Stay and have a drink with us.
- Gotta get back.

118
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I just came by to kiss the bride.

119
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Felix, time to cut the cake.
- Oh. Hand me the picture of Della, quick.

120
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
She must be ready to kill me.

121
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I tied 'em myself.
- What are these?

122
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Lures.
- These'll keep you busy for a few days.

123
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're not going fishing
on my honeymoon.

124
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,273  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How many others are being held there?
- Where are you taking him, Mr Killifer?

125
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mr Sanchez, will you look
this way for a picture, please?

126
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Come on! Get him inside!
- What is your real nationality?

127
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you really Colombian?
- Have you been fairly treated?

128
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
One more picture!

129
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you connected with
any laboratories in South America?

130
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No more questions, now!
- Do you expect to be vindicated?

131
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
OK, let's go.

132
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(calypso music)

133
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Would you excuse me just a minute?

134
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I have a surprise for you.
Yes, I do! It's right over here.

135
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What's that?

136
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
James. Love always. Della and Felix.

137
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We love you.

138
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thanks.

139
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on!

140
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What the hell's happened?

141
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How deep is it there?

142
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Call up an amphibian!

143
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, James.
I wanted you to have something.

144
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know the tradition? The next one
who catches this is the next one who...

145
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,995  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. No.

146
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thanks, Della. It's time I left.

147
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, James.

148
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Did I say something wrong?
- He was married once.

149
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
But it was a long time ago.

150
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Felix, you're no good to me
with a wrecked back.

151
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let her go. I'm the one you want.

152
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey! Ready to go? We got
the batteries recharged on the sub.

153
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It'll take you to the limit. Fast boat
to Cuba. You'll be there for breakfast.

154
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Relax. We'll wait for Dario.
- Look, are you crazy?

155
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You got everybody lookin' for you. What
about Killifer? Havin' a cop here is nuts.

156
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I wanna deep six him.

157
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I made a deal with this guy,
and I'm gonna keep my word.

158
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,948  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't like it. He can finger me.
I spent a fortune on this cover.

159
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Something you'd better
understand, amigo.

160
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Loyalty is more important
to me than money.

161
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now get the cop.

162
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Killifer.

163
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Here's two million. All in twenties.
It's very heavy, but difficult to trace.

164
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Smart.
- Now, be ready for tomorrow.

165
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll have someone pick you up.

166
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where's Lupe?
- On the boat.

167
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Keep her there until I send for her.

168
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Est bien.

169
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, no foolin' around with my girl.

170
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you kiddin'? After what you did
to that guy on the islands?

171
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You liked my little valentine, huh?

172
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where's my wife?
- Don't worry.

173
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We gave her a nice honeymoon.

174
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I want you to know
this is nothing personal.

175
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's purely... business.

176
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Killifer?!

177
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sorry, old buddy, but two mil
is a hell of a chunk of dough.

178
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Aagh!

179
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Killing me won't stop anything, Sanchez!

180
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There are worse things
than dying, hombre.

181
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Aagh! Aagh!

182
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Aagh! Aagh!

183
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
See you in hell!

184
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

185
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No!

186
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(Felix screams)

187
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(sirens)

188
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(helicopters)

189
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

190
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you. Your passport, please.

191
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's going on?
- Some big drug dealer just escaped.

192
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now, would that be smoking
or nonsmoking, Mr...

193
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your ticket!

194
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(knocks)

195
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Felix?

196
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Della!

197
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,789  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Della?
- Felix. You'll be all right. Hang on.

198
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(phone rings)

199
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- (man) Hey, Leiter. Where you been?
- It's Bond. Get an ambulance here, quick!

200
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,191  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hi, Sharky.

201
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You stick around. I might have
some more questions for you, OK?

202
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
How is he?

203
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
His left leg's gone below the knee.
They might be able to save his arm.

204
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You can bet it was a chain saw.
Colombians use them on informers.

205
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hell, they sell more here
than in the state of Oregon.

206
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I wish I could be more hopeful,
but we'll have to wait and see.

207
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Chain saw, my ass.
I know a shark bite when I see one.

208
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sanchez has vanished.
He's got all of Leiter's files.

209
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- God only knows what's in them.
- Well, find him.

210
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's out of our jurisdiction. There's plenty
of countries that would protect him.

211
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- We can't even get an extradition.
- There are other ways.

212
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Let it go, Commander.
- You're gonna do nothing?

213
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're just gonna forget all about it?
- No, I'm not gonna forget about it.

214
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Looks like Sanchez' law
operates north of the border, too.

215
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let's go shark-hunting.

216
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is the last place in the Keys.
We'll have to try Miami next.

217
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stay here.

218
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You stay out of sight. I'll handle this.

219
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(bell rings)

220
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're closed. Ain't nobody here.

221
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, I've come all the way
from London to see you.

222
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Universal Exports. We've been retained...

223
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..to arrange shipment
of a Carcharodon carcharias.

224
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- A what?
- Great white shark.

225
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,994  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's all right, Bill. Let him in.

226
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Unfortunately, we sold
all our sharks years ago.

227
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
As you can see, we do purely research
now. It's a project to feed the Third World.

228
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We feed maggot to our special breed
of genetically engineered fish.

229
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,508  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Use hormones to make them all male -
gain weight faster.

230
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
From your shark-hunting days?

231
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Uh, yeah. Actually, it's for sale.

232
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, I'm kinda busy.
Maybe some other time.

233
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you. I'll look forward
to seeing you again.

234
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Goodbye, Mr, er...
- Goodbye.

235
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(splashing)

236
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mr Krest said to be ready. He'll send the
sub back in three hours to pick you up.

237
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Can't wait.

238
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This dump gives me the creeps.

239
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
James.

240
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hold it... right there.

241
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you mind if I get
my hands out of here?

242
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah. Do it slowly.

243
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Bon apptit.

244
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(gunfire)

245
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Freeze!

246
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Over by the trap door, old buddy.

247
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Is this where you put
your old buddy Felix?

248
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Not me. Chalk that one up
to Sanchez and Krest.

249
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Whoa! Whoa!

250
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's two million dollars
in that suitcase.

251
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'll split it with you.

252
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You earned it.

253
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You keep it... old buddy.

254
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Aagh!

255
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(Sharky) God, what a terrible waste.

256
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Of money.

257
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, Sharky!

258
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Any news on the Wavekrest?
- She's a big marine-research vessel,...

259
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..owned by a Milton Krest.

260
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
They're collecting specimens
off the Cay Sel Bank.

261
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How long will it take us to get there?
- Maybe about six hours.

262
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've a few things to pick up.
Be ready in an hour.

263
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, Commander. You got a minute?

264
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Local cops got a tip
about a warehouse last night.

265
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Turned up 500 keys of Colombian pure,
a couple of stiffs,...

266
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..and a little bitty piece
of what used to be Killifer.

267
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Good. At least someone's on the case.

268
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You may be a pal of Leiter's,
but I can only cover up so much.

269
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The DEA is screaming
to know what happened.

270
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know, we, we got laws
in this country, too.

271
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Do you have a law against
what they did to Leiter?

272
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Look, you're in over your head.
This is where it ends, Commander.

273
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You were supposed to be
in lstanbul last night.

274
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'm afraid this unfortunate Leiter
business has... clouded your judgment.

275
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have a job to do. I expect you
on a plane this afternoon.

276
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I haven't finished here, sir.
- Leave it to the Americans.

277
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- It's their mess. Let them clear it up.
- Sir, they're not going to do anything.

278
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I owe it to Leiter. He's put his life
on the line for me many times.

279
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Oh, spare me this sentimental rubbish!
He knew the risks.

280
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And his wife?
- This private vendetta of yours...

281
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..could easily compromise
Her Majesty's Government.

282
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have an assignment. I expect you to
carry it out objectively and professionally.

283
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Then you have my resignation, sir.

284
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're not a country club, 007.

285
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Effective immediately...
your licence to kill is revoked,...

286
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..and I require you
to hand over your weapon.

287
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now.

288
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I need hardly remind you that you're
still bound by the Official Secrets Act.

289
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, I guess it's, er...

290
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..a farewell to arms.

291
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't! Too many people!

292
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
God help you, Commander.

293
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(gunfire on TV)

294
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(bleeping)

295
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Something in Sector C.

296
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You caused us all
a lot of trouble, young lady.

297
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're borracho. Go to bed.
- When Sanchez heard you ran away,...

298
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- ..he went nuts.
- It's none of your business.

299
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's my business when your stupid
little tricks get Sanchez arrested...

300
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..and I gotta put my organisation
at risk to get him out.

301
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The DEA just raided Key West.
You cost me a lot of dough.

302
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He'll give you the money.
- Uh-uh.

303
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He doesn't work that way.
You'd better watch yourself, girlie.

304
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I've known him a long time. I've seen
a lot of girls like you come... and go.

305
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're drunk. Get out.

306
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And stop peeking through my windows.
- Come on. What are you so stuck-up for?

307
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He fixed that phoney
beauty contest you won.

308
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Hey...
- Mr Krest.

309
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah. What?

310
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The Sentinel's picking up something large
on the monitor. You'd better take a look.

311
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I don't believe this.

312
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What the hell is it now?

313
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's just a manta ray. Get the probe
back in. We'll start loading now.

314
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yes, sir.

315
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(sonar bleeps)

316
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(laughing)

317
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He said "You're OK."

318
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(snoring)

319
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(groaning)

320
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Take care of him.

321
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Make a sound and you're dead.

322
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You...
- What are you doing in here?

323
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,152  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Krest gave me his cabin. He's next door.
- Where's Sanchez?

324
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's not on board.
I don't know where he is.

325
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're his girlfriend.
- He doesn't tell me anything.

326
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(knocking)

327
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(Krest) Open up. I need to talk to you.

328
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Answer it.

329
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Just a moment.

330
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What do you want?
- Somebody slipped aboard. Did you...

331
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- ..see anybody?
- No, I was sleeping. Go away.

332
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mr Krest. They're back.

333
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Bolt your door.

334
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Who whipped you? Sanchez?

335
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It was my fault.
I did something wrong, made him angry.

336
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(ship's horn)

337
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Nice work, Clive.
- Thanks, Mr Krest.

338
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Guess what? His name was Sharky.

339
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(Krest) Get rid of the boat.
We've got work to do.

340
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You'd better find yourself a new lover.
- Don't you men know any other way?

341
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's Sanchez' way. You seem to like it.

342
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know nothing. Please go.
If they find you here, we'll both be killed.

343
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stay here.

344
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We got everything useful out of her.

345
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- That's it. Take her out and sink her.
- OK, Clive. Cast off!

346
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Compliments of Sharky.

347
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Man overboard!

348
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get him! Don't let him get away!

349
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's wrong?
- Get back in your cabin and stay there.

350
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- The guy must have drowned, Mr Krest.
- Don't be so sure. Find him.

351
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Launch Sentinel.
- Yes, sir.

352
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Stand by to dive when I tell you.

353
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Numbers one and two, dive!

354
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I can see something reflecting over there.

355
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There's too much turbulence to be sure.

356
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Wavekrest, Wavekrest. Estamos listos.
- Muy bien.

357
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Loading completed, Mr Krest.
- Bring Sentinel back in.

358
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Mr Krest!

359
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Bring Sentinel up!

360
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,392  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There he is, there! Right there! Get him!

361
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There!

362
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Dive, dammit! Dive!

363
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Se ha cado.

364
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Aagh!

365
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Aagh!

366
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There! Pick him up!

367
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- All boats return to Wavekrest!
- Aye aye, sir!

368
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Here. Put her stern-in.

369
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hey, do you know
someone called Bouvier?

370
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Over there.

371
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now, this is an unexpected pleasure.

372
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where's Leiter?
- Intensive Care.

373
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Where you'll be
if you don't get out of here fast.

374
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sanchez has Leiter's files.
Your name's all over them.

375
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hell, I knew something was wrong.
Those two have been at the bar for hours.

376
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Probably waiting to see who showed up.
- Would you like anything to drink?

377
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Bud with a lime.
- Same.

378
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sure thing, hon.

379
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Shit! It's Dario.

380
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's bad news. He used to be with
the Contras before they kicked him out.

381
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Just the kind of guy Sanchez would send.

382
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You carrying?

383
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(tuts)

384
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If they start shooting,
just hit the deck and stay there.

385
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
La senorita Bouvier.

386
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Don't I know you from somewhere?

387
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- No.
- Oh, yes, I do.

388
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You used to fly charter planes
for some friends of mine.

389
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I got a job for you. Why don't we
go outside and we talk in private?

390
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Take your hands off her! She's with me.
- Nobody's asking you, gringo.

391
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's with me.
Keep your hands on the table.

392
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Here we go.

393
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Two beers. That'll be 3.50.

394
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Do your friends want something?
- Let me get it.

395
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- He's had enough. Run a tab.
- OK.

396
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- How did you get here?
- By boat. It's right behind this wall.

397
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thanks.

398
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Touch!

399
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Get it started.

400
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(motor starts)

401
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Come on!

402
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,312  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(Bouvier groans)

403
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Don't move.
- Relax. It's a bulletproof vest.

404
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- This Kevlar is great!
- You're bloody lucky to be alive!

405
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's not luck. It's experience.

406
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Any higher, it'd have been your head.
- Look, I just saved your life back there!

407
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If it wasn't for me,
your ass would've been nailed to the wall.

408
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You saved my life?
- Yes.

409
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's a tough business
you picked, Miss Bouvier.

410
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Leave it to the professionals.
- Look, pal, I was an army pilot.

411
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I have flown to the toughest hellholes!

412
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I will not have you lecture me
about professionalism!

413
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(bleeping)

414
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Out of gas. I haven't heard
that one in a long time.

415
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, they must have hit the fuel line.
Look, I'm gonna need your help.

416
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I want a complete rundown
on Sanchez' operation.

417
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I'll need a flight to lsthmus City.
Private. No one must know I've left.

418
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What do you wanna go there for?
- I'll pay you very well.

419
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You're going after Sanchez, aren't you?

420
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Will you help me?
- How many men have you got?

421
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Just you and me.

422
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Are you crazy? Sanchez has
an entire army protecting him.

423
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Just fly me in and leave. 50,000.
- It's not that easy.

424
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
False flight plans, payoffs at the airport.
I can't do it for less than a hundred.

425
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sixty.

426
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Ninety.
- Seventy.

427
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Eighty.
- Seventy-five.

428
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You pay the fuel?
- You get the plane.

429
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Deal.

430
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why don't you wait until you're asked?
- Well, why don't you ask me?

431
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(horn)

432
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
There are five typing errors on
the first page alone. What's got into you?

433
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Sorry, sir.

434
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
"US lmmigration has no reports
of 007 leaving the United States...

435
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..as of 1 500 hours today."

436
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Who authorised this?
- I did, sir. It's James. He's gone missing.

437
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:47,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You know him better than that.
He'll go after Sanchez.

438
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's got to be stopped.
I've already alerted our man in lsthmus.

439
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I want that out by this afternoon.
- Yes, sir.

440
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Q Branch, please.

441
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Hector Lopez, tu presidente,...

442
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:12,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..te pide que votes por los candidatos
del Partido Revolucionario lsthmo.

443
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Beneficios para el pueblo
con Hector Lopez.

444
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Beneficios para el pueblo. Hector Lopez.

445
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is the master bedroom.

446
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I hope everything is satisfactory, senor.
- It's adequate.

447
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'd like a case of champagne -
Bollinger RD.

448
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,037  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Certainly. If I could ask you
to sign the registration cards?

449
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No. My executive secretary,
Miss Kennedy, will take care of that.

450
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Miss Kennedy.

451
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Right here, please.

452
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Gracias.

453
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Fresh flowers every day.

454
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you very much.

455
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Your key. Enjoy your stay.

456
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's Ms Kennedy. And why can't you
be my executive secretary?

457
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,953  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We're south of the border.
It's a man's world.

458
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,194  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thanks for everything.
Your job's finished.

459
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I wanna stay.
- Too dangerous.

460
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Enough people are dead.
- Don't talk to me about danger.

461
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:26,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I won't be safe until Sanchez is dead.
Besides, you could use my help.

462
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
If you're gonna stay and be my executive
secretary, you'd better look the part.

463
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Here. Buy yourself some decent clothes.

464
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
What bank does Sanchez use?
I need to make a deposit.

465
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The biggest one in town.
Banco de lsthmus. He owns it.

466
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- (knocking)
- Adelante.

467
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Senor Bond.

468
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I've come to make a small deposit.
- My people downstairs are capable of...

469
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Please, sit down.

470
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We operate the world's
largest private investment fund.

471
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Our biggest problem...
is what to do with all the money.

472
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We have a cash surplus
of ten million a day,...

473
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:31,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..which we ship through our bank
to the US Federal Reserve,...

474
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:36,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..thus establishing credits which can
be used for any legitimate investment.

475
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You see, someone has to help
the gringos with their trade deficit.

476
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Make out a deposit receipt
for $4,900,000 for Senor Bond.

477
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
S, senor.

478
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And there will be additional
monthly deposits in the same amount.

479
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Of course. We are experienced in
handling accounts of this nature.

480
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Let me pass.
- No. No puede pasar sin permiso.

481
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Tenemos un cliente aqu.

482
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:04,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Senor Montelongo? I'm Miss Kennedy,
Mr Bond's executive secretary.

483
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I'd also appreciate it if you could establish
a line of credit for me at the casino.

484
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Shall we say two million dollars?
- No problem.

485
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have excellent collateral,
and our chairman also owns the casino.

486
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:20,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- A very convenient arrangement.
- We have always thought so, senorita.

487
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Thank you. Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen, and welcome.

488
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is a special night for us.

489
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We want you to know that only
through your generous donations...

490
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,318  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..can the work here at the OMI
continue to progress.

491
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We've learned so much,
but we've only just scratched the surface.

492
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We need your help. We need you to go
to your phones now and make a pledge.

493
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
This is not for me.
This is not for them. It's for all ofus.

494
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Are you OK, reinita?
- I'm fine.

495
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Krest called me from the boat with a story
about somebody ripping him off.

496
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Did you see anything happen?

497
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No, Franz. I stayed
in my cabin most of the time.

498
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- What's the matter, baby?
- You know I can't stand that thing.

499
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I'd like a private table. Blackjack.
- Certainly, Senor Bond.

500
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Would you come this way, please?

501
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Quarter of a million dollars.
- S, senor.

502
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And I'd like to raise
the limit to 5,000 a box.

503
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Put these wonderful
volunteers behind me to work.

504
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Dario'll take you shopping, so tomorrow
you can spend a lot of money, have fun.

505
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Now, give me a little kiss.

506
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You want one too?

507
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
We can raise the price.
22,000 per kilo this month.

508
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I like that.

509
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Yeah, this is Truman-Lodge. 22,000.

510
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:03,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Our goal today is to raise $22,000
from each of our meditation chapters.

511
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's 22,000 each.

512
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Go to your phones.
Please help us. Bless your hearts.

513
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let me have half a million.

514
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen to this. Our wonderful Manhattan
chapel has made a special $500 pledge.

515
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
500 kilos. I...

516
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- I knew they'd go for it.
- This guy cracks me up.

517
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Is Senor Sanchez there?
- Yes, he's right here.

518
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Yeah?
- A British sucker dropped...

519
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..a quarter of a million
and he wants to play no limit.

520
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:47,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Which one?
- Table two. Plays like a real jerk-off.

521
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
That's the guy that flew in in the private
plane. Opened an account at the bank.

522
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Five million dollars... in cash.

523
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Let him play.

524
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Double down.

525
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Split.

526
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:40,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Listen to this. Our Chicago chapel
has received a $1,000 donor pledge.

527
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,956  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- They all accepted the new price.
- (phone)

528
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Senor Sanchez?
- Yes, he's right here.

529
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:50,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
S?

530
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
The British guy is a quarter of a million
ahead. Should I close the table?

531
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
No.

532
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Tell Lupe to come in here.
- Right.

533
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:14,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You have good luck tonight.
Are you gonna share any of that money?

534
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,708  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Miss Kennedy,
get me a medium-dry vodka martini.

535
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Why don't you ask...
- Shaken, not stirred.

536
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(Lupe) Cut.

537
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- You're very professional.
- Used to work here.

538
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Am I going to win or lose?
- Lose. But not much.

539
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Vodka martini qu?
- Shaken, not stirred.

540
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Ah, s.

541
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Looks like your luck has changed.

542
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Is that why he sent you?
- And to find out more about you.

543
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Perhaps I'd better quit for the night.

544
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:16,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You should walk straight out of here,
go to the airport and never come back.

545
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Where's Sanchez?
- Upstairs in his office.

546
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,951  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
He's been there all day. He's planning a
party for some Orientals tomorrow night.

547
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,469  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
And what did you tell him
about the Wavekrest?

548
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Nothing. Now go.

549
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Take me to him.
- Are you loco? You'll get us both killed.

550
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Buenas noches, senor. This way, please.

551

552

We've got a very special offer. You guys
out there, with your beer and popcorn...

553
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Un momento, por favor.
This is almost over.

554
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574

555

Anyone who sends in a $100 pledge...

556
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
..will receive a personally
autographed copy ofmy book.

557
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Lovely view.

558
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:46,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
It's a 49.95 value,
and you get it... absolutely free.

559
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- Bond. James Bond.
- Sit. Please.

560
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
(TV) We need your help.
Bless your hearts.

561
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well-travelled man.

562
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
You did all right at the tables tonight.

563
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
I had the feeling
my luck was about to change.

564
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:17,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Well, it's a wise gambler who knows
when his luck has run out. Why this?

565
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
In my business,
you prepare for the unexpected.

566
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
- And what business is that?
- I help people with problems.

567
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
Problem solver.

568
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,430  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
More of a problem eliminator.

569
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:574
