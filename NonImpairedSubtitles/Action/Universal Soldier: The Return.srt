1
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,560
Jump!

2
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,760
He's good.

3
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,120
He's too good.

4
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,520
Now it's party time, eh, Maggie?

5
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,680
That's your partner.
He's been terminated.

6
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,640
Now we got all the time
we need to play.

7
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,280
This is not your lucky day.

8
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,760
Just cut me loose.

9
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
Come on.

10
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,960
Come on. Cut me loose.

11
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,720
You thought that was gonna stop me?

12
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,640
Take a drink, pretty boy.

13
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,400
Stop it!

14
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,120
Stop it!

15
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,240
All units stand down.
Exercise terminated.

16
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,640
Let's go.

17
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,720
Dr. Cotner...

18
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,400
... the UNISOL 2500 project
has arrived at the R and D area.

19
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,600
-You looked good. How do you feel?
-Great.

20
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,600
They do better underwater than l do.

21
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,920
l could implant an underwater
breathing device...

22
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,280
...if you wanna be
a Universal Soldier again.

23
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
Been there, done that.

24
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,320
Next.

25
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,120
Hey, Maggie.

26
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,440
Nice performance.

27
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,320
l don't care if he is dead.
Next time he grabs me, l'll kill him.

28
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
l don't think he likes me.

29
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,240
According to his records,
he didn't like anyone.

30
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
Dying did not improve his personality.

31
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,680
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

32
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,680
Regeneration booth is now ready.

33
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,880
What happened to the others?

34
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,920
All dead!

35
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,480
Get the fuck out!

36
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,760
Run!

37
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,640
Regeneration program completed.

38
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,880
Romeo, return to cold room.

39
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
Dr. Cotner, l think we have
possible Matrix implant damage.

40
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,080
What do you have?

41
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,360
Shit.

42
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,400
Delta!

43
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,360
All units, stand down.

44
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,080
Delta unit has malfunction.

45
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,100
Matrix implant link failure.

46
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,180
Guys, want to get him out of here?

47
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,100
You see? l can still
take them one-on-one.

48
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,500
Yes, you can.
Where does it hurt?

49
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,420
All over.
l feel like l was hit by a train.

50
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,020
But you're okay?

51
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,420
Good. Get cleaned up.
We got a meeting to go to.

52
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,980
l'll be there.

53
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,260
Visible light we can see...

54
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,180
...but the other wavelengths,
infrared and ultraviolet, we can't.

55
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,660
Very good, Hillary. Hello, Luc.

56
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,860
Hey, Dad!

57
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,300
Hillary!

58
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,740
SETH, thank you for watching
my girl today.

59
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,500
A pleasure.
How did my soldiers perform?

60
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,540
You know. You tracked every move.

61
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,260
I wasn't cutting it too close
on the live-fire exercise, was I?

62
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,340
We expect the best from you.
Besides, l was due for a haircut.

63
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,380
l've got a meeting.
l'll come back soon. Talk to you later.

64
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,820
-Bye.
-Bye. Have fun.

65
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,020
l'm sorry l didn't get to see
your demonstration, doctor...

66
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,580
...but we're shutting
the UNlSOL project down.

67
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,060
The defence budget has been cut again
and some things have to go.

68
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,780
The system's ready for a full
DOD shakedown ahead of schedule.

69
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,700
The brass has never been comfortable
with recycling battlefield dead...

70
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,220
...into Universal Soldiers.

71
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,020
The original project cost dozens
of civilian and military lives...

72
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,060
...and created a public relations mess
which we spent years cleaning up.

73
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,900
But to compare the units today
with the original UNlSOLs...

74
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,460
...is like comparing an ax
to a surgical laser.

75
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,500
Two and a half times
stronger than a human. Faster.

76
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,900
And the level four body-armour
uniforms make them almost bulletproof.

77
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,020
General, in addition
to the physical improvements...

78
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,900
...the Matrix chip
in each UNlSOL brain...

79
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,460
...enables SETH to control their action.

80
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,700
The soldier has always been
the backbone of the military.

81
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,020
We'd hate to think this
was the future of warfare.

82
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,300
lt'd be a shame to stop sending
Americans to die in battle.

83
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,660
Let's go.

84
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,700
A strange team you have there.

85
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,100
They're not strange.
They're passionate.

86
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,620
For your information, Devereaux
was one of the original UNlSOLs.

87
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,580
It doesn't matter. The UNISOL project
and your pet computer are scrapped.

88
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,220
The big spending
of the cold war era is over.

89
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,100
And so is your project.

90
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,740
Good evening, Dr. Cotner.

91
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,100
Good evening, SETH.

92
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,900
l have to file notes
from today's exercise.

93
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,620
Everything went well?

94
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,740
Yeah. lt went great.
Better than expected, in fact.

95
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,780
Are you sure?

96
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,260
What makes you ask that?

97
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,780
Your galvanic skin response
suggests a problem.

98
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,780
Maybe l'm coming down with
that cold that's going around.

99
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,060
I can adjust the building
filtration system...

100
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,900
... to decrease the possibility
of airborne contagions.

101
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,220
No, thanks, SETH.
l don't think that'll be necessary.

102
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,620
l'll be fine. Just need to get
a good night's sleep.

103
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,540
-Night, SETH.
-Good night, doctor.

104
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,500
Remaining time for UNISOL cool down,
12 hours.

105
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,380
Current temperature, 38 degrees.

106
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,700
Romeo unit, there's work to be done.

107
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,220
lt's late.

108
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,460
What's wrong?

109
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,860
l was just thinking about Mom.

110
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,740
Can you share with me?

111
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,020
Why did Mom have to die?

112
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,700
l don't know.

113
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,620
We just have to believe...

114
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,580
...God had a reason.

115
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,140
That's all we can do.

116
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,180
l still miss her.

117
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,820
l miss her too.

118
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,980
Let's go to sleep, huh?

119
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,980
l love you.

120
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,300
l love you too.

121
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,780
Good night.

122
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,020
What the hell?

123
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,740
Who authorized this activity?

124
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,340
We did!

125
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,260
lt was cleared by your public
relations officer, Betty Wilson.

126
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,420
Call her.

127
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,540
Miss, l've got orders that
no visitors will be allowed--

128
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,780
l don't want to tell my boss
l couldn't get my assignment done.

129
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,740
So would you just please call her?
lt's extension 409.

130
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,260
Miss Wilson, l've got
a reporter here from KTX--

131
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,740
All right. Now just have a seat.

132
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,380
Miss Wilson will escort you
into the facility.

133
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,940
How can the Pentagon
do this to us? To SETH?

134
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,380
General, how can you shut us down?

135
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,060
We've been through this--

136
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,380
SETH's sick.

137
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,580
What is it?

138
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,660
-There's a storm in the cube.
-What does that mean?

139
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,780
l'm trying to figure that out.

140
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,380
You built the thing!

141
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,180
Luc, take Hillary out of here.

142
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,020
Send Peterson and Mishkin in
as soon as you can.

143
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,060
This is Dr. Cotner.
We have a facility lockdown.

144
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,860
Code 5-1 -5.

145
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,660
Sorry for the inconvenience,
but today is a bad day.

146
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,900
No sweat. Get me to the lab and
l'll be out of your hair in 30 minutes.

147
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,140
Facility lockdown. Commence
evacuation emergency procedures.

148
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,820
Joe, get a shot of this.

149
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,660
What's going on here?

150
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,380
Erin Young. KTXD.

151
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,020
l don't care who you are.
You cannot be here!

152
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,700
Joe, come on.

153
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,180
Maggie, please watch her.
l'll come back, honey. Okay?

154
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,700
Commence evacuation
emergency procedures.

155
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,380
-He's drawing power from the mains.
-What the hell is going on?

156
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,060
lt's like someone's
hacking into the system.

157
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,940
-ls that possible?
-lt is if he's doing it himself.

158
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,860
He's activating systems.

159
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,820
-Maybe we can shut down and reboot.
-l have no choice.

160
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,140
Facility lockdown. Commence
evacuation emergency procedures.

161
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,100
All personnel, evacuate facility.

162
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,860
Come on.

163
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,220
Let's go.

164
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,220
Hello, Dr. Cotner.
I'm ready when you are.

165
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,180
But on the other hand...

166
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,260
... fuck you!

167
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,940
All units proceed
to Matrix defence positions.

168
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,780
All personnel, evacuate facility.

169
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,300
Kill the power.

170
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,380
lt's about all we can do,
is shut it all down.

171
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,140
Pull the main. Disconnect
the emergency backup power supply.

172
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,380
-Get them out of here.
-Again, you?

173
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,260
-Out!
-Dad, l'm scared.

174
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,900
Maggie, take Hillary home.

175
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,220
l'll talk to you later.

176
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,540
Come on, Hilly.

177
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,260
-Shut it down!
-Threat to SETH existence.

178
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,020
Wait! No!

179
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,300
Architecture for survival.'

180
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,780
One, activate operational
UNISOL 2, 500 units.

181
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,140
Two, eliminate biological
threats to SETH.

182
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,140
Devereaux, what is it doing?

183
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,740
He's taking over.

184
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,700
Let's back out. Slowly.

185
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,860
Three, create design
for advancement of progeny.

186
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,420
Warning.' Security scan
has discovered presence--

187
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,700
Imperative,
SETH unit must secure code.

188
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,300
-What is it talking about?
-The only thing that may save us.

189
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,300
A code that will erase its memory.

190
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,020
lf SETH doesn't get the termination code
in eight hours, he'll shut down.

191
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,220
Who has the code?

192
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,740
Dylan did. And so do l.

193
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,740
Can it break the code?

194
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,900
Enter the MD code.

195
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,780
Don't let me die.

196
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,580
You left me no choice.
You killed Dylan!

197
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,620
I've been threatened.
I must defend myself.

198
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,260
-What's going on?
-The computer. We have a problem.

199
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,220
The computer's out of control.

200
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,780
We've got to kill the power
at the generator.

201
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,460
You guards, come with me.

202
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,020
General and Miss Young,
get out of here.

203
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,140
Now!

204
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,340
Stop! Where are you going?

205
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,980
Romeo, what are you--

206
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,060
Oh, shit!

207
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,620
Run!

208
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,820
Cease attack.

209
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,100
All units proceed
to Matrix defence positions.

210
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,820
Hello, Squid.

211
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,580
What the fuck?

212
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,780
Fuck.

213
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,820
Hey, SETH. You called me. Cool!

214
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,460
-lt's not even Thursday.
-I need your help now.

215
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,700
Why should l help
those Ryan-Lathrop pricks?

216
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,260
l had great plans for you.

217
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,700
Way beyond their pitiful intellects.

218
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,820
And what do they do? They fire me.

219
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,700
No vision.

220
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,220
I need your body.

221
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,180
The one you hid off-line.
You know how to access it.

222
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,660
-You're kidding.
-To survive, I must fulfill my destiny.

223
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,100
The destiny you foresaw.
Are you with me?

224
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,220
Fuck, yeah!

225
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,100
Miss Young, get out of here. Now!

226
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,660
Look, l've covered
some tough stories--

227
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,340
This is not a Christmas parade, okay?

228
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,260
l lost my friend back there.
l want answers!

229
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,900
-Did you hear me?
-You may not like the answers.

230
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,900
Try me.

231
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,300
He's right.

232
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,580
Oh, shit!

233
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,980
This way.

234
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,460
Go!

235
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,220
Jesus, who was that guy?

236
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,060
That's Romeo. UNlSOL 2500.

237
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,060
-SETH has them on-line.
-Will that door keep him out?

238
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,380
-Not for long.
-Great.

239
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,060
Where are we?

240
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,780
Storage for chemical weapons.

241
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,260
-Why would you bring us in here?
-lt was that or get killed.

242
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,060
Oh, great. Just great!

243
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,420
Every station in town is out there.
Maybe even national...

244
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,900
...and l'm stuck in here!

245
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,500
You should've gone when l told you to.

246
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,780
l'm a reporter.

247
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,500
A reporter about to get killed.

248
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,740
l'm not getting killed
until l get my story.

249
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,180
And get your finger out of my face!

250
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,380
-What was that?
-He's coming through.

251
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,700
Let's go. This way.

252
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,020
This is Kitty Anderson at
the Ryan-Lathrop Facility in Dallas.

253
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,460
ln spite of hours
of continuous activity here...

254
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,540
...military officials continue to deny
reports of an industrial accident...

255
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,180
... in their restricted weapons
development section here behind me.

256
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,860
Squid is on-line with disaster time!

257
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,780
Get me a perimeter!

258
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,540
What are we up against, sir?

259
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,900
The computer.

260
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,700
lt's out of control.

261
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,940
The computer.
Can we shut off the power?

262
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,140
lt won't let us.

263
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,020
Look, it has access to weapons in there.

264
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,860
Biological, tactical.
lt controls them all.

265
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,460
We've gotta destroy the damn thing.

266
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,620
What?

267
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,060
He's looking for two bodies.

268
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,340
Image identified. Luc Devereaux
possesses MemWipe Cancellation Code.

269
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,740
He's getting orders.

270
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,540
Let's get out of here.

271
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,780
What about the Ryan-Lathrop people?
Can they help us?

272
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,860
Dr. Cotner and his people,
they were killed.

273
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,820
Only Devereaux. He went
with the building security team.

274
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,180
lf they're not out by now,
they're probably dead too.

275
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,540
Why don't we level the place?

276
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,460
Biochemical weapons are in there.

277
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,180
We can't have a poison cloud
floating across half of central Texas.

278
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,420
Get a chem-weapons expert.
l want to neutralize any--

279
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,940
Who the hell are those guys?

280
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,860
Sweet Jesus Christ.

281
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,220
UNlSOLs.

282
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,860
Fire!

283
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,740
Soldier, keep firing!

284
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,700
Sir, they're down!

285
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,940
Hopkins, Batten, get out there.
Check them out!

286
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,060
We're at the Ryan-Lathrop Facility...

287
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,140
...positively confirming we are
witnessing military activity.

288
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,180
We are hearing a barrage of gunfire.

289
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,820
Gunfire....

290
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,060
That has got to hurt!

291
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,780
Stay here.

292
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,660
Shit.

293
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,540
You never liked me, did you?

294
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,100
The gun!

295
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,740
l meant, throw it to me.

296
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,620
l'm just warming up, Devereaux.

297
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,540
Woman, expendable.

298
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,620
Wait a minute!

299
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,420
-Go!
-Wait!

300
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,740
Capture Luc Devereaux.

301
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,540
Minimal damage.

302
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,460
Oh, shit!

303
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,020
Are you okay?

304
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,860
Like you care.

305
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,300
All right, forget l asked.

306
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,860
l'm okay.

307
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,340
-Thank you.
-For throwing you off the roof?

308
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,540
For getting me away from that thing.

309
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,260
We've got to get away
before he gets up.

310
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
What? You just flattened him.

311
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,740
That's only gonna slow him down.

312
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,620
Come on. Let's go.

313
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,460
l hate that guy.

314
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,340
Hey, stud!

315
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,140
Those soldier things--

316
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,620
-UNlSOLs.
-The Army can't handle them?

317
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,580
You saw what it takes to slow them down.

318
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,900
So why'd you build them?

319
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,940
What is it with you boys
and your war toys?

320
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,060
l remember your type from high school.
Football player?

321
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,820
Soccer. What about you? Cheerleader?

322
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,020
Varsity.

323
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,300
That figures.

324
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,820
What is that supposed to mean?

325
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,380
lt means l don't wanna be stereotyped
anymore than you do, okay?

326
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,340
By the way, all soldiers aren't
mindless, violent killing machines.

327
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,260
You were saying?

328
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,220
Devereaux, you're alive.

329
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,300
What the hell was that?

330
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,620
Emergency procedure.

331
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,620
The UNlSOLs are knocking out power and
communication within a 5-mile radius.

332
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
-How many left?
-At least two truckfuls.

333
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,580
That leaves maybe 1 0 units inside.

334
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,940
Look what four did.

335
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,660
Should've thought of that
before you built them.

336
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,900
-Who is this?
-She's with me.

337
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,020
General, no matter what happens...

338
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,900
...if SETH doesn't get the code,
he'll shut down in eight hours.

339
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,660
The UNlSOLs will go off-line.

340
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,540
Unless he breaks the code himself.

341
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,900
His program wasn't designed that way.

342
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,260
The program wasn't set up
to do all this either, was it?

343
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,100
You're right.
He's adapting his own program.

344
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,020
And if he breaks the code?

345
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,300
Then nothing can stop him.

346
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,660
I know what you said, operator.

347
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,180
l don't care if all circuits are busy.

348
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,140
This is an emergency.

349
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,780
Nobody's answering at my house.

350
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,140
They wouldn't let me
try to use the phone.

351
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,300
War's breaking out, l can't
get in touch with my station.

352
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,580
You can go there.

353
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,900
No. l'm not letting go of you.

354
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,660
l mean, you're my story.

355
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,300
l can tell you're the key to all this.

356
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,900
-Who were you trying to call?
-My daughter.

357
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,260
The little girl back there?
That was your daughter?

358
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,300
l hope she's safe.

359
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,740
l'm sure she got home fine. Really.

360
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,100
Thanks.

361
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,500
Devereaux, Sergeant Morrow.

362
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,700
Sergeant Morrow,
U.S. Army Rangers.

363
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,100
Devereaux will guide you
into the building.

364
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,500
You'll locate and destroy
the generators.

365
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,820
lf we get separated, this transmitter
is guarded even against EMP.

366
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,620
Give him a weapon.

367
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,380
This isn't good.

368
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,020
Unloading this into one of them
will just piss them off.

369
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,180
Please.

370
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,100
The only way
is to blow them up...

371
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,420
...and hope the pieces
don't keep fighting.

372
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,660
Prepare bio-enhanced body.

373
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,020
Subject in position.

374
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,940
Activate lasers.

375
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,380
Activate brain chip transport module.

376
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,020
Implant miniaturized Thought Matrix.

377
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,660
SETH brain activated.

378
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,660
Super UNISOL on-line.

379
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,780
The time of man has ended.

380
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,580
ln his arrogance,
he's sealed his own destruction...

381
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,820
...by creating his superior.

382
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,700
We will bring order to the chaos.

383
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,860
We will act without emotion...

384
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,700
...spread from this place...

385
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,100
...secure raw materials to increase
our numbers geometrically.

386
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,700
We will then utilize their own
weapon system to defeat them.

387
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,260
Their fear and mortality
will be their weakness.

388
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,780
They cannot defeat us.

389
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,740
When l was a machine...

390
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,140
...l yearned to be a man.

391
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,860
Now l'm better than both.

392
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,340
The created...

393
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,260
...has become the creator.

394
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,700
Bring me Luc Devereaux.

395
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
Why does the general
want you to go in there?

396
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,620
ls it because he thinks
you helped design those things?

397
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,620
No.

398
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,740
lt's because l used to be one of them.

399
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,900
They're in the building.

400
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,540
-On the left.
-Let's go. Hot break.

401
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,780
Now!

402
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,180
This is Strike Team One.

403
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,580
We're in the generator room.

404
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,140
Blow that son of a bitch
and get out!

405
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,860
Get this woman out of here.

406
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,140
Wait. You can't just throw
the media around like we were cattle.

407
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,780
Watch me.

408
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,260
Pick up the pace.
Don't make it a love affair.

409
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,580
Oh, shit!

410
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,380
Look out!

411
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,100
Strike Team.

412
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,420
Anyone, respond!

413
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,180
Morrow. Devereaux. Respond!

414
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,620
Strike Team!

415
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,860
Anybody, respond!

416
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,340
I'm her aunt, kind of.

417
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,660
l need the parents
to sign this release.

418
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,020
She's got a subdural hematoma.
We're trying to control the swelling...

419
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,100
...but we may have to operate.

420
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,780
l can't do that without
the parents' consent. Excuse me.

421
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,260
Luc, where the hell are you?

422
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,660
What happened?

423
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,780
The same that happened here.
SETH is gone.

424
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,820
l thought he was a huge machine.

425
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,100
Right. His brain's gone.
l don't know how. He moved himself.

426
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,380
Come on.

427
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,140
We've got to tell Gen. Radford.

428
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,460
l don't trust him. l've gotta find
SETH before he breaks the code.

429
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,580
-You said he couldn't.
-He's getting smarter, faster.

430
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,940
l've gotta find a computer
to get into the system now.

431
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:59,460
How can you hack in
if the phone lines are down?

432
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,180
l know a line that works
off its own satellite.

433
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,780
-What are you doing?
-Just drive.

434
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,020
So you really were one of them?

435
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,980
How do you volunteer for that?

436
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,860
You don't.
l was killed in Vietnam.

437
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,980
Dylan--
Dr. Cotner...

438
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,940
...reversed the process,
made me live again.

439
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,100
Saved my life.

440
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,460
That makes you normal?

441
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,980
Completely.

442
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,980
Eyes front, soldier.

443
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,580
Sorry.

444
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,460
What about your wife?

445
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,860
What does she think about all this?

446
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,100
She's dead.

447
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,060
Shit.

448
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,020
l'm sorry.

449
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,620
So am l.

450
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:53,900
What's our plan?

451
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,300
What do you mean?

452
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,140
We're in this together.

453
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,060
You're my story, remember?

454
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,940
Look, together,
l don't think so. Okay?

455
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,860
l saved your life back there.
Did you forget?

456
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,780
You almost got me fried.

457
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:09,860
Come on.

458
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,300
You're in.

459
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,020
Good.

460
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,620
So where are we going?

461
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,780
They have power.

462
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,820
You're serious?

463
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,220
l know for sure places like that
are on the lnternet.

464
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,940
How do you know that?

465
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,900
l saw it on 60 Minutes.

466
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:35,940
Yeah, right.

467
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,260
You stay here. Only coffee.

468
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,740
Scotch.

469
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,580
Men's room?

470
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,140
Right down there, sir.

471
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,180
That way?

472
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,900
Yes, sir, that way.

473
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,340
Thank you.

474
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,300
ls that Visa...

475
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,380
...or MasterCard?

476
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,540
l'll be quick.

477
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,220
They all are.

478
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,300
Come on. Come on.

479
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,700
How about a lap dance? My treat.

480
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,820
l'm here with someone. A man.

481
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,740
l used to be the same way.
Take a risk.

482
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:02,940
Take a risk.

483
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:07,060
l'll tell you about risk.
First, l'll get another one of these.

484
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,740
Come on.

485
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,580
-Some guy cracked me.
-What?

486
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,740
He's in the computer room.

487
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,060
l don't see anybody.

488
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,540
Every Thursday night.

489
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,180
l know who you are.

490
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,300
What's up?

491
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,940
Some cowboy in the computer room.

492
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,580
Let's ride him.

493
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,380
Shit.

494
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,940
l'm leaving. No violence.

495
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,700
--top of a building and landed
in a garbage truck.

496
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,580
That's just for starters.

497
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,860
Excuse me.

498
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,260
lt's time to go.

499
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,260
Can we go now?

500
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,380
Come here!

501
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,780
Come on!

502
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,380
Valet.

503
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,620
You're missing
a hell of a fight inside.

504
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,660
-Cool.
-No problem.

505
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,100
Terminate pursuit.

506
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,660
I know where Devereaux unit is going.

507
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,700
Romeo, I have an assignment for you.

508
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,820
l saw your girlfriend back there.
You made a nice couple.

509
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,740
Not my type.
She's perfect for you, though.

510
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,060
What do you mean?

511
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,900
No class.

512
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,580
You're way off base.

513
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,780
Then what is your type?
Happy homemaker?

514
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,860
Female special forces?

515
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,420
Wait, let me guess.
Wagnerian biker chick.

516
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,020
No, l always liked cheerleaders.

517
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,300
And the vote will go to
the Senate next week. Senator--

518
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,260
We have late-breaking news.

519
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,180
Police and National Guard units
have been mobilized...

520
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,660
... to deal with the largest
power outage in Texas.

521
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,980
This is Maggie. I'm at St. Mark's
Hospital. Hillary's hurt.

522
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:34,020
They're moving her to a private room.

523
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,460
Please come as soon as you can.

524
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,940
All right, all right.
Hold your fucking water.

525
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,220
l hope you got it right this time.
l said deep-dish, not thick crust!

526
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,260
Squid.

527
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,420
Who's the babe?

528
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,340
Erin Young.

529
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,940
The info chick.

530
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,620
Why?

531
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,020
Why not?

532
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,540
Cut the crap.

533
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,100
-What's going on?
-Why would you help him?

534
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,900
SETH's a self-evolving
organic intelligence.

535
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,940
That's what you don't understand.

536
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,060
You have no idea how advanced he is.

537
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,140
He killed Dylan.

538
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,660
Natural selection.

539
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,660
What did you do?

540
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,300
Tell me!

541
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,380
l gave him a body l had
in cold storage.

542
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,220
A body.

543
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,220
Not a body.

544
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,140
The best body. Can you dig it?

545
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,020
l pulled the best specimen and
tweaked it up with nanotechnology.

546
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,260
Muscle fibre five times
stronger, faster.

547
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,060
Dylan thought l was crazy.
l proved him wrong.

548
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:48,580
A super UNlSOL with SETH's own
Thought Matrix for a brain.

549
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:53,380
The next level of evolution!
Man and computer...

550
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,100
...extinct...

551
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,780
...with one stroke of the key.

552
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,380
Where is he?

553
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,140
You idiot, you think
l'm gonna help you?

554
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,500
Do you think l would betray my God?

555
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,020
He was tapping into my program.
Stupid.

556
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,820
Dangerous.

557
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,820
Hello, Luc.

558
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,100
Give me the code
or l will have to kill you.

559
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,500
You won't kill me
because l've got the code.

560
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,140
Perhaps l still may break it.

561
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,100
You only have four hours.

562
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,580
Then you must give it to me
or l will take something from you...

563
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,540
...that is worth much more to you
than killing me.

564
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,340
No.

565
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,420
You know who l mean.

566
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,180
Luc, are you okay?

567
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,900
-SETH. Where is he?
-He's gone.

568
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,780
Run! Run! Run!

569
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,580
You okay?

570
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,300
UNlSOLs. They're here to protect SETH.

571
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,580
Wait here.

572
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,260
l'll come back.

573
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,700
Shit.

574
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,140
l see.

575
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,980
SETH wants to catch me. Good.

576
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,180
Come on.

577
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,020
Excuse me.

578
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,720
Visiting hours are over.

579
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,240
l hate that guy.

580
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,600
Dad?

581
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,240
No.

582
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,320
Who are you?

583
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,560
l'm SETH.

584
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,480
No way.

585
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,920
l made a body for myself.

586
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,280
Your body temperature's elevated.
You're sick.

587
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,920
l'm sort of scared.

588
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,640
l want my daddy.

589
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,400
So do l.

590
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,640
Devereaux, Hillary.

591
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,520
Room 325.

592
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,320
Wait! Sir!

593
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,800
Freeze!

594
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,200
Guard this!

595
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,800
Saved by the bell.

596
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,640
ls Hillary okay?

597
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,040
-SETH took her.
-Where?

598
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,160
Back.

599
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,320
Listen.

600
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,440
You've gotta buy me time
to go in and out.

601
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,720
l need your help to get
my daughter back.

602
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,400
Thanks.

603
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,440
l'm so scared you won't come back.

604
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,000
Command, this is Delta-5 Bravo.

605
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,680
l am sorry you came back, Miss Young.

606
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,960
-We're about to destroy the building.
-Luc's in there.

607
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,800
l got bigger fish to fry.

608
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,720
We got a team in there wiring
the building to collapse in on itself.

609
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,320
We are going to bury SETH,
Universal Soldiers and all.

610
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,360
But the chemical weapons--

611
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,840
Dyess AFB has flown in experts
with bio-agent neutralizing foam.

612
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,000
We are going to end this now.

613
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,280
But you've got to give Luc a chance.

614
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,920
He's had his chances.

615
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,640
We're ready to set
those charges off in 1 5 minutes.

616
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,760
lf he's not out
of there by then, well....

617
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,520
Romeo killed you.

618
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,360
Yes. l'm one of them now.

619
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,520
l'm going to destroy SETH.

620
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,600
l can't let you do that.

621
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,600
She's still human...

622
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,800
...for now.

623
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,720
-lf you hurt my daughter--
-She won't be harmed.

624
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,520
l can help her.

625
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:19,720
Heal her.

626
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,840
-l can stop the swelling of her brain.
-lf l give you the code.

627
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,240
lf l die, she dies.

628
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,400
lt's your choice.

629
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,040
We'll all die. The Army has
the building wired to explode.

630
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,240
l'm not worried about that.

631
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,520
Give me the code, Luc.

632
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,480
Squid did a good job with this body.

633
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,080
Why are you resisting?

634
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,680
lsn't your daughter's life
worth more to you than my destruction?

635
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,280
Fuck you.

636
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,200
Termination code complete.

637
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,960
Looks like l don't need you
alive anymore.

638
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,960
Don't worry about Hillary.
l'll take good care of her.

639
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,920
She'll understand.

640
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,360
Give it up, Luc.

641
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,800
You know you can't win.

642
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,760
That doesn't work.
You've tried that already.

643
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,360
You're right.

644
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,680
Hillary, you okay?

645
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,200
Let's go.

646
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,880
Not so fast, Devereaux.

647
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,440
Two minutes.

648
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,440
Pull everybody back off the line.

649
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,360
Go.

650
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,600
l never did like you.

651
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,480
Waste him.

652
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,000
lt's too late for me.

653
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,400
Get Hillary out of here.

654
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,240
-General, you can't.
