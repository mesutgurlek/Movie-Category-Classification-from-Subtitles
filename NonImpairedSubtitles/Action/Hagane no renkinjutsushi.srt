1
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,280
Well...

2
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,460
It really does look like the drawing, but...

3
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,290
Isn't she just the cutest thing?

4
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,310
That's definitely not it!

5
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,510
I know that!

6
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,810
We really don't have time for these jokes!

7
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,610
Really...

8
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,770
Where could she be?

9
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,050
East City!

10
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,680
You've arrived in East City!

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,080
Here's the latest news on Scar.

12
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,870
He's still on the run?

13
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,000
What a persistent guy.

14
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,750
Oh my, I'm terribly sorry.

15
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,490
No, it's my fault for not paying attention.

16
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,070
You are wearing some unusual attire.

17
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,010
Are you not from this country?

18
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,920
I'm from Xing.

19
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,200
Oh, my.

20
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,270
Are you here to see the sights?

21
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,880
There's not much to see in East City, is there?

22
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,980
No, I just stopped by because I need to switch trains here.

23
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,730
I'm headed to the North.

24
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,620
The train at Platform No. 3 is headed for North City.

25
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,420
Oh, no!

26
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,320
Thank you for helping me pick up the groceries!

27
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,030
If you are planning on riding with us, please board at once.

28
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,030
Have a safe trip!

29
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,670
Hm?

30
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,660
What a peculiar kitty.

31
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,420
Where did he go?!

32
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,990
I know I heard footsteps...

33
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,790
There he is!

34
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,600
So he was with a middle-aged man with black hair?

35
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,290
Yes. According to the reports, sir.

36
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,820
This is where he was yesterday.

37
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,070
So he's headed West, huh?

38
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,370
We have a few injured, some slightly, others seriously.

39
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,580
Scar must be desperate, too.

40
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,960
But even so...

41
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,960
...he's attracting a lot of attention.

42
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,390
Now, let's head off to work.

43
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,690
Well, whatever.

44
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,580
That has nothing to do with me.

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,650
A funeral, eh?

46
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,120
Yes, it seems so.

47
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,760
It isn't pretty, is it?

48
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,650
When you get old like me, you can't help but think about when you'll be the one getting buried.

49
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,610
What a terrible thing to say, madam.

50
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,370
As far as I can see, you have a long life ahead of you.

51
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,090
Lieutenant General Grumman?!

52
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,010
You said we were going to meet in front of Brigadier General Hughes' grave, right?

53
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,720
I figured it was something serious since you decided to take the measure of last resort.

54
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,370
To be doubly sure, I decided to disguise myself.

55
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,170
Well, I shouldn't have expected less from you, a man so famous for his eccentricity.

56
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,700
Your disguise exceeded my expectations.

57
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,280
Eccentric?

58
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,780
I'll take that as a compliment.

59
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,700
So, what's the matter?

60
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,710
Eastern Alchemy.

61
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,270
We may be able to find something in the Central Library.

62
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,480
Maybe.

63
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,380
Since we can't find the midget,
we'll have to search on our own.

64
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,220
I hope we can at least find some clues.

65
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,500
I see. So the entire upper echelon of Central is guilty, huh?

66
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,490
But you lost far too much in exchange for the information.

67
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,530
You have nothing left if they take away the men you can trust.

68
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,590
You're right, sir. I can't argue with that.

69
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,320
Even Raven, huh...

70
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:22,910
When I was in Central a little while ago, Raven asked me...

71
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,260
"Are you interested in a perfect, immortal army?"

72
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,250
Immortal army?

73
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,180
Was he talking about the Homunculi?

74
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,250
I flat-out rejected him, saying that it was rubbish.

75
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,930
Then soon after,

76
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,350
I was sent to Eastern Headquarters.

77
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,370
Relegated?

78
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,790
Thanks to that, I'm now stuck cleaning up after all the messes in the East.

79
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,230
More on that topic, do you happen to remember the riot in Lior?

80
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,150
The case where the Fullmetal Alchemist exposed the fake priest of Leto's conspiracy.

81
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,740
Yes, I do remember.

82
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,100
Although Lior was thrown into disarray,

83
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,300
the riot was quickly suppressed thanks to the
Eastern Army's rapid response while it was still minor.

84
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,890
But the Central Army intruded on the scene, and the Eastern Army was withdrawn.

85
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,810
Am I right?

86
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,020
Yes.

87
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:36,630
Lior's public order suddenly turned for
the worse when the Central Army entered the scene.

88
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,700
Those guys at Central are really
planning something, aren't they?

89
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,100
I don't even want to think about it!

90
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,730
Can't things be peaceful until I retire?

91
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,960
Again with the jokes.

92
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,120
You're the great Lieutenant General Grumman.

93
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,390
I'm sure you haven't felt satisfied for a second at simply being the head man for a region of the country.

94
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,850
You have the Eastern Army on your side;
full of veteran soldiers who experienced Ishbal.

95
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,610
I had always thought you'd use that secret contact memo when you needed to whine and beg me for help.

96
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,370
But you called me here to get me worked up, huh?

97
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,440
Geez...

98
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,650
Now that things are getting interesting in Central,

99
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:30,130
the flame of ambition in my heart has been lit once more.

100
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,130
Don't get too serious or your makeup will be ruined, madam.

101
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,710
Oh, no!

102
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,770
Are you free after this?

103
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,610
If you don't mind, would you like to join me for a cup of tea?

104
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,640
Oh, no, thank you.

105
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,790
I appreciate the invitation, but...

106
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,770
It's no good.

107
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,330
Why doesn't this place have any good books on Eastern Alchemy?

108
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,120
Maybe I'll just visit Xing and study there instead...

109
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,990
Wait, but there's no way I'll be able to cross that desert with my automail...

110
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,510
There you are, Edward Elric.

111
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,130
M-Major! What are you doing here?!

112
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,840
Shh!

113
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,380
You have to be quiet in the library.

114
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,580
I heard you're after a girl from Xing
who carries around a black and white cat.

115
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,740
Yeah.

116
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,350
Wait, how did you know that?

117
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,310
I heard from Colonel Mustang.

118
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,100
I'm here today on the Colonel's orders.

119
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,710
Apparently, she's headed north.

120
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,610
According to a witness, she was in
East City and was headed north from there.

121
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,840
North, huh?

122
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,970
Okay. If we know that much, it's safe to give it a try.

123
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,050
Thanks a lot, Major.

124
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,110
Tell the Colonel I said thanks, too.

125
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,230
Hang on.

126
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,250
Don't be in such a rush.

127
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,220
Take this with you.

128
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,950
What's this?

129
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,690
It's a letter of introduction.

130
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,160
It may not do you much good,

131
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,160
but you should meet her first.

132
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,280
Meet who?

133
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,630
She resides even farther north than the Northern Headquarters.

134
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,340
A general who guards the Drakma border and holds another name, the "Northern Wall of Briggs"...

135
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,660
...Major General Armstrong.

136
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,670
Hurry!

137
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,700
You've got nowhere to run, Scar!

138
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,400
Where did he go?!

139
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,800
Report this to Headquarters!

140
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,030
That train is headed for West City!

141
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,760
Damn him...

142
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,580
I can't really find much on Eastern Alchemy...

143
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,710
May's long-distance transmutation was awesome.

144
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,950
I wish I could use that...

145
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,940
I should have asked her about it when she was still at Dr. Nox's place.

146
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,950
Ling said that it's used predominantly for medical purposes...

147
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,990
Are you the Fullmetal Alchemist's little brother who wears a giant suit wherever he goes?

148
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,230
Y-Yes...

149
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,870
Amazing!

150
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,860
Wow! Wow!

151
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,860
Thanks...

152
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,400
But you need to keep it down. We're in a library.

153
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

154
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,020
What are you studying?

155
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,960
Eastern Alchemy.

156
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,980
Eastern Alchemy?

157
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,130
It's a form of alchemy used in Xing.

158
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,990
Wow... Xing, huh?

159
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:53,570
But aren't you Elric Brothers skilled enough to be state qualified in Amestris, a nation so advanced in alchemy?

160
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,540
Why are you researching minor forms of alchemy used in other countries?

161
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,060
Huh?

162
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:07,640
I can't exactly say, "I'm looking for a way to get my body back and fight Homunculi"...

163
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,450
Umm...

164
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,440
They say that Eastern Alchemy is used predominantly for medical purposes.

165
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,260
I'm researching to see if there are any other ways human lives could be saved.

166
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,590
Wow! Nothing less to be expected from the Elric Brothers!

167
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,090
Al! Alphonse!

168
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,510
Get your things together! We're leaving!

169
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,660
Brother, you have to keep it down in the library!

170
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,970
Wait, where are we going?

171
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,920
I'll explain the details on the way.

172
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,360
Either way, we need to go.

173
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,150
Go to the hotel and pack.

174
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,100
Whose brat is this?

175
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,930
If you're his brother, it must mean you're Edward, the State Alchemist!

176
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,490
Yeah.

177
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,770
Wow!

178
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,280
So the rumors were true! You really are a tiny alchemist!

179
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,380
What?!

180
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,790
H-Hey...

181
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,540
Say that again...

182
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,290
Come on, say it again.

183
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,470
You're up for a ride.

184
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,790
Want me to blast you to Neptune?

185
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,950
Wow!

186
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,880
So they were right! You get really angry when people say you're short!

187
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,660
Back away from Sir Selim!

188
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,840
You can't shoot him!

189
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,850
Don't tell me... you're Selim Bradley?

190
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,100
The FÃ¼hrer President's son?!

191
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,730
Yup! That's right!

192
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,530
What the heck are we doing here?

193
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,790
Aren't we supposed to be headed north?

194
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,960
Not like it was my choice...

195
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,710
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,330
This boy has admired you for so long, Mr. Edward.

197
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,460
Admired?

198
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,690
Do you like alchemy, Selim?

199
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,580
I do.

200
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:56,540
My dream is to learn alchemy and become a State Alchemist like Mr. Edward.

201
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,220
Admired me, huh...

202
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,220
Wow...

203
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,100
Then, I want to be useful to Father.

204
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,860
Do you love your Father...

205
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,110
...FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley?

206
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,490
Of course!

207
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,130
What's he like?

208
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,870
He's a very noble man.

209
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,510
He perseveres through hard work that would make a normal person cry...

210
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,000
...and works every day with only one thing in mind: the well-being of his people.

211
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,530
I see.

212
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,760
The FÃ¼hrer President does  seem busy all the time.

213
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,160
Yes, he is.

214
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,680
He still plans on working to his fullest in active service.

215
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,730
I'm constantly telling him to retire already, bearing his age in mind.

216
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,810
He's always been someone totally committed to his work.

217
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,190
He can do his job, but he's always been a blockhead when it comes to women.

218
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,830
He was so impolite; I gave him a good slap across the face.

219
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,600
Well, that's where it all started. Then, we started dating.

220
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,750
And our first date was...

221
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,570
Oh, my.

222
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,040
I didn't mean to talk about senseless things.

223
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,270
Father!

224
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,970
What a surprise!

225
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,830
Welcome home!

226
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,750
Thanks, Selim.

227
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,860
Why the surprise visit?

228
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,800
I had some rare free time, so I came to see your faces.

229
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,360
Then, I heard the Fullmetal Alchemist was here.

230
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,550
Hello.

231
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,960
It's been a while.

232
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,710
We just saw each other at Central Headquarters, didn't we?

233
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,590
I see. So you met each other at the library.

234
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,780
Yep!

235
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,970
What, are you trying to say that we don't look alike?

236
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,730
N-No, that's not it...

237
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,470
We're not connected by blood.

238
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,010
We were never able to have kids.

239
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,490
So we adopted him from a relative.

240
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,680
He grew up to become a kind boy who cares so much for his parents.

241
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,240
Stop it, Father.

242
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,040
It's embarrassing.

243
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,940
I'm only stating the truth.

244
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,920
Is something the matter?

245
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,510
N-No, it's just that we only see you when you're working at Headquarters.

246
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,650
So it's just... right, Brother?

247
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,280
I guess we're just stunned to see such a different side of you.

248
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,140
I see.

249
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,350
I, too, have family.

250
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,150
Even someone like me.

251
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,900
Although it's a bit different from your family.

252
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,600
Are you leaving already, Father?

253
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,330
Yeah. It's about time for me to return to the office.

254
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,720
Enjoy your stay,

255
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,220
State Alchemist.

256
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,750
Let's go.

257
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,540
Come visit again!

258
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,790
Okay, thanks.

259
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,680
I don't think his wife or son know that he's a Homunculus...

260
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,650
Anyway, we need to head north! All the way!

261
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,880
We need to get a hold of that midget and
make her tell us the secret behind Eastern Alchemy!

262
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,650
Right!

263
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,780
We'll be there by morning.

264
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,910
Sleep for now.

265
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,410
I see... so you let them get away again.

266
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,770
This is a map of the West, correct?

267
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,160
Yes, sir.

268
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,860
He was last seen...

269
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,970
Here.

270
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,060
And this is West City.

271
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,240
Scar and Marcoh disappeared somewhere in between.

272
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,520
A train must slow down significantly at a curve, correct?

273
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,930
Is it possible for someone to jump off?

274
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,140
I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it's very dangerous.

275
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,240
I see.

276
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,140
Well then, I wonder which direction they ran after they jumped off?

277
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,130
North...

278
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,320
...or south...

279
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,000
Could it be our first time traveling north?

280
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,060
Yeah.

281
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,040
I wonder if we'll be able to see snow?

282
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,430
Snow, huh...

283
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,820
I guess it rarely stuck to the ground in Resembool.

284
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,830
The cat and the mouse.

285
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,040
Insanity and hatred clash in a white world.

286
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,760
The fiercest battle yet opens the gate to a new world.

287
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,260
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

288
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,390
Episode 33, The Northern Wall of Briggs.

289
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,970
Her golden hair is a flame made of ice.
