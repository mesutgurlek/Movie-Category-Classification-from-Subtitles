1
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:24,229
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

2
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:27,274
<i>We have polluted</i>
<i>and peopled this planet</i>

3
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:29,387
<i>to the brink of extinction.</i>

4
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:33,833
<i>We are destroying our world</i>
<i>at a suicidal pace.</i>

5
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:37,113
We need a pollution revolution.

6
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,630
And it's not going to be easy

7
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:42,833
<i>because the world is addicted to petroleum.</i>

8
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:45,387
<i>We have limited resources</i>

9
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,706
<i>and we go to war to protect them.</i>

10
00:01:52,116 --> 00:01:54,152
<i>We need a new technology</i>

11
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:56,192
<i>and this technology</i>

12
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:58,107
<i>can't be sold.</i>

13
00:01:58,196 --> 00:02:00,790
It must be given away

14
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:02,355
to everyone.

15
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:07,026
<i>We are in sight of a dream.</i>

16
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:09,550
<i>There is a solution.</i>

17
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:11,513
<i>The answer</i>

18
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:14,872
is all around us... right here.

19
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:18,312
Water. H2O.
Two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen.

20
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,547
<i>There is enough energy</i>

21
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:23,627
in this glass of water

22
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:26,230
to power the city of Chicago for weeks.

23
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:28,511
It's the hydrogen we're after.

24
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:36,349
<i>This is what happens when we burn it.</i>

25
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:40,108
<i>It's perfectly clean.</i>

26
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:43,313
<i>You can burn it when you want to,</i>
<i>in a car, in a turbine,</i>

27
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:48,993
<i>or in your own basement power supply</i>
<i>next to your water heater.</i>

28
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:52,671
<i>But what if we could release</i>
<i>this energy efficiently?</i>

29
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,634
<i>We will transform the world.</i>

30
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,352
<i>Maybe we start to put an end to war.</i>

31
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:03,394
Of course, we have to make it work first.

32
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:17,267
Morning!

33
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:22,707
Hey, James, how are you doing?

34
00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:24,946
Hey, Eddie, cold enough for you?

35
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:27,027
It's never too cold.

36
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,787
Hey, Lu! You want me to set up?

37
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:37,025
Yeah, right away.

38
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:46,589
Hello, Mr Shannon.

39
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:49,236
Mr Shannon, the big man, how are you?

40
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:53,265
Alistair.

41
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:55,665
- Did you have a good trip?
- Very good.

42
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,828
- Hi, can I get you some coffee?
- I'm fine, thank you.

43
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,670
I turn on the laser here.
We should focus it in the centre of the bubble.

44
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,906
- How's it going?
- You didn't get my fax?

45
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:07,146
I did. I didn't understand the figures.

46
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:09,386
We need to control the bubble.

47
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:11,910
The regulator isn't working.

48
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:14,908
Eddie, did you computer-model
your work last night?

49
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:17,191
No, I was too busy building it.

50
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:20,109
We sustained fusion for 4.6 milliseconds.

51
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:22,187
Stable?

52
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:25,268
It's stable... for 4.6 milliseconds.

53
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:27,153
Let me show you. Come, come.

54
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:32,026
The power input and output
is fine at this stage.

55
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:36,587
The output drops to nothing
at stage three, so what happened?

56
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,667
Paul!

57
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,872
All right, I gotta go.

58
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:52,466
Cross your fingers, everyone.

59
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:54,274
Good luck.

60
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:06,546
Mr Chen. Initiate laser.

61
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:08,945
Initiate laser.

62
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:22,585
Hydrogen separation in progress.

63
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:27,227
Initiate hydrogen burn.

64
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:39,954
Two million kelvin and rising.

65
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:42,795
Shut it down!

66
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,753
It's unstable. Shut it down.

67
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:56,467
We learned something important.
We found another way that didn't work.

68
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,195
We need to keep our minds open
and try again.

69
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:02,227
Alistair.

70
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:04,546
- It's working.
<i>- Is it stable?</i>

71
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:05,989
Yeah, it's stable.

72
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:08,510
- Completely stable.
<i>- My God!</i>

73
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:11,829
- We go tomorrow.
<i>- Tomorrow, Alistair.</i>

74
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:19,749
Lily, talk to me.

75
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:22,748
Temperature, gas flow,
acoustic drive steadied.

76
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:25,669
- The regulator has stabilised the reaction.
- Lucasz.

77
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:28,554
My spectrometer shows
stable hydrogen production.

78
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:32,026
We're getting more out than we put in.

79
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,392
I think you'd better sell your utility stocks.

80
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:11,827
- Whoa, Mr Chidi!
- Unbelievable!

81
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,907
You're going to be famous.

82
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:15,987
Thanks for everything.

83
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,269
We want more money!

84
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:20,153
Thanks for your trust.

85
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:35,274
I got it, I got it!

86
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:36,709
Here comes crazy Eddie!

87
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,905
Congratulations. I am quite impressed.

88
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,146
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

89
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:52,267
I never agreed to keep
anything from anyone.

90
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:56,065
Mandela will get this information,
China will find out...

91
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:58,545
Go anywhere, but don't move an inch.

92
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,026
I can't tell you what could happen...

93
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:04,107
This is no time to be serious.

94
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:05,629
Everybody's waiting.

95
00:09:05,716 --> 00:09:07,707
Come on, Alistair!

96
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:11,587
OK, everybody.

97
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:15,312
Holy shit, we did it!

98
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:17,956
Holy shit, we did it!

99
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:22,712
One love

100
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,185
One heart

101
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:26,834
Let's get together and...

102
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:38,514
Your battery's dead.

103
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:42,474
There's ice all over the dashboard.

104
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:44,672
- How do I get home?
- I'll get you home.

105
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,747
We'll take my bike.

106
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:49,947
Oh, yes, please!

107
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:52,027
Where do you live?

108
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:54,107
I live in England.

109
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:59,915
No, sorry, I live on Kimbark and 54th.

110
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,867
- Kimbark and 54th?
- Mm-hm.

111
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:05,706
We can't. You'll freeze to death.

112
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:07,787
Erm...

113
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:10,787
Let's take a taxi.

114
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,867
- Taxi, huh?
- Uh-huh.

115
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:17,990
We've got a better chance
of getting picked up by a UFO.

116
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:22,953
Mr Chen, upload everything.

117
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:25,106
I want it on the Internet tonight.

118
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:27,027
We'll wake up a lot of people.

119
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:30,108
Damn right. Really wake them up.

120
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:38,506
Barkley...

121
00:10:57,716 --> 00:11:01,948
We don't have the computer model ready.
We have the frequency.

122
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,106
We'll send it to you in one hour.

123
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,347
Yeah, yeah, in one hour.

124
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,392
Where are you going?

125
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:18,392
Chen?

126
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:28,873
- Here we are.
- This is Alistair's house.

127
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:32,187
Isn't he sweet?
He lets me live on the third floor.

128
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:35,029
Mmm. This... way.

129
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:37,471
Is this... is this what drunk is?

130
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:39,706
You've never been drunk?

131
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:41,787
I've never been this.

132
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,707
Lily's too serious.

133
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:47,548
She's no fun.

134
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:49,627
I think you're fun.

135
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:55,067
Good night, Lily.

136
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:00,468
Wow!

137
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:42,754
Alistair!

138
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:47,309
Alistair!

139
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:51,067
Chen!

140
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:17,750
Chen!

141
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:20,469
Chen!

142
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:02,584
Get ready.

143
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:35,305
Shannon.

144
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:38,672
<i>- Paul? Alistair's dead.</i>
- Eddie?

145
00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:40,747
<i>I found him on the lab floor.</i>

146
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,827
<i>- He was murdered.</i>
- What?

147
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:08,864
Just what caused the explosion
last night is still unclear.

148
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:12,949
University officials say
this mill site had been converted

149
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:16,631
for the experimental production
of hydrogen fuel.

150
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:19,310
They say that's not supposed
to be dangerous.

151
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:23,275
One question law enforcement officials
are trying to determine

152
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:25,472
is whether foul play was involved.

153
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:28,024
As we indicate, that's unconfirmed.

154
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:32,746
But an FBI agent has said, and it was reported
by a Bureau spokesperson,

155
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:35,145
that no nuclear device went off.

156
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:37,306
There was no atomic explosion.

157
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,786
As far as you know,
are all your people accounted for?

158
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,867
Miss Sinclair? Is this all the group?

159
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:45,390
Alistair didn't come home last night.

160
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:47,353
Lu Chen is nowhere to be found.

161
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:49,745
I phoned him and he's not anywhere.

162
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:51,827
I started CPR.

163
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,350
I checked for breath, there was no breath.

164
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:56,347
I checked and there was no pulse.

165
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:58,233
I continued with the CPR.

166
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:10,991
Have the locals move
the perimeter back about 1,000 ft.

167
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:12,395
You got it.

168
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:14,546
Find me a friendly Federal judge.

169
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:18,993
I want wiretap orders, search warrants
on everyone that worked here.

170
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:23,035
Inspector Ford, you've taken
charge of this investigation.

171
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:24,754
Why is the FBI involved?

172
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,713
Eight city blocks disappeared.

173
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,026
The President talked to my boss at 3am.

174
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,754
He wants answers.

175
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:47,554
Tell me about Eddie.

176
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:49,194
Does he drink, do drugs?

177
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,665
No. He's just a machinist,

178
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:55,590
an undergraduate working to get his degree.

179
00:17:55,676 --> 00:18:00,113
<i>That's the undisclosed cost</i>
<i>of our cheap fossil fuel.</i>

180
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:02,187
Who'd be interested in this?

181
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:05,234
Cheap, clean,

182
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:06,988
abundant energy?

183
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:09,067
Who wouldn't?

184
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,392
When you left the party, who was there?

185
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:16,875
Eddie.

186
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:21,746
So, Eddie, tell us again why you came back?

187
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:26,908
I'd come back for my bike.

188
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:30,147
You say you'd returned
from taking Miss Sinclair home.

189
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:33,546
Yeah. Her car wouldn't start,
so I took her home on the bus.

190
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:36,389
What is your relationship with Miss Sinclair?

191
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,507
Er... We work together.

192
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,985
I'm a machinist, she's a physicist.

193
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:44,467
I was

194
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:47,627
hired by Dr Chen.

195
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:48,990
And who is Dr Chen?

196
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:51,067
He was Dr Barkley's

197
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:53,750
project manager.

198
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:55,235
Why did he hire you?

199
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:57,307
Because I'm a physicist.

200
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:02,034
Gentlemen, what have we got here?
Sergeant?

201
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:04,232
I think we have Mr Chen in the wind.

202
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:07,154
Nick, what did you find?

203
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:10,626
It looks like he packed with a shovel.
He was in a hurry.

204
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:15,426
Dr Barkley expressed interest
in a specialist in sonoluminescence.

205
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:16,915
He knew about Dr Chen.

206
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:20,272
So through some friends
in the State Department,

207
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:22,347
I got him here and onto the team.

208
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:24,745
You have friends in the State Department?

209
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:29,395
We have influential members of the board.

210
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:30,465
Really?

211
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:32,751
Who's on the board of your foundation?

212
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:35,066
Ford.

213
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:36,555
Various scientists...

214
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:37,466
Yeah.

215
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:38,989
...and industrialists.

216
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:41,032
Your Dr Chen is missing.

217
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:43,311
Any idea where he might be?

218
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,628
He may be dead.

219
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:48,115
We have no comment.

220
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:51,427
Eddie Kasalivich!
You said they killed him.

221
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:52,869
Who killed him, Eddie?

222
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:56,232
You were there before the explosion.
What happened?

223
00:19:56,316 --> 00:19:58,546
What are you looking for?

224
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:01,867
We're just examining
the articles on his desk.

225
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:04,470
- How are you entitled to do that?
- Annette!

226
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:08,185
They have a search warrant,
but no respect for a man's life.

227
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,073
I want a full inventory.

228
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:13,671
These are very important,
sensitive scientific papers.

229
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:16,031
- We'll give you copies.
- Signed, please!

230
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:19,991
<i>For two decades, Doctor Barkley...</i>

231
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:23,466
I have to speak
to the university's legal counsel.

232
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,706
Please give Lily any help you can.

233
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:27,787
I can't stay here tonight.

234
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:34,474
<i>Among the missing is Dr Lu Chen,</i>
<i>who the authorities are looking for.</i>

235
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:37,024
<i>He may be considered a suspect...</i>

236
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:40,108
- This is insane.
- They're going to think he did it.

237
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:51,148
Oh, no.

238
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:53,386
- What is it?
- It's from

239
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:56,307
Dr Lu Chen.

240
00:20:57,116 --> 00:21:00,188
He wants me
to bring the rest of the information,

241
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:03,473
all the data and meet him
at the rendezvous in Shanghai.

242
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:12,267
I'm being framed.

243
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:14,827
What are you talking about?

244
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,555
- This isn't from Chen.
- How do you know?

245
00:21:17,636 --> 00:21:20,434
- He doesn't write like this.
- Then who sent it?

246
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:22,507
I don't know who sent it.

247
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:24,794
Where's Chen?

248
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:28,144
You don't think he did it?

249
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:36,987
Let's er...

250
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:39,306
Let's get outta here, OK?

251
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,868
Can I help you?

252
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:02,232
I sure hope so.
We're looking for Mr Paul Shannon.

253
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:04,307
He's on the phone right now.

254
00:22:05,196 --> 00:22:07,312
Excuse me, you can't go in there!

255
00:22:07,396 --> 00:22:08,670
You can't go in!

256
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:11,145
<i>There's a lot to explain.</i>

257
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:13,352
I'll call you back.

258
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:17,227
What now, Agent Ford?

259
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:19,955
We've received Eddie Kasalivich's file.

260
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:24,314
He left college for disciplinary reasons.
He blew the hell out of the lab.

261
00:22:24,396 --> 00:22:27,513
- This is a coincidence!
- You knew he was kicked out of school?

262
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,951
He resigned.

263
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:32,948
- Under some pressure?
- There was some pressure, yes.

264
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:36,187
- He blows up a building...
- Minor structural damage.

265
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:39,234
It was an interesting experiment.
It might have worked.

266
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,672
Didn't you think
this information was important?

267
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:44,951
I don't see the relevance.

268
00:22:45,036 --> 00:22:49,268
- You don't see a small connection?
- No, Agent Ford, I don't.

269
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:52,632
The CIA tells me
Chen might be involved in espionage.

270
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:54,752
Kasalivich's past makes me nervous.

271
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:59,307
And Miss Sinclair is receiving faxes
inviting her to mainland China.

272
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:06,547
Really?

273
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:10,271
Really.

274
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,349
What's wrong?

275
00:23:31,796 --> 00:23:33,787
That's my place.

276
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:37,068
Let's get outta here.

277
00:23:46,556 --> 00:23:49,787
- It's a real shithole.
- How much does this guy make?

278
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,867
Not much, he's a student machinist.

279
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,595
- Sheen, why are you outside?
- Stay warm, buddy!

280
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:57,031
Got a loft for your mother.
Very artistic.

281
00:23:57,116 --> 00:24:00,153
- Who's upstairs?
- Everybody. Half the city.

282
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,954
- Do you want to check that cabinet?
- I got it.

283
00:24:08,036 --> 00:24:11,108
Jesus, you could put together
almost anything here.

284
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:12,390
I want all this.

285
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:15,548
All right! We need a total lab workup.

286
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:18,474
It's er... a neutron cappuccino machine.

287
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,946
Yeah, don't touch it.

288
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:30,355
Hey, Nick! What's this?

289
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,427
It's a transmitter.

290
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:34,666
It's a burst transmitter.

291
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:36,075
What does it do?

292
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:39,626
It sends massive amounts
of information by satellite

293
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:41,593
probably to China.

294
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:51,667
Nick! Doyle!

295
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:56,147
<i>Calls flooded into</i>
<i>the University Of Chicago</i>

296
00:24:56,236 --> 00:24:59,626
<i>from all over the world,</i>
<i>enquiring about the professor.</i>

297
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:02,788

<i>the Royal Academy in London,</i>

<i>he was involved with</i>

302

Paul.

303
00:25:33,996 --> 00:25:34,985
Shannon!

304
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,227
What's going on?

305
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:42,072
Tell me about the money, Eddie.

306
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:43,191
What money?

307
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:46,154
The $250,000 the FBI found in your loft.

308
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:49,870
I don't know what you're talking about.

309
00:25:49,956 --> 00:25:52,834
What about the burst transmitter?
Think hard.

310
00:25:54,796 --> 00:25:56,752
Jesus...

311
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:59,987
I suppose you're not in communication
with Dr Chen in China?

312
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:01,873
It wasn't Chen.

313
00:26:01,956 --> 00:26:04,151
- Do you have an attorney?
- No.

314
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:06,227
I've got a good one.

315
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:09,865
He'll negotiate your surrender.
Come on. We'll call him.

316
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:12,470
- Surrender?
- They'll want to talk to you.

317
00:26:12,556 --> 00:26:14,467
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?

318
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:17,070
- We didn't do anything.
- The FBI will figure that out.

319
00:26:17,156 --> 00:26:20,705
We're being set up. I'm not going
to the cops until I know more.

320
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:24,630
Run, and you'll have
every gun-carrying idiot in the US after you.

321
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,865
Look,

322
00:26:25,956 --> 00:26:27,708
talk to this lawyer.

323
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,787
We'll go somewhere safe

324
00:26:29,876 --> 00:26:32,185
- and wait until you work it out.
- Where?

325
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:34,028
Maggie's.

326
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:35,754
We'll go to Maggie's.

327
00:26:35,836 --> 00:26:39,306
OK. Have you got any money?

328
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:41,273
- $40.
- All right.

329
00:26:41,356 --> 00:26:42,345
Here.

330
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:46,668
When you get there, stay put.
Don't use the phone. I'll call you.

331
00:26:51,396 --> 00:26:53,387
Why is this happening, Paul?

332
00:26:54,276 --> 00:26:56,267
It's gonna be all right, Eddie.

333
00:26:56,356 --> 00:26:58,347
I promise you.

334
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:01,265
Wait here five minutes, then leave.

335
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:09,708
What do we know about this Shannon?

336
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,868
Georgetown Law,
Kennedy School of Government.

337
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:15,675
Worked for several aerospace giants.

338
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:18,111
Three years in Washington
under Reagan...

339
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:20,187
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?
- DARPA.

340
00:27:20,276 --> 00:27:22,665
Defence Advanced Research
Project Administration.

341
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,475
Jesus! Who the hell is this guy?

342
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:28,787
He's notjust someone that runs a foundation.

343
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:39,233
There's a train at 8.40
at the Union Station to Williams Bay.

344
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:42,035
- That's where Maggie lives.
- You can trust her?

345
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:43,674
We lived and worked together.

346
00:27:43,756 --> 00:27:46,634
<i>This is the Channel 32 special report.</i>

347
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:50,552
<i>We go live to the Federal Office Building</i>
<i>in Chicago.</i>

348
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:54,868
<i>As you know, it's been</i>
<i>a very long and a very trying day for us all.</i>

349
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:59,311
Material witness warrants
have been issued in Illinois

350
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:01,466
for Professor Lu Chen,

351
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:06,031
<i>Dr Lily Sinclair, and Edward Kasalivich.</i>

352
00:28:06,996 --> 00:28:08,987
Oh, my God!

353
00:28:09,116 --> 00:28:13,394
<i>If anyone knows their whereabouts,</i>
<i>please contact the Chicago FBI office.</i>

354
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:16,991
What are we going to do?
We can't leave here together.

355
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:22,511
Get a cab outside. Buy two tickets.

356
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:25,315
Williams Bay. I'll meet you on the track.

357
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:30,195
Be safe.

358
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:31,948
You too.

359
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:37,075
<i>His body was found...</i>

360
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:40,114
Hey, Mike, did you see that guy?

361
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:50,312
Union Station, please.

362
00:28:58,276 --> 00:29:00,585
Hey! Hey, you! Come here.

363
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,435
Hey!

364
00:29:03,516 --> 00:29:04,744
Officer!

365
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:08,471
Hey, buddy!

366
00:29:11,036 --> 00:29:12,264
Hey, you!

367
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:34,715
I got him! I got him!

368
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:40,510
It makes no sense.
If Kasalivich is just a pawn,

369
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:42,587
why has he got a burst transmitter?

370
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:43,995
What?

371
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,146
He's gotta be transmitting to someone.

372
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:48,033
- Unbelievable.
- What?

373
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:50,755
CPD's chasing Kasalivich
down Michigan Avenue.

374
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:09,713
Stay where you are!

375
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:49,154
He's gonna fall! Get me a boat under there!

376
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:54,067
What the hell's he doing?

377
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:04,155
He's going over!
Hey! We got guys downstairs?

378
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:21,831
- What did I tell you? He just went over.
- Stairs, over here.

379
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:28,906
Listen. How do we get him down?

380
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:32,466
Officer, if I move that bridge, he's gonna fall.

381
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:41,985
- Can he get out lower down?
- Leads down to the gear room.

382
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:44,465
- Bring the bridge down.
- He'll get crushed.

383
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:46,626
Ten-four. Bring it down slow.

384
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:13,108
- Bring the bridge down now!
- Get over there!

385
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:44,594
Hey! What's happening? Why did it stop?

386
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:54,267
Right, I want this cleared.

387
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:56,347
Let's go! Do a search!

388
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:25,866
Move it, move it!

389
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:27,514
Go! Go! Right now!

390
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:30,906
You! Back this thing outta here. Come on!

391
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:40,152
So where the hell is he?

392
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:43,712
<i>Amtrak northbound, no.343,</i>

- Watch your step.

397
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:03,115
Don't worry, he'll be here.

398
00:34:17,276 --> 00:34:19,267
You were right.

399
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:25,792
What took you so long?

400
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:27,355
The bridge was up.

401
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:30,026
All aboard!

402
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:51,907
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

403
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:01,147
Thank you.

404
00:35:04,676 --> 00:35:07,270
Are you sure
she's going to be up this late?

405
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,586
Yeah, she's usually up all night.

406
00:35:09,676 --> 00:35:13,305
- She's kinda wild.
- Oh.

407
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:16,035
- I worked up here one summer.
- Oh!

408
00:35:38,476 --> 00:35:40,512
Maggie.

409
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:43,911
Maggie!

410
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,349
Oh, my.

411
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:50,833
Tell me you didn't do it, Eddie!

412
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,634
I didn't do it.

413
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,347
Oh, it's good to see you, man.

414
00:35:59,476 --> 00:36:01,626
You must be the other terrorist.

415
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:04,105
- I guess I am.
- Maggie, this is Lily.

416
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:08,107
Hi, Lily.

417
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:19,752
- Have a nice trip, Mr Shannon.
- Thank you, Bobby.

418
00:36:30,476 --> 00:36:34,628
How did you get me into this hearing?
I don't have this kind of clearance.

419
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:36,547
I know a guy that knows a guy.

420
00:36:36,636 --> 00:36:38,627
- Who?
- It's a guy.

421
00:36:38,716 --> 00:36:40,195
Who's the guy?

422
00:36:40,276 --> 00:36:43,188
Doyle, it's national security. I can't tell you.

423
00:36:43,276 --> 00:36:45,631
Security concerns must be given

424
00:36:45,716 --> 00:36:48,867
greater importance in industrial research.

425
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,789
We don't know the cause of the explosion.

426
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,709
And we don't know
the source of the espionage,

427
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,833
if indeed there was espionage.

428
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:02,467
But we do know that we are at risk.

429
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:08,188
Every idea that offers a competitive
advantage to Americans is subject to theft.

430
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:11,313
And that, gentlemen, could be catastrophic.

431
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,114
Mr Shannon,

432
00:37:13,196 --> 00:37:17,109
over the past ten years,
this committee has approved

433
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:22,554
hundreds of millions of dollars
for your research projects

434
00:37:22,636 --> 00:37:27,585
without having one good,
goddamn idea about where the hell

435
00:37:27,676 --> 00:37:29,667
all the money was going.

436
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:33,032
He's talking about our tax dollars up there.

437
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:35,755
We were under the impression, Senator,

438
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:39,909
that you passed legislation
to ensure that you wouldn't know.

439
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:44,626
Or perhaps, more accurately,
that you didn't want to know.

440
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:48,504
I'm aware of the law, Mr Shannon,
thank you. I wrote it.

441
00:37:48,596 --> 00:37:52,589
But I don't remember,
when I drafted it, that I anticipated

442
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:57,352
a large portion
of the south side of Chicago blown up.

443
00:37:57,436 --> 00:38:01,145
What assurances can you give me
and this committee

444
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:03,955
that this event will never happen again?

445
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:08,267
None, Senator.

446
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:12,828
The incident in Chicago was tragic,
to be sure.

447
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,669
But sometimes that is the price we must pay

448
00:38:15,756 --> 00:38:18,395
to ensure our competitive edge in the future.

449
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:22,071
We didn't intend to pay for
our space exploration programme

450
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:25,387
with the lives of ten American astronauts.
But we did.

451
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:29,788
Nevertheless,
we must not waver in our commitment

452
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:32,913
to scientific research and development.

453
00:38:32,996 --> 00:38:35,510
As you gentlemen know,

454
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:38,474
there are many threats to our way of life.

455
00:38:38,556 --> 00:38:40,911
And not all of them wear uniforms

456
00:38:40,996 --> 00:38:42,793
and carry guns.

457
00:38:42,876 --> 00:38:48,030
Mr Shannon, I want to thank you for your
appearance today before this committee.

458
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:50,471
You have spoken like a true patriot

459
00:38:50,556 --> 00:38:52,945
of whom this country can be very proud.

460
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:56,510
Thank you, sir.

461
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:09,513
- I think I'm getting through.
- What about Lucasz?

462
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:12,713
He never got over
not getting his credentials.

463
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:15,310
No-one on the team could have done this.

464
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:18,672
Whoever is doing this
knows an awful lot about us.

465
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:21,512
If I hadn't have shown up,

466
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:24,793
they would have thought it was an accident.

467
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:27,913
And nobody would know
what's really going on.

468
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:32,028
Oh, my God.

469
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:06,828
- Welcome back, boss. We missed you.
- What about me?

470
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:09,225
Surveillance is up on Shannon's estate.

471
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:11,307
Cue it up, Jimmy.

472
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,554
Where are the files
on the Moore Foundation?

473
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:44,304
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

474
00:40:44,396 --> 00:40:45,511
Shannon's moving.

475
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:37,032
<i>There will be an orientation meeting</i>

476
00:41:37,116 --> 00:41:39,914
<i>in the main auditorium, on level one...</i>

477
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,907
- Is everyone here?
- Yes.

478
00:41:44,996 --> 00:41:47,715
- Is it running?
- Not yet.

479
00:42:01,116 --> 00:42:03,072
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

480
00:42:03,156 --> 00:42:06,034
FBI. I'm Agent Williams, this is Agent Lim.

481
00:42:06,116 --> 00:42:08,505
So, what kind of facility is this?

482
00:42:08,596 --> 00:42:11,349
I'm sorry, sir,
we're not allowed to discuss this.

483
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:25,911
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Bear with me, and we'll soon get started.

484
00:42:25,996 --> 00:42:27,987
Thank you.

485
00:42:28,076 --> 00:42:32,149
I don't care if he's got
an appointment with Mother Teresa.

486
00:42:32,236 --> 00:42:35,387
We have been waiting for him
for 35 minutes.

487
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:37,432
You're late.

488
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:41,595
This is another one of your messes, Lyman.

489
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:43,473
It's not the Peace Corps, Paul.

490
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:47,231
- Anyway, you said you had it under control.
- I did!

491
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:48,874
This thing's still not working.

492
00:42:50,036 --> 00:42:52,345
You've got to call off the Bureau.

493
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,154
Do you understand?

494
00:42:54,236 --> 00:42:56,113
I'm not sure I can do that.

495
00:42:56,196 --> 00:42:59,154
There's an awful lot of explaining to do.

496
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:02,187
Where's the young man?

497
00:43:04,196 --> 00:43:06,187
Kasalivich?

498
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:10,027
He's someplace safe.

499
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:12,107
I'm bringing him in today.

500
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:17,787
Paul!

501
00:43:20,476 --> 00:43:22,831
If someone's going down for this,

502
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:25,111
it is not gonna be I.

503
00:43:32,036 --> 00:43:33,674
Paul Shannon, please.

504
00:43:33,756 --> 00:43:36,554
Maggie McDermott. We're old friends.

505
00:43:37,076 --> 00:43:39,067
Washington.

506
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:42,304
Area code's Wisconsin. Checking the prefix.

507
00:43:42,396 --> 00:43:43,624
Punch it up.

508
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:52,105
Maggie McDermott. She was
put through from the Chicago office.

509
00:43:54,076 --> 00:43:55,828
Maggie?

510
00:43:57,076 --> 00:43:59,032
Shannon, it's Eddie.

511
00:44:01,316 --> 00:44:02,908
It's scrambled.

512
00:44:02,996 --> 00:44:07,114
- It's him, on a payphone in Williams Bay.
- I'll get the locals.

513
00:44:07,196 --> 00:44:11,189
- What are you doing?
- It's OK, it's a payphone. That fax...

514
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:12,550
I know about that.

515
00:44:12,636 --> 00:44:15,196
Wait at Maggie's.
I'll send someone for you.

516
00:44:15,276 --> 00:44:16,789
Lily tracked it to Beijing.

517
00:44:16,876 --> 00:44:19,026
It routed through a Chinese company,

518
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:22,153
but it came from
the US Technological Business Council.

519
00:44:22,236 --> 00:44:23,669
We've gotta go.

520
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:26,065
- Heard of it?
- They'll be there in an hour.

521
00:44:26,156 --> 00:44:27,953
Now, Eddie!

522
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:32,265
- I gotta go. We'll come to you.
- No, don't.

523
00:44:33,076 --> 00:44:34,111
Eddie. Eddie!

524
00:44:34,196 --> 00:44:35,709
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

525
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:45,073
Officer. Hey, hey! Andy!

526
00:44:45,156 --> 00:44:47,750
You know that guy on the news?
I saw him run up there.

527
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:49,508
Really, Maggie?

528
00:44:55,356 --> 00:44:58,507
You should have brought him in
when you had the chance.

529
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,512
Get to the observatory, right away!

530
00:45:32,116 --> 00:45:33,629
Lily! Lily!

531
00:45:33,716 --> 00:45:36,184
- Eddie, it's unbelievable.
- We've gotta go.

532
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:40,349
Listen, listen. This council
lobbies for defence contractors...

533
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:43,553
- We've gotta go now. The cops are here.
- What!

534
00:45:43,636 --> 00:45:45,228
Come on!

535
00:45:45,316 --> 00:45:47,307
How did they find us?

536
00:45:47,796 --> 00:45:50,071
Hey! Hold it right there.

537
00:45:50,156 --> 00:45:52,112
Hey!

538
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:53,868
Hold it! Hey!

539
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:55,548
Stop!

540
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:06,707
Hold it!

541
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:09,105
Stop! Hold it right there.

542
00:46:09,956 --> 00:46:11,150
Get your hands up.

543
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:13,584
Get 'em up!

544
00:46:15,956 --> 00:46:18,231
Walk back slowly towards me.

545
00:46:18,316 --> 00:46:20,307
Come on, do it!

546
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:23,112
Keep coming.

547
00:46:26,156 --> 00:46:27,635
Good, hold it right there.

548
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:35,505
This is Nemitz,
on the roof of the observatory.

549
00:46:35,596 --> 00:46:36,870
I've got 'em.

550
00:46:38,356 --> 00:46:39,550
Aagh!

551
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:49,832
Go! Go, go, go, go!

552
00:46:59,756 --> 00:47:01,792
Come on!

553
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:12,745
On the roof!
Get a medical team up here right away.

554
00:47:12,836 --> 00:47:14,827
Suspect is armed!

555
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:33,115
Get in the boat!

556
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:38,515
- Eddie, what are you doing?
- Get in!

557
00:47:54,756 --> 00:47:56,314
Eddie, what are you doing?

558
00:47:56,396 --> 00:47:58,705
The best I can.

559
00:47:58,796 --> 00:48:00,468
Get the boat!

560
00:48:00,556 --> 00:48:03,024
He's on the ice!

561
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:13,585
- Are you OK?
- Yes!

562
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:49,714
He's out of our sight. 12 o'clock.

563
00:49:00,036 --> 00:49:02,470
Lily, the bag! Give me the bag.

564
00:49:04,796 --> 00:49:06,787
Go, go!

565
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:33,947
There's nobody in there!

566
00:49:38,196 --> 00:49:41,154
<i>We need a pollution revolution.</i>

567
00:49:41,236 --> 00:49:44,433
I don't care.
Search all of Wisconsin if you have to.

568
00:49:44,516 --> 00:49:46,313
They lost him?

569
00:49:46,396 --> 00:49:49,911
We've been to C-Systems.
We can't get any information.

570
00:49:49,996 --> 00:49:54,786
It used to be a government-run facility.
Now county records say it doesn't even exist.

571
00:49:54,876 --> 00:49:56,912
Maybe you weren't really there.

572
00:49:56,996 --> 00:49:58,987
Maybe we're not really here.

573
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:26,355
Eddie, I can't... feel my legs.

574
00:50:26,436 --> 00:50:27,425
Come on.

575
00:50:34,476 --> 00:50:36,467
Come on.

576
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:15,955
We've got fire, we've got fire.

577
00:51:37,036 --> 00:51:40,233
Why would a policeman
shoot another policeman?

578
00:51:42,956 --> 00:51:44,947
Maybe they weren't police.

579
00:51:47,596 --> 00:51:51,305
Why didn't they shoot at us?

580
00:51:51,396 --> 00:51:53,671
I don't know.

581
00:52:03,116 --> 00:52:05,107
What a dump, huh?

582
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,551
- Mr Shannon.
- What?

583
00:52:08,636 --> 00:52:10,354
Two FBI agents want to see you.

584
00:52:10,436 --> 00:52:13,394
This is more important
than his afternoon tea.

585
00:52:18,076 --> 00:52:21,512
My apologies for interrupting
your tea, Mr Shannon.

586
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,350
- What's Kasalivich doing in Wisconsin?
- Running away from you.

587
00:52:25,436 --> 00:52:26,585
We understand he phoned you.

588
00:52:28,658 --> 00:52:30,808
I counselled Eddie
to turn himself in to the authorities.

589
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:35,016
He and Miss Sinclair
shot a Wisconsin state trooper.

590
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:38,010
I doubt that very seriously.

591
00:52:38,098 --> 00:52:41,010
Well... the state trooper's very dead.

592
00:52:42,898 --> 00:52:47,130
Mr Shannon, these are copies
of the Moore Foundation IRS files.

593
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:50,089
Do you know what's in them?

594
00:52:51,898 --> 00:52:53,889
Meagre tax records, I imagine.

595
00:52:53,978 --> 00:52:56,287
We are a non-profit organisation.

596
00:52:57,138 --> 00:53:02,371
The funding for your foundation
comes from a wide variety of sources.

597
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:06,371
Defence contractors,
telecommunication companies, aerospace.

598
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:09,052
It's gratifying to know
our work is appreciated.

599
00:53:09,138 --> 00:53:12,574
The bulk of funding seems to come
from one Cayman Islands account.

600
00:53:12,658 --> 00:53:14,216
I don't do the fundraising.

601
00:53:14,298 --> 00:53:17,176
Oh, yeah. And the account is classified.

602
00:53:17,258 --> 00:53:19,852
Who pays your salary, Mr Shannon?

603
00:53:19,938 --> 00:53:22,247
The foundation pays my salary.

604
00:53:22,338 --> 00:53:24,898
Classified accounts,
encrypted phone calls...

605
00:53:24,978 --> 00:53:30,848
A man could be forgiven for thinking
that your foundation is a front for the CIA.

606
00:53:30,938 --> 00:53:35,853
In that case, there may be national security
issues here that are larger than us all.

607
00:53:35,938 --> 00:53:38,850
Obstructing an FBI investigation
is a federal crime.

608
00:53:38,938 --> 00:53:41,611
- I know the law, Mr...
- Doyle.

609
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:45,008
National security does not include
murdering people.

610
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:46,656
Domestically, at least.

611
00:53:46,738 --> 00:53:49,013
Tell your friends at Langley

612
00:53:49,098 --> 00:53:51,407
that domestic is our back yard.

613
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:53,887
They're not allowed to play here.

614
00:53:55,218 --> 00:53:57,209
You can keep the returns.

615
00:53:59,138 --> 00:54:01,129
Nice house.

616
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:11,853
And for dinner tonight,
we have a choice of sardines...

617
00:54:11,938 --> 00:54:13,735
...or sardines.

618
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,890
Gosh, I think I'll have... sardines.

619
00:54:16,978 --> 00:54:18,969
Sardines. Beautiful choice.

620
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,817
So, is this how you seduce all the girls?

621
00:54:29,018 --> 00:54:33,808
Only physicists with hypothermia
who are accused of being a terrorist.

622
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,015
Thank you.

623
00:54:39,698 --> 00:54:42,929
There's a garage.
I'm going to see what's in there.

624
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:45,213
I won't be long, OK?

625
00:55:00,418 --> 00:55:03,967
Your pit bull has killed
a Wisconsin state trooper.

626
00:55:04,058 --> 00:55:05,457
Well, now.

627
00:55:05,538 --> 00:55:09,133
Would you rather the Bureau
got the girl and Kasalivich?

628
00:55:09,218 --> 00:55:11,209
First, he was a suspect.

629
00:55:11,298 --> 00:55:14,449
Worst case scenario... they arrest him.

630
00:55:14,538 --> 00:55:16,927
Now he's a cop-killer.

631
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:19,486
Worst case scenario, they kill <i>him.</i>

632
00:55:19,578 --> 00:55:23,457
For God's sake, what possessed you
to frame him in the first place?

633
00:55:23,538 --> 00:55:25,096
Two words.

634
00:55:25,178 --> 00:55:27,738
Convenience... and expedience.

635
00:55:27,818 --> 00:55:30,252
He saw too much, he was talking.

636
00:55:30,338 --> 00:55:33,250
The poor boy was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

637
00:55:33,338 --> 00:55:35,329
I need this poor boy!

638
00:55:35,418 --> 00:55:38,728
This poor boy is the only one
who knows the frequencies!

639
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,898
Do you understand the concept, Lyman?

640
00:55:44,698 --> 00:55:46,768
Poor impulse control?

641
00:55:48,538 --> 00:55:52,816
Barkley, Chen, the regulator.
That was supposed to be it!

642
00:55:52,898 --> 00:55:54,889
That was all of it!

643
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:58,609
I am sick to death
of cleaning up your messes.

644
00:55:58,698 --> 00:56:00,529
No, Paul, no. Yours.

645
00:56:00,618 --> 00:56:02,609
Not mine.

646
00:56:02,698 --> 00:56:04,689
You lost it, Paul.

647
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,531
Lost control, perspective.

648
00:56:07,618 --> 00:56:09,893
You made it personal with these people.

649
00:56:09,978 --> 00:56:11,331
Well, we'll find them.

650
00:56:11,418 --> 00:56:15,570
We'll find them, and when we do
and we've got this thing working,

651
00:56:15,658 --> 00:56:17,569
then, my friend, then

652
00:56:17,658 --> 00:56:21,128
this young man will be a liability.

653
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:25,289
That'll be my problem.

654
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:28,415
- Our problem.
- No, Lyman.

655
00:56:28,498 --> 00:56:30,489
When the time comes,

656
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:33,849
I'll handle it.

657
00:56:33,938 --> 00:56:36,168
You'd better.

658
00:57:19,338 --> 00:57:21,613
So what does he want us to do?

659
00:57:21,698 --> 00:57:24,292
We find him and give him an injection.

660
00:58:30,138 --> 00:58:31,935
Lily.

661
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:33,976
Lily!

662
00:59:04,298 --> 00:59:06,289
Come on.

663
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:21,974
Leesburg, Virginia.

664
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,049
C-Systems.

665
00:59:25,418 --> 00:59:27,329
Who are they?

666
00:59:27,418 --> 00:59:28,737
Not cops.

667
00:59:28,818 --> 00:59:30,695
Cops carry badges,

668
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:33,611
credit cards, pictures of their families.

669
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:52,578
If it's crowded, don't go in.

670
00:59:52,658 --> 00:59:54,649
OK.

671
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:12,849
- Hi!
- Hello.

672
01:00:12,938 --> 01:00:14,530
Can I help you?

673
01:00:14,618 --> 01:00:18,611
I'd like to send some flowers
and a note to a friend in Virginia.

674
01:00:20,378 --> 01:00:24,291
It's a little strange, Mr Shannon,
but these just arrived.

675
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:27,609
I'm not quite sure where they're from.
Here's a note.

676
01:00:27,698 --> 01:00:29,689
May I see that?

677
01:00:29,778 --> 01:00:31,769
Thank you.

678
01:00:36,538 --> 01:00:38,130
Hold it right there, buddy.

679
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,015
FBI.

680
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:43,409
Step outside the van, please.

681
01:00:44,418 --> 01:00:47,854
Why don't you bring
your invoice sheet out with you?

682
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:53,776
Do you know if the order
originated at this shop?

683
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:57,009
I don't think so.
I think it was a wire from Georgetown.

684
01:00:57,098 --> 01:00:59,248
- Mind if I take one of these?
- No, sure.

685
01:00:59,338 --> 01:01:00,407
Have a nice day.

686
01:01:00,498 --> 01:01:04,730
So officially this investigation
is now code-named Steel Bomb.

687
01:01:04,818 --> 01:01:07,378
We'll input the data into Rapid Start.

688
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:10,450
Look what I brought back
from the flower shop.

689
01:01:10,538 --> 01:01:12,529
I think this is Kasalivich.

690
01:01:13,898 --> 01:01:17,447
Spawn versus Neanderthal man, 4pm today.

691
01:01:17,538 --> 01:01:19,688
What is this, a wrestling match?

692
01:01:19,778 --> 01:01:21,291
Bad movie, video game?

693
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,608
Spawn, it's a comic-book character.

694
01:01:23,698 --> 01:01:27,657
- The guy who comes back from the dead?
- Yeah, like Kasalivich.

695
01:01:27,738 --> 01:01:30,298
Maybe Shannon is the Neanderthal man?

696
01:01:30,378 --> 01:01:32,289
Very well may be.

697
01:02:18,138 --> 01:02:20,129
Hello, Eddie.

698
01:02:20,218 --> 01:02:22,254
Glad you got the flowers.

699
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:23,612
Very clever.

700
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,689
Are you all right?

701
01:02:25,778 --> 01:02:27,609
No, not really.

702
01:02:27,698 --> 01:02:29,768
I guess I can understand that.

703
01:02:29,858 --> 01:02:31,530
We were at Maggie's.

704
01:02:31,618 --> 01:02:34,371
Caught. We were about to be arrested.

705
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:36,653
Somebody shot the cop.

706
01:02:36,738 --> 01:02:38,933
Later, two guys tried to kill us.

707
01:02:39,018 --> 01:02:41,851
I've got my car outside. Follow me.

708
01:02:41,938 --> 01:02:43,735
We'll go someplace we can talk.

709
01:02:43,818 --> 01:02:46,730
I found this... in one of the guy's wallets.

710
01:02:48,258 --> 01:02:50,055
They weren't cops.

711
01:02:50,138 --> 01:02:52,447
What do you know about C-Systems, Paul?

712
01:02:54,978 --> 01:02:57,617
This is not the time or the place, Eddie.

713
01:02:57,698 --> 01:02:59,450
We're being watched.

714
01:03:03,098 --> 01:03:04,417
Eddie,

715
01:03:04,498 --> 01:03:07,251
the world isn't as simple
as we'd like it to be.

716
01:03:08,738 --> 01:03:10,569
It just doesn't work that way.

717
01:03:11,298 --> 01:03:13,289
Shannon, who are you?

718
01:03:13,378 --> 01:03:15,369
I'm your friend, Eddie.

719
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,653
I may be your only friend.

720
01:03:17,738 --> 01:03:19,569
Is it you, Paul?

721
01:03:21,258 --> 01:03:23,408
Are you responsible for all this?

722
01:03:24,538 --> 01:03:26,529
Time to go, Eddie.

723
01:03:26,618 --> 01:03:28,609
You've got ajob to complete.

724
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:31,688
The experiment needs verifying.

725
01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:34,732
Do your work... This will all be over.

726
01:03:37,578 --> 01:03:39,489
Eddie, we're beyond that now.

727
01:03:39,578 --> 01:03:41,136
Let's just get this done.

728
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:42,731
Come back to work with me.

729
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:45,412
You'll have your life back, I promise you.

730
01:03:45,498 --> 01:03:47,375
You don't control our lives.

731
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:49,608
You'll have to trust me, Eddie.

732
01:03:49,698 --> 01:03:51,654
Just like Alistair?

733
01:04:06,018 --> 01:04:07,246
Eddie!

734
01:04:07,778 --> 01:04:09,131
Eddie!

735
01:04:23,018 --> 01:04:26,488
<i>A trip that normally takes over five hours.</i>

736
01:04:26,578 --> 01:04:31,652
<i>But today, you'll experience the events</i>
<i>of that flight in just seven minutes.</i>

737
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:37,447
<i>The crew is preparing for takeoff.</i>

738
01:04:38,498 --> 01:04:41,615
<i>Your pilot for today's flight</i>
<i>is Captain Dave Larsen.</i>

739
01:04:45,058 --> 01:04:47,288
Stay here.

740
01:04:47,378 --> 01:04:49,608
<i>Our co-pilot is First Officer...</i>

741
01:04:52,418 --> 01:04:54,852
Get in.

742
01:04:57,578 --> 01:04:59,569
She's in the hatch.

743
01:04:59,658 --> 01:05:01,853
Look out!

744
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:09,567
<i>The crew are going through</i>
<i>their final pre-flight checks...</i>

745
01:05:11,818 --> 01:05:12,694
Eddie!

746
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:17,336
Eddie!
Come on, don't do anything foolish.

747
01:05:38,138 --> 01:05:42,450
Get Ford. DC police reported
a disturbance at the Science Museum

748
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,847
by the Neanderthal man exhibit.

749
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:27,854
CQ 493... CQ 493.

750
01:06:41,098 --> 01:06:43,771
Here you are, darling. Drink this.

751
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:46,975
You're dehydrated.
Wash it out of your system.

752
01:06:47,058 --> 01:06:50,892
Mr Collier and I have a few colleagues
we'd like you to meet.

753
01:06:50,978 --> 01:06:54,857
Dr Holloway, Dr Hamada, and Dr Orbit.

754
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:00,733
They are very interested
to discuss your work with you.

755
01:07:00,818 --> 01:07:02,809
And, of course, Dr Lu Chen.

756
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:04,695
Lu.

757
01:07:20,698 --> 01:07:22,689
Lily.

758
01:07:22,778 --> 01:07:24,575
We would like you and Dr Chen

759
01:07:24,658 --> 01:07:27,855
to continue the work
you were doing with Dr Barkley.

760
01:07:31,178 --> 01:07:33,738
- You can't be serious!
- Oh, yes.

761
01:07:33,818 --> 01:07:37,447
We've been impressed with your work
for a long time.

762
01:07:39,258 --> 01:07:42,853
Do you drug and kidnap everyone
whose work you admire?

763
01:07:43,978 --> 01:07:45,297
No.

764
01:07:45,378 --> 01:07:47,938
Dr Barkley, we left behind.

765
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:53,732
Slay the dreamer, eh, Mr Shannon?

766
01:08:07,018 --> 01:08:09,691
You end up sleeping on the street.

767
01:08:09,778 --> 01:08:11,814
I can't believe you'd do that.

768
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:17,973
Can you spare some change?
A quarter, what's a quarter?

769
01:08:18,818 --> 01:08:19,853
Can't you see me?

770
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:33,449
Can I share your grate?

771
01:08:37,098 --> 01:08:39,248
You make me sick!

772
01:08:47,178 --> 01:08:49,408
We can't go in! We got kicked out!

773
01:08:51,058 --> 01:08:53,618
What are all youse looking at?

774
01:08:57,138 --> 01:08:58,537
Let go!

775
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:15,616
CQ 493.

776
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:33,969
<i>This is Eddie. I think. He does.</i>

777
01:09:34,058 --> 01:09:36,049
<i>But he really does.</i>

778
01:09:36,178 --> 01:09:38,692
What are you watching?
"Honeymooner" reruns?

779
01:09:38,778 --> 01:09:41,008
Kasalivich and Barkley. Look at this.

780
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:44,408
Does he look like he's about to kill this guy
and blow the place up?

781
01:09:44,498 --> 01:09:46,489
The whole thing stinks.

782
01:09:46,578 --> 01:09:51,333
We've got the ballistics report back
on that trooper killed in Wisconsin.

783
01:09:51,418 --> 01:09:54,455
Teflon sniper round
went through the cop's Kevlar vest.

784
01:09:54,538 --> 01:09:55,607
I don't buy it.

785
01:09:55,698 --> 01:09:58,007
He's smart enough to blow up the lab

786
01:09:58,098 --> 01:10:01,773
but stupid enough
to leave $250,000 where we'd find it?

787
01:10:01,858 --> 01:10:05,294
Are you saying some cowboy's
gone off the reservation?

788
01:10:07,058 --> 01:10:09,333
$100. The kid didn't do it.

789
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:12,888
You've got a nationwide manhunt
for an innocent man.

790
01:10:13,698 --> 01:10:15,689
Make sure nobody shoots him.

791
01:11:33,578 --> 01:11:35,569
Next shift's going down now, OK?

792
01:12:02,138 --> 01:12:05,130
Yeah, right.
Help me out on this, will you?

793
01:12:05,218 --> 01:12:08,016
I've had problems with the conveyor belt.

794
01:12:09,218 --> 01:12:11,937
No, I'll have Jim Zinsky work on that.

795
01:12:12,018 --> 01:12:13,815
OK? All right.

796
01:12:13,898 --> 01:12:16,856
If you've got any problems,
call me on channel four.

797
01:12:36,058 --> 01:12:38,936
How is our young charge?
Did she say anything?

798
01:12:39,018 --> 01:12:41,009
We'll soon find out, won't we?

799
01:12:41,098 --> 01:12:44,056
The young lady
does appear to be cooperating.

800
01:12:44,138 --> 01:12:45,253
Good.

801
01:12:45,338 --> 01:12:48,455
- Gentlemen, you're just in time.
- Let's get on with it.

802
01:12:48,538 --> 01:12:50,529
Miss Sinclair, Mr Chen,

803
01:12:50,618 --> 01:12:52,609
please, have a seat.

804
01:13:06,738 --> 01:13:09,616
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

805
01:13:09,698 --> 01:13:13,247
<i>Critical path experiment</i>
<i>will commence in ten minutes.</i>

806
01:13:13,538 --> 01:13:16,530
<i>Critical path experiment</i>
<i>will commence in ten minutes.</i>

807
01:13:16,618 --> 01:13:18,609
<i>Level five.</i>

808
01:13:29,098 --> 01:13:31,328
Activate the H2 compressor.

809
01:13:31,418 --> 01:13:33,409
On... on automatic.

810
01:13:33,498 --> 01:13:35,409
Here we go.

811
01:13:38,698 --> 01:13:40,689
Lucasz, what are you reading?

812
01:13:40,778 --> 01:13:43,770
- Two million kelvin.
- Activate the laser.

813
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,449
Four million kelvin.

814
01:14:01,338 --> 01:14:04,216
You don't have it. It's unstable.

815
01:14:04,298 --> 01:14:06,573
Shut it down! Shut it down!

816
01:14:09,218 --> 01:14:12,654
Dammit! What ajoke.

817
01:14:12,738 --> 01:14:15,810
It won't work without the right frequencies.

818
01:14:17,418 --> 01:14:18,612
What did he say?

819
01:14:18,698 --> 01:14:22,134
He said that's what he's been
trying to tell you for days.

820
01:14:22,218 --> 01:14:25,051
Look. Let's try it again in the morning, OK?

821
01:14:25,138 --> 01:14:29,495
- See you back here at 8.15 tomorrow?
- I have a feeling, Dr Sinclair,

822
01:14:29,578 --> 01:14:31,489
the solution will present itself.

823
01:14:31,578 --> 01:14:33,330
I doubt it.

824
01:14:33,418 --> 01:14:34,771
It had better

825
01:14:34,858 --> 01:14:37,816
or your usefulness will soon be outlived.

826
01:14:38,498 --> 01:14:40,295
Take them back to their room.

827
01:14:42,018 --> 01:14:46,170
I wish you wouldn't threaten
to kill my scientists to their faces.

828
01:14:46,258 --> 01:14:48,249
It might make my job easier.

829
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:51,289
Lucasz, Hamada, seal the lab!

830
01:14:51,378 --> 01:14:55,053
I want to see those printouts
first thing in the morning.

831
01:16:36,538 --> 01:16:38,529
- It's working?
- Yes.

832
01:16:38,618 --> 01:16:41,212
- How?
- Lucasz claims he figured it out.

833
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:43,856
Lucasz?

834
01:16:43,938 --> 01:16:45,929
That's his story.

835
01:17:00,858 --> 01:17:05,374
When I got here, the output
was going right through the roof!

836
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,449
Son of a bitch!

837
01:17:08,538 --> 01:17:10,927
It really does work. Ha!

838
01:17:11,018 --> 01:17:13,691
Dr Shannon, take a look at that.

839
01:17:14,498 --> 01:17:16,489
We've got it.

840
01:17:21,818 --> 01:17:23,774
What did you do?

841
01:17:23,858 --> 01:17:25,769
Nothing.

842
01:17:26,338 --> 01:17:28,249
I couldn't sleep last night, sir.

843
01:17:28,338 --> 01:17:30,010
I heard this voice saying,

844
01:17:30,098 --> 01:17:32,407
go and check different frequencies

845
01:17:32,498 --> 01:17:35,331
because we were trying
on 15 and 20 megahertz.

846
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:38,535
So I went down to the lab
and ran the experiment

847
01:17:38,618 --> 01:17:40,768
and it all worked out.

848
01:17:40,858 --> 01:17:43,008
So... here we are, sir.

849
01:17:44,938 --> 01:17:47,771
Did you document
the regulator frequencies?

850
01:17:47,858 --> 01:17:49,849
Not yet.

851
01:17:49,938 --> 01:17:52,816
I'd like those on a disk... Now, sir.

852
01:17:55,378 --> 01:17:57,938
None too shabby, hey, Mr Shannon?

853
01:18:00,178 --> 01:18:03,295
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

854
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:05,096
Where are you going, Paul?

855
01:18:05,178 --> 01:18:08,454
I'm going to check this
against the Chicago data.

856
01:18:12,778 --> 01:18:14,848
I'll try to meet you at the silo.

857
01:18:14,938 --> 01:18:17,247
- Wait as long as you can.
- Yes, sir.

858
01:18:33,898 --> 01:18:35,854
Hello, Eddie!

859
01:18:35,938 --> 01:18:37,929
I figured it was you.

860
01:18:38,018 --> 01:18:40,486
Nice place you have here, Shannon.

861
01:18:40,578 --> 01:18:42,614
Ten-megajoule lasers.

862
01:18:42,698 --> 01:18:44,529
Particle reactors.

863
01:18:44,618 --> 01:18:48,008
Congress de-funded
most of the stuff here years ago.

864
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:50,293
They made a mistake.

865
01:18:50,378 --> 01:18:52,767
Is this part of the Moore Foundation?

866
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:54,371
In a manner of speaking.

867
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:56,210
Power and money.

868
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,368
Is that what this was all about?

869
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:02,610
I'm afraid it's more complicated than that.

870
01:19:02,698 --> 01:19:06,373
He was a 60-year-old scientist
who did nothing but good

871
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:08,449
and they put a bag over his head.

872
01:19:08,538 --> 01:19:10,529
It was a mistake.

873
01:19:12,178 --> 01:19:15,329
I didn't want anything
to happen to Alistair.

874
01:19:16,538 --> 01:19:18,449
But a decision had to be made.

875
01:19:18,538 --> 01:19:20,529
So...

876
01:19:20,618 --> 01:19:22,415
Who made the decision?

877
01:19:22,498 --> 01:19:25,774
- You?
- That's my job.

878
01:19:25,858 --> 01:19:27,849
That's what I'm paid to do.

879
01:19:27,938 --> 01:19:29,929
I'm paid to do dirty work.

880
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:33,526
Work people don't want to know about.

881
01:19:33,618 --> 01:19:35,973
People want to live in split-level homes.

882
01:19:36,058 --> 01:19:38,492
They want microwave dinners
and colour TV.

883
01:19:38,578 --> 01:19:40,296
Is that what you think?

884
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:45,449
Alistair was a dreamer.

885
01:19:45,538 --> 01:19:48,610
Clean air, free energy.

886
01:19:48,698 --> 01:19:50,450
Noble concepts

887
01:19:50,538 --> 01:19:54,053
but we live on a planet
that is addicted to petroleum.

888
01:19:54,138 --> 01:19:57,289
What happens if you dump
free energy onto the market?

889
01:19:57,378 --> 01:19:59,846
World stock markets would plummet.

890
01:19:59,938 --> 01:20:01,974
Our own economy would collapse.

891
01:20:02,058 --> 01:20:03,491
Recession,

892
01:20:03,578 --> 01:20:06,695
unemployment, war.

893
01:20:06,778 --> 01:20:09,246
The world is speeding up too fast now, Eddie.

894
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:11,329
We can barely hold on as it is.

895
01:20:12,538 --> 01:20:14,529
You're right, it's not working.

896
01:20:14,618 --> 01:20:16,813
So we've got to try something else.

897
01:20:16,898 --> 01:20:19,458
Not bury the technology, but let it out.

898
01:20:19,538 --> 01:20:23,531
You let it out, but you let it out
at a pace the world can absorb.

899
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:25,210
It can absorb it now.

900
01:20:27,538 --> 01:20:28,857
There's our boy.

901
01:20:28,938 --> 01:20:30,929
Mr Kasalivich!

902
01:20:31,018 --> 01:20:33,009
How kind of you to join us.

903
01:20:33,098 --> 01:20:35,612
Give us a moment, Lyman.

904
01:20:35,698 --> 01:20:38,258
Eddie and I are having a conversation.

905
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:40,090
Please! Don't let me stop you!

906
01:20:40,178 --> 01:20:43,329
Who runs this place, Shannon? You?

907
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:45,534
- Or the guy with the guns?
- Well,

908
01:20:45,618 --> 01:20:47,609
we are a cooperative

909
01:20:47,698 --> 01:20:49,689
of sorts.

910
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:53,088
Run at the behest
of the United States government.

911
01:20:53,178 --> 01:20:55,089
But without their knowledge, right?

912
01:20:55,178 --> 01:20:59,012
My, my, but your friend is sharp, Paul.

913
01:20:59,098 --> 01:21:00,531
All right, Eddie.

914
01:21:00,618 --> 01:21:02,813
What do you want?

915
01:21:06,018 --> 01:21:08,532
There are the specs for the regulator.

916
01:21:08,618 --> 01:21:11,530
You can pull the frequencies
off the computer.

917
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:12,892
Now let us go.

918
01:21:12,978 --> 01:21:16,687
I get it to work. You give us our lives back.

919
01:21:16,898 --> 01:21:18,968
That was the deal, wasn't it?

920
01:21:21,338 --> 01:21:23,329
Yeah.

921
01:21:23,418 --> 01:21:25,409
Yeah, that was the deal.

922
01:21:25,498 --> 01:21:29,252
I'm afraid, young man,
your position is non-negotiable.

923
01:21:29,338 --> 01:21:31,329
I see.

924
01:21:37,498 --> 01:21:40,137
I want to tell you this story
how I got inspired.

925
01:21:40,218 --> 01:21:42,857
- I had this dream...
- No!

926
01:21:42,938 --> 01:21:43,848
Hold on.

927
01:21:43,938 --> 01:21:45,929
I will continue.

928
01:21:51,938 --> 01:21:53,929
What's happening?

929
01:22:02,978 --> 01:22:04,491
What did you just do?

930
01:22:04,578 --> 01:22:07,536
I just told the FBI I was willing to surrender.

931
01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:12,089
Oh, and er... I think your experiment
just got a mind of its own.

932
01:22:20,138 --> 01:22:22,129
Check the breakers.

933
01:22:22,218 --> 01:22:24,288
Everybody, back to your stations!

934
01:22:30,058 --> 01:22:32,049
What the hell's going on, Doyle?

935
01:22:32,138 --> 01:22:34,971
It started a few minutes ago...
hundreds of pages.

936
01:22:35,058 --> 01:22:38,494
Technical drawings,
experiment specs, budgets,

937
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:42,366
personnel records, minutes,
mostly marked top secret.

938
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,733
- Where's it coming from?
- C-Systems.

939
01:22:44,818 --> 01:22:48,094
It's like they dumped their mainframe
into our computers.

940
01:22:48,178 --> 01:22:50,692
Here's a special love note just for you.

941
01:22:50,778 --> 01:22:52,575
Jesus Christ, Kasalivich.

942
01:22:52,658 --> 01:22:55,968
He's in a bunker in Leesburg
with his bomb-making buddies

943
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:57,650
and wants us to arrest him.

944
01:22:57,738 --> 01:23:01,287
- Lake Geneva Radical Bomb Network?
- Sound like bullshit?

945
01:23:01,378 --> 01:23:03,209
It sounds like you owe me $100.

946
01:23:03,298 --> 01:23:06,096
Make sure that fax doesn't run out of paper.

947
01:23:06,298 --> 01:23:08,175
- Hamada!
- Still off-line!

948
01:23:08,258 --> 01:23:11,455
- Pressure?
- 500 psi and rising.

949
01:23:11,538 --> 01:23:14,006
What the hell's going on?

950
01:23:14,578 --> 01:23:18,127
We've lost control of the system, Lyman.
We can't shut it down.

951
01:23:22,178 --> 01:23:23,406
Turn it off.

952
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:26,376
It's self-sustaining. It can't be shut down.

953
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:29,973
Al! How long before
we run out of storage capacity?

954
01:23:30,058 --> 01:23:31,969
I don't know. It's accelerating.

955
01:23:32,058 --> 01:23:34,128
- 20 minutes before it blows?
- Maybe less.

956
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,288
- Is he right?
- I'm afraid he is.

957
01:23:42,338 --> 01:23:44,135
Well done, Eddie.

958
01:23:44,298 --> 01:23:45,890
Well done.

959
01:23:48,138 --> 01:23:52,017
You wouldn't blow it up
if you weren't sure you'd get out alive.

960
01:23:52,098 --> 01:23:54,248
Sure I would.

961
01:23:55,578 --> 01:23:59,048
Lyman, I think it's time
we got the hell out of here.

962
01:24:03,778 --> 01:24:05,655
- No!
- Chen!

963
01:24:05,738 --> 01:24:07,694
- Lily!
- Chen!

964
01:24:07,778 --> 01:24:09,370
For God's sake, Lyman!

965
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:11,130
Chen! Chen!

966
01:24:12,818 --> 01:24:13,568
Wait!

967
01:24:13,658 --> 01:24:15,808
- Jesus Christ!
- What is wrong with you?

968
01:24:15,898 --> 01:24:19,174
- Turn it off!
- That was totally unnecessary.

969
01:24:19,258 --> 01:24:22,489
If you haven't got the stomach for this,
stay out of the way.

970
01:24:22,578 --> 01:24:24,250
I'm going to turn down the power.

971
01:24:24,338 --> 01:24:26,772
- No!
- Don't touch that!

972
01:24:26,858 --> 01:24:28,371
Don't!

973
01:24:35,218 --> 01:24:37,732
<i>Hydrogen containment failure.</i>

974
01:24:37,818 --> 01:24:39,615
<i>Potential personnel hazard.</i>

975
01:24:39,698 --> 01:24:42,849
- The compressor's just shut down.
- Turn it back on!

976
01:24:42,938 --> 01:24:45,930
- You can't.
- The computers are down.

977
01:24:47,738 --> 01:24:48,773
Get out!

978
01:24:48,858 --> 01:24:50,814
Get out! Everybody!

979
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:54,249
- Fix it.
- I can't now.

980
01:24:54,338 --> 01:24:56,488
- Fix it!
- I can't!

981
01:24:57,458 --> 01:24:59,289
I wouldn't do that, Lyman.

982
01:24:59,378 --> 01:25:01,812
It will ignite the hydrogen.

983
01:25:01,898 --> 01:25:04,856
It's over, Lyman. It's over.

984
01:25:05,778 --> 01:25:07,336
I guess it's time to go.

985
01:25:07,418 --> 01:25:09,807
Go! Go!

986
01:25:11,018 --> 01:25:12,770
Give me the disk.

987
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:14,891
You two, stay!

988
01:25:14,978 --> 01:25:17,617
No, Lyman! Let them go!

989
01:25:18,618 --> 01:25:20,813
What possible difference can it make now?

990
01:25:20,898 --> 01:25:23,935
- They stay!
- When does it end, Lyman?

991
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:25,087
Never.

992
01:25:25,178 --> 01:25:27,169
Well, it's not your decision.

993
01:25:27,258 --> 01:25:30,056
The decision is mine,
and I say they're coming.

994
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:34,131
You can stay with them... if you like.

995
01:25:34,218 --> 01:25:35,446
We must go now.

996
01:25:37,218 --> 01:25:38,571
Well, are you coming?

997
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:42,857
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

998
01:25:42,938 --> 01:25:45,406
<i>Air contaminants at critical level.</i>

999
01:25:45,498 --> 01:25:48,535
Come on, Paul! We've got things to do!

1000
01:25:51,378 --> 01:25:53,050
I'm sorry, Eddie.

1001
01:26:13,618 --> 01:26:16,052
- Shannon!
- Shannon!

1002
01:26:16,138 --> 01:26:18,094
Please!

1003
01:26:18,178 --> 01:26:21,648
<i>Warning! Air contaminants at critical level.</i>

1004

01:26:24,378 --> 01:26:28,530
<i>Warning. Air contaminants at critical level.</i>
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

1006
01:26:28,618 --> 01:26:33,328
<i>All containment doors are now closed.</i>

1007
01:26:41,418 --> 01:26:42,817
The tanks.

1008
01:26:42,898 --> 01:26:45,651
OK, here's the elevator.

1009
01:26:45,738 --> 01:26:47,729
There's room for everybody.

1010
01:26:51,138 --> 01:26:53,094
I'm looking for two men.

1011
01:26:53,178 --> 01:26:56,011
Paul Shannon and Lyman Collier.
Hang onto them.

1012
01:26:56,098 --> 01:26:59,773
<i>Follow the blue evacuation route arrows</i>
<i>to the elevators.</i>

1013
01:26:59,858 --> 01:27:03,214
<i>Move in an orderly fashion</i>
<i>quickly and quietly...</i>

1014
01:27:03,298 --> 01:27:05,493
Our friends from the FBI
will be here presently.

1015
01:27:05,578 --> 01:27:07,534
Anita, we're on our way.

1016
01:27:07,618 --> 01:27:11,406
You two go to the north elevator.
I'll take it from here.

1017
01:27:52,818 --> 01:27:56,015
Come on! Come on, Lily.

1018
01:27:56,618 --> 01:27:58,609
Eddie, which way?

1019
01:28:05,618 --> 01:28:08,086
By the way, Paul, do you have that disk?

1020
01:28:08,178 --> 01:28:10,294
The one with the magic frequency?

1021
01:28:10,378 --> 01:28:12,369
Thank you so much.

1022
01:28:34,338 --> 01:28:37,455
You know, Paul,
maybe it's time to call it a day.

1023
01:28:38,178 --> 01:28:40,453
Maybe you're getting too old for this.

1024
01:28:40,538 --> 01:28:41,937
What do you think, huh?

1025
01:28:42,538 --> 01:28:44,529
But then again

1026
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:46,370
what would we do?

1027
01:28:46,458 --> 01:28:48,449
What would we do?

1028
01:29:27,938 --> 01:29:29,929
I didn't tell you, Lyman,

1029
01:29:30,018 --> 01:29:33,135
but your retirement
had already been arranged.

1030
01:29:50,138 --> 01:29:52,333
<i>Containment systems off.</i>

1031
01:29:53,898 --> 01:29:57,174
<i>Access restored to all areas.</i>

1032
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:59,249
<i>Containment systems off.</i>

1033
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:08,093
Hey, hold on, hold on!

1034
01:30:08,178 --> 01:30:09,452
Take it up, take it up!

1035
01:30:27,378 --> 01:30:29,289
They got a 20 on Kasalivich?

1036
01:30:29,378 --> 01:30:32,848
They found the stolen truck
at the construction site nearby.

1037
01:30:34,978 --> 01:30:36,969
Hold on.

1038
01:30:40,898 --> 01:30:42,297
Eddie, look.

1039
01:31:05,738 --> 01:31:08,093
Get up. Come on, Reed. We've gotta go!

1040
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:26,572
I thought you said the hole was clear!

1041
01:31:26,658 --> 01:31:28,649
Get back in the seat, Ernie.

1042
01:31:34,978 --> 01:31:36,969
Eddie.

1043
01:32:06,338 --> 01:32:08,135
Lily, get in the basket!

1044
01:32:10,898 --> 01:32:13,366
Get out of here. Go!

1045
01:32:14,498 --> 01:32:16,329
Eddie, come on!

1046
01:32:18,178 --> 01:32:19,406
Eddie!

1047
01:32:32,658 --> 01:32:35,092
Hold on, hold on, Eddie.

1048
01:32:48,498 --> 01:32:49,726
Come on, Eddie.

1049
01:33:02,898 --> 01:33:04,092
Aagh!

1050
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:06,897
Come on, Eddie. Come on!

1051
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:24,417
Pull it up, pull it up.

1052
01:33:27,258 --> 01:33:29,055
Holy... did you see that?

1053
01:33:29,138 --> 01:33:30,810
Whoa!

1054
01:33:30,898 --> 01:33:32,616
Come on, get him out of there.

1055
01:34:42,138 --> 01:34:43,696
Eddie Kasalivich.

1056
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:46,133
Agent Ford. You got the message.

1057
01:34:46,218 --> 01:34:48,493
Yeah, we levelled a forest printing it.

1058
01:34:48,578 --> 01:34:50,455
What's it mean, Eddie?

1059
01:34:50,538 --> 01:34:53,974
- Plans for clean, cheap energy.
- Anybody else get this?

1060
01:34:54,058 --> 01:34:56,526
Hopefully, a few thousand top scientists.

1061
01:34:56,618 --> 01:34:59,530
- I knew I liked this kid.
- Yeah, right, Leon.

1062
01:34:59,618 --> 01:35:00,050
Come on.

1063
01:35:00,138 --> 01:35:02,174
You've got some questions to answer

1064
01:35:02,258 --> 01:35:04,169
in Washington for about six weeks.

1065
01:35:04,258 --> 01:35:06,647
- That's OK.
- We've got a lot to talk about

1066
01:35:06,738 --> 01:35:09,172
as long as everyone stops shooting at us.

1067
01:35:09,258 --> 01:35:11,852
Doyle, spilt 'em up.
I'll meet you at the office.

1068
01:35:11,938 --> 01:35:13,007
Ford!

1069
01:35:14,538 --> 01:35:17,336
Doctor Sinclair and I ride together.

1070
01:35:18,498 --> 01:35:20,568
All right, come on, both of you.

1071
01:35:38,698 --> 01:35:40,370
Anita,

1072
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:42,210
take a memo.

1073
01:35:42,298 --> 01:35:44,289
To the Director of Central Intelligence.

1074
01:35:45,378 --> 01:35:47,369
C-Systems...

1075
01:35:48,938 --> 01:35:51,008
no longer a viable entity.

1076
01:35:52,938 --> 01:35:55,088
Will be in contact.

1077
01:35:55,178 --> 01:35:57,169
That's it.

1078
01:40:48,538 --> 01:40:51,006
Subtitles : Filou ;-)
