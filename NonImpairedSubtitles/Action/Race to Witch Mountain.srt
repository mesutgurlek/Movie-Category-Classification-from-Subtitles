5
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,611
[man] The government won't

are visiting our planet.

- [man] Something happened.

proves me wrong,

I'm gonna need something more specific
than just "that direction."

00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,339
We must locate latitude 40.54
cross-intersecting longitude...

We're gonna stick with "that direction."

We tracked the two sets of EBE
footprints on and off for 7.3 miles,

at a rest stop off the highway.

Four hours, 1 9 minutes
post-impact, there was

131

a highway patrol incident report
filed at... the exact same rest stop.

132
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,776
A car trunk was burglarized,
no signs of forced entry.

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,986
Give me something
better than that, Mr. Pope!

Stolen clothing
belonging to a couple of teenagers.

We're in the game. Let's roll with this.

Two kids don't
walk down the highway alone at night.

137
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,205
We got a bus. Landing roughly
at the same time, same rest stop.

138
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,873
Thirty-nine people exit.

139
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,876
Fast-forward to the passengers
re-entering the vehicle.

140
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,463
- Fast-forwarding.
- Stop. Rewind.

141
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,633
Freeze.

142
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,969
There.

143
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,304
Looks like the bus
picked up some extra baggage.

every single surveillance camera

147

Check office buildings,

148
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,692
warehouses,
restaurants, department stores.

149
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,902
Look in sewer systems if you have to.

150
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,906
ATMs! Freeman Street
and Main to be exact. 1 2:45PM.

151
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,870
Bank records indicate they withdrew...

152
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,290
...the entire contents of the machine.
Fifteen thousand dollars.

153
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,084
And also. . . they never used a card.

154
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,588
They never even
touched the machine. Not once.

155
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,341
These EBEs
possess some extraordinary skills.

156
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,428
Bingo! Here's the
cab company security camera.

157
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,139
Keep your eyes
on the back door of the cab.

158
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,059
Right there.

159
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,396
Synchronous satellite feed.
Get me a license plate.

160
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,899
Ground transport, now.

161
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:59,778
And, no matter what
they appear to look like, gentlemen,

162
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,613
they're not children.

163
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,699
They're not even human.

164
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,301
Are your parents gonna be OK
with you guys spending all this money?

165
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,470
We have agreed upon a financial deal.

166
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,722
If your concern
is regarding compensation...

167
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,058
My concern is the fact
that I got a couple of kids

168
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,393
in the back of my cab
with a big wad of cash,

169
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,396
with a drop-off location
that's in the middle of nowhere.

170
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,817
In my book, that's a little chapter
called "running away."

171
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,653
[man on radio] Jack, you better be
getting desert miles on that fare.

172
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,656
And they better be able to pay.

173
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,491
And you better get me an ETA!

174
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,118
- Capisce?
- I'm losing reception, Dominick.

175
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,453
[Dominick] Jack? Jack!

176
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,579
Oh, come on.

177
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,002
Jack Bruno, the vehicles behind us
are indicating a pattern of pursuit.

178
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,921
There's no vehicles following...

179
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,176
At your rate of speed versus theirs,
they will overtake our vehicle...

180
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,428
Relax, kid.
I'm just gonna let them pass.

181
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,942
Open road, people! It's all yours.

182
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,381
What did I tell you?
Nobody's following us.

183
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,717
- I'm the king of these roads...
- Jack Bruno!

184
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,357
I said I was out, and I meant it!

185
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,860
Who is Mr. Wolfe, Jack Bruno?

186
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,946
How do you know that...? [grunts]

187
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,573
Get down, now!

188
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,644
- Hold on.
- [brakes squealing]

189
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,025
He is just a cab driver, right?

190
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,408
Jack Bruno, it would appear
we have not eluded them.

191
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,203
I'm so over this.
Stay down! Stay down!

192
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,665
Seth, no. It's not a good idea.

193
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,042
- I have to try.
- It's too dangerous.

194
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,216
Look out!

195
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,400
Now what?

196
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,368
Get out! Get out!

197
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,954
[moaning]

198
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,206
- Get out!
- [tires squealing]

199
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,627
[panting]

200
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,006
You two OK?

201
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,924
- We are...
- Fine.

202
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,010
We should just keep moving.

203
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,350
Stay here. You didn't get the message?

204
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,228
I told Frank and Marty I was out.

205
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,148
You tell Wolfe for me
that he's gonna pay for my repairs.

206
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,818
You are in way over your head here.

207
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:09,902
[shouts]

208
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,035
I want a complete profile on the driver.

209
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,371
- You think he's collaborating?
- Either way, he's a liability.

210
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,415
Get me some air transport.

211
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,504
How are you two
holding up back there?

212
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,881
We're fine.

213
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,050
I'm sorry I dragged
you two into all this.

214
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,927
There's no need
for you to apologize, Jack Bruno.

215
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,055
You're not always the one to blame.

216
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,558
But the urgency of our trip
has not decreased.

217
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,771
Don't worry. I'll get you two
where you need to go. You've earned it.

218
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:09,003
- We're here, Jack Bruno.
- Here? There's nothing here.

219
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,347
[Jack] Somebody's
expecting you two, right?

220
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,516
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

221
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,603
Don't worry, Jack Bruno.
We'll soon be reunited with relatives.

222
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,775
OK. Seven hundred and 20 dollars
and 50 cents.

223
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,737
But after everything that went down
today, how about I knock off 25 percent.

224
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,822
- Here.
- I also...

225
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,079
OK, then. Goodbye to you, too.

226
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,500
Five hundred percent tip?

227
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,128
That's reasonable.

228
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,882
[sighs heavily]

229
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,139
Hey! You guys overpaid!

230
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,891
By a lot!

231
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,985
- Unbelievable.
- [glass shattering]

232
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,915
Everything OK in there?

233
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,003
[indistinct squeaking]

234
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,025
Hello?

235
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,379
[gasps]

236
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,505
What just happened?

237
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,176
Jack Bruno, you should not have
jeopardized your life by following us.

238
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,802
What sort of trouble are you in?

239
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,014
Return to your vehicle.
Your services are no longer required.

240
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,016
- He's trying to help.
- We don't need help.

241
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,771
Somebody's already been here looking for
it. We simply cannot trust any of them.

242
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,522
Just us, Sara.

243
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,818
We appreciate your efforts
to assist us, Jack Bruno.

244
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,197
But my brother is right.
We can involve you no further.

245
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,032
- Got it!
- Let's go!

246
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,410
- Hey. Just tell me what's going...
- [Seth] This way.

247
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,496
Hurry up, Sara.

248
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,719
[buzzing]

249
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,388
What is that?

250
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,481
Whoa, hey!

251
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,364
Don't go in the pimped-out fridge, Jack.

252
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,991
[whispering] Hey!

253
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,970
[beeping]

254
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,097
[buzzing]

255
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,026
[Jack] What is this place?

256
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,278
- [beeping]
- This way.

257
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,365
Hey, hey. Hey.

258
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,913
[beeping]

259
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,879
- Hey!
- [beeping rapidly]

260
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,424
Sara, it's here!

261
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,661
[gurgling]

262
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,419
- [stuttering] What is it?
- It is what we came for, Jack Bruno.

263
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,422
Really? Is anyone else looking for it?

264
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,550
Say, the person
who trashed everything upstairs?

265
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,593
We think so. It is very valuable.

266
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,637
Which is why it was vital
that we locate it first.

267
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,932
What makes you sure whoever else
wanted it isn't still looking for it?

268
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,059
- [door slams]
- [all gasp]

269
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,107
Shh! Shh! Go. Go. Go.

270
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,526
Go.

271
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,535
[rustling, branches snapping]

272
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,833
Run! Run! Run!

273
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,963
[gasping]

274
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,383
Ah!

275
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,927
Oh!

276
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,180
[grunts, moans]

277
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,340
Ah!

278
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,305
- Jack Bruno!
- Kids!

279
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,108
Go, go, go, Sara!

280
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,821
[both scream]

281
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:35,991
Come on.

282
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,416
Jack Bruno!

283
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,045
Seth!

284
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,884
[Jack yells]

285
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,850
[Sara] Ah!

286
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,066
Come on! We got to go! We got to go!

287
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,833
- [grunts]
- [yelps]

288
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,503
Seth!

289
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,720
- Seth!
- Keep moving! Keep moving!

290
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,766
Go, go, go, go!

291
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,646
[yelps]

292
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,775
Ah! Let's go! Let's go!

293
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,875
Get in!

294
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,254
Ah!

295
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,817
How's your brother doing?

296
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,903
- His system has the ability...
- I will be fine.

297
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,572
It is important we gain much distance
from this location.

298
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,449
I'm happy you're feeling better,

299
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,369
'cause you're gonna need
your strength when you explain

300
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,120
just what happened back there!

301
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,840
Here's the deal: the cab
doesn't move until your mouths do.

302
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,010
- So start talking.
- The information you are seeking

303
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,304
is not within
your grasp of understanding.

304
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,516
We are dealing with issues
outside the realm of... your world.

305
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,059
Hey, I'm a cab driver, OK?

306
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,020
I have had plenty of worldly experi...

307
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,439
Experiences.

308
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,110
[Seth] Sara! We have to go!

309
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,282
What is it?

310
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Hang on!

311
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,501
[Jack] Hold on!

312
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,495
We can't let him destroy it, Sara.

313
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,333
Who is he?
And this time I need real answers.

314
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,669
- It's a Siphon.
- A what?

315
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,757
He's an assassin trained to pursue his
target until his mission is completed.

316
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,384
And his mission is?

his parents died in a car wreck.

At 1 7 he ran away from his foster home

of going from stock car to NASCAR.

for Andrew Wolfe, the Vegas crime boss.

and he's been driving a cab ever since.

Just spoke to

to make contact for several hours.

LoJack. Until it
stopped transmitting 28 minutes ago.

For some crazy reason,

that you're both aliens?

"Take me to your leader, Earthlings."

00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,438
Good. Then we're all on the same page.

472
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,107
Trouble is
the last thing I want as well.

473
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,569
But what I do want,
and I'm counting on you

474
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:51,614
to help me here,
are your two passengers.

475
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,952
What are you gonna do with them?

476
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,912
Do you care this much about everyone

477
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,958
that gets into your cab?
You're a convicted felon, Jack.

478
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,628
You've spent most of the day
breaking one law after another,

479
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,839
for what, for them?

480
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,803
- What do you want me to do?
- Not make a scene.

481
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,765
You walked them into Ray's, you can
walk them out. I'll take it from there.

482
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,560
And to show my appreciation
for your trouble,

483
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,395
I'll wipe your slate clean.

484
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,316
Just walk away, huh?
No harm, no foul?

485
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,234
That's right. Just walk away.

486
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,571
You've got five minutes, Jack,
and then it's all over.

487
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,073
Five minutes. I'll see you then.

488

[rifles cocking]

489
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,667
I don't trust him. Cover all the exits.

490
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,966
They're here for us, aren't they?

491
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,595
Yeah. They are.

492
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,682
- I knew we couldn't trust him.
- Excuse me?

493
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,267
- Too late. We have to run!
- Wait.

494
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,354
I was wondering what your town's
policy is regarding firearms.

495
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,438
Excuse me?

496
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,774
There's a lot of guns
coming in right now.

497
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,156
Come on. Come on.

498

Can I help you boys out?

502
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,890
Official government business.
Excuse me.

503
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,477
Officially my town.
That makes it my business.

Dude, I told you I should have a gun.

Now might not be the best time
to bring that up... dude.

This is not good.

OK.

Or we could do that, whatever that is.

520
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,157
My brother has the ability
to control his molecular density

521
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,660
which allows him
to phase through solid objects

We got an open hatch

We're on our way.

Next time we're in town,
we'll make an appointment.

- You want my card, or...
- No.

Taxi's on the move. I want every
possible escape route locked down.

537
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,300
I want that cab and everyone in it!

538
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,093
Too many of them to outrun.

00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:46,636
Sara, I said... Oh! Absolutely not!

546
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,555
This junkyard is not going with us.

547

Those guys who were
chasing us were the same ones

00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,243
- from the highway, right?
- Yes.

551
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,495
It is vital you take us
to their base of operation.

552
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,414
You want me to take you to
the guys who are trying to kill you?

00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,667
Let me explain to you
how we do things here on Earth.

554
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,169
People who want you dead, you avoid.

00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,923
That way you... mm-mmm... stay alive.
Make sense?

556
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:28,177
No one on your planet will stay alive
if we do not return to our planet.

557
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,513
In order to return, we need our ship.

558
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:34,433
Those men who were trying to kill us
have stolen our ship. Make sense?

00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,190
Where do you suggest
we begin our search?

560

I don't suggest
we begin searching at all.

561
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,362
I do suggest we go back to Vegas
and I drop you off where you got on.

Hey. Easy on the human-bashing, OK?

Some of my best friends
just happen to be human.

Even if I helped,
I wouldn't know where to begin.

I don't know anything
about UFOs or aliens or...

Who's Dr. Alex Friedman?

570
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,637
She's actually somebody who can help.

571
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,974
And, for the record,
she happens to be human.

- Sara.

He would appreciate you pulling over
so that he can relieve himself.

577
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:45,379
We don't have time for that. He should
have went before we left Stony Creek.

578
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,423
He isn't pleased with your attitude.

579
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,175
Really? Is that the way he feels?

580
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,512
You remind him
that I'm a man and he's a dog.

581
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,725
And I'm not about to have this
or any conversation with a dog.

582
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,478
So my answer is still no.

Is there anything else he wants?

586
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:20,206
Oh. He said he would love
a bone or a meaty treat.

587
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,125

Hey.

590
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,602
I need you to keep the cab close
and give the dog some water.

591
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,231
- And, uh, give him a meaty treat.
- [barking]

592
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:36,282
OK. So stay close to me,
don't talk to anyone, nice and normal.

593
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:42,705
I'm telling you.
He walked right past me. Bad move.

594
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,875
This was captured
by a far-imaging telescope

595
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:50,004
at the University of Bonn
less than 48 hours ago.

596
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,465
What I want
to direct your attention to is this.

597
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:58,721
- That looks like a smudge.
- Yes. [laughs] Yes, it does.

598
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,973
Was it a spaceship?
Did they abduct you?

599
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,058
Excuse me?

600
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,894
- Were the aliens the Greys?
- Or the lizard people?

601
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,688
What? No, I wasn't abducted by anyone.

602
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,024
How do you know?
Dr. Harlan's last book

603
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,235
was all about how the aliens
can erase your memory with probes.

604
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,571
- Donald Harlan's book?
- You may have been probed.

605
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,741
- It's pure science fiction.
- [crowd groaning]

606
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:24,038
I am talking about science fact here,
hard data, not crop circles.

607
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,749
Have you ever actually
been inside a crop circle?

608
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,586
I have. It was huge.
It's where the mother ship landed,

609
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,423
where they took me on board,
where I was married to an alien woman.

610
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,259
That is it.
I will not answer any more questions

611
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:41,222
about alien abductions,
crop circles or Dr. Harlan.

612
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,600
Is that clear? If we could just
get back to the matter at hand.

613
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,685
People, hello, excuse me.

614
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,230
I promise it will be worth it.
The blue nebula...

615

The cattle mutilation lecture doesn't
start for an hour. But grab a seat.

618
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,123
This place will be packed. It always is.

619
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,042
- We're here to see you, actually.
- Oh.

620
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,586
It's Jack Bruno. We met earlier.

621
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,421
We did?

622
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:18,134
Cab... airport to hotel... driver.

623
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:22,388
Oh. The nonbeliever. What are the odds?

624
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,390
Is there someplace we can talk?

625
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,394
The, uh... crowds in here
making you uncomfortable?

626
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,229
Even more private than this.

627
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,148
Look, no offense, but I'm pretty busy...

628
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,818
She's doubting her thesis on
Gliese 581 and Alcubierre's warp drive.

629
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:42,408
- How did you know that?
- Oh, it gets a lot better. Trust me.

630
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,705
- [Alex] Are you insane?
- I just thought you, of all people,

631
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,498
would understand and want to help.

632
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,501
Why, because I'm the nutjob
speaking at the UFO convention?

633
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:56,172
- Don't answer that.
- I know it sounds really crazy.

634
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,175
Ya think? Hey.
Please don't touch that.

635
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,177
You captured an image of our ship.

636
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:05,347
The smudge? You're telling me
you think the smudge is your spaceship?

637
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,767
No, we don't think it's our spaceship.
We know it is our spaceship.

638
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,937
That's it. I'm out.

639
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,231
If you'll excuse me,
I'll grab my laptop...

640
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:33,083
Oh. They can also
do all this stuff, too.

641
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,339
Who are you?

642
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,008
Show her.

643
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,089
[chuckles]

644
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:25,094
This is... huge.

645
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,763
I have so many questions,
though you are the answers,

646
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,765
here, standing right in front of me.

647
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,059
[clears throat]

648
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,938
I'm sorry. I'm very excited. Right.

649
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,275
W... Where are you from?

650
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,028
Our planet is located
some 3,000 light-years from Earth.

651
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,448
Space travel of such sizable distance...

652
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,450
Using a paradoxical
passage in the unbounded...

653
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,952
Wormholes. That's it.

654
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,455
[laughs] My presentation at SETI
National Convention was right.

655
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:58,252
Interstellar travel is possible using
wormholes as a shortcut through space.

656
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,713
That was my first guess as well,
the wormholes.

657
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,674
Continue, doctor.

658
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,804
- Why did you come to Earth?
- Our planet is dying.

659
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,639
Millennia of neglect has rendered

660
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,891
- our atmosphere unbreathable.
- Familiar.

661
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,185
Our parents are scientists
who have studied Earth's

662
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,730
climates in hopes of finding
a solution for our planet.

663
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,523
Our people's fears began to rise.

664
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,818
Our parents discovered something
our leaders were interested in.

665
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:26,822
Your planet makes a suitable
living environment for our kind.

666
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:31,827
It would be simplest to abandon
our dying planet and... occupy yours.

667
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,163
Wait. I'm helping you
conquer my own planet?

668
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,750
No. Most of the people on our planet
are fiercely opposed to this plan.

669
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,835
Fear of extinction
triumphed among our people.

670
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,046
But then our parents
discovered a solution.

671
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,466
An experiment at an outpost here
was successful in regenerating life

672
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,551
into all previous
dying plants and trees.

673
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:50,971
Which would enable the re-oxygenating
of your poisoned atmosphere.

674
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,682
- So what's the problem?
- Our military.

675
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,018
They preferred invasion over science.

676
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,854
Which is why we had to hurry
and retrieve the experiment.

677
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:04,360
All proof that our planet can be saved,
and your planet spared, is in here.

678
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,321
- Where are your parents?
- [Sara] They were arrested.

679
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,198
We agreed to complete the task for them.

680
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:13,535
- What about the assassin?
- Assassin? What assassin?

681
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,997
The Siphon warrior series Deraniun 75
was created by our military.

682
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,666
- They're bred to hunt?
- Bred to kill.

683
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:23,128
If we don't return back home in time,
the invasion will proceed.

684
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,590
We seriously need
to find your spaceship.

685
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,808
How well do you know this guy?

686
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,186
We've done a few panels
and debates together on opposite sides.

687
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,647
But no one knows the shadow world of

688
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,483
UFO government conspiracies
better than Harlan.

689
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,986
Not now, Whitley.

690
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,448
Well, hello, Dr. Friedman.

691
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,867
So you've finally decided
to accept my offer

692
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,078
of a romantic Benihana dinner for two.

693
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:59,206
- Huzzah!
- What?

694
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,252
Ahem. Uh. . . Three years ago,
a screening of the Cooper footage.

695
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:06,422
You were in the fourth row,
second seat, in a saucy flower print.

696
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:10,092
Sorry, I keep my work and
social life separate. I don't date...

697
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:13,762
- ...colleagues.
- Colleagues. Indeed.

698
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,557
Listen, we need to see
Harlan right away.

699
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,685
Dr. Harlan is presently
unavailable for consultations.

700
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:22,229
We're more than qualified
to answer questions.

701
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,605
There is no time for that.

702
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:27,192
It is a matter of life and death
that we see Harlan now.

703
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,944
Life and death, ooh!

704
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:33,282
Uber scary drama queen theatrics.
What's the 41 1 sitch?

705
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:37,744
You're currently alive. Unless you
take us to Harlan, you'll be dead.

706
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,874
We should...
Together if you want to. Right now.

707
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,004
[Harlan] Go away!

708
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:51,091
The book signing
is not till 4:30. Read the brochure.

709
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,218
Harlan, it's Alex Friedman.

710
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,060
Dr. Alex Friedman. Quelle surprise.

711
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,980
We have to speak with you
immediately. It is important.

712
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,489
So you're saying the three of you
witnessed this reported UFO crash.

713
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,157
- That's right.
- We were wondering if

714
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,242
there was any intel
amongst your sources.

715
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,954
I hate lying. I really don't like lying.

716
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,249
I can tell when people are lying to me.

717
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:28,003
But, thankfully, your story checks out

718
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:32,049
with all the reports I got from
SETI and NORAD and NASA.

719
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,133
We have reason to believe

720
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,845
government-sponsored operatives
recovered the spacecraft.

721
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,140
OK. Back up a little.
This is not space camp.

722
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,434
Let the experts do their work.

723
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,522
You're very lucky, you two,
that you didn't come face to face

724
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,274
with the aliens who were in that craft.

725
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:54,196
They're like deadly praying mantises.
They eat your flesh.

726
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,282
Oh. Yes, we are, indeed, lucky kids

727
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,827
not to have had our
flesh eaten by the aliens.

728
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:04,373
You got that right.
OK. Let's go to work here.

729
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:08,544
I got an e-mail from a source
that sent me this sat-grab.

730
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,088
Where would they take
the spaceship? 51 ? Nellis?

731
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:15,467
- Wright-Patterson? Vandenberg?
- From the size and scope of the crash,

732
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,220
I would say there's
only one possibility.

733
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,888
- Witch Mountain?
- Witch Mountain.

734
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,140
What, are we a singing group here?

735
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,477
- Let me talk, and you guys nod a bit.
- I apologize. I'm sorry.

736
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,062
Witch Mountain.

737
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:30,566
Let's take a look.
Here we go. California.

738
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,402
About 50 miles
from the border of Nevada.

739
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:37,239
And it's one of our
top-secret facilities.

740
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,908
I got a schematic here someplace.

741
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,828
If you're planning on visiting, don't.

742
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,540
When I say this place
is fortified up to the yin yang,

743
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,709
I'm making an understatement.

744
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:52,337
Here's the schematic.
And do you have the book?

745
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,422
Yes, I do.

746
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,883
All right, then, here's an aerial view.

747
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:00,304
Thank you, Harlan, for everything.

748
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,348
[Harlan] Whatever trouble you're in...

749
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:07,019
...trust no one.

750
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,563
[woman shouting]

751
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,032
Thank you, both of you.

752
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,118
Seth and I understand
you don't have to go forward with us,

753
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:26,246
- and yet you choose to.
- You're welcome.

754
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:31,251
And don't worry.
We're gonna get you home. I promise.

755
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:35,005
I'm gonna grab my stuff. Let's meet
upstairs in the convention, at my booth.

756
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:38,300
- Then we get your cab.
- Alex, uh, listen.

757
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,636
- I can't let you come with us.
- What?

758
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,263
If half of what Harlan says
is true, it's too dangerous.

759
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,307
They got in my cab.
They're my problem.

760
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:49,353
Um, no. I have spent my entire life
preparing for this moment.

761
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,897
Now, when I have two actual aliens
in need of my help,

762
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,148
you want me to walk away?

763
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,109
It's not gonna happen.
Man up, soldier. I'm in.

764
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,154
Just lay low till we meet up.

765
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:02,491
Sure. Great. Lay low.
Easy. How hard could that be?

766
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,079
She thinks you're very handsome.

767
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,832
- Really?
- And smarter than you think you are.

768
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,794
So she was thinking about me?

769
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,380
At least as much
as you were thinking about her.

770
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,510
So she didn't happen to mention
in her thoughts that I was...

771
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,053
It's showtime, everybody!

772
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,306
Space Expo Number Nine.
It's upstairs. Come on.

773
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,726
- Should we go upstairs now?
- Yeah. Let's go upstairs.

774
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,901
Do you think she was thinking about...?

775
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,697
Seth. Sara! Seth!

776
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,908
- Jack.
- I tried to warn you, Jack.

777
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:47,119
Mr. Wolfe doesn't take rejection well.

778
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,708
This is so not a good time.

779
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,502
- Ah! Oh!
- You're out of time, Jack.

780
01:01:55,586 --> 01:02:00,507
Well, well, well. If it isn't
the Rebel Alliance cab driver scum.

781
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,719
Not such a tough guy out
of your ship, are you, womp rat?

782
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,053
You're in our house now!

783
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,306
- Ah!
- [grunting]

784
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,812
Move! Move!

785
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,985
Hi! I'm Sunday.
Welcome to Planet Hollywood.

786
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,571
Are you gentlemen here
for the UFO Space Expo?

787
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,156
Wouldn't miss it.

788
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,162
Seth! Sara!

789
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:39,337
- Wow!
- Costume's great, man.

790
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,715
[man] Whoa!

791
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,969
Seth! Seth!

792
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,013
Sara!

793
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,644
Seth. Sara.

794
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:56,730
I'm sorry.

795
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:10,494
I sure hope we have enough fuelage
to get back to planet Earth, Conrad.

796
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,288
Fear not, Celeste.
We must get to the ship.

797
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:17,959
- [groaning]
- Ah!

798
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,461
[Celeste] My leg!

799
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,714
[Conrad] No!
Look at that beast from another galaxy.

800
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,466
It's so disgusting and scaly!

801
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,301
Didn't I tell you two
to stay by my side?

802
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,594
I heard you the first time.

803
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:30,263
Is this reenactment an important
piece of Earth's history?

804
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,892
- Stand back, you beast!
- No. Come on. Let's go. We got to go.

805
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,562
Jack Bruno.

806
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,861
[applause]

807
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,865
Sara!

808
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,413
Let's go! Let's go!

809
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,333
You're down!

810
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,254
Everybody, down!

811
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,923
Stay down! Stay down! Stay down!

812
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,967
Get down! You, down! Everybody, down!

813
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,885
You with the blue hair, right there!

814
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,264
Best... convention... ever.

815
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,890
[man] Not here! Move out!

816
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,243
Other way. Other way.

817
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:54,180
[gasps]

818
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,231
Sara, are you listening
to what I'm thinking?

819
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:07,569
- [crowd shouting]
- [jackpot alarms blaring]

820
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,197
Go! Go! Move it, move it!

821
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,657
Keep going! Keep going!

822
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,580
Oh. That's me.

823
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:24,294
[jackpot alarms blaring]

824
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:25,754
Got to go!

825
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,341
- What happened to laying low?
- Who lays low in Vegas?

826
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:33,053
Move, move! Get out of the way!

827
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,138
Move it! Get out of my way!

828
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,997
[sirens wailing]

829
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,274
We got them!
Our suspects. No one else interferes.

830
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,319
[man] Do not move! Do not move!

831
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:36,032
Stay inside the vehicle!
Hands where we can see them!

832
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:41,037
Greetings, Earthlings. [laughs]

833
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:11,192
I didn't even imagine they'd actually
look human, much less like kids.

834
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,111
They're lucky you joined us, doctor.

835
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,530
We're lucky... you joined us.

836
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:19,743
Luck has nothing to do with it.
It's pure science.

837
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:23,955
Chaos theory, the underlying order
in apparently random data.

838
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,166
So more like fate?

839
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,544
Mmm... Science. Think about it.

840
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:33,965
What are the odds that they would crash
near Vegas during a UFO convention?

841
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,051
I got in your cab.
Then they got in your cab.

842
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,511
And now we're all
in Harlan's mobile home

843
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:42,891
loaded with his intel on where
their ship is. That is not luck.

844
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,311
That is a predetermined order of
how things work in the universe.

845
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,146
Have you always been this positive?

846
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,357
I have always been
a searcher for answers,

847
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:54,569
though my folks would say
I was merely a daydreamer.

848
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:56,696
How about you?

849
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,949
Me? I'm a, uh,
much easier book to read.

850
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,870
All my life my answers
have been "yes" or "no."

851
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,498
Zero gray areas.

852
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,669
Where does the Mustang fall?
A yes or a no?

853
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,421
That's not just any Mustang.

854
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:17,175
That's a 1 968
Ford Mustang GT 390 Fastback.

855
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,386
Steve McQueen's car in Bullitt?

856
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:24,099
- You've never seen Bullitt?
- Uh, no.

857
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:28,228
Er... It's currently a no.

858
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:31,064
But one day I'm gonna earn
that car, the honest way.

859
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,484
And then it will be my yes.

860
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,989
- Jack?
- What's up, pal?

861
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,659
Are we there yet?

862
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,454
- "Are we there yet?"
- Unbelievable.

863
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,623
Good in any universe, apparently.

864
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,708
- Well, Alex?
- Yes.

865
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:11,855
The maps are 30 years old,
but they're the best intel we've got.

866
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:15,400
Looks to be about five miles
from here to the entrance.

867
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,609
OK.

868
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,195
Let's rock and roll.

869
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,386
[Jack] There's gotta be
another entrance.

870
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,395
If the map's right,

871
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,356
there are several service
tunnels spreading outward.

872
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,650
- Worth looking for, right?
- Let's go.

873
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,362
- [thudding]
- Ah! Jack...

874
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,156
- [Jack] Sara.
- [thudding]

875
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:07,118
- Sara! Seth!
- [indistinct radio chatter]

876
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:13,875
Mr. Bruno and, I believe, Dr. Friedman.

877
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:16,836
- What did you do to them?
- [Henry] Consider yourself lucky.

878
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,505
I could have had you both
shot on sight for trespassing

879
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,799
and violation
of US government property.

880
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,386
Sara!

881
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:30,350
Ah!

882
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:38,900
There you go. All right.

883
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:42,654
Sir. With all due respect,
you have to listen to me.

884
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,990
They came in peace.
We cannot respond with violence.

885
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,034
The future of Earth depends on it.

886
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:50,620
It is absolutely vital
that they get home.

887
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:55,416
They are home, Dr. Friedman.
They are now in my custody.

888
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,754
"Custody?" You can't expect to
keep them prisoner and get away with it.

889
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:03,174
- They have rights.
- They're illegal aliens on US soil,

890
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,759
without so much as a passport.

891
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:09,222
The Patriot Act enables me to detain
them for as long as is necessary.

892
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,266
You can't keep this quiet.

893
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,227
The world has the right
to know that they exist.

894
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:18,314
And you're going to be the one
to blow the whistle, doctor?

895
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:23,695
A failed astrophysicist fired by three
universities for obsessing over UFOs

896
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,698
teams up with an ex-con
in declaring that the government

897
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,159
has captured two normal-looking kids
and is holding them hostage

898
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:33,079
inside a mountain that doesn't exist?

899
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,499
It would be so much easier
to let you speak

900
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:40,712
than to deal with all the paperwork
involved with killing you.

901
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,923
- Someone will believe us.
- From behind bars?

902
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:46,801
Let me remind you, Mr. Bruno,
as a convicted felon,

903
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:50,805
you're looking at 20 years just for
standing on this mountain talking to me.

904
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,056
Shall I go on?

905
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,727
No. I get the message.

906
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:00,815
Smart man. Give them a lift back down.

907
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:04,652
What? That's it? It's over?

908
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:08,573
I'm sorry. I will not go back to prison.

909
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,075
[man] Let's go.

910
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:20,668
Thankfully Seth and Sara didn't
have to witness how quickly you gave up.

911
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:24,005
I told them from the beginning it was
a suicide mission, I wasn't wrong.

912
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:25,840
They trusted you. I trusted you.

913
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:28,843
Join the club of everybody else
in my life who I've disappointed.

914
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,846
They will dissect them
like frogs in biology. You know that.

915
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,806
It's not my problem and it never...

916
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,683
Hey!

917
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,993
By the way, that slap, very realistic.

918
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,996
When did you know?

919
01:12:57,081 --> 01:13:00,041
You haven't bailed on the kids yet.
Why start now?

920
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,961
[indistinct chatter over PA]

921
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,633
How soon until
the subjects are prepped?

922
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,259
They're heavily sedated.

923
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:14,305
Minimal med tests
proceeding within 48 to 72 hours.

924
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,975
Unacceptable. Commence the procedure.

925
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,228
We don't know enough
about their systems.

926
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:23,022
Any sudden change
could terminate the subjects.

927
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,816
You can't just kill them.

928
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:32,031
Mr. Pope. You would do well
not to forget what our mission is.

929
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,075
Our orders come from Washington,

930
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:38,079
and Washington wants answers
to some very complex questions.

931
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,415
Our goal is to provide those answers.

932

Now, if you are doubting your ability...

01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,464
No... sir.

934
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:54,470
Very good, then.
Commence the tests, Mr. Matheson.

Thanks.

01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,723
- Back up. Back up for a second.
- What?

941
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:04,916
It's gonna be OK.
I'm gonna be here the whole time.

942
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,752
I'll be right below you the whole time.

- I can.
- You can.

Oh, no, Jack. Exhaust furnace!

01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:31,859
This way. Come here.
There's another tunnel right here.

[Henry] We're very close to determining

Yes, sir, containment
is at a hundred percent.

And thank you
for sticking by me and the project.

I know it's taken
a long time to get here,

966
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,657
but we both agree
it's been worth our previous failures.

01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:16,099
[grunting, panting]

1091
01:29:31,824 --> 01:29:33,325
Jack!

1092
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,205
You're better with the mask on.

1093
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:50,092
[screaming]

1094
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:10,445
Ah!

1095
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,046
[Seth] Jack!

1096
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:46,022
Yes, he's here.

1097
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:49,109
Sir, it's Washington.
They have some questions for you.

1098
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:57,576
Sir?

1099
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:01,246
[Sara] You both must hurry.

1100
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,248
Only a matter of time
before they get here.

1101
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:05,959
- Don't worry about us.
- Sara and I want you to have this.

1102
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:10,464
As long as it's in your possession,
we'll always be able to find you.

1103
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,013
Thanks.

1104
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:27,522
Your parents will be very proud
of what you've done here.

1105
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:34,404
Thank you, Alex.

1106
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:42,412
I once said that we could never count
on humans to help us. Especially you.

1107
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,999
I was wrong, and for that I am sorry.

1108
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,709
You take care of yourself.

1109
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:52,172
And your sister, too. Do you understand?

1110
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:56,927
- Yes.
- Jack?

1111
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,811
You guys remember that, me and Alex...

1112
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:12,484
...we're only a wormhole away. OK?

1113
01:32:12,568 --> 01:32:15,278
I want you to promise me something.

1114
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,823
Take care of Junkyard for me.

1115
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:22,285
- [barking]
- Anything you want.

1116
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,336
[Seth] It's time.

1117
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,299
[Sara] You're a good man, Jack.

1118
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:54,502
[man] If everything that
you wrote about in your book is true,

1119
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,630
why risk coming out
in the public at all?

1120
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:59,090
Why haven't you been
arrested yet, or worse?

1121
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:02,594
We decided right away that
the more public we went with the story,

1122
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:06,222
then the less likely we were
to... disappear.

1123
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:09,601
And so far, clearly, we've been right.

1124
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:12,854
- Thank you all so much for listening.
- Thank you.

1125
01:34:12,938 --> 01:34:14,439
[cheering]

1126
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:19,819
Technically,
I planned the whole mission.

1127
01:34:22,281 --> 01:34:24,574
[cheering]

1128
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:33,667
A big nebula guy. How's it going?

1129
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:35,377
- Hi, boys.
- Doctor.

1130
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:41,174
- Jack! Jack!
- [crowd shouting]

1131
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:44,010
Howdy, boys. How you doing?

1132
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:45,595
He touched me!

1133
01:34:46,972 --> 01:34:50,100
- [crowd shouting]
- Come back to us, please!

1134
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,233
Good boy.

1135
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,783
- Thank you.
- [beeping]

1136
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:24,843
[engine revving]

1137
01:35:24,927 --> 01:35:27,011
[Jack] Here we go.
