1
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:16,663
<i>breaking a whole unit.</i>
<i>Fire at will.</i>

2
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:17,893
<i>Squad 2, pick your target.</i>

3
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:20,299
<i>There's too many, Captain!</i>
<i>- Watch your stabilizer, Gold 6.</i>

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,304
<i>Anybody, cover me.</i>
<i>I've got two vultures on my tail.</i>

5
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:23,964
<i>- We gotta hold them here.</i>
<i>- Watch your left!</i>

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,066
<i>- I can't shake them! I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>
<i>- Where's our reinforcements?</i>

7
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,631
<i>A galaxy divided!</i>

8
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:55,535
<i>Striking swiftly</i>
<i>after the Battle of Geonosis,</i>

9
00:00:55,605 --> 00:01:00,008
<i>Count Dooku's droid army has seized</i>
<i>control of the major hyperspace lanes,</i>

10
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,873
<i>separating the Republic</i>
<i>from the majority of its clone army.</i>

11
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:05,844
<i>With few clones available,</i>

12
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:08,884
<i>the Jedi generals cannot gain</i>
<i>a foothold in the Outer Rim</i>

13
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,249
<i>as more and more planets choose</i>
<i>to join Dooku's Separatists.</i>

14
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:19,761
<i>While the Jedi are occupied fighting a war,</i>
<i>no one is left to keep the peace.</i>

15
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:21,897
<i>Chaos and crime spread,</i>

16
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:25,694
<i>and the innocent become victims</i>
<i>in a lawless galaxy.</i>

17
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:30,805
<i>Crime lord Jabba the Hutt's son has</i>
<i>been kidnapped by a rival band of pirates.</i>

18
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:35,234
<i>Desperate to save his son,</i>
<i>Jabba puts out a call for help.</i>

19
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:39,570
<i>A call the Jedi are cautious to answer.</i>

20
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,277
<i>Jabba requests that anyone who can</i>
<i>help us find his kidnapped son</i>

21
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:47,455
<i>send any information</i>
<i>they have immediately.</i>

22
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:51,591
We must help Jabba. This is
the opportunity we've been looking for.

23
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:54,161
The Jedi must rescue Jabba's son.

24
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:58,265
I don't like it,
dealing with that criminal scum.

25
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:01,626
This is a dark day for the Republic.

26
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:04,968
I agree, my friend,
but what choice do we have?

27
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,972
The Hutts control the Outer Rim,

28
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:10,738
and we'll need their space lanes
in order to move our troops.

29
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:14,576
There is more to this kidnapping
than it seems.

30
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:17,751
Then you must send
as many Jedi as you can.

31
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,682
Impossible, Chancellor.

32
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,949
The droid General Grievous
has our forces spread thin.

33
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,788
The only Jedi we can spare
are Skywalker and Kenobi.

34
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:29,193
They just captured
the planet Christophsis.

35
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,864
Then contact them immediately.

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,315
<i>We need to make contact</i>
<i>with General Kenobi.</i>

37
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,458
We've been unable to reach him.
It could be a solar storm,

38
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:58,821
or they're rebooting
their communication system.

39
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:01,156
I'm sure the blackout is temporary.

40
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:04,598
<i>A messenger, we are sending,</i>
<i>with important orders for General Kenobi.</i>

41
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:07,636
<i>See to it that she gets there</i>
<i>as fast as possible.</i>

42
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,705
Yes, sir.
As soon as we load relief supplies.

43
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:14,475
<i>No time, there is.</i>
<i>Immediately, the messenger must go.</i>

44
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:19,473
I understand, sir. I will personally take
an unloaded ship to drop her off,

45
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,912
then return to pick up my reinforcements.

46
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,578
Go, go, go, go, go!

47
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:29,481
They're back!

48
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,320
I told you this victory was too easy.

49
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:35,761
We never should have
sent the ship back for supplies.

50
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,490
It wasn't my idea to send the ship back.

51
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:40,659
All right, men. Second wave incoming.

52
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,828
Rex, you and your men follow me.

53
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,836
Cody, battle positions!

54
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:45,966
Up to the front!

55
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:23,207
Incoming!

56
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:33,814
Skywalker should have attacked by now.

57
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:36,218
Don't worry! He knows the plan!

58
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:42,059
What's our plan of attack, sir?

59
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:43,623
Follow me.

60
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,180
Come on, then!

61
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,250
- Right on!
- Give it to them!

62
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,122
That's the stuff!

63
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,461
Come on you traitors!

64
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,256
- Target.
- Careful, lads. There, on the right!

65
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,322
We're gonna need reinforcements.

66
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:21,920
We haven't been able to
get through to the Admiral.

67
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:44,649
- Why are we stopping?
<i>- We cannot get past their cannons, sir.</i>

68
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,153
Cannons? This will never do.

69
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:51,225
We must pull back
and set up our deflector shields.

70
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:53,687
Turn the troops around!

71
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:56,665
Retreat! Retreat!

72
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,927
Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

73
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:00,930
They're pulling back.

74
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,503
Looks like help has arrived.

75
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,746
Our cruiser must be back.

76
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,510
Which means we'll be able
to get our reinforcements.

77
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,746
Then it looks like our problems are solved.
Fresh troops, new supplies,

78
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:23,187
and perhaps they brought
my new Padawan with them.

79
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,556
You really think it's a good idea
to bring a Padawan learner into all this?

80
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:28,458
I spoke to Master Yoda about it.

81
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:32,328
You should put in a request for one.
You'd make a good teacher.

82
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:33,993
No, thanks.

83
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,698
Anakin, teaching is a privilege.

84
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,032
And it's part of a Jedi's responsibility
to help train the next generation.

85
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,542
A Padawan would just slow me down.

86
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,181
A youngling?

87
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,448
And who are you supposed to be?

88
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:59,989
I'm Ahsoka. Master Yoda sent me.

89
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:01,687
I was told to tell both of you

90
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:04,232
that you must get back to
the Jedi Temple immediately.

91
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,325
- There's an emergency.
- Well, I don't know if you've noticed,

92
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,598
but we're in a bit of
an emergency right here.

93
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:12,140
Yes, our communications
have been a bit unreliable,

94
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,800
but we've been calling for help.

95
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:17,742
Master Yoda hadn't heard from you
so he sent me to deliver the message.

96
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,974
Oh, great.
They don't even know we're in trouble.

97
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,176
Maybe you can relay a signal through
the cruiser that just dropped me off.

98
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,930
We need to go back
and pick up our reinforcements.

99
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,093
We've got to get out of here!

100
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,296
We're under attack
by Separatist warships,

101
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:48,102
but I'll try to make contact with
the Jedi Temple for you. Stand by.

102
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,448
<i>Master Kenobi,</i>
<i>glad Ahsoka found you, I am.</i>

103
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:03,750
Master Yoda, we are trapped here,
and vastly outnumbered.

104
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:07,887
We are in no position
to go anywhere or do anything.

105
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:10,699
Our support ships
have all been destroyed.

106
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,834
<i>Send reinforcements to you, we will.</i>

107
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,868
Master Yoda? Master Yoda?

108
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,800
We've lost the transmission, sir.

109
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,140
We have to leave orbit immediately.
More enemy ships have just arrived.

110
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,871
We'll get back to you as soon as we can.

111
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,116
Well, I guess we'll have to hold out
a little longer.

112
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,920
My apologies, young one.
It's time for a proper introduction.

113
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:39,188
I'm the new Padawan learner.
I'm Ahsoka Tano.

114
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,187
I'm Obi-Wan Kenobi, your new master.

115
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,099
I'm at your service, Master Kenobi,

116
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:48,528
but I'm afraid I've actually been assigned
to Master Skywalker.

117
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:51,195
What? No, no, no.

118
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:54,399
There must be some mistake.
He's the one who wanted the Padawan.

119
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,705
No, Master Yoda was very specific.

120
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,976
I'm assigned to Anakin Skywalker,
and he is to supervise my Jedi training.

121
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,417
- But that doesn't make any sense.
- We'll have to sort this out later.

122
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,823
It won't be long before those droids
figure out a way around our cannons.

123
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,359
I'll check on Rex in the lookout post.

124
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,561
You'd better take her with you.

125
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:28,938
I have brought Jabba's son
to the abandoned monastery.

126
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,270
He will be safe here.

127
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:34,773
<i>Good, good.</i>

128
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,917
<i>Everything is going as planned.</i>

129
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,245
Yes, my lord.

130
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:47,055
<i>Soon the Jedi will not only be</i>
<i>at war with you, Count,</i>

131
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,126
<i>but the Hutt clan as well.</i>

132
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,613
What's the status, Rex?

133
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:09,114
Quiet for now, sir.
They're gearing up for another assault.

134
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:10,682
Who's the youngling?

135
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,655
I'm Master Skywalker's Padawan.
The name's Ahsoka Tano.

136
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,988
Sir, I thought you said
you'd never have a Padawan.

137
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,628
There's been a mix-up.
The youngling isn't with me.

138
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,765
Stop calling me that!
You're stuck with me, Skyguy.

139
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:28,535
What did you just call me?
Don't get snippy with me, little one.

140
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,266
You know, I don't even think
you're old enough to be a Padawan.

141
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,671
Well, maybe I'm not,
but Master Yoda thinks I am.

142
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:36,778
Well, you're not with Master Yoda now.

143
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:39,280
So, if you're ready,
you better start proving it.

144
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:43,114
Captain Rex will show you how
a little respect can go a long way.

145
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,783
Right.

146
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,989
- Come on, youngling.
- Padawan.

147
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,985
Have you thought about
moving that line back, Captain?

148
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,824
They'd have better cover that way.

149
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:57,397
Thanks for the suggestion,

150
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,934
but General Skywalker thinks
they're fine where they are.

151
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:04,302
So, if you're a captain and I'm a Jedi,

152
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:07,536
then, technically, I outrank you, right?

153
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:11,313
In my book, experience
outranks everything.

154
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:16,008
Well, if experience outranks everything,
I guess I better start getting some.

155
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:17,683
What's that?

156
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,520
Not good. They've got an energy shield.

157
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:25,853
That's gonna make things
damn near impossible.

158
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:28,189
If you wanted experience, little one,

159
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:31,691
it looks like you're about to get plenty.

160
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,085
What is it?

161
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:56,922
<i>The clones are pulling back,</i>

162
00:12:57,092 --> 00:13:00,186
<i>and the lead tanks are now</i>
<i>approaching the city center.</i>

163
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,490
Get to those heavy cannons
as quickly as you can!

164
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,905
The shield generator is
somewhere in this area.

165
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,073
They're slowly increasing the diameter,
and keeping it just ahead of their troops.

166
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:24,242
Heavy cannons
are gonna be useless against that.

167
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,787
As they get closer, I suppose we could
try to draw them into the buildings.

168
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:30,050
That might level the playing field a bit.

169
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:34,252
If that shield's gonna be such a problem,
why don't we just take it out?

170
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:40,097
- Easier said than done.
- Well, I, for one, agree with her.

171
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:43,502
Someone has to get to that
shield generator and destroy it.

172
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:44,730
That's the key.

173
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,240
Right, then. Maybe you two
can tiptoe through the enemy lines

174
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,435
and solve
this particular problem together.

175
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,480
- Can do, Master Kenobi.
- I'll decide what we do.

176
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:55,807
If Rex and I can engage them here,

177
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:59,751
you two might have a chance to get
through their lines undetected, here.

178
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,914
They won't have much time.
The droids far outnumber us,

179
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,653
so our ability to street fight is limited
without the use of heavy cannons.

180
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:08,854
They will march forward under
the protection of their shield

181
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,628
until they are right on top of our cannons,
then they'll blow them away.

182
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,636
We'll figure out a way.
Come on, Master, let's go.

183
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:19,831
If we survive this, Snips,
you and I are gonna have a talk.

184
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:24,445
They make quite a pair, don't they, sir?
You think they have a chance?

185
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,602
They better.

186
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,615
If they can't turn off that shield generator
before it reaches the heavy cannons,

187
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,776
there'll be no escape for any of us.

188
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,017
What's the status?

189
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:39,988
It looks like those bounty hunters
went up there.

190
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:43,825
Contact General Windu.
Tell him we found the Hutt.

191
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,724
Yes, Commander?

192
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,428
<i>We've discovered that Jabba the Hutt</i>

193
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:50,267
<i>has also hired bounty hunters</i>
<i>to track down his son,</i>

194
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,637
<i>and we followed them to</i>
<i>a monastery on planet Teth.</i>

195
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,770
<i>We feel it's where</i>
<i>Jabba 's son is being held,</i>

196
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,710
<i>but it's too heavily fortified for us</i>
<i>to do anything alone, sir.</i>

197
00:14:57,913 --> 00:15:00,882
Commander, stay out of sight
and await further orders.

198
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,483
<i>Will do, General.</i>

199
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:07,350
Unusual, it is, a problem Obi-Wan
has, subduing the droid army.

200
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:09,081
I'll take care of it.

201
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:12,819
Get me Admiral Wurtz.
I need three of his star cruisers.

202
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,984
<i>Yes, General.</i>

203
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:17,065
Greater than we think,
this mystery may be.

204
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:20,531
Go with the fleet
to aid Master Kenobi, I will.

205
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:25,931
So, what's the plan?

206
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:29,044
I thought
you were the one with the plan.

207
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,375
No, I'm the one with enthusiasm.

208
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:35,540
You're the one with the experience, which
I'm looking forward to learning from.

209
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:40,450
Well, first, we need to get behind
that shield, then get past their tank lines.

210
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,885
Why don't we just go around?
Outflank them?

211
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,185
- That'd take too long.
- Sneak through the middle, then?

212
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,821
Impossible.
Unless you can turn yourself into a droid.

213
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,599
All right. You win.

214
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:56,234
My first lesson will be to wait
while you come up with the answer.

215
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:58,872
Well, the wait's over. I've got a plan.

216
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:20,018
That shield is certainly putting
a crimp in my day.

217
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:23,754
It's no use, sir! Even at full power
the cannon doesn't affect it.

218
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:28,130
All right, Rex. It was worth a try.
Tell the men to fall back!

219
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:48,518
This is a stupid plan!

220
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:52,183
We should fight these guys,
instead of just sneaking around.

221
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:55,421
Except for the fact that their deflective
energy shield just passed over us.

222
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,532
If you can't cross their lines,
let their lines cross you.

223
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,168
If you say so.

224
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:15,477
We're inside the shield.
Just stay away from those tanks.

225
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,685
A Jedi?

226
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,863
- Where's the General?
- I don't know, sir!

227
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:45,677
Fall back!

228
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:55,512
I think we made it past all of them,
Master. We may pull this off yet.

229
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:59,357
We still have a ways to go before
we get to the generator station.

230
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,259
Do we still need this thing?

231
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,524
I can't take it anymore.
I have to stand up.

232
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:08,894
You have got to be careful!

233
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:11,195
You never know
what you're gonna run into.

234
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:16,242
See what I mean?

235
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,078
- We can't beat its shield.
- Run!

236
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:30,089
- What? Jedi don't run!
- I said, run!

237
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,426
- Ahsoka, stop!
- Make up your mind!

238
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:38,589
I said, stop!

239
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:46,731
Good. You take direction well.

240
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:58,913
They're right behind us, sir!
They wiped out most of my unit.

241
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:00,213
We had to pull out of there.

242
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,690
The shield has almost reached
the heavy cannons.

243
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:09,824
We're not gonna be able to stop them, sir.

244
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:11,989
Move your troops back
to the heavy cannons.

245
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:15,261
Do everything you can to protect them.
I'll delay the droids.

246
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:18,133
- But...
- That is an order, Captain!

247
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,589
There it is. Come on.

248
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,096
You must be
the infamous General Kenobi.

249
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,867
I surrender.

250
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:04,144
Now, Master Kenobi,
order your troops to stand down.

251
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:09,250
General, have a seat.

252
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,786
Have you gone mad?

253
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,655
I've conceded the battle.

254
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,855
Now we simply have to
negotiate the terms of surrender.

255
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:20,262
Don't try any of your tricks, Jedi.

256
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:23,734
Surely there's no reason
we can't be civilized about this.

257
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:34,212
'Tis a rare honor to be able to meet
one's opponent face-to-face.

258
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,907
You're a legend
throughout the Inner Core.

259
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:43,923
Thank you. The honor is all mine.
I'm so glad you decided to surrender.

260
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,686
Well, at some point, one must accept
the reality of the situation.

261
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:51,464
Might we have some refreshments?

262
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:55,665
You! Bring us something liquid.

263
00:20:57,272 --> 00:20:59,934
Thank you. This shouldn't take long.

264
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,747
We are approaching Christophsis, sir.

265
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:12,112
The Separatist blockade
is holding position.

266
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:15,779
Deploy the fleet.
Have the cruisers protect the transports.

267
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:17,113
Yes, sir.

268
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,260
Admiral, hurry, we must,
if we are to aid General Kenobi.

269
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,661
It will not be easy to breach the blockade,
Master Yoda.

270
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:28,162
It's what stopped our relief ships before.

271
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:30,965
Last time, not as many ships did you have.

272
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:35,868
Get past it, we must.
Get past it, we will.

273
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:43,110
Stay close. We've gotta be careful.

274
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:44,808
- Come on!
- Wait!

275
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,648
Why? We're almost there. It's right...

276
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:49,017
I said, wait!

277
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,289
Forget about the droids!
Set those charges!

278
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:18,311
Sorry!

279
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,387
Whose side are you on, anyway?

280
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:22,614
Setting the charges.

281
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:37,998
Sir! General Kenobi's been captured!
There's no one else left.

282
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:42,040
We've got to hold out! We can't
let that shield reach the cannons.

283
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,575
Keep fighting!

284
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:45,576
I could use a little help!

285
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:48,215
Skyguy, don't move!

286
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:53,177
What? No, no, no!

287
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:05,154
- You could have gotten me killed!
- I know what I'm doing.

288
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:10,535
- I had everything under control.
- I just saved your life.

289
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:18,376
There's too many of them!
- Fall back, fall back!

290
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:21,338
Man down!

291
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:24,374
Medic! We need a medic here!

292
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:40,565
And, of course, once you've
taken custody of my troops,

293
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:43,067
arrangements will need to be made
for their food and shelter.

294
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:47,902
- Tell me, do you have enough supplies...
- Enough of this! You are stalling!

295
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:51,910
Nonsense. General, there are
numerous details to be discussed.

296
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:56,373
Seize him!

297
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,616
Unless you call off your troops right now,
I will have no choice but to destroy you.

298
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:08,426
Truthfully, I was hoping your shield
would be knocked out by now.

299
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:10,997
- Did you get the charges set?
- Yes.

300
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,794
Then what are you waiting for?

301
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:19,870
Uh-oh.

302
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:24,968
Oh, well.

303
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:33,746
Don't fire!

304
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:38,081
Something appears
to have happened to your shield, General.

305
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,724
All cannons, fire on those tanks!

306
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:45,026
What happened to the shield?

307
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:54,670
<i>General Kenobi, if you can hear me,</i>
<i>we're through the blockade.</i>

308
00:24:54,843 --> 00:24:57,004
<i>The Separatist armada is in retreat.</i>

309
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,510
<i>Your reinforcements</i>
<i>should be landing in a moment.</i>

310
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,060
Your timing is perfect, Master Yoda.

311
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:25,606
You're reckless, little one.

312
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:28,006
You never would have made it
as Obi-Wan's Padawan.

313
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,343
But you might make it as mine.

314
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:43,849
Come on.

315
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,862
Great job, General Skywalker.

316
00:25:55,403 --> 00:25:56,495
You, too, kid.

317
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:16,323
- Thanks for the ride, Rex.
- Anytime, sir.

318
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:17,783
Master Obi-Wan.

319
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,318
Master Yoda.

320
00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:23,391
Trouble, you have,
with your new Padawan, I hear.

321
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:29,433
I was explaining
the situation to Master Yoda.

322
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,562
Really?

323
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:34,598
If not ready for a Padawan, you are,
then perhaps, Obi-Wan, we can...

324
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:39,272
No, wait a minute. I admit Ahsoka
is a little rough around the edges.

325
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:43,147
But with a great deal of training,
and patience,

326
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:45,146
she might amount to something.

327
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:49,251
Then go with you, she will,
to the Teth system.

328
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:53,226
Teth? That's Wild Space.
The droid army isn't even in that sector.

329
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:56,423
Kidnapped, Jabba the Hutt's son has been.

330
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:59,294
You want me to rescue Jabba's son?

331
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:03,597
Anakin, we'll need the Hutts' allegiance
to give us an advantage over Dooku.

332
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:07,765
Negotiate the treaty with Jabba,
Obi-Wan will.

333
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:12,807
Find the renegades that hold Jabba's son,
your mission will be, Skywalker.

334
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:15,814
Come on, Master,
it doesn't sound that hard.

335
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,215
I'll find Rex and get the troops organized.

336
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:19,613
Don't worry, Anakin.

337
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:23,747
Just teach her everything I taught you
and she'll turn out fine.

338
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:28,756
You know, something makes me think
this was your idea from the start.

339
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:33,461
Let's just hope Anakin
is ready for this responsibility.

340
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,297
Ready, he is, to teach an apprentice.

341
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:41,041
To let go of his pupil,
a greater challenge it will be.

342
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:44,368
Master this, Skywalker must.

343
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,041
If I've got to make a deal
with Jabba the Hutt,

344
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:53,284
I'd best be on my way.

345
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:29,319
Jabba, the bounty hunters you sent out
to find your son have returned.

346
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:56,877
Contact the Supreme Chancellor
immediately.

347
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:07,083
<i>The all-powerful Jabba demands to know</i>
<i>why the Jedi are not looking for his son.</i>

348
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:12,063
Mighty Jabba, rest assured,
the Jedi are on their way.

349
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,907
<i>They better be if you want the Republic</i>

350
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:25,569
<i>to have safe passage</i>
<i>through Jabba 's territory.</i>

351
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:04,744
Lieutenant, did the kidnappers see you?

352
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,786
No, sir.
We're the best scouts in the regiment.

353
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:10,288
What about the bounty hunters?
Are they still down there?

354
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:13,325
I don't think so.
We haven't seen them in a while.

355
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:15,429
Well, what are we up against?

356
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:18,926
Looks like at least two droid battalions
protecting a monastery.

357
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,762
It's heavily fortified, sir,
you won't be able to land there.

358
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,598
Good work. Get some rest.

359
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:33,545
That sounds like a lot, even for a Jedi.

360
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:36,809
I heard you were surrounded by droids.
How did you ever get the shield down?

361
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,984
Okay, so there's a wall behind him
with a hole in the middle,

362
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:44,457
so I pull the wall down on top of
the droids, destroying them

363
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,323
and saving the General.

364
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:51,261
- Is that true, sir?
- Well, most of it.

365
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,095
All right, men, we still got a job to do.

366
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:58,332
- Yes, sir. You heard the General, move it!
- All right, back to business.

367
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,675
Would this be a good time to teach you
that a Jedi is humble, my young Padawan?

368
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:07,337
Sorry, just trying to keep
the boys inspired, is all.

369
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:21,457
Don't worry,
I'm sure Jabba's in a good mood.

370
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:58,021
We should not keep the wise
and powerful Jabba waiting.

371
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:00,223
I wouldn't dream of it.

372
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:26,249
Mighty Jabba, one of our most powerful
Jedi is on his way to rescue your son.

373
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:28,160
We will not let you down.

374
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:37,434
The most gracious Jabba
has one more small condition.

375
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:42,440
He demands you bring back the slime
who kidnapped his little punky muffin.

376
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,970
"Punky"?

377
00:32:47,782 --> 00:32:49,943
Dead or alive.

378
00:32:57,091 --> 00:33:01,425
If you do not succeed,
Count Dooku and his droid army will.

379
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:13,133
<i>All right, Anakin, here's the story.</i>

380
00:33:13,307 --> 00:33:15,605
<i>Jabba has given us</i>
<i>only one planetary rotation</i>

381
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:19,144
<i>to get his son back home</i>
<i>to Tatooine safe and sound.</i>

382
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:20,510
Won't take us that long, Master.

383
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:24,812
<i>Well, take extreme care. We have no idea</i>
<i>who's holding Jabba 's son.</i>

384
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:27,750
<i>When I've finished negotiations with him,</i>
<i>I will join you.</i>

385
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:39,156
There's something coming.
I can't make out what it is.

386
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,301
I don't like it. Prepare to attack.

387
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:42,834
What if it's one of ours?

388
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:45,734
- Shut up, Sergeant. I'm in command here!
- Roger, roger.

389
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:53,344
- Stay close to me, if you can.
- It won't be a problem, Master.

390
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:58,349
- This isn't practice, Ahsoka.
- I know, and I'll try not to get you killed.

391
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,857
Good shot, boy!

392
00:34:07,061 --> 00:34:08,722
Sir! We're taking heavy fire!

393
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:11,888
Close the blast shields, Lieutenant!
Get us under those guns!

394
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:13,055
Yes, sir.

395
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:15,858
Here we go.

396
00:34:17,238 --> 00:34:19,706
- Ridge, your com's gone static.
- Got it.

397
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,937
Red light. Stand by.

398
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:29,049
Welcome to paradise, rockjumpers.

399
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,108
Green light!

400
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,581
Go, go, go!

401
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,788
Move it! Move it!

402
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:42,124
Watch it! Watch it!

403
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,390
Hurry!

404
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,358
Go, go, go!

405
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:51,103
Concentrate fire on Sector 11374265!

406
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:54,897
1137... What was that again?

407
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:56,304
Just fire right there!

408
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:04,643
Follow me!

409
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,056
I can't see them.

410
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:14,319
Where'd they go?

411
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:21,291
Oh, my God!

412
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:22,902
Get back here, Sergeant.

413
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,039
- So, this is where the fun begins.
- Race you to the top.

414
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:28,268
- I'll give you a head start.
- Your mistake.

415
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:29,966
Ascension cables!

416
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:32,475
I'm right behind you, Master!

417
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:55,627
Target those walkers!

418
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:15,071
Gotta keep up!

419
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:17,006
Hey! No fair!

420
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:24,215
Rex, follow me!

421
00:37:24,892 --> 00:37:26,587
Yes, sir! Working on it.

422
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,424
Get this thing moving!

423
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:39,539
Surrender, Jedi!

424
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:53,144
Blast it, Ahsoka,
I told you to stay close to me.

425
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:00,082
I can't get much closer, Skyguy.

426
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:02,923
I knew you'd get here, Snips, eventually.

427
00:38:03,097 --> 00:38:04,792
Always in time to save your life.

428
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:07,160
- All clear, General.
- Nice work, Rex.

429
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:09,162
Have some men look after the wounded.

430
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:12,930
Roger that, sir.
Gunships are holding at a safe distance.

431
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:20,338
The droids have done their part.
Now it's your turn.

432
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:23,440
Too many droids here
for them to be renegades.

433
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:27,317
I sense Count Dooku's hand in this.
Let's find Jabba's son and get outta here.

434
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:31,256
- No problem. The hard part's over.
- I wish you wouldn't say that.

435
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,614
I don't like this place.
It gives me the creeps.

436
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:59,810
This looks like one of those
B'omarr monk monasteries

437
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:02,816
that I read about
in my studies at the Temple.

438
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,722
Smugglers take these monasteries over,

439
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:08,723
turn them into
their own personal retreats.

440
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,958
And the monks just let them?

441
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:14,100
Smugglers usually get what they want
one way or another.

442
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:19,394
- Good guy or bad guy, Master?
- Who are you?

443
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:24,274
Merely the humble caretaker,
O mighty sir.

444
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:27,276
You have liberated me
from those dreadful battle bots.

445
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,847
I am most thankful.

446
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,344
Where is the Hutt?

447
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:33,453
The battle bots kept their prisoners
on the detention level.

448
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,580
I must warn you it is very dangerous
down there, my friend.

449
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,623
Not a place for a servant girl.

450
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,787
Do servant girls carry these?
I am a Jedi Knight

451
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,994
or soon will be.

452
00:39:47,368 --> 00:39:50,337
A thousand apologies, young one.

453
00:39:50,504 --> 00:39:53,496
Captain, we'll get the Hutt.
Stay here and keep your eyes open.

454
00:39:53,674 --> 00:39:55,141
Copy that, sir.

455
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:07,184
They have taken the monastery, Master.

456
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:11,484
Skywalker is here.
He's on his way to rescue the Hutt.

457
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,857
<i>Well, done, Ventress.</i>
<i>All is going according to plan.</i>

458
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,964
I could easily take them now.

459
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:20,124
<i>Patience. Collect the data I need.</i>

460
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:23,728
<i>You will get your chance</i>
<i>at revenge soon enough.</i>

461
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:27,032
Mistress, the Jedi
have entered the dungeons.

462
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:31,503
Master, you know
you're walking us into a trap?

463
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,240
I know.

464
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:39,815
- We just passed two more droids.
- I know.

465
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:42,879
Well, I don't like this.
Can I just take care of them?

466
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:46,122
Oh, well, if you feel so strongly
about it, go ahead.

467
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:58,002
Not bad. You remembered to
destroy their weapons first.

468
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,003
I'm improving your technique.

469
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:05,805
- Of course, you did miss one.
- I did that on purpose.

470
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:11,006
- I sense our kidnapped Hutt is in here.
- I smell him, too.

471
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:17,822
He's a lot younger than I thought he'd be.

472
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:20,517
Oh, he's just a baby.

473
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:25,258
This will make our job a lot easier.
Oh, he's so cute.

474
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,500
Just wait until you see
what he'll grow into.

475
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:41,508
I know, R4. I want to get out of here, too.

476
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:04,863
O great Jabba the Hutt,
I have news of your son.

477
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:08,869
I have discovered it is the Jedi
who have kidnapped him.

478
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,611
How have you come by this information?

479
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:22,449
I have my ways. More importantly,
mighty Jabba, I bring a warning.

480
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:25,081
The Jedi are planning to destroy you.

481
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,558
The most wise Jabba demands proof.

482
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:34,724
And he shall have it.

483
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:40,934
- No sign of any more droids, Captain.
- All right, Sergeant.

484
00:42:41,108 --> 00:42:45,101
General Skywalker, the castle is secure,
and it's nearly midday.

485
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:49,010
Thanks, Rex. We've got Jabba's son.
Any sign of General Kenobi yet?

486
00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:50,172
<i>No, sir.</i>

487
00:42:50,284 --> 00:42:55,187
Master, my Jedi training didn't prepare me
for this. What are we gonna do?

488
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:59,686
Well, since you think that smelly larva
is cute, you're gonna carry it.

489
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:17,736
Commander, tell Admiral Yularen
to get underway.

490
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:20,641
- We need to reinforce Anakin.
- Right away, sir.

491
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:23,806
How do you like your little buddy now?
Still cute?

492
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:27,147
You know, he's reminding me
of you more and more.

493
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,953
See? You're two of a kind.

494
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:33,491
Maybe you should carry both of us then.

495
00:43:38,832 --> 00:43:42,393
Master, I think this little guy is sick.
He's burning up with a fever.

496
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:47,463
You're right. We've got to get him back
to the ship immediately.

497
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,099
Trooper! Get me a backpack!

498
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:55,713
<i>Will you just let me do it?</i>

499
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:58,179
<i>I hate Hutts.</i>

500
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:04,215
My lord,
I have the recording you requested.

501
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:08,858
<i>Transmit it at once. Your new objective</i>
<i>is to recover the Hutt.</i>

502
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:11,892
And deliver him to Jabba unharmed?

503
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,429
<i>Precisely. Do not fail me.</i>

504
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:21,903
<i>Will you just let me do it?</i>

505
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,510
<i>I hate Hutts.</i>

506
00:44:30,284 --> 00:44:35,517
As you can see, it is the Jedi who have
your son and are plotting against you.

507
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,589
My droid army
has already initiated a rescue.

508
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:47,029
Rest assured, mighty Jabba,
your son will be saved.

509
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:59,501
Mighty Jabba wishes to know
what you ask in return.

510
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:04,483
Perhaps you would consider joining
our struggle against the Republic.

511
00:45:06,587 --> 00:45:08,452
<i>Anakin,</i>
<i>did you locate Jabba 's son?</i>

512
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:12,115
We have him, but it looks like
the Separatists are behind his abduction.

513
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,590
This smells like Count Dooku to me.

514
00:45:14,762 --> 00:45:17,162
I think it's little Stinky you smell.

515
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:20,997
<i>I'll bet Dooku is using us</i>
<i>to get Jabba to join the Separatists.</i>

516
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:25,605
Master Kenobi, we have another problem.
This Huttlet is very sick.

517
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:28,071
I'm not sure we can get him back
to Tatooine alive, Master.

518
00:45:28,242 --> 00:45:30,233
This whole rescue may backfire on us.

519
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:32,538
I still don't think dealing
with the Hutts is a good idea.

520
00:45:32,613 --> 00:45:35,844
<i>Anakin, you know they control</i>
<i>shipping routes in the Outer Rim.</i>

521
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,441
<i>Jabba 's cooperation is crucial</i>
<i>to the war effort.</i>

522
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:40,648
<i>If you let anything happen to his son,</i>

523
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:42,848
<i>our chances of a treaty</i>
<i>with him will disappear.</i>

524
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:46,157
Master? We've got trouble!

525
00:45:49,596 --> 00:45:51,086
Defensive positions!

526
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:53,491
<i>- Anakin?</i>
- I'll have to call you back, Master.

527
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:56,502
We're under attack. We could use
a little help here if you have the time.

528
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,232
<i>I'll get there as soon as I can.</i>
<i>Protect the Hutt, Anakin.</i>

529
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:11,513
We've got spiders inbound!

530
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,660
Get inside!

531
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,006
Fall back!

532
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:46,342
Fall back! Fall back!

533
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,387
Mistress, the Jedi have barricaded
themselves inside the main vault.

534
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,033
They have nowhere to run.

535
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:05,365
Captain, we'll stay here until General
Kenobi arrives with reinforcements.

536
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,473
- What?
- Master,

537
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:10,942
do you honestly think
we can hold them off?

538
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:12,672
We've got to find a way out of here.

539
00:47:12,846 --> 00:47:14,677
Our mandate is to protect this Hutt,

540
00:47:14,848 --> 00:47:16,782
and that's what
we're going to do, Ahsoka.

541
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,580
Our mandate was to get this Hutt
back to Tatooine,

542
00:47:19,653 --> 00:47:23,111
- and time is running out.
- I suppose you have a plan.

543
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:28,859
Yes, or I think so, R2 willing.

544
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:32,023
All right, Snips. I'll trust you on this one.

545
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:34,027
Captain, hold them here
as long as you can.

546
00:47:34,201 --> 00:47:36,169
Will do, sir. You heard the General!

547
00:47:36,336 --> 00:47:39,533
Get ready to turn those clankers
into scrap metal!

548
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:46,073
If there's a way out of here,
Artooie will find it.

549
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:50,349
Make it quick.

550
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:55,548
Finally asleep, huh? Put him down.
Get some rest yourself.

551
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,317
It's been a long day for you, little one.

552
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:59,689
I can hold him, Master. I'm not tired.

553
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,455
Okay, suit yourself. I don't see why
you won't just listen to me.

554
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,689
I do listen to you, Master.

555
00:48:05,866 --> 00:48:08,027
I just don't like
being treated like a youngling.

556
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:11,432
You must have patience.
What are you trying to prove anyway?

557
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,868
That I'm not too young
to be your Padawan.

558
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:18,410
Ahsoka, a very wise Jedi once said,
"Nothing happens by accident."

559
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:21,139
It is the will of the Force
that you are at my side.

560
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,442
I just want to keep you there in one piece.

561
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:33,986
- The red one?
- No.

562
00:48:34,155 --> 00:48:37,249
- The blue one?
- No, not that one.

563
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:41,586
That'll work.

564
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:44,791
They've cut the lock!

565
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:49,429
Here they come!

566
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:55,701
Hold the line!

567
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:00,971
Second wave! Second wave!

568
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:04,177
Watch your left!

569
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,212
That sounded bad.

570
00:49:10,692 --> 00:49:12,057
A backdoor landing platform!

571
00:49:12,227 --> 00:49:15,958
We'll call for a gunship when we get there.
Lead the way, R2.

572
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:19,162
Ahsoka, wait. Where's Stinky?

573
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:21,859
- You told me to put him down!
- Find him!

574
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:27,202
Come outta there, you grubby little slug.

575
00:49:29,477 --> 00:49:31,911
Take care of what's left of the clones.

576
00:49:32,313 --> 00:49:34,213
I'll go after Skywalker.

577
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:35,638
Roger, roger.

578
00:49:35,817 --> 00:49:40,481
Seal the main gate and all portals.
Let nothing escape this castle.

579
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:42,717
Yes, Mistress.

580
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:53,924
Where is Skywalker?

581
00:49:54,102 --> 00:49:56,434
I don't talk to Separatist scum.

582
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:03,435
You will contact Skywalker now.

583
00:50:03,511 --> 00:50:05,945
I will contact Skywalker now.

584
00:50:08,883 --> 00:50:10,714
Let's see you get away this time.

585
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:13,080
<i>- Anakin, come in.</i>
- "Anakin"?

586
00:50:13,254 --> 00:50:16,280
<i>- We've held the droids, sir.</i>
- That's not like Rex.

587
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:19,018
<i>- What is your location?</i>
- Ventress.

588
00:50:19,194 --> 00:50:20,354
Dooku's assassin?

589
00:50:20,528 --> 00:50:22,462
She's here to kill the Hutt. Come on.

590
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:26,230
Mistress, I must inform you that
Republic reinforcements have arrived.

591
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:28,801
- We must hurry.
- Roger, roger.

592
00:50:38,279 --> 00:50:41,077
Skywalker is in trouble.
You know the drill.

593
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:42,409
Copy that, sir.

594
00:50:47,088 --> 00:50:49,249
<i>The Jedi warships have arrived.</i>

595
00:50:49,424 --> 00:50:53,986
<i>You must hold them off until I finish</i>
<i>my mission. Do you understand?</i>

596
00:50:54,162 --> 00:50:58,792
Yes, sir. I mean, ma'am, sir.
Launch all fighters!

597
00:51:14,115 --> 00:51:16,447
Skywalker to Obi-Wan.
Mark my position.

598
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:18,313
I need a medical ship immediately.

599
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:21,313
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- Anakin, do you read me?

600
00:51:21,389 --> 00:51:22,413
<i>Anakin.</i>

601
00:51:23,758 --> 00:51:24,816
Come in!

602
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,128
They're jamming our transmissions.

603
00:51:27,295 --> 00:51:30,025
I hope Anakin is having an easier time
than we are.

604
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:33,463
I can't get ahold of Obi-Wan.
I'll see if I can find Captain Rex.

605
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,861
<i>Come in, Rex. Do you copy?</i>

606
00:51:36,504 --> 00:51:37,493
<i>Rex?</i>

607
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:40,331
- Did you hear that?
- It came from the prisoners.

608
00:51:40,508 --> 00:51:42,806
Let me show you
how it works, clanker.

609
00:51:42,977 --> 00:51:44,001
<i>Do you copy?</i>

610
00:51:57,058 --> 00:51:58,889
Captain Rex, respond.

611
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:02,223
I read you, General.
We're pinned down in the courtyard.

612
00:52:02,397 --> 00:52:03,728
Do you need help?

613
00:52:04,966 --> 00:52:08,561
I'll take that as a yes, Captain. Stand by,
we're on our way. Skywalker, out.

614
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:12,005
Master, Stinky is really sick.

615
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:15,665
He's turning every shade of green
except the one he's supposed to be!

616
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:18,972
Our mission was to
get him back to Tatooine alive.

617
00:52:19,047 --> 00:52:20,571
Obi-Wan will get here eventually.

618
00:52:20,782 --> 00:52:23,580
Right now, we need Rex
to help us find a ship.

619
00:52:24,152 --> 00:52:26,086
Great. Rolling death balls.

620
00:52:28,823 --> 00:52:29,881
R2, the door!

621
00:52:43,271 --> 00:52:47,571
- I think now's a good time for a retreat.
- "Retreat"? That's a new word for you.

622
00:52:47,742 --> 00:52:49,107
Maybe into the jungle.

623
00:52:50,278 --> 00:52:53,247
Wait, I remember the jungle
was a bad place.

624
00:52:57,685 --> 00:52:59,710
So much for going that way.

625
00:53:04,692 --> 00:53:07,855
We can't hold out much longer, sir!
Where's General Skywalker?

626
00:53:08,029 --> 00:53:09,519
He'll be here.

627
00:53:14,535 --> 00:53:16,526
Looks like we're out of options.

628
00:53:19,607 --> 00:53:20,938
No, not now, Stinky.

629
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:26,142
Master! Another landing platform!

630
00:53:26,314 --> 00:53:28,680
- With a ship on it.
- Nice work, Stinky.

631
00:53:33,888 --> 00:53:37,255
- So, how are we gonna get over there?
- Leave that to me.

632
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:45,926
I hope I don't have to learn that.

633
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,778
Where is Skywalker?

634
00:54:03,518 --> 00:54:05,076
Right here, Ventress!

635
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:09,783
Time to go.

636
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,268
- Hop on, Snips.
- Like I have a choice!

637
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:38,817
Count Dooku demands a report
on your mission.

638
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,645
Should I tell him they got away or what?

639
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:44,950
Why?

640
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,925
I'm hit! I can't shake them!

641
00:54:54,335 --> 00:54:56,895
Just relax, Odd Ball. I'm right behind you.

642
00:55:07,548 --> 00:55:09,778
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I panicked.

643
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:12,613
<i>That's all right, Odd Ball.</i>
<i>It happens to everybody.</i>

644
00:55:14,756 --> 00:55:17,884
It looks like there's some kind of battle
on the east side of the palace.

645
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:19,083
I see it, sir.

646
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,559
And if there's a battle,
Anakin's probably in the middle of it.

647
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:25,358
We'll start looking for him there.
All ships, follow me.

648
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,369
We're taking this junker?

649
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:36,772
We'd be better off on that big bug.

650
00:55:36,944 --> 00:55:40,402
Get aboard and prime the engines.
Assuming it has engines.

651
00:55:43,584 --> 00:55:47,384
Hey! You're that caretaker droid.
I wondered what happened to you.

652
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:52,049
Oh, young one.
I mean, soon to be Jedi Knight.

653
00:55:52,226 --> 00:55:54,285
I had to get away from that terrible...

654
00:55:54,462 --> 00:55:58,831
Okay, everything's loaded.
Let's get out of here.

655
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,400
Why, you tin-plated traitor!

656
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:03,436
Blast her!

657
00:56:06,808 --> 00:56:08,969
She's at it again. Let's go.

658
00:56:13,448 --> 00:56:14,779
Don't you dare!

659
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:18,610
Don't... you... dare.

660
00:56:23,858 --> 00:56:25,621
Commander Cody, prepare the gunships
for ground assault.

661
00:56:25,793 --> 00:56:26,782
Yes, sir.

662
00:56:26,961 --> 00:56:28,428
Go, go, go!

663
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:44,506
This is it! Scrap them!

664
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:05,055
Take over, R4.

665
00:57:07,869 --> 00:57:11,396
- Surrender, Republic dogs!
- We've got you outnumbered!

666
00:57:11,472 --> 00:57:14,771
Outnumbered? Wait. One, two, three...

667
00:57:43,771 --> 00:57:47,172
- Where's Skywalker?
- Best guess is he's still in the castle, sir.

668
00:57:47,341 --> 00:57:49,866
Keep the droids occupied. I'll go find him!

669
00:58:01,088 --> 00:58:03,852
Have you recovered Jabba's son?

670
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:08,128
<i>Skywalker is still in possession of the Hutt</i>
<i>and has temporarily eluded me,</i>

671
00:58:08,296 --> 00:58:11,129
<i>but he will not escape the system alive.</i>

672
00:58:11,299 --> 00:58:14,268
Need I remind you
whoever gains Jabba's favor

673
00:58:14,368 --> 00:58:16,461
will control the war in the Outer Rim?

674
00:58:16,904 --> 00:58:21,739
Only we must be allowed
to return Jabba's son to him alive.

675
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:25,177
<i>I understand, Master.</i>
<i>I will double my efforts.</i>

676
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:27,940
I hope so, for your sake.

677
00:58:28,282 --> 00:58:29,340
<i>Wait!</i>

678
00:58:31,819 --> 00:58:33,411
Master Kenobi.

679
00:58:33,621 --> 00:58:38,024
Always chasing after Skywalker.
How predictable.

680
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:43,296
Anakin leaves quite a mess.
Which always leads me to you, Ventress.

681
00:58:43,464 --> 00:58:44,795
Take him.

682
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,004
Now let's get Stinky out of here.

683
00:59:01,782 --> 00:59:03,147
If we can.

684
00:59:13,494 --> 00:59:17,362
Relax, Snips. R2, see if you can
spark the ignition couplers.

685
00:59:24,972 --> 00:59:28,066
No, that's not it.
Try opening the fuel lifters all the way.

686
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,377
Good work, buddy.

687
00:59:47,695 --> 00:59:50,994
Master Kenobi is here.
Now we'll see some real fireworks.

688
00:59:51,165 --> 00:59:53,929
Excuse me? What do you call
what I've been doing all day?

689
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:56,661
I don't know.
The word "reckless" comes to mind.

690
00:59:56,837 --> 01:00:00,034
Very funny, Snips. Back to work.
The troops still need our help.

691
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:01,265
Charge the main guns.

692
01:00:01,442 --> 01:00:04,605
How are we gonna help?
Stinky's getting sicker and sicker.

693
01:00:04,779 --> 01:00:06,246
But we promised Rex we'd help them.

694
01:00:08,683 --> 01:00:11,880
Master, we've got to get him to
the medics on the Jedi cruiser.

695
01:00:12,086 --> 01:00:16,045
It's our only chance to get Stinky
back to his father still breathing.

696
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:23,797
Captain Rex, this is General Skywalker.

697
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:25,395
<i>Yes, General.</i>

698
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,259
We're not going to be able help you.

699
01:00:28,436 --> 01:00:31,530
Don't worry about us, General.
We'll be all right.

700
01:00:33,908 --> 01:00:35,603
The mission always comes first, sir.

701
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:41,441
Cover me!

702
01:00:51,592 --> 01:00:53,617
Ventress, I know you're here.

703
01:00:53,794 --> 01:00:56,729
You can't hide. I feel your frustration.

704
01:00:56,897 --> 01:01:00,628
Let me guess,
you're after Jabba's young son, too.

705
01:01:13,247 --> 01:01:16,307
You'll have to do
better than that, my darling.

706
01:01:23,924 --> 01:01:26,415
Well, now I'm impressed.

707
01:01:30,498 --> 01:01:32,591
Now you die.

708
01:01:42,943 --> 01:01:45,605
- Shall we continue?
- My pleasure.

709
01:01:51,685 --> 01:01:55,553
Master, today I did my best
to stay calm, focused,

710
01:01:55,723 --> 01:01:58,783
and when I did,
everything seemed so easy.

711
01:02:01,962 --> 01:02:05,227
Well, get focused,
'cause things just got a lot harder.

712
01:02:20,014 --> 01:02:22,505
All we've got to do
is land on that Jedi cruiser.

713
01:02:27,321 --> 01:02:29,881
But, Master,
their deflector shields are up!

714
01:02:35,763 --> 01:02:38,698
They must think this grease bucket
is an enemy ship.

715
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:41,426
- Jedi cruiser, hold your fire!
<i>- Who is that?</i>

716
01:02:41,602 --> 01:02:43,866
Incoming ship, identify yourself.

717
01:02:44,038 --> 01:02:46,268
Captain, what's going on down there?

718
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,431
<i>Repeat, identify yourself.</i>

719
01:02:48,609 --> 01:02:51,203
This is General Skywalker.
We have Jabba the Hutt's son.

720
01:02:51,378 --> 01:02:54,006
He needs medical attention.
We must board immediately.

721
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:56,911
<i>- Stand by.</i>
- Stand by? That's helpful.

722
01:03:14,068 --> 01:03:15,126
Hang on!

723
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:29,577
<i>Open the main hangar door</i>
<i>and lower the deflector shields.</i>

724
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,342
You got it, sir.

725
01:03:34,221 --> 01:03:37,588
<i>General Skywalker, we think we can</i>
<i>lift the shields on the lower rear hangar.</i>

726
01:03:37,758 --> 01:03:38,782
We're on our way!

727
01:03:42,129 --> 01:03:43,994
We've made it! We've made it!

728
01:03:49,637 --> 01:03:52,333
General Skywalker, abort! Abort!

729
01:03:54,475 --> 01:03:55,942
That changes our plans.

730
01:03:59,013 --> 01:04:02,449
Looks like we're gonna have to take this
bucket of bolts all the way to Tatooine.

731
01:04:30,644 --> 01:04:34,774
We know of Dooku's plot to turn
the Hutts against us. It will not succeed.

732
01:04:35,482 --> 01:04:38,144
It will when the truth dies with you.

733
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:54,332
You can't run.

734
01:04:57,671 --> 01:04:59,502
We're clear
to make the jump to hyperspace.

735
01:04:59,573 --> 01:05:01,234
R2, program the navicomputer.

736
01:05:04,178 --> 01:05:05,975
I don't think he's gonna make it, Master.

737
01:05:06,146 --> 01:05:08,171
There's gotta be
something we can do for him.

738
01:05:08,349 --> 01:05:11,284
Take a look in the back.
See if you can find some medical supplies.

739
01:05:11,352 --> 01:05:12,410
I'm on it.

740
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:18,820
Don't die on me now, little guy.
Just hang in there.

741
01:05:18,993 --> 01:05:21,723
If you've locked the coordinates,
R2, let's go.

742
01:05:29,503 --> 01:05:34,167
I sense it, too. Anakin is gone.
You've failed, Ventress.

743
01:05:45,919 --> 01:05:48,114
Your master will not be pleased.

744
01:05:53,761 --> 01:05:55,729
Jedi scum!

745
01:05:59,933 --> 01:06:03,391
The Hutt is safe.
There's no point to fighting any longer.

746
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:06,633
We've won. Lay down your weapon.

747
01:06:19,353 --> 01:06:21,947
Looks like this hasn't been used in a while.

748
01:06:23,924 --> 01:06:26,449
Hey, Dr. Droid, can you hear me?

749
01:06:26,627 --> 01:06:29,619
<i>Yes. What seems to be the problem?</i>

750
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:33,766
Great. I've got a sick Huttlet.
You got a remedy?

751
01:06:34,334 --> 01:06:37,269
<i>Oh, yes. I see.</i>

752
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:41,567
<i>You must dispense one of these</i>
<i>medical boosters into the infant's mouth.</i>

753
01:06:42,276 --> 01:06:46,838
<i>If you have any problems,</i>
<i>please call an actual doctor to assist you.</i>

754
01:06:47,815 --> 01:06:49,510
I hope this works.

755
01:06:49,683 --> 01:06:53,619
Okay, sweetums.
I've got some yum-yum for you.

756
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,417
You'll take this and like it!

757
01:07:01,628 --> 01:07:04,358
There you go. Good boy.

758
01:07:10,938 --> 01:07:13,805
Captain, I understand
General Skywalker escaped.

759
01:07:13,974 --> 01:07:16,807
Yes, sir.
On some beat-up old space freighter.

760
01:07:16,977 --> 01:07:19,707
I'll be surprised if he even makes it
to Tatooine in that junker.

761
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,317
If anybody can fly a bucket of bolts
through hyperspace, he can.

762
01:07:29,456 --> 01:07:31,424
The medicine, it's working!

763
01:07:32,192 --> 01:07:35,650
His fever broke. I think
he's gonna live to stink another day.

764
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:39,230
Great. Keeping him alive wasn't as easy
as you'd hoped, was it?

765
01:07:39,399 --> 01:07:41,697
Master, if you have taught me one thing,

766
01:07:41,769 --> 01:07:43,896
it's that nothing is easy
when you are around.

767
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:46,803
You think Rex and Master Obi-Wan
made it out okay?

768
01:07:46,974 --> 01:07:51,877
If I know my old master, he has things
well in hand. Now help me with this.

769
01:07:52,045 --> 01:07:55,674
I want the primary systems fully repaired
by the time we reach Tatooine.

770
01:07:56,683 --> 01:08:01,382
You grew up on Tatooine, right?
So, for you, this trip is like going home.

771
01:08:01,555 --> 01:08:03,022
Yeah.

772
01:08:03,524 --> 01:08:04,650
Home.

773
01:08:09,897 --> 01:08:12,832
<i>The Republic had too many</i>
<i>clone troopers, my lord.</i>

774
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,266
<i>By the time we were able to find</i>
<i>Jabba 's son, Skywalker had already</i>

775
01:08:17,905 --> 01:08:19,167
<i>killed him.</i>

776
01:08:24,077 --> 01:08:28,707
Most unfortunate.
This is a very unexpected turn of events.

777
01:08:29,049 --> 01:08:31,677
I take it you at least defeated the Jedi?

778
01:08:32,052 --> 01:08:36,546
<i>No, Master. The Jedi escaped</i>
<i>and are headed to Tatooine.</i>

779
01:08:36,723 --> 01:08:41,558
I'm sure you did the best you could.
We will discuss your failure later.

780
01:08:42,029 --> 01:08:44,224
<i>Yes, my master.</i>

781
01:08:48,735 --> 01:08:53,729
Glorious Jabba demands to know why
the Jedi would dare come to Tatooine.

782
01:08:54,107 --> 01:08:58,908
To kill you, Jabba.
The Jedi plot is quite clear now.

783
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:02,881
They only promised to rescue your son
to win your trust.

784
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:07,084
Now Skywalker is coming here
to finish his true mission...

785
01:09:07,254 --> 01:09:11,213
to wipe out the entire Hutt clan.

786
01:09:13,393 --> 01:09:15,725
If it pleases you, mighty Jabba,

787
01:09:15,896 --> 01:09:20,230
this time I will deal
with Skywalker personally.

788
01:09:30,077 --> 01:09:32,978
I was hoping I'd never have to lay eyes
on this dust ball again.

789
01:09:33,146 --> 01:09:35,740
Okay. What happened?

790
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:39,408
I don't want to talk about it.
How's Stinky holding up?

791
01:09:40,153 --> 01:09:42,144
He seems to be feeling much better.

792
01:09:42,322 --> 01:09:46,281
His fever is gone. Even you have to admit
he's cute when he's asleep.

793
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:50,021
I admit I like him better when he's quiet,
but only a little.

794
01:09:51,265 --> 01:09:53,790
No, R2.
I want the cannon operational first.

795
01:09:53,867 --> 01:09:55,858
Leave the rear deflector shields for later.

796
01:09:56,069 --> 01:09:58,765
No rear shields, Master?
That's awful risky.

797
01:09:58,972 --> 01:10:01,270
A strong attack
eliminates the need for defense, Snips.

798
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:07,476
Attack ships closing!

799
01:10:10,951 --> 01:10:13,511
Somebody doesn't want Stinky
to get home in one piece.

800
01:10:16,456 --> 01:10:18,856
Wow! Quite a welcome home party!

801
01:10:19,993 --> 01:10:21,824
Set the approach vector
and make ready to land.

802
01:10:27,668 --> 01:10:29,329
Ahsoka, activate the guns!

803
01:10:31,204 --> 01:10:33,468
All the guns
are locked in the forward position.

804
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,041
It's too bad you decided not to repair
the rear deflector shields.

805
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,734
Not now, Ahsoka!

806
01:10:41,381 --> 01:10:43,576
R2, see if you can unlock those guns!

807
01:10:44,685 --> 01:10:47,711
Sometimes a good defense
is the best offense.

808
01:10:47,888 --> 01:10:49,822
Why don't you go
secure your little Huttlet friend?

809
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:52,720
None of us are secure with you flying!

810
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:55,550
Hang on, back there!

811
01:11:10,544 --> 01:11:12,444
Great! You woke the baby!

812
01:11:14,047 --> 01:11:15,844
I'm a little busy here!

813
01:11:22,222 --> 01:11:24,247
- Got one of them!
- What about the other one?

814
01:11:24,424 --> 01:11:26,051
One thing at a time!

815
01:11:32,199 --> 01:11:34,463
I think we needed
those rear shields after all.

816
01:11:35,235 --> 01:11:36,395
I told you so!

817
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:41,236
R2, turn those guns around!

818
01:11:43,143 --> 01:11:44,201
R2!

819
01:11:44,277 --> 01:11:48,008
Why can't you be a tiny little mouse droid?

820
01:11:59,459 --> 01:12:00,983
Get him, R2!

821
01:12:06,299 --> 01:12:08,392
Good shot, buddy!
You've been holding out on me.

822
01:12:15,976 --> 01:12:17,102
Ahsoka, strap in.

823
01:12:17,277 --> 01:12:20,144
- You've got that "we're in trouble" look.
- There's a look?

824
01:12:22,115 --> 01:12:25,084
- You can't miss it.
- Very funny, Snips.

825
01:12:25,318 --> 01:12:26,910
Obi-Wan, come in! Do you copy?

826
01:12:27,087 --> 01:12:30,147
<i>Kenobi, here. Anakin,</i>
<i>have you reached Tatooine yet?</i>

827
01:12:30,323 --> 01:12:33,622
- Almost, but we ran into some old...
<i>- Anakin, did you get shot down again?</i>

828
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,949
Yes!

829
01:12:35,128 --> 01:12:38,256
This ship is too slow.
I haven't had time to modify it yet.

830
01:12:38,432 --> 01:12:41,299
<i>I'm still cleaning up your other mess,</i>
<i>but I'll get there.</i>

831
01:12:41,468 --> 01:12:42,958
So much for reinforcements.

832
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,372
Hang on, this landing
could get a little rough.

833
01:12:49,543 --> 01:12:52,478
Crashes are rough. Landings are not.

834
01:12:52,546 --> 01:12:54,138
Then it's a crash landing.

835
01:13:15,068 --> 01:13:19,903
Mighty Jabba, my battle droids
have shot down Skywalker's ship.

836
01:13:25,011 --> 01:13:29,414
Jabba will send out his bounty hunters
to see that he is dead.

837
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:34,486
Allow me. I have much more experience
dealing with Jedi.

838
01:13:38,058 --> 01:13:40,424
<i>Anakin has reached Tatooine</i>
<i>with the Huttlet, Master,</i>

839
01:13:40,794 --> 01:13:42,523
<i>but he's still in grave danger.</i>

840
01:13:42,762 --> 01:13:44,957
<i>Separatist troops</i>
<i>are desperate to intercept him.</i>

841
01:13:45,365 --> 01:13:47,925
<i>I think this whole plot</i>
<i>was engineered by Dooku</i>

842
01:13:48,034 --> 01:13:50,093
<i>to convince Jabba we kidnapped his son.</i>

843
01:13:50,237 --> 01:13:54,867
If believe this, the Hutts do, ended will
our chance of a treaty with them be.

844
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:57,908
Join Dooku and the Separatists,
Jabba will, yes.

845
01:13:58,111 --> 01:14:00,079
That would be a disaster.

846
01:14:00,247 --> 01:14:04,411
We must have this alliance with the Hutts
if we are to win the war in the Outer Rim.

847
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:09,578
In Skywalker is the Republic's only hope.
Return Jabba's son, he must.

848
01:14:10,023 --> 01:14:13,390
<i>Anakin's experience with the Hutts</i>
<i>should help. He'll come through.</i>

849
01:14:19,232 --> 01:14:20,927
Please, excuse me, Master Yoda.

850
01:14:21,101 --> 01:14:24,070
I must return to
the grand adventure of politics.

851
01:14:24,704 --> 01:14:29,573
- Greetings, Senator Amidala.
- Master Yoda. So good to see you.

852
01:14:29,743 --> 01:14:32,541
Good, it is, to see you, Senator.

853
01:14:33,246 --> 01:14:35,544
Padm. We were to discuss...

854
01:14:35,715 --> 01:14:38,411
The new security measures
you put into effect on Naboo.

855
01:14:38,585 --> 01:14:41,952
My security chief tells me there are
several new battles in the Outer Rim.

856
01:14:42,122 --> 01:14:46,218
Including a small skirmish
with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin.

857
01:14:46,393 --> 01:14:48,258
Anakin? Is he in danger?

858
01:14:48,461 --> 01:14:51,589
I'm afraid the Jedi's efforts
to strike a secret treaty with the Hutts

859
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:53,096
have gone terribly wrong.

860
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:56,693
Jabba believes Anakin
has abducted his infant son.

861
01:14:57,003 --> 01:15:01,337
A Jedi would never do such a thing!
Perhaps I can get that treaty signed.

862
01:15:01,508 --> 01:15:04,909
I will go to the Hutts and convince them
of Anakin's innocence,

863
01:15:05,078 --> 01:15:07,410
as a representative
of the Senate, of course.

864
01:15:07,581 --> 01:15:11,608
That is very courageous of you, Senator,
but far too dangerous.

865
01:15:11,785 --> 01:15:14,015
Besides, we've attempted
to contact Jabba,

866
01:15:14,187 --> 01:15:16,519
he won't accept communication from us.

867
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:19,991
Jabba the Hutt has an uncle in the
old downtown area here on Coruscant.

868
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,459
Perhaps I can reason with him
and reopen negotiations.

869
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:26,098
Please, my dear, I beg you, reconsider this.

870
01:15:26,266 --> 01:15:29,827
Don't worry, Chancellor, I've dealt
with far worse than the Hutts.

871
01:15:30,036 --> 01:15:35,099
Do take care, Senator.
The Hutts are vile gangsters.

872
01:15:48,922 --> 01:15:50,412
Welcome home, Stinky.

873
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,252
Jabba's palace is on
the far side of the Dune Sea.

874
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,151
We'd better hurry
if we're gonna make it by morning.

875
01:16:00,867 --> 01:16:01,925
I'm coming.

876
01:16:05,605 --> 01:16:09,598
Oh, Artooie, it's just endless tracts
of gritty, abrasive sand.

877
01:16:09,776 --> 01:16:11,937
I'll clean your servos later. Come on.

878
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,754
O exalted majesty.

879
01:16:55,922 --> 01:16:59,016
What is it, Kronos-327?

880
01:16:59,759 --> 01:17:03,661
My mission to the twelfth moon
of Yout has failed.

881
01:17:06,099 --> 01:17:08,260
After all these years

882
01:17:08,535 --> 01:17:12,995
my most trusted of assassins
has finally failed.

883
01:17:13,773 --> 01:17:18,767
O Ziro the Hutt,
master of the Hutt clan on seven systems,

884
01:17:19,346 --> 01:17:23,407
I am sorry, your highness.
It will not happen again.

885
01:17:23,616 --> 01:17:25,914
I know. Take him away

886
01:17:25,985 --> 01:17:30,046
- and use him for spare parts!
- No, no! No!

887
01:17:53,847 --> 01:17:56,907
Your majesty,
you have an important visitor.

888
01:17:57,584 --> 01:18:01,645
Greetings, Ziro. I am Senator Amidala
of the Galactic Congress.

889
01:18:01,855 --> 01:18:04,915
A senator? In this neighborhood?

890
01:18:05,892 --> 01:18:07,325
Hmm.

891
01:18:09,295 --> 01:18:12,594
I know that you are the uncle
of Jabba the Hutt of Tatooine.

892
01:18:12,766 --> 01:18:14,165
I come to ask a favor of you.

893
01:18:14,334 --> 01:18:16,268
A favor? Hmm?

894
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:20,671
There has been a grave misunderstanding
between Jabba and the Order of the Jedi.

895
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,600
How may I serve you, Senator?

896
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:27,109
I was hoping you and I could resolve
this dispute and broker a treaty

897
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,771
between the Republic
and the great clan of the Hutts.

898
01:18:29,983 --> 01:18:34,113
A treaty? A treaty?
A treaty is impossible.

899
01:18:34,287 --> 01:18:38,314
My nephew Jabba's son has been
kidnapped by your Republic Jedi scum.

900
01:18:38,491 --> 01:18:41,153
But, sir, there's been a misunderstanding.

901
01:18:41,327 --> 01:18:43,693
There is no misunderstanding.

902
01:18:43,863 --> 01:18:48,129
It is the Jedi who have rescued his son.
If you can put me in touch with Jabba,

903
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:50,965
I am confident
I can convince him of the truth.

904
01:18:51,671 --> 01:18:55,402
No! No more discussions.
Escort her out!

905
01:18:55,575 --> 01:18:59,807
Please, Ziro! Your nephew Jabba
is in danger. You're being deceived.

906
01:19:00,013 --> 01:19:01,913
I said throw her out.

907
01:19:03,316 --> 01:19:04,840
Don't touch me.

908
01:19:27,841 --> 01:19:31,709
Master Yoda has a saying.
"Old sins cast long shadows."

909
01:19:31,878 --> 01:19:33,869
Do you know what he means by that?

910
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,412
He means your past can ruin your future
if you allow it.

911
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:38,813
But you forget
it was Master Skywalker who said,

912
01:19:39,118 --> 01:19:42,815
"I don't want to talk about my past."

913
01:19:43,389 --> 01:19:44,788
Okay, fine.

914
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:49,554
There is so much more we can talk about
out here. Like the sand.

915
01:19:49,929 --> 01:19:52,864
The desert is merciless.
It takes everything from you.

916
01:19:53,066 --> 01:19:56,695
That's a happy thought. It won't
take us, Master. Right, Artooie?

917
01:20:29,669 --> 01:20:35,266
Your plot is coming apart, Count Dooku!
A senator from the Republic was here.

918
01:20:35,441 --> 01:20:39,070
What if she found out
I helped you kidnap Jabba's son?

919
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:42,976
<i>Don't worry, I have convinced Jabba</i>
<i>that the Jedi have murdered his son</i>

920
01:20:43,149 --> 01:20:45,117
<i>and are on their way to kill him.</i>

921
01:20:45,285 --> 01:20:47,753
Jabba will slay the Jedi on sight!

922
01:20:48,121 --> 01:20:52,319
<i>Then the mighty Jedi Order will be forced</i>
<i>to bring Jabba to justice,</i>

923
01:20:52,492 --> 01:20:57,486
<i>and you, my friend, will be left</i>
<i>to take control of all the Hutt clans.</i>

924
01:20:58,298 --> 01:21:02,462
Then the plot against my nephew Jabba
has succeeded.

925
01:21:02,802 --> 01:21:04,827
But what about this meddling senator?

926
01:21:05,004 --> 01:21:07,438
<i>If she continues her investigation,</i>

927
01:21:07,941 --> 01:21:11,274
<i>have her meet with an accident</i>
<i>with extreme prejudice.</i>

928
01:21:11,711 --> 01:21:14,771
<i>I will have someone in the Senate</i>
<i>cover it up.</i>

929
01:21:22,689 --> 01:21:24,486
Count Dooku.

930
01:21:25,525 --> 01:21:30,019
So, the poisonous traitor
rears his ugly head once again.

931
01:21:30,196 --> 01:21:34,292
<i>I'm equally delighted to remake</i>
<i>your acquaintance, Senator</i>

932
01:21:34,534 --> 01:21:36,331
<i>Amidala, isn't it?</i>

933
01:21:36,636 --> 01:21:38,536
I was just leaving.

934
01:21:39,138 --> 01:21:41,800
<i>I'm sorry, that cannot be permitted now.</i>

935
01:21:41,941 --> 01:21:47,675
<i>Ziro, this particular senator is</i>
<i>extremely valuable to my Separatist allies.</i>

936
01:21:48,047 --> 01:21:50,242
<i>They will pay a handsome price for her.</i>

937
01:21:50,416 --> 01:21:51,644
Hmm.

938
01:21:51,718 --> 01:21:55,848
I like the sound of that.
Take her to the dungeon!

939
01:21:56,055 --> 01:21:57,989
You will regret this, Ziro!

940
01:21:58,324 --> 01:22:01,816
No, I think I will become rich with this!

941
01:22:04,564 --> 01:22:06,657
Thank you, Count Dooku.

942
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:10,234
<i>This has been a most profitable alliance.</i>

943
01:22:11,204 --> 01:22:14,833
I will contact you when the Huttlet
has been disposed of,

944
01:22:15,008 --> 01:22:18,341
your high exalted master of the Hutts.

945
01:22:21,514 --> 01:22:25,416
Count Dooku, we have picked up
three life forms crossing the desert.

946
01:22:26,119 --> 01:22:28,178
One is a very young Huttlet.

947
01:22:29,355 --> 01:22:30,845
Skywalker.

948
01:22:38,931 --> 01:22:40,398
We're not alone.

949
01:22:40,566 --> 01:22:43,729
I sense it, too.
It's the dark side of the Force.

950
01:22:47,273 --> 01:22:50,800
Whatever it is, it's coming for the Hutt.
Time to split up.

951
01:22:50,943 --> 01:22:52,911
We'll face it together, Master.

952
01:22:53,079 --> 01:22:56,139
Not this time, Snips. I have a far more
important mission for you.

953
01:22:56,315 --> 01:22:57,976
More important than keeping you alive?

954
01:22:58,151 --> 01:23:00,449
Ahsoka, I need you to
trust me on this one.

955
01:23:18,638 --> 01:23:19,969
What's that?

956
01:23:20,139 --> 01:23:23,472
Don't touch that! Whatever you do,
keep away from it.

957
01:23:23,643 --> 01:23:25,634
Please. I beg you.

958
01:23:25,945 --> 01:23:27,173
Don't turn that on.

959
01:23:27,346 --> 01:23:29,814
Could be dangerous. I better check it out.

960
01:23:30,983 --> 01:23:34,976
<i>At last, you answered!</i>
<i>Oh, I've been so worried.</i>

961
01:23:35,788 --> 01:23:38,256
<i>Wait! Who are you?</i>
<i>You're not Mistress Padm!</i>

962
01:23:38,424 --> 01:23:41,450
3PO, get help!
I'm being held by Ziro the Hutt!

963
01:23:41,627 --> 01:23:45,085
<i>You're in trouble! I knew it!</i>
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

964
01:24:06,519 --> 01:24:10,285
Surrender the Huttlet or die, Skywalker.

965
01:24:28,307 --> 01:24:31,071
Your training has come a long way, boy.

966
01:24:43,055 --> 01:24:47,048
Now I remember.
This was your home planet, wasn't it?

967
01:24:47,693 --> 01:24:53,029
I sense your strong feelings.
Feelings of pain, loss.

968
01:25:19,025 --> 01:25:23,621
You've failed, Jedi.
I have just killed Jabba's son.

969
01:25:23,796 --> 01:25:27,732
You've fallen for my little trick, Count.
It's nothing but rocks.

970
01:25:28,801 --> 01:25:32,635
The Huttlet is with my Padawan,
safely at Jabba's palace.

971
01:25:32,805 --> 01:25:35,968
I expected such treachery from a Jedi.

972
01:25:36,142 --> 01:25:42,081
I assure you my web is strong enough
to catch your insignificant little Padawan.

973
01:25:42,381 --> 01:25:44,406
She's more skillful than you think.

974
01:25:45,451 --> 01:25:47,442
You deceive yourself!

975
01:26:15,982 --> 01:26:19,418
Look, I have a message
from your Padawan.

976
01:26:30,129 --> 01:26:32,859
After my droids kill Jabba's son,

977
01:26:33,432 --> 01:26:38,426
they will deliver your Padawan to him
for punishment for the Huttlet's murder.

978
01:26:39,138 --> 01:26:41,936
I can't imagine he will be merciful.

979
01:27:02,028 --> 01:27:03,086
R2!

980
01:27:05,865 --> 01:27:08,834
Three against two?
Stinky, you watch my back!

981
01:27:33,693 --> 01:27:36,321
I thought you liked to play in the sand.

982
01:27:49,608 --> 01:27:53,066
This part of town is definitely
not my kind of town.

983
01:27:56,849 --> 01:27:59,340
You tried to call for help, Senator.

984
01:27:59,719 --> 01:28:03,086
I believe you are too dangerous
to be kept alive.

985
01:28:03,255 --> 01:28:05,314
Killing a Galactic Senator,
here on Coruscant?

986
01:28:05,591 --> 01:28:06,922
Are you out of your mind?

987
01:28:07,059 --> 01:28:08,117
I have powerful friends in the Senate.

988
01:28:09,295 --> 01:28:10,887
I'm not afraid of... Huh?

989
01:28:15,034 --> 01:28:16,399
Is anybody home?

990
01:28:16,569 --> 01:28:17,627
3PO?

991
01:28:17,803 --> 01:28:19,065
What is that?

992
01:28:19,905 --> 01:28:21,372
- Go, go, go!
- Give it all you got.

993
01:28:23,142 --> 01:28:24,769
Run for it!

994
01:28:37,623 --> 01:28:40,217
Stop, Ziro! Stop right where you are!

995
01:28:42,495 --> 01:28:46,090
Mistress Padm, are you all right?
Was I too late?

996
01:28:46,332 --> 01:28:49,392
3PO. Your timing was perfect.

997
01:28:49,468 --> 01:28:52,164
Oh, thank the maker! I'm so relieved.

998
01:28:52,471 --> 01:28:55,634
- Should we arrest the Hutt, Senator?
- I had no choice.

999
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:59,904
Dooku said he'd kill me if I didn't help him
kidnap Jabba's son.

1000
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:03,742
You have to believe me!
I love that Huttlet!

1001
01:29:03,816 --> 01:29:05,647
Oh, I believe you.

1002
01:29:15,895 --> 01:29:19,194
Master! Over here! Master!

1003
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:22,258
He never listens.

1004
01:29:29,542 --> 01:29:32,272
- Where is my Padawan?
- This way.

1005
01:29:33,012 --> 01:29:34,775
Your weapon, please.

1006
01:29:45,224 --> 01:29:48,853
Okay, stick-tinnies, you're going back
to Dooku in pieces.

1007
01:29:49,462 --> 01:29:52,488
This is Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.

1008
01:29:52,631 --> 01:29:53,757
As Count Dooku said,

1009
01:29:54,133 --> 01:29:55,657
your son is not with him.

1010
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:57,731
What? Your son's not here?

1011
01:29:59,371 --> 01:30:00,565
Where's Ahsoka?

1012
01:30:20,426 --> 01:30:22,053
What have you done with my Padawan?

1013
01:30:26,031 --> 01:30:28,295
You came here to kill Jabba.

1014
01:30:28,367 --> 01:30:30,927
Mighty Jabba, I came here to negotiate.

1015
01:30:41,547 --> 01:30:46,382
Being a Padawan is harder than I thought.
Let's get you home.

1016
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:52,953
You came here to die.

1017
01:30:53,859 --> 01:30:54,951
Stop!

1018
01:31:15,281 --> 01:31:18,182
You are to be executed immediately.

1019
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:19,547
- What?
- What?

1020
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:24,551
- Does this always happen to you?
- Everywhere I go.

1021
01:31:29,995 --> 01:31:33,055
Your Uncle Ziro is contacting us.

1022
01:31:34,667 --> 01:31:35,929
<i>Greetings, honorable Jabba.</i>

1023
01:31:36,101 --> 01:31:39,229
<i>I am Senator Amidala</i>
<i>of the Galactic Congress.</i>

1024
01:31:39,405 --> 01:31:41,839
<i>I have discovered a plot against you</i>
<i>by one of your own.</i>

1025
01:31:42,007 --> 01:31:44,840
<i>Your uncle will admit he conspired</i>
<i>with Count Dooku to kidnap your son</i>

1026
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:47,444
<i>and frame the Jedi for the crime.</i>

1027
01:31:58,924 --> 01:32:00,516
<i>It was Count Dooku!</i>

1028
01:32:05,998 --> 01:32:10,162
Ziro will be dealt with
by the Hutt family most severely.

1029
01:32:10,369 --> 01:32:13,566
<i>Perhaps now you will allow the Republic</i>
<i>to use your trade routes</i>

1030
01:32:13,639 --> 01:32:15,402
<i>and hostilities can come to an end.</i>

1031
01:32:21,347 --> 01:32:24,839
Jabba agrees. A treaty is in order.

1032
01:32:25,017 --> 01:32:26,644
<i>You will not regret this, Jabba.</i>

1033
01:32:30,322 --> 01:32:33,883
The clone armies
may move through Jabba's territories.

1034
01:32:34,059 --> 01:32:37,551
Senator, you have my undying gratitude.

1035
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:42,497
<i>No, Master Skywalker, it is I,</i>
<i>and the Republic, who owes you thanks.</i>

1036
01:32:48,674 --> 01:32:51,142
Jabba would be most appreciative

1037
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:55,679
if you bring Dooku to justice
for his crimes against the Hutts.

1038
01:32:55,881 --> 01:32:57,906
You can count on it, Jabba.

1039
01:33:04,556 --> 01:33:06,649
It is unfortunate, Master.

1040
01:33:06,825 --> 01:33:11,091
The Jedi armies will now have
their supply routes to the Outer Rim.

1041
01:33:11,263 --> 01:33:15,007
Our fight has become
far more difficult.

1042
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:18,399
<i>Allow the Jedi</i>
<i>their small victory, my friend,</i>

1043
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:22,529
<i>for the engines of this war</i>
<i>turn in our favor.</i>

1044
01:38:21,039 --> 01:38:22,029
