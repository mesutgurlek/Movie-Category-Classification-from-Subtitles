Here's our man.
Professor Howard Plummer.

4
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,607
He's been kidnapped
by a group of Serbian rebels.

5
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:52,811
l know we've been up for 72
hours, but l expect perfection.

00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,854
Nothing else.

The enemy has a boat,
four jet skis, and a chopper.

9
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,092
l'll take you guys in
until we hit radar range.

10
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,826
Then you'll dive from there.

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,663
Once we hit our target,

12
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,431
Red One, Red Two,
you take out our escorts.

13
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:15,031
l'll handle the chopper,
and l'll find the professor.

Red Three, you radio in
for our copter.

- Sir, yes sir!

- [SEALS] Sir, yes sir!

17

We are SEALS.
And this is what we do.

- Where is the briefcase?
- [grunting]

lt's right behind you.
Man, am l glad to see you.

00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:43,014
- l never thought l'd see my family...
- l'll get you out.

36
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,414
We're gonna do it my way.
No highway option.

37
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,180
Yeah, l'm with you. Absolutely.

38
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,135
Lieutenant, thank you so much
for saving my life.

39
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,608
lf l had died back there,
my wife, she would've killed me.

40
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,077
Just a joke.

41
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,877
Do you mind if l call my wife
to tell her l'm okay?

42
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,713
l have strict orders
to get you out of here safely.

43
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,946
We gotta keep moving.

44
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,047
Lieutenant, l am safe.
Please. She thinks l'm dead.

45
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,059
- All right, make it quick.
- Okay.

46
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,790

[chuckles] Hey.

49
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,998
These are my kids.

50
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,434
You'd like 'em.
They're really great.

51
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,971
l doubt it. Hurry up.

52
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,107
Hey! We're almost ready.

53
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,482
Give us another sec.

healed up real good, Shane.

57
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,404
l should've been
out of here weeks ago.

58
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,497
Look, l know heads
are gonna roll for this.

59
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,871
Hey, you took a bullet.

60
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,604
Yeah, but l want you to know
l take full responsibility

61
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,475
for what happened
to the professor.

62
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,776
Plummer was the best
security expert

63
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,714
the Department of Defense
ever had.

64
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,743
He was working on a program to scramble
launch codes that he called ''GHOST'':

65
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,255
Guided High-altitude
Scrambling Transmitter.

66
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,985
One pulse from a GHOST satellite

67
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,118
and a country can't launch
its own nukes.

68
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,389
That's why the Serbians
kidnapped him.

69
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,921
They must have thought that
GHOST was in that briefcase.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,969
GHOST is still out there.

71
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,937
Which is why l'm sending you
back in.

72
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,440
l know you've never lost anybody
before, Shane.

73
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,943
l was with your father
when he led a platoon...

74
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,172
With all due respect,

75
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,681
l'd appreciate it if we kept
my father out of this.

76
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,513
All l'm saying is that it
happens to the best of them.

77
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,051
And you're the best.

78
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,112
l need someone l can trust on this

79
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,455
- and l know l can trust you.
- Okay.

80
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,789
l'll put a team together.

81
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,920
No. lt's not
that kind of mission.

82
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,864
This is at the top of the Pentagon's
priority list.

83
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,864
[man] Two days ago,
I got a call from Admiral Blair.

84
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,136
It seems that the professor's widow
contacted him.

85
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,699
Whoever killed her husband

86
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,938
must think that GHOST
is still in that house.

87
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,072
Now, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

88
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:33,209
A safety deposit box has been discovered
in >urich in the Plummers' name.

89
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,086
I've been assigned to escort Mrs.
Plummer there to retrieve the contents.

90
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,148
We're hoping it's the GHOSTprogram.

91
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,093
In the meantime, someone
needs to watch over those kids.

92
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,754
That's where you come in.

93
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,959
While there, you'll be looking
for the hidden program as well.

94
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,594

00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,183
Ah!

98
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,432
You must be Lieutenant Wolfe!
Admiral Blair said you'd be coming.

99
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,525
Come on in.
Meet the rest of the gang.

100
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,797
Come on.

101
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:30,070
Kids! Get your butts
down here and say hello!

102
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:35,512
Okay, you've already met Lulu.
This is Zoe, Seth and Peter.

103
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,448
Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe.

104
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,452
He's gonna stay with you
while l'm away.

105

- That's a pretty dress.

with butcher tonight.

110
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,202
l want to look nice.

111
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,534
[gasping] Ah!

[whimpering]

114
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,741
You have a pleasant family.

115
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,716
Well, for the younger ones,

116
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,844
l think it hasn't really
sunk in yet.

117
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,857
lt's been hardest
on Zoe and Seth.

118
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,257
But they don't really
like to talk about it.

119
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,625
Well, it must be hard
on all of you.

120
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,994
[Mrs. Plummer]
Howard wasn't around much.

121
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,124
His work took him
all over the world.

122
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,998
He'd be gone six,
seven months at a time.

123
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,300
Yeah, l can understand
that lifestyle.

124
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,502
Anyway, about a week ago,

125
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,910
someone broke into the house.
No one was home.

126
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,676
l didn't tell the kids 'cause
l didn't wanna scare them.

127
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,478
Mrs. Plummer, l've dealt with...

128
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,746
- Ow! Oh, my God!
- [quacking]

129
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,153
l'm sorry. That's Gary.
He was Howard's.

130
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,088
Gary, down!

131
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,717
He bit me.

132
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,887
Yeah, well,
he thinks he's a guard dog.

133
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:01,491
- Mrs. Plummer?
- Oh, call me Julie. Please.

134
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,365
l'm gonna go outside
and have a look around.

135
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,802
Out, out.

136
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,200
l'm gonna miss you.
Mmm...

137
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,106
l'm gonna miss you too.

138
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,941
l'll be back in 48 hours, okay?

139
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,710
Bye, pumpkin.
l love you, pumpkin.

140
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,588
Oh, and kids? Remember,

141
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,217
whatever Lieutenant Wolfe
asks you to do, do it.

142
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,318
Mom, chill.
We're gonna be fine.

143
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,793
l'm sorry.
l don't do this very often.

144
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,563
You're going away for a few days.

145
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,933
Yeah, l know.

146
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,869
l got it.

147
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,600
Okay. Here you go, Helga.

148
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,701
- l take baby.
- Bye. Bye.

149
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,246
- lt's okay.
- [baby cries]

150
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,645
You remember
the emergency numbers, right?

151
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,708
Don't worry, Mrs. Plummer,
your kids'll be safe with me.

152
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,620
Your little angels will be fine,
Mrs. Plummer.

153
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,063
- Go.
- [engine turns]

154
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,600
- [Helga] Bye-bye.
- Bye.

155
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,693
[Helga] Have some fun.

156
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,001
[chuckles] Bye-bye.

157
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,538
Tell me,
are you licensed to kill?

158
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,239
No, ma'am.

159
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:59,341

Teenager? I wanted to tell you

340
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,190
[Wolfe] Just hang...

[both panting]

342

[bells ringing]

354
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,569
Okay, everybody, listen up.
There's been a change of plans.

355
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,372
Your mother's not coming home
as soon as she expected.

356
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,970
- When is she coming back?

For now,

That's what we've been doing?
Having fun?

Whoa, okay, Halt. Halt!

00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,825
We'll take this hill
one inch at a time.

Only then can we rise

Ooh. Soak that up a bit.

Hi. Zoe says you look

Did you ever punch someone
so hard that their head came off?

No.

381
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,961
Why are your boobs so big?

382
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,724
They're not boobs.

383
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,961
Do you have to wear a bra?

384
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,701
Will my boobs
get as big as yours someday?

385
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,113
You know, little girl,

386
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:50,951

nappy-poo in beddy-bye land.

Stay away from the cheese.

Yes, we'll be right there.

Who was that?

412
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,295
Your vice principal.

413
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,835
He said that if you and Seth

you're both suspended.

lf you don't hurry up,

Not on my watch.

No? Good.

Wow, it looks like you

coming out of your shoulders.

442

469
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,139

00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,248
Okay.

476
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,793
- Can l get you some coffee?
- Yes, please.

477
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,230
So, what's with this Murninator?

478
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,894
He's big, he's hairy,
he's sometimes smelly,

479
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,164
but he's harmless
and he has tenure.

480
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,832
[sighs] So, you're the bodyguard?

481
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,705
Mrs. Plummer thought the kids...

482
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:15,212
She briefed me on everything
and she told me that the kids

483
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,180
aren't fully aware of the situation

484
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,341
and that's the way she wants it.

485
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,187
She also told me
you're a ''Teams'' guy.

486
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,156
- Yes, l am.
- Well, Petty Officer Third Class

487
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:30,251
- Claire Fletcher at your service.
- You're kidding.

488
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,491
Four years at Naval Base
Coronado. They paid for college.

489
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,398
- Honor, courage.
- Commitment.

490
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,628
lt's the way l run this school.

491
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,034
l like that.

492
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:47,706
So, permission to stick around
and keep eyes on the kids?

493
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,043
Permission granted.

494
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,548
[kids chattering]

495
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,487
[girls] We don't need no music
We don't need no band

496
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,462
All we need is Mustangs
and jammin' in the stands

497
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,795
We said jammin' in the stands

498
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,132
J-A-M-M-I-N
Jammin' in the stands

499
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:16,230
What? J-A-M-M-I-N
Jammin' in the stands

500
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,333
- Go, Mustangs! Whoo!
- [beeping]

501
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,811
[Wolfe] ''Black belt.
Honorable discharge.''

502
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,872
Clean as a whistle.

503
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,416
[chuckles]

504
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,749
- Yeah, you little punk!
- Where's your babysitter now?

505
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,420
Hey!

506
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,360
- Enough.
- All right, you heard the lady.

507
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,023
Let's break it up, guys.
Come on. Hmm?

508
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,762
Relax, Popeye.
Boys will be boys, huh?

509
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:48,670
lt's kinda good for the Creeper.
Gives him a chance to punk up.

510
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,039
- Learn to defend himself.
- Six against one?

511
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,044
Well, the odds are never pretty.

512
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,444
But look at it as, like,
a preparation for him.

513
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,243
The naked streets of Bethesda

514
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,442
can be so dark and dangerous.

515
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,546
- Right, Creeper?
- Ooh. Whoa.

516
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,852
You're pretty quick there, frogman.

517
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,155
l, myself,
happen to be a black belt.

518
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,957
That's why they wanted me
to coach the wrestling team.

519
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,464
Ooh-ah! [snorts]

520
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,796
Sensei. [neck cracks]

521
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,029
You know what that's called, homeboy?

522
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,435
Total control.

523
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,064
You all right? Hmm?

524
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,939
Maybe sometime you can pop by
the wrestling class

525
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,672
and, uh, we'll show the boys
how a couple pros do it.

526
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,771
What do you think?
l'll go easy on you.

527
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,510
- l'm on duty.
- You're on duty.

528
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,677
Oh, that's right,
you're a babysitter.

529
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,779
So it's kinda like ''doo-doo'' duty.

530
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,881
[laughs]

531
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,620
Don't worry about it.

532
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:46,630
We'll do it on a day when you're
not, uh, washing your hair. Hmm?

533
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,160
And l'll see you in class.

534
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,004
At ease.

535
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,466
That guy don't have his head on right.

536
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:02,239
l was fine!
l don't need your help!

537
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,084
Okay, okay.

538
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:13,419
- Aw. Hey, rough day?
- l tried feeding him.

539
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,083
Yeah? Did you try changing him?

540
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,957
- Would you help me?
- No.

541
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,691
- Just the thought of...
- [beeping]

542
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,206
- Emergency.
- What are you...? l... Hey!

543
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,807
Hi.

Where are you going?

549
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:24,293
[man] Hey!
What's wrong with you?

550
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,534
[beeping continues]

Call me, you guys,

556
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,584
My number's on the fridge.

557
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,146
Are you okay?

558

Call me if you need anything.
Okay?

564

After you shower.
Or, before. lt doesn't matter.

Lulu, can l see you

Who are those people?

My troop. Monday, Wednesday

- Get rid of 'em.

Parents go out on troop nights.
They'll be back at 8:00.

Mom's our den mother!

You better tell your little

- Today we're supposed to sell cookies.
- l don't do cookies.

We have to. lf we don't

00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,084
we can't go

All right, ladies!
Here's how it's gonna be!

- Helga's fine.

593

- When are you getting home?
- I'm sorry...

594

Those boys over there

Broke your cookies.

You call those people
your friends?

They have no respect for your home.

wanted me to!

788
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:39,012
Do you think girls
will think l'm weird?

789
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,990
They probably already do, Seth.

790
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:44,322
But you'll kill 'em later.

791
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,624
Come here.

792
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:52,156
Forget about everyone else
for a second.

793
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,500
ls performing
what makes you happy?

794
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,040
Yeah,
more than anything.

795
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,135
All right, fall in.

796
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,977
Company. Center stage.

797
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:11,514
Company! Center stage!

798
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:14,455
Who is this guy?

799
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:19,894
Now, do you or do you not have
what it takes to perform this musical?

800
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,763
- We don't have a director.
- l've directed rescue missions

801
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,267
all around the world.

802
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,396
l've directed numerous
snatch-and-grabs

803
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:34,205
from countries whose names
you are not allowed to know.

804
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:38,976
l've choreographed
multi-pronged amphibious landings

805
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,574
and stealth air attacks!

806
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:46,782
Do you think l have
the military proficiency...

807
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:49,916
...to direct this production?

808
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,460
Yes.

809
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,395
- Yes, what?
- [all] Yes, sir!

810
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:54,564
[Wolfe] Once upon a time,
there was a family...

811
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,431
[Wolfe] Once upon a time,
there was a family...

812
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,297
...of elves.

813
00:53:59,335 --> 00:54:04,602
And one day the little elf family

814
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:08,007
went into the magic forest

815
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,309
to find a secret...

816
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,440
...gnome...

817
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,881
...facility,

818
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:20,821
where the gnomes were
turning mushrooms into uranium.

819
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:26,829
So three elves laid down heavy
suppressive fire on the gnomes

820
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:32,232
while the others maneuvered
around to the right flank,

821
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:36,636
finishing off anything left alive.

822
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,504
[sighs]

823
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:44,878
And not one of those elves
were left behind that day.

824
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,109
We got 'em all.

825
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:53,450
Even the teeniest...

826
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:57,459
...littlest elf of all...

827
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,859
...Rodriguez.

828
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,456
You're gonna have to do
the Panda dance or he won't stop.

829
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,058
- Oh, come on...
- [baby crying]

830
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,297
l don't know how to do
the Panda dance.

831
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,862
l'll write it down for you.

832
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,932
Close your eyes. Go to sleep.
l'll be right back.

833
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,774
You gotta do the dance.

834
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:20,976
Like Dad used to do.
He made it up for him.

835
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,712
[Seth] You have to do the dance
to make him sleep.

836
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:27,688
Come on.

837
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:33,127
# When you're down and low
Lower than the floor

838
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:38,498
# And you think that you
ain't got a chance, bum, bum

839
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,368
# Don't make a move
till you're in the groove

840
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:44,963
- Lulu.
- Thank you.

841
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,271
Seth.

842
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,004
Zoe. Uh!

843
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:50,978
Today you drive.

844
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:54,175
But l can't even
pass Driver's Ed.

845
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,445
Exactly.

846
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,348
We're all gonna die.

847
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,153
Have you ever given
a driving lesson before?

848
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,924
ln a minivan? No.

849
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:10,397
Think of it like
a Bradley Assault Vehicle.

850
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:12,058
Especially when Zoe's driving.

851
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,234
- [gasps]
- [tires screeching]

852
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,208
- [Lulu] Zoe Plummer!
- [Seth] Zoe, what are you doing?

853
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,767
- [Seth] What are...? Slow down!
- [Lulu] Truck!

854
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:24,779
[screaming]

855
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,120
- [Wolfe] Whoa! Whoa!
- [tires screeching]

856
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,055
- [Lulu] Whoa!
- [Wolfe] Not bad.

857
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:41,522
Land! Solid land!

858
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:45,591
- l think it went well.
- Oh, it's so dramatic.

859
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,527
Hey, hey, hey. No fighting.

860
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,267
- Play nicely.
- [boy] Sorry.

861
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,969
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

862
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:58,309
l have noticed an improvement in the
Plummer kids and l'm very impressed.

863
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,474
Yeah, you know,
they're just misunderstood.

864
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:04,111
[Wolfe] Peter, careful!
Don't make me come up there!

865
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,883
Someone needs to take the time
to talk to 'em.

866
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:11,290
- You're getting a little attached.
- l take my job very seriously.

867
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,258
But it's like you said.
They're just kids.

868
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:19,529
Well, keep up the good work.

869
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,966
Oh!

870
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,405
You look very nice today.

871
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:30,409
Oh. Thanks.

872
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,007
l don't think you understand.
Don't you ever do that again.

873
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,517
ls that clear?
Okay, l've had it.

874
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:40,682
l caught the kid dancing to no music.
l want him out of my class.

875
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:43,658
Somebody's gotta give this punk
a talking to.

876
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,456
Seth?

877
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,396
Well, you got something
to say, twinkle toes?

878
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,502
Yeah. Yeah, l do, Murney.

879
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:55,764
- l quit.
- You quit.

880
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:58,830
You know why you quit?
Because you're a quitter.

881
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,877
And everybody knows
that quitters...

882
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:03,411
...quit.

883
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,149
What are you scared of, Prancer?

884
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:12,313
- l'm not scared. l want to act.
- And l want to take up origami.

885
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,755
- l'm in The Sound of Music.
- Oh. A musical.

886
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,487
You're giving up wrestling
to be in a musical.

887
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,223
That happens when there
isn't a man in the house.

888
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:25,165
There is a man
in the house. lt's me.

889
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:29,227
[laughing] Well,
it's gotta be a tiny house.

890
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,600
You think you're tough, boy,
don't you?

891
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,281
Wanna shave the tiger?
Do you? Huh?

892
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,182
- You want it tough?
- Where did you wanna do this?

893
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:46,381
- What are you talking about?
- You said you wanted to wrestle.

894
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,617
Where? When?

895
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,252
- After school.
- [Wolfe] Okay.

896
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:57,290
- Today?
- That's right. The gym.

897
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,925
Okay?

898
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:03,700
Remember. You mess with
the bull, you get the horns.

899
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:06,139
[snorting]

900
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:14,846
[Murney] Out of my way!

901
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:19,752
- How did that feel?
- lt was good.

902
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,760
[boy] Murney is getting
his butt kicked at 3:00!

903
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,492
[cheering, pounding bleachers]

904
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:38,035
Oh, that is so gross.

905
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:41,508
[Murney] Come on! Come on!

906
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:44,978
What? That's it!

907
00:59:45,047 --> 00:59:48,574
Someone's gonna get hurt today
and you know who it is?

908
00:59:55,558 --> 01:00:00,154
You're about to enter
Murney's House of Pain!

909
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:05,292
What do you say we go over
the rules, cue ball? Huh?

910
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,136
[crowd] Oooh!

911
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,570
Rule number one.

912
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,906
Never be too eager
to rush your opponent.

913
01:00:14,977 --> 01:00:19,778
Wanna play prison rules, frogman?
Wanna play prison rules? You got it.

914
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,875
- l'll be your daddy.
- [crowd cheering]

915
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:28,183
- [cracking]
- Ah!

916
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:31,090
All right.
Now you've unlocked the beast.

917
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,486
Oh, God!

918
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,293
From this position,
it's relatively easy

919
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:39,960
- to manipulate your opponent.
- Ohhh!

920
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,333
[groaning]

921
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:43,668
And thus we have
the chicken wing.

922
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:47,165
The chicken wing. [screams]

923
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,972
The arm bar.

924
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:53,479
The crow bar.
Or my personal favorite...

925
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:57,383
- Ahhhh!
- ...the pacifier!

926
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,523
Any questions?

927
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,829
Anything you
didn't understand?

928
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,894
Ah. The nipple crippler.

929
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:18,873
This is a useless, not to mention,
shameless move

930
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:22,934
that ultimately is a sure sign
of desperation.

931
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,179
And finally...

932
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,550
Pinned!

933
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:39,786
That was awesome!

934
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,629
- Are you okay, Murney?
- Get away from me!

935
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,899
Can l get a little help, please?
l can't move my back. Watch the back!

936
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,188
Go!

937
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,227
Sorry!

938
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,100
l didn't get that cone!

939
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,112
Crawl!

940
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,587
[beeping]

941
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:54,025
See? But he usually
breaks down the door.

942
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,818
[tires screech]

943
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:24,764
Excellent!
Now do it backwards.

944
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,839
Okay.

945
01:03:37,913 --> 01:03:42,873

[Lulu] Shane! You can't do this!
You can't leave a man behind!

1103
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:43,148
Hold on, l got it.

1104
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,520
[Zoe] Shane!

1105
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:48,028
- Where's Mom?
- Mom?

1106
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,064
l'll find her.
You guys run and get help!

1107
01:17:50,131 --> 01:17:52,565
- [crying]
- Hurry!

1108
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,534
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

1109
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:56,798
Yes, Lulu. Go, get help.

1110
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:03,340
Hold on!

1111
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,003
[speaking in foreign language]

1112
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,412
They're headed for the car!

1113
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:10,508
- [Lulu] Zoe, call 91 1 .
- l forgot my cell phone.

1114
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:14,385
- [Seth] Great. The only time you don't.
- [Zoe] We're gonna be okay!

1115
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,201
Oh, my God!
What do we do?

1116
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:28,497
Find a cop!

1117
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,338
Ahh!

1118
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,712
[screaming]

1119
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,024
- He's gaining on us.
- l'll handle it.

1120
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:57,754
[screaming]

1121
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:01,597
[Chun yelling]

1122
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:03,793
[screaming]

1123
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:20,417
[yelling]

1124
01:19:20,488 --> 01:19:22,922
Look, Zoe! lt's the cops!

1125
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:28,185
[siren wails]

1126
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:34,693
l assume you heard the Baloney
Bandit has struck again.

1127
01:19:34,769 --> 01:19:39,934
l accept total responsibility.
My intelligence, well, it was faulty.

1128
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,704
- lf l had better resources...
- [siren wails]

1129
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:56,285
l told you not to pass her
in Driver's Ed.

1130
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:56,458
You have exactly three seconds
to get me through this mine field.

1131
01:19:56,458 --> 01:20:00,053
You have exactly three seconds
to get me through this mine field.

1132
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:03,996
- One, two...
- [Wolfe] Bill.

1133
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:06,533
She doesn't know.

1134
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:09,866
And you're not taking another
parent away from those kids.

1135
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:12,406
Leave the family alone
and l'll get you in.

1136
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,998
You better not be bluffing.

1137
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:22,675
Zoe! Seth!

1138
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:26,585
Lulu! Peter! Tyler!

1139
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:31,184
Ah!

1140
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:34,695
That was the code. l saw Mr. Plummer
use it to open the briefcase.

1141
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:39,723
You think this is a game?
Code or no code, open it. Now.

1142
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,666
You can't make him do this.

1143
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:45,069
l know Howard.
You haven't got a chance.

1144
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:55,648
# When you're down and low
Lower than the floor

1145
01:20:55,717 --> 01:21:01,178
# And you feel like you
don't have a chance

1146
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:07,825
# Don't make a move
till you're in the groove

1147
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:12,492
# And do the
Peter Panda dance

1148
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:16,936
# Hop three times
like a kangaroo

1149
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:21,840
# Side-step twice
just like the crabs do

1150
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:25,209
# Three steps forward
One step back

1151
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,477
Quick like a turtle!
Lie on your back!

1152
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,678
# Roll like a log
till you can't no more

1153
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:35,120
# Betterjump quick
like there ain't no floor

1154
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:42,323
# Hold your breath
Step to the left

1155
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:55,000
And that's
the Peter Panda dance.

1156
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:58,136
All right. Go.

1157
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,113
Yeah, right.

1158
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:03,208
Okay, l'll go first.

1159
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:15,257
Great work, Shane.
l knew you'd figure it out.

1160
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,424
l think you'd better open it.

1161
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:23,762
Wait, wait, wait!

1162
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:26,102
Back away.

1163
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:29,977
You open it.

1164
01:22:30,044 --> 01:22:32,444
Come on.
l walked the floor first.

1165
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,675
No way.
You can do it, soldier man.

1166
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:36,442
[Julie] Ah!

1167
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,486
[grunting]

1168
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,529
Ahhh!

1169
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:07,010
[panting]

1170
01:23:08,716 --> 01:23:10,547
Any last words, Shane?

1171
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,677
Say good night,
Peter Panda.

1172
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:23,457
Shane, are you okay?

1173
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,294
Oh!

1174
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:30,103
She was never
a good neighbor.

1175
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:02,828
Zoe, you're going too fast!

1176
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,895
You're not gonna
have time to stop!

1177
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:08,340
Who said anything about
stopping? l'm parking.

1178
01:24:08,409 --> 01:24:10,206
[tires screeching]

1179
01:24:21,789 --> 01:24:25,782
- What are you doing to these kids?
- [cop] Hands where l can see them!

1180
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,090
[Wolfe] Okay. Calm down.

1181
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:30,392
Everybody!
Put your weapons down!

1182
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,202
l want the GHOST.

1183
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:37,500
[quacking]

1184
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:46,410
[Wolfe] Um.... Calm down.
lt's just a duck.

1185
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:48,779
- [Chun] Where's the GHOST?
- [Wolfe] l have it.

1186
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:52,250
[Chun] Bring it here!

1187
01:24:57,892 --> 01:24:59,291
Put it on the ground.

1188
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,561
[whispering] Now, Gary.
Go for his balls.

1189
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:11,264
Okay, duck whisperer,
step away!

1190
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:19,241
- Gary, now!
- [quacking]

1191
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:20,713
Ah!

1192
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:29,550
Couldn't let you
have all the fun.

1193
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,501
So l guess you'll be
taking off now, huh?

1194
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:47,269
Seeing as there's no reason
to stick around anymore.

1195
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:50,209
l'm still here,
aren't l?

1196
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:53,279
Yeah.

1197
01:25:55,249 --> 01:25:59,811
- What now?
- l don't know. l'm on dry land.

1198
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,548
True.

1199
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:04,114
Which means you're
the superior officer.

1200
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:06,092
True.

1201
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,060
So you tell me.

1202
01:26:10,898 --> 01:26:11,922
Um...

1203
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:17,998
- [clears throat]
- Lulu!

1204
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:20,404
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could l have a few words?

1205
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,238
Sure.

1206
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:24,005
Well, we... l... You know.

1207
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:26,679
Oh.

1208
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,978
We'll talk later.

1209
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:34,920
- Mission accomplished, soldier.
- l suppose it is.

1210
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:39,517
- l guess you'll be leaving us now.
- l guess so.

1211
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:43,530
l want you to have this.

1212
01:26:47,201 --> 01:26:49,726
Because l don't want you
ever to forget me.

1213
01:26:53,207 --> 01:26:55,903
l will never forget you.

1214
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,847
'Cause you're the
best friend l ever had.

1215
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:04,316
No matter how far...

1216
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:07,183
...or long life takes me away,

1217
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:10,156
l will always be thinking about you.

1218
01:27:12,226 --> 01:27:14,456
l love you, Shane.

1219
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:18,223
l love you too.

1220
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:31,077
From now on, it's your command.

1221
01:27:33,981 --> 01:27:36,040
At ease, soldiers.

1222
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:39,951
[Wolfe] Your father would
be so proud of all of you.

1223
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:44,718
Awww.

1224
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,453
Look who just woke up.

1225
01:27:47,261 --> 01:27:49,286
- [Lulu] Shane?
- Yes?

1226
01:27:49,363 --> 01:27:53,424
- Are we ever gonna see you again?
- What are you talking about?

1227
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:55,992
We still have one more mission.

1228
01:27:56,104 --> 01:28:00,006
# You are 16, going on 1 7

1229
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:03,477
# Baby, it's time to think

1230
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:06,570
# Better beware
Be canny and careful

1231
01:28:06,647 --> 01:28:10,310
# Baby, you're on the brink

1232
01:28:10,384 --> 01:28:13,478
# You are 16, going on 1 7

1233
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:17,285
# Fellows will fall in line

1234
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:20,327
- # Eager young lads
- Yes!

1235
01:28:20,394 --> 01:28:24,421
# Will offer
you food and wine

1236
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:28,367
# Climb every mountain

1237
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:33,772
# Ford every stream

1238
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:37,140
Looks like you have
a hit on your hands.

1239
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:39,338
- You think so?
- Mm-hmm.

1240
01:28:39,413 --> 01:28:43,281
You should take over the drama
department instead of wrestling.

1241
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:47,521
lt's gonna be nice
having you around now.

1242
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:50,113
Now that Murney's found
his true calling.

1243
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:53,183
# Climb every mountain

1244
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:58,198
# Ford every stream

1245
01:28:58,299 --> 01:29:01,860
lt's gonna be my pleasure
serving with you.

1246
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:11,007
# Find your dream #
