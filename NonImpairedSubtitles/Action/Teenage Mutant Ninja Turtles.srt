Twenty years I've studied

There are no fat birds.

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,566
I see you sniffing around the newsroom
for the big stories.

85

But it's also okay
to just give people something

You ever heard the expression,
"Never take candy from a baby"?

It's because even babies love candy!

It's nice. And you're giving people

something they like that's good and nice.

97

"Wow, there's a nice... There's...

98
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,927
"...candy." The point is, I think that

00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,400
And a "thanks" would have been nice.

631
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,125
Maybe one day
you're gonna be thanking me.

632
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,205
So, what do you want with Eric Sacks?

633
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,760
My dad used to work for him.

634
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,966
He's the only person
that's gonna be able

635
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,804
to tell me whether or not I'm crazy.

636
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,126
Crazy about what?

637
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,201
I don't need you to laugh at me also.

638
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,281
Oh, come on, O'Neil.

639
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,889
This is the Fenwick Express,
it's a judgment-free zone.

640
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,246
A cocoon of safety.

641
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,890
Promise?

642
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,321
I'm insulted that
you would suggest otherwise.

643
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,845
(ENGINE STARTING)

644
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,562
Ooh, 11 hours in the Ha'shi.

645
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,325
Are you sure none of you want to tell me

646
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,131
where you were last night?

647
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,804
How you holding up, fellas?

648
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,681
Ah! I ain't breaking
if Donnie ain't breaking.

649
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,365
(WHIMPERING)

650
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,850
Experiencing intense nausea
but not breaking.

651

652
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,767
Guys? I'm in the zone!

653
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,730
There is literally nothing
that could break me right now!

654
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,285
Starting to break.

655
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,807
Of course, you've all tasted
the five-cheese pizza.

656
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,089
But this,

657
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,531
cheesemongers have speculated
of its existence for centuries.

658
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,525
Da Vinci's original masterpiece.

659
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,041
I submit to you...

661
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,764
...the 99-cheese pizza.

662
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,643
Oh!

663
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,768
It's not possible.

664
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,160
Mikey, it's a trap!

665
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,164
A pizza with that variety of cheese
is a culinary impossibility!

666
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,642
- Shall I list the ingredients?
- No.

667
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,165
- Cheddar...
- (STRAINING)

668
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,408
- Provolone...
- Mikey, don't you do it!

669
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,686

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,041
Taleggio...

672
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,764
(SOFTLY) I don't even know what that is.

673
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,644
Mozzarella, of course.

674
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,210
All right, all right, all right!

675
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,408
We left the lair because the Foot
were taking hostages

676
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,766
and we kicked some serious butt,

677
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,490
and there was this girl
named April O'Neil

678
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,641
who took our picture,

679
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,846
(GASPING) but we took care of it.

680
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,410
RAPHAEL: Idiot.

681
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,485
Oh, no, my worst fears
have been realized.

682
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,483
Don't worry about it.
Donnie erased the picture!

683
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,766
We're not in danger.

684
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,368
No. It's April O'Neil who is in danger!

685
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,450
Find the girl. Bring her here.

686
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,971
But, sensei, you said to not go...

687
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Find the girl!

688
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,201
Find the girl.

689
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,851
APRIL: That's what I told Thompson
and she fired me.

690
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,605
So they're aliens?

691
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,123
No, that's stupid.

692
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,850
They're reptiles.

693
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,127
They help people, I guess.

694
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,966
Heroes in the half-shell.

695
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,001
- Okay.
- Come on. It's not that crazy. I...

696
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,810
The animal kingdom is full of...

697
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,689
I used to have a dog
that could moonwalk.

698
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,131
- Thanks for the ride, Vern.
- Yeah. No problem.

699
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,130
- (CAR DOOR CLOSING)
- Nothing better than

700
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,726
dropping off a pretty girl
at a rich guy's house.

701
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,125
(INTERCOM BEEPING)

702
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,642
Hi, it's April O'Neil,
here to see Eric Sacks.

703
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,723
April's arrived early this year.

704
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,211
I'm sorry to barge in on you
like this, Mr. Sacks.

705
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,163
No, no, no. Please, please.

706
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,287
Thank you.

707
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,930
APRIL: I've been working on a story.

708
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,048
And I have this theory that
there are these vigilantes

709
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,009
that are fighting back against the Foot.

710
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,651
I think you and my father
may have created them.

711
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,680
Uh, I'm not sure I...

712
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,683
Can you please tell me
everything that you know

713
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,569
about Project Renaissance?

714
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,801
Hmm.

715
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,760
Well, um, it was a dream.

716
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,964
A dream that died with your father.

717
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,326
What if it isn't dead?

718
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,323
That's impossible.

719
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,562
We lost all our research in the fire,

720
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,564
all our specimens, everything.

721
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,287
I've spent the last 15 years
trying to replicate the results.

722
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,250
You didn't lose everything in the fire.

723
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,801
- This can't be real.
- it is real.

724
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,723
I saw all four of them.

725
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,082
Do you really want to know
about Project Renaissance?

726
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,521
- Yes.
- Come with me.

727
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,770
I was born in Japan,
at a military base in Okinawa.

728
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,842
My father went to Vietnam.

729
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,364
Didn't come back.

730
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,926
I was an outsider in a foreign land.

731
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,481
A freak.

732
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,120
I was a powerless and helpless boy.

733
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,966
Until a local <i>sensei</i>
took me under his wing.

734
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,730
And he saved me.

735
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,246
Taught me lessons that I later
shared with your father.

736
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,931
Ninth-century Japan.

737
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,082
An evil warlord ruled the land.

738
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,210
He poisoned the water supply,
bringing on the dark ages.

739
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,124
Death and disease
and suffering ran rampant.

740
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,884
Not unlike the Foot Clan

741
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,769
and what they'd like to do to our city.

742
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,963
Then one day, a hero arose.

743
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,289
A great alchemist
discovered the antidote

744
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,050
to the warlord's poison.

745
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,804
The cure-all

746
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,123
for his evil.

747
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,130
Your father and I were trying
to recreate that cure-all.

748
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,368
We developed a mutagen

749
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,523
capable of stimulating self-repair

750
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,568
on a cellular level.

751
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,048
What were you going to do with it?

752
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,642
Imagine New York City,

753
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,244
being victim to a chemical attack.

754
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,405
This mutagen would be able
to reverse its effects.

755
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,926
It would save the city,
it would save the people.

756
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,806
Those test subjects, those turtles...

757
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,131
Running in their blood
is the last of this precious mutagen.

758
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,726
And up until a few moments ago,

759
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,369
I thought we failed.

760
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,847
I thought they died in the fire. How...

761
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,120
How could they have lived?

762
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,326
Because I saved them.

763
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,170
Of course you did.

764
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,921
April, the mutagen possesses powers

765
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,208
beyond our wildest hopes.

766
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,681
Whatever resources you need,

767
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,045
I'm here.

768
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,840
Let's work together. We'll find them.

769
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,884
The course of human history
may depend on it.

770
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,885
I'll show you out.

Of course it's her, Donnie.
