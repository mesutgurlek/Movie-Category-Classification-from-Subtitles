1
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:35,165
Are you wasting my time,
Bourdette?

2
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:38,363
Are you wasting my time?

3
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:41,171
If they find out
I'm talking to you, they'll

4
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,072
they'll kill me.

5
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:47,206
Tell me how it works.

6
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:51,373
No, this is...

7
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:53,513
- This is wrong. This is insane.
- Whoa, whoa.

8
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,250
You're doing the right thing

9
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:58,012
the brave thing.
Please sit down.

10
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:07,328
What does the hungry
rabbit jumps mean?

11
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:48,697
Stop!

12
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:48,129
Thank you.

13
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:52,399
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

14
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,272
So where are we five years from now?

15
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:05,911
Right here at the Lafitte Hotel except
we have a babysitter at home.

16
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:07,450
I like that.

17
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:09,651
- Me too.
- A babysitter

18
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:13,487
blond, about 19 Swedish

19
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,526
and he's very handsome.

20
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:17,325
Don't fuck with me.

21
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,332
...plunge to his death today off the roof
of a parking structure on Burgundy Street.

22
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,297
- We're going live to the scene.
- It's where I parked my car.

23
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:27,371
Joining me is Lieutenant Durgan
with the NOPD.

24
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,435
You think we have a murder victim here?

25
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:32,633
I'm not gonna comment at this time
but I will tell you that NOPD

26
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:34,343
is gonna do everything in its power

27
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:36,481
- to get to the bottom of this.
- Yeah, right, another unsolved case.

28
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,709
- I know what's happening.
- It’s New Orleans.

29
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,586
- The city's going in hell.
- Oh, come on, we love New Orleans.

30
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:43,121
Who dat?

31
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:46,923
Well, the city may be going to hell
but we are going dancing.

32
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:48,484
That's right.

33
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:11,475
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

34
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:12,843
How did you two meet?

35
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:15,445
I'll bet it was really juicy and romantic.

36
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:18,721
- No, not really.
- I thought it was.

37
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:19,748
Well...

38
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,219
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop. It’s a "well"?

39
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:27,390
I know it's a "well".

40
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:31,427
Oh, he was sitting with all these kids
like, 1 4-15 year olds.

41
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:34,103
Their first time at Symphony
you could tell.

42
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,599
- And they were actually listening.
- One or two of them.

43
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,404
You know I just thought it was incredible
what he was doing for those kids.

44
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,480
Bullshit! Those, no, listen,
those kids were juvenile delinquents.

45
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:44,271
They were supposed to be in detention

46
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:46,916
and Will was supposed
to supervise but instead

47
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:49,479
this son of a bitch uses his own
hard-earned cash

48
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:50,847
to take them to a concert.

49
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,323
- They are my students.
- Of course, you do.

50
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,425
Some bad ass kids.

51
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:03,625
Oh, it's not "Ow!". It’s Aaaw!

52
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:34,460
- What? ...What?
- Close your eyes.

53
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:35,992
Where are you going?

54
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:37,363
Don't look at me.

55
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,366
- Come back.
- Close your eyes.

56
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,432
Close your eyes.
Tight.

57
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,933
Okay.

58
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,340
Put out your hands.

59
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:50,037
What are you going to do?

60
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:52,039
Unspeakable things.

61
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:55,052
Happy anniversary.

62
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,015
Oh...

63
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,094
It’s beautiful.

64
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,860
I didn't think
you've gotten me anything.

65
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,365
Of course, I got you something.

66
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,296
They're little rubies.

67
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:19,944
Thank you.

68
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:21,735
I love you.

69
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:31,314
One at a time, please.
One at a time.

70
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,824
Phone, beepers, knives, guns.
If it rings hand it.

71
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:37,289
Hand over the phone, Edwin.

72
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,860
- What phone? I'm clean.
- And the beeping is...?

73
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,466
- Thank you. Mr. Will.
- Mr. Jimmy.

74
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,301
- Hey, are we still on for tonight?
- You're going down.

75
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,562
Keep dreaming.

76
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:48,766
Remember if your phone to school,
your parents...

77
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:52,874
The expense of spirit in a waste
of shame is lust in action.

78
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:55,409
And till action, lust is perjured

79
00:06:55,781 --> 00:07:00,684
murderous, bloody, full of blame
savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust.

80
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:05,115
You see what Shakespeare's doing here?
He's using words to create emotions.

81
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,550
What kind of words are these?

82
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,525
They're violent words.
And why is this important?

83
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:12,462
Because when you feel angry, when you
wanna punch somebody in the face

84
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:14,355
you put it on paper instead.

85
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:18,629
You find words that evoke emotions in you
and you do something positive with it.

86
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:19,969
Edwin.

87
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,134
I could have sworn I saw the principal
take the phone from you this morning.

88
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:26,637
Guess what?

89
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:30,880
If you applied yourself half as much to
class as you do to scamming the school

90
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:32,908
you could accomplish anything.

91
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:06,643
Ready to suffer?

92
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,445
Bring it on.

93
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:34,438
- Thank you.
- I'll see you. / I'll see you.

94
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:36,940
I'm this way.

95
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:38,849
- Goodnight.
- Bye. / Bye.

96
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:21,022
Bitch, huh?

97
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:23,950
Get in!

98
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,207
Really.

99
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:39,269
Check mate and mate, mate.

100
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,212
I didn't see that coming.

101
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:44,711
Yo, your problem,
my man, is you play it too safe.

102
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,849
You gotta take some chances,
you know, play not to lose.

103
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:49,484
Pretty much ensures defeat.

104
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,255
Set 'em up, asshole.

105
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,930
- All right, good play.
- All right.

106
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,028
- Goodnight, Jimmy.
- Goodnight.

107
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:24,689
I'm here to see Laura Gerard.
I'm her husband.

108
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:27,548
Mr. Gerard, if you would follow me.

109
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:30,553
I've been caring for your wife
ever since she came in.

110
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,788
We've be keeping her pretty
sedated on pain medication.

111
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:49,676
She has several deep lacerations,
internal bleeding.

112
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:51,911
We're keeping a close watch on her.

113
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,444
Lieutenant Richards, NOPD.

114
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:58,481
She gave us description.

115
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:01,487
We're working up a composite likeness.
We're gonna get there.

116
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:08,263
Could you all give me a moment
with my wife? Please?

117
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,355
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:37,519
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,765
I wanted to her to come out with us.

120
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,456
Hey, Will.

121
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:50,439
I'm so sorry.

122
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,838
The son of the bitch
who did this to Laura

123
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:56,878
they're gonna find him.

124
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,509
Go home, Jimmy. It’s late.

125
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:04,815
- I'll be all right.
- Anything you need, man, okay?

126
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,620
- Anything. You just call me.
- Thanks.

127
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:21,231
Close your own eyes. Tight.

128
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:25,441
Thank you.

129
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:11,454
I'm sorry to hear about your wife.

130
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,018
Sounds terrible.

131
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,121
Laura, right?
Is she okay?

132
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,961
- Are you with the police?
- No.

133
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:22,330
No, but I, um...

134
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:26,695
...a couple of years ago,
I experienced something similar.

135
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:29,001
So it's probably
what you're going through right now.

136
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:31,606
- You did?
- Yeah.

137
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:35,479
The man who raped your wife,
he was, uh...

138
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,471
he was paroled three weeks ago.

139
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,184
You know who did this?

140
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:43,453
He's done it before, he'll do it again.

141
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,486
If you want...

142
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,359
we can take care of him for you.

143
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:53,358
Take care of who?
What do you mean arrest him?

144
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:56,733
Uh, well, if we hand him
over to the police

145
00:13:57,202 --> 00:14:00,433
it'll take at least six months
for DNA tests to be completed.

146
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,898
Ultimately there would be a trial
which your wife

147
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:04,999
assuming she didn't drop
the charges would be...

148
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,437
...dragged through
this nightmare over and over.

149
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,273
She'll be in court.
She'll be questioned by the lawyers.

150
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:15,082
And even if the DA gets a conviction
which is not guaranteed

151
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,484
the rapist can serve
as little as 11 months

152
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,322
you know which is half the time
you get for tax evasion.

153
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:25,121
Who are you?

154
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:28,060
I'm Simon.

155
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,163
I represent an organization that, uh...

156
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:33,296
that deals with people.

157
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,004
Like the man that raped your wife

158
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:39,204
we would very much like
to take care of him for you.

159
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:44,411
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

160
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,480
You know what I'm talking about.

161
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,318
This wouldn't cost you
anything financially.

162
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,922
I mean if you did want us
to deal with this, uh

163
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:57,225
we may ask a favor of you
at some point in the future.

164
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,460
Look after somebody
for a couple of hours

165
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:01,929
or break a security camera,
make a phone call or just

166
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,224
something that would help us out.

167
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,736
You...

168
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,401
...you know where he is?

169
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:18,011
We do but we have a time issue
so, uh, we would have to...

170
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,317
get an answer from you pretty quickly.

171
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:26,416
Listen.

172
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:31,358
We're just a few citizens
who are seeking justice.

173
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:36,000
You know we love the city.
We're tired of watching it go to hell.

174
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:42,496
No.

175
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:45,533
No.

176
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,780
Okay. That's okay.
You take care.

177
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:05,120
Wait.

178
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:25,640
There's a row of vending machines
in the Oncology Department cafeteria.

179
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:29,645
If you want this to happen,
select the Forever Bar.

180
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:35,018
Buy two of them, okay?
Two of them.

181
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,788
And, Mr. Gerard, we never spoke.

182
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:40,790
You never met me. Okay?

183
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:43,962
You do not repeat
this conversation to anybody.

184
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:01,897
- So, you got the healthy ones, huh?
- Excuse me?

185
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:03,770
I just figured
if you're going to have a treat

186
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,942
you should have
something that's worth it, huh?

187
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,179
Hey. Cool, man.

188
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:56,651
It’s all right.

189
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:58,086
What the fuck...?

190
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,488
What do you want?

191
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,751
You raped a woman tonight.

192
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:05,991
Your wife?

193
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:09,930
I have no wife.
I don't know who she is.

194
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:14,236
My wife was murdered three months ago
by some scumbag just like you.

195
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:17,770
Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:48,835
Kirksey Funeral Homes.

197
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:51,168
The hungry rabbit jumps.

198
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:52,340
Mr. Gerard?

199
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:55,637
- Mr. Gerard?
- Yes.

200
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,507
We need you to sign a few more
insurance forms, please.

201
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:26,807
I talked to the police this morning.

202
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:30,747
They found the rapist.

203
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,685
He's dead.

204
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:40,824
Committed suicide.

205
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,310
We'll find a way to get over this

206
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:40,449
...together.

207
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,647
I know.

208
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:46,419
- I'm sorry.
- No.

209
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,616
Don't say that.

210
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,325
It’s just hard.

211
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:57,957
Sweetheart, that man is gone.

212
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:04,805
- I want a new lock on the door.
- Okay.

213
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:06,541
And bars on the windows.

214
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:36,965
Will?

215
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:38,638
Yeah, just me.

216
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:41,135
- Did you lock the door?
- Doors locked.

217
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,044
I sound like a crazy person.

218
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,651
No, you sound like a person
who's getting over something difficult.

219
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:58,585
I wanna buy a gun.

220
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:05,333
We're not keeping a gun in this house.
No guns.

221
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:13,840
All right. If your stance is not stable
you're not gonna be stable.

222
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:17,447
Remember feet shoulder-width apart
knees slightly bent.

223
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:19,646
Lean forward at the waist.

224
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:21,379
Bring the gun to your eyesight.

225
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,287
You got that front sight, rear sight.

226
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:26,146
Squeeze the trigger.

227
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,490
There's your pepper spray.

228
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,922
Remember, squeeze the trigger.

229
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:34,930
- Take care.
- Thanks.

230
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,467
Oh, on you I missed.

231
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,166
- Well, you still have to make it.
- All right,

232
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,507
- side pocket.
- Oh, no. A lot of green, Laura.

233
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:44,969
A lot of green.

234
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:50,607
- Oh, good game, honey.
- You're a pool shark.

235
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:52,573
You noticed.

236
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:55,078
All right, let's go again.
I'll give you a chance to even the score.

237
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:58,718
- All right, I'll rack 'em, you grab drinks.
- Fine. Good idea.

238
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:09,590
Hello?

239
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:12,696
Will? Come outside.
I need to talk to you.

240
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,561
- Who is this?
- It’s Simon. I have to talk to you.

241
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:17,165
Come outside.

242
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,443
Just tell Laura, it's your sister.

243
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,778
- Hello?
- You see the store on the corner?

244
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:29,110
- Yes.
- Go in there.

245
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:36,819
Now I want you to buy a pack of gum

246
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,460
then come out the back entrance.

247
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:42,555
- Have any gum?
- Yes.

248
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,558
- How much is it?
- Dollar fifty.

249
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,700
- Is that the back entrance?
- Yeah, through that.

250
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,547
- Hey, Will, come on in.
- What do you want?

251
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,715
Just a quick talk.
Relax. You're looking good.

252
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,753
So is your wife. I'm glad to
see you guys are back on track.

253
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:13,552
What do you want to talk about?

254
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:15,724
What do you think?

255
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:26,604
There is a, uh, mailbox
at the entrance of the zoo.

256
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,337
And we would like you
to go there tomorrow after work

257
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,448
and mail this at exactly 4:15.

258
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,986
What is it?

259
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:38,845
It’s a letter to Santa Claus.

260
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:41,015
Santa Claus?

261
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:45,391
- And then I'm even?
- Well, that's not up to me.

262
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,262
Well, who's it up to?

263
00:27:47,598 --> 00:27:51,329
All I know is I need you to mail that

264
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:03,746
Where did you go?

265
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:07,384
Well, my sister called. It was too noisy
in here so I had to step outside.

266
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,511
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

267
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:13,421
- Fine.
- Play again? Double or nothing?

268
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:15,486
No. I'm real tired. Let's go.

269
00:28:16,393 --> 00:28:17,690
- Okay?
- Okay.

270
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:22,616
Yes?

271
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,952
- You're in the mailbox?
- I am.

272
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:26,759
Open the letter.

273
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:29,598
Okay. Hold on.

274
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:42,638
- Okay.
- Go to the zoo.

275
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,206
Pay for the ticket with cash
and wait by the entrance.

276
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,440
If the woman and the girls show up,

277
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:52,821
you follow them. If that man appears,
and say, "The hungry rabbit jumps."

278
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:55,882
- You got it?
- The hungry rabbit jumps.

279
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,720
That's right.

280
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:00,924
- What does it mean?
- It means what it means.

281
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:03,995
Now, memorize the number
and their pictures

282
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,360
and tear up that sheet
until it's confetti.

283
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:08,830
You got it?

284
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,901
Okay, good luck.

285
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:39,834
I wanna welcome you to the zoo
and to our elephant show.

286
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:43,803
We have two elephants here
in the Audobon Zoo both Asian females.

287
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:45,366
This is Jean.

288
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:47,433
She is 36 years old

289
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:50,141
and she weighs 7600 pounds.

290
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:55,384
Anya is 45
and she's 10,400 pounds.

291
00:30:56,553 --> 00:30:57,520
What we're gonna show you today
are a few behaviors

292
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:59,345
that the elephants know

293
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,952
and things that we need
to do daily to take a look at 'em

294
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:04,417
to make sure they're healthy
and doing well.

295
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:25,607
What you're looking at?
I've seen bitch.

296
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:28,113
All right! All right.
Nobody's looking at anybody.

297
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:30,376
- Settle down. Come on.
- Don't touch me.

298
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:32,488
I'm not touching you, I'm guiding you.

299
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,415
All right. We need everybody to...

300
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,594
- Hey, Will.
- You came into my classroom?

301
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:50,429
- Why? I don't get this.
- No need to shout, Will. I'm right here.

302
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,200
I've done everything you asked

303
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,447
- the Santa Claus letter, the zoo...
- The man didn't show up?

304
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:01,183
No, I don't think so but,
look, I'm finished.

305
00:32:01,418 --> 00:32:03,682
Will, you've been very helpful
and we appreciate it.

306
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:05,353
But what you've done
is only part of it, okay?

307
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,354
- We just need you to do one more thing.
- I think you made a mistake here.

308
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,319
I'm not cut out to the kind of activity.

309
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,186
- Yeah?
- I hope you're right.

310
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:16,560
Will, a promise is a promise, okay?
I'll be in touch.

311
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:27,404
- Oh.
- Excuse me. Hey, now, my bad, brother.

312
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,136
- It’s all right.
- Oh.

313
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:31,744
- You dropped something.
- No, it's not mine.

314
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:33,446
Oh, sure it is.

315
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:36,884
Hey, this isn't mine.

316
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:15,415
- Will?
- Yeah?

317
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:18,723
We finished rehearsal early today.
You wanna go out for dinner?

318
00:33:20,397 --> 00:33:21,455
Uh, sure.

319
00:33:25,702 --> 00:33:28,296
- Hello.
- I assume you got the package.

320
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:30,495
Yes.

321
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:34,005
Okay, tomorrow morning
you'll have an issue with your car

322
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:37,445
and take the Number 7
Broad Street bus to school

323
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:40,308
get off at the Earhart Boulevard stop.

324
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,383
You'll see a pedestrian ramp that
goes down to the ground level.

325
00:33:43,553 --> 00:33:46,488
Walczak takes the bus to work.
He arrives about 8:15.

326
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:48,222
Wait for him on the ramp.

327
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:49,547
As he passes

328
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:52,520
you're gonna bump him and knock him
over the edge. It'll be easy.

329
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,330
There's a low rail.
It’s gonna look like a suicide.

330
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:57,964
Now, there's two security cameras
that cover that spot.

331
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,431
But don't worry about them,
they're both disabled.

332
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,802
- When it's done, you call me.
- No, I am done.

333
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:06,834
- Will...
- I followed that woman, those girls.

334
00:34:07,477 --> 00:34:08,341
I'm done.

335
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:11,139
...all you have to say is
"the hungry rabbit jumps."

336
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:14,073
You got it?
The hungry rabbit jumps.

337
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:20,518
- What are you doing out here?
- I can't get reception inside.

338
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:49,507
What is it?

339
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:53,546
Does it have something to do with me?

340
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:56,422
I read that sometimes

341
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,989
the partner of the victim
has trouble readjusting.

342
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:03,130
Oh, God, no, no.
We're fine.

343
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,401
Then what is it?

344
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:12,664
- Will, whatever it is, you can tell me.
- It’s nothing. I love you.

345
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:36,065
So take the Number 7
Broad Street bus to school

346
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:37,798
get off at the Earhart Boulevard.

347
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:40,567
Walczak takes the bus to work.
He arrives about 8:15.

348
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:43,032
You'll see a pedestrian ramp
that goes down to the ground level.

349
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,466
It’ll be easy. There's a low rail.
It’s gonna look like a suicide.

350
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:35,686
- Hey, you're late.
- I'm sorry.

351
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:37,485
But you're never late.

352
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:39,385
Okay, I get it.

353
00:36:39,596 --> 00:36:41,655
How many times
do you want me to apologize?

354
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:47,364
And I wished that I had died

355
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:51,007
and far into the night
he crooned that tune.

356
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,135
The stars went out
and so did the moon.

357
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:57,937
The singer stopped playing
and went to bed

358
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:02,379
while the weary blues echoed
through his head.

359
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:05,316
He slept like a rock

360
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,680
or man that's dead.

361
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,367
What happened?
You backed out?

362
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:27,340
I told you I couldn't do it.

363
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:29,235
Will, you know
what a child pornographer does.

364
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,243
He arranges for adult men to
have sex with children in videotapes it.

365
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:33,916
I get it. He's the scum of the earth.

366
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,283
Needs to get what's coming to him.

367
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,249
But I'm not the guy to do it.
I am not a killer.

368
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:41,686
- Will, let's not forget what we did for you.
- I wasn't myself that night.

369
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,219
Nobody said anything in the agreement
about killing anybody.

370
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:47,459
So get the hell out of my life.

371
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:12,121
Why would someone slash our tires?

372
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:16,353
But how did they even get
into the garage area?

373
00:38:16,593 --> 00:38:18,356
It wouldn't be all that difficult.

374
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:23,130
What's the matter?

375
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:24,599
Nothing.

376
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:27,402
But why are you acting so weird?

377
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:30,369
- Why does somehow...
- Will?

378
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,974
Will Gerard?
I thought it was you.

379
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:35,645
Simon Adams.
We taught over Bartram together.

380
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:38,244
- Remember?
- Right.

381
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,918
- Hey, Simon.
- Laura, Will's wife.

382
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:44,383
So how's it going?
Still fighting a good fight?

383
00:38:44,754 --> 00:38:46,745
- Yeah.
- Good.

384
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:50,921
I got out. I moved to Seattle.
I'm just back consoling a friend. His, uh...

385
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:53,123
his wife got murdered.

386
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:58,456
- Oh, my god, that's awful.
- Yeah. Unbelievable. Really, uh,

387
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:00,568
it really shouldn't have happened.

388
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,769
Well, would you like to join us,
Simon, have a drink?

389
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:07,334
Sure, just for a moment.
I, uh,

390
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:09,409
I don't wanna intrude.

391
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:14,181
- Don't tell me you're a teacher too, Laura?
- I'm a musician.

392
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:16,917
- Nice. Love to hear you play.
- Simon.

393
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:22,354
Not to be rude but Laura and I were
actually having a private meal together.

394
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:25,888
Of course.
Yeah, I understand.

395
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:27,556
Nice to meet Laura.

396
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:32,433
It’s funny how people come in
and out of each others' lives.

397
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:34,695
Don't you think?

398
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,503
Call me, Will.

399
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:38,441
Take care, guys.

400
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,115
It’s terrible about his friend's
about his friend's wife being murdered.

401
00:40:58,021 --> 00:40:59,352
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,687
Did you see my work bag?

403
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:03,357
It’s right there.

404
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:17,840
Honey, I think I left something in the car.
I'll be back right back.

405
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:19,365
Okay.

406
00:41:47,637 --> 00:41:49,036
Kirksey Funeral Home.

407
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:51,769
Hello? Kirksey Funeral Home.

408
00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:58,946
- I want to talk to Simon.
- Is this Mr. Gerard?

409
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,441
- Yes.
- Mr. Gerard,

410
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:04,787
I know that it's
a very tough time for you...

411
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:06,454
- but we here at Kirksey Funeral Home...
- No, no, no.

412
00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:10,353
-...want to make...
- Tell Simon to leave my wife the fuck alone.

413
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:13,524
Hey, man, do you realize somebody
slashed your tires

414
00:42:13,997 --> 00:42:16,329
- on the other side?
- Yeah, I know that. Thank you.

415
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:18,996
Jesus, all right, man. Sorry.

416
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:29,138
- Will?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

417
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:30,604
Yes.

418
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,487
- Where have you been?
- I told you I had to go down to the car.

419
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:43,923
Oh, I thought I heard you
walking around.

420
00:43:05,515 --> 00:43:06,482
What?

421
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:10,375
Nothing. Just watching you.

422
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:27,358
Laura, uh

423
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,304
I love you.

424
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:34,136
- I love you too, honey.
- Okay.

425
00:43:34,544 --> 00:43:35,943
I called the "triple A".
They'll...

426
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:38,444
be here this morning with the tires on.

427
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,628
Mr. Walczak,
I need to speak with you.

428
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:37,728
Stop! Stop! Stop!

429
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:38,926
Stop!

430
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:40,164
Stop!

431
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:41,826
Please, I need a...

432
00:45:43,072 --> 00:45:43,970
No!

433
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:48,669
No!

434
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,475
Hi. I'm gonna need your card

435
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,977
and I'm gonna need the locking key
of your wheel nuts.

436
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,249
Do you have it?

437
00:46:31,587 --> 00:46:32,645
Good question.

438
00:46:57,513 --> 00:46:59,140
- Yes?
- Hello, Will.

439
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,047
Just wanted to thank you.

440
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,375
You did a helluva job.
Walczak is dead.

441
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:06,311
And now you're done.
Have a great life.

442
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:12,621
- What's up, punk? Say something.
- Hey.

443
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:14,353
Hey!

444
00:47:15,198 --> 00:47:15,789
Hey!

445
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:17,166
Come on, break it up! Come on.

446
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,161
- Break it up!
- Hands off me, faggot!

447
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:23,171
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get off me, man.

448
00:47:23,506 --> 00:47:24,495
Will, what's...?

449
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:29,070
Striking a student is a minimum
three weeks suspension.

450
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:30,444
Three weeks.

451
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,411
What the hell are you thinking, Will?

452
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,084
You're home early.

453
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:42,023
Yeah, it was, uh

454
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:43,616
half day.

455
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,887
- Student conferences.
- That's funny

456
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:48,590
because Jimmy called me
to check on you.

457
00:47:49,832 --> 00:47:50,799
What'd he say?

458
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:53,331
He said that you hit a student
and got suspended.

459
00:47:53,636 --> 00:47:55,365
Yeah, well that kid is, uh...

460
00:47:55,638 --> 00:47:59,768
- he's just, uh, total mess.
- And that makes it right?

461
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:02,435
Thank you. Thank you, darling,
for your support.

462
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:04,441
- My support?
- Yes, your support.

463
00:48:05,314 --> 00:48:06,406
Here.

464
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:11,486
Where did you get this?

465
00:48:13,422 --> 00:48:14,616
Where did you get it?

466
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:19,523
- I can't tell you that.
- You can't tell me.

467
00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:21,121
I just...

468
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:24,392
I can't. I can't tell you all right?

469
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,766
- It’s not...
- I'm going to rehearsal.

470
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,843
Mahalia Jackson Theater, please.

471
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:45,578
Laura?

472
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,927
Mr. Gerard, I'm Detective Rudeski.
This is Detective Green.

473
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:57,389
Sir, we have a warrant for your arrest
for the murder of Alan Marsh.

474
00:48:57,466 --> 00:48:58,330
Who?

475
00:48:58,601 --> 00:48:59,966
Turn around, please, sir.

476
00:49:02,238 --> 00:49:03,296
Who's Alan Marsh?

477
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:14,380
To the left.

478
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:22,023
Hand over your cellphone, please.

479
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,719
You're gonna hold this here.
Stand up straight.

480
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:26,892
- Go ahead.
- No, it's preposterous.

481
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,960
I'm a school teacher.
I teach English at Rampart High.

482
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:32,524
I am not a murderer.

483
00:49:34,437 --> 00:49:36,769
- How do you know Alan Marsh?
- I don't.

484
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,471
I want you to talks
a look at something.

485
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,345
That's you, right, Mr. Gerard?

486
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:51,112
Yes.

487
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:54,512
And here comes Alan Marsh.

488
00:49:58,027 --> 00:50:00,996
Now, how do you know Mr. Marsh?

489
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:04,357
- I don't.
- That's you again.

490
00:50:06,435 --> 00:50:09,495
Man, you're clearly distressed.
Right?

491
00:50:10,339 --> 00:50:11,636
What happened down there?

492
00:50:12,508 --> 00:50:15,944
There is another camera
that shows the ramp under the freeway.

493
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:18,442
Good, good because that
all proves I didn't kill him.

494
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:22,642
Unfortunately someone forgot
to put the tape in the machine.

495
00:50:23,419 --> 00:50:24,852
Empty, no tape.

496
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:26,848
What were you doing on that ramp?

497
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:30,491
Yeah, I took the bus to work.

498
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,321
Someone slashed my tires.

499
00:50:33,195 --> 00:50:34,787
You can go and check if you like.

500
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:37,327
Let me show you something else.

501
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:39,396
Alan Marsh's cellphone.

502
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,543
Now what were you doing there
at the zoo?

503
00:50:58,354 --> 00:51:00,345
I never saw that man

504
00:51:01,357 --> 00:51:02,915
until the day he died.

505
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:04,549
I swear it.

506
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,452
Is he gonna write
something bad about you?

507
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:11,797
- What do you mean?
- Investigative journalists like to pry.

508
00:51:14,837 --> 00:51:16,304
He is a journalist?

509
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,432
Look

510
00:51:20,476 --> 00:51:22,671
why don't you walk us through
what happened?

511
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:28,515
Will, here's the thing.

512
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:32,046
You tell us the truth.
We can help each other.

513
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:35,615
I want a lawyer.

514
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:50,898
Will Gerard, no priors

515
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:53,099
teaches high school English.

516
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:54,808
Married, no kids.

517
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:58,236
Well, only, I guess,
semi-interesting thing...

518
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:01,448
is his wife, Laura Gerard,
was raped in September.

519
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:04,652
- Why would he wanna kill Marsh?
- Uh, we're getting there, right?

520
00:52:05,154 --> 00:52:06,746
You got anything connected
with him and victim?

521
00:52:07,156 --> 00:52:09,488
- Yeah.
- Video of Gerard on the Marsh's phone.

522
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,624
It looks like Marsh
has been following him.

523
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:14,660
Let me have a go at him.

524
00:52:15,197 --> 00:52:16,164
You give us an hour?

525
00:52:16,432 --> 00:52:19,367
- He'll break soon, boss.
- I said I wanna go at him.

526
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:22,369
You got 23 unsolveds up
there on the board.

527
00:52:22,505 --> 00:52:23,403
Work those.

528
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:27,474
- Twenty two actually.
- Well, look again, it's 23.

529
00:52:32,581 --> 00:52:36,449
Good afternoon, Mr. Gerard.
I'm Lieutenant Durgan.

530
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:43,155
Let me ask you a few simple questions,
just procedure. Nothing to worry about.

531
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,291
I wanna lawyer.

532
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,959
The day after Monday is...?

533
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:56,027
I want a lawyer.

534
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:59,603
You haven't been charged
with anything, Mr. Gerard.

535
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,340
The day after Monday is...?

536
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:03,844
Tuesday.

537
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:06,347
My favorite color is...?

538
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:08,114
What the hell is this?

539
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:10,382
My favorite color is...?

540
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,511
My favorite color?
Uh, purple.

541
00:53:14,423 --> 00:53:15,412
Purple.

542
00:53:16,225 --> 00:53:19,319
If a baby is unhappy, he...?

543
00:53:20,596 --> 00:53:21,654
He cries.

544
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:23,765
The hungry rabbit?

545
00:53:30,706 --> 00:53:31,798
Jumps.

546
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:34,341
The hungry rabbit jumps.

547
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:37,409
Got it.

548
00:53:46,155 --> 00:53:47,122
Get up.

549
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:50,422
Put that on.
I'm gonna leave the room.

550
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:52,957
Wait 10 seconds
and get the fuck outta here.

551
00:53:53,596 --> 00:53:54,528
And then what?

552
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,264
If you don't go now,
you won't make it through the night.

553
00:53:57,633 --> 00:54:00,033
They'll kill you
and make it look like a suicide.

554
00:54:00,636 --> 00:54:02,035
Shut the door behind you.

555
00:54:36,038 --> 00:54:37,369
Hold on a sec?

556
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:14,798
Afternoon.

557
00:55:28,557 --> 00:55:30,684
Lieutenant,
you move Will Gerard to Holding?

558
00:55:31,827 --> 00:55:35,160
- No, he's still in three.
- I was just there. It’s empty.

559
00:55:36,498 --> 00:55:38,329
- The fuck you're talking about?
- He's not in there.

560
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:40,766
What do you think he's hiding?

561
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:47,106
I don't know.
I've never seen him like that before.

562
00:55:48,677 --> 00:55:49,871
An affair?

563
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:51,468
No.

564
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:55,913
No, it's something worse than that.

565
00:55:56,185 --> 00:55:58,847
Call him. Tell him, you want some answers,
or you're not coming home.

566
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,323
I'll give you some privacy.

567
00:56:14,436 --> 00:56:15,368
Homicide.

568
00:56:18,107 --> 00:56:20,769
- Who is this?
- Ma'am, this is Detective Rudeski.

569
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,040
Is this Will Gerard's wife?

570
00:56:39,228 --> 00:56:41,458
Hey, it's Trudy.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

571
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,063
Trudy, it's Will.

572
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:44,864
I need you to do me a favor.

573
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:48,032
I need you to tell Laura in person,
not on the phone.

574
00:56:49,438 --> 00:56:51,201
Tell her I will try to meet her
at rehearsal tomorrow.

575
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,436
- Leave the corner now.
- Tell her, I'm...

576
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,540
- Leave the corner.
-...I'm okay.

577
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:56,601
All right, come on, buddy.
You're going in.

578
00:56:56,979 --> 00:56:58,344
Just sleep it off tonight.
Let's go.

579
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:01,045
Come on.
get your body bag.

580
00:57:38,587 --> 00:57:41,021
Hey, this is Alan Marsh.
This is my website.

581
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,416
Click around on things you
wanna look at have some fun.

582
00:57:43,959 --> 00:57:47,156
You'll find my very byline
my very second byline.

583
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:03,843
Hey, man.

584
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:07,406
You skipped school.
They can kiss my ass.

585
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:11,251
Damn. You decide.
You decide right there. Yeah.

586
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,319
Now you know vandalizing
the school property is illegal, Edwin.

587
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:22,528
What you're doing here, Mr. G?
I heard you got busted by the cops.

588
00:58:22,998 --> 00:58:25,398
What did you do for,
sucker punching a kid?

589
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:27,165
No.

590
00:58:27,436 --> 00:58:29,700
Murder, first degree.

591
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,865
I'm sorry I hit it you, Edwin.
I really am.

592
00:58:34,209 --> 00:58:36,404
It’s all right.
Maybe I had it coming.

593
00:58:36,678 --> 00:58:38,669
Can you do me a favor, Edwin?

594
00:58:39,381 --> 00:58:40,405
I never saw you, Mr. G.

595
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:42,174
You never saw us.

596
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:43,450
Right.

597
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:52,886
Laura.

598
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:02,328
Will.

599
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,028
What the hell is happening?

600
01:00:15,377 --> 01:00:18,005
What is and you're sure
we can't go to the cops?

601
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:20,845
- We tell them everything.
- Some of them are cops.

602
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:24,384
You can't stay at home.
Go to Lafitte's Hotel,

603
01:00:24,586 --> 01:00:28,113
wait for me there.
Use this call me. The number's in it.

604
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:33,223
Here. It’s all I've got.

605
01:00:34,062 --> 01:00:34,858
Take this.

606
01:00:39,401 --> 01:00:40,333
Where it come from?

607
01:00:41,737 --> 01:00:42,999
I was scared.

608
01:00:43,472 --> 01:00:45,235
I should never have put us in this mess.

609
01:00:45,507 --> 01:00:48,340
If they had asked me that night,
I would have done the same thing.

610
01:00:49,978 --> 01:00:51,468
Will, what are you gonna do?

611
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,543
- Where you're gonna go?
- Cops.

612
01:00:55,317 --> 01:00:57,308
Those were the same guys
that came to our apartment.

613
01:00:57,586 --> 01:00:59,383
You have to go. Go!

614
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:04,618
Mrs. Gerard.

615
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:05,924
What do you want now?

616
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:09,356
A little follow up. Has your husband
tried to contact you, Mrs. Gerard?

617
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:12,130
- No, he has not.
- I find that hard to believe.

618
01:01:12,668 --> 01:01:15,831
- Do you?
- You seemed a little tense.

619
01:01:16,505 --> 01:01:18,803
Yeah, I'm a little tense, Detective.

620
01:01:19,141 --> 01:01:21,268
In my situation, should I be relaxed?

621
01:01:23,345 --> 01:01:24,437
I have rehearsal.

622
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,310
- Marshy!
- Marshy!

623
01:01:27,516 --> 01:01:29,484
- Marshy!
- Marshy!

624
01:01:29,918 --> 01:01:32,443
Nobody takes a story like you.
You were the best.

625
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:37,225
But Jesus, Marshy, you could have picked
a more dignified way to go out.

626
01:01:38,193 --> 01:01:39,888
You escaped from a Chechen jail.

627
01:01:40,228 --> 01:01:41,855
You survived your own divorce,
for crying out loud.

628
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,390
Just barely.

629
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:47,333
And that piece you wrote about
the music industry that was beautiful.

630
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:49,996
Gorgeous story.
Marshy, here's to you.

631
01:01:50,439 --> 01:01:52,304
- You're the real deal.
- Amen, brother.

632
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:53,766
You redheaded, asshole!

633
01:01:54,109 --> 01:01:57,010
- Here, here!
- Here's a little music for Marshy.

634
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:32,643
- We're having a toast to Marshy.
- Marshy!

635
01:02:33,281 --> 01:02:35,306
And to our new best friend
as long as he keeps buying.

636
01:02:35,617 --> 01:02:36,675
- Will.
- Will.

637
01:02:39,554 --> 01:02:43,012
- Marshy was a great guy, huh?
- He was one hell of a journalist.

638
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:46,626
A couple of weeks ago
we had lunch and, uh

639
01:02:47,229 --> 01:02:49,459
- weirdest thing happened.
- What's that, he paid?

640
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,766
No, he, uh, he tells me
about the secret organization. Some...

641
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:58,701
...group that claims to hand out justice

642
01:02:59,107 --> 01:03:01,337
you know,
when the justice system fails and...

643
01:03:01,777 --> 01:03:03,870
- He told you that?
- Oh, it's true.

644
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:06,273
They killed him,
made it look like a suicide.

645
01:03:06,548 --> 01:03:08,243
You better watch your back there, Will.

646
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:11,451
Because anybody associated
with Marshy is a marked man.

647
01:03:11,987 --> 01:03:14,820
- And why do they want him dead?
- Because...

648
01:03:15,557 --> 01:03:17,491
Joe, you tell him.

649
01:03:18,193 --> 01:03:19,956
Because Alan Marsh...

650
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:22,790
was an alien.

651
01:03:23,198 --> 01:03:27,134
He was sent here as a scout
to prepare for the invasion of earth.

652
01:03:27,636 --> 01:03:31,299
So, Will you... you are now obligated
to buy us another round.

653
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:32,405
Absolutely.

654
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,042
Augie!

655
01:03:44,352 --> 01:03:47,150
Don't worry about it, Will. He's been telling
that crazy story to everybody.

656
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:50,483
He went so far as even hiding
his own research.

657
01:03:52,227 --> 01:03:53,489
Where'd he hide it?

658
01:03:54,062 --> 01:03:56,462
Well, that would be the $64-million
question, wouldn't it?

659
01:03:56,832 --> 01:03:57,526
Cheers.

660
01:03:59,434 --> 01:04:00,958
Well, he was obsessed.

661
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:04,371
I mean he said he was about to
make that all stuff public.

662
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:07,407
The truth is, I mean, Alan...

663
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:11,406
- he had some issues.
- Yeah, it got worse.

664
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,408
One of the sources got bumped off.

665
01:04:13,682 --> 01:04:17,049
And after that, I don't know, man.
He just he became like, uh...

666
01:04:17,385 --> 01:04:18,647
- Different man.
- Yeah.

667
01:04:18,987 --> 01:04:22,354
Jumpy, paranoid, lying son of a bitch.

668
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:24,488
Just sort of like you, Will.

669
01:04:25,393 --> 01:04:27,293
So what are you, a cop?

670
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:30,562
Next time you wanna come snooping
around show your badge

671
01:04:31,032 --> 01:04:32,863
and don't pretend to be his friend.

672
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:45,468
Will.

673
01:04:50,185 --> 01:04:51,880
- Stop him!
- Hey, Will!

674
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:54,717
Will, come back. I wanna talk to you.

675
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,085
Go after him. Get in the car.

676
01:05:33,028 --> 01:05:33,960
Go, get him.

677
01:05:39,234 --> 01:05:40,394
He went over himself.

678
01:05:43,872 --> 01:05:45,305
Get down. Get down below.

679
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:48,476
Will?

680
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,274
No need to run, Will.

681
01:05:54,716 --> 01:05:56,843
I have something that
I think you may want.

682
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:04,481
It’s the tape from the security camera.
I just wanna show you.

683
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:07,494
I have it right here.

684
01:06:08,396 --> 01:06:10,057
Why don't you come out?
I'll show it to you.

685
01:06:10,498 --> 01:06:11,465
Come on, Will.

686
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:16,593
Will, come on out.
It’s very clear you didn't kill anybody.

687
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:19,404
I just want to sell it to you.

688
01:06:20,275 --> 01:06:21,367
Will?

689
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:32,175
Hey!

690
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,222
Godammit!

691
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:20,264
Mrs. Gerard...

692
01:07:20,635 --> 01:07:22,500
I'm Detective Sims of the New Orleans
Police Department.

693
01:07:22,704 --> 01:07:24,001
Would you come with me, please?

694
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:25,906
- Now what?
- Your husband, Mrs. Gerard.

695
01:07:26,274 --> 01:07:28,742
We just found out some new information
that indicates he's innocent.

696
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:29,842
You do?

697
01:07:30,111 --> 01:07:32,409
We need your help to get him out
of this mess. Come with me, please.

698
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:33,739
Of course.

699
01:07:54,569 --> 01:07:56,093
So what's this new evidence?

700
01:07:56,938 --> 01:07:59,566
- Excuse me?
- You said there was new evidence.

701
01:08:00,141 --> 01:08:02,405
We'll show you
when we get down the station.

702
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:33,029
Man, mother fucker!

703
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:02,394
The wireless customer
you are calling is not available.

704
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:03,954
Please try again later.

705
01:11:14,969 --> 01:11:15,958
Hey!

706
01:11:16,938 --> 01:11:21,398
In a hyphenated compound situation
do you capitalize the second word?

707
01:11:22,777 --> 01:11:25,746
Only if it's a noun and the words
have equal weight

708
01:11:26,147 --> 01:11:31,380
like, "Homeland Security". If it's a participle
modifying the first word then

709
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:34,947
you better,
uh... you better keep it lower case.

710
01:11:36,424 --> 01:11:40,121
Huh, yeah, it makes sense.
Thanks.

711
01:11:59,514 --> 01:12:03,075
Edmund Burke.
"A philosophical enquiry."

712
01:12:09,057 --> 01:12:12,322
It is not what a lawyer tells me
I may do but what

713
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:16,462
humanity, reason,
and justice tell me I ought to do.

714
01:12:29,911 --> 01:12:33,005
There's a guy in the news room
going through Alan Marsh's desk.

715
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:35,009
I've never seen him before.

716
01:12:35,316 --> 01:12:36,248
Look.

717
01:12:37,018 --> 01:12:39,646
Where'd he go?
I'm telling you he was right there.

718
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:55,461
Eight sixty five, eight sixty five.
Eight sixty five,

719
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:58,521
Here we go 865.
Be right back, sir.

720
01:14:19,554 --> 01:14:22,717
Thank you, sir.
By the way, this is a nice car.

721
01:14:23,157 --> 01:14:24,089
Thank you.

722
01:14:51,552 --> 01:14:53,110
Paris Truck Stop.

723
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:55,421
Paris Truck Stop.

724
01:14:56,023 --> 01:14:58,287
Paris Truck Stop.
Paris Truck Stop.

725
01:14:58,593 --> 01:15:00,686
Twenty one and one Paris Road.

726
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:03,930
All right, let's try that.

727
01:15:27,822 --> 01:15:29,813
I wonder if you could help me.

728
01:15:30,391 --> 01:15:34,088
I worked for the New Orleans Post.
And I'm looking a missing colleague.

729
01:15:34,395 --> 01:15:37,125
I know he would come here
to get gas and supplies.

730
01:15:38,065 --> 01:15:39,555
Do you recognize him?

731
01:15:43,905 --> 01:15:46,840
I've seen him.
He goes fishing on the weekends.

732
01:15:47,275 --> 01:15:49,334
He keeps his boat in one of those
units over there.

733
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:50,935
Which unit?

734
01:15:52,113 --> 01:15:56,447
22, I think it is.
But I haven't seen him in a few days.

735
01:15:56,784 --> 01:15:58,445
The truth is, uh

736
01:15:58,786 --> 01:16:03,348
well, he owes me quite a bit of money.
Is there any way to get in that unit?

737
01:16:04,425 --> 01:16:06,620
Well, uh, no, I don't have the keys.

738
01:16:06,994 --> 01:16:10,054
I mean those storage units
have nothing to do with me.

739
01:16:10,431 --> 01:16:14,800
So there's no other possible way
I can in there and get what's owed me?

740
01:16:17,638 --> 01:16:20,232
Well, it looks like they're made out
of some pretty cheap shit.

741
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:23,035
I saw some guy accidentally
backed into one.

742
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,139
It went right through the door.

743
01:16:25,746 --> 01:16:26,735
Really?

744
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:32,386
- So he went right through it?
- Right through.

745
01:16:33,554 --> 01:16:37,820
I really appreciate your understanding
of my situation.

746
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:41,391
Well, we're all God's children.

747
01:18:09,116 --> 01:18:10,048
Hey, good morning.

748
01:21:45,032 --> 01:21:47,330
You know if they find out
I'm talking to you, they're gonna kill me.

749
01:21:47,501 --> 01:21:49,435
What does the hungry
rabbit jumps mean?

750
01:21:50,838 --> 01:21:52,806
It’s not what a lawyer tells me
I must do

751
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:56,007
but it's what humanity,
reason and justice tell me I ought to do.

752
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,937
Edmund Burke said it.

753
01:21:58,379 --> 01:22:01,473
Hungry-Humanity.
Rabbit-Reason.

754
01:22:01,982 --> 01:22:04,450
Jumps-Justice.
Humanity, reason, justice.

755
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:09,017
Well, it was just supposed to be the worst.
You know rapists, murderers

756
01:22:09,757 --> 01:22:11,520
child molesters. But then...

757
01:22:12,393 --> 01:22:14,953
Simon he started widening the net.

758
01:22:15,229 --> 01:22:17,060
Anybody he designated as
"unworthy of living"

759
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:18,455
Who's Simon?

760
01:22:18,866 --> 01:22:21,130
He runs my cell.
I don't know his real name.

761
01:22:21,468 --> 01:22:25,564
- Tell me about how your cell works.
- Uh, it's just handful of men.

762
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:27,573
Uh, Simon gives us our orders.

763
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:32,471
He gets his from higher up. I mean
the idea is that if complications arise

764
01:22:32,913 --> 01:22:36,076
then the cell can be cut off
without a threat to the organization.

765
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:38,848
We also use people
who have made a deal with us

766
01:22:39,353 --> 01:22:40,445
who owes us a favor.

767
01:22:40,821 --> 01:22:41,913
Hey, look

768
01:22:42,389 --> 01:22:45,017
I got into this because I was sick
of seeing the city rot.

769
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:49,552
I wanted to help. I wanted to
make it a livable place for my family

770
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,327
my two little girls.

771
01:22:53,434 --> 01:22:55,766
Okay? But now it's... it's wrong.

772
01:22:56,303 --> 01:22:58,601
Simon's out of control
and I have no way

773
01:22:59,073 --> 01:23:01,166
for talking anybody higher
in the organization.

774
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:03,740
Oh, god.

775
01:23:03,911 --> 01:23:06,004
- What is it, Mr. Bourdette?
- I can't. This is wrong.

776
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:07,410
Whoa!

777
01:23:07,748 --> 01:23:08,680
Mr. Bourdette?

778
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:17,614
November 3rd, this is Alan Marsh.

779
01:23:57,498 --> 01:24:00,194
Will, Jesus, man,
everybody's looking...

780
01:24:02,369 --> 01:24:05,031
- Christ, what the hell is going on?
- I know, Jimmy.

781
01:24:05,339 --> 01:24:07,398
- What the fuck do you know?
- I saw the pictures.

782
01:24:07,908 --> 01:24:08,966
You and Simon.

783
01:24:09,476 --> 01:24:11,205
- You're part of this.
- Look, okay. Will,

784
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:15,410
okay, listen to me, okay?
I'm a part of the organization, okay?

785
01:24:15,749 --> 01:24:18,081
I joined 15 years ago
when my brother got killed.

786
01:24:18,419 --> 01:24:21,855
They didn't even test the bastard.
I had to do something so I'm sorry.

787
01:24:22,389 --> 01:24:26,325
The fucking scumbag that raped Laura
I wanted him crucified.

788
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,120
Who set me up for the murder
of that reporter, huh?

789
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:31,464
- Was it you, you fuck?
- I called Durgan

790
01:24:31,999 --> 01:24:33,796
told him to let you go.
That was me.

791
01:24:34,635 --> 01:24:36,398
What's Simon's real name?

792
01:24:39,473 --> 01:24:40,906
Will, I can't tell you that.

793
01:24:41,275 --> 01:24:43,743
You have no idea
what this guy is capable of.

794
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:47,212
His name.

795
01:24:48,482 --> 01:24:50,677
- I'm your fucking friend.
- No!

796
01:24:51,618 --> 01:24:54,883
You're Simon's friend.
You tell me his fucking name.

797
01:24:55,289 --> 01:24:56,517
What's his name?

798
01:25:35,796 --> 01:25:37,320
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

799
01:25:37,798 --> 01:25:39,390
- Open the seatbelt.
- Get out of the car!

800
01:25:40,067 --> 01:25:40,965
Okay.

801
01:25:42,636 --> 01:25:43,967
Fuck you pedophile.

802
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:46,097
The hungry rabbit jumps.

803
01:25:46,673 --> 01:25:49,039
- The hungry rabbit jumps.
- The hungry rabbit jumps.

804
01:25:55,716 --> 01:25:57,240
How long have you been following me?

805
01:25:57,718 --> 01:25:58,707
Answer me!

806
01:25:59,353 --> 01:26:02,049
Not long. Just from that house
on Seaborne Street.

807
01:26:02,589 --> 01:26:04,113
I was just told to wait for you there.

808
01:26:04,391 --> 01:26:06,154
And if you turned up
and I was to follow you and...

809
01:26:06,393 --> 01:26:07,724
Why did you agree to kill me?

810
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:09,396
I owed him.

811
01:26:09,863 --> 01:26:11,797
He killed the man
who murdered my sister.

812
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:12,930
Simon?

813
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,766
- What's his mobile number?
- It’s in my cellphone.

814
01:26:16,236 --> 01:26:17,203
Get up.

815
01:26:17,638 --> 01:26:20,436
- Get up!
- Don't kill me, please. Please don't kill...

816
01:26:21,475 --> 01:26:22,635
Get up! Give me the phone.

817
01:26:24,511 --> 01:26:26,411
Get outta here, Go!

818
01:26:56,944 --> 01:26:59,208
What does hungry rabbit jumps mean?

819
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:02,509
"It’s not what a lawyer tells me
I must do..."

820
01:27:05,552 --> 01:27:06,246
Yeah?

821
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,085
Eugene Cook

822
01:27:08,622 --> 01:27:10,817
head of the RJ Allen Group.

823
01:27:11,191 --> 01:27:12,681
- Will?
- You framed me.

824
01:27:13,227 --> 01:27:15,354
You framed me for the murder
of Alan Marsh.

825
01:27:15,796 --> 01:27:17,263
I also know that

826
01:27:17,598 --> 01:27:20,465
you had Bourdette killed.
Watch.

827
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:28,432
The hungry rabbit jumps mean...

828
01:27:29,476 --> 01:27:32,604
"It’s not what a lawyer tells me
I must do but it's what..."

829
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:34,409
And there's more.

830
01:27:34,748 --> 01:27:36,079
Very resourceful.

831
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:38,714
I want the security tape
from the overpass.

832
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:40,780
The one that shows I didn't kill Marsh.

833
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:42,383
So I've got something you want

834
01:27:42,489 --> 01:27:44,320
and now it looks like
you've got something I want.

835
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:45,550
We should trade.

836
01:27:45,993 --> 01:27:47,358
Here's what's going to happen.

837
01:27:48,795 --> 01:27:50,387
You're going to meet me
at the Superdome

838
01:27:50,831 --> 01:27:52,128
five o'clock tonight.

839
01:27:53,634 --> 01:27:54,601
You bring the tape.

840
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:01,696
- Eugene Cook.
- There'll be a prepaid ticket in your name.

841
01:28:02,109 --> 01:28:03,508
Go to your assigned seat

842
01:28:04,478 --> 01:28:06,002
and wait for me there.

843
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:52,721
Hey, Trudy, I need to talk to you.
Can I come in?

844
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:54,353
Yeah, sure.

845
01:28:56,997 --> 01:28:59,761
By hiding out, she is not helping Will.

846
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,598
And she may be charged with aiding
and abetting a fugitive

847
01:29:03,036 --> 01:29:04,162
or even as an accessory to murder.

848
01:29:04,471 --> 01:29:05,699
- Do you...
- I'm sorry, Jimmy. I don't know.

849
01:29:05,906 --> 01:29:07,806
She's not answering her cell.
She's not returning my calls.

850
01:29:08,141 --> 01:29:09,403
You're her best friend, right?

851
01:29:09,476 --> 01:29:12,138
You know her better than
maybe anyone else in the whole world.

852
01:29:12,512 --> 01:29:14,810
If you were in her shoes,
where would you go?

853
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:28,686
Will?

854
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:33,592
- Who is it?
- Laura? Where's Jimmy?

855
01:29:35,869 --> 01:29:36,995
- How did you...?
- Can I come in?

856
01:29:37,337 --> 01:29:38,031
Where's Will?

857
01:29:51,618 --> 01:29:52,482
Will?

858
01:29:54,955 --> 01:29:56,149
I'm here.

859
01:29:57,257 --> 01:29:59,020
- Where are you?
- Get up on your seat

860
01:29:59,226 --> 01:30:00,716
and head towards the concourse.

861
01:30:01,161 --> 01:30:05,359
- What?
- Get up and head toward the concourse.

862
01:30:25,419 --> 01:30:28,183
- Yeah?
- Go out on to the concourse.

863
01:30:28,555 --> 01:30:30,955
You'll see a men's room.
Go in.

864
01:30:41,435 --> 01:30:41,958
Yeah?

865
01:30:42,569 --> 01:30:43,501
Take a leak.

866
01:30:57,584 --> 01:30:59,449
- Yeah?
- Go to the hotdog stand

867
01:30:59,519 --> 01:31:01,578
and buy yourself a hotdog.

868
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:21,107
Having fun?

869
01:31:37,557 --> 01:31:38,319
Look at you

870
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:41,719
- trying not to kill a child pornographer.
- He wasn't a child pornographer.

871
01:31:42,262 --> 01:31:43,524
Oh, but you didn't know that.

872
01:31:44,197 --> 01:31:45,596
You must be a good man, Will.

873
01:31:46,032 --> 01:31:47,329
An endangered species.

874
01:31:47,467 --> 01:31:50,231
- But where is the actual security tape?
- Yeah?

875
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:54,630
Good.
Sent me a picture.

876
01:31:59,746 --> 01:32:01,043
It’s with your wife.

877
01:32:02,716 --> 01:32:05,116
This time Jimmy's done a good job.
Now where's my DVD?

878
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:07,712
I don't have it on me.

879
01:32:08,522 --> 01:32:10,422
I'll tell you where it is
when I get my wife.

880
01:32:16,463 --> 01:32:18,556
Well, she's in the abandoned mall
next door.

881
01:32:19,065 --> 01:32:20,327
Let's go see her.

882
01:32:36,783 --> 01:32:38,717
You believe they
haven't fixed this place up

883
01:32:39,352 --> 01:32:41,252
all these years after the hurricane?

884
01:32:55,435 --> 01:32:56,402
Laura.

885
01:32:57,704 --> 01:32:59,968
Sorry, buddy.
You left me no choice.

886
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:01,406
Let her go.

887
01:33:06,713 --> 01:33:07,645
Did you make copies of this thing?

888
01:33:07,981 --> 01:33:09,414
- No.
- Now that's good.

889
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:12,851
'Cause if you did, I'm gonna fly to Philly
and find your sister and her two little kids

890
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:15,679
- and tell them a really scary bedtime story.
- You have what you want.

891
01:33:16,356 --> 01:33:17,414
Please let her go.

892
01:33:18,959 --> 01:33:21,484
What I do is so important
to jeopardize. I'm sorry.

893
01:33:22,028 --> 01:33:24,258
So you and Laura are not gonna
walk outta here today.

894
01:33:26,299 --> 01:33:27,459
You're insane.

895
01:33:31,538 --> 01:33:32,436
What did you say?

896
01:33:32,873 --> 01:33:35,671
I said I think you're sick.

897
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:39,807
On the contrary, I am very well.

898
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,640
You don't see it, do you?

899
01:33:42,115 --> 01:33:44,913
The city and how close
we are to absolute chaos?

900
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,181
Jimmy sees it.
Don't you, Jimmy?

901
01:33:49,756 --> 01:33:51,223
Sick, I'm not sick.

902
01:33:51,558 --> 01:33:54,220
The sick ones are sitting on their fat,
fucking asses eating and

903
01:33:54,461 --> 01:33:57,055
drinking and fucking themselves
into a stupor.

904
01:33:57,797 --> 01:34:01,255
Polluting the world without a second
thought while it goes down the toilet.

905
01:34:01,501 --> 01:34:03,696
Nobody wants
to do the nasty work, Will.

906
01:34:04,237 --> 01:34:05,499
You know the shit that
we all just think about.

907
01:34:05,705 --> 01:34:07,969
Most good citizens
are just along for the ride

908
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:10,743
and they fucking bitch and moan
and complain about everything

909
01:34:11,111 --> 01:34:12,135
when it doesn't work out.

910
01:34:13,146 --> 01:34:14,443
But not me.

911
01:34:15,115 --> 01:34:16,013
Get it done.

912
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:18,914
Will!

913
01:34:31,464 --> 01:34:32,658
What the fuck, Jimmy?

914
01:34:34,501 --> 01:34:36,366
You promised not to hurt them!

915
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:40,373
We didn't get into this organization
to kill innocent people.

916
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:47,738
Laura, run!

917
01:34:49,716 --> 01:34:50,705
You're happy now?

918
01:35:50,377 --> 01:35:51,344
Will!

919
01:35:52,746 --> 01:35:53,610
Will!

920
01:37:00,513 --> 01:37:02,447
So Jimmy's dead, huh?

921
01:37:02,949 --> 01:37:04,382
Eugene Cook killed him.

922
01:37:12,659 --> 01:37:14,490
Who killed Eugene Cook?

923
01:37:15,562 --> 01:37:16,654
I did.

924
01:37:18,465 --> 01:37:19,727
I don't think so.

925
01:37:22,635 --> 01:37:23,761
Here's what happened.

926
01:37:24,704 --> 01:37:27,969
Eugene Cook
and Jimmy killed each other.

927
01:37:28,742 --> 01:37:30,733
I don't even think you two were here.

928
01:37:34,547 --> 01:37:37,448
Simple case of a dead man
killing a dead man.

929
01:37:39,586 --> 01:37:42,851
You don't suppose I could interest you
in joining our organization.

930
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:45,691
- No.
- You sure?

931
01:37:47,026 --> 01:37:49,551
Well, if you have a change of heart

932
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:51,527
you know where to find me, right?

933
01:37:52,699 --> 01:37:54,929
Now, I think you two better
get the hell outta here.

934
01:37:55,401 --> 01:37:56,368
Lieutenant.

935
01:37:57,904 --> 01:37:59,565
The story you just told us

936
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,832
is that how it's going to be?

937
01:38:03,076 --> 01:38:04,441
This is New Orleans.

938
01:38:05,078 --> 01:38:06,602
Yeah, that's how it's gonna be.

939
01:38:09,849 --> 01:38:10,873
Go on.

940
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:21,324
Breaking news, we're going live
to Catherine James

941
01:38:21,594 --> 01:38:22,526
on the scene.

942
01:38:23,196 --> 01:38:26,461
Detective, the bodies of four males were
found shot in that abandoned mall.

943
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:28,130
Can you tell us what happened?

944
01:38:28,234 --> 01:38:31,169
I'm not gonna comment in the middle
of an ongoing investigation.

945
01:38:31,437 --> 01:38:32,369
But I can tell you

946
01:38:32,438 --> 01:38:35,601
NOPD is gonna do everything
in its power to get to the bottom of it.

947
01:38:35,942 --> 01:38:40,345
In other news, prosecutors have dropped
all charges against school teacher Will Gerard

948
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,974
who was accused of murdering
the New Orleans Post reporter Alan Marsh.

949
01:38:44,584 --> 01:38:46,916
A security tape uncovered by the NOPD

950
01:38:47,353 --> 01:38:50,015
clearly proves that Gerard
did not kill Alan Marsh

951
01:38:50,423 --> 01:38:55,122
and, in fact, was trying to defend himself
when Marsh attacked him on the walkway

952
01:38:55,428 --> 01:38:57,259
under the Broad Street overpass.

953
01:39:27,193 --> 01:39:30,560
This is for you.
It’s Marsh's research. It’s just a start.

954
01:39:32,599 --> 01:39:33,463
Thanks, Will.

955
01:39:33,833 --> 01:39:37,234
He just scratched the surface
and I thought someone should finish it.

956
01:39:38,104 --> 01:39:39,162
I'll give it a look.

957
01:39:40,673 --> 01:39:42,436
The hungry rabbit jumps, eh?
