18

<i>They were given a final physical</i>
<i>examination and pronounced all fit.</i>

19
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,828
<i>The crew then had a breakfast</i>

22

- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Horace.

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,895
Are we late?

28
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:34,522
Traffic was terrible.

29
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:36,482
Well, I see you're all in good spirits.

30
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,520
- Have you done the EDS test yet?
- They're almost completed.

31
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:46,818
- Do you want us to enter?
- In a moment.

32
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:48,120
What's up?

33
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:50,414
I'm not very good at things like this.

34
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:53,238
I've known you, especially
Colonel Brubaker,

35
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:55,194
for some time.

36
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,870
What you're about to do today,
I've spent my life.

37
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:05,550
I'd just like yuh to know that I feel
that all I've ever worked for,

38
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,466
it has meaning today,
and I'm very proud.

39
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:10,305
Proud of the program

40
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,933
and proud of what I've been able to
contribute in some small way, and

41
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,306
proud of you.

42
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:20,066
I'd like for you to take
this Bible with you,

43
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:22,032
from me, from all of us.

44
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,358
Why, Horace, I don't know
what to say.

45
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:27,520
- Well, try saying nothing for a change.
- Horace...

46
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:29,823
thank you.

47
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:32,620
We'd be honored to take this with us.

48
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,117
Well, gentlemen, let's go to Mars.

49
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,692

51
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:45,302

<i>will be flown back to Houston</i>

52

<i>- following launch.</i>
- Good morning, Congressman Peaker.

53
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:50,767
We've reserved three of the best seats
for you and for General Enders,

54
00:03:50,803 --> 00:03:52,012
right next to Vice President.

55
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,233
Is he here yet?

56
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,013
No, sir, he's due any moment.

57
00:03:56,857 --> 00:03:59,811
Asshole probably thinks they'll delay
the launch for him.

58
00:04:00,277 --> 00:04:02,801
Someone should tell him this is not
a bridge opening.

59
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:05,288
I hope you and Mrs. Peaker will be
very comfortable.

60
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:08,328
The Agency would like you to have
these commemorative binoculars

61
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:10,783
to help you watch the launch
and to remember this day.

62
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,623
That's very nice. Look, Emily.

63
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,712
They have the date,
Capricorn One emblem in gold.

64
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:19,003
- Very nice, Hollis.
- I'm glad you like them.

65
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,258
Well, we'll need another pair
for my wife.

66
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,432
I, I beg your pardon, sir?

67
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:24,510
Oh, don't make a fuss, Hollis,
it's all right.

68
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,552
I said, 'we'll need another pair
for my wife.'

69
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,559
- It's really not necessary.
- Here, Emily, take mine.

70
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:31,412
- I really won't need them.
- No, I don't...

71
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,193
Congressman Peaker,
there's only a limited...

72
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,599
I didn't quite hear what you said.
Would you mind repeating it, please?

73
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,354
Oh, there's no problem.
I'll get another pair right away.

74
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,274
Very thoughtful of you.

75
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,579

- Phyllis?
- Hello, Hollis.

86

Emily, glad to see you.
Hollis, how are you?

87

Very well, Mr. Vice President.

88

- How is the President today?
- Oh, just fine, thank you, Hollis.

89
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:38,676
He asked me to personally express
his regrets at being unable to be here.

90
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,184
There were some pressing matters

91
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,223
that needed his attention
in Washington.

92
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,598
Like getting re-elected?

93
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:48,687
Mr. Vice President? I hope you and
Mrs. Price will be very comfortable.

<i>that system is pre-set.</i>

148
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:29,201
Initial stage thruster check is normal.

149
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:32,192
<i>We're coming up on</i>
<i>T-minus 1 min. 30 seconds.</i>

150
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:34,660
<i>The final range safety checks</i>
<i>are completed.</i>

151
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,996
<i>The Launch Safety Officer</i>
<i>reports all systems</i>

152
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,369
<i>are normal and we are Go</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

153
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,871
<i>The launch escape tower is now</i>
<i>fully armed.</i>

154
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,342
<i>In the event of an abort,</i>

155
00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:46,799
<i>the tower will carry the command</i>
<i>module away from the launch vehicle</i>

156
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:50,049
<i>and will activate a system of</i>
<i>control shift at 10.000 feet.</i>

157
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:53,723
<i>The flight crew reports all guidance</i>
<i>and navigation systems</i>

158
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,838
<i>functioning properly.</i>

159
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:58,853
<i>The Range Safety Officer reports</i>
<i>alternating systems are operating.</i>

160
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,514
<i>This is Capricorn Control.</i>

161
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:09,443
It's that big tall white thing over there.

162
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:11,570
You can't miss it.

163
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:18,813
<i>This is Paul Cunningham,</i>
<i>Capricorn Control.</i>

164
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,260
<i>We're at T-minus 1 min.</i>
<i>and still counting.</i>

165
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:23,636
<i>All systems are go.</i>
<i>All lights are green.</i>

166
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:26,923
<i>We should have launch vehicle</i>
<i>power transfer right about now.</i>

167
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:31,723
<i>Roger, Houston, we read</i>
<i>nominal A.L.C.S.</i>

168
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,754
<i>Roger, Captain.</i>

169
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:35,607
<i>We're at T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

170
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:38,847
At the present time, all systems
are go. All lights are green.

171
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:48,455
Gentlemen, we're going to be
a little while.

172
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:51,029
You and your men might be more
comfortable in these.

173
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,084
<i>We're at T-minus 18 seconds.</i>
<i>from lift-off.</i>

174
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:01,955
<i>We're T-minus 15 seconds.</i>

175
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:09,466
<i>T-minus 10 seconds., nine, eight</i>
<i>- we have ignition-</i>

176
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,760
<i>six, five -we have outboard</i>
engines-

177
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:16,318
<i>three -we have inboard engines-</i>
<i>one, zero.</i>

178
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:20,187
<i>We have a launch commit. We have</i>
<i>a lift-off at 35 minutes. after the hour.</i>

179
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:26,400
<i>Roger. We are starting yaw.</i>

180
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:28,999
<i>Roger, roll program complete.</i>

181
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:31,288
<i>Vehicles on targets and running</i>
<i>smoothly.</i>

182
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:32,699
<i>Looking good, Capricorn.</i>

183
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,131
<i>We're coming up on T-plus 40 seconds.</i>

184
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,294
<i>Staging should be in the next</i>
- 30 seconds.

185
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:39,940
<i>Outboard cutoff should be 10 seconds.</i>

186
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:42,550
- Obeco, Capricorn.
<i>- Roger, Houston.</i>

187
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:43,723
<i>Have outboard cutoff.</i>

188
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,681
<i>Obeco at T-plus 2 minutes. 29 seconds.</i>
<i>Going for staging.</i>

189
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:49,223
You are go for staging, Capricorn.

190
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:51,599
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>
<i>Five,</i>

191
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:53,886
<i>four, three,</i>

192
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:56,140
<i>two, one.</i>

193
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:58,269
<i>We reached staging.</i>

194
00:10:58,484 --> 00:10:59,282
We copy.

195
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:04,032
<i>We have separation. Confirmed.</i>
<i>T-plus 2 minutes. 43 seconds.</i>

196
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:06,191
- S-two ignition.
<i>- We have S-two.</i>

197
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,042
<i>We have second stage ignition.</i>

198
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:10,998
<i>S- two ignition at T-plus</i>
<i>- 2 minutes. 46 seconds.</i>

199
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:13,548
<i>The vehicle is 47 miles down range.</i>

200
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:17,250
<i>Altitude: 43 miles.</i>
<i>Velocity: 6.100 miles per hour.</i>

201
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,468
Mr. Vice President, please,
give my regards to the President.

202
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:23,923
Oh, yes, I'll be very happy
to do that, Hollis.

203
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:28,017
I, uh, hope that whatever problems
he found so important

204
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,899
not to be here today,

205
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:31,979
I hope he has considerable success
with them.

206
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,987
Well, that's really very sporting
of you.

207
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:37,689
I'm sure the President will be very
pleased to learn of your support.

208
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:41,698
The President would get considerable
more of my humble support

209
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:45,165
if he would only be a little more
helpful with this program here.

210
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:49,070
Now, Hollis, you know the President
is most interested in this program.

211
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:51,699
I am most interested in a lot of things,

212
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:53,958
including my wife's bridge game.

213
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:56,419
That is not the same as
supporting something.

214
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:02,471
Hollis, there are many people who feel
that we have problems here, on Earth

215
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:03,727
that merit our attention

216
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,098
before we spent billions of dollars
on outer space.

217
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,730
There are a number of people who feel
there are no more pressing problems

218
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,853
than our declining position
in world leadership.

219
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,974
It was wonderful seeing you again,
Hollis.

220
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,727
The pleasure was all mine,
Mr. Vice President.

221
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,123
<i>This is Paul Cunningham,</i>
<i>Capricorn Control.</i>

222
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,326
<i>You're at T-plus 2 hours, 16 minutes,</i>
<i>into the flight.</i>

223
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,020
<i>The spacecraft is now</i>
<i>in elliptical orbit</i>

224
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:30,460
<i>with an apogee of</i>
<i>- 141 nautical miles</i>

225
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:33,093
<i>and a perigee of 122 nautical miles.</i>

226
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:36,508
<i>Mission Control reports full voice</i>
<i>contact with the flight crew.</i>

227
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:38,252
<i>This is Capricorn Control.</i>

228
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,185
Welcome, Colonel.
Would you please come with us?

229
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:44,329
I'm not going anywhere till somebody
tells us what the hell's going on.

230
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:47,799
- Everything will be explained to you.
- Bullshit, I wanna know right now!

231
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:51,232
Colonel, I know this sounds strange,
we are all working for the same thing.

232
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,395
We are not your enemy.

233
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:18,673
Please, wait here.

234
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,561
I suppose you're wondering
why I called you up here.

235
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:47,875
Good morning.

236
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:50,169
Hi there, Dr. Kelloway,
nice to see you.

237
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:52,916
A funny thing happened
on the way to Mars.

238
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:01,384
Well, why don't you all sit down?

239
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:04,517
Well.

240
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:12,483
Okay,

241
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:14,604
here it is.

242
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:19,487
I have to start by saying that
if there was any other way,

243
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:25,166
if there was even a slight chance
of another alternative,

244
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:29,496
I would give anything not to be here
with you now, anything.

245
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,377
Bru, how long have we known
each other?

246
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:38,516
Sixteen years, that's how long,

247
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:40,631
sixteen years.

248
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:44,570
You should have seen yourself then.

249
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:46,848
You seemed walked out
of a Wheaties box.

250
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:50,609
And me, all sweaty palmed and
deadly serious.

251
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:55,744
I told everybody about this dream I had
of conquering the New Frontier

252
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,455
and they all looked at me
like I was nuts.

253
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,115
You looked at me and said, "yes".

254
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:03,210
I remember when you told me
Kay was pregnant.

255
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,002
We even went out and got crocked.

256
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:09,091
I remember when Charles was born.
We went out and got crocked again.

257
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:12,220
The two of us, Captain Terrific
and the Mad Doctor

258
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:14,144
talking about reaching the stars

259
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,431
and the bartender telling us
maybe we'd had enough.

260
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:19,013
Sixteen years.

261
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,144
And then, Armstrong,

262
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:26,897
stepped out on the Moon
and we cried. We were so proud.

263
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:33,285
Willis, you and Walker, you came in
about then, both bright and talented.

264
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:35,459
Looked at me in my
wash and wear shirt,

265
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:38,450
carrying on this hot love affair
with my slide rule

266
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,496
and even you were caught up
in what we'd done.

267
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:48,297
I remember when Glenn made
his first orbit in Mercury.

268
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,011
They put up television sets in
Grand Central Station,

269
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:56,506
and tens of thousands of people
missed their trains to watch.

270
00:15:57,937 --> 00:16:00,807
You know, when Apollo Seventeen
landed on the Moon,

271
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:04,485
people were callin' up the networks
and bitchin'

272
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:07,238
because reruns of I Love Lucy
were cancelled.

273
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:08,829
Reruns, for Chrissake!

274
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:11,097
I can understand if it was
the new Lucy Show.

275
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,328
I mean, what the hell is
a walk on the Moon?

276
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:14,324
But reruns?

277
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:15,778
Oh, Jesus!

278
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:19,085
And then, suddenly,
everybody started talking

279
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,925
about how much everything cost.

280
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:23,833
Was it really worth twenty billion
to go to another planet?

281
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:27,093
What about cancer? What about
the slums? How much does it cost?

282
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,716
How much does any dream cost?
For Chrissake!

283
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:32,302
Since when is there an accountant
for ideas?

284
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:36,808
You know who was
at the launch today?

285
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:38,635
Not the President,

286
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,266
the Vice President, that's who.

287
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:45,066
The Vice President
and his plump wife.

288
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,985
The President was busy.

289
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:52,078
He's not busy.

290
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:54,496
he's just a little bit scared.

291
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,007
He sat there two months ago

292
00:16:58,044 --> 00:17:00,998
and put his feet up on Woodrow
Wilson desk.

293
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:03,089
And he said, "Jim...

294
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:05,379
make it good.

295
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:08,593
Congress is on my back.

296
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:12,476
They're looking for a reason
to cancel the program.

297
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:14,718
We can't afford another screw-up!

298
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:18,856
Make it good!
You have my every good wish."

299
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:23,697
His every good wish. I got his
sanctimonious Vice President,

300
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:24,978
that's what I got!

301
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,783
And so there we are,
after all those hopes

302
00:17:29,954 --> 00:17:31,753
and all that dreaming.

303
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:36,002
He sits there with those flags
behind his chair

304
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,502
and tells we can't afford
a screw-up.

305
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:40,929
And guess what?
We had a screw-up.

306
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:44,798
A first-class, bonafide,
made-in-America screw-up!

307
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:49,308
The nice people from Con-Amalgamate
delivered a life-support system

308
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:52,496
cheap enough so they could make
a profit on the deal.

309
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:55,649
Works out fine for everybody.
Con-Amalgamate makes money,

310
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:57,859
we have our life-support system,

311
00:17:57,896 --> 00:17:59,104
everything is peachy!

312
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:02,759
Except they made a little bit
too much profit.

313
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:06,116
We found out two months ago,
it won't work.

314
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:10,991
You guys would all be dead in three
weeks. It's as simple as that.

315
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,878
So all I have to do is report that
and scrub the mission.

316
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:16,586
Congress has its excuse,

317
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:20,213
the President still has his desk
and we have no more program.

318
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:23,131
What's sixteen years?
An actual drop in the bucket!

319
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:28,685
All right, that's the end of the speech.
Now, we're getting

320
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:30,843
to what they call
the moment of the truth.

321
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:32,600
Come with me,

322
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:35,143
I wanna show you something.

323
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:46,241
<i>Roger, Houston. TMI burn time</i>
<i>will be 5 minutes. 45 seconds.</i>

324
00:18:46,538 --> 00:18:47,948
<i>Roger, Capricorn.</i>

325
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,663
Delta vapor burn time 3.3 seconds.

326
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:58,209
There's a door here. I'm gonna open it
and walk into another area.

327
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:02,417
If you follow me, you'll see a bit more.
I'll answer some questions and...

328
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,586
and we're going to...

329
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,345
Why don't you just follow me?

330
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,670
You don't really think you're gonna
get away with this?

331
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,999
Well, I don't know, it's a chance.

332
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,625
Maybe it's not a very good one,
but it's a chance.

333
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,888
- Who knows about this?
- Almost nobody.

334
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,137
Houston is monitoring the actual flight.

335
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,647
All the telemetry is coming from
the Command Module,

336
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:50,529
so are your voices and medical data.

337
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,520
We recorded everything from
the practice simulations.

338
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,518
They don't know.

339
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:59,951
All we need from you is the actual
television transmissions

340
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:02,822
during the flight and the Mars landing,
that's all.

341
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:05,239
Just the television transmissions.

342
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:06,739
That's all?

343
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:09,207
Just the television transmissions.

344
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,930
We inserted a change in
the onboard computer,

345
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:17,095
so the spacecraft will land
two hundred miles off target

346
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:18,602
when it returns to Earth.

347
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:21,260
You'll be flown to an island
near that point.

348
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:23,816
From there you'll be transferred
to a helicopter.

349
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:28,100
The helicopter will fly you to the space
capsule and you'll be put inside.

350
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:32,904
It'll take the Recovery Forces
a minimum of an hour and a half

351
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,911
to reach the splashdown site.

352
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:37,154
By then, you'll be inside the capsule.

353
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,167
When the prime recovery carrier
arrives,

354
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:44,118
they'll find you inside the capsule
and take you out of the spacecraft.

355
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,037
You've thought of everything.

356
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:49,254
I don't know. I hope so.

357
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:53,837
Of course, you're sure we'll go along,
right?

358
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:56,292
No, I'm not.

359
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,633
What if we say no?

360
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:00,637
I don't know.

361
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:02,848
Don't say no.

362
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,232
When does Allen Funt come running in
and tell us we're on Candid Camera?

363
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:08,656
Jesus! you think I like this?

364
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:11,529
You think I really believe I'm standing
here in this craziness

365
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,954
telling you about patching
and tape recordings

366
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,656
and telemetry and an island two
hundred miles from the target zone?

367
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,408
I don't, I don't know what the hell
I'm doing, either!

368
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:24,574
I just case so Goddamn much,
I think it's worth it.

369
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:27,790
I'm not even sure of that.
I just think it.

370
00:21:28,256 --> 00:21:29,798
I think I'm gonna throw up.

371
00:21:30,675 --> 00:21:32,239
Well, that'll solve everything.

372
00:21:32,276 --> 00:21:33,767
Well, what's this all gonna solve?

373
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:36,129
It'll keep something alive
that shouldn't die!

374
00:21:36,348 --> 00:21:40,216
Before you all begin to moralize,
you take a look around.

375
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:44,305
You look at what we've done and
how much more we can do.

376
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,753
You look at what we've meant
to this country.

377
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,274
Nobody gives a crap about anything
any more.

378
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:54,076
People close their garages,
and triple lock their doors,

379
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,584
they hide under the beds,
they even, they're even afraid

380
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,749
to turn on their television sets
for fear of what they might find out

381
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:00,911
in the evening news.

382
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,368
There's nothing more to believe in.

383
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:06,214
Now, you wanna blow this whole thing
wide open?

384
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:08,254
God knows what it might do
to everybody.

385
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:12,179
I'm sorry. I'm so Goddamn sorry.
I just don't know what else to do.

386
00:22:12,215 --> 00:22:15,595
I'm hanging on by my fingernails,
just like everybody else.

387
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:18,217
Go on, you, you wanna be the ones

388
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:21,771
who give everyone another reason
to give up?

389
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:22,977
Go on!

390
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:27,193
This is really wonderful.

391
00:22:27,988 --> 00:22:29,745
We go along with you

392
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:33,281
and lie our asses off,
and the world of truth and ideals is...

393
00:22:33,577 --> 00:22:34,609
protected.

394
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:37,874
But we don't wanna take part in
some giant ripe-off of yours

395
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,502
and some how or other
we're managing to ruin the country.

396
00:22:40,538 --> 00:22:42,730
You're pretty good, Jim.
I'll give you that.

397
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:44,887
Now, now, now, you're twisting
my words.

398
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:47,675
- Don't sell yourself short!
- Don't sell the program short!

399
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:50,714
Don't oversell it. I'm not so sure
that cancelling a flight

400
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,680
or cutting off appropriations
means America folds up.

401
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:56,936
It's not as simple as that
and you know it!

402
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:58,016
I don't know it.

403
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:01,387
If the only way to keep
something alive

404
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:04,192
is to become everything I hate,

405
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:07,156
I don't know if it's worth
keeping it alive.

406
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:09,694
Please, Bru, don't talk like that.

407
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:13,037
What the hell's the matter with you,
'Please, Bru, don't talk like that?'

408
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:15,873
I don't think this is right!
All the rest is bullshit!

409
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,829
You have to help!

410
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:20,754
- What do you mean I have to?
- You have to help!

411
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:22,428
And what if I don't?

412
00:23:22,464 --> 00:23:25,300
Please, don't put me in a corner.

413
00:23:26,177 --> 00:23:27,457
You're crazy.

414
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:31,975
You know that? You are crazy! You've
got us in the middle of this nuthouse!

415
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,766
and you don't wanna be put
in a corner?

416
00:23:35,395 --> 00:23:36,426
Your families!

417
00:23:38,815 --> 00:23:41,652
- What about our families?
- Please, you have to help!

418
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:44,029
- What about our families?
- You have to help!

419
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,995
Shit, this thing is outta my hands!

420
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:48,284
You think it's all a couple
of looney scientists?

421
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:49,613
It's not! It's bigger!

422
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,600
There are people out there,
forces out there,

423
00:23:53,637 --> 00:23:56,706
who have a lot to lose!
They are grown-ups!

424
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:59,421
It's gotten too big!
It's in the hands of grown-ups!

425
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,594
What about our families?

426
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:04,463
They are flying back from the Cape to
Houston! They are all on the plane!

427
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:06,803
Naw, you're not serious.

428
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:11,393
- Please, Bru, don't make me!
- You son-of-a-bitch, tell me!

429
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:14,596
They're on the plane together!
You want it in writing?

430
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:18,014
There's a device! It's on the plane!

431
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:22,530
There's some people! If I don't give
the 'all clear' signal they'll explode it!

432
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:26,534
Don't you understand?
It doesn't have to be like this!

433
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:27,945
You have to help!

434
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:30,617
It's gotten outta control! It's too big!

435
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,412
You wouldn't.

436
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:37,587
Tell me you wouldn't.

437
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:43,919
I, I can't tell you that, Bru.

438
00:24:52,396 --> 00:24:53,974
This coffee is horrible.

439
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:57,526
- It's not that bad.
- It is. It's that bad.

440
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,023
Don't drink it.

441
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:01,603
I'm always unwrapping things.

442
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:04,951
I wake up and take the cellophane
off the drink glass.

443
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:06,991
The soaps in the Holiday Inn wrapper,

444
00:25:07,204 --> 00:25:11,125
even the toilet has a paper band on it
with a nice little note from the hotel

445
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:14,328
saying they put the band on the toilet
for my protection.

446
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:17,444
I'm afraid that if I stay
in bed too long,

447
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,467
the maid walks in the room
and surround me and

448
00:25:19,504 --> 00:25:21,094
the bread spread with a paper band.

449
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,892
I don't mind.

450
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:24,603
You wait. After a while you won't
know what city you are in.

451
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:28,185
I defy anyone to tell me the difference
between the Holiday Inn in Houston

452
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:31,438
and the Holiday Inn in Cincinnati.
The rooms are the same.

453
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:33,237
The music in the elevators
is the same,

454
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:36,360
even the ladies with too much makeup
in the coffee shop are the same.

455
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:38,822
You never know where you are
until after breakfast,

456
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:41,110
- when you read the paper.
- I don't mind it.

457
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:43,624
Well, I don't mind it that much, either.

458
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,872
It's just that I would like it all to be
with someone I care for,

459
00:25:46,908 --> 00:25:48,546
someone I could share it with.

460
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:51,073
- Bullshit.
- You're so damn cynical.

461
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:54,422
I'm not cynical. It's just that your act
could use a little polish.

462
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,716
- What do you mean by that?
- Liz Haller, for starter.

463
00:25:56,753 --> 00:25:58,792
It was at the California Primary?

464
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:03,140
I believe you used the one about both
witnessing to the unfolding of history.

465
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:05,392
You've got to admit it's better
than soap wrappers.

466
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:07,765
You think all I wanna do is jump you.

467
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:09,099
Yes.

468
00:26:09,438 --> 00:26:11,976
You wouldn't know sincerity
if it ran over you.

469
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,069
- Not if you were driving it.
- I'm glad I'm not like you.

470
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,528
I have better legs.

471
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:18,816
Okay, I give up.

472
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,568
Don't give up so easily,
just change your approach.

473
00:26:23,787 --> 00:26:25,282
What approach would you like?

474
00:26:25,956 --> 00:26:29,252
How about something like, uh,
'I would like to jump you'?

475
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,300
Think that would work?

476
00:26:30,336 --> 00:26:33,339
It has more chance than wanting
to share a life together.

477
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:35,416
- I would like to jump you.
- Go jump yourself.

478
00:26:43,392 --> 00:26:46,310
I'm sorry that you had to wait outside
the house all day like this.

479
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:49,725
There is not much that I can say
except that

480
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,355
I'm very excited
and proud.

481
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,160
Everything seems to be going
smoothly.

482
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:59,361
Dr. Kelloway called to say that Bru
and the crew were in excellent spirits.

483
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,157
How has all this disrupted
your family routine?

484
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,205
- Terrific question.
- Shove it!

485
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,577
Well, the children will continue
to go to school

486
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,586
and we'll try to maintain
a normal existence.

487
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,428
I suppose that's all that I have to say.

488
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:17,977
Thank you all for coming.

489
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:21,014
Uh, I just came out to say hello
and go back inside now.

490
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,053
Thank you. Goodbye.

491
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:44,495
Dr. Bergen?

492
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,338
- Yes, Elliot?
- I wonder if I could talk to you

493
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,963
- for a moment.
- What is it?

494
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:53,098
Well, there's somethin'...
I have a problem, sir.

495
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:55,970
- Oh, are you feeling all right?
- Oh, yes, sir. It's the readout.

496
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:58,354
What about the readout?

497
00:27:58,391 --> 00:28:00,774
Well, I, I just can't figure
something out.

498
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,902
- Well, perhaps I can be of some help.
- Well, I hope so.

499
00:28:03,938 --> 00:28:06,817
See, I ran a check on the transmission,
on my own on the signals.

500
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,323
- On your own?
- Yes, sir.

501
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,659
- I like your dedication.
- The readout...

502
00:28:10,696 --> 00:28:13,824
The television signals are coming in
ahead of the spacecraft signals.

503
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,832
It's like they're closer or something.

504
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:19,289
Oh, that's not possible. There must be
some malfunction in your equipment.

505
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:22,709
Well, I don't think so, Dr. Bergen. You
see, I doubled checked that console.

506
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:25,420
- Which console are you on?
- Thirty-six, sir.

507
00:28:25,457 --> 00:28:26,885
Well, that's the answer.

508
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:29,472
We've been having problems
with the circuitry on thirty-six.

509
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:33,030
We've had trouble with it before.
I'll make sure it's repaired and,

510
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:36,552
thank you for showing me the problem.
You have initiative, I like that.

Hello.

556
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,178
Hello, Mr. Vice President.

557
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:53,349
Yes, it's wonderful, isn't it?

558
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,183
Proud moment for all Americans.

559
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,107
You can tell the President
that's very gracious of him.

Goodbye.

Asshole.

566
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:30,522
Dr., I wonder if I can speak
to you for a moment.

567
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:32,395
Certainly, what seems to be
the problem?

568
00:32:32,565 --> 00:32:34,973
Well, I just can't figure
something out, sir.

569
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:36,314
What is that?

570
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:40,538
Well, I'm not exactly sure,
but it's the readout.

571
00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:44,952
I told Dr. Bergen about it a long time
and he said it was in the console.

572
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,122
I'd like you to take a look at it.

573
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:50,966
- Well, what console are you on?
- Telemetry, sir, thirty-six.

574
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:55,048
Oh, yes, Dr. Bergen told me about that.
We had that console repaired.

575
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:56,722
I know, sir, it's just...

576
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,502
I keep on having the same readouts.

577
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:01,004
Well, what readout?

578
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:05,393
Well, sir, I ran a program on my own
just to check something

579
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:07,302
and the readout is different.

580
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:10,021
You ran your own program?

581
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:12,312
Yes, sir,

582
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:15,022
and...

583
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,071
I don't think it's the console.

584
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:22,161
Well, we'll have it shut down and
I'll see that it's serviced.

585
00:33:22,198 --> 00:33:24,914
Thank you, Elliot, for bringing
the matter to my attention.

586

00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,385
<i>The ladder is steady.</i>
<i>I am three steps from the bottom.</i>

601
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,388
<i>I'm two steps from the bottom.</i>

602
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,691
<i>Houston, I'm on the bottom step.</i>

603
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,858
<i>Houston, I am gonna set foot</i>
<i>on the surface.</i>

604
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:37,946
Ready slow-mo.

605
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:40,156
<i>I take this step</i>

606
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,199
<i>in the journey of peace</i>

607
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,452
<i>for all mankind.</i>

608
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:45,914
Take slow-mo!

609
00:34:51,968 --> 00:34:54,424
<i>Houston, I am on the surface.</i>

610
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:56,678
Roger, Capricorn. We copy.

611
00:34:56,932 --> 00:34:58,723
<i>I am starting to walk now.</i>

612
00:35:00,602 --> 00:35:04,766
<i>Houston, the surface is solid.</i>
<i>Visibility is good.</i>

613
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:06,768
<i>I'm walking toward the camera</i>
<i>now.</i>

614
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,481
<i>The footing is solid.</i>

615
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,197
<i>Surface seems powdery.</i>

616
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,618
<i>I am picking up the camera now.</i>

617
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:19,121
<i>I have the camera.</i>

618
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,240
<i>The picture will get shaky</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

619
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,999
<i>The footing is good.</i>

620
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:31,337
<i>Houston, I am setting</i>
<i>the camera down now.</i>

621
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:34,548
<i>The rocks seem very porous.</i>

622
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:38,223
<i>Houston, I am outside the hatch.</i>

623
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:40,597
<i>Houston, I am on the ladder.</i>

624
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:43,185
Ready slow-mo.

625
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:45,727
<i>Houston, I'm stepping</i>
onto the surface

626
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:46,809
Take slow-mo!

627
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,493
<i>Houston, I am on the surface.</i>

628
00:35:56,205 --> 00:35:58,577
<i>We are going to set the flag</i>
<i>on the surface.</i>

629
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:02,508
<i>We do not claim this planet</i>
<i>in the name of America.</i>

630
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:05,961
<i>We claim it in the name of all the</i>
<i>the people of the planet Earth.</i>

631
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:09,052
<i>We hope that our visit will increase</i>
<i>the understanding</i>

632
00:36:09,089 --> 00:36:10,392
<i>of the human race.</i>

633
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,353
Walker should be activating
the tape soon

634
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:14,512
with the prerecorded message
from the President.

635
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:17,970
<i>Houston, I am starting the tape.</i>

636
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,278
<i>"To the men of Capricorn One.</i>

637
00:36:20,314 --> 00:36:23,066
<i>I bring you greetings</i>
<i>from your fellow Americans</i>

638
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:25,982
<i>and all the citizens of the world."</i>

639
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:28,564
<i>You are so far away.</i>

640
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:32,069
<i>It takes light more than 20 min.</i>
<i>to reach you from here.</i>

641
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,736
<i>One could say not only light,</i>

642
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:37,245
<i>one could say time.</i>

643
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:40,669
<i>You are in another time from us,</i>

644
00:36:41,129 --> 00:36:42,160
<i>the future.</i>

645
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,374
<i>We will never be the same,</i>

646
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:46,515
<i>for this moment</i>

647
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,710
<i>more than any moment</i>
<i>in our history,</i>

648
00:36:49,096 --> 00:36:51,390
<i>has made all of the people</i>
<i>in the world realize</i>

649
00:36:51,427 --> 00:36:53,182
<i>that we are part of the planet,</i>

650
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:55,392
<i>that is part of the system,</i>

651
00:36:56,062 --> 00:36:57,853
<i>that is part of the Universe.</i>

652
00:36:58,857 --> 00:37:01,644
<i>We are a small energetic species,</i>

653
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:06,649
<i>capable of pettiness,</i>
<i>yet capable of brilliance.</i>

654
00:37:07,032 --> 00:37:09,570
<i>We know how bad we can be,</i>

655
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:13,573
<i>now you, the men</i>
<i>of Capricorn One,</i>

656
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:16,912
<i>have shown us how wonderful</i>
<i>we can be</i>

657
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,580
<i>by showing us how high</i>
<i>we can reach.</i>

658
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,794
<i>You have crossed</i>
<i>the last great frontier</i>

659
00:37:25,386 --> 00:37:27,462
<i>and you have shown us</i>
<i>what we are:</i>

660
00:37:27,972 --> 00:37:28,968
<i>people.</i>

661
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,676
<i>Of different colors and religions</i>
<i>and ideologies,</i>

662
00:37:33,227 --> 00:37:35,849
<i>however, a single people.</i>

663
00:37:36,982 --> 00:37:39,140
<i>You are the basic truth in us.</i>

664
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:41,353
<i>You are the reality.</i>

665
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:45,068
<i>We will never let you down</i>

666
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,655
<i>and we will always be grateful."</i>

667
00:37:58,213 --> 00:38:00,846
I have decided after
a careful deliberation

668
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:03,448
and a painful soul-searching
to give you an opportunity

669
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:06,013
- to win your 50 dollars back.
- I don't feel like playing.

670
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,142
- Eight ball, five dollars a game.
- I don't feel like it.

671
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:10,649
- 10 dollars.
- I'm serious.

672
00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:13,521
So am I. I'll even let you break.
Can a person be more serious?

673
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:14,319
You're drunk.

674
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:16,566
I knew there was a reason
I was feeling this good.

675
00:38:16,603 --> 00:38:18,025
I need a drink.

676
00:38:18,277 --> 00:38:21,322
Underneath that wash and wear shirt,
you have some heart.

677
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:23,611
It may be sanforized, but it's a heart.

678
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:26,448
Mike?

679
00:38:38,757 --> 00:38:41,296
- You said I break.
- I musta been drunk.

680
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:50,305
- Hard day at the office, dear?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

681
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:53,941
- Did you break your slide rule?
- I'm not really sure.

682
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:56,031
I ran a check on my own
transmissions signals.

683
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:58,612
The numbers came up screwy,
so I told Dr. Bergen about it.

684
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:00,901
It was like he was pissed at me
for running a check.

685
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,914
He said it must be a console
malfunctioning.

686
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,662
So I told Dr. Kelloway about it
and he said the same thing.

687
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:08,325
Big deal. What did you expect,
a merit badge?

688
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:10,952
I guess so.
They must know what they're doing.

689
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:13,837
Those numbers couldn't have been
right anyway. No way.

690
00:39:13,874 --> 00:39:16,090
If you know the numbers
couldn't have been right,

691
00:39:16,126 --> 00:39:17,335
why are you so upset?

692
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:20,303
It was the way they reacted.
No double check or anything.

693
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:23,135
They looked at me like I was a kid
and offered me a cookie.

694
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:25,932
- What were the numbers?
- I have to admit it is ridiculous.

695
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:27,685
Good, let's play pool.

696
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:36,070
Those signals couldn't have
come from 300 miles.

697
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,233
Which signals?

698
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:39,905
The television transmission.

699
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,620
I think I just sobered up. Would you
tell me what you just told me again?

700
00:39:43,656 --> 00:39:45,494
<i>Hey, Caulfield, telephone.</i>

701
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:53,245
Hello?

702
00:39:54,632 --> 00:39:56,007
yes, this is Caulfield.

703
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:58,006
What?

704
00:39:59,095 --> 00:40:01,269
I'm sorry, you'll have to speak
more clearly.

705
00:40:01,306 --> 00:40:04,473
I think we have a bad connection
or something. I can't hear you.

706
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:06,974
Who?

707
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:10,397
I don't understand what you want.

708
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,242
Look, if you call the assignment desk,

709
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,852
they'll be glad to send someone over
to cover that for you.

710
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:20,070
Yes, ask for the assignment desk.

711
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:22,411
Assignment. That's right.

712
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:24,236
You're welcome.

713
00:40:41,517 --> 00:40:42,715
Anybody hungry?

714
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:44,925
No.

715
00:40:46,605 --> 00:40:49,013
Oh, the marvels of American
science.

716
00:40:50,443 --> 00:40:53,480
Here we are, millions of miles
from the Earth

717
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,362
and we can still send out for a pizza.

718
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:58,868
I'm not gonna do it.

719
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:00,866
Not gonna do what?

720
00:41:01,163 --> 00:41:03,421
Tomorrow, I'm not gonna sit
in this thing

721
00:41:03,457 --> 00:41:06,162
and talk to my wife and tell her
everything is going fine.

722
00:41:06,252 --> 00:41:07,877
I'm not gonna do it.

723
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:11,878
I tried.

724
00:41:13,969 --> 00:41:16,886
I got two little kids with big bright eyes.

725
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:21,176
And I used to tell them their daddy
was gonna make them proud of him

726
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:24,019
like he was of them.

727
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,355
And now I gotta go home,

728
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:29,348
I gotta kiss them and
gotta look in their eyes

729
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:31,813
and tell them I really did this?

730
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,532
I don't know. Maybe that's better that
telling them I really didn't do it.

731
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,079
I wish I knew what was right.
I really don't.

732
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,709
We've been sitting around here for
months, telling their lies for them.

733
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,755
And I don't wanna do it any more.

734
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:55,222
<i>Okay, so we go and blow the whole</i>
<i>thing tomorrow, on national TV,</i>

735
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:56,253
<i>then what have we done?</i>

736
00:41:56,473 --> 00:42:00,057
- We'd screw up a lotta people's dinner.
- We've already screwed ourselves.

737
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:03,153
Okay, so what do we accomplish
by screwing everybody else?

738
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:06,523
He's got a point there, you know.
We went along with this for you.

739
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:08,688
You and our families.

740
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:12,863
Now you wanna go out in
some terrific blaze of glory?

741
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:15,700
And we get pulverized in the process?

742
00:42:18,998 --> 00:42:20,327
And our families?

743
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:27,247
- What about our families?
- I know!

744
00:42:34,557 --> 00:42:35,553
I know.

745
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:37,722
<i>Shit!</i>

746
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:40,980
<i>That's the best thing I've heard</i>
<i>anybody say in three weeks.</i>

747
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,691
<i>- What's the best thing?</i>
<i>- Shit.</i>

748
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,401
<i>I just don't think I can do it.</i>

749
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:45,860
Get me Dr. Kelloway.

750
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:48,656
Why, all of a sudden,
are we standing up for the bad guys

751
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:51,027
and you're on the side
of truth and justice?

752
00:42:51,063 --> 00:42:53,362
We may have a problem with
Brubaker tomorrow.

753
00:42:53,953 --> 00:42:57,038
- I wish I had the words.
- Damn the words, Bru!

754
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,332
These people... they're capable
of anything.

755
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:03,621
And we got our families out there.

756
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:07,090
Now, we're in this thing and I think
we're in too deep to stop now.

757
00:43:07,676 --> 00:43:09,586
No one of us is gonna decide.

758
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,549
It's got to be all of us.

759
00:43:16,686 --> 00:43:19,898
Operator, I'm trying a number now
for over an hour and it's busy.

760
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,389
Would you kindly check to see
if it's out of order?

761
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:25,277
I know you don't do that.

762
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:27,107
Yes, it's an emergency.

763
00:43:28,115 --> 00:43:31,698
Thank you. 8733657.

764
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:35,829
No, 3657, Mr. Elliot Whitter.

765
00:43:42,631 --> 00:43:43,710
Out of order?

766
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:46,044
Thank you very much, operator.

767

773

<i>This is the first time the crew has</i>

Capricorn One, this is Houston.

<i>Houston, do you have a picture?</i>

779
00:44:22,315 --> 00:44:24,015
Roger, Capricorn, we have a picture.

780
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:27,006
We have three anxious ladies here
who would like to talk to you.

781
00:44:27,347 --> 00:44:28,461
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>

782
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,598
<i>We'd sure like to talk to them.</i>

783
00:44:30,725 --> 00:44:33,119
Okay, go ahead, but keep it short.

784
00:44:33,155 --> 00:44:35,512
Remember, this is long distance.

785
00:44:36,315 --> 00:44:37,180
Jack?

786
00:44:38,651 --> 00:44:39,949
Jack, it's Betty.

787
00:44:39,986 --> 00:44:42,856
<i>- Hey, Betty, how are you?</i>
- You look fine.

788
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:47,159
<i>Thanks. You know we can't see you</i>
<i>up here, but you sure sound terrific.</i>

789
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,162
I miss you. So do the kids.

790
00:44:51,915 --> 00:44:54,323
<i>Okay, I miss them too,</i>
<i>more than you all know.</i>

791
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:56,333
Peter?

792
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,495
It's Sharon.

793
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:00,464
<i>I told you never to call me here.</i>

794
00:45:00,925 --> 00:45:02,004
Are you feeling well?

795
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:03,708
<i>I'm feeling very well.</i>

796
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,465
<i>How's Sandy?</i>

797
00:45:05,889 --> 00:45:08,767
Well, she's got the part of Wendy
in her school play.

798
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:10,239
They're doing Peter Pan.

799
00:45:10,276 --> 00:45:11,675
<i>That's terrific.</i>

800
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:13,855
You sound so close.

801
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:17,435
It's hard to believe you really are
that far away in space.

802
00:45:17,693 --> 00:45:19,271
<i>It's hard for me to believe it, too.</i>

803
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,646
Bru?

804
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,771
<i>Hello, Kay.</i>

805
00:45:23,158 --> 00:45:24,652
We're all so proud of you.

806
00:45:25,994 --> 00:45:27,275
Can you hear me, Bru?

807
00:45:28,497 --> 00:45:29,327
<i>Yes.</i>

808
00:45:31,584 --> 00:45:33,991
- I'm not sure of Brubaker.
- Keep watching.

809
00:45:34,337 --> 00:45:37,006
Bru? I have a surprise for you.

810
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:38,087
<i>What?</i>

811
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,586
I said I have a surprise for you.

812
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,129
<i>What is it?</i>

813
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:48,346
Charles wrote a composition in school
and he won an award.

814
00:45:49,061 --> 00:45:50,306
May I read it to you?

815
00:45:53,024 --> 00:45:54,483
Bru, can you hear me?

816
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:55,980
<i>Yes...</i>

817
00:45:57,946 --> 00:45:59,109
<i>please, read it to me.</i>

818
00:45:59,406 --> 00:46:01,482
It doesn't look good.
Do I cut the transmission?

819
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,117
Not until I tell you.

820
00:46:03,452 --> 00:46:07,497
'My father, by Charles Brubaker, Jr.'

821
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,991
'My father is far away from me now.

822
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:14,463
He is flying to Mars.

823
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:16,666
<i>I miss him very much.</i>

824
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:19,465
<i>I always miss him when</i>
<i>he goes away.</i>

825
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:22,090
<i>I'm not sad, though.</i>

826
00:46:22,723 --> 00:46:24,881
<i>I used to be sad when</i>
<i>he went away.</i>

827
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:30,271
One day he told me that people
can't live only for themselves.

828
00:46:31,024 --> 00:46:35,188
He said he was trying to do something
that would be good for everybody.

829
00:46:36,863 --> 00:46:40,280
<i>I know that is what</i>
he is doing now.

830
00:46:41,118 --> 00:46:44,783
<i>He is doing something for</i>
<i>everybody, to give them a better life.</i>

831
00:46:45,998 --> 00:46:48,490
<i>That means he is doing something</i>
<i>for me, too.</i>

832
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,619
So even though he is far away,

833
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,753
he is thinking about me
and I am with him.

834
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,420
That is why I'm not sad.

835
00:46:58,804 --> 00:47:01,093
That is why I'm so proud of my Dad.

836
00:47:01,307 --> 00:47:02,552
I love him so much.'

837
00:47:04,227 --> 00:47:05,057
Kay.

838
00:47:07,647 --> 00:47:08,263
What is it?

839
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,729
There's something I...

840
00:47:12,778 --> 00:47:13,857
I wanna say.

841
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,355
<i>Bru?</i>

842
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:19,738
<i>What is it?</i>

843
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:23,151
Not until I tell you.

844
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:26,916
I know this hasn't been easy
for you and the kids.

845
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:31,541
I want you to know

846
00:47:32,841 --> 00:47:33,920
I love you.

847
00:47:34,635 --> 00:47:38,639
<i>Tell Charles thanks for</i>
<i>the composition, please.</i>

848
00:47:38,676 --> 00:47:39,505
I will.

849
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:41,385
Tell him when I get back,

850
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:46,804
I'm gonna take him to Yosemite again,

851
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,645
like last summer.

852
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,812
I will.

853
00:47:54,198 --> 00:47:56,025
<i>And I want you to know</i>
<i>that I love you.</i>

854
00:47:57,326 --> 00:47:58,441
<i>Very much.</i>

855
00:48:02,165 --> 00:48:03,493
Time's up, gentlemen.

856
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:05,329
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>

857
00:48:05,502 --> 00:48:07,910
The next time we see you,
you'll be on the way home.

858
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:10,460
<i>- Roger.</i>
- Well done, Capricorn.

859
00:48:44,127 --> 00:48:44,993
Yes?

860
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:48,038
Is Whitter in?
Tell him it's Caulfield.

861
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,546
- Who?
- Whitter. Elliot Whitter.

862
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:53,492
There's no one here by that name.

863
00:48:53,528 --> 00:48:55,186
You must have the wrong apartment.

864
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,548
Well, this is apartment 228,
isn't it?

865
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,896
Yeah. Oh, you probably have
the wrong building.

866
00:49:00,932 --> 00:49:02,653
You know, they are all sorta look alike.

867
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:06,308
Yeah, that's right.
This is 4311 Claridge, isn't it?

868
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,909
Yeah, it is.

869
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,943
Elliot Whitter lives at 4311 Claridge,
in apartment 228.

870
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,024
Is this a joke?

871
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:16,418
Look, I've been here a million times.

872
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,946
Elliot's a friend of mine and
he lives in this apartment!

873
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:22,417
Look, Mister..., whoever you are.
I'm cleaning an oven.

874
00:49:22,628 --> 00:49:25,831
It's my oven. It's in my kitchen.
In my apartment.

875
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:28,014
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get back to it.

876
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,679
Wait a minute! Just wait! Look, I'm not
a crazy person and I'm not a mugger!

877
00:49:31,716 --> 00:49:34,659
I'm looking for my friend and he lives
in this apartment! I swear it!

878
00:49:34,695 --> 00:49:37,603
Would you get your foot out of my door
or I'm gonna call the police!

879
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:39,318
Now I don't think this is
funny any more!

880
00:49:39,354 --> 00:49:42,356
Wait. I can prove I've been here before.
I know this apartment.

881
00:50:15,853 --> 00:50:18,770
Now, will you get outta here,
or do I have to call the police?

00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,354
<i>Inboard thrusters.</i>

906
00:53:34,862 --> 00:53:37,151
<i>- Inboard thrusters on.</i>
- How we doin'?

907
00:53:37,365 --> 00:53:39,289
We might have a slight problem, sir.

908
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:41,863
- What is it?
- They're a little bit off target.

909
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:44,075
How far off?

910
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:53,209
- As much as 200 miles.
- That far?

911
00:53:53,924 --> 00:53:57,460
It could take up to 1.30 hour for
the recovery forces to reach them.

912
00:53:58,721 --> 00:54:00,682
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.

913
00:54:00,718 --> 00:54:01,595
Six...

914
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:02,846
five...

915
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:04,933
four...
three...

916
00:54:05,437 --> 00:54:06,303
two...

917
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:12,186
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

918
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,239
Capricorn One, we show red
on the heat shield.

919
00:54:15,276 --> 00:54:16,235
<i>Do you copy?</i>

920
00:54:17,242 --> 00:54:19,040
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

921
00:54:19,077 --> 00:54:21,485
We show red on the heat shield.
Do you read?

922
00:54:21,955 --> 00:54:23,921
<i>Capricorn One, this is Houston.</i>

923
00:54:23,957 --> 00:54:27,544
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
We show red on the heat shield.

924
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:28,873
Do you copy?

925
00:54:30,965 --> 00:54:32,874
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

926
00:54:34,302 --> 00:54:37,588
Capricorn One, we show red on
the heat shield. Do you copy?

927
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:41,550
- Capricorn One...
- That is, Kelloway.

928
00:54:43,353 --> 00:54:45,892
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Do you read?

929
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:51,061
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

930
00:54:52,697 --> 00:54:55,900
Capricorn One, we show red on
the heat shield. Do you copy?

931
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:01,618
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

932
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:05,449
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

933
00:55:06,128 --> 00:55:08,251
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

934
00:55:09,882 --> 00:55:13,086
Capricorn, we show red light on
the heat shield. Do you copy?

935
00:55:15,055 --> 00:55:17,048
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

936
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,524
<i>This is Paul Cunningham,</i>
<i>Capricorn Control.</i>

937
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:22,902
<i>We are advised that there appears</i>
<i>to be a malfunction.</i>

938
00:55:22,938 --> 00:55:25,691
<i>We do not know what the problem</i>
<i>is. We will keep you advised.</i>

939
00:55:25,728 --> 00:55:27,352
<i>This is Capricorn Control.</i>

940
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:29,409
Charles, take Sandy and go inside.

941
00:55:29,445 --> 00:55:31,740
- Mom, what's...
- Charles, go inside now!

942
00:55:31,776 --> 00:55:33,779
- Mom...
- Charles, I said right now!

943
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,158
<i>Capricorn One, this is Houston.</i>

944
00:56:08,655 --> 00:56:11,490
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a brief statement

945
00:56:12,075 --> 00:56:14,199
and then I will answer
your questions.

946
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,906
It must have been re-entry.

947
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:19,950
Something went wrong
during re-entry.

948
00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:22,008
Why haven't they told us anything?

949
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,005
They don't want us to know
what went wrong.

950
00:56:24,042 --> 00:56:25,011
What went wrong?

951
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,417
- Who the hell is Kelloway?
- Where the hell are we?

952
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:35,262
At T-plus 259 days 15 hours, 11 minutes,
in the flight of Capricorn One,

953
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:40,478
which is 2 minutes. 18 seconds.
after interface,

954
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:46,733
the heat shield light on the Mission
Control monitoring panel turned red.

955
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:48,520
We...

956
00:56:50,826 --> 00:56:52,024
are dead.

957
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:54,412
- What?
- We're dead.

958
00:56:54,997 --> 00:56:56,907
Shit, I was such a terrific guy!

959
00:56:57,041 --> 00:57:01,620
We tried to establish radio contract,
contact with the spacecraft

960
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:03,387
an we were unsuccessful.

961
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:06,839
It landed off course.
Why haven't they said anything to us?

962
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:11,094
And if it never landed,
either the heat shield separated

963
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,513
or the chutes never opened.

964
00:57:13,726 --> 00:57:15,220
Either way, we are dead.

965
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:19,441
The heat shield evidently separated
from the Command Module

966
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,959
and, as you know, the heat shield

967
00:57:21,996 --> 00:57:24,441
is the only protection the Module has

968
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:28,819
against the heat build-up on
the re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.

969
00:57:29,535 --> 00:57:34,411
The spacecraft disintegrated within 12
seconds. after the loss of the heat shield.

970
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:37,519
Right now Kelloway is making
a speech

971
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:40,247
about what brave, wonderful guys...

972
00:57:40,797 --> 00:57:41,793
we were.

973
00:57:41,965 --> 00:57:45,216
I cannot adequately describe
how we feel.

974
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:50,049
These men were an integral
of the family...

975
00:57:51,726 --> 00:57:53,055
here in the program.

976
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:56,603
If anybody ever sees us again,
the whole thing falls apart.

977
00:57:56,898 --> 00:57:59,437
It's as simple as that.
They can't have us around.

978
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:01,733
That is the end of my statement.

979
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:08,082
- Have you spoken to the families?
- Yes.

980
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:10,868
I don't know how we have
a lotta choice in this matter.

981
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,618
I say we get the hell outta here.
Anybody disagree?

982
00:58:20,883 --> 00:58:23,457
When was the last time the heat shield
was checked?

983
00:58:25,555 --> 00:58:30,466
All during the re-entry phase there
were a series of status checks.

984
00:58:31,186 --> 00:58:35,350
All of them gave us every indication
the shield was in place.

985
00:58:49,915 --> 00:58:54,162
No, I have not spoken to the President
yet, but I'm sure I will very soon.

986
00:58:54,545 --> 00:58:56,552
I'd like to say that
the President has been

987
00:58:56,589 --> 00:59:01,749
a constant source of encouragement
to all of us in the program.

988
00:59:02,011 --> 00:59:05,961
This mission meant as much
to him as it did to us.

989
00:59:11,438 --> 00:59:14,143
Do you think this will end
the Manned Space Program?

990
00:59:16,026 --> 00:59:16,892
I don't know.

991
00:59:21,532 --> 00:59:25,198
You can't reach that far without
stumbling somewhere along the way.

992
00:59:28,582 --> 00:59:31,334
That doesn't mean that your goal
isn't worthwhile.

993
00:59:33,462 --> 00:59:35,420
So many people have given so much.

994
00:59:36,465 --> 00:59:40,464
In 1967 we had the Apollo One fire.

995
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:49,009
But we didn't just...

996
00:59:50,105 --> 00:59:51,730
give up even though we were crushed.

997
01:00:05,914 --> 01:00:08,240
We went on as they would have
wanted us to.

998
01:00:21,556 --> 01:00:23,981
Now, these three remarkable men

999
01:00:24,017 --> 01:00:27,221
have given their lives in an effort to...

1000
01:00:27,646 --> 01:00:30,102
widen the horizons of their species.

1001
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:48,290
They died striving for a goal.

1002
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:07,642
You tell me.

1003
01:01:10,485 --> 01:01:14,234
I ask you... I ask all of you here.
You be the ones to tell me.

1004
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:17,657
How could we best serve these men?

1005
01:01:19,828 --> 01:01:21,786
<i>By giving up on their dream?</i>

1006
01:01:22,915 --> 01:01:24,493
<i>By saying that</i>

1007
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:27,084
<i>it was all for nothing?</i>

1008
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:33,258
<i>You give me the answer.</i>

1009
01:01:33,885 --> 01:01:37,586
- That was the left gear we lost.
- See if you can retract the other one.

1010
01:01:41,269 --> 01:01:43,308
- Do you have any idea where we are?
- No.

1011
01:01:43,855 --> 01:01:45,266
Which direction are we headed?

1012
01:01:46,024 --> 01:01:48,811
West. Once we hit the coast,
we'll go North.

1013
01:01:49,194 --> 01:01:52,279
All we've got to do is get to any city,
any place there are people,

1014
01:01:53,115 --> 01:01:55,831
a newspaper, a television station.

1015
01:01:55,868 --> 01:01:58,788
Any place we can show up and
be seen. Then it's over.

1016
01:01:58,824 --> 01:02:00,837
I'm not sure it's exactly over.

1017
01:02:00,873 --> 01:02:03,744
Our families, our kids.
They think we're dead.

1018
01:02:04,794 --> 01:02:06,075
I wonder,

1019
01:02:06,463 --> 01:02:09,001
when we show up,
when everybody finds up,

1020
01:02:09,841 --> 01:02:11,550
I wonder if they'll be happy.

1021
01:02:13,012 --> 01:02:15,467
Maybe it'd be better for them
if we were dead.

1022
01:02:20,228 --> 01:02:21,639
Oh, Christ!

1023
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,307
Fuel! There's no Goddamn fuel!

1024
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,986
I told you never to take a trip
without checking the tank.

1025
01:02:28,023 --> 01:02:30,656
- What about the reserve?
- We're on reserve.

1026
01:02:31,866 --> 01:02:32,897
That's great.

1027
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,948
I'll start to circle.
See if you can find a lever area.

1028
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:41,074
There.

1029
01:02:41,459 --> 01:02:43,251
Over there, beyond those cliffs.

1030
01:02:43,879 --> 01:02:45,871
Are you sure you know
how to land this thing?

1031
01:02:47,925 --> 01:02:49,123
Full flaps.

1032
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,697
I think we're on Mars.

1033
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,196
We got about 20 minutes.
head start on them.

1034
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,942
It's not gonna be hard to spot
this plane from the air.

1035
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:54,736
We got two choices,

1036
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:58,168
either we stick together, or we split up
and go in different directions.

1037
01:03:58,205 --> 01:04:00,576
Hey, I just found a survival kit in here.

1038
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:09,554
There's a can of water each.

1039
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:14,060
A flare each.

1040
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:21,027
John, you take the flint.
Peter and I'll split up the matches.

1041
01:04:21,063 --> 01:04:22,525
Anybody want the gun?

1042
01:04:22,562 --> 01:04:23,987
I'd shoot my foot.

1043
01:04:25,156 --> 01:04:26,485
I'd shoot his foot.

1044
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:34,867
You can take the knife.

1045
01:04:38,129 --> 01:04:40,178
Remember, if any of us gets caught,

1046
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:42,587
or he can't make it,
shoot off a flare,

1047
01:04:43,134 --> 01:04:44,593
so the others'll know.

1048
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:49,470
I'll continue West. John, you go North.
Peter, you go South.

1049
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,523
We came from the East,

1050
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,553
so we know that's the wrong way.

1051
01:04:54,146 --> 01:04:55,724
There's not a lotta time.

1052
01:04:56,315 --> 01:04:58,308
There's too much to say, so let's go.

1053
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:01,646
If any of us makes it...

1054
01:05:02,989 --> 01:05:03,819
Well...

1055
01:05:06,368 --> 01:05:09,454
Did I ever tell you the one about
the guy who had a job giving enemas

1056
01:05:09,491 --> 01:05:10,700
to elephants, and?

1057
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:14,622
Thanks.

1058
01:05:20,091 --> 01:05:21,336
Did you ever hear it?

1059
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:24,050
You can tell me about it
when we get home.

1060
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:47,279
<i>Tell Charles that...</i>

1061
01:05:48,414 --> 01:05:51,285
<i>thank him for the composition,</i>
<i>please.</i>

1062
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:54,707
<i>I...</i>

1063
01:05:57,048 --> 01:05:59,006
<i>Well, tell him when I get back...</i>

1064
01:06:00,469 --> 01:06:03,386
<i>I'm gonna take him to</i>
<i>Yosemite again,</i>

1065
01:06:04,598 --> 01:06:05,974
<i>like last summer.</i>

1066
01:06:14,526 --> 01:06:16,981
<i>- I will.</i>
- Right there. Run it again.

1067
01:06:19,448 --> 01:06:20,942
<i>Like last summer.</i>

1068
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:30,413
<i>I will.</i>

1069
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:36,544
'Look, sir. Look, sir.

1070
01:06:36,967 --> 01:06:40,632
Mr. Knox, sir, let's do tricks
with bricks and blocks, sir.

1071
01:06:40,804 --> 01:06:43,889
Let's do tricks
with chicks and clocks, sir.'

1072
01:06:44,058 --> 01:06:46,514
- Blocks! Look, blocks!
- Right.

1073
01:06:46,727 --> 01:06:49,272
There are the blocks
and those are the...

1074
01:06:49,308 --> 01:06:51,404
- Clocks!
- Right.

1075
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:54,152
'First, I'll make a quick trick,
brick stack.

1076
01:06:54,189 --> 01:06:57,236
Then I'll make a quick trick,
block stack.

1077
01:06:57,272 --> 01:07:00,154
You can make a quick trick,
chick stack.

1078
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:03,036
You can make a quick trick,
clock stack.

1079
01:07:03,412 --> 01:07:05,489
- Chicks!
- And?

1080
01:07:05,623 --> 01:07:06,738
Clocks!

1081
01:07:10,295 --> 01:07:12,620
'And here's a new trick,
Mr. Knox.

1082
01:07:13,131 --> 01:07:16,501
Socks on chicks
and chicks on fox.

1083
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:22,387
Fox on clocks,
on bricks and blocks.

1084
01:07:23,601 --> 01:07:27,101
Bricks and blocks
on fox and box.

1085
01:07:32,361 --> 01:07:34,188
Now we come to

1086
01:07:35,698 --> 01:07:37,489
ticks and tocks, sir.

1087
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:42,989
Try to say this,

1088
01:07:44,582 --> 01:07:46,041
Mr. Knox, sir,

1089
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:49,493
clocks...

1090
01:07:50,631 --> 01:07:52,588
clocks on fix tick,

1091
01:07:53,509 --> 01:07:55,549
clocks on Knox tock.

1092
01:07:56,387 --> 01:07:57,466
Clocks!

1093
01:07:58,264 --> 01:07:59,281
Clocks!

1094
01:07:59,317 --> 01:08:00,297
Clocks.

1095
01:08:01,851 --> 01:08:03,643
Right, Sandy, very good.

1096
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,813
'Six, sick,

1097
01:08:10,194 --> 01:08:11,273
bricks,

1098
01:08:12,446 --> 01:08:13,477
tick...'

1099
01:09:25,192 --> 01:09:25,823
Yes?

1100
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:28,695
I'd like to see Mrs. Brubaker.
My name is Caulfield.

1101
01:09:29,072 --> 01:09:30,829
Mrs. Brubaker isn't seeing
anyone.

1102
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:33,819
I telephoned this morning.
I believe I'm expected.

1103
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,331
- What was that name again?
- Caulfield. Robert Caulfield.

1104
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:39,620
Oh, yes. Mrs. Brubaker
is expecting you.

1105
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:42,169
She's out on the patio.
It's right through there.

1106
01:09:42,206 --> 01:09:43,035
Thank you

1107
01:09:52,013 --> 01:09:54,505
- Mrs. Brubaker?
- Mr. Caulfield?

1108
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,761
Sit down, please.

1109
01:10:04,318 --> 01:10:06,525
Mrs. Brubaker, first of all,

1110
01:10:06,779 --> 01:10:09,162
I'd like to say I'm really sorry.

1111
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,655
- Everyone is sor...
- I know, and I appreciate it.

1112
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:16,705
Don't be too uncomfortable with me.
I couldn't put up with that right now.

1113
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:20,579
I understand that you think
you're interrupting me,

1114
01:10:21,212 --> 01:10:24,546
and you are,
but I welcome the interruption.

1115
01:10:25,049 --> 01:10:27,837
You called and said it was something
important. What is it?

1116
01:10:28,553 --> 01:10:31,061
Mrs. Brubaker, it may not be
important to you.

1117
01:10:31,098 --> 01:10:34,099
I'm looking for something that may be
important to me. It's personal.

1118
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:36,526
You're a reporter, aren't you?

1119
01:10:36,562 --> 01:10:39,184
Yes, as I told you,
I'm not looking for an interview.

1120
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:41,489
I would like to ask you
a few questions

1121
01:10:41,526 --> 01:10:45,025
about the last time you spoke with
your husband after the landing.

1122
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,478
What about it?

1123
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:51,942
Well, this may sound strange, Mrs.
Brubaker, don't be upset with me.

1124
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:55,535
Just before the conversation ended,

1125
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:59,384
Colonel Brubaker told you something
about going on a vacation

1126
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:03,216
and your reaction was like you didn't
understand what he was saying.

1127
01:11:03,253 --> 01:11:04,924
Why would you wanna know
about that?

1128
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:07,426
As I told you, it's something personal.

1129
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:09,716
It's personal to me, too.

1130
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,968
Please, I'm not trying to embarrass you
or anyone else.

1131
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,648
Why would any of this be
your business?

1132
01:11:16,684 --> 01:11:18,058
Please, trust me.

1133
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:20,188
Why?

1134
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:23,436
You ask really good questions.

1135
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:30,035
Well, it's all so silly.

1136
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:32,579
It wasn't anything that dramatic.

1137
01:11:32,874 --> 01:11:34,831
Bru just forgot something, that's all.

1138
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:40,084
I don't see the purpose in broadcasting
that my husband mistook a vacation

1139
01:11:40,966 --> 01:11:43,015
when he had so many other things
to think about.

1140
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:45,459
No, no, no, I'm not looking for
anything to broadcast.

1141
01:11:45,721 --> 01:11:48,971
- What are you looking for?
- It has to do with a friend of mine.

1142
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:54,184
- Is there something I should know?
- lf there was anything, I would tell you.

1143
01:11:58,026 --> 01:11:59,402
Well, it's nothing.

1144
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:03,315
Bru said that he wanted to go back
to Yosemite like last year.

1145
01:12:03,866 --> 01:12:06,274
Last year, we went to Flat Rock,
not Yosemite.

1146
01:12:06,577 --> 01:12:09,282
I don't think there's any cosmic
significance in that.

1147
01:12:12,876 --> 01:12:14,774
Mrs. Brubaker, I truly thank you.

1148
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:16,635
I'm sure you had better things to do

1149
01:12:16,671 --> 01:12:19,194
than put up with a bunch of
stupid questions.

1150
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:21,717
No, I didn't.
Have I been any help to you at all?

1151
01:12:22,219 --> 01:12:24,461
I don't know.
May I call you again, sometime?

1152
01:12:25,139 --> 01:12:25,969
Yes.

1153
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,585
Yes?

1154
01:13:00,302 --> 01:13:01,797
There's no one inside?

1155
01:13:03,097 --> 01:13:03,879
Are you sure?

1156
01:13:08,937 --> 01:13:11,724
Get more personnel,
they can't go too far on foot.

1157
01:13:30,836 --> 01:13:32,164
Oh, a piece of cake.

1158
01:15:38,058 --> 01:15:41,262
Charles, cut it out.
You know you're bothering her.

1159
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:44,433
I know you're bothering her and
she knows you're bothering her.

1160
01:15:44,649 --> 01:15:46,772
If you want to stay in the pool,
cut it out.

1161
01:15:55,411 --> 01:15:57,617
- Hi, Uncle Jim.
- Hello there, Charles.

1162
01:16:02,668 --> 01:16:04,412
- Hello, Kay.
- Jim.

1163
01:16:07,674 --> 01:16:09,168
You look just fine.

1164
01:16:09,468 --> 01:16:10,463
Thank you.

1165
01:16:12,012 --> 01:16:13,681
Can I offer you something to drink?

1166
01:16:13,717 --> 01:16:15,009
No, thank you.

1167
01:16:16,684 --> 01:16:18,392
- How are the children?
- Fine.

1168
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:20,812
Charles is strong.

1169
01:16:21,731 --> 01:16:24,187
He's very much to himself,
but he's strong.

1170
01:16:25,235 --> 01:16:26,563
Sandy doesn't know.

1171
01:16:30,282 --> 01:16:35,079
There's gonna be a Memorial Service
on Tuesday, right here, in Houston.

1172
01:16:35,115 --> 01:16:37,119
President... The President'll be here.

1173
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,699
- He's going to speak.
- That's nice.

1174
01:16:40,251 --> 01:16:41,911
Will I get a folded flag?

1175
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,539
I would like you to be there.

1176
01:16:45,882 --> 01:16:46,997
Please.

1177
01:16:47,843 --> 01:16:51,177
I know how difficult everything is
for you right now.

1178
01:16:51,472 --> 01:16:54,806
I feel like Jack the Ripper even
asking you... It's just that...

1179
01:16:55,184 --> 01:16:59,597
it would be good for everyone
if you could go with me to the service.

1180
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:04,685
- It's a horrible way to die.
- No, absolutely not.

1181
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:10,832
When the heat shield separated,
it was over in less than 5 seconds.

1182
01:17:10,868 --> 01:17:15,744
I know that sounds grizzly, but you just
have to know he never suffered.

1183
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:19,038
He died doing what he wanted to do.

1184
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:22,547
Something he felt was important
enough to die for.

1185
01:17:22,584 --> 01:17:23,793
I know, I know.

1186
01:17:25,259 --> 01:17:28,094
I don't think it was important enough
for him to die for.

1187
01:17:29,347 --> 01:17:30,461
I understand.

1188
01:17:32,308 --> 01:17:34,274
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1189
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:39,020
I have no right to intrude on you
like this. I'll call you tomorrow.

1190
01:17:43,779 --> 01:17:44,810
Jim!

1191
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:46,776
I'll go.

1192
01:17:50,995 --> 01:17:52,787
You're a very special woman.

1193
01:17:53,289 --> 01:17:55,081
He was a very special man.

1194
01:17:56,626 --> 01:17:57,706
Thank you.

1195
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,799
- Hey, Uncle Jim!
- Yes?

1196
01:18:03,592 --> 01:18:06,926
- My Dad went to Mars.
- Yes! Yes, he did!

1197
01:18:18,275 --> 01:18:20,184
Oh, I'm dehydrating.

1198
01:18:23,155 --> 01:18:24,614
Dehydrating.

1199
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:27,816
Sign.

1200
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,448
Manual says...

1201
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,833
look for signs.

1202
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:38,285
Water.

1203
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,209
Manual says...

1204
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:44,087
signs for water.

1205
01:19:05,201 --> 01:19:06,779
Oh, dried river bed.

1206
01:19:07,496 --> 01:19:08,694
Signs.

1207
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:11,994
Bend in the river.

1208
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,620
Lower signs.

1209
01:19:16,672 --> 01:19:18,001
Bend in the river.

1210
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:23,919
There's just...

1211
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:27,554
Water.

1212
01:19:28,518 --> 01:19:31,092
River bed.

1213
01:19:38,696 --> 01:19:39,692
Water.

1214
01:19:43,493 --> 01:19:45,533
A drink of water.

1215
01:19:54,046 --> 01:19:56,419
Elizabeth, there's no water.

1216
01:19:57,509 --> 01:19:58,837
There's no water.

1217
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:02,303
I wanna die.

1218
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,599
Elizabeth.

1219
01:20:18,156 --> 01:20:19,105
Birds.

1220
01:20:19,908 --> 01:20:21,153
Elizabeth,

1221
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,073
birds.

1222
01:20:25,748 --> 01:20:27,491
I got to get the birds.

1223
01:20:39,554 --> 01:20:40,753
Helicopters...

1224
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:44,240
Yes?

1225
01:21:47,128 --> 01:21:48,504
He was alone?

1226
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,878
Which direction was he heading
from the airplane?

1227
01:21:57,682 --> 01:22:00,469
Aah, look South and West only.

1228
01:22:00,727 --> 01:22:03,562
Call everybody off North and East.

1229
01:22:03,897 --> 01:22:06,518
The other two are South and West.

1230
01:22:09,987 --> 01:22:12,063
- Hello, again.
- Hello, again.

1231
01:22:14,074 --> 01:22:17,494
- Can I offer you something to drink?
- Yes, thank you.

1232
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:20,913
- What would you like?
- Some scotch. Straight, please.

1233
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:23,919
You haven't found what
you're looking for,

1234
01:22:23,955 --> 01:22:25,843
you're embarrassed about
bothering me again,

1235
01:22:25,879 --> 01:22:28,966
however there were one or two
questions more you'd like to ask me.

1236
01:22:29,002 --> 01:22:32,002
It's something personal and
you won't bother me any more.

1237
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:37,675
I haven't found what I'm looking for.
I feel embarrassed about bothering you.

1238
01:22:38,101 --> 01:22:41,646
However, there are one or two more
questions I'd like to ask you.

1239
01:22:41,683 --> 01:22:44,482
It's something personal and
I won't bother you any more.

1240
01:22:45,609 --> 01:22:49,689
You're up to something, want my help
and you won't tell me what it is. Why?

1241
01:22:50,322 --> 01:22:52,564
You're a very smart lady,
you know that.

1242
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:54,031
Yes.

1243
01:22:54,827 --> 01:22:56,108
I drink too much.

1244
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:59,403
I get in trouble a lot because
I talk too much.

1245
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:03,535
Sometimes I have an imagination
that's a bit too vivid.

1246
01:23:05,339 --> 01:23:07,628
Something's wrong and
I don't know what it is.

1247
01:23:08,134 --> 01:23:12,595
Believe me, I would never do anything
to harm you or your husband, I swear.

1248
01:23:14,933 --> 01:23:16,178
What are you after?

1249
01:23:20,147 --> 01:23:22,655
I'm taking a terrible risk telling you this.

1250
01:23:22,691 --> 01:23:25,942
You may throw me out of here and
I do not want to be thrown out.

1251
01:23:27,822 --> 01:23:31,242
I don't think your husband is the kind
of man who makes mistakes,

1252
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:33,199
no matter how far away he may be.

1253
01:23:33,828 --> 01:23:35,786
I think he was trying
to tell you something.

1254
01:23:36,957 --> 01:23:39,578
- What?
- What did you do at Flat Rock?

1255
01:23:45,007 --> 01:23:46,205
Nothing much.

1256
01:23:47,343 --> 01:23:49,888
We came home after one day
because Charles got sick.

1257
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:52,432
- What'd you do that one day?
- I don't remember.

1258
01:23:54,476 --> 01:23:57,347
We took a tour of the town.
They have those tours.

1259
01:23:58,272 --> 01:23:59,221
And...

1260
01:24:01,025 --> 01:24:02,519
I don't remember what.

1261
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:05,185
- We took some home movies.
- Do you have them?

1262
01:24:05,488 --> 01:24:07,315
- Yes.
- May I see them?

1263
01:24:07,949 --> 01:24:08,779
Yes.

1264
01:24:12,871 --> 01:24:15,279
They were making a movie
the day we were there.

1265
01:24:15,999 --> 01:24:17,708
Bru got a big kick out of it.

1266
01:24:18,168 --> 01:24:21,253
He never knew it took so much time
to just do one simple scene.

1267
01:24:23,466 --> 01:24:26,928
Charles loves that one.
He wasn't in the greatest mood.

1268
01:24:26,965 --> 01:24:28,636
He didn't know it but he was sick.

1269
01:24:31,558 --> 01:24:33,634
Bru was fascinated with the detail.

1270
01:24:34,561 --> 01:24:38,346
He couldn't get over how something
so fake could look so real.

1271
01:24:40,109 --> 01:24:43,313
He kept on saying that with
that kind of technology

1272
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:46,604
you could convince people
of almost anything.

1273
01:24:49,661 --> 01:24:51,239
There's this guy, you see!

1274
01:24:51,413 --> 01:24:53,121
He takes a trip to Europe.

1275
01:24:55,167 --> 01:24:56,875
It's his first vacation

1276
01:24:57,378 --> 01:24:58,706
in a long time.

1277
01:25:00,173 --> 01:25:01,881
He sees the sights, you know?

1278
01:25:06,304 --> 01:25:07,882
He has a real good time.

1279
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,139
Anyway,

1280
01:25:12,603 --> 01:25:15,059
after a while he decides to call home.

1281
01:25:16,107 --> 01:25:19,939
He get his brother on the phone
and the guy says to his brother,

1282
01:25:20,528 --> 01:25:22,023
'How's everything at home?'

1283
01:25:22,989 --> 01:25:24,532
And his brother says,

1284
01:25:34,627 --> 01:25:36,169
'Your... Your cat died.'

1285
01:25:37,297 --> 01:25:39,124
And the guy says to his brother,

1286
01:25:39,257 --> 01:25:41,927
'You shouldn't tell me
bad news like that.'

1287
01:25:42,344 --> 01:25:43,423
'You should

1288
01:25:46,306 --> 01:25:48,050
break it to me gently.

1289
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:50,633
You know...

1290
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,193
You should say something like,

1291
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:03,532
'The cat crawled out on the roof

1292
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,661
and the was chasing the squirrels

1293
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:10,453
and...

1294
01:26:11,918 --> 01:26:13,163
he got stuck.

1295
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:15,621
We had to call the fire department

1296
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:19,292
and when they finally got there,
a fireman crawled up,

1297
01:26:19,718 --> 01:26:21,183
he grabbed the cat

1298
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:25,681
and on the way down he slipped
and the cat fell to the ground.'

1299
01:26:40,324 --> 01:26:42,566
'They had to take the cat to the vet.

1300
01:26:47,999 --> 01:26:49,707
They tried to save the cat.

1301
01:26:52,879 --> 01:26:54,374
They even operated

1302
01:26:54,965 --> 01:26:56,080
on the cat.

1303
01:26:57,676 --> 01:26:59,170
But it was too late.

1304
01:27:02,598 --> 01:27:03,879
They couldn't

1305
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:06,472
save the cat.'

1306
01:27:09,814 --> 01:27:11,475
That's how you should break

1307
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,394
bad news, like that.'

1308
01:27:18,532 --> 01:27:20,691
So the guy says to his brother,

1309
01:27:25,832 --> 01:27:26,911
'How's Mom?'

1310
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:31,289
And the brother says,

1311
01:27:36,552 --> 01:27:37,927
'She's on the roof.

1312
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,478
Get it?

1313
01:27:56,032 --> 01:27:57,442
She's on the roof.

1314
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:06,125
She's on the roof.

1315
01:28:07,878 --> 01:28:08,993
Get it?'

1316
01:28:39,871 --> 01:28:40,820
Yes?

1317
01:28:42,791 --> 01:28:43,989
Which one?

1318
01:28:46,879 --> 01:28:48,587
What direction was he going?

1319
01:28:51,801 --> 01:28:55,253
Brubaker is going West.
Put everybody West.

1320
01:29:06,859 --> 01:29:07,855
Caulfield.

1321
01:29:08,486 --> 01:29:09,517
Right now?

1322
01:29:09,737 --> 01:29:10,816
Okay.

1323
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:24,091
How nice of you to join us here!

1324
01:29:24,128 --> 01:29:26,833
- Listen, I think I got something.
- You need a dermatologist?

1325
01:29:27,089 --> 01:29:28,418
Don't tell me, I'll get it.

1326
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:30,885
- George Raft! Right?
- Where the hell have you been?

1327
01:29:30,922 --> 01:29:31,975
I have to talk to you.

1328
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:35,223
I think I'm onto something. It could be
your actual ball game. I mean it.

1329
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:37,512
Golly, gee, Scoop, that sounds
very interesting!

1330
01:29:37,726 --> 01:29:39,358
Something is wrong. Something big.

1331
01:29:39,395 --> 01:29:41,522
They know I'm onto it and
they tried to kill me.

1332
01:29:41,558 --> 01:29:43,146
- Who's they?
- I can't tell you.

1333
01:29:43,182 --> 01:29:44,734
- Why not?
- You wouldn't believe me.

1334
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:45,848
You don't think so?

1335
01:29:46,361 --> 01:29:48,446
Okay, listen to me.
I got a tip from a friend,

1336
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:50,156
a good friend, then he disappeared.

1337
01:29:50,193 --> 01:29:51,121
Disappeared?

1338
01:29:51,157 --> 01:29:54,411
Like he never existed. There's some
lady living in his apartment.

1339
01:29:54,447 --> 01:29:55,960
His apartment is all different.

1340
01:29:55,996 --> 01:29:58,415
She said she's been living there
for more than a year.

1341
01:29:58,452 --> 01:30:00,256
I checked the building rental office.

1342
01:30:00,292 --> 01:30:02,753
They have receipts from her
for more than a year.

1343
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:04,052
I checked NAS A personnel.

1344
01:30:04,088 --> 01:30:06,758
They have no record
my friend ever worked there.

1345
01:30:06,794 --> 01:30:08,468
They say they never even heard
of him.

1346
01:30:08,505 --> 01:30:09,641
So this friend of yours,

1347
01:30:09,678 --> 01:30:12,436
who works at NAS A,
gives you a tip, then disappears.

1348
01:30:12,472 --> 01:30:15,935
And it turns out that he never lived in
his apartment or worked at NAS A.

1349
01:30:15,971 --> 01:30:18,604
This is the guy that gave you the tip
on your cosmic scoop,

1350
01:30:18,641 --> 01:30:20,565
- and you think I won't believe you?
- My car!

1351
01:30:20,601 --> 01:30:22,113
Someone tampered
with my car!

1352
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,948
The one you decided to go
swimming with?

1353
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:26,154
They did something to it!
I couldn't stop it!

1354
01:30:26,191 --> 01:30:27,269
Can you prove that?

1355
01:30:29,491 --> 01:30:30,866
The police said...

1356
01:30:32,453 --> 01:30:36,082
- They said that nothing was wrong.
- And you think I won't believe you.

1357
01:30:36,118 --> 01:30:37,458
Somebody took a shot at me!

1358
01:30:37,495 --> 01:30:38,756
- When?
- Yesterday.

1359
01:30:38,793 --> 01:30:41,580
- Thank God, I've got an alibi!
- I'm telling you the truth!

1360
01:30:42,422 --> 01:30:45,043
Listen to me and listen good.

1361
01:30:46,927 --> 01:30:50,011
I don't like you, Caulfield.
You're ambitious.

1362
01:30:50,389 --> 01:30:53,841
You think the way to get ahead is to
come up with the scoop of the century.

1363
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:57,527
Woodward and Bernstein were good
reporters. That's how they did it.

1364
01:30:57,563 --> 01:31:01,063
Not by telling me they've located
Patty Hearst three times, like you did.

1365
01:31:01,276 --> 01:31:04,868
Or that brilliant piece of investigative
journalism you pulled off,

1366
01:31:04,905 --> 01:31:08,534
by finding an eyewitness to the 2nd
gunman in the Kennedy assassination.

1367
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:12,163
The small fact that the man had been
in a mental institution at the time,

1368
01:31:12,199 --> 01:31:14,701
never deterred you,
not Scoop Caulfield!

1369
01:31:16,292 --> 01:31:19,551
Now, most reporters are like me.
They are plodders.

1370
01:31:19,587 --> 01:31:23,632
They spend a lot of their time checking
little things..., like facts.

1371
01:31:23,925 --> 01:31:27,010
They cover mundane stories
like wars,

1372
01:31:27,471 --> 01:31:29,013
and trials and hearings.

1373
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,643
You never seem to have enough time
in your busy schedule

1374
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:35,598
to stoop so low as to cover a story.

1375
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:39,865
You occupy your time with tips from
people who never existed,

1376
01:31:39,901 --> 01:31:43,530
driving your car into water and then
claiming it wasn't your fault,

1377
01:31:43,567 --> 01:31:45,488
getting shot at by unseen gunmen.

1378
01:31:46,158 --> 01:31:49,681
Now, I really hate to interrupt
your meteoric career

1379
01:31:49,717 --> 01:31:53,204
with something so plebeian
as a legitimate story.

1380
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:54,573
However,

1381
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,843
a trainload of propane gas
had the bad taste

1382
01:31:57,879 --> 01:32:02,008
to derail near Galveston and there's
a whole town that just might blow up.

1383
01:32:02,593 --> 01:32:05,268
So it would be just really
peachy or you

1384
01:32:05,304 --> 01:32:08,683
if you would join you film crew
that's waiting for you on the plane

1385
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:10,592
at this very moment while we speak.

1386
01:32:11,769 --> 01:32:13,762
- That was a speech.
- I thought so.

1387
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:16,691
I cannot go to Galveston right now.

1388
01:32:16,728 --> 01:32:17,806
I don't think I heard you.

1389
01:32:18,485 --> 01:32:19,399
Look,

1390
01:32:19,695 --> 01:32:22,787
when a reporter tells
his Assignment Editor

1391
01:32:22,823 --> 01:32:26,442
that he thinks he may be onto
something that could be really big,

1392
01:32:26,661 --> 01:32:28,955
the Assignment Editor's suppose
to say,

1393
01:32:28,991 --> 01:32:30,545
'You got forty-eight hours, kid,

1394
01:32:30,582 --> 01:32:32,417
and you better come up
with something good

1395
01:32:32,454 --> 01:32:33,632
or it's gonna be your neck.'

1396
01:32:33,668 --> 01:32:36,129
That's what he's supposed to say!
I saw it in a movie!

1397
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,690
Get your ass on that plane!

1398
01:32:37,727 --> 01:32:39,180
I can't! I have to follow this!

1399
01:32:39,216 --> 01:32:41,907
And you can't tell me what this
earth-shattering story is?

1400
01:32:41,943 --> 01:32:44,597
It sounds too crazy.
If I told you, I'd be in more trouble.

1401
01:32:44,633 --> 01:32:47,559
You're not crazy! I'm crazy!
I'm crazy for listening!

1402
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:49,983
And I'm crazy for saying what
I'm about to say!

1403
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:52,486
I'll give you twenty-four hours
come up with something!

1404
01:32:52,522 --> 01:32:55,808
Not forty-eight! I saw the movie, too,
and it was twenty-four!

1405
01:34:05,852 --> 01:34:06,848
Freeze!

1406
01:34:07,646 --> 01:34:09,857
- I'm not moving an inch.
- Robert Caulfield?

1407
01:34:09,893 --> 01:34:11,939
- Yeah, who the hell are you?
- Federal Agents.

1408
01:34:11,976 --> 01:34:13,950
We have a warrant to search
your apartment.

1409
01:34:13,986 --> 01:34:17,153
- You have a warrant? What for?
- Just don't move.

1410
01:34:17,448 --> 01:34:19,701
I promise. Just tell me
what this is all about.

1411
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:21,112
<i>Hey, come here! Look at this!</i>

1412
01:34:21,286 --> 01:34:23,362
Could you come with me,
please, Mr. Caulfield?

1413
01:34:52,946 --> 01:34:54,773
Mr. Caulfield, I'm sorry.

1414
01:34:55,282 --> 01:34:58,033
However, you're under arrest
for possession of cocaine.

1415
01:34:58,368 --> 01:34:59,566
I don't believe it.

1416
01:35:00,496 --> 01:35:03,117
I don't believe it. You guys put it there,
you know you did.

1417
01:35:03,624 --> 01:35:05,332
You have the right to remain silent.

1418
01:35:08,379 --> 01:35:11,633
- You have the right to an attorney.
- I don't believe it. You put it there.

1419
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:14,338
Anything you say may be held
against you in a court of law.

1420
01:35:14,886 --> 01:35:17,757
You're part of all this. You mothers.

1421
01:35:19,016 --> 01:35:20,214
Ow, that hurts!

1422
01:35:20,476 --> 01:35:22,149
You don't have to put
handcuffs on me!

1423
01:35:22,186 --> 01:35:24,986
Please, Mr. Caulfield, these are
serious charges against you.

1424
01:35:25,022 --> 01:35:28,189
- Don't add to them by resisting arrest.
- I don't bel...! That hurts!

1425
01:35:29,027 --> 01:35:30,521
I don't believe this.

1426
01:35:39,497 --> 01:35:42,367
Well, hello there, Caulfield!
So nice to see you!

1427
01:35:42,959 --> 01:35:46,328
It's at this point that Alan Hale says
to Richard Conte...

1428
01:35:46,921 --> 01:35:49,236
- Jimmy Stewart.
- Yeah, Jimmy Stewart, thank you.

1429
01:35:49,273 --> 01:35:51,551
Look, Scoop, I can't keep bailing you
out of trouble.

1430
01:35:51,588 --> 01:35:52,933
The front office is on my neck.

1431
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:56,181
I don't know how much longer
I can keep them off, right?

1432
01:35:56,218 --> 01:35:57,146
- Right.
- Wrong!

1433
01:35:57,183 --> 01:35:59,894
I got you out of there so as not to
embarrass the Network.

1434
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:02,605
I mean, you are a schmuck!
I can't trust you to cover a fire!

1435
01:36:02,642 --> 01:36:04,604
You'll probably fall down
and get burned!

1436
01:36:04,641 --> 01:36:06,568
You probably would be the cause of it!

1437
01:36:06,604 --> 01:36:08,691
A company car? You are fired!

1438
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:12,032
I love that so much!
I'm gonna say it again!

1439
01:36:12,069 --> 01:36:15,244
You're fired! You're through!
Oh, I love it!

1440
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,126
It's not what it looks like, really.

1441
01:36:17,163 --> 01:36:19,452
'Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!'

1442
01:36:22,168 --> 01:36:25,422
I told you. You tell me about the lonely
plight of a dedicated journalist.

1443
01:36:25,458 --> 01:36:26,511
I tell you to stuff it.

1444
01:36:26,548 --> 01:36:28,467
You tell me about a meaningful
relationship.

1445
01:36:28,503 --> 01:36:29,723
I tell you to stuff it.

1446
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,971
You tell me you're in trouble,
you're out on bail,

1447
01:36:32,007 --> 01:36:34,181
you just got fired,
I tell you I'll be right over.

1448
01:36:34,218 --> 01:36:35,938
- My head hurts.
- You look awful.

1449
01:36:35,975 --> 01:36:37,977
- Thank you, very much.
- You're quite welcome.

1450
01:36:38,014 --> 01:36:39,353
Did you find out what I asked?

1451
01:36:39,646 --> 01:36:42,899
One o'clock in the morning
I get a call from an unemployed junkie

1452
01:36:42,936 --> 01:36:46,153
to find out all the military installations
in a 300 miles radius

1453
01:36:46,189 --> 01:36:47,159
around Houston, Texas.

1454
01:36:47,196 --> 01:36:49,885
You certainly have a way with words.
Did you find out?

1455
01:36:49,921 --> 01:36:52,574
Yes, and it wasn't easy.
It took exhaustive research.

1456
01:36:52,785 --> 01:36:54,459
Well, I'm proud of you.
How many?

1457
01:36:54,495 --> 01:36:58,166
One. White Bluff. It's a S AC base.
My father used to be stationed there.

1458
01:36:58,202 --> 01:36:59,874
That's exhaustive research?

1459
01:36:59,959 --> 01:37:03,130
At one o'clock in the morning,
you call your father, that's exhaustive.

1460
01:37:03,166 --> 01:37:05,382
- White Bluff... That's too big.
- Too big for what?

1461
01:37:05,419 --> 01:37:07,593
- Too big for what I want.
- What do you want?

1462
01:37:07,629 --> 01:37:09,058
I'm thinking of enlisting.

1463
01:37:09,094 --> 01:37:11,889
- They'll never take you.
- That's why I'm thinking of enlisting.

1464
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:14,272
- You're on a story, aren't you?
- I was fired!

1465
01:37:14,308 --> 01:37:17,103
You're on a story and I'm helping you.
This can't be happening.

1466
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:18,360
I really appreciate that.

1467
01:37:18,396 --> 01:37:21,024
The only reason I'm doing it,
considering your track record,

1468
01:37:21,061 --> 01:37:23,819
whatever story you're on
will turn out to be garbage.

1469
01:37:23,855 --> 01:37:25,479
You shouldn't mince words.

1470
01:37:32,578 --> 01:37:34,785
I'll fix you some coffee.
Then you can jump me.

1471
01:37:35,123 --> 01:37:37,163
There's no other one besides
White Bluff?

1472
01:37:37,417 --> 01:37:38,331
No.

1473
01:37:38,794 --> 01:37:41,510
Except one abandoned base
they used for training

1474
01:37:41,547 --> 01:37:44,764
during World War II, Jackson.
There's nothing there now.

1475
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,718
- Don't you want to jump me?
- Of course I do. Where's Jackson?

1476
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:53,049
About 300 miles directly West.
I think I'm gonna get angry with you.

1477
01:37:53,727 --> 01:37:56,432
- Do you have any money on you?
- Do you want me to pay you?

1478
01:37:56,855 --> 01:37:57,861
How much?

1479
01:37:57,898 --> 01:38:00,859
About 100. Why don't I just leave it
on the dresser in the morning?

1480
01:38:00,896 --> 01:38:01,855
Give it to me now.

1481
01:38:02,236 --> 01:38:04,363
In advance?
That's the height of conceit!

1482
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,403
Please, and your car keys.

1483
01:38:10,161 --> 01:38:11,953
You're really being terrific, why?

1484
01:38:13,415 --> 01:38:15,703
You're not as obnoxious
when you are helpless.

1485
01:38:15,739 --> 01:38:17,992
- Thank you very much.
- You're quite welcome.

1486
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:22,263
Also, Liz Haller said you were super.

1487
01:38:22,299 --> 01:38:25,336
Well, when I get back,
we'll jump each other.

1488
01:38:25,553 --> 01:38:26,502
Maybe.

1489
01:38:28,598 --> 01:38:29,796
I'll get arrested again.

1490
01:38:31,059 --> 01:38:32,055
It's a deal.

1491
01:45:15,042 --> 01:45:16,074
Mornin'.

1492
01:45:18,671 --> 01:45:20,711
- Mornin'.
- You in charge here?

1493
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:23,927
- You see that sign there?
- Yes.

1494
01:45:23,964 --> 01:45:24,933
Well, read it.

1495
01:45:24,970 --> 01:45:26,085
- I did.
- Out loud!

1496
01:45:26,638 --> 01:45:28,927
'A and A Crop Dusting Service'.

1497
01:45:29,266 --> 01:45:30,891
You wanna know who I am?

1498
01:45:31,394 --> 01:45:33,025
I'll bet you're one of the 'A's.

1499
01:45:33,062 --> 01:45:36,065
Well, which one? I'll bet you can't
answer that question, smart-ass!

1500
01:45:36,102 --> 01:45:37,310
- The first one.
- Wrong!

1501
01:45:37,734 --> 01:45:40,307
- Can I have one more guess?
- You got it.

1502
01:45:40,612 --> 01:45:41,857
The second one.

1503
01:45:42,489 --> 01:45:46,569
Wrong. I'm both of 'em!
'A' and 'A'. My name is Albain.

1504
01:45:46,827 --> 01:45:51,332
I got a son. The other 'A' was for him,
but he don't like to fly and is a lawyer.

1505
01:45:51,368 --> 01:45:53,256
He's a pervert, so I took the 'A'
away.

1506
01:45:53,292 --> 01:45:55,997
Wanna speak to somebody in charge?
You're speakin' to both o' them.

1507
01:45:56,254 --> 01:45:59,028
- My name is Caulfield.
- Hey, I can't help that.

1508
01:45:59,064 --> 01:46:01,802
Mr. Albain, how much do you charge
to dust a field?

1509
01:46:01,838 --> 01:46:04,293
- 25 dollars.
- I'd like to hire your plane.

1510
01:46:04,638 --> 01:46:07,592
- That'll be 100 dollars.
- You said you charged 25.

1511
01:46:07,975 --> 01:46:11,771
25 dollars t' dust a field, but you ain't
got no field because you ain't a farmer,

1512
01:46:11,807 --> 01:46:14,441
which means you ain't poor
and I think you're a pervert!

1513
01:46:15,609 --> 01:46:16,990
Okay, 100.

1514
01:46:17,027 --> 01:46:18,951
- 125.
- What?

1515
01:46:18,987 --> 01:46:21,407
Because you said 'yes' to 100
too quick,

1516
01:46:21,443 --> 01:46:23,316
which means you can afford 125!

1517
01:46:30,583 --> 01:46:32,007
Where do you wanna go,
smart-ass?

1518
01:46:32,043 --> 01:46:34,212
I'm not sure. I'm looking for someone
who's lost.

1519
01:46:34,249 --> 01:46:35,327
It's your money.

1520
01:48:08,524 --> 01:48:11,652
Put your Goddamn head down
so I can see!

1521
01:48:11,689 --> 01:48:13,526
Why didn't you sit in front?

1522
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:16,106
- You know how to fly?
- No!

1523
01:48:16,657 --> 01:48:18,707
Then I gotta sit in back

1524
01:48:18,743 --> 01:48:22,278
and you gotta put your Goddamn
head down, smart-ass!

1525
01:49:01,790 --> 01:49:04,168
Now, what the hell is your friend doin'
out here?

1526
01:49:04,204 --> 01:49:05,283
He's lost!

1527
01:49:06,337 --> 01:49:08,626
- He rob a bank or somethin'?
- No!

1528
01:49:09,715 --> 01:49:11,839
- Well, I get a third!
- What?

1529
01:49:12,135 --> 01:49:14,596
We find him, I get a third of the loot!

1530
01:49:14,632 --> 01:49:16,672
Now, keep your Goddamn head down!

1531
01:50:07,988 --> 01:50:10,365
You think we should go
in another direction?

1532
01:50:10,402 --> 01:50:11,705
- Hey!
- What?

1533
01:50:11,742 --> 01:50:13,485
- Over there!
- Where?

1534
01:50:13,827 --> 01:50:15,156
Helicopters!

1535
01:50:15,245 --> 01:50:17,404
I seen them fly around here
last couple of days!

1536
01:50:17,581 --> 01:50:19,870
- Let's follow 'em!
- I would if I could see 'em!

1537
01:51:24,821 --> 01:51:26,648
They're goin' down over there!

1538
01:51:55,772 --> 01:51:57,397
He must be in there!

1539
01:51:57,983 --> 01:51:59,145
Let's go down.

1540
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:02,062
They got guns, Sonny!

1541
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:05,105
You said you wanted a third of the loot!

1542
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:08,358
- Half!
- Okay, half!

1543
01:55:10,318 --> 01:55:12,358
Keep your Goddamn head down!

1544
01:57:17,499 --> 01:57:20,749
Pull that lever down by your feet
when I tell you, Sonny!

1545
01:57:30,721 --> 01:57:31,836
Now!

1546
01:58:04,175 --> 01:58:05,373
Perverts!

1547
01:58:06,302 --> 01:58:07,880
Remember, I get half!

1548
01:58:15,938 --> 01:58:17,313
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1549
01:58:17,397 --> 01:58:18,643
<i>Mrs. Brubaker</i>

1550
01:58:18,983 --> 01:58:21,308
<i>Mrs. Willis, Mrs. Walker,</i>

1551
01:58:22,069 --> 01:58:23,564
<i>my fellow Americans.</i>

1552
01:58:24,363 --> 01:58:27,780
<i>I come here today to talk of</i>
<i>unfinished hopes</i>

1553
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:30,402
<i>and of unfulfilled dreams.</i>

1554
01:58:30,954 --> 01:58:34,619
<i>Charles Brubaker, Peter Willis</i>
<i>and John Walker</i>

1555
01:58:35,125 --> 01:58:39,289
<i>left this Earth for their dream</i>
<i>a little more than eight months ago.</i>

1556
01:58:39,547 --> 01:58:41,836
<i>They were never able</i>
<i>to return to us.</i>

1557
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,885
Their dream was able to grow
and flourish

1558
01:58:46,387 --> 01:58:49,724
because of the support of millions
of citizens

1559
01:58:49,761 --> 01:58:50,839
all across America

1560
01:58:51,685 --> 01:58:55,137
at a time when cynicism was
a national epidemic,

1561
01:58:56,190 --> 01:58:59,191
they gave us something
to take pride in.

1562
01:59:00,319 --> 01:59:03,902
It is a dream that
should not be allowed to die.

1563
01:59:05,575 --> 01:59:08,991
A nation is built on the spirit
of its people.

1564
01:59:10,163 --> 01:59:12,322
The test of the greatness
of any nation

1565
01:59:12,666 --> 01:59:15,620
is how that nation pulls together
in a time of crisis.

1566
01:59:16,796 --> 01:59:19,420
The only limits on what
we can achieve

1567
01:59:19,457 --> 01:59:22,045
are the limits we place on our hopes.

1568
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:28,010
These three men reminded us
of the limitlessness of our hopes.

1569
01:59:29,017 --> 01:59:32,138
There was a moment
in these past few days

1570
01:59:32,605 --> 01:59:35,440
when we were all one people.

1571
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:38,023
We were all hoping,

1572
01:59:38,570 --> 01:59:40,609
we were all a little bit taller,

1573
01:59:41,197 --> 01:59:42,740
a little bit prouder.

1574
01:59:43,158 --> 01:59:46,990
We were all feeling the same fears
and the same exhilaration.

1575
01:59:47,454 --> 01:59:49,962
These three men brought us together.

1576
01:59:49,999 --> 01:59:54,211
We knew together that
there are no goals we cannot reach

1577
01:59:54,670 --> 01:59:57,340
if just reach for them together.

1578
01:59:58,508 --> 02:00:00,797
There is no adequate way

1579
02:00:01,219 --> 02:00:04,885
in which we can express our gratitude
to the men themselves

1580
02:00:05,724 --> 02:00:08,429
because they are no longer among us.

1581
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:12,437
However,
we can serve their memory,

1582
02:00:12,648 --> 02:00:14,143
what they stood for...
