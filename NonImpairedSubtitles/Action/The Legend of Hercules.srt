1
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,801
Archers, hold!

2
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:24,311
King Galenus of Argos! Show yourself!

3
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,292
My sword against yours. Victor takes all!

4
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:52,756
This city, or mine, this army, riches...

5
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:55,467
subjects, all! Not another soldier will die!

6
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,681
And I could do to replenish my ranks.

7
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:05,394
What say you, most brave
and merciful king of Argos?

8
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,980
Will you spare these men?

9
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,984
King Amphitryon, I accept your challenge.

10
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,278
Prepare to die.

11
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:24,765
Amphitryon! Amphitryon! Amphitryon!

12
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,209
The campaign ends here, for now.

13
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,128
Chiron told me you took Egypt

14
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,463
because they attacked our ships.

15
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,006
That's right.

16
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,217
But Argos, our neighbor, they presented
no threat.

17
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,471
I see Chiron has been expanding your
Curriculum.

18
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,766
I do not need a tutor to tell me
when there's peace.

19
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,812
I took Argos for you.

20
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,899
For me? You took Argos for its gold.

21
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,361
Yes. That, too.

22
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:24,908
But I'm told they're obsessed
with the gods here, just like you.

23
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:28,912
You know, if they had as many soldiers
as they have priests...

24
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,582
it would be my body on the pyre tonight.

25
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,925
You summoned me, Majesty?
How is Prince Iphicles tonight?

26
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,261
What will you teach him, Chiron?

27
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:50,100
- Will you teach him war?
- It cannot be ignored, Majesty.

28
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,978
History is but a chronicle of war.

29
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,855
And war is but a chronicle of grief...

30
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,649
recounted in the tears of young men's
Mothers.

31
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,610
Sometimes, Majesty...

32
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:03,781
I question who between us is the tutor
and who is student.

33
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:19,546
In my own vanity, I thought I could bring
Tenderness...

34
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,299
to a man whose craving for power is sated
by nothing...

35
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,718
and only grows with each victory.

36
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,179
No god's wrath could bring the anguish...

37
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,557
that my king has beset upon this land.

38
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,644
And so I prostrate myself before you,
Goddess.

39
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,146
Deliver us from this curse.

40
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,317
Help my people.

41
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,530
Majesty!

42
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,077
Hera accepts your gift.

43
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,375
Goddess Hera?

44
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,129
Queen Alcmene... approach.

45
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,214
Majesty, no!

46
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,300
Closer. Let me look upon you.

47
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,139
You will have your deliverer.
Another son you shall bear.

48
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:13,851
No. Please not by this man. Please,
Goddess--

49
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,563
Tell me, would you betray your king...

50
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,774
as my king betrays me in his lust for you?

51
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,776
Would you have his mortal son to quell
your sorrow...

52
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,071
and bring peace to this land?

53
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,577
Would you bear the son of Zeus?

54
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,372
For the sake of peace, I would.

55
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,500
Then, for the sake of peace,
I shall permit it.

56
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,380
Name him what you wish,
but I shall know him as "Hercules".

57
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,341
Hercules

58
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,493
Where is he?

59
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,045
Who is he?

60
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,966
Who is this man you spurn me
for night after night? Who?

61
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,301
Please, Majesty!
- Where is he?

62
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,803
My king!

63
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:19,434
Intruder! Search the camp!
Find him! Find him!

64
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,217
Speak.
-It's a boy, Sire.

65
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,428
A fine, large boy.

66
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,778
His name will be Alcides...

67
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,115
and he will never be an equal
to his older brother.

68
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,502
Hercules.

69
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,797
Your name shall be Hercules.

70
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,573
Be careful, there are snakes in the trees!

71
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,617
I didn't know you fear them!
- Watch out!

72
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,837
So, what else do you fear?

73
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:15,300
I fear but one thing. I always have.

74
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,929
Your departure, each and every time.

75
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,808
Is this another private hideaway?

76
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,020
You just wait. I think you'll like it.

77
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,369
Alcides!

78
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,125
Stop!

79
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,899
Alcides!

80
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,363
Lose something?

81
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,324
You made me nearly faint with fright!

82
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,163
Come. Come here.

83
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,855
I like your necklace.

84
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,360
My mother once gave this
as a parting gift to my father.

85
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,032
And though she's with the gods now...

86
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,619
I want you to have it.

87
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,852
It's only stone...

88
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,688
but I wish it were gold.

89
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,483
I wish there were a substance finer

90
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,151
than that to have you remember me by.

91
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,824
There is.

92
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,245
My mind's eye.

93
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,290
Where your face has been etched since

94
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,835
the day I first saw you.

95
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,576
Careful.
Your horse could have lost its footing.

96
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,829
You be careful... brother.

97
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,790
Princess, your father is worried.

98
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,834
A search party was dispatched.

99
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,752
It's lucky you knew where to find us.

100
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:41,172
Yes. Though I'd rather it had been
some other man's luck.

101
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,262
Princess,
you rode out without saying a word.

102
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,556
And what word would have
permitted me to?

103
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,602
And what word would have
permitted me to?

104
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,521
There is a feast tonight
and she must not be late.

105
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,191
Yes, my Prince.
- No, brother.

106
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,402
You ride with me.

107
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,156
We'll see each other tonight.

108
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,415
Saw your hoof marks in the forest.

109
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,292
Tell me, what would you have done

110
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,752
if she'd been thrown and broken her neck?

111
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,879
I thought you knew her better.

112
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,131
More likely I would break my neck.

113
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,468
I saw more than hoof marks today.

114
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,972
Did you?
- Watch yourself!

115
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,352
I've known her just as long as you have,
and with a more mature eye!

116
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,438
I'm older than you, Alcides,
and heir to the throne!

117
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,745
Let's back away slowly.
Don't turn your horse.

118
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,873
No, let's escape. Your horse can outrun it.
- Yours wouldn't.

119
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,716
What are you doing?

120
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:11,721
Now, back your horse behind me.
- Oh, yes, of course.

121
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,266
And what a tale of bravery the next king
of Tiryns will have to tell tonight.

122
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:21,690
Iphicles! The point
of this was for one of us to get away.

123
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,908
A Nemean lion.
- A man eater! They can't be killed!

124
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,834
Our spears are useless!

125
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,349
Alcides!

126
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,124
Iphicles. Where have you been?

127
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,918
What is that thing? Take it off.

128
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:28,673
Why, it appears to be the skin
of the Nemean lion!

129
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,635
The lion, which I killed but two hours ago.

130
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,388
Look, this is where it struck.
You see, Father?

131
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:40,226
But I'm all right. No cut to the eye.
- Where was your brother in this contest?

132
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,771
Alcides?

133
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,194
He ran away at the first sign of danger.

134
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,615
Have you ever known
my brother flee danger?

135
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,909
Have you, Princess?

136
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,870
No. Never.

137
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:03,416
Well... I thought you knew him
better than that.

138
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,589
Tell them. Father.

139
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,967
So it has a chance to sink
into some of the thicker heads here.

140
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:20,141
My friend, King Tallas the Brave,
ruler or Crete...

141
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,561
we have enjoyed free
commerce between our lands...

142
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,107
tonight we make a bargain
for something far greater.

143
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,400
The peace between our houses
will be sealed four moons hence...

144
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:34,614
with the harvest moon,
when my heir, Prince lphicles..

145
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,076
Will take the Princess
of Crete to be his wife!

146
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,370
Yes!

147
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,268
Hebe! Hebe, stop!

148
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,117
Why don't you enlighten me
on what just happened.

149
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:23,371
I believe the announcement
took them by surprise, Father.

150
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,707
The only surprise is that you allowed her
to behave in such a manner...

151
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,503
without even lifting a finger, lion slayer.

152
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,007
What could I have done?

153
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,342
I am Amphitryon the Conqueror...

154
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,095
ruler of the realm, vanquisher of Argos.

155
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,890
You are my son,
and tonight you stood and watched...

156
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,768
as your future wife made
a fool of you and me...

157
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,313
in front of our most formidable
threat: Crete.

158
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,900
Look at them. It makes you look weak.

159
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,361
I'm sorry, Father.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

160
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,614
I want you to be a man.

161
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,326
You're the future king of Tiryns. Act like it.

162
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,124
Hebe! Hebe, stop!

163
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,543
Stop! Stop!

164
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,680
Come here.

165
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,477
I won't marry him.

166
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,479
I'd rather die.

167
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,650
I love you.

168
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,655
I love you, too.

169
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,324
I need you strong.

170
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,826
Are you strong?

171
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,624
I want to leave with you... tonight.

172
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,892
If we can make it across the river to Tyga...

173
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,727
the King's men Won't follow us.

174
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,952
That's them!
- Go, Hebe, run west!

175
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:29,580
No, I won't leave you!
- I'll be right behind you! Go!

176
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,458
After them!

177
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,840
You two, follow her! Now!

178
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,513
You heard the orders! Don't hurt the Prince!

179
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,989
Faster!

180
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,546
Stop! Stop!
- Alcides!

181
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,470
Hebe!
- Help!

182
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,181
Alcides!

183
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,100
Help!

184
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,365
Alcides!

185
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,652
Captain Sotiris.

186
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,695
Is the Fourth Battalion ready
to sail tomorrow?

187
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:28,783
160 men, Your Grace, ready
and accounted for, as you commanded.

188
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,620
Good. You'll take half. No more.

189
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,207
Half?
- You are young.

190
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,794
Learn to keep 80 in line and we'll see
about expanding your command.

191
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,135
You disapprove?

192
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,389
No, Your Grace.

193
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,184
We'll be victorious and honor your name.

194
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,603
I have him, Father!

195
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,782
I understand you're having some trouble
with the arrangements we've made.

196
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:14,036
Your arrangements you may find spoiled
by the next harvest moon.

197
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:17,999
I think not.
You sail to Egypt tomorrow.

198
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,840
There's been a revolt in Heliopolis,
north of the Nile River delta.

199
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,969
You will enjoy war, Alcides,
and you will forget all this.

200
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,346
I certainly don't fear for your survival.

201
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:37,143
May your mother's gods be with you,
if they be at all.

202
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,481
Ask him about Hebe.

203
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,316
One final thing.

204
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,902
Your brother here seems
obsessed with the thought...

205
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:48,404
that you've taken the girl's maidenhood.

206
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,491
Why don't you reassure him
that's not the case.

207
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,242
Certainly, I shall.

208
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,787
I assure you, brother...

209
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,999
it's none of your business.

210
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:16,516
I wish you endless victories
in the battlefield, brother.

211
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:20,436
Because if you return here, I will kill you.

212
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,987
Alcides, I beg you to understand...

213
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,698
that you have a purpose
on this earth beyond this one desire.

214
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,701
I've no purpose other than claiming
the love that is mine!

215
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:39,497
I damn the King for denying it to me, and I
damn the gods for taking her from me!

216
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,667
Hercules!
- Majesty, no.

217
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,674
What did you call me?

218
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,927
You are not the son of Amphitryon.

219
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:57,431
I swear on my love for you,
you are Hercules...

220
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,851
Gift of Hera, son of Zeus.

221
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,312
Chiron.
- My Prince.

222
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,439
Has my mother spoken of this to anyone?

223
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,442
No. I assure you, no one.

224
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:11,195
Because the King is a jealous man...

225
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,407
and most likely would believe this mad talk.

226
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,624
Open the gates!

227
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,233
Alcides!

228
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,571
Hold!

229
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,826
Have heart, my love!
I will return before you know it!

230
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,953
And you will be marrying me!

231
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,331
Three moons from now!

232
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,105
What troubles you?

233
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,151
The King first ordered my full company...

234
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,612
then halved it before we left.

235
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:21,075
There's no campaign underway.
Peace is secured in Crete.

236
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,494
Two divisions lay idle in camp.

237
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,081
Why would that fool deny me even
the smallest excess of troops?

238
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,292
We do not know what awaits us
in Heliopolis!

239
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:54,316
Horus Pass.
We'll be there by sunset and make camp.

240
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,485
There must be another way
than through a pass.

241
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,072
Along with our numbers,
our route was changed as well.

242
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:03,200
Your father wants us
in Heliopolis a day sooner.

243
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,744
Scouts forward!

244
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,094
Plenty of water for all!

245
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,222
Cold and clean.

246
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,726
Any word of the scouts?
It's been too long since they left.

247
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,937
Make camp here.
Feed the horses and the men.

248
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,148
Now, we need 20 volunteers on foot...

249
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,317
cause we're gonna secure the passage.

250
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,160
Some say the Golden Eagle's
a sign from Zeus.

251
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,245
Yes. And some believe it's just a bird.

252
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,737
Sotiris.

253
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:29,286
Men... fall back to the camp.

254
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,217
I led them to their deaths.

255
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:07,533
Fall back! Retreat! Back the way we came!

256
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,170
Battle formation!

257
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,801
Testudo!

258
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,145
Archers!

259
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,071
Archers! Form up!

260
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,300
We're the only two left!
- Take them alive!

261
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,653
Commander Tarak.
- Over here.

262
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,321
The Prince's helmet.

263
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,826
Who is the captain?

264
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,037
I am.

265
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,958
Is this the helmet of the Prince
named Alcides?

266
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,046
Is it?
- Yes.

267
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,173
Where does he lie?

268
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,846
Where does he lie?

269
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,348
He lies there.

270
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,225
Where you got him.

271
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,939
Take this to the King.

272
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,987
Captain, you are strong-willed...

273
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,198
but this one, even half dead...

274
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:36,575
he's twice as strong as my best fighter.

275
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,413
If I thought you'd live,
I'd sell you both for a princely sum.

276
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:47,086
Sell us. Sell us!
Sell us.

277
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,340
We will live.

278
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,678
Who are you, soldier?

279
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,598
Hercules.

280
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,603
I cooled it off for you.

281
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,900
There's far worse pain awaiting
where you two are going.

282
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,362
Would the King really do this?

283
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,490
Sacrifice is own men to ensure
the death of one?

284
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,492
His own son!

285
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:46,455
Why did you choose to live?

286
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,292
Do you know of the engagement...

287
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,921
between my brother lphicles
and Hebe, Princess of Crete?

288
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:57,382
Yes.
It was announced before our departure.

289
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:01,261
I must make it back to Tiryns
before the wedding.

290
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,098
You stay by my side...

291
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,018
I'll make you a guest of honor...

292
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:12,314
at what shall be my wedding.

293
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,780
I fear you've been within
the palace walls too long, my Prince.

294
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,452
I've traveled the world...

295
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,206
and I know what's out there.
- You are wrong.

296
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,252
Surely you have something to return to.

297
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,505
Of course.

298
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,551
A wife and son.
- Set your mind on them.

299
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,845
And nothing else!

300
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:58,026
So, tell me...

301
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:02,406
who is this... Hercules?

302
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,409
I don't yet know.

303
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,978
Mother?

304
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:36,315
Are you sick, Mother?

305
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,902
Do I seem so?
- Often. At the sight of me.

306
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,988
This is foolish talk.

307
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,325
You are my son.

308
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,243
The one who is living.

309
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,038
Yet I feel more absent
than the one who is not.

310
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:54,541
Iphicles...
we are both grieving.

311
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,210
But in this sea of grief there
must be a drop of felicitation.

312
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,421
I am to be wed three moons hence.

313
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,258
Yes.

314
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,762
You are right.

315
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:10,223
You have won yourself a fine bride.

316
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:13,852
A bride, yes. But have I won a wife?

317
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,439
She will serve you well.

318
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,026
Is this my hope?

319
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:24,363
Mother, how do I win her
as my father won you?

320
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:27,157
Please. I am not Alcides.

321
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,742
I know that. To her or to you.

322
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,660
Your father won me but for a moment...

323
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,830
which passed so fast I cannot remember.

324
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,291
This is what you will have with Hebe.

325
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,335
This is what has come of it.

326
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,630
A marriage that she does not want...

327
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,510
and the death of your brother.

328
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,730
I paid good money for both of you.

329
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,941
I expect a return.

330
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,782
Hercules, what is it?

331
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,700
It's the first full moon.

332
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,412
She does not even know I live.

333
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,638
Come on!

334
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,433
You miserable misers!

335
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,103
I was told you Sicilians had money!

336
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,902
Who wants to bet on Sotiris?

337
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:52,701
Tell me, friend,
can you win your way out of here?

338
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,286
Oh, yes.

339
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,581
That way.

340
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,724
You're next, Greek.

341
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,935
You'd better win just as much
as your friend there...

342
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,355
or perhaps you prefer to breathe mud.

343
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:28,361
You said... "Stay by my side."

344
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,697
I say we're doomed.

345
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:35,243
I promise you,
I will return you to your family.

346
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:38,163
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

347
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:48,650
Kill! Kill! Kill!

348
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:58,285
You called for me. I am here.

349
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,496
Thank you for joining me...

350
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,583
so that Hera may bless this marriage.

351
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:14,759
Why do you look at me this way?

352
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,638
Have you found peace, Alcmene?

353
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:20,223
If you will tell me

354
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:24,269
how my son found his death,
I would.

355
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:30,942
Will you tell me how he found life?

356
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,819
Yes.

357
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,530
Yes, Amphitryon, at long last I will tell you.

358
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,992
He was not my son, I know it!

359
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,247
Do not dare deny it!
- I will not.

360
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:48,877
Who sired him? Tell me!
Do you even know?

361
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,004
How many lovers did you take?
- One!

362
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,715
You lie!
- I took one for a single night...

363
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,469
and for a single purpose:
To put an end to your rule!

364
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:02,682
Tell me!
- Zeus!

365
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,684
Zeus came to my bed
and planted a seed in me...

366
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,729
to spawn a son to end your tyranny!

367
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:11,650
And now, you have murdered
the son of the god of gods...

368
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:15,278
and you are doomed. You are doomed.

369
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:25,038
You're doomed.

370
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,875
No! No!

371
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,054
The Queen...

372
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,766
in her grief, has taken her own life.

373
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:55,860
You made me a fortune today, Hercules.

374
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,029
Your trifles are of no interest to me.

375
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:02,283
A man of great enterprise.
- "Great enterprise."

376
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,787
You want real enterprise,
you take us to Greece.

377
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:08,998
Greece?
- In the kingdoms of Greece...

378
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:10,750
your games would draw thousands.

379
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,461
I draw thousands here.

380
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:17,632
Thousands of laughs, he means.
- Laughs? What do you mean?

381
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:22,929
Let me put it this way,
in King Amphitryon's lands...

382
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,765
sport is war and war is sport.

383
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,016
And between the two, the King...

384
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:30,395
is Hades' most reliable supplier.

385
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,816
Now, they hold an event once a year...

386
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:39,195
that is the most elaborate,
beautiful and rich affair--

387
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,906
You know, actually, it's not for you.
No, it's the purest stuff there.

388
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:46,035
None of this slipping in mud,
dancing on beams.

389
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:48,747
Oh, no. Just men on solid ground...

390
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:50,582
wielding bronze forged into shapes...

391
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,376
even the tyrant King himself
could not have conceived of.

392
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:57,046
How is the wagering?
- How's the wagering?

393
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:02,385
My friend, I doubt you have
the imagination to even dream of it.

394
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,512
For example, in the final contest,
and that means...

395
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,682
the richest contest, mind you...

396
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:11,811
two men fight against six.

397
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,606
Six that have never been beaten.

398
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:18,610
Now, if they win, well, the two go free.

399
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,987
But the odds would be against it.

400
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,491
You'd find advantage in that, I'm sure.
- But if they win--

401
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,618
Tidy sum of gold in it for you.

402
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:29,788
Why would I fight you two?

403
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:32,457
We've never lost.
- Neither have they.

404
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,002
Cut his head off,
he would not be any dumber

405
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,505
One must fight with brawn and brain.

406
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,215
Mind your words, my friend.

407
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,928
I will arrange the grandest arena in Sicily.

408
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:49,015
You two battling Half-Face and Humbaba.

409
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,477
The victors shall go on a boat...

410
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,522
with me to Greece.

411
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:06,699
And now... for the event you
have been waiting for!

412
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:09,661
Four unbeaten champions of Sicily...

413
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:13,790
battling for a journey
to the greatest tourney in Greece!

414
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:17,085
I give you the ferocious...

415
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,337
the terrifying...

416
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:24,050
Half-Face and Humbaba!

417
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:31,432
And their challengers...

418
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:37,939
Hercules and Sotiris of Tiryns!

419
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,337
Hercules!

420
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,473
Humbaba!

421
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,835
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

422
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,944
Fight! Fight! Fight!

423
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,436
Sotiris!

424
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,331
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

425
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:49,088
Are you mad? He was wounded.

426
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,549
You killed the only man
who could replace him.

427
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:52,842
I can still fight, Lucius!
- Right!

428
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,553
Against the six best fighters in Greece.

429
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,681
You're as good as dead.
The agreement is off.

430
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:02,727
You're back in the pits tomorrow.
- We won't fight.Unless in Greece.

431
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:03,895
Then you'll die.

432
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,982
Go ahead, kill us.
Who then will fight for your silver?

433
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:08,775
You dare to threaten me?

434
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:12,070
Would you really lose
your two best fighters?

435
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:15,656
Would you see your money bag
even a single piece of silver lighter...

436
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:18,076
you miserable, gutless old miser?

437
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:20,328
Look at you! You can hardly walk!

438
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:23,831
You're useless!
What I need to take you for?

439
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,708
Because you're setting him free.
- No, Hercules.

440
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:29,378
I will fight them. Alone.

441
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:33,466
Then you are going to a certain death.

442
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:50,483
We have another two days at sea!

443
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:54,070
He's been at the bow
ever since we left the port.

444
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:18,594
My name is Sotiris,
Captain of the Fourth Division.

445
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,681
I rode for Heliopolis with your Prince...

446
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,724
and we're the only two survivors.

447
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:27,854
The other is a man of much renown.

448
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,023
His name is Hercules.

449
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:43,327
A man has come to our shores!

450
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:47,999
A slave with the name of Hercules!

451
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:51,460
A "Gift of Hera" we are to believe!

452
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:56,299
We return him not as a man,
but as a pile of bloody guts and bone...

453
00:52:56,424 --> 00:53:00,595
on which the canines
of Olympus may feast!

454
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:07,602
I give you...

455
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:10,271
Hercules!

456
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,780
He is fighting for his freedom...

457
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:26,162
against the six greatest undefeated
champions of Greece!

458
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:44,555
Commander. Captain.

459
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:49,060
See for yourself.
- And you tell us this is Prince Alcides?

460
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,103
And if it is, you're with us?

461
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:54,190
Yes. And not us alone,
Sotiris. I promise you.

462
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,610
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

463
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,560
My Prince.

464
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,854
Chiron, give me news of Hebe!

465
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,400
Please, Chiron, will you bring her to me?

466
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:45,778
I will find some way.

467
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,782
Thank you, Sotiris.
I know you have someone to see, as well.

468
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:51,200
Soon enough.

469
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:54,703
Tell him the condition of the army.

470
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:58,040
There's a great mistrust ever since
your company perished.

471
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,669
The King is squeezing anything he can
from the people to hire foreign mercenaries.

472
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:04,422
I will sound out our most trusted officers.

473
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:06,048
They will rally to us.

474
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:12,138
And my brother, will he come to our side?

475
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:15,057
It is his men pillaging the villages.

476
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,768
And any spoils are their wages.

477
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:20,354
I fear you'll have to defeat...

478
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:22,815
both this king and the next.

479
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:28,779
Chiron, you must not let on a thing to Hebe.

480
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,990
She could never hide happiness.

481
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:34,452
Now, "Gift of Hera"...

482
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:38,956
call upon all your strength,
because I must tell you something.

483
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:47,256
I have terrible news about your mother.

484
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,967
She is no longer with us.

485
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:54,263
She met her death with her own dagger.

486
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:01,395
I drew it myself from her chest...

487
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:04,690
as the King fled the temple.

488
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:08,652
Your name was on her dying breath.

489
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,992
The King will pay for this.

490
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,583
Will your men stay behind us?

491
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,961
They are your men now.

492
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,257
They will stand behind you.

493
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,718
As will I.

494
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,721
Out of my way, woman!

495
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,932
Move, woman! Move!

496
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,643
We're taking your property
in the name of the King!

497
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,853
No! Please, don't!

498
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:46,565
Get down on your knees!

499
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,860
Does it really take four men
to steal one man's livelihood?

500
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:52,947
Draw swords!

501
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,199
Stand down.

502
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:22,977
Is it true? You are Hercules, the god?

503
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,606
No, I'm just a man.

504
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,446
It's time to send the King a message.

505
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,624
Now I understand why your men
prefer desertion, lphicles.

506
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:48,168
I just received the news.
- Of what?

507
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:52,256
These three bumbling half-wits,
or the rising rebellion at our doorstep?

508
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:56,302
Majesty, they say Sotiris, Captain of
Fourth Division, is back.

509
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:57,845
He is leading the desertion.

510
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:00,598
Father, I'll take responsibility for this.

511
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:04,351
Let me find Sotiris.
I'll make him lead us to Hercules.

512
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:10,149
When our allies from Egypt, Germania,
and the horn of Africa arrive tomorrow...

513
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:14,653
Sotiris, Hercules,
even Zeus himself will be but a memory.

514
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:21,201
What is this place?
- Captain Sotiris arranged it.

515
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,379
This house will serve as safe haven,
it would appear.

516
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:36,050
The woman inside says she knows you.

517
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:39,136
She says she fled Argos
with the King's invasion.

518
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:50,481
You swear to me this is
the second son of Alcmene...

519
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:52,608
slain Queen of Tiryns?

520
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:55,611
Yes. Alcides.

521
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:59,490
Though he's known now to the people--
- As Hercules.

522
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:03,118
Yes, I know. I was present for the naming.

523
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:19,218
My friend says you were of Argos
until my father brought his wrath upon it.

524
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:22,763
Your father brought wrath upon many...

525
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:25,683
but Argos, that was a mortal's doing.

526
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:30,062
Where have you brought me?
- To the truth, Hercules.

527
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,064
To the truth of you.

528
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:37,027
You may claim your bride and ride
a thousand days, it will not matter.

529
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:41,281
Your destiny lies in something beyond.

530
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:45,035
Yourjourney in life
will take you farther from love...

531
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,121
than you can imagine.

532
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:51,875
My mother said that very thing...

533
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,669
the last day I set eyes on her.

534
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:57,548
She was wise. But even she
did not understand the whole of it.

535
01:01:57,673 --> 01:02:00,843
You must accept who you are.

536
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:05,055
Only then can you unlock
the doors to your own potential.

537
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,558
Embrace your father,
and you will discover...

538
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:09,643
powers that you never imagined.

539
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:13,188
Where was this father when 80 good men
perished next to me?

540
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,817
Where was he when my mother
was murdered?

541
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:21,113
Your father has always been there,
Hercules.

542
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,198
You were just not ready for him.

543
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:26,618
Zeus can't change the minds of mortals...

544
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:29,705
but he has given you a gift.

545
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:33,375
And be warned,
abuse it and it will lead to your destruction.

546
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:38,464
Respect it,
and it will save you and those you love.

547
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:56,440
You will accept me... love me.

548
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:57,775
We will have children...

549
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,028
and you will love every one equally!

550
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:03,280
Won't you? Equally!

551
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,909
Iphicles.

552
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:11,789
Restore me to my home.

553
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:14,750
Return me to my father.

554
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,419
The gods do not want this marriage.

555
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:23,133
I do not want this marriage.

556
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,385
Well, it Will be.

557
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,807
Mark me, two moons hence.

558
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,103
Or you may take your life, as well.

559
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,801
Princess!

560
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,929
Princess.

561
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:13,767
I cannot bear it, Chiron.

562
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:16,353
I'm sick of living.

563
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,522
The gods save me!

564
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:22,067
What would have happened had
I not just now returned?

565
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:25,487
You were gone for days,
with not a word to me.

566
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:28,448
I'm sorry, Princess.

567
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,784
There was a reason.

568
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:33,495
You say this to me...

569
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,999
as if I'm blind to the moon's phase.

570
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,335
I know what's in store.

571
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,797
No, you don't.

572
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:50,405
It's me.

573
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,240
It's me.

574
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:32,698
How did you keep it...

575
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,534
when you lost so much else?

576
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:41,873
Because losing this, I would've lost it all.

577
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:50,340
It's mine! You gave it to me, yeah?

578
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:11,069
Is there still pain?
- Have no worry.

579
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,331
Where should we go?

580
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:25,667
No, not where. Doesn't matter where.

581
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:29,755
Just that we go. And this time,
I shall escape him.

582
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:40,974
We will be together...

583
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,769
but not in any foreign land.

584
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,522
Not in Tyga.

585
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:50,400
But here...

586
01:07:51,026 --> 01:07:53,111
in my homeland.

587
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:14,674
Your Majesty,
I understand there's a small problem.

588
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:19,262
Tell me, Tarak, did I not pay you
a sizeable amount of gold...

589
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:21,306
to kill every last man of those 80 men?

590
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,141
Yes, of course.

591
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,310
Then how is it there is a survivor?

592
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:30,524
And not only Captain Sotiris,
but another man.

593
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:34,653
A savior people call "Hercules".

594
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,114
He is rallying the villagers...

595
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:40,283
and even my own soldiers
against my rule.

596
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,577
What are you going to do about it?

597
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:44,830
Answer me!

598
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:54,840
If, and I say, if this is true...

599
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:57,384
I will rectify this error.

600
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:10,856
Darling flower, I missed you.

601
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:13,525
And I hate to say it, but...

602
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,527
we need to leave now.

603
01:09:17,946 --> 01:09:22,534
What is it? ls the bloom off
the rose so soon after my arrival?

604
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,505
Is this him?

605
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,216
Yes.

606
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:43,305
How is it you survived?
No one survives those places.

607
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,684
Hope.

608
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:55,901
I was given hope.

609
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:01,740
Stop!

610
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,706
And what is your hope now,
Captain Sotiris?

611
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:18,423
That my son's life be spared.

612
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:24,012
Then take us to Hercules.

613
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,583
Hercules.

614
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:03,301
I didn't believe him.
And I'm not certain I do now.

615
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:07,472
You... are Hercules.

616
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,810
Take him away! Take Sotiris
and execute the others!

617
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,997
Stand aside for the King!

618
01:11:44,426 --> 01:11:48,847
People of Tiryns,
I give you your mighty Hercules.

619
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:54,019
He bleeds! And why?

620
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:57,772
Because he is nothing
more than an impostor!

621
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:02,902
A liar! A man of flesh and blood!

622
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:06,323
And what has this so-called
savior wrought?

623
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:10,160
Your farms lie untilled,
your villages lay burned...

624
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:13,330
and your brothers rot dead in the fields!

625
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:16,041
Is this the message of hope?

626
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:24,049
So, self-proclaimed son of Zeus...

627
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:26,551
how will you offer these people
their salvation...

628
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:29,054
when you cannot even save yourself?

629
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,477
Bring out the other traitors!

630
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,485
Take me, but spare these good men!

631
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:46,196
He begs for mercy for his traitors!

632
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:49,866
Iphicles, your future king!

633
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:07,926
Strike this affliction from our lands forever.

634
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:11,054
So that tonight we may celebrate...

635
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,681
as you wed the Princess of Crete!

636
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:20,355
Brother! Brother! Brother!

637
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:24,275
Chiron was there when you were born.

638
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:25,568
You were sick.

639
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:28,780
Kill him.
- My Prince.

640
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,617
This life has not been wasted.

641
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:37,080
I have had the honor to stand
by the greatest hero...

642
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:40,750
the gods have ever given the people.

643
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,840
Brother... please.

644
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,274
Father!

645
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:07,652
I believe in you!

646
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:14,576
Grant me strength!

647
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:28,631
Retreat!

648
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:34,012
Do something! Stop him!

649
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,270
Commissionaires!
- Kill him!

650
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:52,799
Get up. Get up. Come on.

651
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:09,232
We stand with you, my Prince, as do
the four divisions under our command.

652
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:12,151
The people are ready to lay
down their lives for you, Hercules.

653
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:14,445
Lead us to victory!

654
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,764
Brave men of Tiryns!

655
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,892
I can only lead you through those gates!

656
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:46,936
What our fate is beyond them, I cannot say.

657
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:51,649
I only know what fate there is in retreat.

658
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:55,278
Tonight we fight, not for what we have...

659
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:59,699
but for that which has been
so savagely ripped from our breast!

660
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:03,202
Alcides the Prince...

661
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:06,039
betrays his king...

662
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:11,753
but a son of Zeus takes
his first breath of life tonight...

663
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:14,881
and fulfills his promise to his father.

664
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:19,344
Let this night be forever remembered...

665
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:21,346
as the hour upon which...

666
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:24,891
we took back our kingdom!

667
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,467
There is my bride.

668
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:02,470
I declare to you that I love another.

669
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:06,099
He's the reason I want to wake up
in the morning and embrace the day.

670
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:12,230
If you so wound him that
his face were unrecognizable to me...

671
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:14,315
I would love him.

672
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:19,070
If his tongue were cut from his throat
and I hadn't his voice to delight me...

673
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:21,614
I would love him.

674
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:27,453
And if you make only a memory of him...

675
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:31,249
I would love him even more eternally.

676
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,921
That is what you have to look forward to.

677
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:43,845
Halt in the name of the king!

678
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:46,013
Identify yourselves!

679
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:49,767
You will be fired upon! Archers ready!

680
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:52,478
Shields!

681
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:04,866
That is Sotiris and the men of the Fourth!
We were told they'd deserted!

682
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:07,827
Captain!
- Hold your fire!

683
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,831
I have taken arrows before!

684
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:16,335
If you fight to defend tyranny,
let them fly!

685
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:29,932
Men!

686
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:33,853
We take Tiryns! We take our lands!

687
01:19:47,492 --> 01:19:49,118
Lower your aim!

688
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,132
Sotiris!

689
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,520
Fire!

690
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:23,736
We are with you, Hercules!

691
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:27,323
Forward!

692
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:51,055
King Amphitryon! Show yourself!

693
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,850
Where are you, you coward!

694
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:56,227
Hiding with your Prince?

695
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:06,571
Hercules!
I apologize for the Prince...

696
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:10,032
but he's about to consummate
his marriage to Queen Hebe...

697
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:13,327
the future wife of the next king of Tiryns!

698
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:16,706
And as for myself, well,
I come to welcome you home.

699
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:20,459
As a matter of fact,
I have a little surprise for you.

700
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,180
Battle formation!

701
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:47,737
King Amphitryon,
my sword against yours!

702
01:21:47,862 --> 01:21:49,488
Victor takes all!

703
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:54,285
The city, its subjects, army, riches!

704
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,704
Not another soldier shall die!

705
01:21:56,829 --> 01:22:01,125
What say you, most brave
and merciful King of Tiryns?

706
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,586
Will you spare these men?

707
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:07,632
Imitation, the highest form of flattery.

708
01:22:07,757 --> 01:22:10,259
Accept your destiny!

709
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,846
Cause I already rule it all, my son.

710
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:16,807
I'm not your son, you murdering coward!

711
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:21,729
And the one who rules
it all is my TRUE father!

712
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:26,275
Lay down your weapons or prepare to die!

713
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:35,993
Tarak, kill the traitors!

714
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,578
Soldiers!

715
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:44,919
Prepare to...

716
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:27,586
Slaughter!

717
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:42,309
Have you come to bring
the wrath of Zeus upon me, boy!

718
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:46,480
No! I come to you as a mortal...

719
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:49,275
to bring the wrath of Alcides...

720
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,986
upon the tyrant who killed my mother.

721
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:57,283
Come at me, boy, and learn...

722
01:23:57,408 --> 01:24:00,244
why I am the slayer of kings!

723
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:01,787
Come!

724
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:24,935
Get up!

725
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:51,313
Brother! Release him!

726
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:54,358
Release him this moment, or I will kill her.

727
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:59,613
My son...
you may not be a total loss after all.

728
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:04,076
Alcides, I do not matter.

729
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:05,870
Do you agree, brother?

730
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:10,082
Because as long as you can't have her,
she does not matter to me.

731
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:14,962
And she's made it perfectly clear,
I do not matter to her.

732
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,925
Brother, no!
- Release him!

733
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,180
We shall be together, my love.

734
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:33,856
No!

735
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:47,137
My love.

736
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:49,723
Do not fear.

737
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:53,227
I fear...

738
01:27:53,352 --> 01:27:57,982
but one thing, I always have...

739
01:27:58,107 --> 01:28:02,111
your departure each and every time.

740
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:11,912
I'm here now.
- This time, please stay.

741
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:14,873
I promise.
