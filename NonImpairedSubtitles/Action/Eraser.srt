1
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:11,712
He's here.

2
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,710
Hold your fire!

3
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,795
Lee...

4
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:56,673
...just drop your weapon.

5
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:09,186
Move!

6
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:20,405
- You're late!
- Traffic.

7
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:25,119
- How's your ammo?
- I'm out.

8
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:29,039
Damn it! Two rounds left.

9
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,290
Move!

10
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,126
Ready to go?

11
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:37,005
Stay down. When I tell you,
head for the door.

12
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:39,842
Go.

13
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:24,386
Let's go.

14
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:08,555
You're luggage.

15
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:30,244
<i>How many casualties?</i>

16
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:33,372
Three. Kruger took them
out like that, cold.

17
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:36,542
- I can't believe this.
- His prints were on the weapon.

18
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:41,046
You've run prints on him already?
That's moving fast.

19
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:43,132
I was there. I saw it.

20
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:45,717
Why would he do a thing like this?

21
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:46,969
Look...

22
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:52,141
...the man has nothing to keep him honest.
He's been bought.

23
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:54,226
I've known John for years.

24
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:56,395
We're losing time.

25
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,730
If he's innocent, why's he on the run?

26
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:00,274
And his witness?

27
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:02,067
She's in it with him.

28
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:04,153
What the hell do you mean?

29
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:09,199
We identified ourselves.
She shot one of my men.

30
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:13,245
Fine.

31
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:17,541
Do whatever it takes to bring him in.

32
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,251
Robert?

33
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:21,920
Sir?

34
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:25,215
Bring him in alive.

35
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:33,682
Captain?

36
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:35,768
Put out a citywide APB.

37
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:41,064
Lock this town up so tight
it'll make his balls ache.

38
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,798
Beller.

39
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,966
<i>- Captain.
- John, where are you?</i>

40
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:12,638
DeGuerin is the mole. He killed the others
to flush out my witness.

41
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:13,806
<i>Come in.</i>

42
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:15,307
I must protect my witness!

43
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:18,227
You'll put her in danger.
You'll both end up dead.

44
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:22,064
DeGuerin has been bought.
My witness knows too much.

45
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:26,610
Federal agents say you are the shooter.

46
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:29,488
I'll call you back.

47
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:30,656
<i>When?</i>

48
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:34,118
When I have proof.

49
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,336
It's gone too far.

50
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,380
We're on our own.

51
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,298
What can we do?

52
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:52,511
We can't stay on the run for long.

53
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:56,348
We need some hard evidence.

54
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:12,406
You kept a copy?

55
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:17,161
I was supposed to give it to a friend
of mine, a reporter.

56
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:20,539
- She asked me...
- Claire Isaacs?

57
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,709
How did you know?

58
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,961
She's dead.

59
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,256
They killed her.

60
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,300
How could they have known?

61
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,719
- I didn't tell anyone.
- I know. It's not your fault.

62
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,220
They probably tapped her phone.

63
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:38,724
There are many ways...

64
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:40,684
Everything's going to be all right.

65
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,103
I was just trying to cover myself.

66
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,939
I didn't know who I could trust.

67
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,108
Now, I'll get us both killed.

68
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:49,193
No.

69
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,361
This may be all that keeps us alive.

70
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,489
I don't even know what's on that.

71
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,991
We'll find out.

72
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:58,869
It's completely hacker-proof.

73
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,955
There's no way to run it outside Cyrez.

74
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:05,375
Then we'll run it from the inside.

75
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:10,631
It's like a fortress. We can't go back there.
They'd expect that.

76
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:14,676
I'd hate to disappoint them.

77
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,724
The streets are clear. The police have
returned to the safety of their donut shops.

78
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,976
This is Father Rodriguez.

79
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:24,311
Pleasure.

80
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:26,730
I was not always Father Rodriguez.

81
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,484
I was born again, with a little help
from our friend.

82
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:35,155
His Colombian associates wanted
to introduce him to God personally.

83
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:37,408
I've been given a second chance at life.

84
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:40,327
This time, I'm using it for God's work.

85
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,162
Anything else I can do?

86
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:45,165
We need a car. Just for a day or two.

87
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,250
Done.

88
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,046
It burns as much oil as gas, but it's yours.

89
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,346
You sure about this?

90
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:03,225
There's no one else I can trust.

91
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:26,165
<i>It's raining men,
Hallelujah, it's raining men</i>

92
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,479
Hello, Johnny.

93
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,480
You!

94
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,442
I need to talk to you right away.

95
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:58,113
I've got one question.

96
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:01,575
Was it your idea to hook me up
with the Village People here?

97
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,118
You're safe?

98
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:05,746
From the Mob, yeah.

99
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:10,000
No self-respecting wiseguy
would be caught dead in a joint like this.

100
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,628
Do me just one favor.

101
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:17,007
Don't let on that I'm straight.
I don't want to break any hearts.

102
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,133
Trust me.

103
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:21,929
You said if I ever need anything,
I could come to you.

104
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:24,014
I need your help.

105
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,726
Wait. You need my help?

106
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,019
Now.

107
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,145
You got it.

108
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:33,774
Cover me for a few seconds.
I got to help a friend.

109
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:36,443
Who's he? He looks rough!

110
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:38,028
Don't start.

111
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,949
Do you two need a moment alone?

112
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,784
We're fine, thanks.

113
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:45,536
Just an idea.

114
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:49,665
Kevin just... worries about me.

115
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:52,459
Don't ask.

116
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:57,172
You want me to help you break into Cyrez?

117
00:09:57,423 --> 00:09:58,173
Yeah.

118
00:09:58,424 --> 00:09:59,675
You shitting me?

119
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:02,553
I thought I'd help you move a sofa
or something.

120
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,973
Pull over up ahead.

121
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,516
I'll help you out.

122
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:11,603
All we'll need is some tanks,
a few rocket launchers...

123
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:15,607
...and a set of balls
like the King of Bayonne.

124
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:19,111
All you need are these.

125
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:23,991
I'll meet you at his place.

126
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:30,080
Do I look like I've got gas?

127
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:52,728
Gentlemen.

128
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:54,772
What's going on?

129
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,982
It will be contained in 24 hours.

130
00:10:57,232 --> 00:10:59,234
Not good enough.

131
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,154
We have problems. They're solvable.

132
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:03,864
We must cancel the shipment.

133
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:05,074
Not an option.

134
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:09,495
What do we do with ten tons of assault
weaponry that's not supposed to exist?

135
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:12,289
I am the eyes and ears of your world.

136
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,166
There's too much heat.

137
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,667
You don't get it.

138
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:17,795
The money has changed hands.

139
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:22,758
These are not the kind of people
you cancel on.

140
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:31,016
Get those guns out of the country tonight
or you're dead.

141
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,267
Now...

142
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:35,020
...how will you contain the situation?

143
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,107
Kruger has to show up at Cyrez.
I'll be waiting.

144
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:39,608
Why would he risk it?

145
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:44,279
The disk is the only thing
that'll clear him and the woman.

146
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,823
This better work.

147
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,826
The disk. The girl. The guns.

148
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,787
By dawn, they don't exist. Clear?

149
00:11:52,037 --> 00:11:52,955
Yeah.

150
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:55,207
Crystal.

151
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:58,710
The House Armed Services Committee
announced that in two weeks...

152
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:03,549
...it will begin official hearings
into the Cyrez scandal.

153
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:07,970
It's crawling with reporters.
We've got to keep a lid on this mess.

154
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,850
By tomorrow you'll be chuckling
about this in your kiss-ass country club.

155
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,560
Who's running this camera?

156
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,145
I am.

157
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:18,355
This is James Haggerty, head of security.

158
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,315
Good.

159
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:23,819
We'll keep everything nice and low-profile.

160
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:25,320
Ever do any wetwork?

161
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,322
On three different continents.

162
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,492
To impress me, Slick, do your fucking job.

163
00:12:30,743 --> 00:12:32,327
How many people do you have?

164
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:35,581
Twelve experienced professionals.
They'll do whatever it takes.

165
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:39,501
Plus 20 more on the security force,
who'll follow orders.

166
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:40,753
Fine.

167
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:44,757
Make sure my man
has your full cooperation.

168
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:48,594
We've got every possible point-of-entry
under surveillance...

169
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:50,679
...from the rooftop to the sewers.

170
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:52,014
He's a ghost.

171
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:55,893
If he wants in, he'll get in.
Where's he got to go to run this disk?

172
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:59,271
The central vault.
No other terminal can access it.

173
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:03,692
If he wants to read the disk,
there's only one way in.

174
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:06,111
Outstanding, gentlemen.

175
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:11,825
All we do is sit back and wait
for Mr. Kruger to come to us.

176
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:18,415
Where are you going?

177
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:22,628
Take it easy. I've got a delivery
for Blevens, 14th floor.

178
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,880
We can't accept
any unauthorized deliveries.

179
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,299
"We can't accept any deliveries."

180
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,551
I'm just messing with you, man.

181
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:34,139
Call Blevens to authorize it.
Pepperoni and cheese.

182
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,642
Maybe you don't understand.

183
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,061
This is a high-security facility.

184
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:43,649
You don't understand.
This is a Papa Genoche's pizza.

185
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:47,820
If he doesn't get it while it's still hot,
he gets two free out of my pocket!

186
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,947
- I'm trying to save for a computer.
- Search him.

187
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,450
Get your hands off me!

188
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,952
Listen...

189
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,579
...I got a bad heart and a good lawyer.

190
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,581
Shut up.

191
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:02,543
He's clean.

192
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:06,797
Cheese and pepperoni.

193
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,469
Pal, hit the road.

194
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,472
I said, go!

195
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,358
What's going on?

196
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:29,403
<i>Pizza delivery guy is having a seizure.</i>

197
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:31,029
Who ordered a pizza?

198
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,744
This is all we need. Get him
to the infirmary and call an ambulance.

199
00:14:57,222 --> 00:15:00,058
<i>- How're we doing?
- We'll be on the road in an hour.</i>

200
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:02,352
They need to be rolling
or I need to know why.

201
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:03,854
Yes, sir.

202
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,649
Come on! Let's move it!

203
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,071
They've been expecting you.

204
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,406
Infirmary is straight through
the loading dock.

205
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:15,574
Is the patient stable?

206
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:17,076
I'm not sure. Hurry.

207
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:19,995
Thank you.

208
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:39,681
He looks stable. Give him some oxygen.

209
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:48,607
He's fibrillating! Code Blue!

210
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:51,944
No, it's okay!

211
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:57,825
Gel.

212
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:02,246
Clear!

213
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,126
This way. They're waiting for you.

214
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:11,004
Here we go again. Clear!

215
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:15,509
Increase the voltage.

216
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,804
Let's do it one more time.

217
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:21,723
Let's not.

218
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:23,934
You, over there, against the wall.

219
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,644
On the floor.

220
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:28,147
Face the wall.

221
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:29,314
On the floor.

222
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:30,816
My God! Terrorists!

223
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,985
You want terror?

224
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:35,654
You want some freaking terror?

225
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:37,448
I'll jump-start your ass!

226
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:39,283
Tape them up.

227
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,327
Face the wall!

228
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,582
Keep the room secure.

229
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:48,083
Can you handle that?

230
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,253
Get out of here!

231
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:55,466
Let's go.

232
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:02,806
We have a problem.

233
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,309
What is it?

234
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,519
- He's running the disk.
- Shit!

235
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,854
Impossible.

236
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:11,356
Any activity at Station 1?

237
00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:12,858
<i>All clear.</i>

238
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:16,111
My ass! He's in.
He just didn't use the door.

239
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:20,157
Get your men down there, now! Go!

240
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:43,222
- What are you doing?
- No, I know this.

241
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:44,389
We change it every week.

242
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,602
Screw that. Get out of the way.

243
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:53,023
Check it.

244
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,249
Somebody talk to me.

245
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:15,462
He must be at a remote terminal
somewhere in the building.

246
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:18,882
- You said he couldn't.
- He can't.

247
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:21,760
Donahue designed it
so no outside activity...

248
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,096
Donahue is dead.

249
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:28,100
You'll wish you were too,
if you don't find out what's going on...

250
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,269
...and you find out now.

251
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,604
- Holster your weapon.
- Take a hike, junior.

252
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:36,316
I said, holster your...

253
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:44,283
Some people take things for granted,
like the ability to chew solid food.

254
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:47,327
I can find him.

255
00:18:47,953 --> 00:18:49,121
How?

256
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:52,624
I'll scan the terminals,
eliminate them one by one.

257
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,627
If he stays on-line, I'll nail him.

258
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:58,380
Do it.

259
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:00,174
How're we doing?

260
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:03,761
You were right.
Donahue left himself a back door.

261
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:07,765
But we still have to break his code.

262
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:13,645
We've got another five or six minutes
until they trace us.

263
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:16,023
Recognize any of this?

264
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:16,857
No.

265
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:19,359
We're getting warm.
It's an accounting format.

266
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,155
Stop me if I get lucky.

267
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:25,532
How're we doing?

268
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:27,785
Eliminating low-clearance programs.

269
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:29,661
South wing is clean.

270
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:30,871
Two to go.

271
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:34,708
Two federal investigators downstairs
want to talk.

272
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,795
Do what you've got to do,
but get rid of them.

273
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:42,132
- You can't be seen here.
- I won't be. Go.

274
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:45,052
I need a chopper on the roof.

275
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:47,805
Right.

276
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:50,015
Those are offshore banking deposits.

277
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:52,684
"UBS." That's United Bank of Syria.

278
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:55,562
$52 million.

279
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:58,315
If it's an arms sale, it's a major one.

280
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:02,069
Let's see who their buyer is.

281
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:04,571
"Sergei...

282
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:06,949
...Ivanovich Petrotsky."

283
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:08,409
Who's that?

284
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,828
Bad news.

285
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:13,247
He heads a cartel in the Russian Mafia...

286
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:19,002
...selling drugs, guns and influence
to very unpleasant people.

287
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:23,715
He's in the north wing.

288
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,426
Get moving.

289
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:27,553
Let's go.

290
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:29,054
- How much longer?
- I don't know.

291
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:33,642
Fifteen terminals are running
secure programs.

292
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:37,229
You got five minutes.
Find them and call me.

293
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:40,357
Let's go.

294
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:43,610
There it is. Delivery date...

295
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:45,362
...tonight, midnight.

296
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,781
1,000 units for delivery
at Baltimore Harbor.

297
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:51,076
1,000 units of what?

298
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:59,293
1,000 E.M. Guns.

299
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:02,796
Are they insane? If these get offshore...

300
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:07,676
There will be a whole new era
of world terrorism.

301
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:14,266
Got him. Twenty-fifth floor,
Donahue's office.

302
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:18,771
Scramble. Alpha Chief
to the north wing, now!

303
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:22,149
They're on to us.

304
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:26,111
They're erasing the goddamn disk.

305
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:05,692
Come on!

306
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:19,832
I'll cover you. Meet me at the ambulance.

307
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:22,668
Go!

308
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:36,306
Lee, run!

309
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:48,485
Listen, John!

310
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:50,988
My rules now!

311
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:56,952
Mess with me, I'll slice her up
and mail her back to you in little pieces.

312
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:11,216
<i>Fire alert.</i>

313
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:12,509
<i>Fire alert.</i>

314
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,056
<i>This is not a drill. Please proceed
to the nearest exit.</i>

315
00:23:49,254 --> 00:23:52,174
In this car I can get us to Baltimore
in 40 minutes.

316
00:23:52,424 --> 00:23:54,510
You're not coming with me.

317
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,470
I'll drop you off.

318
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,972
Don't give me this, "I work alone" shit.

319
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:02,518
You've already done enough.
This is not your fight.

320
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:06,355
Look, just indulge me for a minute, okay?

321
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:08,190
If it weren't for you...

322
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,694
...my tongue would be hanging
on Canelli's trophy wall.

323
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:16,240
Look, you need me.

324
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,826
My cousin Tony runs those docks.

325
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:23,288
If your ship is there, he will find it.

326
00:24:46,603 --> 00:24:48,063
You're short one envelope.

327
00:24:48,313 --> 00:24:50,232
Infantino didn't pay.

328
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:52,901
What do you mean he didn't pay?

329
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:54,153
What'd he say?

330
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:57,072
He said, "Tell that fat fuck,
Tony Two-toes...

331
00:24:57,322 --> 00:24:59,908
...I ain't paying him another dime."

332
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,869
I know that voice.

333
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,205
But it can't be him.

334
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:09,168
Not unless he's a ghost.

335
00:25:11,336 --> 00:25:12,921
Boo.

336
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:15,257
Johnny C.!

337
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:17,384
You got whacked!

338
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:20,053
Must have been another guy.

339
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:22,765
Another guy rat on Canelli too?

340
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:24,767
Canelli's a piece of shit.

341
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:28,395
I got no love for Canelli, either.

342
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:31,231
But...

343
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,569
...this time you went over the line.

344
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:37,905
I'm still here.

345
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:40,282
What you did was wrong.

346
00:25:40,532 --> 00:25:45,537
He got a drug dealer and his poison
off the streets.

347
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:48,290
Who's the tree trunk?

348
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,793
This is the guy who saved my ass.

349
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:52,961
This is my cousin, Tony Two-toes.

350
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,923
That's Sal.

351
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:57,591
Little Mike.

352
00:25:57,841 --> 00:26:00,594
Your funeral was absolutely beautiful.

353
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:03,097
Canelli finds out he's still breathing...

354
00:26:03,347 --> 00:26:06,642
Screw Canelli. We got bigger problems.
Tell him.

355
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:09,144
There's a major arms deal going down.

356
00:26:09,394 --> 00:26:14,400
A US contractor's selling out
to international terrorists.

357
00:26:17,986 --> 00:26:21,490
"Mr. 60 Minutes." Tell me something
I don't know.

358
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,953
It will happen tonight on your docks.

359
00:26:26,703 --> 00:26:30,040
That I didn't know.

360
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:36,338
Quite a lot of security.

361
00:26:36,588 --> 00:26:38,841
Expecting trouble?

362
00:26:39,091 --> 00:26:41,135
I'm a Boy Scout. "Always be prepared."

363
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:43,846
Is that why she's here?

364
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,765
Just think of her as an insurance policy...

365
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:49,852
...in case someone crashes the party.

366
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:51,854
You're not telling me something.

367
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:56,525
Just a bump in the carpet.
Nothing for you to worry about.

368
00:26:56,775 --> 00:27:00,195
Relax. You'll be out of here in 20 minutes.

369
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:02,865
What do I do with her?

370
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:04,366
Whatever you want.

371
00:27:04,616 --> 00:27:07,494
Once you're in international waters,
her policy expires.

372
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:09,204
Personally...

373
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:14,209
...I'd put a bullet in her head
and throw her overboard.

374
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:16,170
It would be such a shame.

375
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,798
Don't even think about it.

376
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:27,431
I think and do what I like.
You will soon learn about this.

377
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:30,684
Last crate's on its way.

378
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:34,521
I'll leave you lovebirds alone.

379
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:39,068
DeGuerin...

380
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:51,080
This is Kruger. Get me Beller.

381
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:54,750
Start a trace on this.

382
00:27:58,003 --> 00:28:01,632
I've got proof Cyrez is selling weapons
on the black market.

383
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:03,300
Daniel Harper's in on it.

384
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,761
Undersecretary of Defense Harper?

385
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:08,305
Yes. DeGuerin is their facilitator.

386
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:11,141
<i>He is the mole. It all goes down tonight.</i>

387
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:13,811
Come and get me. Baltimore docks.

388
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:16,897
Pier 57.

389
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:41,338
Report.

390
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:42,840
Range is clear.

391
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,468
Not a creature is stirring.

392
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,724
<i>Clear on the south.</i>

393
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,518
Quiet on the east.

394
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:56,937
Listen up. This is the last load.

395
00:28:57,187 --> 00:29:00,023
Keep your heads up
and your assholes puckered.

396
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:04,653
If that son of a bitch is out there,
I want him.

397
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:09,366
Sunshine...

398
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:11,368
I want to talk to you.

399
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:13,662
This is a restricted area.

400
00:29:13,912 --> 00:29:17,583
You're telling me.
What the hell are you doing here?

401
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:18,709
Excuse me?

402
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:21,211
We're from Local 129, sonny.

403
00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:26,216
We heard you was loading a ship without
the assistance of bona fide union labor.

404
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:28,469
Say it ain't so.

405
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,387
Sir, we have a situation.

406
00:29:30,637 --> 00:29:32,055
You certainly do.

407
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:35,851
Stand by. We're coming to you.

408
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:43,859
What's going on?

409
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:46,070
Let me explain something to you.

410
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,741
Nothing moves off these docks
without it getting loaded by the union.

411
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:53,702
I don't see no union people around here.

412
00:29:53,952 --> 00:29:54,703
Do you?

413
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:59,083
This is a matter of national security.
Clear this area immediately!

414
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,709
Are you threatening us?

415
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:03,921
Absolutely.

416
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:17,768
What was that?

417
00:30:18,018 --> 00:30:21,313
Gunfire at the warehouse!

418
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,197
Nobody screws with the union.

419
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,286
Perimeter, check in.

420
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:37,913
Talk to me!

421
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:39,623
We have a security breach.

422
00:30:39,873 --> 00:30:43,752
Check it out! Get that crane moving!

423
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:41,894
Movement in the southwest corner
of the warehouse.

424
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:45,355
It's nothing.

425
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:52,696
There they are.

426
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:54,198
Commie bastards.

427
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:59,203
Not Communists. They're a federation
of independent, liberated states.

428
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:01,622
Don't make me hurt you, Mikey.

429
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:03,999
Keep your eyes on the guys on that crane.

430
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:08,003
Think I can hit that guy from here?

431
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:14,384
You're lucky if you hit the floor
if you fell on it.

432
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:18,972
<i>Got him.</i>

433
00:32:19,223 --> 00:32:20,057
Thirty yards.

434
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:23,227
Fry the bastard.

435
00:32:29,358 --> 00:32:32,236
Jesus Christ.

436
00:32:51,046 --> 00:32:53,882
Fuck me!

437
00:32:57,469 --> 00:32:59,096
I think we got him!

438
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:01,306
He's toast!

439
00:33:01,557 --> 00:33:03,434
I think we even got the roaches.

440
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:05,644
Royce, Somes, you're recon.

441
00:33:05,894 --> 00:33:07,813
Bring me back the good news.

442
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:09,982
E.M. Team, cover them.

443
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:12,943
Roger.

444
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:46,560
Come on, goddamn it.

445
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:19,843
Nice shotgun, asshole.

446
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:58,942
Schiff! Calderon!

447
00:35:59,902 --> 00:36:02,863
They missed.

448
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:05,824
Johnny?

449
00:36:06,075 --> 00:36:09,286
I'll be right out.

450
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:13,499
Open fire!

451
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,681
It looks as if your friend has arrived.

452
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:31,934
I'll enjoy introducing him to you.

453
00:36:32,184 --> 00:36:37,272
I won't have the pleasure.
He's forced me to hasten our departure.

454
00:36:37,523 --> 00:36:40,442
And yours.

455
00:38:01,982 --> 00:38:03,233
Goddamn it!

456
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:07,112
Now you are pissing me off!

457
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:10,449
Drop the guns.

458
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:14,036
Now.

459
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:25,005
Thanks.

460
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:27,800
Shut up!

461
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:31,261
Take it up! Now!

462
00:40:38,472 --> 00:40:42,017
Here. Grab the ladder.

463
00:40:47,064 --> 00:40:48,982
Hold on.

464
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:52,569
Say good-bye, John.

465
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:57,866
Good-bye.

466
00:41:41,076 --> 00:41:44,079
John, buddy!

467
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:47,750
Don't let me go like this.

468
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,669
Help me!

469
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,187
Son of a bitch!

470
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:12,399
Drop the gun!

471
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:50,562
Get him out of here!

472
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:03,867
Thank you, John.

473
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,705
Ready?

474
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:11,834
Let's go!

475
00:43:43,532 --> 00:43:46,535
How does it feel to be indicted for treason?

476
00:43:46,785 --> 00:43:48,036
He has nothing to say.

477
00:43:48,287 --> 00:43:51,373
Marshal DeGuerin! What about you?

478
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:52,791
I'm proud.

479
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:54,376
You admit to treason?

480
00:43:54,626 --> 00:43:57,129
I admit to patriotism.

481
00:43:57,379 --> 00:43:59,465
Our actions stopped a secret alliance...

482
00:43:59,715 --> 00:44:04,052
...this administration has had
with some of our worst enemies.

483
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:06,555
The public deserves to know the truth.

484
00:44:06,805 --> 00:44:10,893
When we have our day in court, they will.

485
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:14,730
They could get away with this.

486
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,442
If Morehart takes the fall.

487
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:23,030
You did well.

488
00:44:23,238 --> 00:44:27,367
I couldn't have done it without you.

489
00:44:27,993 --> 00:44:30,746
Ready?

490
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,422
Pretty impressive speech.

491
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:44,176
Learn to keep your mouth shut
in front of the press.

492
00:44:44,426 --> 00:44:47,721
It doesn't matter, anyway.

493
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:52,976
This will never go to trial
without her testimony.

494
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:48,115
I'm not sure we should start again.

495
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:49,032
Why not?

496
00:45:49,283 --> 00:45:52,786
With this bitch gone,
we can spin-doctor ourselves clean.

497
00:45:53,036 --> 00:45:56,123
What if she's been in contact
with her friends, her family?

498
00:45:56,373 --> 00:45:58,125
Fuck her family and friends.

499
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:00,627
I'll kill them one by one.

500
00:46:00,878 --> 00:46:02,796
Next year, she won't even be a memory.

501
00:46:03,046 --> 00:46:05,299
Robert, you never fail to amaze me.

502
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:07,551
Me? Thank you.

503
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:10,304
But I got to hand it to you, Danny.

504
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:13,724
That was brilliant work back there.

505
00:46:13,974 --> 00:46:15,309
What?

506
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:16,643
The van.

507
00:46:16,894 --> 00:46:19,396
It was beautiful, clean, swift.

508
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:22,316
There were witnesses to say
we were never near it.

509
00:46:22,566 --> 00:46:23,817
I like your style.

510
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:26,236
You know, you remind me of me.

511
00:46:26,487 --> 00:46:28,155
I thought you set that up.

512
00:46:28,405 --> 00:46:31,366
Didn't you...

513
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:35,621
What the hell's going on?

514
00:46:36,747 --> 00:46:39,458
What is it?

515
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,933
Hello?

516
00:46:57,768 --> 00:47:00,646
It's for you.

517
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:08,570
<i>You've just been erased.</i>

518
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,376
Oh, my God!

519
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:24,294
Let me out!

520
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:25,462
Break it!

521
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:28,507
Get off of me!

522
00:47:58,162 --> 00:48:00,956
What happened?

523
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:07,296
They caught a train.
