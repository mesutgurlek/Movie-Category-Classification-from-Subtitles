00:00:57,603 --> 00:01:01,092
<i>Now, Bernie, this is seriously, now,
this is where they asked us to meet?

3
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,070
<i>- Yeah, whaddya mean?
- Oh, I think I see her.

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,250
<i>- Where?
- Oh, that's gotta be her.

5
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:09,462
<i>All right, so,
what are we gonna do?

6
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:12,232
<i>Are we gonna grab a milkshake,
Buddy, is that why we're here?

7
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,247
<i>Yeah, all right, I guess.

8
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:17,655
<i>All right, you're
gonna owe me big for this.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,520
- You think I shoulda worn the other shirt?
- You look nice.

10
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:47,161
I don't know, Gus, maybe she... what if she
don't like the look of me or somethin'?

11
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:52,106
Bernie, c'mon, are you sure,
are you serious? What about her?

12
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:54,629
Aren't you dyin'
to see what she looks like?

13
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:57,324
<i>- She could be a dog.</i>
- No, she isn't a dog.

14
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:58,595
She could be.

15
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:01,373
I already know what she looks like
like, c'mon, Ed, she isn't a dog.

16
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:07,142
You've been talkin' to her
for weeks on the phone, right?

17
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:08,507
- Yeah.
- Right?

18
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,777
Yeah.

19
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:17,410
She likes ya,
from talkin' to ya, Bernie.

20
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,547
And I don't think ya gotta worry about
her gettin' a good look at ya...

21
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,477
that ain't never been your problem.

22
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:26,627
Let's go.

23
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,252
<i>Come on.

24
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,718
I shoulda worn the other shirt.

25
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:46,246
I'm the one takin' the risk.

26
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:50,138
doublin' with some girl I never
even spoke to, let alone seen.

27
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:53,819
I don't know why this Miriam broad
says it's gotta be a double date anyway.

28
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,328
Maybe she's not sure about me yet.

29
00:02:56,378 --> 00:03:00,340
- How can anybody not be sure about you, Bernie?
- Yeah, thanks, Gus.

30
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,660
Yeah, hey, don't tell the other guys
down at the station about this.

31
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,890
It's not like you never
been on a date before.

32
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,447
<i>All set there?

33
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:15,104
<i>Excuse me,</i> are you Miriam?

34
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,367
No, <i>I'm her friend.

35
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:22,234
She's...

36
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:31,898
<i>Hi, how ya doin', I'm Gus?
- Catherine.

37
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,107
We'll talk again.

38
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:40,455
Bye.

39
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,706
Hi.

40
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:04,978
Wait.

41
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:08,410
You are Bernie Webber, right?

42
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:12,215
Yeah, yeah, I'm Bernie.

43
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:15,502
<i>Hey, you two,
let's go grab drink.

44
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:20,566
- You wanna go?
- Sure.

45
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,275
How ya doin'?

46
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,559
- I'm Gus.
- Ya know...

47
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:29,984
For a minute there I thought it was Smokey
the Bear makin' a call in that booth.

48
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:33,999
'Cause of your jacket.

49
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:50,324
Miriam's never been on a boat.

50
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:53,006
- She's scared of the water.
- Has she never?

51
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:55,815
I told her I don't know how<i> she's
gonna date a guy in the Coast Guard.

52
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:58,069
I'm not scared,
I live on the Cape.

53
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:01,753
Don't worry, Miriam, ya know, we...
we all get scared out there.

54
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:03,648
I'm not afraid of the water, Bernie.

55
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:07,602
It scares me at night,
that's all, ya know.

56
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:09,972
Ya can't see
what's underneath.

57
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:13,804
Just more water.

58
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:25,729
Ya know, I... I get funnier
as the night goes on.

59
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:28,723
So, well, why... why did you want
to meet me for a date? Wha...

60
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,801
Why did you wait so long?

61
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,696
I didn't know if you'd be a...

62
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,063
If... if I what?

63
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:42,539
- You know.
- No.

64
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:47,940
You are so handsome, I just didn't
know if you'd be attracted to me.

65
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:51,696
Oh, God, no, Miriam,
you're exactly how I pictured you.

66
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:54,653
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

67
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:56,983
Better.

68
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,815
You know what, my... my brother he
always says when you know, you just know.

69
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,231
- Which one?
- All of it, I guess everything.

70
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,979
- No, I mean which brother.
- Oh.

71
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:15,438
Paul, my brother Paul.

72
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,166
He's the one who fought over in Germany?
- In Germany, yeah.

73
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:20,477
He's the oldest,
father's favorite.

74
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:22,627
All three<i> of my brothers
went over to the war.

75
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:24,188
Is your father's...?

76
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:33,987
We should get Miriam out on a boat<i> tonight,
whaddya say, Buddy.

77
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:37,672
<i>We take out the dory,
gonna</i> be fantastic.

78
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,899
You know we can't do that,
Gus, we can get in trouble.

79
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,680
- Come on, Bernie, it'll be fun.
- Rules are rules.

80
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:46,142
No, we... we...
we don't gotta row out far.

81
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:49,278
Just as so this sweet girl can say
she's been on a boat.

82
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,745
A row boat? No!

83
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:55,287
No, no, no, small boats are...

84
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:03,029
How about one of those bigger boats...
tied up to the dock.

85
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,905
- If Bernie's with me, I'll do it.
<i>- Old fishing boat?

86
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:11,608
<i>Those fishermen don't want us around,
unless we're pullin' 'em in.

87
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,877
They think they own the God damned water.
<i>They're not very nice.

88
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:19,173
- C'mon, don't be such a fathead, Miriam.
- Yeah.

89
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:22,759
Let's go out on the dory,
what's there to be afraid of?

90
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,370
What's underneath, right?

91
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,454
Hey, Mr. Stello, how's it goin'?

92
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:44,757
- Hey, Bernie.
- Mr. Ryder.

93
00:07:45,737 --> 00:07:49,241
Hey, so you see that...
see that girl standin' over there?

94
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:53,064
The one with the coat,
looks like a bear bunny?

95
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,762
- Yeah.
- Can't miss her.

96
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:57,621
I said the same thing myself,
funny you should say that, yeah.

97
00:07:57,623 --> 00:08:00,072
Looks like Smokey, right?
Smokey the Bear?

98
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:02,162
I don't know no Smokey, Bernie.

99
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:03,864
It's... it's just a cartoon.

100
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:08,434
Anyway Mr. Stello, she... she thinks
she's scared of<i> goin' out on a boat.

101
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:10,870
And I don't think we
should row out on a dory,

102
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,080
I don't want to get her
sick on that nice big coat.

103
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,999
<i>So I was wondering if...

104
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:17,570
So, you wanna take her on
the Anna G around the harbor?

105
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:19,086
Yeah.

106
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,446
<i>Can't row out on that dory,</i>
even if you wanted, right, Bernie?

107
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:23,730
Carl, stop.

108
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:27,643
<i>Year anniversary's coming,</i>
my sister's now livin' in my house.

109
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:31,457
How's it goin' with you, Bernie?

110
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,871
<i>That's enough, Carl,
he did all he could.

111
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:38,525
I AM sorry, Mr. Nickerson.

112
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:43,131
<i>I didn't mean to upset you, just wanted
to ask Mr. Stello</i> about borrowin' a boat.

113
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:47,109
Gotcha! Gotcha!

114
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,482
Give me your hands.

115
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:57,536
It's okay.

116
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:51,065
Just follow my arms, okay?

117
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:52,749
Stay with me.

118
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:56,347
It's all about...
it's all about the rhythm.

119
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:59,825
Okay? So, it's... so, it's,
here we go.

120
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:03,803
One two three,
right left right.

121
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:10,832
I count one two three...

122
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,461
- Let's just sit down, Bernie?
- No, Sweetheart,

123
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,109
Look, all ya...
all ya gotta do is...

124
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:18,036
ya gotta relax and be patient
and settle in my hand.

125
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:22,312
Hey, look, just, here,
settle in my hand, ya feel that?

126
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,470
Just, listen to the music.

127
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,662
You're doing great.

128
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:00,133
Will you marry me?

129
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:05,625
What?

130
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,330
Will you marry me?

131
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:14,696
No.

132
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:36,594
Miriam, hold on.

133
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:49,646
It's cold, Sweetheart,
don't ya wanna go back inside?

134
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:54,408
The... the band's not through.

135
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:03,401
It's cold, ya feel that?
There's a storm coming.

136
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:12,156
Okay.

137
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:15,109
Okay, what?

138
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:18,720
Okay, let's get married,
I just... I don't wanna...

139
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:19,823
Wanna what?

140
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:26,217
Well, it's only been a few
months and it's still winter after all,

141
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:28,465
and... and... look, ya know,
there... there's a storm comin'

142
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,381
it's just like this one
come through last year.

143
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,720
What does that...

144
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,023
I heard it's gonna miss us.

145
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,205
Yeah, but maybe not, ya never know.

146
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,325
Ya never know.

147
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:44,991
There's some people just...
they're just not cut out for... for this.

148
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:47,356
Sometimes ya go out
and ya don't come back.

149
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,716
Are you talkin' about
the storm, or marriage, Bernie?

150
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:54,501
I think I'm talking about the storm, right?.

151
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,824
You're scared of a storm?

152
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,308
No.

153
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:05,808
I don't wanna disappoint nobody.

154
00:13:07,263 --> 00:13:09,160
And...

155
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,541
I don't wanna you,
I love you.

156
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:14,847
So...

157
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,226
yeah, let's get married.

158
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:26,063
You sure?

159
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:28,012
Oh, yeah.

160
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:32,164
When?

161
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:35,997
You want me to pick a date?
No, when... when do you wanna get married.

162
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,582
- April 16th.
- Okay.

163
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,835
Okay, April 16th it is.

164
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:45,320
But... but I... but I... I gotta
ask permission from Cluff first.

165
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,815
Ya gotta ask permission?

166
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:50,022
Yeah, it's... it's from my commander,
it's Coast Guard regulation.

167
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:52,259
But, promise, I'll ask him tomorrow.

168
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:54,503
Okay, Bernie.

169
00:13:57,659 --> 00:13:59,260
Let's get goin'.

170
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,896
Then you can dance.

171
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:13,782
Hon, look at that,
it's already startin' t'snow.

172
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,869
Can you hear me over this hummin', Captain?

173
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:58,712
That fracture they went over last month is
not gonna hold it in these seas, Captain,

174
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,227
it takes a bad jolt it
could fracture again.

175
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:06,635
I'll have to go and check,
I can hear it from right down here.

176
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:08,213
<i>The whales is really hummin'.

177
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:12,969
<i>I ain't topping, Sir,
the whales is...</i> hummin'.

178
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,787
I'd like to take it down
to three knots please.

179
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:23,258
If we don't slow down, Captain,
we might not have a...

180
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:26,322
position to hold.

181
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,029
No problem, Cap'n.

182
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,644
Holdin' at seven knots,
thank you, Sir.

183
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:46,982
- Hey, Pop?
- I hear it.

184
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:52,383
Ya wanna go up on deck have a look at
those crack clusters holdin' that weld together?

185
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:55,276
You might as well go get a hat, Papo.

186
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:56,960
What did he say?

187
00:15:57,237 --> 00:16:00,513
He says he'd like you to
consider taking a hat with ya, that's all.

188
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:17,290
Get some sleep.

189
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:25,319
Whaddya know about this weather,
it's killin' me and young Eldon here?

190
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:28,808
Tiny, ya sure it's the weather?
Maybe it's your singin'.

191
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:34,727
Come on.

192
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:40,917
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

193
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:51,800
It's gonna get worse.

194
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:08,042
I didn't make it top side!
<i>That weld can't hold in these seas!

195
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,047
<i>Ya gotta slow her down.

196
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,491
I'm callin' the Captain back.

197
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,367
<i>It's comin' in!

198
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,627
- It'll keep up?
- Yeah.

199
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,879
We've got a hull fracture
in the engine room!

200
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:18,234
<i>All hands! Muster mattresses,</i> blankets,
whatever you can get your hands yet.

201
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:31,238
Yeah, Bernie?

202
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,909
I can't get anyone on the bridge.

203
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:37,459
I need to go up and tell the Captain
<i>we got an eighteen foot fracture in our hull.

204
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:40,791
Tell him these pumps are holdin' for now,
but we don't put her to port, we're gonna wreck.

205
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:42,577
The Cap'n don't understand me, Balou.

206
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,529
I know he can't understand you,
he don't listen to anyone anyway.

207
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:21,052
Cold out today?
- Yeah.

208
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:24,890
- Ya still tryin' to fix that darn thing?
- Yeah.

209
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,739
Ah, c'mon, Fitzy,
it's useless.

210
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:28,932
Let the guy who fixes
it to come fix it.

211
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:30,980
I would if he would show up.

212
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:32,985
What's this on the radio,
a ship breakin' up?

213
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,992
Reiss at Fort Mercer.

214
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:38,908
- Fort... Fort Mercer?
- She's a big lady, she's a T2 tanker.

215
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,786
<i>Started radioin' a couple of hours ago,
apparently</i> she's got a big crack in her hull,

216
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:45,287
it's spillin' oil all over the place.

217
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,165
<i>She's about 20 miles east,
off of Nantucket.

218
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:51,142
It sounds like Boston and<i> Nantucket
are sendin' out their entire fleet.

219
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:52,849
<i>We could be next.

220
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:57,341
They're saying gale force winds,
50 to 60 miles per hour.

221
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,425
She's gonna be a mess.

222
00:21:11,055 --> 00:21:12,856
Miriam called for ya.

223
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:14,872
Yeah.

224
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,692
Good luck, Pal.

225
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:22,553
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Mr. Cluff.

226
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:25,289
It's me, Bernie, Sir.

227
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:32,077
Take yourself a crew, go out there help them
fishermen secure their boats to the pier.

228
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:34,067
Aye, yes, Sir.

229
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:37,219
<i>Sir, I need to...
need t'ask you a question,

230
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:41,439
I need permission 'bout a...
'bout a girl

231
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,292
Permission, permission...
for a girl?

232
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:45,978
<i>Fuck this guy, it's workin'.

233
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,288
- Yes, sir.
- Not now, Webber.

234
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:52,423
But, no, Sir, it... it's... it's not...
it's not just some girl, Sir.

235
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:53,998
Not now, Webber.

236
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:57,005
We're back up.

237
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,622
Cluster here is the Mercer Rescue, right?

238
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:02,537
This here other pip,
two miles from here...

239
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:04,942
We must still be gettin'
phantom echoes.

240
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,368
How we suppose to tell
when 'n' if it is out there?

241
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,793
When's that technician comin', Fitzpatrick,
and where the hell's Chief Bangs?

242
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:14,408
It's "Fitzgerald", Sir.

243
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:16,863
Chief Bangs is in the mess hall, Sir.

244
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,310
You makin' fun of<i> accent
'cause I'm not from around here?

245
00:22:23,312 --> 00:22:24,879
No, Mr. Cluff.

246
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:30,306
- Why are you still standin' here, Webber?
- Sir, but...

247
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:33,196
<i>Take Livesey here with ya,</i>
go up top them fishin' boats.

248
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,539
- Yes, sir.
- Ya want me to go with Webber, Sir,

249
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:38,058
to secure fishing boats?

250
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:43,870
You didn't hear me, Livesey, I...
yeah, you with Webber.

251
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:54,310
Sorry, Rich, his orders, ya know.

252
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:14,081
That's enough time, whaddya think?

253
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:17,379
We're takin' on water inside,
we gotta launch some lifeboats.

254
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:18,980
You're such a jackass, Brown.

255
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:22,117
The least we can do, pray for
the Captain, Chief Collagen,

256
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,175
the rest of them men,
all good men.

257
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:26,448
Hey, ain't we good men, Quirey?

258
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:29,730
<i>Don't get me wrong, </i>
prayin's great, but it ain't everything.

259
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:32,304
We need to actually do something.

260
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:43,524
A word.

261
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:47,466
That hothead Brown,
he wants to launch the lifeboats.

262
00:23:47,568 --> 00:23:49,956
- The lifeboats?
- Quirey, he wants to do nothin'.

263
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:52,676
And between them, the two of them
are getting the men worked up.

264
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:04,302
I figure that you know the boat better than
anybody, you're practically married to it, so...

265
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,402
- I think they'll listen to ya.
- Listen to me?

266
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:10,122
Half those men don't like me.

267
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,702
Nobody on the ship likes me,
me and Tchuda.

268
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:16,169
They might not like ya,
but they'll never listen t'ya.

269
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:45,495
We don't know if the
Captain got off an SOS.

270
00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:48,329
<i>The radio room's gone,
we can't</i> call nobody.

271
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:52,139
Now it's just... just<i> Garcia over here with
a little shortwave trying</i> to pick up chatter.

272
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,755
I mean, as far as we know,
nobody even knows we're out here.

273
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:59,612
Now, I'm sayin' we launch some lifeboats
now and get off this ship while you can.

274
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:01,763
How you gonna get
'em down in the water in this storm?

275
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:05,693
It can't be done, those boats are
too small, it's suicide, Brown.

276
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,328
You can't do this,
you can' do dat,

277
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:10,005
whaddya want us to do, Quirey,
just sit up here, do nothing?

278
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:13,594
<i>That's it, no officers, no orders,</i>
every man for himself.

279
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,070
That ain't the way, Brown.

280
00:25:15,554 --> 00:25:17,750
<i>That never did nothin' for nobody.

281
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:20,336
<i>Now, the ship's split,

282
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:22,444
but the bulkheads separating
tanks eight and nine,

283
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:25,826
Now, <i>Mr. Sybert says the other tanks</i>
aren't fractured, so...

284
00:25:25,997 --> 00:25:28,097
the air in the ballast tanks
should keep us afloat.

285
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:33,259
<i>- But, Mr. Sybert also says...</i>
- Mr. Sybert says this, <i>Mr. Sybert says that,

286
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:35,928
he's a big boy, let him say
it himself, he's right here.

287
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,794
G'ahead.

288
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,231
We're sinkin'.

289
00:25:49,704 --> 00:25:51,512
<i>Yeah, but the whistle works.

290
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:56,370
So, we should keep blowin' that,
maybe somebody'll hear it.

291
00:25:57,742 --> 00:26:00,584
I don't know, but we're definitely sinking.

292
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:04,140
The crack in the engine room
is takin' on too much water,

293
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:08,480
the pumps can't keep up.

294
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:12,401
If the water reaches the air intake in
the engine, we're gonna lose all the power.

295
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:16,359
If we lose all the power, we lose the
pumps, and if we lose the pumps...

296
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,573
she's gonna drop pretty quick.

297
00:26:18,672 --> 00:26:21,331
How long have we got
before that happens?

298
00:26:23,237 --> 00:26:25,419
Four, maybe five hours.

299
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,281
Well, we need to buy
ourselves some time.

300
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:32,054
So somebody can find us.

301
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,800
If anybody's even lookin'.

302
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,778
<i>Even if they do know we're
here, </i> the sea is big enough.

303
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:40,152
I mean it'd rip this thing in half.

304
00:26:40,342 --> 00:26:42,105
How the hell we gonna get out?

305
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:44,789
That's why I'm sayin' we
gotta launch some lifeboats.

306
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:48,098
- Our luck's runnin' out.
- I don't believe in luck, Brown.

307
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:52,231
Put those lifeboats in those
seas, they won't last 12 seconds.

308
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:55,047
You and Quirey both you just
wanna sit around and do nothin'.

309
00:26:55,149 --> 00:26:59,198
You got a better idea, Sybert,
or you just go back hide down below?

310
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:08,605
We'll run her aground.

311
00:27:09,304 --> 00:27:10,519
Do what?

312
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,769
We're gonna run her aground, Sybert?

313
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:15,358
<i>Even if you could with
half a ship, why would you?

314
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:18,223
Just break apart,
dump us all out in the sea.

315
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:21,668
<i>It's our only choice,</i> we're gonna
find a soft shoal and we'll lay 'er up,

316
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,573
slow the water that's comin' in,

317
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,529
stay in the same spot,
we'll blow the whistle,

318
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:28,193
we'll give whoever's comin'
to look for us a chance to find us.

319
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:30,729
We're gonna steer a
ship without hydraulics?

320
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,609
That's your plan?
How's that gonna work?

321
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:35,720
I'll build a manual tiller.

322
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:37,784
<i>Hey, Sybert, why should
we even listen to you?

323
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:40,498
The only thing you ever cared about was
this ship, ya know, I'll tell you what...

324
00:27:40,548 --> 00:27:42,402
You two make a cute couple at
the bottom from the ocean.

325
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:44,665
Me? I'm gonna get onto a lifeboat.

326
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,391
Look.

327
00:27:48,676 --> 00:27:51,892
We'll insert a steel beam
into the steering quadrant.

328
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:55,946
We'll put pulleys on the
end of it for leverage...

329
00:27:58,091 --> 00:28:00,085
and then we'll move 'er manually.

330
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,598
Excuse me.

331
00:28:07,904 --> 00:28:09,785
I think I got the radio working.

332
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:18,664
<I>Bearing 83 degrees true, 27 miles from Pollack
Rip Light, about 20 miles east of Nantucket.

333
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:21,484
East of Nantucket?
That ain't the Pendleton.

334
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:24,669
<i>- Fort Mercer's emergency...</i>
- Fort Mercer, that's another T2.

335
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:28,192
Another tanker split in two.

336
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,096
But if everyone's gonna
help them, who's gonna...

337
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:33,295
who's gonna come for us?

338
00:28:37,331 --> 00:28:39,740
How you feelin'?
You all right?

339
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:44,295
- Did you... did you ask Cluff yet?
- No.

340
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:45,182
Why didn't you ask him?

341
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:46,290
<i>- Hey, Webber!</i>
- What's wrong with you?

342
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:48,014
- I think I got one more...
<i>- Webber!

343
00:28:48,284 --> 00:28:51,322
- What?
- You asked him yet, you ask Cluff?

344
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:55,010
I told you not to tell nobody.

345
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:58,117
- I'm sorry, I'm not havin' a very good day.
<i>- I know you're not feelin' well...

346
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,737
<i>Webber, you don't need
permission to get married.

347
00:29:01,112 --> 00:29:03,850
- Actually, you do Chief.
- Unless you're underage.

348
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:07,200
Thanks, Chief, just followin' regulations.

349
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,783
Let's go get suited up.

350
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:13,593
It's not regulation, Webber,
it's just a formality, like a courtesy.

351
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:17,172
<i>And hey!
</i> Did I hear right, that she asked you?

352
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:19,270
Followin' orders, right, Webber?

353
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,582
Yeah, she asked me, Chief.

354
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:27,975
Are you sure you're got your pants
on, Webber,<i> or is she wearin' 'em?

355
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:30,080
Sounds like this girl
cut off your pe...

356
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,600
What, Webber?
What?<i> Huh?

357
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:36,815
Don't ya got boats t'tie up?

358
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,394
She's... she's my fiancée, Sir.

359
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:42,902
Who asked you...

360
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:45,811
to be married.

361
00:29:47,563 --> 00:29:49,242
Cluver's here, let's go.

362
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:53,017
One moment.
I'm not sure.

363
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:55,312
<I>I'm sorry, Sir,
please speak up.

364
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:58,158
<I>This line is bad, Ma'am,
I'll try and re-connect.

365
00:29:58,267 --> 00:29:59,953
<I>Please, sir, the lines are down.

366
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:02,816
Bernie? How are ya? How's work?

367
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:05,656
It's been one of those days,
ya know, but how are you?

368
00:30:05,758 --> 00:30:08,867
- Hey, you're not the
radar technician, are ya?
- Ah, no.

369
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:11,537
<i>I was ordered to hole up

371

You can go wait in the
mess hall if you want to.

372
00:30:17,312 --> 00:30:18,905
Now is not a good time, ya know.

373
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:22,924
I gotta get ready and go down
to the pier, tie up some boats.

374
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:24,222
<I>I wish you were here with me.

375
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:27,771

376
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:29,689
What, are you okay?

377
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,660
Yeah, we just lost our lights.

378
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:35,338
You better go find 'em, then.

379

00:30:41,364 --> 00:30:43,675
No, not yet, Sweet.

382

392
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:19,828
Not much.

393
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:24,098
What do you think, Webber?

394
00:31:24,185 --> 00:31:26,572
You're a boatswain, too,

bar in this weather, Mr. Cluff, nobody,

396
00:31:30,377 --> 00:31:31,733
it's a suicide mission.

397
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:35,072
<i>We should take the
36-383 outta Stage Harbor.

Livesey down the fishing pier.
- Yes, Sir.

401
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:10,746
Don't get me sick, Gus,
we shouldn't even be out here.

Why you always raggin' on us, Richie?

403

Well, Bernie, it doesn't matter what Richie here thinks,

Uh-uh, Brown and them others, they're

- Get off him.

You tryin' to kill us?

426
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:58,059
The boat's in pieces, it's gone!
Enough!

427
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,985
That boat is too small for these seas.

428
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:09,658
And this ship will
be sunk by nightfall.

429
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:12,619
Now, every fella here wants to
live, the only way that happens...

430
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,374
is if we run her aground.

431
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:21,591
Set up a watch and
look out for a shoal.

432
00:36:21,758 --> 00:36:24,553
I need four men working the
pulleys on the emergency tiller.

433
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,516
<i>I need four men manning the
pumps, </i> aft of steering.

434
00:36:27,682 --> 00:36:29,377
And the rest of you on
the fuckin' line topside,

435
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:32,732
Down below! <i>Communicate

437
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:42,203
You heard him, boys,
now move it, c'mon.

438
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:49,337
It sounds like you're
the man now, Sybert.

439
00:36:51,966 --> 00:36:54,762
I hope you didn't just kill us all.

440
00:37:13,162 --> 00:37:16,208

With the wind blowing south,

444
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:30,860
I guess that's what occurs here
about now comin' up over the bar.

00:37:41,054 --> 00:37:42,548
Know what I saw.

450
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:48,141
Well, okay then...

451
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:52,799
How 'bout we go back to the Station,
see if we can get to the bottom of it?

452
00:37:53,843 --> 00:37:55,720
Just got off the phone with Boston.

453
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:57,218
They diverted a
plane from the Mercer,

454
00:37:57,331 --> 00:38:01,896
and it sighted<i> the stern of the
tanker Pendleton 5 miles east of here.

455
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:07,153
My God, two tankers broken in half in one
day, that's gotta be some kind of record.

456
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:11,033
<i>Boston and Nantucket have
dispatched all their boats to the Mercer.

457
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,327
<i>They can't make it
here in this weather.

458
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,453
Webber, <i>pick yourself a crew,</i> take
that 36-500 out and you go over the bar,

459
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:46,540
<i>and you find the stern of
the Pendleton,</i> ya hear?

460
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:51,421
Yes, sir.

461
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:05,816
Do you fellas wanna get
<i>warmed up, get some coffee?

462
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:12,250
What?

463
00:39:13,744 --> 00:39:15,371
What Carl's tryin' to say...

464
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:19,167
- This isn't about the Landry.
- Sure it is.

465
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:22,296
Eight men died that night.

466
00:39:22,464 --> 00:39:25,682
You and Gus and Masachi<i>
couldn't even get out. </i>

467
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:28,555
What makes you think
you can do it now?

468
00:39:31,684 --> 00:39:34,754
- You know the bar
on this kinda day, right, Bernie?
- Yeah.

469
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:37,581
That man in there don't know
what he's doin', he's sendin' you out to die.

470
00:39:37,744 --> 00:39:41,516
<i>You can't make it over
Chatham bar on a day like this.

471
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:44,703
You can't stay afloat for
long on half a ship neither.

472
00:39:49,494 --> 00:39:53,048
Ya know, Mr. Stello, in the Coast
Guard they say ya gotta go out...

473
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:55,467
but they also say ya
gotta come back in.

474
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:57,554
That's regulations, ya know.

475
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,809
<i>Bernie, better you</i> get lost
before you get too far out there.

476
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:03,020
Don't worry about me, Mr. Ryder,

477
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:06,066
I can't get lost out there,
I know those waters pretty good.

478
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:06,958
How can I get lost?

479
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:10,488
No, no, no, Bernie, what Dave's
tryin' to say, ya should just...

480
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:14,480
motor around the harbor,
say you tried to get out, and couldn't.

481
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,531
Ya know?

482
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,964
Thank you, Mr. Ryder, thank you..

483
00:40:23,222 --> 00:40:26,969
But, Mr. Stello, I'm gonna
do my best to... to get out there.

484
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:29,556
I don't know if I will,
but I'm gonna try.

485
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:01,444
It's okay.

486
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:05,005
I guess Richie's in?
Who else?

487
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:10,559
I don't know, Gus, you
can hardly lift your head.

488
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:14,261
Who else you gonna take, Bernie?
Fitz is the only other engineman left.

489
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:17,275
And he's only third class,
and he don't got the experience.

490
00:41:19,183 --> 00:41:24,043
I... I'll go, yeah, I... I can...
I can... I can do the job.

491
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:26,276
<i>I mean, I can do it,
what, I mean, you... you can't go.

492
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:28,576
You... you're as sick as a dog, Gus.

493
00:41:30,748 --> 00:41:32,317
He's right, Gus.

494
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:37,024
One more.

495
00:41:42,506 --> 00:41:45,061
Well, someone has to go out
there and save those guys, right?

496
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,766
That's why I signed up.
Guess now's my chance.

497
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:54,689
Seaman Ervin Maske,
Stone Horse lightship.

498
00:43:10,834 --> 00:43:12,540
Pumps aren't keepin' up.

499
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:15,017
Three more feet...

500
00:43:17,872 --> 00:43:18,845
then we lose the engines.

501
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:21,029
Did you lock that
boiler rooms full?

502
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:25,162
You're crazy to think you can steer a boat
with a few ropes and a handmade tiller, Bud.

503
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:28,441
You got a better
idea I'm all ears.

504
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:34,144
There!
A shoal about a mile distance.

505
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,285
<i>We can make that!

506
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:40,290
Rudder, 15 degrees to port,
half speed if we wanna hit it head-on.

507
00:43:40,457 --> 00:43:43,854
Gotta make her turn 80
degrees on the compass to 3-10.

508
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:52,766
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half
speed, 80 degrees to 3-10 on compass.

509
00:43:52,832 --> 00:43:56,681
15 degrees port, half speed,
80 degrees to 3-10 on compass.

510
00:43:56,731 --> 00:44:00,471
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half
speed, 80 degrees to 3-10 on the compass.

511
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:02,689
Rudder, 15 degrees port half speed...

512
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:04,685
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half speed...

513
00:44:07,194 --> 00:44:09,717
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half speed...

514
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,076
...15 degrees port, half speed...

515
00:44:25,393 --> 00:44:28,856
Rudder, 15 degrees port, at half
speed, 80 degrees to 3-10 on compass.

516
00:44:28,923 --> 00:44:31,125
Thank you, Eldon.

517
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:47,506
All right, you guys, now
pull, pull, pull, pull, come on!

518
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:17,181
Please tell me we're takin'
that boat to a bigger boat.

519
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,967
- You ever been on a rescue mission before?
- No.

520
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:24,682
Usually I just chip paint,
sometimes I cook for the boys.

521
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:26,768
Great!

522
00:45:30,758 --> 00:45:34,489
- All right, you... you take the glory hole.
- Maske, Ervin Maske.

523
00:45:34,547 --> 00:45:35,618
Ervin, yeah.

524
00:45:35,714 --> 00:45:39,101
Richie, drop the mooring
line when you can.

525
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:47,021
The last known position
of the Pendleton is here.

526
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:50,781
So I... I figure once we cross the
bar, I reckon with the currents...

527
00:45:51,023 --> 00:45:54,016
she'll have drifted about
here, that's 6 miles from us.

528
00:46:02,503 --> 00:46:05,840
So you think Bernie can
get us out past bar on this?

529
00:46:06,007 --> 00:46:08,218
I never seen
anything like it.

530
00:46:08,385 --> 00:46:12,305
Yeah, I mean he's just gotta be sure
that he doesn't pitch-bowl us, that's all.

531
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:13,890
Huh?

532
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:15,882
The power in the waves in that bar

533
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:20,031
they can pick ya up, they can turn
ya end for end over and over again.

534
00:46:20,198 --> 00:46:24,338
There's no way to survive that,
that's a pitch-bowl.

535
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:44,050
- Hey there, Fitz, we good?
- All right, give it a shot!

536
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,337
- Free the lines!
- Lines free.

537
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:39,360
- Did Bernie go out, Gus?
- Miriam, what are you doing here?

538
00:47:39,947 --> 00:47:44,359
- Did he?
- Yeah, sent him.

539
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,245
I want to talk to him.

540
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:49,290
- Who?
- Cluff.

541
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:51,227
Your commanding officer,
where is he?

542
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:55,006
I want to find out where Bernie is,
I'm worried about him.

543
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,329
We're supposed to get married.

544
00:47:56,449 --> 00:48:01,021
<i>Miriam, this isn't what the
other</i> girls do... or wives.

545
00:48:02,598 --> 00:48:04,933
<i>They don't come in here,
and they don't do this.

546
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,113
So?

547
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:19,825
<i>If you want,</i> I guess... you... you can
wait in here,<i> listen to what's going on.

548
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:24,298
Sit down.

549
00:49:09,758 --> 00:49:13,136
Tide's risin',
coulda work us off that shoal.

550
00:49:13,303 --> 00:49:16,181
- We need to hit it hard.
- Yeah, there's no other way.

551
00:49:16,974 --> 00:49:18,717
Wave!

552
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:44,072
- You feel that? She's drifting.
- Must've lost the tiller.

553
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:47,885
<i>We gotta slow her headway or
we're gonna miss the shoal for good.

554
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:53,474
Close the governor valve, cut the
propulsion, we gotta isolate the boiler.

555
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:56,019
We gotta conserve
everything she's got left.

556
00:49:56,227 --> 00:50:00,351
I keep tellin' ya...
this boat's just bad luck.

557
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:04,445
It's got nothing...
to do... with luck.

558
00:50:36,773 --> 00:50:41,484
Station Chatham,
this is the CG-36-500, do you copy?

559
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:45,656
<i>This is Station Chatham, 36-500,
what is your location. Over.

560
00:50:45,867 --> 00:50:50,189
<i>Station Chatham, we are...
we are now passing Morris Island,

561
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,096
heading down the channel
towards Chatham bar. Over.

562
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,297
- What's it mean going over that bar?
- Now, Miriam, don't do this to yourself.

563
00:50:57,464 --> 00:50:58,798
Why not?

564
00:51:00,007 --> 00:51:01,343
Why not, Gus?

565
00:51:02,761 --> 00:51:04,829
If I'm gonna be with him,
I wanna know.

566
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:11,121
- You're the girl with the bear-coat, right?
- Yeah...

567
00:51:13,197 --> 00:51:14,808
Yeah, that's me.

568
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:20,540
You gonna tell me what's
it's like out there?

569
00:51:23,285 --> 00:51:26,748
Shoals on that bar are never
in the same place twice.

570
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:30,359
<i>Flood currents carry
them big ocean swells

571
00:51:30,427 --> 00:51:33,963
<i>that rise up when they hit,
the shallows crash up against that bar.

572
00:51:34,548 --> 00:51:37,425
The outgoing tide crashes
up against that bar.

573
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:44,058
That man shouldn't'a sent them out
to cross that bar in a storm like this.

574
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:50,691
<i>Maybe they CAN turn back,</i>
maybe they get<i> lost BEFORE.

575
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,451
Can't get out.

576
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:58,013
You know Bernie, right?

577
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:01,453
You know he won't
get lost out there.

578
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:05,082
You know he follows the rules.

579
00:52:05,694 --> 00:52:08,146
Yeah, we know.

580
00:52:09,212 --> 00:52:13,926
We all going down to the pier soon,
<i>see if there's anything we can do down there.

581
00:52:17,263 --> 00:52:18,847
Welcome to come.

582
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:32,363
Miriam, Miriam,
please come here.

583
00:52:32,563 --> 00:52:33,863
Miriam?

584
00:52:36,743 --> 00:52:39,831
- Excuse me, are you Commander Cluff?
- Who are you?

585
00:52:39,897 --> 00:52:43,310
I'm Miriam Pentinen, Bernie Webber's
girlfriend, I want you to call Bernie back in.

586
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:46,378
The girl he was askin' me about,
do you know what he was gonna ask me?

587
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:48,992
For your permission to marry me.

588
00:52:49,614 --> 00:52:51,547
Well, that's between you,
him and your god.

589
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:54,471
<i>Asking me is just a formality,
he can marry</i> all he wants.

590
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:57,871
Don't you know that?
But you can't be in here, Miss.

591
00:52:58,810 --> 00:52:59,810
It's Bernie.

592
00:53:00,253 --> 00:53:03,357
<i>- Chatham bar dead ahead. Over.

Why give him permission if
you're sending him out to die?

596
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:19,000
What the hell!
Gouthro, get<i> her outta here!

597
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:24,046
Sir, wind's have gone from 40 to
60 since the call first come in.

598
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:27,839
- That's gonna hurricane strength in an hour.
<i>- Gouthro, he got his orders.

599
00:53:27,889 --> 00:53:32,014
You get her outta here, and you get
yourself to bed, you're too sick to be in here.

600
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:44,821
36-500, Station Chatham,
proceed over the bar.

601
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,157
<i>I repeat, proceed.

602
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:49,553
<i>Once over,
travel directly</i> south,

603
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:51,954
the radar's intermittent
but it's showin' a pip.

604
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:57,335
10 to 12 miles east of Monomoy
<i>Point, movin' south. Over.

605
00:53:58,628 --> 00:54:03,842
Station Chatham, this
is the 500... copy that.

606
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:18,551
I hear what everyone's sayin'.

607
00:54:19,629 --> 00:54:21,520
You don't know
what you're doing.

608
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:24,242
Excuse me?

609
00:54:24,574 --> 00:54:27,807
Maybe... maybe it's because
you're not from here.

610
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:28,802
You don't know what
it's like out there.

611
00:54:28,928 --> 00:54:32,933
What the hell would you know
what it's like out there, Miss? Hmm?

612
00:54:34,002 --> 00:54:35,753
Please just call them back.

613
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,132
What do you think it's gonna be like
being married to a Coast<i> Guard man?

614
00:54:39,299 --> 00:54:40,759
Please, call just them back.

615
00:54:40,927 --> 00:54:43,793
You gonna come in here, scared,
every time he out on the water?

616
00:54:43,854 --> 00:54:47,225
- Please call them back.
<i>- YOU, don't belong here.

617
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:53,388
- Please call them back.
- Get out of here! Get outta my station!

618
00:54:53,438 --> 00:54:56,525
<i>- And go home to where you belong, Miss.</i>
- Please call them back.

619
00:54:56,652 --> 00:54:58,479
Get out my station!

620
00:55:59,766 --> 00:56:01,560
Shoal's getting behind us.

621
00:56:03,395 --> 00:56:06,963
Only chance now is a harder turn,
if the chains hold, but...

622
00:56:07,357 --> 00:56:09,070
it could capsize us.

623
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:28,924
<i>That's good work.

624
00:56:44,024 --> 00:56:45,985
You need to stand clear, boys.

625
00:56:46,151 --> 00:56:50,323
Those shackles crash and these chains
snap and they'll rip right through ya.

626
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,326
Here we go.

627
00:57:01,837 --> 00:57:03,756
Gotta her movin' there.

628
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:15,645
You hear that?

629
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,607
That's it! That's... that's the bar.

630
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,907
Coupla minutes now, boys.

631
00:59:00,555 --> 00:59:05,310
Hey... hey boys, we won't be
able to see much, all right?

632
00:59:05,477 --> 00:59:10,525
So I have to listen to those waves
hittin' that bar... gotta time it.

633
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:14,340
<i>So I'm gonna wait for
a low</i> and then we go.

634
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:16,248
We got faith in you, Skip.

635
00:59:16,648 --> 00:59:20,244
<i>Anytime you're ready,
you just go, Bernie, all right?

636
01:00:53,725 --> 01:00:55,869
The compass is gone.

637
01:01:23,176 --> 01:01:25,054
Fitzy, the engine died.

638
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,920
- I got it, I got it.
- Nah, you don't.

639
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:42,498
You got about five seconds, boys.

640
01:01:42,564 --> 01:01:46,160
- It's gravity pad, it doesn't... no way trace out...
- I know!

641
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:53,376
Come on, turn it on!

642
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:17,528
Maske? Get back here.

643
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:27,124
Tide's rising!
It'll get us through.

644
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:31,086
But let me know what's coming.

645
01:04:24,758 --> 01:04:28,928
Hey Fitz! We made it over
the bar,<i> back to spotlight!

646
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:33,976
Comin' out.

647
01:04:48,758 --> 01:04:50,794
We turned too late!

648
01:04:52,678 --> 01:04:54,680
We gotta buy that time back!

649
01:04:54,847 --> 01:04:59,790
Tell Sybert we need 30 degrees in the
next two minutes or we'll miss that shoal.

650
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:04,093
30 degrees in the next two minutes.

651
01:05:04,189 --> 01:05:05,631
30 degrees in the next two minutes.

652
01:05:07,316 --> 01:05:08,894
30 degrees in the next two minutes.

653
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:12,745
30 degrees in the next two minutes.

654
01:05:18,243 --> 01:05:21,579
- We're puttin' her in reverse.
- You gonna let the ocean push us.

655
01:05:22,872 --> 01:05:24,081
Hold on.

656
01:06:28,546 --> 01:06:30,847
You may wanna brace yourself, Eldon.

657
01:06:33,058 --> 01:06:34,476
3-18.

658
01:06:39,939 --> 01:06:41,899
3-16.

659
01:06:42,525 --> 01:06:46,844
Close it down as soon as she hits!

660
01:06:47,321 --> 01:06:48,905
3-12.

661
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,792
Gentlemen!
Brace yourselves.

662
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:05,670
Hold on!

663
01:07:12,134 --> 01:07:13,677
Now!

664
01:08:17,025 --> 01:08:18,158
Well...

665
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:26,866
You did it! It bloody
well worked, Mr. Sybert!

666
01:08:30,244 --> 01:08:33,664
You gotta keep the water away
from the air inlets to the engine.

667
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:37,208
We lose power,
we lose our pumps.

668
01:08:39,169 --> 01:08:42,922
I'm afraid they're takin' on so much water
and the wave'll pull us right back off the shoal.

669
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:49,861
Feels funny to not be
movin around, huh, Eldon?

670
01:08:53,515 --> 01:08:56,725
All right, let's get to it.

671
01:09:21,456 --> 01:09:23,082
We're headin' down the lodge,
everything okay?

672
01:09:23,966 --> 01:09:26,210
Quiet down now, my God,
give me a break.

673
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:29,301
I was on my way home,
my car spun out into a ditch.

674
01:09:29,362 --> 01:09:30,555
I need some help.

675
01:09:31,423 --> 01:09:33,024
Yeah, all right,
we live near here.

676
01:09:33,091 --> 01:09:36,974
We can go back to my house, I'll call
my brother, he can pull you out, jump in.

677
01:09:40,556 --> 01:09:42,641
- Thank you.
- You don't got a coat?

678
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:46,978
You can move that, we're bringin' it down
to St. Martin's in case ther're any survivors.

679
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:53,442
- I... I left my coat at the Coast Guard station.
- Ya gotta man there?

680
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:54,818
Stop it.

681
01:09:58,071 --> 01:10:00,367
He is not there now right now, it's a...

682
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:05,953
- Bernie Webber?
- Yeah, Bernie he's a good man.

683
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,595
We can't find them
without a compass, Bernie.

684
01:10:27,054 --> 01:10:29,281
We got no idea where they are.

685
01:10:32,351 --> 01:10:33,661
Hold on.

686
01:11:05,172 --> 01:11:06,923
You okay?

687
01:11:07,882 --> 01:11:11,886
- You okay?
- I'm havin' a great time now, Bernie!

688
01:11:12,053 --> 01:11:13,379
A whole lotta fun.

689
01:11:18,349 --> 01:11:19,909
Brace yourselves!

690
01:11:33,196 --> 01:11:35,907
Whole lotta... a whole lotta fun here.

691
01:11:45,052 --> 01:11:48,089
- C'mon, take it, use it.
- Consider it done.

692
01:11:53,721 --> 01:11:55,982
<i>- What's wrong with it!?</i>
- We lost the pumps.

693
01:11:56,049 --> 01:11:59,469
- The pumps are tripin' the breakers.
- I'll go check the connections.

694
01:12:01,972 --> 01:12:03,409
Give me the light.

695
01:12:04,557 --> 01:12:09,061
It's not worth a damn.
Sometimes I wish I didn't understand you.

696
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:12,064
Sybert, what's goin' on?

697
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:16,067
We're usin' every pump we got.

698
01:12:17,026 --> 01:12:19,762
We jammed the breakers so
the pumps wouldn't trickle.

699
01:12:19,828 --> 01:12:21,545
We got about two feet till the water

700
01:12:21,595 --> 01:12:24,470
hits those air inlets to the
engine and then the ship's dead.

701
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,844
- Jesus Christ.
- Do you hear that?

702
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:29,077
That's the tide's rising
gonna work us off this shoal.

703
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:32,131
- Butt luck.
- This'll at least give us some time.

704
01:12:32,832 --> 01:12:35,917
- Isn't that right, Mr. Sybert?
- That right, sure it is, Bud.

705
01:12:37,077 --> 01:12:39,796
Yeah, as long as we got a
generator that's keepin' the pumps goin'.

706
01:12:41,506 --> 01:12:43,649
By whoever might be comin'
to find us, we'll buy a little time.

707
01:12:43,716 --> 01:12:46,681
You wanted be to be the man,
Sybert, now you the man, right?

708
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:49,387
Except you got no wife,
you got no kids back home.

709
01:12:50,848 --> 01:12:55,818
You're a single man... <i>always hidin'
down below,</i> what do you gotta lose?

710
01:12:55,868 --> 01:12:57,386
All right,
that's enough, Brown.

711
01:13:00,148 --> 01:13:02,107
I'm scared to, Brown.

712
01:13:03,401 --> 01:13:05,193
I gotta a life the same as you.

713
01:13:10,031 --> 01:13:12,825
Just don't see the point in
sittin' around talkin' about it.

714
01:13:17,371 --> 01:13:22,880
Station Chatham, 36-500,
Station Chatham, 36-500, do you copy?

715
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:27,424
<i>Station Chatham,
this is Chief Bangs, CG-36-383,

716

CG-36-500, do you copy?

717
01:13:32,717 --> 01:13:35,729
Why can't they hear us,
Bernie, we hear them?

718
01:13:35,795 --> 01:13:40,099
<i>- The seas are too high, zero headway.</i>
- Station Chatham, do you copy?

719
01:13:40,191 --> 01:13:41,985
Repeat, we're comin' home.

720
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:45,902
Station Chatham this is 36-383,
return to Old Harbor.

721
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:49,316
Pollock lightship,
CG-36-500, do you copy?

722
01:13:49,482 --> 01:13:51,150
We are all alone.

723
01:13:51,943 --> 01:13:55,568
You heard, Bangs on the Radio, it
sounds like he couldn't get out, goin' back in,

724
01:13:56,102 --> 01:13:57,723
storm is getting worse.

725
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,009
We should turn back in, Webber.

726
01:14:01,577 --> 01:14:06,001
<i>Bernie, we already made it out</i>
further than anybody thought was possible!

727
01:14:06,456 --> 01:14:10,918
Maybe Richie's right,
maybe we should just go back!

728
01:14:10,985 --> 01:14:17,423
<i>Weather report says 8 to 9, repeat,
wind reported 8 to 9, heavy...

729
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:19,333
You heard Bangs on the radio.

730
01:14:19,467 --> 01:14:22,428
We have no compass,
we have no way to communicate.

731
01:14:25,981 --> 01:14:29,976
- You are...
- What? What? I'm what, Ritchie?

732
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:37,191
I brought us this far, didn't I?
Not Bangs, not Cluff, not nobody else... I did it!

733
01:14:43,738 --> 01:14:45,240
We did it, Richie.

734
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:50,745
You wanna turn back around?

735
01:14:52,997 --> 01:14:56,299
No, no, not now,
we came too far.

736
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,668
We are not gonna leave 'em.

737
01:15:01,295 --> 01:15:03,130
Not on my watch.

738
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:07,009
Just do your job.

739
01:15:11,429 --> 01:15:14,515
Turn off the beam,
Fitz, we're gonna in dark.

740
01:15:14,682 --> 01:15:18,018
Better shot at seein' light from
the Pendleton if we're runnin' dark.

741
01:15:25,858 --> 01:15:27,235
Watch it.

742
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:34,441
Get back here.

743
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:38,086
Get your butts back here!

744
01:15:38,912 --> 01:15:40,955
I lost my hat.

745
01:16:06,644 --> 01:16:07,953
You okay?

746
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:15,694
Yeah, yeah,
I'm just tired, come on.

747
01:16:20,406 --> 01:16:22,366
You kids go on and
play in the bedroom.

748
01:16:22,633 --> 01:16:24,777
You can wait with them, Megs
while I call my brother.

749
01:16:24,797 --> 01:16:27,688
Thanks, please call me Miriam.

750
01:16:45,003 --> 01:16:47,380
You think your mother would
mind if I turn on the radio?

751
01:16:54,478 --> 01:16:57,314
<i>Coast Guard Boston,
this is the Unimak.

752
01:16:57,481 --> 01:17:00,558
<i>We're at the Mercer bow now,
here in support of the Yakutat.

753
01:17:00,624 --> 01:17:04,378
<i>Four Mercer crew men jumped
from the deck, all were lost.

754
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:08,866
<i>Repeat, four men lost.
Several crew members have hypothermia.

755
01:17:09,032 --> 01:17:13,119
<i>We're gonna for daybreak to
attempt another rescue. Over.

756
01:17:14,996 --> 01:17:19,658
Does no good listenin' to all that chatter,
Miriam... better learnin' live not knowin'.

757
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:26,552
...at roughly 1900 hours we...

758
01:17:31,552 --> 01:17:34,954
- How long you been married to Bernie for?
- We're...

759
01:17:39,308 --> 01:17:41,269
We're not married yet.

760
01:17:43,729 --> 01:17:47,015
- I didn't know if I...
- Like I said, Bernie, he's a good man.

761
01:17:51,236 --> 01:17:53,493
Him and some of them others
try gettin' out a year ago,

762
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:55,675
save my husband Arnie and
the crew of the Landry.

763
01:17:55,948 --> 01:17:58,186
They're out fishin'
marlin near Nantucket Sound

764
01:17:58,236 --> 01:18:01,203
when the boat started takin'
on water, night just like this.

765
01:18:02,413 --> 01:18:05,165
Come on, we gotta get goin'.

766
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:08,823
Brother's on his way to come meet us.
I gotta get down to the lodge, come on, you two.

767
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:56,137
Do you know who she is?

768
01:19:57,214 --> 01:20:01,335
Ain't Bernie's fault, Carly,
nobody's fault, it's like her blaming you.

769
01:20:02,387 --> 01:20:03,680
For what?

770
01:20:03,847 --> 01:20:07,159
You're the one that told me there was no other ship
there, they're out there because of you, right?

771
01:21:24,317 --> 01:21:27,153
Fitz, turn on the searchlight.

772
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,398
I can't believe we found her,
look at that!

773
01:22:22,678 --> 01:22:26,558
We're too late,
she's a ghost ship.

774
01:22:30,346 --> 01:22:33,101
- Are you seeing this, Sir?
- Yeah.

775
01:22:33,201 --> 01:22:34,978
Yeah, yeah, I see him.

776
01:22:35,577 --> 01:22:37,529
Not sure I believe it.

777
01:22:40,782 --> 01:22:42,952
Where is the hell's he goin'?

778
01:22:51,337 --> 01:22:52,922
Good to see you, boys.

779
01:22:59,728 --> 01:23:01,228
Careful.

780
01:23:07,982 --> 01:23:13,154
- How we gonna fit them all on this boat?
- We're only built to hold 12, including us.

781
01:23:14,465 --> 01:23:16,367
That's just regulation though, right?

782
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:22,415
How many could he fit?

783
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:25,502
Twenty, twenty-two tops.

784
01:23:28,131 --> 01:23:29,098
Wait.

785
01:23:29,165 --> 01:23:31,134
They comin' down here.

786
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,173
Drag to station, port side.

787
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:29,578
Come on, I gotcha.

788
01:24:50,311 --> 01:24:51,512
We got ya.

789
01:25:01,282 --> 01:25:02,658
Maske, get over here!

790
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,748
Come on!
Grab him!

791
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:26,771
You know where you goin' now, Miss?

792
01:25:27,855 --> 01:25:29,190
I think so.

793
01:25:29,908 --> 01:25:31,735
Thanks for your help, Mr. Nickerson.

794
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:32,935
<i>Yeah.

795
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:35,164
You know...

796
01:25:36,123 --> 01:25:39,119
- Bernie ain't out there, 'cause of me.
- Yeah, I know.

797
01:25:40,588 --> 01:25:43,040
It's Bernie's job to go out, right?

798
01:25:46,544 --> 01:25:48,380
How can I blame me for it?

799
01:26:03,498 --> 01:26:06,249
Nice and slow! Nice and slow!
You're all right!

800
01:26:06,299 --> 01:26:07,953
- Stop pushing!
- Pete, you're next.

801
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:11,199
- Take it nice and slow! Easy! Easy!
- Come on.

802
01:26:19,409 --> 01:26:21,752
<i>We gotta go!
We're leavin' nobody behind.

803
01:26:21,919 --> 01:26:24,614
- Get on that ladder.
- We gotta get him down.

804
01:26:24,656 --> 01:26:25,758
<i>We don't have enough time.

805
01:26:25,888 --> 01:26:28,881
<i>She's slippin',
we gotta get off this ship.

806
01:26:29,578 --> 01:26:30,880
<i>Hurry!

807
01:26:31,055 --> 01:26:32,811
Eldon, how you doin'?

808
01:26:34,142 --> 01:26:35,936
I'm scared.

809
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:40,874
Well...

810
01:26:42,317 --> 01:26:46,406
- it'd be a lot scarier up here without us.
<i>- You gotta listen to me!

811
01:26:47,407 --> 01:26:49,763
- Eldon?
<i>- We're all gonna get off, stop pushin'!

812
01:26:49,802 --> 01:26:54,866
You just follow right behind me...
if I can do it, anyone can.

813
01:27:08,183 --> 01:27:09,928
Come on.

814
01:27:24,677 --> 01:27:26,677
<i>Hold tight!

815
01:27:35,965 --> 01:27:38,593
<i>Tiny! Tiny! Hold on!

816
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:37,905
Eldon.

817
01:28:41,042 --> 01:28:43,837
<i>Eldon, look at me!
Look at me!

818
01:28:56,227 --> 01:28:58,938
When I say, "jump", let go!
Ready?

819
01:29:06,514 --> 01:29:07,648
Jump!

820
01:29:11,696 --> 01:29:13,264
You okay?

821
01:29:15,366 --> 01:29:16,666
Hold tight.

822
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:24,527
They're ridin' so heavy,
you can hardly see her.

823
01:29:24,594 --> 01:29:27,547
They're saying there's
7 or 8 up there onboard.

824
01:29:29,349 --> 01:29:34,731
Maybe...we take these guys
back in... come back out.

825
01:29:43,074 --> 01:29:46,995
Can't leave 'em out here
alone, that boat won't last.

826
01:29:49,415 --> 01:29:51,459
We all live or we all die.

827
01:29:53,871 --> 01:29:55,372
Right?

828
01:30:29,089 --> 01:30:32,750
You... you did good.

829
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,721
You should be the last one off,
Mr. Sybert.

830
01:31:35,248 --> 01:31:36,534
<i>Last man!

831
01:33:16,118 --> 01:33:20,332
Hey Fitz! <i> Turn off
that searchlight, yeah?

832
01:33:44,802 --> 01:33:47,655

rest.</i> The captain of the Pollock Rip sent word...

834

<i>- Mr. Cluff, it is 36-500, it's Bernie

- Not in this weather.

845

Can they make it back?

How did you find us
without a compass?

875
01:37:15,283 --> 01:37:20,992
We... we just jogged along
with the seasonal currents.

876
01:37:25,575 --> 01:37:27,575
I think we just got lucky.

877
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:30,255
- Yeah.
- Yeah...

878

To be honest with ya, I'm not sure.

881
01:37:43,158 --> 01:37:46,768
Just... disobeyed all my ranking officers.

882
01:37:47,639 --> 01:37:50,771
They don't know,
so I guess I... I'd better, right?

883
01:37:51,075 --> 01:37:53,367
With the wind on my left goin' out,

884
01:37:53,925 --> 01:37:59,575
even if I... keep it her on my right,
we oughta be headin' the right direction.

We follow the lights onshore,
follow all the lights onshore.

01:38:37,292 --> 01:38:39,075
I'm puttin' the sea behind us.

889
01:38:41,033 --> 01:38:44,254
Just let it push us along,
till we land up somewhere.

890
01:38:44,604 --> 01:38:46,819
The storm's... the storm's
easing' up, boys, so...

891
01:38:46,869 --> 01:38:49,795
we just look for the lights
on the shore to guide us in.

892
01:38:49,845 --> 01:38:55,807
Even if we have to go so far as Nobska Point.
So be it! We just gonna find land!

893
01:39:00,075 --> 01:39:03,158
It's been one heck of a
long day, right fellas?

894
01:39:04,183 --> 01:39:07,318
Yeah, it sure has!

895

But don't you give
up hope on me now.

896
01:39:13,742 --> 01:39:16,200
It's a good boat,
she'll get us through.

897
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:21,904
We'll get you home, okay?
We're all goin' home.

898
01:39:23,242 --> 01:39:24,908
We're with you, Skipper.

899
01:42:49,975 --> 01:42:54,254
- Keep the lights on, like SHE'S doin'!
- Quick! Turn your lights on!

900
01:42:54,304 --> 01:42:56,700
Turn on the lights, everyone.

901
01:42:57,867 --> 01:42:59,946
<i>More light,
so that they can see us.

902
01:43:49,683 --> 01:43:51,955
I think we made it over the bar.

903
01:43:55,117 --> 01:43:58,360
That high tide carried us over!

904
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:00,913
You see that?

905
01:44:22,917 --> 01:44:25,342
<i>Fitz, turn on the searchlight.

906
01:44:56,875 --> 01:45:01,088
<i>- Look, you see that?
- Is that our boys!

907
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:13,333
It's them?

908
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:18,023
<i>Well done, Bernie!

909
01:45:18,683 --> 01:45:22,138
<i>- You did it, Webber!
- Well done, Webber!

910
01:45:22,742 --> 01:45:26,233
<i>36-500 is now docking
at the Chatham pier.

911
01:45:26,283 --> 01:45:30,938
There appear to be 32 survivors, Sir.
Repeat, we have 32 survivors.

912
01:45:51,975 --> 01:45:53,768
<i>Atta boy! Bernie.

913
01:46:04,375 --> 01:46:05,667
Give me a hand.

914
01:46:06,617 --> 01:46:08,217
C'mon, good to see ya.

915
01:46:08,283 --> 01:46:10,708
<i>Take it easy!

916
01:46:11,875 --> 01:46:15,790
<i>- This man's freezing, get me a coat.
Go on in, it's warm inside.

917
01:46:17,683 --> 01:46:18,783
Let's get you up to the lodge.

918
01:46:36,725 --> 01:46:38,285
Good job, Cap'n.

919
01:46:41,392 --> 01:46:43,371
<i>Well done, Bernie.

920
01:46:56,005 --> 01:46:57,705
Webber?

921
01:47:24,517 --> 01:47:25,842
Bernie.

922
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:07,328
Let's go.

923
01:48:40,567 --> 01:48:42,375
We still got till April 16th.

924
01:48:43,675 --> 01:48:45,343
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

925
01:48:46,508 --> 01:48:48,051
I asked Cluff for ya.

926
01:48:49,683 --> 01:48:52,534
- He said it's just a formality.
- Formality.

927
01:48:53,654 --> 01:48:55,647
Now I know, right?
