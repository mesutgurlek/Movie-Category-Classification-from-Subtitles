1
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,870
My mommy
always said there were no monsters.

2
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,870
No real ones.

3
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,830
But there are.

4
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,470
We've seen no additional defects.

5
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,790
- She's perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

6
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,310
- Careful.
- Two centimeters.

7
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,190
Okay.

8
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,350
Okay.

9
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,510
Yeah.
Ready with that amnio.

10
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,070
- Oh.
- And...

11
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,390
there it is.

12
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,710
Oh!

13
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,830
No.

14
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,230
Be careful.

15
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,550
Jesus.

16
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,630
Clamp it.

17
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,110
What about her?
Can we keep her alive?

18
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,030
How's the host?

19
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,590
Doing well.

20
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,750
Sew her back up.

21
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,150
Excellent work, everybody.

22
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,750
And how is
our Number Eight today?

23
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,230
Appears to be
in good health.

24
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,190
- Hmm? How good?
- Excellent...

25
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,910
as in completely off
our projected charts.

26
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,150
Look at the scar tissue.

27
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,310
- See the recession?
- This is from three days ago?

28
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,910
- Exactly.
- Oh, this is good.

29
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,150
This is very good.

30
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,070
You're gonna make us all
very proud.

31
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,830
Don't! I'm all right.

32
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,950
Now try this.

33
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,790
- Hand.
- Close.

34
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,790
Glove.

35
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,230
Number Eight?

36
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,150
Fruit.

37
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,190
- Good. Cherries.
- It's unprecedented.

38
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,430
Totally.
She's operating...

39
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,110
at a completely
adult capacity.

40
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,590
- What about her memories?
- There are gaps.

41
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,790
And some degree
of synaptic dissonance.

42
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,710
She's freaked.

43
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,310
"It" has connective
difficulties...

44
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,550
caused by a biochemical imbalance,
causing emotional autism.

45
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,030
- Certain reactions...
- All right, wait a second!

46
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,110
"It"has memories.
Why does "it"have memories?

47
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,350
Well, I'm guessing, but...

48
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,230
inherited memories passed down
generationally at a genetic level...

49
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,830
by the aliens,
like "its" strength.

50
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,950
Plus a, uh,
highly evolved form of instinct.

51
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,310
An unexpected benefit
from the genetic crossing.

52
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,790
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
I see.

53
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,190
Stupid me.
Of course.

54
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,310
An unexpected benefit
of the genetic process.

55
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,470
Oh! And I didn't
even think of that!

56
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,230
Let's try this one.

57
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,790
Ripley?

58
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,230
Ripley, what is it?

59
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,110
Ripley?
Ripley?

60
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,670
You're not thinking
termination?

61
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,590
Oh, boy,
am I thinking termination.

62
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,510
General, we do not perceive this
to be a problem.

63
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,150
Ellen Ripley died trying
to wipe this species out.

64
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,470
For all intents and purposes,
she succeeded.

65
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,950
I'm not anxious to see her
taking up her old hobbies.

66
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,350
- That won't happen.
- We won't tell her.

67
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,470
Oh, I see.
And that's supposed to comfort me?

68
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,470
Identification, please.

69
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,230
Please try again.

70
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,550
Thank you, General Perez.

71
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,750
Bottom line is,
she looks at me funny one time...

72
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,590
I'm putting her down.

73
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,950
Okay, as far as I'm concerned,
Number Eight...

74
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,590
is a meat... by-product.

75
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,430
Her Majesty here
is the real payoff.

76
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,670
When does she start producing?

77
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,470
Days. Less, maybe.

78
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,870
- We need the cargo.
- I told you, it's on its way.

79
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,270
Fork.

80
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,790
- Fuck.
- It's-It's "fork."

81
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,790
How did you...

82
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,390
How did... we get you?

83
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,870
Yes.

84
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,590
Hard work.
We used blood samples...

85
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,670
from Fiori Sixteen on ice...

86
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,910
where you died.

87
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,910
We've remade you.
We cloned you.

88
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,910
Fiori Sixteen.

89
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,870
Does that ring a bell?

90
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,030
Are you
remembering something?

91
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,350
- Does it grow?
- Yeah.

92
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,150
Very rapidly.

93
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,950
It's a queen.

94
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,030
How did you know that?

95
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,310
She'll breed.
You'll die.

96
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,910
Everyone in the company will die.

97
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,830
In the... In the...
In the company?

98
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,990
Weyland Yutani.
Ripley Eight's former employers.

99
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,110
Terran growth conglomerate.
They had...

100
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,350
defense contracts under
the military.

101
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,790
They went under decades ago,
Gediman. Way before your time.

102
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,710
Bought out by Wal-Mart.

103
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,790
Fortunes of war.

104
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,950
I think you will find
that, uh...

105
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,430
things have changed a great deal
since your time.

106
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,750
I doubt that.

107
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,670
We're not flying
blind here, you know.

108
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,590
It's United Systems Military,
not some greedy corporation.

109
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,950
Oh. Well, it won't
make any difference.

110
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,350
You're still gonna die.

111
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,270
How do you feel about that?

112
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,550
I wish you could understand
what we're trying to do here.

113
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,230
The potential for this species
goes way beyond urban pacification.

114
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,470
New alloys, new vaccines.

115
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,190
Nothing like this we've ever
seen on any world before.

116
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,590
You should be very proud.

117
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,190
Oh. I am.

118
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,910
And the animal itself...

119
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,070
wondrous.

120
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,070
The potential, unbelievable,
once we've tamed him.

121
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,550
Roll over. Play dead.

122
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,310
- Heel.
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,870
You can't teach it tricks.

124
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,790
Why not?
We're teaching you.

125
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,670
Hey, son, I'll give you
my authorization code.

126
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,030
It's E-A-T-M-E.

127
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,430
I'm sorry, sir. Could you repeat that?

128
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,390
Little prick.
You know...

129
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,670
no matter how many times
you see it...

130
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,510
the sight of a woman all strapped up
in a chair like that just...

131
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,910
- What? - Just bring us in
on a 3-0 descent, would you?

132
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,870
- And ride the parallel.
- Darlin', it is done.

133
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,110
Good girl.

134
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,310
You, uh, want
anything there, Trigger?

135
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,350
Mmm. Yeah.
How 'bout a cup of coffee?

136
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,470
Anything else,
while your mouth's warm, I mean?

137
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,550
Little milk.

138
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,110
Hey, don't cut thrust
till about 600 meters...

139
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,590
and we'll give 'em
a little scare.

140
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,270
Vriess. Call.

141
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,270
Lock down.
We're gonna dock.

142
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,950
- Hey, Call?
- Yep?

143
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,510
What has two thumbs,
one eye...

144
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,030
a pink tongue...

145
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,470
and screws like a god?

146
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,630
What?

147
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,070
Two thumbs, one eye,
a pink tongue...

148
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,670
and screws like a god?

149
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,550
What?

150
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,150
Hey.

151
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,830
Time to enjoy some of
the general's hospitality, Christie.

152
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,990
Great.
Army food.

153
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,830
Yeah. It'll do till we get
the family wagon up to spec, I reckon.

154
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,390
- Yeah.
- That is if the natives are friendly.

155
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,830
- How's that?
- Good.

156
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,390
We expecting any,
uh, trouble?

157
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,310
Nah. From Perez, I doubt it. But you
never know. We've been there before.

158
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,510
What is wrong with you?

159
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,710
Just a little target practice.

160
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,830
Vriess isn't complaining.

161
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,270
Goddamn it!
Johner, you son of a bitch!

162
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,870
Come on, man.
You didn't feel a thing.

163
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,350
You are an inbred motherfucker,
you know that?

164
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,070
I'll take the knife back now.

165
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,790
Whoa.

166
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,150
Call, forget it.

167
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,350
He's been sucking down
too much home brew.

168
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,670
The knife.

169
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,070
Son of a bitch!

170
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,430
Don't push me, little Call.
If you hang with us for a while...

171
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,990
you'll find out I am not the man
with whom to fuck!

172
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,270
It's about time we start associating
with a better class of people.

173
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,630
I am Father.

174
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,510
Welcome to the U.S.M. Auriga.

175
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,110
Step forward for
contraband and weapons search.

176
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,070
Please report
any infectious diseases...

177
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,990
to the medical officers.

178
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,990
- Levels seven through twelve
are off-limits to civilians.

179
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,470
Thank you for your cooperation.

180
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,390
Go.

181
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,510
- Put your hands up, please, sir.
- What?

182
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,830
Could you get
your hands up, please?

183
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,990
There are no weapons
allowed on board, sir.

184
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,510
My own recipe.

185
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,590
Way more dangerous.

186
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,430
Nice welcome, Perez.
What the hell is this?

187
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,950
What, are you afraid the six of us are
gonna hijack your damn ship or what?

188
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,470
Just a minor concern that one
of your asshole crew members...

189
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,950
is gonna get drunk and put
a bullet through the hull.

190
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,110
We happen to be
in space, Elgyn.

191
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,590
No shit.
How you been?

192
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,950
Wanna check the chair?

193
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,470
- Elgyn, these were very,
very hard to come by.

194
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,470
So was our cargo.

195
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,950
You're, uh, not about to plead
poverty on me, are you, General?

196
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,990
Just saying very few people
deal in cash nowadays.

197
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,630
Just the ones don't like
to keep business records.

198
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,190
- Yourself, for example.
- Drink, Elgyn?

199
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,110
Constantly.

200
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,070
Now, I'm gonna take
a wild guess here, General...

201
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,670
but I'm thinking whatever
you got going on here...

202
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,350
it ain't exactly approved
by Congress.

203
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,550
Who's the... new filly
you got on board, Elgyn?

204
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,830
Call. Little girl
playing pirates.

205
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,990
She makes an impression.

206
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,750
She is severely fuckable,
ain't she?

207
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,990
Mighty handy with a monkey wrench too,
I might add.

208
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,550
I think Vriess's got a bit
of a light in his eye for her.

209
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,630
Fine little ass like that'd make
a man walk. You know what I mean?

210
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,390
Mind you, uh, I think
she's just a tad curious...

211
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,110
about, uh,
this transaction of ours.

212
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,030
I mean, I can't say
as I blame her.

213
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,430
It's awfully
cloak-and-dagger stuff.

214
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,910
It's a military operation.

215
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,950
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,830
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but, uh...

217
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,990
I was under the impression
that, uh...

218
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,390
most army medical labs don't have
to operate outside of regulated space.

219
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,510
- What do you want, Elgyn? What can I do for you?
- Me?

220
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,870
- Yeah.
- Oh, two days bed and board.

221
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,910
You know, Vriess might wanna
snag a part here or there, whatever.

222
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,830
I mean, uh,
if it's not imposing.

223
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,630
I don't see any problem.

224
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,550
- Couple of conditions, though.
- Ah.

225
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,070
Conditions?

226
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,470
Not you...

227
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,390
nor any of your...

228
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,550
formidable crew members...

229
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,710
will go anywhere near
restricted areas.

230
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,790
Rule number two:

231
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,390
No trouble.

232
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,710
- Good behavior.
- Good behavior.

233
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,430
- No fights.
- No fights.

234
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,030
- No fights.
- No fights.

235
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,710
Mi casa es su casa.

236
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,310
Please direct cargo
to med lab center, area "G."

237
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,990
Follow the lit path.

238
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,910
Do not deviate.

239
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,190
Cargo status... stable.

240
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,830
Life-forms intact.

241
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,310
Stasis uninterrupted.

242
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,710
Med lab center
is off-limits to civilians.

243
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,630
Thank you.

244
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,790
- Oh.
- Hey. Chill.

245
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,070
- Oh, please.
- You know I can't lay off the tall ones.

246
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,190
How you doin'?
How about a little one-on-one?

247
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,190
What do you say?

248
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,550
You got some moves
on you, girl.

249
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,470
Oh, man.

250
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,790
Mm-hmm.

251
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,590
Well, if you don't wanna play basketball,
I know some other indoor sports.

252
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,790
Come on, now.
Give me the ball.

253
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,190
Oh, God!

254
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,230
Okay, I got a new game.
Tag!

255
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,830
Ripley? Ripley.

256
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,750
You've had enough fun.

257
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,590
What the hell are you?

258
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,590
Something of a predator,
isn't she?

259
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,430
Yes, she continues
to make us all very proud.

260
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:45,270
We're coming up on just
one minute and 30 seconds left...

261
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,190
to order this one-of-a-kind
collector's item.

262
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:51,990
Jesus Christ, Johner, what do you
put in this shit, battery acid?

263
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,990
Just for color.

264
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,430
So, we're a fast learner.

265
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,550
This is a really good show, man.

266
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,310
It's from the
Gut Cutter's Celebration Collection...

267
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,310
makers of premier
knives and edgeware.

268
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,030
The knife features
a stainless steel blade...

269
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,310
perfect for any use
in hunting or in the home.

270
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,150
The pro handle is made
from authentic antique plywood...

271
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,790
and stained in brilliant colors
for an uncanny charm.

272
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,230
Hey, man, that shit
is not easy to come by!

273
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,870
Why don't you take
a walk outside?

274
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,790
Great!

275
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,350
- I'm so sorry.
- Now I smell like this shit!

276
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,270
Lfbitches can't handle this shit...

277
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,510
bitches should stay away
from this shit!

278
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,550
Identification, please.

279
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,430
Please try again.

280
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,910
Please try again.

281
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,790
Thank you, General Perez.

282
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,150
Well?

283
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,710
You gonna kill me,
or what?

284
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,190
There's no point,
is there?

285
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,670
They've taken
it out of you.

286
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,550
Where is it?
Is it on the ship?

287
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,390
You mean my baby?

288
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,470
I don't get it.
If they took it out...

289
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,110
why are they
keeping you alive?

290
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,110
Well, they're curious.
I'm the latest thing.

291
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,430
Look...

292
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,350
I can make it all stop.

293
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,230
The pain, this nightmare.
That's all I can offer you.

294
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,950
What makes you think...

295
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,110
I would let you do that?

296
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,870
Who are you?

297
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,790
Ripley, Ellen,
Lieutenant First Class...

298
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,110
number 3-6-7-0-6.

299
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,230
Ellen Ripley died
200 years ago.

300
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,630
You're not her.

301
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,030
I'm not her.

302
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,270
Who am I?

303
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,990
You're a thing,
a construct.

304
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,230
They grew you
in a fucking lab.

305
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,470
And now they brought it
out of you.

306
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,390
Not all the way out.

307
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,110
I can feel it...
behind my eyes.

308
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,630
I can hear it moving.

309
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,110
You gotta help me stop this thing
before it gets loose.

310
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,190
It's too late.

311
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,630
You can't stop it.
It's inevitable.

312
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,550
Not as long
as I'm around.

313
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,910
You'll never
get out of here alive.

314
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,430
I don't care.

315
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,390
Really?

316
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,550
I can make it stop.

317
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,390
Go on.
Get out of here.

318
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,390
They're looking for you.

319
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:54,390
I think you're gonna find that
this was very ill-advised.

320
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,870
- Where are her friends?
- They're in the mess hall, sir.

321
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,990
Well, you find them, now.
Quietly.

322
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,710
What the hell
is going on here?

323
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,630
Smells like a double-cross, boss.

324
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,950
Where's the other one?
With the chair?

325
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,070
Don't ever touch me!
Ever!

326
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,550
You wanna tell us
what this is?

327
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,550
- You wanna tell me who you're workin' for?
- What?

328
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,630
- Wren, they got nothing to do with this.
- To do with what?

329
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,550
Do you know what the penalties
for terrorist activity are?

330
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,230
No goddamn terrorists on my crew.
Call, there something you wanna tell me?

331
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,110
I don't care whether you knew or not. You
brought a terrorist on board a military vessel.

332
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,350
And as far as I am concerned,
you all die with her!

333
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,110
Do you understand?

334
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,190
Yeah. I understand.

335
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,190
Christie.

336
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,550
Freeze!

337
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,710
Stop!
Drop your weapons!

338
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,470
And you! Drop that piece of shit,
or I blow his head off!

339
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,870
- Can't do that, man.
- Drop it, now!

340
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,390
- Can't do that. They're attached to me.
- I'm not fucking with you!

341
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,550
You're all under arrest for a code eight,
which is concealed weapons...

342
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,950
and a code twelve,
which is murder!

343
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,550
- Release Dr. Wren!
- Kiss my ass.

344
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,630
Put down your weapons
and assume the fucking...

345
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,590
Everybody okay?

346
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,870
Real easy, soldier boy.

347
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,230
- Security!
- Get up!

348
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,750
There is a serious problem
in the mess hall.

349
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,870
You lie to me now,
little girl...

350
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,110
I will cut your throat and leave you
here to die, you understand me?

351
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,630
- This is Security, section two. We do not read you.
- Hello? Goddamn it!

352
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,630
- We do not copy you. Please repeat.
- Hello?

353
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,790
Gediman!

354
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,390
He's conducting illegal experiments.
He is breeding some sort of...

355
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,470
- Ice the goddamn mole!
- Listen to me! He is breeding an alien species.

356
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,390
More than dangerous.
If those things get loose...

357
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,030
it's gonna make the Lacerta Plague
look like a fucking square dance!

358
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,950
Shut up!

359
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,310
Listen.

360
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,750
Your attention, please.

361
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,430
Security breach, med lab,
level fifteen.

362
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,110
Go. Let's get back to the Betty. Doctor
and soldier boy here can see us to the door.

363
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,270
- What about Vriess?
- Fuck Vriess.

364
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,990
Your attention, please.

365
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:07,270
Unauthorized opening
of cage three.

366
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,870
Unauthorized opening
of cages five...

367
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,070
seven, eight, ten...

368
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,310
- Move it!
- Evacuation.

369
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,270
- Go! Go now!
- Evacuation.

370
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,390
This is not a drill.

371
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,710
- Evacuation.
- Go! Get on board!

372
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,510
Your attention, please.

373
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,630
Nonhuman presence detected...

374
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,870
levels 21, 23...

375
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:55,670
27, 14...

376
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,390
level 38, level 39.

377
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,070
Evacuation.

378
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,110
Proceed to lifeboats.

379
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,110
This is not a drill.

380
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,110
Thank you for your cooperation.

381
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,630
I'll give you holes, you slimy bastard!

382
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,630
Move it! Let's go!

383
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,990
Final lifeboat ready for launch.
- Get aboard!

384
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,150
Go!

385
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,590
Complete evacuation now.

386
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,950
Grenade.

387
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,950
Alert. Alert.

388
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,030
Evacuation incomplete.

389
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:46,230
Civilian presence detected
in area "H." Warning.

390
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,910
Main vessel
declared uninhabitable.

391
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,190
Elgyn, come on. Let's move, man.

392
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,110
Yeah.

393
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,630
Elgyn? Elgyn, where are you?

394
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,670
Elgyn, where are you?

395
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,870
Elgyn?

396
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:14,870
Elgyn!

397
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,590
- God. Elgyn?
- Elgyn?

398
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,390
Elgyn!

399
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,030
Elgyn!

400
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,870
Easy, Hillard!
Christie, give me a hand here!

401
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,110
- Get him up!
- Give me a hand here!

402
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,630
- Come on! Let's get him up!
- Move out of the way!

403
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,550
- No!
- Ah, shit.

404
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,190
- What the fuck did this?
- What's in this place?

405
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,790
- Call, get down! - What the
fuck is that? - Don't shoot!

406
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,710
It's in front of the hull!

407
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,590
What is that?

408
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:53,110
- Come on, man. Time to go. Time to go!
- Get back!

409
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,990
Damn!

410
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,190
Call, time to go!
Come on, Call!

411
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:02,630
Get the goddamn door open!

412
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,230
We can't open it!
We can't open the door!

413
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,390
- We gotta go back!
- I'm not going back! You go back!

414
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:42,310
What the fuck?

415
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,390
Was it everything
you hoped for?

416
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,470
Leave him alone!

417
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:00,070
What do we do now, man?

418
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,990
- Same thing we're doin'. We get the hell outta here!
- What if there's more?

419
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:08,950
I say we stay here, man.
Let the army guys deal.

420
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:11,030
Where the fuck
are the army guys?

421
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:13,430
They're dead!

422
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,350
Well, then we don't need
this asshole anymore.

423
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,270
- Step back!
- No, you step back!

424
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,750
- Stop it!
- You got no authority here!

425
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,270
Doctor, that thing
that killed my partner...

426
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:28,630
- that's your pet science project?
- Yes.

427
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,990
- Let me do him right now, man!
- I should let him do you right now!

428
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,470
How many more are there?

429
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,750
- How many more are there?
- Twelve.

430
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,830
- Twelve?
- Twelve.

431
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,310
Twelve.

432
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,390
There'll be more.

433
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,710
So...

434
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,790
who do I have to fuck
to get off this boat?

435
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:02,710
I can get you off.
Maybe not the boat, but...

436
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,950
- Let's get out of here.
- No, wait a second here.

437
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,950
She was the host
for these monsters.

438
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,350
Wren cloned her because
she had one inside her.

439
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,910
She's not human.

440
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:17,750
She was part ofhis experiment,
and she will turn on us in a second.

441
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,670
I don't give a shit what she is.

442
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,390
She's too much of a risk.
We have to leave her.

443
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,670
- She comes.
- We can't trust her!

444
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,270
I don't trust anyone.

445
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:34,230
If we're gonna survive this mess,
we all stick together.

446
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,230
Agreed?

447
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,710
Hillard, we gotta go. It's not over.
We gotta get to the Betty.

448
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,630
Make a nice souvenir.

449
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,110
I can't believe
you did that.

450
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,510
- Did what?
- Killed one of'em.

451
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,470
- It's like killing your own kind.
- It was in my way.

452
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:01,030
Oh, man!

453
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:03,350
Oh, no.

454
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,990
Who were you expecting,
Santa Claus?

455
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,830
- Thought you were toast
for certain, man.

456
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,470
Where's Elgyn?

457
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,790
Oh, shit.

458
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,150
Hey, man, what if we get to
the Betty and they're all over it?

459
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,790
All the activity's been in the aft sector
by the barracks. Why would they move?

460
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:26,710
They won't.
If they send anyone out...

461
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,950
it'll be, uh, here...

462
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,150
where the meat is.

463
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:36,230
Yeah. Well, I say if we wanna make any
decent time, I say we ditch the cripple.

464
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:41,510
- No offense, man.
- None taken.

465
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:46,630
Nobody is left behind.
Not even you, Johner.

466
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,350
- What's the quickest way out of here?
- After the cooling tower...

467
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,950
there's a freight elevator.

468
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,310
It runs from the top of the ship
down to engineering level one deck.

469
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:58,470
- Take us straight to the dock.
- Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.

470
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,990
We're moving.

471
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,070
- What?
- The ship is moving.

472
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:09,030
- I can feel it. - The ship has
stealth-run. There's no way you can tell.

473
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,070
She's right.

474
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,790
The ship's been go
since the attack.

475
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:17,830
- That's a standard emergency procedure.
- That's right.

476
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:21,190
Any serious problem and the ship
autopilots back to home base.

477
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,430
And you were planning
on letting us know this?

478
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,190
Nobody asked.

479
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:28,390
What's home base?

480
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,670
Earth.

481
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,990
Oh, great.

482
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,870
- You bastard.
- Earth?

483
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,790
I'd rather stay here
with the things, man.

484
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,030
How long until
we get to Earth?

485
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:44,870
- Three hours almost.
- We gotta blow the ship.

486
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,590
Call, you're not
blowing this ship.

487
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:50,870
Not while we're on it,
okay?

488
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:53,910
We get out of this shit,
you do as you please, all right?

489
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:58,790
Earth, man.
What a shithole.

490
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,470
It's clear.

491
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,230
Hey, Ripley...

492
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:24,150
I heard you, like,
ran into these things before.

493
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,510
- That's right.
- Wow, man.

494
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:30,790
So, like,
what did you do?

495
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,510
I died.

496
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,630
Not that way!

497
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,350
Ripley?

498
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,310
Ripley, come on.

499
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,110
Ripley, we got no time
for sightseeing here.

500
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,670
Ripley, don't.

501
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,670
Kill... me.

502
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,670
Kill me.
