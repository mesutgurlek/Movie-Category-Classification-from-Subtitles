1
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:55,715
-How'd I do?
-4:32. Incredible!

2
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:57,715
One last record
before I leave!

3
00:01:57,795 --> 00:02:01,955
Keep the stopwatch
I don't need it anymore.

4
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:06,955
Speech! Speech!

5
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:14,955
Where is my little Daniel?

6
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:30,995
Like you all know
Daniel resigned last night

7
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:34,995
He's leaving the 2 wheelers
for the 4 wheelers

8
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:40,755
Thus reversing the path of human evolution
that started on all fours,...

9
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:42,755
...and finishes on 2 wheels!

10
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,995
I want him to know
he was the best of all of us,...

11
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:48,995
...and most of all,
a very good friend.

12
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:51,515
You're going be missed by all of us you know.

13
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:10,035
Excuse me Lily, was that a kiss?
or did your lips just slip?

14
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:14,035
It's not that I didn't like it
but I don't know what to think...

15
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,875
Is it clearer now?

16
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:24,875
Yep.

17
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:29,035
They slipped again,
You must be really clumsy.

18
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:34,035
And now to celebrate
Daniel's departure,...

19
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:36,875
...I announce the big parade!

20
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:41,035
Open your eyes wide, Lily,
because you won't see again in your lifetime.

21
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:43,875
-How many are there?
-A lot.

22
00:03:58,115 --> 00:03:59,075
Here are the best.

23
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,075
Go for it!

24
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,915
Holy shit!

25
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,115
Excellent!

26
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:52,115
-A little party?
-Are they from the pizzeria?

27
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:57,115
-Bacon pizzas. -Excuse us but
we would like to see your papers.

28
00:04:57,275 --> 00:05:01,115
I'm sorry we left them inside
if you want we can go and get them now.

29
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:05,115
-Ok but make it fast. -No problem,
Thanks. lets run!.

30
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:19,195
It must have been 5 minutes now.

31
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:40,195
-Be careful - there could be some oil.
-Oil?

32
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:44,195
Yeah, it's my flat
but it's also kind of a Garage.

33
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:49,195
I hope that...

34
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:53,195
Hmm, its ...special.

35
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:55,955
-Daniel.
-Yes?

36
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:58,035
It's been 2 years
since we met each other.

37
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,195
Why did you wait until the day you leave
to show me your flat?

38
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:05,235
-I'm really bad at decision making.
-And what made you decide?

39
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:09,235
Your cleavage.

40
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,235
It's nice, heh?

41
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,235
The dress is brand new.

42
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,235
Ok then
we will try not to damage it.

43
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:21,235
Are you sure it's okay
after years just as friends?

44
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:23,235
We prepared the terrain well,
it's time to build on it.

45
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:26,235
-Maybe we could wait a little bit longer.
-No, if we wait longer,..

46
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:30,035
...you'll just get frustrated
and I don't want to be impolite.

47
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:37,235
-Oh, no.
-What?

48
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:40,275
-It's 6 o'clock.
-But it's Saturday.

49
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:42,275
-Yes, but I must go to work.
-What?

50
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,995
You just stopped working last night,
you didn't find a job during the night?

51
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,235
No, it's for my future job...

52
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:50,275
...an appointment I booked
a long time ago.

53
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:54,075
But you waited for our "appointment"
for a long time.

54
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,275
Yes, a long time plus an hour.
And when I say 1 hour, that's a maximum.

55
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:13,275
Hey, blue boy, you take a number over there.

56
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:28,275
Don't forget your photos next time.
77!

57
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:31,315
247. It's not even near my number.

58
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,275
-How long have you been a driver?
-25 years yesterday.

59
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:42,315
I'm retired since this morning.

60
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:46,315
It's the first morning I can relax
and read the newspaper in 25 years.

61
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:49,155
Ah I see.

62
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,355
Wake up number 247!

63
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,355
I am here!

64
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:07,355
Your form, 2 pictures...
sign here... and here.

65
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:12,355
Profesional Licence,
circulation certificate,...

66
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:20,315
...aquisition authourisation ,
the notebook, the plate and the sign.

67
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:27,355
-That's all?
-Yes.

68
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:32,355
-Nothing more after 6 years?
-You want me to sing "la Marseilleise"?

69
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,355
No, but a smile would have been nice.

70
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:40,395
248!

71
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:43,235
Lily!

72
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:49,395
It's 12:00, I went
to buy croissants...

73
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:51,395
...and, meanwhile, I married
the baker.

74
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:54,395
Goodbye and farewell.

75
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:13,395
Congratulations, Mr. Daniel.
You're welcome.

76
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:15,395
Yes, we insist.
Ok then...

77
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:57,475
-Hi, Daniel!
-Hey, Paulo!

78
00:09:58,475 --> 00:09:59,475
-You're working in tourism now?
-Yes.

79
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,475
Your party was great
we drank like hell.

80
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:06,515
-Yep, it was great.
But your bike sounds weird. Is it ok?

81
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:09,475
Isn't there a strange noise?
Does it work well?

82
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:11,475
Well?
I use super-unleaded.

83
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:15,475
I just ran from 2 cops, you should have seen that.

84
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,475
Ok I'll tell you, 2 police
on bikes on the Avenue.

85
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:24,435
Before they were in first gear,
I had made it to the beach.

86
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:28,475
They were furious.

87
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:34,475
I hit full speed and left them
standing. They couldn't believe it.

88
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:37,515
They won't forget
Paulo that easily.

89
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,515
They didn't forget you Paulo.

90
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:47,515
Hey girls!
still wearing the moustaches?

91
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,515
Go, Paulo.

92
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:03,515
Hey girls - going to the beach?
It's a free ride today.

93
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:05,515
You will love it.
Want to come?

94
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:10,515
Hey are you a "taxi",
or a nice taxi?

95
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:12,515
The driver
is super nice.

96
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:18,515
He opens the door, doesn't make you car-sick,
Doesn't speak unless spoken to.

97
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:22,555
-and he carries your bags if asked nicely.
-Thank you, perfect.

98
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:31,555
And where are we going Miss?

99
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:36,515
You see the pink house over there,
with a big door?

100
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,555
-Yes, I see it.
-That's where we are going.

101
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:47,555
Do you prefer any route
in particular?

102
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:51,555
Put all that in the kitchen,
I'll organise it later.

103
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:57,555
-You have enough food for a week here.
-Oh no, my son is coming for lunch.

104
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,595
-All that for one meal ?
-No. On Sunday he prepares...

105
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:03,595
...all his meals
for the week.

106
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:05,595
His flat is so small
there is no kitchen.

107
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,595
and he's unable to cook
even an egg.

108
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:11,595
Look.
that's him in the picture.

109
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:16,595
He's a computer programmer.
He works at IBM.

110
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:20,595
-Everybody has their thing.
-And you. What is your "thing"?

111
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:23,595
I love driving, but
you probably didn't have time to see it!

112
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:28,595
My son's taking his driving
test for the 8th time.

113
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:32,435
8 times!
8 is my lucky number. It will be lucky for him too.

114
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:37,635
At the end of the street,
we are going to take the first...

115
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:39,635
on... on ...on?

116
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,635
On the left,
Mr. Carbadec.

117
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:46,635
On the left, on the left!

118
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,635
On the left! Are you crazy? We are going to crash!

119
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:56,635
Holy shit!
In the 10 years I've worked here
I've never met such a complete idiot!

120
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,635
Can't you distingish right from left?

121
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:04,635
-Yes but you needed to tell me earlier.
-Maybe I should have sent a fax?

122
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:08,635
LEFT LEFT! It's not so difficult Man!
You turn a steering wheel and press a pedal!

123
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:11,635
I'm only doing my duty.
-And what is your duty?

124
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,635
Who the hell would hire a moron like you?

125
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,275
A circus; a zoo; BT or what?

126
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:19,075
Umm, a little bit of each...

127
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:20,875
"POLICE"

128
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,675
Ah you should have said it earlier.
Should I have sent a fax?

129
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:26,675
Excuse me.

130
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,675
Can I offer you something Mr.Inspector?

131
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:32,515
Thank you it's superb.

132
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:36,675
Thank you. You are so nice,
I'll keep your card.

133
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:41,675
I don't want to be rude but
I need to go work.
Is it ok if I eat in the Taxi?.

134
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:43,675
Sure go ahead,
go to work!

135
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:54,675
Can you save my life?
Basically, no.

136
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:59,475
Ok...it depends on your symptoms.

137
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:02,715
I have a flight in 25 minutes.
If I miss it I'm a dead man.

138
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:04,555
If I catch it,
you are a rich man.

139
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,555
Humm... you are lucky man...

140
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:10,555
I'm no doctor but,...

141
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:14,715
...I really like emergencies.
Buckle up please!.

142
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:49,595
Maybe we should go now.

143
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:55,755
Let's party!

144
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:30,075
A white taxi
doing incredible speed!

145
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:31,475
Screwed my radar!

146
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:33,075
We'll take care of it. Got his number?

147
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:34,475
No; didn't have time. It was too fast.

148
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:36,875
Keep your eyes open!
That's your job!

149
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:46,555
Do you think we are going to make it
on time?

150
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:49,795
If we're going to miss it maybe
we should take our time.

151
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:54,795
It will be ok, we are going slowly now,
but on the motorway we can get up some speed.

152
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,835
Ah I see, I see.

153
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,835
Don't take risks for me
I don't want you to lose your licence.

154
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:22,835
No problem,
I don't have a licence.

155
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:26,835
Oh fantastic.

156
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,875
14 minutes and 30 seconds.

157
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:47,715
Leaves you time to read the paper and
maybe a have a coffee. Have a good trip sir.

158
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:49,715
Thank you.

159
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:06,715
I don't understand.

160
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:11,875
On the computer I'm unbeatable.

161
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:14,875
First in Monaco,
Eight pole positions.

162
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,715
But on the streets
I'm a disaster.

163
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:20,875
Hey. How did you do?

164
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:22,475
Failed again.

165
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:28,915
No! You can't...
Champagne does get better with time...

166
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:30,475
...but this is almost
past it's sell-by date.

167
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:32,475
What happened?

168
00:17:32,955 --> 00:17:35,315
Hit a butcher shop.
Makes a change from a paper stand.

169
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:36,275
You know what?

170
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:39,915
You should put a Mouse in your car,
instead of your steering wheel.

171
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:43,915
Like the disabled.

172
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:44,915
Come on...

173
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,075
Emilien, we just got
another record.

174
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,955
A taxi, near the harbour.
You know how fast?

175
00:17:58,675 --> 00:17:59,075
140?

176
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:00,475
Yes - in first gear.

177
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:02,755
When he engaged 2nd:
217 Km/h!

178
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:04,275
You got it?

179
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:06,875
Do you think they called in the Air Force?
Imagine that speed!

180
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:10,955
Hey you heard the latest one?
Listen, it's funny.

181
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:13,955
What is the difference between
a comb and an egg?

182
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:21,155
Hey you are a lousy audience.
I'll come back later.

183
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:25,475
Yes, much  later, and if it's  night-time,
so much the better.

184
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:27,795
Next time,
knock before you enter!

185
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:32,795
Petra...

186
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,995
I didn't say that for you

187
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,995
Ok Emilien. So what happened
with your test, it went badly?

188
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:42,995
Ah, the news travels fast.

189
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:47,995
I've got news for you.
The Chief is holding a meeting, and there's only you two missing

190
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,075
Ah no... we weren't informed

191
00:18:50,475 --> 00:18:52,755
You just have to push that button

192
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,995
You see there; "Power".

193
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,995
You hear me or what? In my office right now!
Are you deaf Emilien?

194
00:18:59,115 --> 00:18:59,835
No, not anymore.

195
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:04,755
So guys, after hitting Dutch, Italian, and Belgian banks...

196
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,755
...the Mercedes Gang
just arrived in France

197
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,995
These Germans absolutely must not invade our territory

198
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:14,995
My grandpa fell into their hands. That makes it personal.

199
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:19,035
So the Paris-Berlin links and French-German entent can kiss my arse!

200
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:22,035
Alright? No I don't mean you Petra.

201
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:24,035
You are German... right, but you are a cop so it's ok.

202
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:28,035
And they have the gaul to nominate
a city before hitting its banks!

203
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:29,035
It's unbelievable!

204
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:32,035
In 3 days
it will be Marseille bank.

205
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:34,035
Red Alert,
24 hours a day!

206
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,035
We've got support
One driver per team.

207
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:43,795
When the Germans exit the bank, our teams will follow them...

208
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:47,035
...not losing them; twisting and
turning after them like a snake...
...before we strike!

209
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:50,035
Guys, this is why
this operation will be called

210
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:52,035
...Cobra.

211
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:55,835
Petra, Can you please assemble the teams ?

212
00:19:56,075 --> 00:20:01,075
3 per car. One driver of the GGM, one co-odinator and one sniper.

213
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:04,835
Each team has a code-name and a stake-out
marked on the map behind you.

214
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:07,075
The teams members are listed next to the map.

215
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:09,075
You have 50 minutes to get into position.

216
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:13,075
Excuse me Petra, that dinner date we talked about...

217
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:16,075
...this week would be nice,
because...

218
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:19,075
...the computer software I developed, that we've talked about...

219
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:24,075
...shouldn't be left too long.
Somebody could steal the idea.

220
00:20:24,195 --> 00:20:27,275
Oh no,..who can't wait?
You or the software?

221
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:28,075
Me

222
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:30,075
No! Him..It...the software...
the computer.

223
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:34,075
It's complicated.
This is why I thought...

224
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:37,115
...dinner...

225
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:43,115
As soon as the Germans are arrested,
I promise, I'm going to take care of you...

226
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:46,115
...of the software I mean.
Ah perfect.

227
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:49,115
Which team are you in?
With the Cobra.

228
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:51,115
Don't worry, you are lucky
I've put you in the best team.

229
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,155
Damn, There's no more coffee.

230
00:21:28,195 --> 00:21:30,155
Hey have you seen my steering wheel?
It's nice, it's mine...

231
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:32,155
...I bought it from Alain Prost.

232
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:36,155
with a new grip
special Dakkar.

233
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:39,155
Even with a load of sand in the car...

234
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:42,155
Oh yeah?
Too bad we aren't at the beach then.

235
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:45,155
Hey, don't smoke
It irritates my eyes

236
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,075
No coffee, no smoking...

237
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:48,155
No girls!!

238
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:55,155
Boa calling TinySnake.
I repeat: Boa calling TinySnake.

239
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:58,955
TinySnake here, I'm listening.
Yeah, it's Alan. Is your team any good?

240
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,195
Superb. We are exchanging addresses.
And you?

241
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:03,675
Somebody is about to piss on me.
Apart from that everything's fine.

242
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:09,195
Rachid, the small black Peugeot behind ?

243
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:12,195
Man! You're crazy Marco!
We are not going to steal a car during the day!

244
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:15,195
Oh yeah, why not?

245
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,955
Fuck, Marco! Its full of cops!

246
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:20,195
We don't know this neighbourhood, We should stick to what we know.

247
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:25,195
No problem, all the cops are at the airport!

248
00:22:25,315 --> 00:22:28,195
Theres are none for 20Km
around here.

249
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:30,275
Are you crazy?

250
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:32,595
Be calm man! All the cops are
at the airport. I told you!

251
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:36,235
I've seen it on TV. Clinton
is there with his girl

252
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:40,235
Hey Cops! Look at Marco
he kisses you

253
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,235
Lets arrest him.
No, let him take the car,...

254
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:46,235
...let him finish his little act,
We need a better view.

255
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:49,995
I need to take a leak.

256
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:52,075
No, we can't leave the car. It's orders.

257
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:57,235
You see? All at the airport like I said.

258
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:02,235
Smile guys, you are on film.

259
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:06,235
I tell you guys if they don't show up
in one minute with their Mercedes,...

260
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:08,235
...it's going to be coffee, smokes and a piss.

261
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:10,635
We're going to do all that later man!

262
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:19,675
To all the snakes... don't strike
until the mouse gets out of its hole.

263
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,675
I repeat don't strike until they exit.

264
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:26,035
Commissioner?
No Petra, don't disturb me now, I'm busy.

265
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:27,275
But it's the Minister.

266
00:23:29,315 --> 00:23:31,355
Mr Minister, aren't you at the airport?

267
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:35,075
We just finished.
Tell me more about that Mercedes gang...

268
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:40,275
We have located them and will grab them shortly.

269
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:43,475
Good! I have told my German colleague
that we will catch them right away.

270
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:45,035
The krauts won't get a chance...

271
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:47,275
...to learn much about Marseilles

272
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,275
Tonight they will be in jail.
Tomorrow I'll send them home...

273
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:50,275
...Special Delivery.

274
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:51,475
Hold on a minute

275
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,795
I don't want this to become
a settling of accounts between French and Germans.

276
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,795
The war is over Gibert.
Of course, Mr Mister

277
00:23:57,915 --> 00:24:03,075
I understand perfectly. They are criminals
just like the others, they aren't treated differently

278
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:05,315
Maybe you should start by not calling them krauts.

279
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:07,075
I called them krauts?

280
00:24:07,475 --> 00:24:08,275
Yes.

281
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:10,075
Krauts?

282
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:10,675
Yes.

283
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:13,475
My mistake Mr Minister.

284
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:14,795
I can count on you?

285
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:16,315
Yes, don't worry. Remember the Chinks

286
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:21,315
Er, I mean the Asians.
Everything went smoothly.

287
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:23,075
Almost no deaths.

288
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:24,675
At least, not on our side.

289
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:31,155
Hello? Hello?
He hung up!

290
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:46,195
You see, it's easy.

291
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:53,475
Where are the cables?
Shit, Marco! Hurry up!

292
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,075
Move the car stupid
or do you want me to bring you the keys?

293
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:04,755
We are the "Coolbras"
and in Coolbra there is the word "cool"

294
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:08,275
We going to be "cool" rather than poisonous ok?

295
00:25:14,235 --> 00:25:17,155
To all the snakes, don't miss them,
we want them alive.

296
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:18,195
At least for an hour.

297
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:27,195
I'm not really in the mood for this.
I guess I'd better leave you guys.

298
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:30,395
And...
I really have to take a leak.

299
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:39,875
Lets GO!!

300
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,235
What is going on?
Something's wrong Mr Minister.

301
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:50,395
Don't move Mr Minister.

302
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,235
Shit!

303
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:03,475
We've been ambushed!
Send us backup.

304
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:08,475
I identified the car...

305
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:14,475
I repeat, I identified the accomplice's car.

306
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:17,435
Four well-trained men.
Backup is coming Mr Minister!

307
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:30,475
Shit, shit!

308
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:58,515
Sir. I think we are shooting at cops.

309
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:02,515
Are they surrendering?

310
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:11,315
Hello, TinySnake here.
We had a small problem with the car door.

311
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:14,515
Good morning sir. Don't worry
you can go in 5 minutes.

312
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:17,875
No problem, no problem.

313
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:18,875
Thank you sir.

314
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:22,355
Here, there are giving up.

315
00:27:25,555 --> 00:27:28,555
Uh it's funny...  he looks just like...

316
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:30,555
Like the Minister.

317
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:37,355
You didn't eat anything.

318
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:39,515
I'm not really hungry today.

319
00:27:39,795 --> 00:27:41,075
Mum, no

320
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,475
Don't worry about your licence.

321
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:47,075
Remember your father, he never got one.

322
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,395
What? How come?
I remember him driving.when I was young

323
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:51,475
Yes, it's true.

324
00:27:51,595 --> 00:27:54,555
He took the test 20 times
At the end they just gave it to him!

325
00:27:55,595 --> 00:27:58,555
Thanks, I feel better now.
You're welcome

326
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:01,555
Here, David, the landlord's son,
asked me if you could repair that.

327
00:28:02,595 --> 00:28:04,315
Yeah, tell him my name isn't Super Mario.

328
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:07,555
I know your name is Super Cop
the one who upholds the law

329
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:10,595
...and protect citizens from evil.

330
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:15,595
Oh dear, it's a nice profession you do
I'm proud of you.

331
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:19,595
Oh yes!
That's why you tell everyone I work at IBM?

332
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:22,595
You want me to bring you all the neighbour's parking tickets?

333
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,275
No.

334
00:28:24,675 --> 00:28:27,835
Ok, you work at IBM
It's our little secret..

335
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:30,595
I get to fix all the neighbour's electronic toys.

336
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:33,595
Never happy.
Oh Mum, I'm kidding!

337
00:28:34,635 --> 00:28:36,075
Can you call me a taxi?
I will be late.

338
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:37,875
I just met a perfect one!

339
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:40,675
Friendly, pleasant, the cream of the crop.

340
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:42,075
You'll like him very much.

341
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:45,355
Hello.

342
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:46,995
Am I on the wrong floor?

343
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:48,635
Depends on who you are looking for.

344
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:49,675
Camille.

345
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,355
That's me...
Him, I mean it's here.

346
00:28:51,475 --> 00:28:53,075
Ah you're her son, the one who works at Apple.

347
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:55,595
IBM. IBM. Mum!

348
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:58,635
You know I don't know anything about that stuff.
I recognized you from your photo,

349
00:28:59,675 --> 00:29:02,635
Ah Daniel, meet my son Emilien.

350
00:29:02,755 --> 00:29:06,355
I've put labels on them
Monday Veal, Tuesday...

351
00:29:06,515 --> 00:29:08,595
Ok mom, I promise, I'll be ok.

352
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:11,635
Maybe we should go now
I get worried about leaving the car for long. Goodbye!

353
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:13,475
Kiss.
Kiss, kiss mum!

354
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:16,275
Where are we going?

355
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:17,075
Voltaire Blvd.

356
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:20,075
I remember the police station but not IBM.

357
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:21,635
We are going to the police Station.

358
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:24,675
I install computers there.

359
00:29:24,755 --> 00:29:28,675
If you don't mind, I'll drop you just before?
I don't really like hanging around the pigs.

360
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:37,675
You know it makes a nice sound for a taxi.

361
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:39,075
You know cars?

362
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:40,515
Just a fan.

363
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:45,635
It's a V6, a little bit modified.
It just loves to "sing"

364
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:49,955
Don't sing too loud.
The speed limit is 50.

365
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:51,675
You're talking about the signs saying 50?

366
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:52,875
Yes.

367
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:55,435
I thought it was for skateboards.

368
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:57,675
No, no, I think it's for anything that drives.

369
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:00,675
There is drive and "drive".
You see I'm at 100 in a good car...

370
00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:02,715
...good pilot, relaxed
No risks.

371
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:06,475
I'm less dangerous at 100
then that shit at 20.

372
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,515
There...

373
00:30:11,555 --> 00:30:12,555
See that?

374
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:14,515
Yeah I saw it!

375
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:17,075
You're not afraid of radars?

376
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:18,275
We know where the radars are.

377
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:23,675
Pigs are creatures of habit.
Always eat at the same places.

378
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:26,715
See, there's one just there.
You see them, they are stupid!

379
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:29,715
Picture! Picture!

380
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:33,715
You know they are only doing their job.
They just obey orders.

381
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:36,715
They volunteered,
nobody forced them.

382
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,715
Sometimes I think they were forced to join.

383
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:40,675
Because you need to be stupid
to join the police.

384
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:41,715
Look,..

385
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:43,755
...I see them alot
...because of the computers.

386
00:30:43,835 --> 00:30:46,515
The image I had of them was false.

387
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,555
Oh yeah? They're worse in person?

388
00:30:49,795 --> 00:30:54,515
No. They're better. There aren't
just plods in the police.

389
00:30:54,595 --> 00:30:57,715
Ah yeah, there's also alcoholics, crooks, idiots!

390
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:00,755
Seriously, between us...

391
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:05,275
...you know any normal person
who would want to join the Pigs?

392
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:07,355
And taxi drivers?

393
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:08,275
What about them?

394
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:10,755
You know anybody who
would WANT to become a taxi driver?

395
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,875
Those whinging guys who
only work when they feel like it?

396
00:31:13,275 --> 00:31:15,595
The ones who scream at us
when we don't have the right change..

397
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,155
...and get abusive when we don't tip them.

398
00:31:19,675 --> 00:31:22,475
Always sneaking around being
really chummy with the police.

399
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:24,275
Bunch of informers the lot of them.

400
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:29,195
And they all marry widows
just to get a free house.

401
00:31:29,835 --> 00:31:31,555
Are you married to a widow?

402
00:31:31,635 --> 00:31:32,075
No...

403
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:33,635
Ah I'm so reassured!

404
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:39,075
Ok there may be a few drivers
who are rude to customers.

405
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,475
But we are not all like you said.

406
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,475
And with the police it's the same thing.

407
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,795
They aren't all drunk at 6 in the morning,
beating up innocent people.

408
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:50,275
Some of them do their jobs
Just like you... and me.

409
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:52,795
Maybe, yeah maybe.

410
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:55,075
But the problem is that taxi driving
isn't my real job.

411
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:58,795
Ah you only do the taxi for fun...
What's your real job then?

412
00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:00,275
I'm going to show you.

413
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:31,235
Do you have a bag?
I don't feel well.

414
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,275
Don't worry. As long as we keep
moving nothing will come up.

415
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:45,875
Shit!

416
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,875
I'm sorry sir
it's the first time it's happened to me.

417
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:54,875
Usually the client gets out
to walk a bit...then...

418
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:58,075
I'm really sorry.

419
00:32:59,075 --> 00:32:59,875
I'm going to confess something.

420
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,275
I'm like you. It's not my real job...

421
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:08,075
Oh, no.

422
00:33:09,275 --> 00:33:10,155
Oh, yeah.

423
00:33:13,915 --> 00:33:16,275
Last name and first name.
Morales, Daniel.

424
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:19,875
Profession. Shall I write crazy taxi driver
or just crazy driver?

425
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:21,715
Whatever you want.

426
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:26,915
What speed were you doing back there?
A little 90.

427
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:29,075
A little 90.

428
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:30,915
It felt worse than it was.
The motor really kicks

429
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:32,755
but in reality the car doesn't go that fast.

430
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:38,915
Eh, world champion, how's it going?
Fine, very good.

431
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:40,915
Can't you leave me in peace?

432
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:43,915
Remember that taxi?
We saw it 5 minutes ago on the avenue.

433
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,915
Going 190 Km/h. He's slowing down!

434
00:33:49,955 --> 00:33:53,755
You see? Not 90... 190.

435
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:58,915
Must be the sun.
I didn't see the 1 on the speedo.

436
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,955
That's why I saw 90
If I'd known I would have slowed down.

437
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:08,955
Anyway 90 is illegal.
The limit is 50... for everybody!

438
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:11,955
Cars, skateboards,
taxis... everybody!

439
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:15,955
Are you happy now? Caught me.
Did your little job. You can be happy now.

440
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:21,275
My licence is my life
If I walk today I'm dead tomorrow.

441
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:24,955
Are you going to be cool and finish this quickly.

442
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:28,955
I'm going slowly, So I can enjoy it a bit.

443
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:32,355
Usually I'm the one being screamed at all day.
For once I'm in luck.

444
00:34:32,995 --> 00:34:34,675
I didn't knock because of my wrist.

445
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,875
It doesn't matter...
That you didn't knock I mean.

446
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:37,955
Thank you.

447
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:39,955
That dinner; your software that can't wait.
-Yes?

448
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:42,755
Can it will wait until
I don't have any scarves.

449
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:44,995
unless you want to have dinner
with a scarecrow.

450
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:47,995
I doesn't bother me...
you're perfect Petra.

451
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:50,995
It's not important... I mean no...
yes it matters

452
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:55,755
It's important.
it's very bad for you...

453
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:57,995
... but for me..
for the software it doesn't matter.

454
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:05,995
You see!
All day it's been like that.

455
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:08,995
If only I could catch
those German bastards.

456
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:11,995
Can I go now?
It will make you feel better.

457
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:17,995
No, I have to...
Unless you have an idea.

458
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:21,995
Can I promise not to do it again?
I said an idea, not a lie.

459
00:35:22,115 --> 00:35:25,035
I'm talkin about a real idea
of public interest.

460
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:27,675
You want to make me clean up dog shit?

461
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:28,675
No!

462
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:33,035
Something of public interest
for me. Understand?

463
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:37,795
It's like I represent the public...

464
00:35:37,915 --> 00:35:41,035
... and you do something in my interest.

465
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:43,475
You want money?

466
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:44,875
Argh you're really stupid!

467
00:35:45,155 --> 00:35:49,035
Tell me clearly what you want.
I've had an hour of your yapping.

468
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:50,475
What do you want?

469
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:51,275
Listen.

470
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:54,035
The Mercedes gang.
Rings a bell?

471
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:56,035
No. The only gangs I know
are on scooters.

472
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:59,035
They're a gang specialising in bank robbery.
Yesterday was their 7th.

473
00:35:59,155 --> 00:36:00,075
And that makes my boss sick.

474
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:01,075
That's bad.

475
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:04,875
Yes, mostly for us.
Listen, I've a proposal for you.

476
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:08,075
You're a good mechanic and driver
and I need a driver.

477
00:36:08,155 --> 00:36:10,875
That's 3 good reasons to hire you
as an intern for 1 month.

478
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,275
I tear up all your infractions.

479
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:15,475
You want me to be a cop for 1 month?

480
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,075
Choose, cop or pedestrian.

481
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:20,875
Death or Shame?

482
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:22,875
Yep, you understood well!

483
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,075
Here you have all seven
attacks in order.

484
00:36:28,115 --> 00:36:31,075
Don't know much about Mercedes.
I'm more Ferrari.

485
00:36:31,195 --> 00:36:34,075
Right now the gang is "Mercedes"
but as soon they get in Ferrari, I'll call you.

486
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:37,075
A red Mercedes. Horrible.

487
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:40,675
Yeah red, look for something we don't know.

488
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:45,115
We looked everywhere
but maybe...a detail.

489
00:36:46,115 --> 00:36:47,395
We just need a detail.

490
00:36:48,115 --> 00:36:50,955
Your gang.
They are German.

491
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:57,075
Nice! Mercedes: Germans.
Want to relax 5 minutes now? You must be exhausted.

492
00:36:57,155 --> 00:36:59,115
Tyres are overinflated.
Typical of Germans.

493
00:36:59,195 --> 00:37:03,115
They use 8-inchers.
That had to be done in Germany 'cos you can't find it in France.

494
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:06,115
The tyres are worn.
They will have to replace them soon.

495
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:09,115
On this picture, the silencer is a little bent.
But not on this one.

496
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,675
They must have bent it during a raid
and repaired it after.

497
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:14,275
The only mechanic in Marseilles that repairs these is Kruger.

498
00:37:14,675 --> 00:37:16,875
And Kruger
...is German.

499
00:37:21,275 --> 00:37:23,075
Lucky you're not a Mercedes expert!

500
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:26,075
Where are we going?

501
00:37:26,475 --> 00:37:28,955
We're starting with Kruger
to see if he remembers anything.

502
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:36,475
What are you waiting for?
You want me to sing a song?

503
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:44,275
In this neighbourhood, even the Chrismas lights get stolen.

504
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:46,475
What are we doing now?

505
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:50,155
We're doing what takes up 80% of a policeman's life...

506
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:52,155
...Observation.

507
00:37:53,195 --> 00:37:56,155
Familiarise yourself with the terrain,
observe entrances and exits

508
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:58,155
...and analyse the situation.

509
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,995
At closing time, we'll go and ask Kruger a few questions.

510
00:38:03,195 --> 00:38:03,995
When does the place close?

511
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:07,195
Kruger's? He never closes; he's insomniac.

512
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:08,995
Thanks!

513
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:13,035
They didn't have anything else.

514
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:16,195
Too bad we didn't stop by my mother's.
She makes terrific sandwiches.

515
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:21,195
Ham and Cheese.
Half Bayonne, half Parisian.

516
00:38:22,235 --> 00:38:23,275
It's wonderful.

517
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:25,075
She made you one?

518
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:25,875
Yeah.

519
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:30,235
A small slice of cheese in the middle
with lettuce.

520
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:35,035
...and pickles.
Fabulous.

521
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:39,035
That's mine.
Ah, really good, congratulations.

522
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:53,755
What's he doing?
That's a Korean driver.

523
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:57,715
A real pain in the ass in my job.
They work 24 hours a day.

524
00:38:58,075 --> 00:38:59,675
He must sleep sometime.
They are human.

525
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:01,635
No, they have a "technique"

526
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:05,235
One taxi, one plate,
one licence,...

527
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:08,235
...and 2 drivers.

528
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:11,875
Can you tell the difference between 2 Koreans?

529
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:13,475
Incredible.

530
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:24,275
I know a Korean who does food as a business.
Want some?

531
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:27,035
No. we wait until he closes his garage.

532
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,275
We'll be waiting a long time.
The guy is insomniac and never closes.

533
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:34,275
How do you know that?
The bar owner.

534
00:39:35,315 --> 00:39:37,275
Why didn't you tell me before?

535
00:39:37,915 --> 00:39:40,275
I haven't been in the police force long.
I don't have the reflexes.

536
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:43,275
It's not special to cops.
It's just common sense you idiot!

537
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,875
We are here two fools
waiting for an insomniac to go to sleep!

538
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:49,275
Does that sound logical to you?

539
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:54,275
If I'm the Mercedes driver
and I know that the mechanic is insomniac...

540
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:57,075
...I'll come during the night,
it's much more discrete.

541
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:59,275
Oh yeah? You think that the driver will just show up...

542
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:01,115
...with his nice Mercedes?

543
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:11,315
I don't believe it!

544
00:40:12,155 --> 00:40:14,155
When a driver's not driving
he's always in a Garage.

545
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:16,275
What are they doing there?

546
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:18,315
Probably the 8-inch
tyres they ordered from Kruger.

547
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:22,315
It's a miracle.
I can't let go such an opportunity.

548
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:26,315
If it goes bad, call the station
and give the Mercedes plate numbers.

549
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:28,315
Where are you going?
After information...and action.

550
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:31,315
The Korean trick.
What?

551
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:32,315
The Korean trick!

552
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:40,315
What an idiot!

553
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:42,315
The new tyres.
Where they are going to put them?

554
00:40:46,355 --> 00:40:48,355
What are you doing there?
Me? Sleeping.

555
00:40:49,395 --> 00:40:53,355
I don't have a house. My country is very cold.

556
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:59,115
Please! Don't hurt me.
I just wanted to sleep.

557
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:01,355
I'm going to take you to a house
where you'll sleep...

558
00:41:02,395 --> 00:41:04,355
and maybe even eat if you're lucky.

559
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:25,875
Hey you're hurting me!
I'm doing my best.

560
00:41:31,435 --> 00:41:32,395
What is your name?
Daniel.

561
00:41:33,435 --> 00:41:36,395
Oh, yeah. Daniel.
I'm Emilien.

562
00:41:37,435 --> 00:41:39,275
We should call each other by name, it'll be better.

563
00:41:39,675 --> 00:41:40,395
Yeah better.

564
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:45,395
Now that we are friends,
what just happened...

565
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:47,395
stays between us...

566
00:41:50,435 --> 00:41:53,875
When you let go of my hand,
will I be able to go to sleep?

567
00:41:54,435 --> 00:41:56,395
I'm no insomniac or Korean.

568
00:41:58,275 --> 00:41:59,235
Certainly.

569
00:42:03,435 --> 00:42:05,435
I waited for you all night.

570
00:42:05,515 --> 00:42:07,435
It was deliberate,
so that you would really want me.

571
00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:09,435
You won't regret waiting.

572
00:42:10,475 --> 00:42:13,675
Promises, promises.
Let me see what you can do.

573
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:23,435
Not too bad
a little bit more.

574
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:35,435
What? What is going on?

575
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:38,235
It's 6am and this is not Sunday.
It's Monday.

576
00:42:39,315 --> 00:42:41,835
You can't do that Lily.
I waited all night.

577
00:42:42,075 --> 00:42:43,475
And me? I played dominos

578
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:45,275
Can't you call in sick?

579
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:48,235
Sick on Monday morning?
My boss will really like that.

580
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,235
No one ever got away with that.

581
00:42:50,315 --> 00:42:52,235
It can happen to anybody.
Being sick on Monday morning.

582
00:42:52,315 --> 00:42:55,235
You went to eat at your parents'.
You ate too much...

583
00:42:55,315 --> 00:42:57,235
...and you puked all night.
It's possible, isn't it?

584
00:42:57,355 --> 00:43:00,275
A man who works all week
and goes missing on Sunday.

585
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:03,475
Do you think he can keep a relationship?

586
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:06,875
I'm so sorry, Lily.
I had a shitty day.

587
00:43:07,515 --> 00:43:12,275
I promise that if you come to dinner here
tonight I'll explain everything.

588
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:17,075
Ok, light meal
I don't want to be sick Tuesday morning.

589
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,875
A short time at the table and a long time in bed.

590
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,475
We could even eat in bed to save time.

591
00:43:22,515 --> 00:43:24,915
You'd better be good...
it's your last chance

592
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:27,075
I'm going to impress you.

593
00:43:32,075 --> 00:43:34,075
We're going to wait all day
in front of the garage - again?

594
00:43:34,555 --> 00:43:37,075
We're done with observation,
Now it's interrogation.

595
00:43:38,555 --> 00:43:40,515
Are you interested in seeing
a real interrogation?

596
00:43:41,555 --> 00:43:43,515
No.
You're going to come anyway.

597
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:47,515
I won't be any use. I'm better staying
with the taxi in case shit happens.

598
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:51,075
I need a translator.
I don't want him to bamboozle me with technicalities.

599
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:53,875
Kruger doesn't have a chance against me,
I'm telling you.

600
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:00,875
Good morning gentlemen.

601
00:44:02,275 --> 00:44:04,075
Which one of you is called Kruger, please?

602
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,555
It's written on the label
just like a waitress.

603
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:10,555
Mr Kruger, I've
got a few questions.

604
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:12,555
Don't worry
it won't be long.

605
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:41,555
Fuck I'm out of ammo!
What for? They are long gone.

606
00:44:41,675 --> 00:44:44,595
Yeah? Open you eyes.
There's nobody here.

607
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:46,595
Yeah, nobody.

608
00:44:49,635 --> 00:44:52,595
Can I ask you a quick question?
What?

609
00:44:52,675 --> 00:44:56,355
Are your interrogations
always like that, or was it to please me?

610
00:44:56,475 --> 00:44:57,595
Usually I ask at least one question.

611
00:44:58,635 --> 00:45:00,595
Let's get some air.

612
00:45:02,635 --> 00:45:03,675
You know, you saved my life.

613
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:04,275
No.

614
00:45:04,475 --> 00:45:04,875
Yes.

615
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:08,275
I owe you a big favour.
Lets forget that month's work...

616
00:45:08,635 --> 00:45:11,595
and turn it into a just a week.

617
00:45:11,715 --> 00:45:13,275
That your idea of a favour, huh?

618
00:45:13,475 --> 00:45:15,355
I need to catch that gang, it's important
to me.

619
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:16,875
Because of the blonde chick?
No.

620
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:21,395
In part yes,
but mostly for me, understand.

621
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:23,635
I'm tired of spending nights
sorting garbage.

622
00:45:23,715 --> 00:45:26,635
It's a question of honour.
Maybe it's crazy, but I need this,

623
00:45:27,635 --> 00:45:30,635
Can I have the night off?
You're kidding - of course you have.

624
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:33,635
Can I borrow him?
Mum...

625
00:45:33,715 --> 00:45:36,635
I lost my prescription
the doctor agreed to do another one.

626
00:45:36,715 --> 00:45:40,635
They are closing in 5 minutes.
It's my heart medecine.

627
00:45:41,675 --> 00:45:45,875
I won't let you die here.
This way I'll have saved the whole family today.

628
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:47,475
You're so charming, Daniel.

629
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:48,275
I know, I know.

630
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,675
Look Johnny, here they come.
Don't worry baby.

631
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:07,275
I've put a transmittter in that bullet
this way they can't get away.

632
00:46:08,675 --> 00:46:11,475
You're so clever Johnny
It's my job baby.

633
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:19,675
Now we just have to follow them.

634
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:22,675
Incredible!
...let's save your father.

635
00:46:24,275 --> 00:46:27,675
I'll never forget what you've done for me Johnny.
It's my job baby.

636
00:46:35,755 --> 00:46:38,675
Men,
we just received a call.

637
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,675
They're really baiting us.

638
00:46:42,755 --> 00:46:44,715
Gonna be the Marseilles Bank.

639
00:46:45,755 --> 00:46:48,715
Since they are so precise with us,
I'm going to be so with you.

640
00:46:48,835 --> 00:46:51,715
I won't tolerate any misbehavior...accidents
Nothing!

641
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:53,715
Perfect coordination.

642
00:46:54,755 --> 00:46:56,755
I have two words for this mission...

643
00:46:56,835 --> 00:46:57,715
Serenity...

644
00:46:59,795 --> 00:47:00,755
...and efficiency.

645
00:47:02,795 --> 00:47:04,755
So I decided
to name this mission

646
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:06,755
the Operation...

647
00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:09,755
...Zen.

648
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:13,475
Chief!

649
00:47:13,635 --> 00:47:16,715
Forget the TinySnakes and Cobras
I just got the idea of the century.

650
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:21,675
The Mercedes Gang will be nailed tonight
or I'm not called Emilien Barbadec.

651
00:47:30,795 --> 00:47:33,795
I hope your plan is foolproof
'cos this is your last shot.

652
00:47:36,835 --> 00:47:39,795
I giving you that shot
so be kind and don't miss.

653
00:47:44,835 --> 00:47:46,795
Everybody on the floor!
Quick!

654
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:49,795
Hands on heads!

655
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:52,795
Lie down! Don't move.

656
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:54,595
Come on!

657
00:48:04,475 --> 00:48:06,675
Hey you! Get your head down!
Don't look at us!

658
00:48:12,835 --> 00:48:15,635
It's working.
Good, very good.

659
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:22,275
Stay down all of you!

660
00:48:34,715 --> 00:48:35,675
Follow them at a distance.

661
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:47,875
So you won't be scared.

662
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:07,835
They stopped in Gauguin St.
We have them.

663
00:49:08,915 --> 00:49:10,875
Here is Gibert.

664
00:49:11,475 --> 00:49:14,675
All units: close off an area
10km around Gauguin St.

665
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:30,915
They're not moving.
Same street.

666
00:49:39,755 --> 00:49:40,755
What's happening?

667
00:49:42,275 --> 00:49:43,275
The dot disappeared.

668
00:49:43,675 --> 00:49:44,915
I saw it disappear.

669
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:46,275
I want you to find out why.

670
00:49:47,075 --> 00:49:48,635
They must be this way...

671
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:50,875
...a red Mercedes
doesn't go by unnoticed.

672
00:50:05,955 --> 00:50:07,755
They're close, I can feel it.

673
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:10,955
They are supposed to be here.

674
00:50:18,995 --> 00:50:20,955
Go, Go !

675
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:24,795
Don't shoot.
I'm the hostage.

676
00:50:29,835 --> 00:50:30,795
Emilien...

677
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:32,795
How...?

678
00:50:34,995 --> 00:50:36,955
I don't understand.
I'm missing something.

679
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,955
A red Mercedes vanished.
Even Copperfield never did that.

680
00:50:44,995 --> 00:50:46,955
Good Day. Papers please

681
00:50:48,995 --> 00:50:50,595
What is happening officer?

682
00:50:50,995 --> 00:50:52,755
You're German?
Yes, why?

683
00:50:52,835 --> 00:50:53,955
Is this the frontier?

684
00:50:56,035 --> 00:50:58,755
Chief, 4 Germans in a Mercedes
not red. Interested?

685
00:50:58,835 --> 00:50:59,435
I'm taking it.

686
00:51:02,035 --> 00:51:04,995
So you're Germans.
Yes, is it a problem?

687
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:07,995
No, it's good actually.
Open the trunk.

688
00:51:09,035 --> 00:51:11,995
What are you doing in Marseilles?
We came to spend Deutsch Marks...

689
00:51:12,115 --> 00:51:14,995
...but we can do that in another country if you prefer... No,...

690
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:16,995
...I prefer that you keep that
in our territory.

691
00:51:24,035 --> 00:51:26,995
Ok goodbye.
Have a nice stay.

692
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:33,035
Emilien.

693
00:51:34,035 --> 00:51:36,795
I don't understand, it's impossible.
I must have forgotten a detail.

694
00:51:37,075 --> 00:51:42,995
You see, he forgot the kettle.
You think so? That's not like him.

695
00:51:46,075 --> 00:51:50,355
It's 8pm. I've put on the answerphone,
set the alarm for 6 o'clock.

696
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:52,675
We've got 10 hours.

697
00:51:53,275 --> 00:51:55,755
It should be enough
I think it's going to be tight...

698
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:57,275
...but we can hurry a bit at the end.

699
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:03,835
Expecting somebody?

700
00:52:04,075 --> 00:52:06,875
Yes my lover, but when you turned up
I cancelled.

701
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:14,035
Who could it be?
Leave it, they will probably go away.

702
00:52:14,155 --> 00:52:17,075
Where were we?
I was kissing you.

703
00:52:18,915 --> 00:52:20,075
No you were kissing me.

704
00:52:25,115 --> 00:52:27,675
What if it's important?
How?

705
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:30,075
I don't know... the cops.

706
00:52:30,195 --> 00:52:33,075
Ah yes, if you were a notorious criminal
and they came to get you.

707
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:37,075
You could take me hostage.
Why don't you just take me?

708
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:42,075
Open, Police!
You didn't kill anybody?

709
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:44,915
No.

710
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:47,915
God, Daniel!
Are you there!

711
00:52:49,115 --> 00:52:49,755
Fantastic!

712
00:52:50,115 --> 00:52:53,115
You can't imagine the shit I'm in.
Yes I can.

713
00:52:53,195 --> 00:52:55,115
No, no you can't.

714
00:52:56,155 --> 00:52:58,115
It's gone, we don't have a flat anymore.

715
00:52:58,195 --> 00:53:00,115
The flat that my father gave us.

716
00:53:01,155 --> 00:53:04,115
Gone up in smoke, just like my father.
My husband smoked a lot,...

717
00:53:04,195 --> 00:53:07,115
...but he died of liver cancer,
we never knew why - he didn't drink.

718
00:53:09,155 --> 00:53:12,115
The flat is nothing! The worst
is that I messed up again.

719
00:53:12,235 --> 00:53:15,115
If I don't catch them by the end of this week
I'm back on the beat next Monday.

720
00:53:16,155 --> 00:53:18,115
Stick, whistle, hello kids !

721
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:20,955
I might as well die on Monday.

722
00:53:23,155 --> 00:53:25,115
Daniel, who's that dwarf?
A friend

723
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,915
Yes?
Playing with smurfs now?

724
00:53:27,995 --> 00:53:30,155
It's a bit complicated,
he's a cop... What?

725
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:32,155
You've got a friend in the police?
Not a real friend...

726
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:34,155
I work for him, because..
You work for the cops?

727
00:53:34,235 --> 00:53:38,155
No, not for the cops, for him!
He's not really a cop,...

728
00:53:38,235 --> 00:53:42,155
...looks more like a secret agent.
Something like that.

729
00:53:42,235 --> 00:53:44,555
And the old lady is Mata Hari.

730
00:53:45,195 --> 00:53:48,155
Can someone explain to her?
I can't do it.

731
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:51,155
Hi.
My name is Camille.

732
00:53:51,275 --> 00:53:54,155
The smurf sitting there
is my son, Emilien.

733
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:57,915
Do you want to show me the kitchen?
I'll make some coffee.

734
00:53:58,035 --> 00:53:59,075
and explain everything.

735
00:53:59,355 --> 00:54:00,155
There is nothing to explain mum,...

736
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:05,075
...I'm done, I'm on the street. It's finished.
But it started well...

737
00:54:06,195 --> 00:54:10,195
Then came the garbage bin, the butcher, the  Mercedes...

738
00:54:10,275 --> 00:54:13,955
What are you going to do about them?
Want me to call the real cops?

739
00:54:14,035 --> 00:54:16,195
Be nice, don't complicate the situation
OK?

740
00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:17,955
I'm not complicating the situation.

741
00:54:18,035 --> 00:54:21,195
I just want to finish
what we started.

742
00:54:21,275 --> 00:54:24,195
I don't want to waste an hour
because our schedule is quite tight.

743
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:27,955
I got caught at the harbour.
I mean seriously caught.

744
00:54:28,075 --> 00:54:30,195
I could loose my licence for 100 years.

745
00:54:30,315 --> 00:54:34,035
I help him and he gives me back my licence.
100 years of unemployment understand?

746
00:54:35,235 --> 00:54:37,195
Cop, Street-entertainer, Smurf

747
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,675
Nice job, you could have killed him
before he ever got back to work.

748
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:43,195
Here you go
it was stupid of me.

749
00:54:46,235 --> 00:54:49,235
I'm not kidding
you're free.

750
00:54:51,235 --> 00:54:51,875
Take it.

751
00:54:56,275 --> 00:54:59,235
Daniel, you know
I didn't came here for our deal.

752
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:04,075
I haven't got any other friends
Mum told me you had a big heart.

753
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:10,235
"Daniel has a big heart.
He'll help"

754
00:55:17,275 --> 00:55:19,235
Ok I think we made a mistake
it doesn't matter.

755
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:24,235
It's not important. It's not your problem.

756
00:55:26,275 --> 00:55:28,235
Don't worry.
I'll catch the gang alone.

757
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:35,675
On foot. Won't be easy
But I'm gonna do it.

758
00:55:43,315 --> 00:55:46,075
Listen, the best way to get rid of him
is to solve his problem.

759
00:55:46,315 --> 00:55:50,275
But he doesn't have "a" problem,
he's got tons.

760
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:53,275
Look at his face,
he reminds me of "silence of the lambs".

761
00:55:54,315 --> 00:55:56,675
You look after Mata Hari
and I'll see to the Smurf.

762
00:55:56,875 --> 00:56:01,035
I'll be back in two hours.
And what do I do with her for two hours?

763
00:56:01,155 --> 00:56:02,275
Do we play bingo?
Please, Lily.

764
00:56:05,155 --> 00:56:07,075
If you're not back in two hours I burn the lady.

765
00:56:07,275 --> 00:56:08,275
It's a deal.

766
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:11,315
Come on. Where are we going?
To solve your problem.

767
00:56:15,155 --> 00:56:17,315
I'm sorry to ruin your evening.

768
00:56:18,995 --> 00:56:20,475
You coffee any good?

769
00:56:21,475 --> 00:56:22,555
The best in town.

770
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:38,915
A little coffee to lighten the atmosphere
and to find forgiveness.

771
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:47,275
I know you don't want to talk to me anymore
But listen please.

772
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:48,475
Ok?

773
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:49,875
You have one minute.

774
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:55,115
I was up all night thinking and
there was one question I couldn't answer.

775
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:57,115
Why are they showing off to us?

776
00:56:57,195 --> 00:56:59,355
Why a red Mercedes
when grey is much more discreet?

777
00:57:00,395 --> 00:57:02,355
To get our attention:
look here, then...

778
00:57:04,395 --> 00:57:08,115
...it appears there.
It's a red herring.

779
00:57:08,235 --> 00:57:12,355
Conclusion: they left the building empty-handed
and the money took another road.

780
00:57:13,395 --> 00:57:15,355
Or maybe the money is still in the bank.

781
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:21,355
One minute. Show's over.

782
00:57:28,395 --> 00:57:29,395
I'll be back later.

783
00:58:01,435 --> 00:58:03,395
Ten grand.
Thank you very much.

784
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:05,675
To help pay the rent for the next few years.

785
00:58:06,475 --> 00:58:07,675
And my wife?

786
00:58:09,435 --> 00:58:13,675
You really want her back?
Well, I'm used to her now.

787
00:58:19,475 --> 00:58:22,435
Calm down dear.

788
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:26,435
Now, everything's going to be fine.

789
00:58:34,475 --> 00:58:37,435
One other bank, and we retire

790
00:58:38,475 --> 00:58:43,675
And for the last one, I suggest a real masterpiece.

791
00:58:51,475 --> 00:58:54,475
Emilien. Emilien!
Leave me.

792
00:58:55,475 --> 00:58:59,235
If I tell you how they switched
from a red to a grey Mercedes.

793
00:58:59,315 --> 00:59:03,475
Go on...
They didn't change car, they changed colour.

794
00:59:04,515 --> 00:59:07,475
A red Mercedes enters a carpark...

795
00:59:08,515 --> 00:59:11,475
...and a classic grey Mercedes
exits and drives away.

796
00:59:11,595 --> 00:59:14,235
It's possible.
Candy from a baby.

797
00:59:14,355 --> 00:59:17,475
If they did repaint the car
we would have found paint traces somewhere.

798
00:59:18,515 --> 00:59:21,475
Unless they used a truck
to spray the car in.

799
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:26,275
They'd need to buy loads of paint
to do that each time.

800
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:31,275
They did it really fast.
They had less than ten minutes.
Is there a paint which dries in ten minutess?

801
00:59:31,355 --> 00:59:34,075
Hello, Geg? Sorry for waking you up,
It's Daniel.

802
00:59:34,515 --> 00:59:37,075
I need your magic paint
the  MD10.

803
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,275
Metallic grey.

804
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:45,275
You ran out?
Who could have bought all that in one shot?

805
00:59:46,555 --> 00:59:47,875
At the "circuit des tangs?"

806
00:59:48,555 --> 00:59:51,515
Why do they want that much paint?
To paint the circuit red?

807
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:55,515
No, ok, don't worry
I'll try dealing with them.

808
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:58,355
Talk to you soon. Thanks man.

809
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,515
What does it mean MD10?
Dry in ten minutes.

810
01:00:17,395 --> 01:00:18,555
You like my theory?

811
01:00:25,075 --> 01:00:28,555
You think it's them? No those are the butchers
they train every Tuesday.

812
01:00:30,595 --> 01:00:32,555
Tell me Daniel.
what is your plan?

813
01:00:33,595 --> 01:00:35,555
What are you doing?
We are going to say hi!.

814
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:38,555
They are going to see us.
Yep, we'll make sure they don't forget us.

815
01:00:38,675 --> 01:00:41,555
They will recognise me
they got a good look at me the other night.

816
01:00:42,595 --> 01:00:43,555
Put that on.
Oh shit.

817
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:47,395
Is is ok like that?

818
01:00:48,595 --> 01:00:49,595
It's perfect.

819
01:00:52,595 --> 01:00:55,595
Hey faggots, everything ok?
Think you are Schumacher?

820
01:00:56,635 --> 01:00:59,595
Fancy a spin around the circuit?
What a cute little car.

821
01:01:00,275 --> 01:01:01,595
Mercedes?

822
01:01:02,635 --> 01:01:06,355
Thay build cars too?
Do Germans know how to play tortoise and hare?

823
01:01:06,475 --> 01:01:08,595
Don't know how to play?
I'll teach you.

824
01:01:08,675 --> 01:01:09,595
Give me fifty.

825
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:14,595
Maybe I should get out now?
No, you'll enjoy this.

826
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:17,595
The Tortoise and Hare works like this...

827
01:01:18,635 --> 01:01:21,995
...Fifty to anyone who can pass my car over two laps. One on one.

828
01:01:22,275 --> 01:01:24,395
You know how to count?
We don't want the money.

829
01:01:24,475 --> 01:01:27,395
I said fifty because I'd feel bad taking you for more.

830
01:01:27,635 --> 01:01:30,635
A tourist who doesn't get robbed
is not really a tourist is he?

831
01:01:30,715 --> 01:01:34,395
Check your rearview mirror in case I lap you
during the first lap.

832
01:01:34,475 --> 01:01:37,475
It will save you doing the second.

833
01:01:49,675 --> 01:01:50,475
Thanks girls!

834
01:01:53,675 --> 01:01:55,635
Get lost
Quick!

835
01:01:56,675 --> 01:02:00,475
I hate to rush off but
I gotta go to the garage.

836
01:02:01,075 --> 01:02:03,075
I don't know what's wrong with my car
It doesn't run fast anymore.

837
01:02:04,675 --> 01:02:06,635
Whenever you want a rematch...

838
01:02:12,515 --> 01:02:14,675
Here's your fifty. What are we doing now?
Lets get a drink.

839
01:02:19,515 --> 01:02:20,515
Frogs...

840
01:02:21,795 --> 01:02:24,755
You're crazy we had the gang.
and you act the fool?

841
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:28,755
We could have called backup and got them!
Yeah, on what charge?

842
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:31,755
Speeding?.. on a circuit?
Oh, the evidence

843
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:33,755
Evidence comes later.
We are used to that.

844
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,755
We needed to catch them in the act,
That's what you said? Yes or no?

845
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:39,515
For the moment it's us that break the law.

846
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:42,755
If we carry on, it's us who will be jailed.

847
01:02:43,475 --> 01:02:44,875
I understand ok?

848
01:02:46,075 --> 01:02:47,275
You're going to get your bust.

849
01:02:47,835 --> 01:02:50,795
They are all warmed up.
And nobody enjoys a game more than a driver.

850
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:54,515
Now we can set a
trap for them.

851
01:02:54,675 --> 01:02:57,555
Yeah? What kind of trap?
A trap for idiots.

852
01:02:57,675 --> 01:03:00,555
And what is your "idiot trap?"
Not an "Idiot Trap."

853
01:03:00,675 --> 01:03:03,555
I said "a trap"
Ok. how does it work?

854
01:03:03,675 --> 01:03:07,795
It goes like this
we bring them where we want.

855
01:03:07,915 --> 01:03:09,835
And that is: here.

856
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:13,835
We will need 20 Traffic Light keys
and 20 Super Walkie-Talkies.

857
01:03:18,675 --> 01:03:21,635
Walkie-Talkie ok
but keys, the guys always carry them.

858
01:03:22,155 --> 01:03:23,235
Except when they take their shower.

859
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:28,835
Oh no?
Oh yes.

860
01:03:28,915 --> 01:03:29,795
Oh no?
Oh yes.

861
01:03:56,915 --> 01:03:57,875
You're talented!

862
01:03:58,915 --> 01:03:59,875
Here you go, Jimmy.

863
01:04:06,675 --> 01:04:09,475
Will it take long? I'm freezing.
One minute.

864
01:04:09,915 --> 01:04:10,875
Emilien, I got one...

865
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:12,875
What are you doing naked?

866
01:04:16,915 --> 01:04:18,875
I'm not naked.
I've got a towel wrapped around me.

867
01:04:20,915 --> 01:04:22,875
And what do you care?

868
01:04:23,915 --> 01:04:25,875
I've got the right to be naked in my office, haven't I?

869
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:27,875
Isn't it my office?
Yes.

870
01:04:27,995 --> 01:04:30,915
No-one ever taught you to knock?

871
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:33,635
You'll never learn anything idiot!

872
01:04:33,755 --> 01:04:36,875
Oh, what a welcome
I wanted to tell you a good joke.

873
01:04:36,995 --> 01:04:39,915
Your jokes are never funny.
Get out!

874
01:04:42,955 --> 01:04:44,475
Ah! That feels so good!

875
01:04:47,155 --> 01:04:47,755
COME IN!

876
01:04:48,795 --> 01:04:49,755
Petra...!

877
01:04:50,955 --> 01:04:51,875
Am I disturbing you?

878
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:53,475
Never!

879
01:04:54,955 --> 01:04:56,915
Yes, I can see you're disturbed.
I'll come back later.

880
01:04:58,955 --> 01:05:02,915
The one time she comes in
with something to tell me...

881
01:05:03,955 --> 01:05:05,915
...I'm naked in the middle of the office.
You believe that Daniel?

882
01:05:06,955 --> 01:05:10,475
What can I say?
Anyway look at her...

883
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,915
She's so beautiful.
She's already a Sergeant.

884
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:15,955
What could she see in a guy like me?
Ho, ho. Enough.

885
01:05:16,995 --> 01:05:21,715
You done whining?
You've started digging your grave already.

886
01:05:21,795 --> 01:05:25,715
She's not a charity.
A chassis like that doesn't run on petrol.

887
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:27,715
What she need is a MAN.

888
01:05:27,835 --> 01:05:29,915
Straighten up.
You look like a monkey.

889
01:05:30,995 --> 01:05:31,795
Stand up straight!

890
01:05:33,995 --> 01:05:37,915
Now you go see her and you kiss her.

891
01:05:38,995 --> 01:05:41,955
You either get a slap in the face or
you get her for the next ten years.

892
01:05:42,075 --> 01:05:45,275
There's a 50/50 chance.
If it doesn't work at least you'll know.

893
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:47,795
It's like a game show.
You win or you lose.

894
01:05:49,995 --> 01:05:52,475
Are you ok, Emilien?
Are you ok?

895
01:05:54,795 --> 01:05:56,475
You are right.
I shouldn't worry.

896
01:05:57,035 --> 01:05:59,835
I've got to go for it
I got it.

897
01:06:13,475 --> 01:06:15,875
It was 50/50.
He will get other chances.

898
01:06:19,035 --> 01:06:20,395
Where are we with the keys?
Done!

899
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:23,235
Take them.

900
01:06:24,035 --> 01:06:25,475
You think she's going to be angry?

901
01:06:26,835 --> 01:06:29,395
A girl shows up 17 hours late.
What do you do?

902
01:06:30,555 --> 01:06:32,435
I kill her.
So you have your answer!

903
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:34,835
But we've got flowers.

904
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:37,995
Oh the nice flowers!
Can we smoke them?

905
01:06:42,075 --> 01:06:44,035
You bake all those cakes?
Yes.

906
01:06:45,075 --> 01:06:48,035
Since we couldn't make love,
we got revenge with cakes.

907
01:06:50,075 --> 01:06:51,035
What a crisis!

908
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:55,035
Thanks, Camille.
I had a wonderful day.

909
01:07:02,675 --> 01:07:04,675
Sweet smelling flowers.
Thanks. Goodbye.

910
01:07:07,075 --> 01:07:09,035
You don't want to make love?

911
01:07:09,675 --> 01:07:11,835
You have visitors.
You have to take care of them.

912
01:07:11,915 --> 01:07:14,835
Another day, another year.
It makes no difference.

913
01:07:14,915 --> 01:07:16,835
Camille will be in your bed.
Her back hurts.

914
01:07:21,115 --> 01:07:22,075
Good night boys.

915
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:34,675
God, it's good stuff.
Sure it's Jamaican.

916
01:07:35,115 --> 01:07:38,075
You see. It's not all bad in the police.
Stop it you are tempting me.

917
01:07:40,915 --> 01:07:43,875
Why didn't you race professionally
instead of doing it with a taxi?

918
01:07:45,955 --> 01:07:48,675
My father spent is life in a wheelchair
because of a car accident.

919
01:07:50,675 --> 01:07:52,515
How could I explain to him I wanted to be a racing driver.

920
01:07:53,515 --> 01:07:54,315
I see.

921
01:07:55,475 --> 01:07:57,275
And you? What did you do
to end up so badly?

922
01:07:58,675 --> 01:07:59,955
My story's not so bad.

923
01:08:01,155 --> 01:08:04,115
My dad died when I was 17,
We were alone, mother and I.

924
01:08:04,995 --> 01:08:06,515
So I had to go to work right away.

925
01:08:07,995 --> 01:08:09,955
Without a degree, only the cops will take you.

926
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:15,115
Where did you live?
At Asnires.

927
01:08:16,155 --> 01:08:18,115
At Jules Ferry?
Yes. Why?

928
01:08:20,155 --> 01:08:20,875
You too?

929
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:22,875
Yes, I swear.

930
01:08:23,155 --> 01:08:25,515
It's crazy
we could have ended up in the same class.

931
01:08:27,155 --> 01:08:30,675
I would have taught you to steal bikes.
You would have turned out better!

932
01:08:33,155 --> 01:08:36,875
Life is like that. You dream about so many things
when you are a kid but finally...

933
01:08:37,275 --> 01:08:38,475
...nothing goes as planned.

934
01:08:41,275 --> 01:08:43,355
You dream of playing in front
you end up goalie.

935
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:47,475
You think our plan is going to work?

936
01:08:50,195 --> 01:08:51,155
It will roll.

937
01:08:53,995 --> 01:08:54,955
Are you sure?

938
01:08:56,675 --> 01:08:57,475
Come in.

939
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:00,675
Am I disturbing you?

940
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:05,075
No, it's ok.
What do you need?

941
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:06,155
Red Alert!

942
01:09:11,595 --> 01:09:13,475
Guys, the Plan Couger is under way.

943
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,875
Their target is the S.D.L.M..

944
01:09:17,235 --> 01:09:18,955
Here are your positions
for today.

945
01:09:19,035 --> 01:09:21,875
Arthur, at the crossroads N 1.

946
01:09:22,275 --> 01:09:23,075
Jacky, N 2,...

947
01:09:23,275 --> 01:09:26,435
...at National Flamarion crossroads.
Momo at the crossroads de Le Bech.

948
01:09:29,075 --> 01:09:32,675
N 2, radio and key.
N 3, radio and key. N 4...

949
01:09:55,675 --> 01:09:56,275
Yes?

950
01:09:57,275 --> 01:09:59,235
I know. You'll be back in an hour.
...exactly.

951
01:10:00,675 --> 01:10:02,275
I'll wait for you at your place.

952
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:23,875
Cougar speaking
the bird is in the cage.

953
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,235
Everybody quiet!
On your knees!

954
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:35,875
Cougar speaking. the bird will soon get ot of his cage.

955
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:37,675
Prepare yourselves.

956
01:10:39,115 --> 01:10:42,275
Shit they have hostages,
Don't do anything for the moment.

957
01:10:43,315 --> 01:10:45,075
No more room for you.

958
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:46,475
Ok no problem.

959
01:10:47,315 --> 01:10:51,475
You're going to run next to the car.
It won't be too bad

960
01:10:52,075 --> 01:10:53,115
I'm tired!

961
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:05,275
Bastards! All Cougar units advance!
Catch the birds.

962
01:11:05,675 --> 01:11:06,675
Catch the birds!

963
01:11:29,195 --> 01:11:31,155
You see it's not the Mercedes we needed to follow...

964
01:11:32,275 --> 01:11:34,075
It's the truck we needed to follow.

965
01:11:34,355 --> 01:11:36,315
This deserves a toast!

966
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:38,275
And now we can all go home!

967
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:40,675
Cheers! Cheers!

968
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:53,875
Let's party.

969
01:12:03,395 --> 01:12:06,355
Everything's ready?
Twenty strategic points blocked.

970
01:12:06,435 --> 01:12:08,675
If they cross any of these junctions
they are caught like rats.

971
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,155
They're taking Michelet Boulevard,
they're going to Place Mazard.

972
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:13,355
Who's on that corner?

973
01:12:13,475 --> 01:12:16,675
Jean-Bat, N 7.
Call him. He will be the opening act.

974
01:12:17,235 --> 01:12:18,755
N 7, Jean-Bat.
You hear me?

975
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:22,755
Yes, listening.
You're going to be first. You in position?

976
01:12:23,275 --> 01:12:24,275
Yes no problem.

977
01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:25,875
It's our turn now.

978
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:30,275
It won't fit.

979
01:12:30,675 --> 01:12:31,475
Nag, nag...

980
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:35,875
Hey Bavarians, how are you
Still in your tractor?

981
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:39,875
Sorry about the last time.
I forgot the handbrake. That's why I was so slow.

982
01:12:40,435 --> 01:12:42,675
Hey I'm telling you.
It's a lot better now.

983
01:12:43,075 --> 01:12:45,475
Want to do another Tortoise/Hare or you just chicken?

984
01:12:46,435 --> 01:12:49,395
Ok, you Frogs
always got a big mouth

985
01:12:49,515 --> 01:12:52,075
Come on the motorway with me & we'll see!
Did I upset you?

986
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:54,275
I'm going to blow up your Peugeot!
I did upset you.

987
01:12:54,675 --> 01:12:55,675
I'm sorry, very sorry.

988
01:12:56,275 --> 01:12:58,915
I'll give you another chance,
but I won't bet much this time.

989
01:12:58,995 --> 01:13:03,395
I feel bad taking money from you so easily.
Here you go my baby, 10F.

990
01:13:04,435 --> 01:13:07,675
You're going to pay for your insolence.
Better to be insolent than ridiculous!

991
01:13:10,675 --> 01:13:12,075
I think you over did it a bit.

992
01:13:12,275 --> 01:13:14,275
Not at all,
Tell 7, 8 and 9 to go red.

993
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:15,875
Jean-Bat, go on red now.

994
01:13:40,275 --> 01:13:43,075
N 10, in position.
N 11, in position.

995
01:13:43,275 --> 01:13:45,675
Perfect. 12 and 13, prepare yourselves.

996
01:13:48,275 --> 01:13:50,875
This is N13,
I've got a small problem.

997
01:13:52,075 --> 01:13:53,875
There are two cops standing at the light.

998
01:13:54,075 --> 01:13:54,475
Shit!

999
01:13:55,075 --> 01:13:55,875
Move them!

1000
01:13:56,275 --> 01:13:59,075
Easy for you to say! They set up home.

1001
01:14:04,275 --> 01:14:06,675
We are nearly there. Sort it out
or we are done for.

1002
01:14:08,515 --> 01:14:10,075
Pollo, let me talk to the cops.

1003
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:13,475
Excuse me sir, it's for you.

1004
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:15,355
Hello.

1005
01:14:15,475 --> 01:14:19,075
This is Gibert.
We found a bomb and it's right next to you.

1006
01:14:19,515 --> 01:14:21,475
Where?
In the traffic light.

1007
01:14:22,275 --> 01:14:24,275
Stay calm
we know how to defuse it.

1008
01:14:24,515 --> 01:14:28,275
Listen carefully. Put the key in the light
and make the light turn red.

1009
01:14:28,475 --> 01:14:29,675
It's already red!

1010
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:32,275
Don't worry about the colour

1011
01:14:32,595 --> 01:14:34,515
...just turn the key to the right!

1012
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,915
Yes, yes, Mr Commissioner.

1013
01:14:45,075 --> 01:14:46,275
We've just passed 12.

1014
01:14:46,675 --> 01:14:48,275
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1015
01:14:49,075 --> 01:14:49,915
Let me do it!

1016
01:14:53,395 --> 01:14:56,075
19 and 20, get ready. 20 is the last.

1017
01:14:56,275 --> 01:14:57,075
I know.

1018
01:15:10,075 --> 01:15:11,275
Are you sure this is the right road?

1019
01:15:11,675 --> 01:15:12,675
It's a shortcut.

1020
01:16:12,635 --> 01:16:16,675
The motorway! They're dead meat.
We have more power.

1021
01:16:55,075 --> 01:16:56,835
What was that fence for Daniel..?

1022
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:58,675
The motorway isn't finished. It's a dead end.

1023
01:17:01,675 --> 01:17:03,875
The fact that you know that
doesn't reassure me.

1024
01:17:06,275 --> 01:17:08,675
I may look calm to you
but I'm crapping it here..

1025
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:09,675
Not long.now..

1026
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,475
That's what worries me,
I wanted a long life.

1027
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:12,475
Ten seconds.

1028
01:17:12,515 --> 01:17:13,675
Squash that rat!

1029
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:17,475
Stop. There's no bridge!

1030
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:18,275
Five seconds.

1031
01:17:20,275 --> 01:17:22,475
GO! Trash him! Trash him!

1032
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:24,835
Let them win Daniel.

1033
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:27,875
You only bet 10F. I don't want to die for it.

1034
01:17:28,075 --> 01:17:29,475
It's now or never! Hold on!!!

1035
01:17:38,715 --> 01:17:41,275
Excellent, Karl!
We won!

1036
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:44,475
Are you sure?

1037
01:17:54,115 --> 01:17:55,715
I swear, you scared me to death!

1038
01:17:57,155 --> 01:17:59,715
I really thought
you'd rather die than lose.

1039
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:02,715
With the tortoise and the hare,
it's always the tortoise who wins!

1040
01:18:04,475 --> 01:18:07,115
Einstein! You know "La Fontaine?"

1041
01:18:08,275 --> 01:18:09,875
That damn shit! Goddamn!

1042
01:18:10,675 --> 01:18:11,475
Damned...

1043
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:13,075
...shithead!

1044
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:20,675
The big hare is not happy to be
fucked by the little tortoise.

1045
01:18:21,595 --> 01:18:26,715
Cougar will be happy.
He's wanted to taste hare for a long time.

1046
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:29,395
Ja, ja...big hare
big hare.

1047
01:18:50,075 --> 01:18:51,275
I'm sorry about this place.

1048
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:54,075
It's not very romantic.

1049
01:18:55,275 --> 01:18:56,275
But I wanted you so much.

1050
01:18:56,475 --> 01:18:57,275
Truly?

1051
01:18:57,795 --> 01:18:59,075
I was starting to wonder...

1052
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:03,555
Shall we do it again?

1053
01:19:05,795 --> 01:19:09,275
Later.
We have to go now.

1054
01:19:13,595 --> 01:19:16,275
Daniel, What are you doing?
I've been looking for you for 15 minutes.

1055
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:18,075
What were you doing in the dark?

1056
01:19:18,475 --> 01:19:19,555
Developing photos.

1057
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:22,635
This is not the time for photos.
The Commissioner is waiting!

1058
01:19:31,675 --> 01:19:33,195
In the name of the President of the Republic

1059
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:36,875
..it is my privilege to present to you
the Knight's Order of National Merit.

1060
01:19:44,075 --> 01:19:44,635
Congratulations.

1061
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:55,075
I owe you an apology.

1062
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,675
For not believing in me or for slapping me?

1063
01:19:58,275 --> 01:20:00,275
Both.
Can you ever forgive me?

1064
01:20:03,275 --> 01:20:04,275
I'll think of a way...

1065
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:08,075
I read about your exploits.

1066
01:20:09,475 --> 01:20:10,075
Amazing!

1067
01:20:11,075 --> 01:20:14,075
This experience made us think.
Thanks.

1068
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:17,835
We are going to change the way we see the road.

1069
01:20:17,955 --> 01:20:20,275
...create a more efficient police force.

1070
01:20:20,475 --> 01:20:21,075
Modernise.

1071
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:22,075
All thanks to you.

1072
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:23,275
Thankyou sir.

1073
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:28,275
The medal is only a symbol.
It won't get your licence back.

1074
01:20:28,675 --> 01:20:30,075
I was hoping for more...

1075
01:20:30,275 --> 01:20:30,875
Mercy?

1076
01:20:31,075 --> 01:20:31,875
Yes, that would be good.

1077
01:20:32,275 --> 01:20:35,635
We had evidence to put you in
jail for years. But you are free.

1078
01:20:35,715 --> 01:20:36,875
I'm not free. I'm on foot.

1079
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:38,675
I understand.

1080
01:20:38,915 --> 01:20:40,875
Without a car
you are like an orphan.

1081
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:42,475
Yes an pedestrian orphan.

1082
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:43,675
I understand.

1083
01:20:44,475 --> 01:20:46,475
I have a solution
but I'm not sure you will like it.

1084
01:20:48,915 --> 01:20:50,675
Tell me and we'll see.

1085
01:21:01,715 --> 01:21:02,675
So are you happy or not?

1086
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:03,475
Yes.

1087
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:04,675
You're not happy?

1088
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:05,875
Yes it's super.

1089
01:21:06,075 --> 01:21:09,915
I don't understand. First Grand Prix.
First grid, super car, friends,...

1090
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:12,475
...beautiful girlfriend. What's wrong?

1091
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:14,475
The sponsor!

1092
01:21:15,715 --> 01:21:19,315
We find him money, a car
and still he's unhappy.

1093
01:21:22,555 --> 01:21:26,475
Tell the cheerleaders to stop waving their pom-poms.
It distracts me.

1094
01:21:26,795 --> 01:21:29,475
You know what you could do
to make me happy?

1095
01:21:29,675 --> 01:21:30,475
Yeah? What?

1096
01:21:30,795 --> 01:21:34,475
Win the race! It doesn't matter a damn
which sponsor's name is on the car.

1097
01:21:35,955 --> 01:21:39,275
Ok then, Take the Champagne out of
the fridge 'cos I don't like it too cold.

1098
01:21:45,955 --> 01:21:47,915
Let's go, Daniel!

1099
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:55,875
