1
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:39,580
Ooh, sweetheart.
Haven't got enough, you didn't order.

2
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,379
Well, I've only
just arrived, so tough.

3
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,819
Well, what do I do now?

4
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,180
Who is it? Dunno, some bloke.

5
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,859
You going to Slimbo's on Friday?

6
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,579
What is it, drinks?

7
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,619
Bit of a pizza, I think.
Might do, yeah.

8
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,059
What's happening there, then?

9
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,143
Move back, if you could, thank you.

10
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:11,420
Back you go, that's it, back
you go. What's going on?

11
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,779
What's happening?

12
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,420
Buggered if I know.
It's orders from above.

13
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:19,820
But the body's still in there though, isn't
it? We can't just leave it.

14
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:21,419
Move back, they said, clear the site.

15
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,059
Special access, they said.

16
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,940
For who? Torchwood.

17
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,100
Who's Torchwood?
Special ops or something.

18
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:50,299
Is that hot? Er, yeah.

19
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,179
They're not allowed in, they could
contaminate the evidence. How come...?

20
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,620
Don't ask me,
there's no procedure any more.

21
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:58,619
It's a fucking disgrace.

22
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,419
There you go. I can taste it.

23
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,179
Oestrogen, definitely oestrogen.

24
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,899
You take the Pill, flush it away, it enters
the water cycle, feminises the fish,

25
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,579
goes all the way up into the sky, then
falls all the way back down on to me.

26
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,299
Contraceptives in the rain.

27
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,139
Love this planet.

28
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,700
Still, at least I won't get pregnant.

29
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,500
Never doing that again.

30
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,500
How's it going?

31
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:12,424
Nothing yet. It's got to connect,
I've just got to feel it.

32
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,819
Hurry up! I'm freezing my arse off.

33
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,699
I can't just flick a switch,
it's more like it grants me access.

34
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,179
Whatever that means.
It's like... Oh, oh, oh!

35
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,059
Positions. If I get punched again,
I'm punching it right back.

36
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,220
Just, concentrate. Suzie?

37
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,420
There was... What was?

38
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:53,019
I was..
Oh, my God, I was going home.

39
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,284
Listen to me, we've only got two minutes
so it's important that you listen,

40
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:58,820
OK? Who are you? Trust me.

41
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:03,020
You're dead. How am I dead? You were
stabbed. I'm not dead, I can see you.

42
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:05,141
We've brought you back
but we haven't got long,

43
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:07,940
I'm sorry but you've got to concentrate,
who did this to you?

44
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:10,619
What did you see? Why am I dead?
Who attacked you?

45
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,899
I don't want to be dead.
Sixty seconds.

46
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,939
You've got to think, just focus on me. What
was the last thing you saw? I didn't see...

47
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,420
I don't know.
Who killed you, did you see them?

48
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:24,380
I don't know.
There was...something behind me.

49
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:29,580
Police said one stab wound in the back. So
you didn't see anything? No.

50
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,539
What happens now?

51
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,899
Thirty seconds. But he didn't
see anyone. Don't waste it.

52
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,540
What else do I say?

53
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,540
What's your name?

54
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:48,100
John. John Tucker. OK, John.

55
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:53,900
Not long now. Who are you?
Captain Jack Harkness. Tell me...

56
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,379
what was it like when you died?
What did you see?

57
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,059
John.

58
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,619
Tell me what you saw.

59
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,859
Ten seconds.

60
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,540
Nothing. I saw nothing.

61
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,020
Oh, my God. There's nothing.

62
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,780
Shit.

63
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:23,699
I said it was stupid, telling
him he was dead. Well, you try it.

64
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,780
"Trust me", like that's gonna work.

65
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:28,090
Told the last corpse he was injured,

66
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:31,940
he wasted the whole two minutes
screaming for an ambulance.

67
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:34,940
Maybe there's no right way
of doing it.

68
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:36,460
What do you think?

69
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,460
You still up?

70
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:26,980
In here.

71
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:31,380
They said on the news, murder in the
city centre, were you there?

72
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,779
No, I dunno, nothing to do with me.

73
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,979
How come you're still up though?
Banana Boat came round.

74
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,340
He was saying he's got plans,
he's off again next summer.

75
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:44,579
How come you're not pissed then?

76
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,579
No, we had a cup of tea.

77
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,459
He's read this thing about diabetes.

78
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,180
Me and him having tea,

79
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:55,699
that's middle age, that is.
There's some Chinese in the fridge.

80
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,899
No, I'm knackered. You coming
to bed? I'll just finish here.

81
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,540
This man's found his sister.

82
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,980
I'll see you in a minute.

83
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:33,539
Von, can you do a search for me?
Oh, join the queue.

84
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,724
It's a Captain Jack Harkness.

85
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:37,420
Could you check him out? I'm busy.
There's proper channels, Gwen.

86
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:42,980
What sort of Captain? Don't know. Just
Captain. If I've got time. Thanks! If!

87
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:47,299
Sarah Pallister, 72,
murdered in her front room.

88
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,260
Rani Ghosh, 45,
murdered in Robintree Alley.

89
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:55,899
And now John Tucker, 19,
murdered in Llangyfelach Lane.

90
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,097
So far, there's absolutely nothing
linking these three victims,

91
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:00,620
apart from the way they died.

92
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,140
As far as we can tell,
all with the same weapon.

93
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:06,380
A blade, approximately eight
inches long, three inches deep.

94
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:09,509
The women were stabbed from the
front, but Tucker from behind.

95
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,579
What does that tell us about the killer?

96
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,179
That he's a coward.

97
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,620
But those people last night, the
people in the car, who were they?

98
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:21,299
What's Torchwood?
Dunno, special ops.

99
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,939
Yeah, but what does that mean?

100
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,600
Bet you ten quid they're DNA specialists,

101
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:28,780
it's all DNA these days,
like that CSI bollocks.

102
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:30,739
CSI Cardiff, I'd like to see that.

103
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,659
They'd be measuring
the velocity of a kebab.

104
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,019
Thank you(!) Break it up!

105
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:49,420
Excuse me. It's all sealed off
up there. Who did that?

106
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:53,339
Thought it was you lot.
But what's it for, what's happened?

107
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,140
9am, it was all sealed off, they never
said. Chemicals or something.

108
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:09,619
Hello?

109
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:19,580
Sorry, I'm just looking for someone.

110
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,820
Right, yeah. Clever.

111
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,099
Anyway, I don't know if you
saw a man come through here -

112
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,380
a tall man, in one of those
big sort of military coats.

113
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,380
OK. If you could answer?
This is official business.

114
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,860
You all right?

115
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:11,980
That's good.
That's a good mask sort of thing.

116
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:16,780
Look, I'm sorry if I'm
interrupting something, but...

117
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:19,340
I think we can stop this now, OK?

118
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:24,499
It's all very well playing silly
buggers, but I'm busy, all right?

119
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,219
Now, I'm looking for a man
in a big grey coat.

120
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:34,779
I said we can stop being silly.

121
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,929
Ah, there you are, I did ask when I saw Dr

122
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,380
Mahib cos I thought it
was him who said about

123
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:42,429
the police, but he said no,

124
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,419
then I said about the chemicals but he
said don't be stupid, what chemicals?

125
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,489
So I don't know, could be anything,
who've you got with you there then?

126
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,700
So much for sealing it off.

127
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,619
Ooh, there's a face!

128
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,180
Nice one. Hey, I tell you mate, you should
try plastic surgery. Not on the NHS mind!

129
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:01,300
You all right? Yeah.

130
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:04,699
Bloody hell, that is brilliant.

131
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,940
That's like, em, Hellraiser.

132
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:12,580
That's first class, that is. Look at
that, it's just like real teeth.

133
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:20,019
Go! Go! Go!

134
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:19,060
Registration - Charlie Foxtrot
Zero Six Foxtrot Delta Uniform.

135
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:21,714
Charlie Foxtrot Zero Six
Foxtrot Delta Uniform.

136
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:23,860
Hold on. I think Yvonne wants a word.

137
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:25,940
No sign of a Captain Jack Harkness.

138
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:28,020
Did you search outside Cardiff?

139
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:31,580
No, that never occurred to me(!)
Of course I did. I went nationwide.

140
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:35,544
There's about 15 Jacks and Johns with
that surname, none of them's a captain.

141
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:36,779
He could've made it up.

142
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,739
The only Captain Jack Harkness
on record was American.

143
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,579
That's it, he's American! Which you forgot
to tell me. So who is he?

144
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,500
American volunteer, Royal Air Force,
133 Squadron. Except he disappeared.

145
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:50,740
Vanished off the records.
Presumed dead. When was that?

146
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:52,780
1941. At the height of the Blitz.

147
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:58,099
On the morning of January 21 1941, Captain
Jack Harkness failed to report for duty,

148
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,340
never seen again, till now.

149
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:03,620
What's going on, Gwen,
you seeing ghosts?

150
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,980
You lot! Oi!

151
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:23,739
Torchwood!

152
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,191
You can't leave that there.

153
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:28,900
Police. I can see that, love, and
you're still not leaving it there.

154
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,779
I'm talking to you. Excuse me!

155
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,380
Move your bloody car...

156
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,580
Did you get anything
on that registration?

157
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,819
No such number.

158
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,619
What does that mean?

159
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,987
Doesn't exist. Double checked with Swansea,

160
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:57,740
triple-checked, there's
nothing, no such vehicle.

161
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:00,860
But Temple's been asking about
you, Gwen. Are you in trouble?

162
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,740
I have walked.

163
00:15:05,741 --> 00:15:08,020
I have bloody walked.

164
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,899
They were here,
and then they were gone.

165
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,100
And look, there's nowhere to hide.
They just disappeared.

166
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:18,860
Temple's not just livid,
he's doing his nut.

167
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:27,579
There was a man, I'm telling you, there was
this porter, he was in a porter's uniform,

168
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,580
and he was killed,
or at least he was injured,

169
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,118
he must've been injured,

170
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:36,539
right in front of me, this man in
a mask, sort of lashed out, and...

171
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,339
And I've told you, all
hospital staff, present and correct.

172
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,460
I saw it. That's it? Gwen, sweetheart,
think about it, what sort of story is that?

173
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,619
You're not well. Come with me.
I'll take you home.

174
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,100
They were here. Come on.

175
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,700
Look at me! Hot pot!

176
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:18,779
Or, as the French call it, ho po.

177
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,700
Oh, I should've phoned.
I've got to work.

178
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,699
You should be off sick.

179
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,779
I know, but they were short
and there's a match on tonight,

180
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,939
so I said I'd take another shift.
I'm sorry.

181
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,419
Forgive me.

182
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,700
Go on, forgive me. Say you
forgive me, you do, don't you?

183
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,340
OK I got to go.

184
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,500
Excuse me, Gwen Cooper, CID.

185
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,500
I'm making some enquiries round the Bay.

186
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:35,500
I need to check some people out
on your list, if that's OK.

187
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:38,980
I don't suppose you deliver
to a Captain Jack Harkness?

188
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:41,699
I dunno.
Well, could you have a look?

189
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,100
Nope.

190
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,420
He's not a regular anyway.

191
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:49,700
J Harkness? Or just Harkness?

192
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,179
No.

193
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,300
OK. Never mind. Thanks anyway.

194
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:06,314
I don't suppose you've got a Torchwood?
Oh, aye, we do them all the time.

195
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:07,700
They're good customers.

196
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,545
Oh, hiya. Sorry I'm late.

197
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:46,139
Someone ordered pizza. Who's it for?
I think it's a...Mr Harkness.

198
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,940
Don't keep them waiting.

199
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,140
I can't do this, I'm sorry.

200
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,900
I'm rubbish. I give up!

201
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:14,020
He set me off. Well, that lasted
nought point two seconds.

202
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:16,780
She's actually carrying pizza!

203
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:18,147
Come on! She was gonna say,

204
00:21:18,148 --> 00:21:21,740
"Here's your pizza," and I was going
to say, "How much?" and she says,

205
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:23,939
"Oh, whatever, twenty quid,"

206
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,140
and I say, "Oh, I don't have any
money." I was working on a punchline.

207
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:31,020
I'd have got there.
But it would've been good!

208
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:34,340
There's your pizza. I'd better go.
We've gone past that stage.

209
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:35,965
You must've been freezing out there.

210
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:38,899
How long were you walking around?
Three hours? You could see me?

211
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,540
And before we go any further, who the hell
orders pizza under the name of Torchwood?

212
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:47,419
Me. I'm sorry. I'm a twat.

213
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:53,499
That man, at the hospital,
that porter, what happened to him?

214
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:59,180
That was real, wasn't it? He was attacked.
He's dead. But there's no-one gone missing.

215
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:01,417
We took the body, changed the work rota,

216
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:04,660
planted a false witness who
saw him leaving the hospital,

217
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,259
giving him an alibi
for the next 48 hours,

218
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,058
so when his body's pulled out of
the docks next Tuesday night,

219
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:11,819
he's only been missing for three days.

220
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,299
He was murdered? Yes. And you
covered it up? That's my job.

221
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,285
And that other man, John Tucker?
Last night in the alleyway,

222
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:23,060
I saw you. And what did you see?

223
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:25,820
You revived him. No.

224
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:28,739
What did you see?
You resuscitated him.

225
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,459
No, what did you see?

226
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,780
You brought him back to life. Yeah.

227
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:39,260
Who are you?

228
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:43,980
Torchwood. What's Torchwood?
This is Torchwood.

229
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:46,900
All around you.

230
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:51,820
And what happens to me? I'm police.
Constable Gwen Cooper.

231
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:54,259
You can't do anything.

232
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,420
Right then, PC Cooper...

233
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,700
..d'you want to come see?

234
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:05,380
See what? You saw the murder.

235
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,980
Come and see the murderer.

236
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,859
Go with him.

237
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,340
What is Torchwood? Who are you? What is
this place? SCREECHING

238
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:26,780
What was that? Pterodactyl.

239
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,779
Are you coming?

240
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,299
It's all right -
it's safe, it's sedated.

241
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,020
It's called a Weevil.

242
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,219
Or at least, we call them Weevils.

243
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,100
We don't know their real name, cos they're
not too good at communicating.

244
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:08,796
But we've got a couple of hundred of them in

245
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:11,860
the city living in the sewers,
feeding off the...

246
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:14,219
Well, it's the sewers,

247
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,020
you can guess.

248
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:21,539
But every once in a while, one of them goes
rogue, comes to the surface, attacks.

249
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,180
Actually, it's been happening more
and more and we have no idea why.

250
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:28,539
But it's alien.

251
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,579
Look into its eyes.

252
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,539
There you go.

253
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,620
Take your time.

254
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,659
It was born on a different world

255
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,540
and it's real.

256
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,459
Owen Harper, Gwen Cooper.
"Doctor" Owen Harper, thank you.

257
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,419
Toshiko Sato, Suzie Costello,
she's second-in-command.

258
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,349
And this is Ianto Jones,

259
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:20,140
Ianto cleans up after us and gets us
everywhere on time. I try my best.

260
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:23,620
And he looks good in a suit.
Careful, that's harassment, sir.

261
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:25,859
Why are you telling me their names?

262
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,860
I'm not supposed to know, am I? This is
classified, isn't it? Way beyond classified.

263
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:34,340
Then you shouldn't be telling me.
What are you gonna do to me?

264
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:36,897
What d'you imagine? Well,
I've seen too much.

265
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:39,739
Your names and everything,
and the Weevil, and...

266
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,980
You can dump a man in the water
and lie about his death.

267
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:46,030
OK! Tosh, finish that calibration
tomorrow morning.

268
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:49,140
Owen, first thing, get a
hold of Chandler and Bell,

269
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:50,574
cos I think they're lying.

270
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:54,379
Ianto, if he needs back-up, then you'd
better be on stand-by. Suzie,

271
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,998
I know it's a pain in the ass,

272
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:59,939
but I need the costing on the glove
research, and you're coming with me.

273
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:05,620
I'm getting tired of following you.

274
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:09,420
No you're not, and you never will.

275
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,259
Stand on here. C'mon, next to me.

276
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,540
Good night!

277
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:20,140
Now, you came in
through the front door.

278
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:23,020
Let's take the scenic route.

279
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,220
But they can see the lift.

280
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:06,900
Why aren't they...?

281
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:10,299
We're right out in the open.
They can see everything!

282
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,680
Do they look like they
can see us? No, but...

283
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:15,379
Look at us! We couldn't be
any more public! Hello!

284
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,500
Hey, you there, hello!

285
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:23,739
It's called a perception filter. He can
sort of see us, but we don't quite register.

286
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,500
Just like something
in the corner of your eye.

287
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:33,539
It only works on this exact spot.
Step off... Hi! Nice night!

288
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,620
And lo, we are perceived.

289
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:41,540
How does it work? No idea. We know
how to use it, not how it happens.

290
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:43,454
But if I were to guess,
I'd say that there was

291
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,700
once a dimensionally transcendental
chameleon-circuit

292
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:48,672
placed right on this spot which welded its

293
00:27:48,673 --> 00:27:52,139
perception properties to
a spatio-temporal rift.

294
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,340
But that sounds kind of ridiculous.

295
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:57,006
"Invisible lift" has got
more of a ring to it.

296
00:27:57,007 --> 00:28:00,019
But if no-one can see it
when the lift's coming up,

297
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,299
there's a bloody big hole in
the floor, don't people fall in?

298
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,540
That is so Welsh. What is?

299
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:08,939
I show you something fantastic -
you find fault.

300
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,899
I just don't understand...
I tell you what I don't understand.

301
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,500
You're gonna rattle on with that,

302
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:39,460
"How can this be true?" What's
it gonna take for you people?

303
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:41,019
If you want evidence of aliens,

304
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,539
how about that great spaceship hovering
over London on Christmas Day?

305
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,459
What about the battle of Canary
Wharf? A Cyberman in every home!

306
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,151
My boyfriend says it's like
a sort of terrorism.

307
00:28:50,152 --> 00:28:52,619
Like they put drugs in the water supplies -

308
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,940
psychotropic drugs, causing
mass hallucinations and stuff.

309
00:28:56,941 --> 00:29:00,460
Yeah, well your boyfriend's stupid.
Oh, you've met him?

310
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,139
So...you catch aliens?

311
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,299
Yup. You catch aliens for a living?

312
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,740
Yes, we do. You're an alien-catcher?
Yes, I am. Caught any good aliens?

313
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:18,299
Tons of 'em! That's hell of a job.
Sure is.

314
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,860
This is so weird.

315
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:31,619
And who are you, then?
Captain Jack Harkness.

316
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,539
I did some research and there's only one
Captain Jack Harkness on record.

317
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:43,699
And he disappeared in 1941. Well...
that couldn't be me...could it?

318
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:49,859
We don't just catch aliens.

319
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,180
We scavenge the stuff
they leave behind.

320
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:55,660
Find ways of using it.
Arming the human race for the future.

321
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:59,431
The twenty-first century is when it all
changes, and you've got to be ready.

322
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:00,820
But who's in charge of you?

323
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:05,260
We're separate from the government. Outside
the police. Beyond the United Nations.

324
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,820
Cos if one power got hold of this stuff,

325
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:11,660
they could use it for their own
purposes. But so could you.

326
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:16,859
All alien technology stays on the base.
No-one's allowed to take anything outside.

327
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:56,459
So go on, then. How the hell
did you end up in Cardiff?

328
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:02,339
This is Torchwood Three. Torchwood One was
London, destroyed in the battle.

329
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,419
Torchwood Two is an office
in Glasgow, very strange man.

330
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,756
Torchwood three, Cardiff.

331
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:12,180
Torchwood Four's kinda gone missing,
but we'll find it one day.

332
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:14,139
So you just fancied Cardiff?

333
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,139
There's a rift in space and time
running right through the city.

334
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,499
The Weevils didn't come in a
spaceship. They just slip through.

335
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,740
All sorts of things
get washed up here.

336
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:29,143
Creatures, timeshifts, space junk,
debris, flotsam and jetsam.

337
00:31:29,144 --> 00:31:31,060
Sounds like Cardiff, yeah.

338
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:33,700
Hey, don't knock it, I'm a citizen.

339
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:35,860
But where are you from?

340
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:39,340
All sorts of places.

341
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:41,620
Thing is, we could liaise on this...

342
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:46,660
the serial killer. I could be like
your liaison with the police.

343
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:49,179
Right, I can see the mistake.

344
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,219
You think because we showed up
we're out to catch the killer.

345
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,019
Sorry. Nothing to do with us. Then what
were you doing there? Testing the glove.

346
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,899
We need murder victims, simple as that. The
glove only works on the recently deceased,

347
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,251
and the more violent the trauma,
the stronger the resurrection.

348
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:06,259
All we need is fresh meat.

349
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,840
No, you were asking that man,

350
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:11,220
John Tucker, I saw you, you were
asking him about his killer.

351
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,361
He'd just been murdered,

352
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:15,500
what else are you gonna ask? You
could get an ID. You could help.

353
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:20,460
We're busy. And your work is more
important? Now you've got it.

354
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:21,750
Well, that's tough shit.

355
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:25,620
Cos if you let me go, then I have a
duty, cos that glove could help us.

356
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,539
If you remember. What d'you mean?

357
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,740
How's your drink?

358
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:42,340
Have you poisoned me? Don't be so
dramatic. It's an amnesia pill.

359
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:45,339
My own recipe, with a touch
of denial and a dash of retcon.

360
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,699
Wake up tomorrow morning, you'll have
forgotten everything about Torchwood.

361
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,740
Worse still,
you'll have forgotten me...

362
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,219
..which is kind of tragic.

363
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,219
Don't think you can fight it
by staying awake.

364
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,340
I mixed in a little
bit of sedative too.

365
00:33:06,341 --> 00:33:10,939
Then I'll tell someone! D'you really
want us to come and find them too?

366
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,900
You bastard. Language!

367
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:16,300
Nice knowing you, Gwen Cooper.

368
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:14,339
Hello. All right?

369
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:20,459
You having a good time? I was.
Can I buy you a drink?

370
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,259
No, thanks, I'm fine.

371
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:26,980
Am I wasting my time?

372
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,020
I dunno, are you?

373
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,246
I've got to be up early and
I've got hell of a day

374
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:37,979
tomorrow and I can't be bothered
with all the chat.

375
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,059
So...do you want a drink or what?

376
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:03,020
Bloody hell fire. You're coming
home with me, you are. Right now!

377
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:18,380
Oi, you bastard, come here! Linda, what the
fuck do you think you are doing?!

378
00:36:18,381 --> 00:36:21,179
I'm taking him home
and I'm having him, now piss off!

379
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,056
What the fuck d'you think you're
doing with my girlfriend? Hey,

380
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,700
she was on her own. She never said.

381
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:29,380
You fucking tosser.
Colin, button it, he's mine.

382
00:36:29,381 --> 00:36:33,551
Do you want to have a go? You want to
have a go? Come on then mate! Well,

383
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:34,979
if it makes it easier...

384
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,020
I am so having you.

385
00:36:44,021 --> 00:36:46,540
I'm having him first! Taxi!

386
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:28,460
Did you get pissed? No.

387
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:31,579
What time is it?

388
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,220
Seven thirty.

389
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:37,780
You said you were working
last night. I was.

390
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:40,259
Then how come
you fell asleep in here?

391
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,300
I haven't, I was...typing.

392
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:46,619
That is work.

393
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,300
I'm not having a go, I'm just saying.

394
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:53,219
Not exactly clever going out on the lash
when you've just had a bang on the head.

395
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,619
I hope you didn't drive in that
state. Who were you with? Diane?

396
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,180
Must've been. Yeah.

397
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:08,179
Have any luck? With what?

398
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,379
Captain Jack Harkness.

399
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,620
How d'you mean? Who's he? Oh,

400
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:17,179
well don't worry about me, just
go ahead, wasting my time.

401
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:32,540
Aye, aye. Come to see
where the real work's done?

402
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:37,580
Yes, sir, that's right, sir.
How's it going? Sod all.

403
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:48,340
Is that the murder weapon? Clever, mind,
they worked it all out on a computer.

404
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:53,900
Took measurements from the stab wounds,
calculated the shape of the blade and stuff,

405
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:57,100
even those prongs -
I don't know how they do it.

406
00:39:57,101 --> 00:39:59,859
Nasty-looking beast, though.

407
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:05,740
D'you recognise it? No. We're trying to
trace it. Can't be that many of 'em.

408
00:40:05,741 --> 00:40:08,317
Sort of ornamental. We're checking the CDE

409
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,140
logs with customs in case
it's been imported.

410
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:13,300
Find the knife,
we might find the killer.

411
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:18,900
Anyway, if it rings any bells,
give's a shout. Yeah. Thanks.

412
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,539
..I said to Geoff,
it's not demotion being put in goal,

413
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,500
it's vital,
but was he having any of it?

414
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:42,179
He's off and moaning, says, who
books the ground, who pays the subs?

415
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,539
And all the time,
he's wheezing away,

416
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,819
and I'm like, Geoff,
you're proving my point mate...

417
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,811
"You never come down, you're
in charge of transport.

418
00:40:51,812 --> 00:40:55,419
" I said, "Mam, I can't
go hopping on a truck!"

419
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,899
All that Christmas stuff, all over again, I
was like, for God's sake, leave it...

420
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,700
Hello again. You were right.

421
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:28,379
You told Jack we should liaise with the
police. I was the only one who bothered.

422
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,859
So I was the only one
who saw the report.

423
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,860
They got a good likeness.
I'm arresting you for...

424
00:43:38,861 --> 00:43:41,260
How do I know you? I thought you saw it.

425
00:43:41,261 --> 00:43:44,859
And that can trip the amnesia,
one image, if you're clever.

426
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,500
He said you were good.

427
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:52,020
Anyway. It's not much good
now, I can't really...

428
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:57,139
But you're gonna put up a fight.
So I've got...

429
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,339
Um. Hold on. Sorry.

430
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,659
There. That's better.

431
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,300
Put it down. You had to come back.
Put down the gun.

432
00:44:09,301 --> 00:44:14,699
You're the only one who can make the link.
Well, the only one in public.

433
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,820
Torchwood's gonna find out
by morning, but I'll be gone.

434
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:22,940
I don't know where. Far away.

435
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:25,300
What am I gonna do?

436
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:29,540
I loved this job. I really loved it.

437
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:33,539
And now I've got to run.

438
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,499
Oh, Christ.

439
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,885
How can you do any other job
after this one? Please.

440
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,619
Put down the gun. Cos it gets inside you.

441
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,420
You do this job for long
enough, and you end up thinking,

442
00:44:46,421 --> 00:44:51,140
"How come we get all
the Weevils and bollocks and shit?"

443
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:54,100
Is that what alien life is? Filth?

444
00:44:54,101 --> 00:44:58,939
But maybe there's better stuff
out there, brilliant stuff,

445
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,060
beautiful stuff. Just...

446
00:45:01,061 --> 00:45:04,059
they don't come here.

447
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,419
This planet's so dirty,
that's all we get - the shit.

448
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,860
I don't know what you're talking
about. I wish I could forget.

449
00:45:14,861 --> 00:45:19,699
Why did you kill those people?
For the glove. Stay where you are.

450
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,859
I needed the bodies.
That's how it works. Violent death.

451
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,699
And it was so easy. To bring them back,

452
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,859
I'd position myself behind the head,
so they'd never see me twice.

453
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,300
You killed three people.
It was the only way.

454
00:45:31,301 --> 00:45:36,059
The more I use the glove, the more I
control it. I don't understand, what glove?

455
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,460
If I can get enough practice,
then think what that glove could do.

456
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:41,039
If I could get it work all the time,

457
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,979
on anything, beyond the two minutes,
if it could work permanently,

458
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,659
it could resurrect.

459
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,580
Resurrection on demand for
the whole world, isn't that good?

460
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:54,859
Isn't it though? Well, that's what I've
been working for, all day and all night.

461
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,700
The rest of them
go swanning about, but I'm working.

462
00:45:58,701 --> 00:46:03,379
You've got to get inside this stuff.
Surrender yourself to it.

463
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,418
I did, with the knife, and the glove,

464
00:46:05,419 --> 00:46:08,780
and that's why the perception
filter isn't gonna work on me.

465
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:14,980
Where did he come from?

466
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,139
What have you done?

467
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:23,059
Please don't. I can't let you go.

468
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,780
Please. I've got to.

469
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:27,220
I'm sorry.

470
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:29,860
Don't, don't, don't.

471
00:46:29,861 --> 00:46:31,979
I've got to, I've got to,
I've got to.

472
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:38,819
Put down the gun.

473
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:49,540
Susie, it's over. Now, come with me.

474
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:10,940
I remember. I remember.

475
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,140
I remember.

476
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:19,700
Owen and Toshiko, you didn't tell them that
you were shot in the head and survived.

477
00:48:19,701 --> 00:48:23,579
You didn't tell them either.
Followed my lead.

478
00:48:24,499 --> 00:48:28,980
Keep doing that, and you
might just get through this.

479
00:48:28,981 --> 00:48:31,619
But she killed you.

480
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:36,580
I can't die.

481
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:39,179
OK. But I can't.

482
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,539
Something happened to me a while
back. Long story. And far away.

483
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:48,660
But I was killed,

484
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:52,580
and then I was brought back
to life, and ever since then...

485
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:55,300
I can't die.

486
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:58,260
But how? I don't know.

487
00:48:58,261 --> 00:48:59,884
One day, I'll find a doctor,

488
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:04,059
the right sort of doctor and maybe
he can explain it. But until then...

489
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,659
Nothing kills you?

490
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,980
Kind of freaks people out, so...

491
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:12,059
Best if you don't say anything.

492
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,620
It doesn't matter anyway.

493
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:16,980
You'll only wipe my memory again.
Why would I do that?

494
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:21,380
Torchwood's got a vacancy.

495
00:49:21,381 --> 00:49:24,299
Job going spare. Do you want it?

496
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,460
But what d'you need me for?

497
00:49:27,461 --> 00:49:30,380
Cos maybe you were right.

498
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:32,740
We could do more to help.

499
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:40,539
What d'you think,
d'you want to join up? Yeah.

500
00:49:43,259 --> 00:49:44,820
I do. Yes.

501
00:50:29,646 --> 00:50:34,646
