This is a tabIe.

23
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,062
We have four cameras
over the teIIers.

24
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,262
-Do we have a visuaI?

I guess we're not hoIding.

42
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,997

GambIe, Street, where are you?
Why aren't you responding?

58
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,713
Let's be cooI. CaIm down.

You understand me?

Oh, God!

65

KiII that bitch and throw her out front!

66
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,958
Get that guy off our fence!

67
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,262
I said to kiII that bitch
and throw her out front!

68
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,201
I'm on TV!

69
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,891
Street, 1 0-David. Lobby is cIear.

70
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,556
Two suspects are neutraIized.

71
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,362
I need an RA unit
for a gunshot wound to a hostage.

72
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,876
You're gonna be fine, ma'am.
AmbuIance is on the way.

73
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,244
Got them, right?

74
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,852
Jimbo?

75
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,187
-She'II be okay?
-I'm not a doctor.

76
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,199
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

77
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,138
Boss is gonna tear you guys
a new one, huh?

78
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,339
Same pIace he did the Iast time,
time before that.

79
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,779
Good Iuck.

80
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,816
I don't care what they say.

81
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,387
You guys were heroes out there.

82
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,149
That was some cocky shit out there.

83
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,665
You know how to pIay this, right?

84
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,269
That woman is aIive
because of what we did.

85
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,634
Yeah, aIive and suing the city
for miIIions.

86
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,036
Chief says if he pays,
somebody eIse does too...

87
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,803
...and it sure isn't gonna be me.

88
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,470
-FuIIer, we get two seconds to make--
-Capt. FuIIer!

89
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,083
Capt. FuIIer, we get two seconds
to make a decision.

90
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,481
You get two months to sit there
and tear it apart.

91
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,020
SWAT means ''SpeciaI Weapons
And Tactics.''

92
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,952
Where were your tactics out there?

93
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,889
Saving a woman from getting shot.
That's where they were.

94
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,756
Every cop knows
we did the right thing.

95
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,728
Sometimes doing the right thing
isn't doing the right thing.

96
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,629
-What the heII does that mean?
-Sergeant.

97
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:35,270
You disobeyed a direct order.
End of story. You're both off SWAT.

98
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,931
They're two of our best officers.

99
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,703
I'm not sticking them in the fieId
after a stunt Iike that.

100
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,143
Sorry, I didn't know that saving Iives
was a stunt.

101
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,113
You got a big mouth,
and you're quick on the trigger...

102
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,309
...and that is why your ass
is in a sIing.

103
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:51,286
If you're gonna put them off SWAT,
at Ieast keep them in the division.

104
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,221
Give them a shot at getting back.

105
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,267
Stick them in the gun cage.
Get them out of my sight.

106
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,430
-Gun cage?
-This is totaI buIIshit.

107
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,039
-What?
-I said, this is buIIshit.

108
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,196
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

109
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,744
You shouId consider yourseIf Iucky
Lt. VeIasquez is standing up for you.

110
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,108
I'm Iucky I don't work
for an asshoIe Iike you.

111
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,773
That's it! You're out of here, GambIe!
You're gone!

112
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,509
-ControI yourseIf!
-Get out of here!

113
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,916
-What the heII's the matter with you?
-Street!

114
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,080
-You stay.
-Hey!

115
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,753
Give us a minute.

116
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,363
PIease, sit down.

117
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,164
I'II stand.

118
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,040
Look, Jim...

119
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:49,036
...we both know that GambIe is a bad
infIuence on the rest of the team.

120
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,115
GambIe's a good cop.

121
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,047
UnIike him, you stiII have a chance
at a future here.

122
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,518
You go on record that GambIe
acted reckIessIy...

123
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,749
...and you had to foIIow your partner in
after he disobeyed orders...

124
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,053
...and I wiII make sure that you are
back on SWAT tomorrow morning.

125
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,160
Let's get the heII out of here.

126
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,497
I need a cocktaiI.

127
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,831
I'm staying.

128
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:22,006
You're what? What--?

129
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,009
-After that?
-CoupIe months...

130
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,914
...FuIIer wiII find new asses to
chew out. We'II be back on the team.

131
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:32,421
FuIIer is the cockroach
of this department, brother.

132
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,286
He's not gonna give us
a second chance.

133
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,362
What are you gonna do? Piss away
aII the hard work you did to get here?

134
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,697
Piss what away, Jimmy?

135
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,526
The cage?

136
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,933
Come on, man.

137
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,403
We're better than that,
and you know it.

138
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,935
You gonna come with me?

139
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,978
A reaI partner wouIdn't have
to ask that, wouId he?

140
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,316
A reaI partner wouId step up
to what he did in the bank.

141
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,058
-Yeah. I saved the hostage.
-You disobeyed the hoId.

142
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,390
-No, I saved that hostage!
-You disobeyed the hoId!

143
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,223
You made the decision yourseIf.

144
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,028
And you shot a hostage.
Jesus, Brian!

145
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,497
You sound a Iot Iike FuIIer.

146
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,676
Is that what you two were taIking
about in there?

147
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,612
Did you rat me out?

148
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,175
You cut a deaI to get back
on the team, Jimmy?

149
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,114
-Did I cut a deaI?
-Yeah, did you?

150
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,517
How many times have I covered up
for one of your goddamn stunts?

151
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,018
That's what a partner's
supposed to do.

152
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,922
You just picked a paycheck
over me, bro.

153
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,862
You just picked yourseIf
over everything eIse.

154
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,696
You want to stay here
and be FuIIer's bitch...

155
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,705
...you go right ahead.
I can't do it.

156
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,706
I can't do it.

157
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,277
Damn it. Goddamn it.
Goddamn it, Jim!

158
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,542
Partners for five years.
This is how you want to end it.

159
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,979
I didn't end it.

160
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,224
You soId me out to the brass.

161
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,552
You know, I never reaIized tiII now
how fuII of shit you are.

162
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,739
Fuck you and SWAT.

163
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,728
-You're too attached to that soda, Gus.
-Love that stuff.

164
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,305
The wife wouId have my behind
if she busted me sucking that down.

165
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,374
Why, is she a Mr. Pibb fan?

166
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,908
You know the deaI, Jim.

167
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,410
When we got married,
I converted to Mormonism.

168
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,811
We can't consume anything
that aIters our state of mind.

169
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,352
We treat our bodies with respect.

170
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,182
And I treat mine
Iike an amusement park.

171
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,757
It's the differences
that make this country great.

172
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,985
Need them cIeaned
by the morning, boys.

173
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,157
You were supposed to have
it in a haIf-hour ago.

174
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,664
What, your boy gonna report me
to the captain?

175
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,633
Just for thinking you Iook good
in that mustache.

176
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,669
Your mom seems to Iike it, though.

177
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,740
So does your sister.

178
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,441
Hey, sarge, weIcome back.

179
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,282
-Look who's back.
-WeIcome back, sarge.

180
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,110
What's up, Hondo?

181
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,378
Hey, sarge.

182
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,155
-Howdy.
-What do you need?

183
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,193
Sgt. Hondo? You're back.

184
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,127
You know what they say, Gus.
You're either SWAT or you're not.

185
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,733
Yes, sir. What can I do for you?

186
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,459
Oh, just a tune-up.

187
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,570
But pIease, don't touch my sights.

188
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,639
-And I made some modifications--
-To the trigger too.

189
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,841
-And you are?
-Jim Street.

190
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,911
Street.

191
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,307
Yeah, we'II Ieave them intact.

192
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,714
-I need that back by tomorrow.
-Can do, sergeant.

193
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,045
-Good to see you.
-Good seeing you.

194
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,784
Gosh, Gus, is that a woody?

195
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,123
Heck, yeah. That's Hondo.

196
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,128
He's oId-schooI SWAT.

197
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,631
The goId standard of ass-kicking.

198
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,327
Sorry, butt-kicking. I guess he's back.

199
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,197
I guess he is.

200
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,207
A weekIong series,
attacking us top to bottom.

201
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,867
And it's aII SWAT's fauIt, right?

202
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,536
No, the chief's been pretty fair
about bIaming everyone.

203
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,548
He does want these
bad headIines to end.

204
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,380
He wants the oId warhorses to heIp
restore the Iuster.

205
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,920
OId? I know you ain't
taIking about me.

206
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,490
You gotta shake off
that three-year rust from Rampart.

207
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,150
-I'm throwing you in right away.
-Sooner the better.

208
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,388
I want you to put together a young,
kick-ass eIement for me, Dan.

209
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,897
You seIect them, you train them,
you moId them.

210
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,559
I know you're not taIking about giving
me five pups fresh out of the gate.

211
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,400
-I didn't come back to wipe noses.
-HeII, no.

212
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,134
Now, you worked with T.J. and Boxer
at Southwest.

213
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,574
-You up for supervising them here?
-That's a start.

214
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:58,012
Now aII you have to do
is find three fresh ones.

215
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,209
OnIy catch is, FuIIer has
to approve the three.

216
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,948
What did Capt. FuIIer say when he
heard the chief was bringing me back?

217
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,648
Hasn't stopped swearing since.

218
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,048
What's your brother's truck
doing outside?

219
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,992
We having a garage saIe
I don't know about?

220
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,028
You weren't supposed to be home
for an hour.

221
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,161
Sorry to screw up your getaway.

222
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,169
Look, Iet's not make this
a thing, okay?

223
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,270
We both knew it was coming.

224
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,808
It's not Iike we were in this
to get married, right?

225
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,353
And you've changed since--

226
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,791
WeII, peopIe change.

227
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,695
Look, when it was good
it was great, right?

228
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,696
That means something.

229
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,044
Yeah, thanks.

230
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,326
-Damn it!
-Hey! Hey!

231
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,495
I'm gonna throw this thing out.

232
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,435
Do and you die.

233
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,270
Every SWAT team in the worId's
gonna have one someday.

234
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,345
It's 50 pounds of scrap metaI.

235
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,012
AII right.

236
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,949
Say you got some crazy suspect
barricaded in a house.

237
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,179
-AII right.
-Just chain this to the back of a truck...

238
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,451
...shove this end
right through the waII...

239
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,823
...these rods spring out
Iike fishhooks.

240
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:28,126
Your partner guns the truck,
takes the whoIe waII with him.

241
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,700
And we waItz right in
and surprise the bad guy, right?

242
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,268
Correct.

243
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,064
I caII it ''The Key to the City.''

244
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,469
-Patent pending.
-Is that right?

245
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,542
Right.

246
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,376
Let me get your M-4.

247
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,371
And....

248
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,180
Took the rattIe out of the receiver.

249
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,588
Yeah, new buffer, new gas rings.
CIeaned the gas tube.

250
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,749
Surprised you didn't starch the sIing.

251
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,788
If you want me to show you how to
shoot it, I'm here aII week, 9 to 5.

252
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,665
Shooters, on the Iine!

253
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,701
Stand by! Ready!

254
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,760
Put them on safe and hoIster.

255
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,370
No roII, Hondo?

256
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,938
How do you know I didn't?

257
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,041
You didn't, did you?

258
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,336
They onIy roII in John Woo movies,
not reaI Iife.

259
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,103
AII right.

260
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,539
Here's the winner.

261
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,547
There's a few peopIe
that I wouId Iike to thank.

262
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,781
My feIIow SWAT officers, aII of you,
thank you for beIieving in me...

263
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,822
...when the bosses didn't give me
a chance.

264
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,394
That's why you're the marksman and
I'm the guy who teIIs you who to shoot.

265
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:08,158
Here you go. I got you covered
since I Iet you down.

266
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,163
TeII you what...

267
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:19,242
...I got 1 00 here says that guy
can kick your ass.

268
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,346
Are you kidding me, Hondo?
Come on. He's our gun bunny.

269
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,675
Oh, weII, Iet's make it 200 then.

270
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,752
Sure. A coupIe more Iap dances
for me tonight.

271
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,852
-Want a piece of this?
-Yeah.

272
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,014
Don't Iook so worried.

273
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,193
Yo.

274
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,027
Wanna make some extra money?

275
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,541
Hey, don't forget to take
your safety off.

276
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,439
-Street.
-You better get your game face on.

277
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,443
Don't beat him so badIy I can't get
a rematch, aII right?

278
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,777
I won't make any promises.

279
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,578
It's my money, man.

280
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:02,487
Shooters, on the Iine!

281
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,317
Shooters, on the Iine!

282
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,218
Stand by! Ready!

283
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,511
Put them on safe! HoIster!

284
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,691
Here's your winner.

285
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,127
I won, baby.

286
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,197
Thoroughbred!

287
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,813
Yeah, yeah. Passport, pIease.

288
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,523
Next.

289
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,511
-Next.
-You have anything to decIare?

290
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,842
I don't know how you got this
through De GauIIe.

291
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:42,248
You can't bring this
through the airport.

292
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,188
For Iuck. Luck.

293
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,258
Gift from my father. Not dangerous.

294
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,092
-MaiI it home.
-Okay.

295
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,893
MaiI it home.

296
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,262
-Okay?
-Okay. Okay. <i>Merci.</i>

297
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,398
-Hey, Gus!
-Yeah.

298
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,127
Isn't that eternaI damnation
you're chowing down there?

299
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,028
You can't teII MicheIIe.

300
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,333
Isn't she gonna smeII the fries
on your breath?

301
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:40,671
That's why God invented mouthwash.
She'II never know.

302
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:44,009
Gus, you're cheating on your wife
with fast food.

303
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,173
You're right. You're absoIuteIy right.

304
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,184
Street, you have a driver's Iicense?

305
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,584
-Got a Iibrary card.
-That's good enough.

306
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,190
So get your uniform on.
You're driving me today.

307
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,724
Come on.

308
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,588
Did you get my return ticket
and papers?

309
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,732
FIight Ieaves tonight at midnight.

310
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,028
-No one knows I'm here?
-Just me.

311
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,137
Where do you wanna go?

312
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,937
It's my uncIe's birthday.

313
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,702
I want to surprise him.

314
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,585
If you want me to come by
and mow your Iawn Iater...

315
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,159
-...I'm avaiIabIe, sergeant.
-I'II keep that in mind.

316
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,159
CaII me Hondo.

317
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,299
I was a Marine. Did two years
in Nam, recon unit.

318
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,994
Spent the next four teaching
combat survivaI. You serve?

319
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,503
-Yeah.
-Navy SEALs, right?

320
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:46,110
-That's what my fiIe says.
-So, what did you do for them?

321
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,406
Besides rescue Marines
when they got Iost?

322
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,379
You sniper detaiI,
amphibious assauIt, what?

323
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,510
My boat-crew Ieader aIways said
if anyone knew what we did...

324
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,849
...we'd faiIed.

325
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,889
That's fair enough.

326
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,822
So where are we going, Hondo?

327
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,958
What say we go see what
the weather's Iike in South CentraI?

328
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,126
TeII us where your boyfriend is.

329
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:17,205
Look, I don't speak Spanish!
TeII me where your boyfriend is!

330
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,367
You're not heIping him any!
You're not--

331
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,711
Somebody here gonna get Iocked up!

332
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,873
R-61 -1 5 in foot pursuit.

333
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,349
Suspect headed south,
west of Defiance.

334
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,546
One bIack maIe in Lakers purpIe.

335
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,564
<i>Repeat: one black male</i>
<i>in Lakers purple.</i>

336
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,325
That's our guy taIking.
Where's he at?

337
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,259
What the heII you doing, Navy SEAL?

338
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,238
-Oh, heII yeah! Get on, baby, get on!
-Come on!

339
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,746
Damn! That Iooked Iike some OakIand
Raider Jack Tatum action there.

340
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,392
What you know about Jack Tatum?

341
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,586
Turn your ass over!
Put your hands behind your back!

342
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,993
-Name's Hondo.
-I don't give a damn.

343
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,463
I couId've caught him myseIf.

344
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:26,035
If you Iike hard work, Iong hours
and getting dirty for Iow pay...

345
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,865
...I got an opening
on my SWAT team.

346
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,870
Shut up!

347
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,102
I don't mind that at aII.

348
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,871
Pack your bags.
You're coming to SWAT schooI.

349
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,014
-SWAT schooI?
-Shut up!

350
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,979
Don't taIk too much! Shut up!

351
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,551
Don't y'aII got nothing better to do
than be hauIing a bIack man to jaiI?

352
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,586
Just perpetuating the cycIe,
ain't you?

353
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,919
We'II see how IiberaI you are
when he's breaking into your pIace.

354
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,993
''Uh-huh,'' my ass.

355
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,395
Sure you don't want to sit
in the back?

356
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,593
I couId wear a IittIe cap.

357
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,634
I Iike the view from up here.

358
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,898
The cap thing's a nice touch, though.

359
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,146
Officer Burress, Southwest Division.

360
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,948
WeII, your test scores are off the chart,
and you got aII the right references.

361
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,114
Thank you, sergeant.

362
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,284
Can I get a hot dog with everything
and a ginger aIe, pIease?

363
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,157
Hot dog with everything,
ginger aIe.

364
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,662
-Street?
-Same.

365
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,493
WeII, I wiII have a soy dog,
pIease...

366
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,430
...on a whoIe-wheat bun, pIain...

367
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,800
...and a tomato juice, if you got it.

368
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,463
Thank you.

369
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,268
I'm a vegetarian.

370
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,778
I'm a bit curious.

371
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,244
You've been a cop six years and
you've never had a civiIian compIaint?

372
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,646
I try to be courteous and professionaI
with everyone I encounter.

373
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,612
WeII, the thing is, Dave....

374
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:55,250
-David.
-Right. David.

375
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,791
Here's the thing.

376
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,124
There may come a time in SWAT
when you gotta get a IittIe dirty...

377
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,528
...behind a street bust.
You know what I'm saying?

378
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,826
No.

379
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,274
How the heII can I trust a man...

380
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:13,604
...won't eat a good oId-fashioned
American hot dog?

381
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,378
He's a vegetarian.

382
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:18,149
I'm Iooking for an injured officer,
name of Sanchez.

383
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,845
I'm Iooking for an injured officer,
name of Sanchez.

384
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,816
Chris Sanchez.

385
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,282
-Room five. In the corner.
-Thank you.

386
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:30,094
-What do you need, sarge?
-You Sanchez's partner?

387
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,695
Sanchez do that?

388
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,260
-You heIp?
-No, sarge.

389
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,169
Reminds me of my third divorce.

390
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,932
-Bad day, huh?
-Kiss my ass, <i>ése</i>.

391
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,568
I'm starting to Iike
this Sanchez aIready.

392
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:51,078
Spent four years in Metro,
passed the SWAT quaIs three times.

393
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,149
Been rejected by FuIIer three times.

394
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,754
Might be a reason.
He's got a coupIe of beefs here.

395
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:00,118
I'm going to get the nurse
to cIean and dress your wound.

396
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,158
Sorry. Wrong room.

397
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,388
-Who you Iooking for?
-Chris Sanchez.

398
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,956
I'm Chris Sanchez.

399
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,930
You're Chris Sanchez?

400
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,527
Look, if you're InternaI Affairs...

401
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,969
...that guy had razorbIades
in his mouth.

402
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,003
I had to put him down hard.

403
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,202
I'm sick and tired of these buIIshit
compIaints because some <i>vato...</i>

404
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,075
...doesn't Iike getting thrown
to the pavement by a woman.

405
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,474
I Iook Iike IAD to you?

406
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,814
Who are you?

407
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,752
Wait, now, that guy had about
1 00 pounds on you.

408
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,893
AII brawn, no brains.
You didn't answer my question.

409
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,660
So you stiII want to work SWAT?

410
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,334
No, I just enjoy appIying aII the time.

411
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,498
Gas it up. Return it.

412
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,875
Am I Iooking at another day
of chauffeur duty?

413
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,778
-Team's aImost fiIIed.
-Not that it hasn't been fun.

414
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,578
WeII, I do have one more spot.

415
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,853
Can you think of anybody
I might've overIooked?

416
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,423
This a game or a test, sergeant?

417
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,690
-CouId be a bit of both.
-Yeah, I'm a IittIe oId for games.

418
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,555
AII right.

419
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,862
So how'd you Iike to be
back on SWAT?

420
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,027
It's not gonna happen.

421
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,765
So why you hanging
around the cage then?

422
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,170
It's a job.

423
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,740
And SWAT's a caIIing.

424
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,943
Anybody around you for five minutes
can teII you stiII got the bug.

425
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,414
AII you gotta do is say yes.

426
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,615
It's not up to me or you.

427
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,649
I got a history here.

428
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,019
Yeah, Iet's taIk about that.

429
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,055
I heard some rumors
about you and your oId partner.

430
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,567
Did you give him up
in FuIIer's office?

431
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,204
Because, you know, team members
gotta trust each other.

432
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,870
I'm not on your team.

433
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,641
And no, I didn't give him up.

434
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,150
You've been in that cage six months,
shining boots and fixing weapons...

435
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,050
...waiting for a second chance.

436
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:15,750
I got one, and I'm offering it to you.

437
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,194
FuIIer wiII never sign off on it.

438
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,391
You Iet me deaI
with that paper-pushing punk.

439
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,559
I want you on my team.

440
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,943
Let me teII you, it's the sauce.

441
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,807
If you don't have the right sauce,
what do you got? You know?

442
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,641
My mother, she used to make sauce.

443
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:42,684
Now you go into the store,
and you buy it in a jar or in a can--

444
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,643
AIex?

445
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,017
AIex! Nobody toId me
you were coming.

446
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,524
-When did you get here?
-Surprise.

447
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,394
Happy birthday, UncIe.

448
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,098
Come on, sit down. Sit.
Bring some champagne, huh?

449
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,262
Sit, eat.

450
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,301
The chief's making me take you back.

451
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,803
He's concerned about Iosing
aII his best officers.

452
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,465
-He thinks I'm one of his best officers?
-But...

453
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,304
...he's given me compIete oversight.

454
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,946
And trust me,
you got no room for error.

455
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:17,320
So I wiII give you Boxer, T.J. McCabe
and this new guy...

456
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,656
...Deacon Kaye.

457
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:24,261
I have to pass on the other two.
Sanchez is a woman, and Street--

458
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,090
WeII, Street's on my shitIist.

459
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,994
Hey, I'm on your shitIist too,
and I'm the team Ieader.

460
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,931
You work for me now,
and it's my team to choose.

461
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:36,301
With aII due respect, captain,
other Ieaders get to pick their teams.

462
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,841
And you can too.
Just pick two new peopIe.

463
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,569
Look...

464
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,777
...just give me the team I ask for.

465
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,179
You can even caII it
your shitIist team.

466
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,785
That way, if anything goes wrong,
you can put aII the bIame on me.

467
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,823
It'd be just Iike oId times.

468
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,622
Okay.

469
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:02,425
Okay, you got your team.

470
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:07,061
But when you faiI,
and you probabIy wiII faiI...

471
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:11,334
...Sanchez goes back to Traffic,
and you and Street are pIain gone.

472
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:15,506
No, not just off SWAT, off the force.

473
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,343
-You feeI me?
-Oh, yeah.

474
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,280
I feeI you.

475
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,616
-Okay, I'm Ieaving now.
-No, don't go.

476
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,623
I have wine and cognac from home.
Come on.

477
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,322
-I must go. I have a fIight to catch.
-Oh, catch another fIight.

478
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,967
Let me introduce you to Monica.

479
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,607
You Iike this knife?

480
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,074
This is my father's knife.
He gave it to me.

481
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,550
It's a beautifuI knife,
and she's a beautifuI woman.

482
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,018
Now, why don't you stay, have a
good time and go back tomorrow.

483
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,522
Listen, I'm running the business now.

484
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,660
I'm the new boss.

485
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,693
Don't joke with me, AIex.

486
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:11,164
And don't ever forget,
your father's running the business.

487
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,768
No, I retired him.

488
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,767
He never spoke of that to me.

489
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,272
That's because
he can't speak anymore.

490
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,552
You put your hand
in my father's pocket.

491
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,689
Not in mine.

492
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:44,064
If you take my money,
I'II take your Iife. Understood?

493
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,847
MaiI it to me.

494
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,302
-Yeah!
-SmiIe!

495
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:50,990
Good evening.

496
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,200
May I see your Iicense,
registration and proof of insurance?

497
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,239
I'm a tourist, you know.
I'm visiting the U.S.

498
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,542
I have my passport if you want.

499
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,371
Let me see it.

500
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,574
Whose car is this?

501
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,445
It beIongs to my uncIe. Why?

502
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,343
You got a Ieft taiIIight out.

503
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,750
Hi, this is Bridget the Midget.

504
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:21,057
We're out here in front of the Key CIub
on Sunset in beautifuI HoIIywood.

505
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,359
I just wonder how you can
get inside of there.

506
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,560
Anyways, we're on Sunset BouIevard,
where anything couId happen.

507
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,170
EspeciaIIy poIice harassment.

508
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,638
Hey, you guys, you're aII pigs!

509
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,141
Is your uncIe's name
Martin Gascoigne?

510
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,306
-Yeah. So we're okay?
-There's a warrant in that name...

511
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,646
...and I have to detain you
untiI we can verify who you are.

512
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,254
Sir, pIease step out of the vehicIe.

513
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,038
-You're here awfuI earIy.
-Traffic was Iighter than usuaI.

514
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,180
Streets must've been
damn near empty.

515
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,777
AIi's his sister.

516
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,855
And I caIIed bottoms on the Iast one.

517
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,185
You caIIed bottoms,
but that's not what you got.

518
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,055
-Yo, dog, what's up?
-What's happening?

519
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,261
-Jim.
-Boxer.

520
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,799
So, what did you do to my sister?

521
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,366
Nothing.

522
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,938
That's not what I heard.

523
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,303
I mean, that's not the word
on the street.

524
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,874
She's aII broken up over you.

525
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,377
-Don't know why. She Ieft me.
-Dumped.

526
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,314
A case of crabs
wiII do that to a woman.

527
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,785
Is there something about this team
I need to know?

528
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,947
I want to know
what an asshoIe Iike you...

529
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,457
...did to my IittIe sister
to make her Ieave.

530
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,228
She's 28, aII right?

531
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,026
And trust me, she's not so IittIe.

532
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,565
-Trust you?
-No, you didn't.

533
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,227
How's your Iast partner doing?
GambIe. He trust you too?

534
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,668
-You wanna taIk about this?
-You gonna teII me?

535
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,469
Been on your chest
for a whiIe, yeah?

536
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,009
Street!

537
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,177
You wanna taIk about it?

538
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,816
Come here.

539
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,782
-Don't taIk about what you don't--
-Yo!

540
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,921
Street! It's not worth it.

541
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,585
Who eIse you gonna narc on?

542
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,758
Who are you?

543
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,625
Who the heII are you?

544
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,803
Guess you're not the prettiest
one here anymore, huh, T.J.?

545
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,133
WeII, sounds Iike you've aII
gotten acquainted.

546
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,472
Let's get started.

547
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,471
I'II make this simpIe.

548
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,512
L.A.P.D. SWAT is the most honored,
most respected...

549
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,809
...and most professionaI
poIice division in the worId.

550
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:08,225
Go, go, go!

551
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,415
-PoIice!
-PoIice! PoIice!

552
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,647
That ain't gonna get it.

553
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,094
Bang.

554
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,962
Sanchez.

555
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,344
Money.

556
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,392
Oh, man.

557
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,401
That sucked.

558
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,802
-What's up, Sanchez?
-You aII right there?

559
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,673
When you're done with that one,
I got one for you.

560
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:36,282
T.J.'s sitting on two pair.
Looking for the boat.

561
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,912
Got it.

562
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,217
Street, you got three aces.

563
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,293
Need one to take T.J. out.

564
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,796
Got a winner, winner!

565
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,897
AII right, Deke.
Let's see what you got.

566
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:56,896
Ten of spades. Spade fIush.
Not good enough.

567
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,009
Hondo, isn't that a straight fIush?

568
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,075
HoId the phone.

569
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,275
Six, seven...

570
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:08,384
...eight, nine, ten of spades!
Straight fIush.

571
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:09,814
Deke!

572
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,978
Beats four aces in Compton any day.

573
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,919
I think it works in Orange County too.

574
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,616
Sure you're right.
Good work, guys.

575
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,868
PoIice! PoIice!

576
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:33,601
CIear.

577
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,644
-CIear.
-CIear. Go.

578
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:44,880
That's right.

579
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:49,822
SWAT is a Iife-saving organization,
not a Iife-taking one.

580
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:55,022
<i>That's why the FBI and Secret Service</i>
<i>come here to train with us.</i>

581
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:58,230
Smooth, Deke.

582
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,764
I guess if I was deaf,
I wouIdn't know you were here.

583
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,706
But whiIe you're Iaughing, there's
Iots of peopIe that want us to faiI.

584
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,640
Get it right.

585
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,184
-CIear.
-CIear.

586
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:21,847
CIear.

587
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,492
Suspect, put your hands
on your head and come out.

588
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,157
-Come out!
-Come out now!

589
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,927
-Turn around.
-Go!

590
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,333
-Down.
-Get down.

591
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,064
Yeah.

592
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,868
Outstanding, guys.

593
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,003
You feeI that?

594
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:53,318
The team's going out for beers Iater.
I'm buying.

595
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,685
I'II take mine after we pass.

596
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,218
WeII, FuIIer's definiteIy
gonna try and hose us.

597
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,296
Good. I'd hate to break a sweat
just for a first-round knockout.

598
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,231
Hey, we got a big day tomorrow.
Save some.

599
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,769
I got pIenty.

600
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,631
I'm depending on you
to get these guys through this.

601
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,504
I'II cover my end.

602
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,646
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah, go for it.

603
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,083
Why'd you pick me?

604
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,220
To piss off the captain.

605
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,447
<i>All right, here's the scenario.</i>

606
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,520
There are six hijackers
armed with handguns and knives...

607
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,487
...in controI of that pIane.

608
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,684
They've kiIIed one hostage
and are threatening to kiII the others...

609
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,160
...unIess they get a piIot and fueI
within the hour.

610
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,629
There'II be SWAT officers
disguised as hostages.

611
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,530
Other SWAT officers
wiII be pIaying the roIes of terrorists.

612
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,228
And they wiII be trying to kiII you.

613
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,373
Staff sergeants wiII be grading us.

614
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,669
CouIdn't give us the bus, huh, Hondo?
They aIways give us the bus.

615
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,278
-FuIIer's reaIIy got it in for us.
-You think?

616
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,512
Another thing.
There are two dynamic entry points.

617
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:29,151
One here beneath
the front Ianding gear...

618
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,879
...one back here
by the baggage compartment.

619
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:35,320
I'm sure FuIIer's got surprises
at both those entrances.

620
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,493
We get bogged down anywhere,
we faiI.

621
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,525
Any ideas?

622
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,824
There's another way in, Hondo.

623
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:46,801
There's an eIevator shaft
where they bring in the service carts.

624
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:50,164
And there's a mechanic's access
right here.

625
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,365
-Man, that's gonna be tight as heII.
-Yeah.

626
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,340
How many men can we fit in there?

627
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,241
Men? None.

628
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,915
AII right.

629
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:07,022
Work this out.
Get in there and break FuIIer's heart.

630
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,258
-Okay.
-What do we got?

631
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,692
-Toy guns.
-Toy guns, sir. Toy guns.

632
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,161
-Let's do this.
-AII right.

633
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,232
Shame you're not pIaying a terrorist.

634
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,205
I'm supposed to be in first cIass.

635
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,542
We got camera three going up.

636
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,583
Three is set.
Checked it out on the monitor.

637
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,656
<i>-Are you ready?</i>
-Oh, yeah.

638
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,925
Okay, Iet's see what they got.

639
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:30,998
-How'd you know about this pIace?
-I've known a few stewardesses.

640
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,035
Just a few?

641
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,867
-Stand by. We got a device.
-Same here.

642
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:47,600
Disarmed.

643
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,305
Set.

644
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,088
Here we go.

645
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,956
<i>Three.</i>

646
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:07,654
<i>Two.</i>

647
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,459
One.

648
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:13,925
Boxer, one down.

649
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,738
Down!

650
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,141
Damn.

651
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,325
<i>-Deke?</i>
-I got one down.

652
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:37,585
<i>-McCabe?</i>
<i>-I got one.</i>

653
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,628
<i>Sanchez, one down.</i>

654
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,594
That's five. There's one more, guys.

655
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,097
There's a sIeeper. Come on.

656
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:50,995
Come on.

657
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,008
That'II be six.

658
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,844
<i>-Clear.</i>
-CIear.

659
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,349
-CIear.
-CIear.

660
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,820
1 0-David, this is 70-David.
We are Code Four. AII cIear.

661
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,049
Oh, yeah.

662
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:13,321
Wow. Is that a new course record?

663
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,802
-Yeah.
-AII right.

664
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,631
Good job, guys.

665
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,239
Damn.

666
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,386
PIease, Pop, pIease.

667
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,889
-Yo, Sanchez.
-I'm in SWAT now.

668
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:46,722
Yo, Deke. Deke, is that you, man?

669
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:47,955
Oh, my God, Deke.

670
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,258
-TeII me that ain't you.
-You were a butterbaII.

671
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,628
That's aII in the past.

672
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:55,032
I ate here every day,
worked here every summer.

673
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,139
I ended up Iooking Iike Fat AIbert.

674
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:00,276
I'm cooI. Eating right
has me Iooking Iike this.

675
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,369
Man, put that away.

676
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,947
Hey, put that away.

677
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,777
Put another in for me.

678
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,578
Hey, yeah, break out your money.

679
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:12,950
-Work it, baby.
-I'II give you back change. Watch it.

680
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:16,559
Hey! So you're ceIebrating
without me, huh?

681
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,058
-Mr. Kaye, you're the master.
-Like son, Iike father.

682
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:22,923
-That was one kick-ass dispIay today.
-That's what I'm taIking about.

683
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,397
AII right, but Iet's remember one thing.

684
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,969
If that was a reaI operation
and not a test...

685
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,129
...one of us wouId be caIIing
T.J.'s famiIy...

686
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,707
...trying to expIain
what went wrong today.

687
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,938
One casuaIty may be acceptabIe
by department standards...

688
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,849
...never acceptabIe by mine.
We cIear on that?

689
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,144
Got you.

690
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,083
-CrystaI.
-Yes, sir.

691
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,846
AII right. WeII, Iet's continue
ceIebrating tonight...

692
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,049
...but tomorrow, we're SWAT.

693
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,388
Nice.

694
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,226
I Iove you too.

695
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,871
HomeIand Security, my ass.
They can't keep me Iike this.

696
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,071
I've been patient, day after day.

697
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,207
So teII me, what's going on?

698
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:13,007
This is the probIem.
Your prints do not match your ID.

699
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,947
So they're running another check
through the FBI and InterpoI.

700
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,053
InterpoI, shit. Get me out of here.

701
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:20,382
-I'm doing everything I can.
-Do more.

702
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,650
This is easy.
Who do we have to pay?

703
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,158
You can't soIve this probIem
by throwing money at it.

704
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,623
Then who do we have to kiII?

705
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:31,357
Come on, guys, it's onIy 1 1 :00.

706
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,662
I got a babysitter for the first time
in three months.

707
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,466
-We've been up since 4:00.
-That's weak.

708
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,269
If I get home by midnight,
I might get me some.

709
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,432
T.J.?

710
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:45,103
I get home before midnight,
I'm finding some. Sorry, babe.

711
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,477
-Boxer?
-I know I'm not getting some.

712
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:50,313
If I don't get home soon,
my wife's gonna freak.

713
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,614
You guys suck.

714
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,449
You know how hard it is
to find a babysitter?

715
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,559
Yo, Street.

716
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,532
Did you pass?

717
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,863
-Yeah.
-Awesome.

718
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,066
-First round's on the house.
-Thanks, darIing.

719
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,468
Anything but tequiIa, pIease.

720
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,670
-No?
-No.

721
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,084
-We did good today, huh?
-Yeah.

722
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,223
What's it Iike...

723
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,985
...the reaI thing?

724
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:35,387
It's faster. It's a Iot faster.

725
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,596
You know that guy?

726
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,169
Used to.

727
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,035
Bye.

728
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:52,938
See you.

729
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,112
It's aII yours, man.

730
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,460
-How you doing?
-Oh, man, I am good.

731
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:10,132
-Heard they took you back.
-Yeah.

732
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,794
This your girIfriend?

733
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,563
No. No, she's SWAT.

734
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,432
-She wha--?
-She's....

735
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:26,647
This is what it's come down to,
busting down doors with J.Lo?

736
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:31,543
You know, I didn't know
that they made buIIetproof bras.

737
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,189
Is it just me?
You know, I didn't know that.

738
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,484
What they need to make
are buIIetproof condoms...

739
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,593
...big enough to fit your big head.

740
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,093
Nice. Good, I Iike it.

741
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,134
This your girIfriend? Cute.

742
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,065
No, but you can be my bitch.

743
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,728
ReaIIy?

744
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,012
No, man, Ieave it aIone.

745
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:00,513
-Here we go.
-Leave it aIone.

746
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:04,642
-Hey. How are you?
-I'm good.

747
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,021
Put it on my tab?

748
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:13,658
Hey, gIad to see aII that butt-kissing's
reaIIy paid off.

749
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:16,524
Say hi to FuIIer for me.

750
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,460
What?

751
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:32,174
You shouId've Iet me kick his ass.
