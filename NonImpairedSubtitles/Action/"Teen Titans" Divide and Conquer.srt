Teen Titans [01x01] - Divide And Conquer EN v1.0

00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,073
Subtitles by Mr.Henky

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:18,770
Code red! Cell block Nine! Move out!

4
00:00:24,016 --> 00:00:25,532
Main yard secure.

5
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:28,228
There he is!

6
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:32,546
He’ll free the criminals!

7
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:34,932
Fire!

8
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:56,453
You know, Cinderblock, normally the bad guys break out of jail.

9
00:00:56,863 --> 00:01:00,172
And I can think of five good reasons why you don’t want to break in.

10
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,674
One!

11
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,045
Two!

12
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:07,390
Three!

13
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:09,732
Four!

14
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:12,346
Five!

15
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:22,939
No matter how you do the math, it all adds up to you going down. So, are you going to go quietly…

16
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:24,703
…or is this gonna get loud?

17
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:30,909
Titans! Go!

18
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:32,243
I am sorry to disappoint you, but I am stronger than I look.

19
00:03:48,617 --> 00:03:50,514
Azarath Metrion—

20
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:01,522
Heh…watch out for falling dinosaurs?

21
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:04,266
I’m gonna leave you alone now.

22
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:16,301
Thrashing only makes me hold tighter!

23
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:20,645
Now there’s an idea.

24
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:01,775
Want to give this guy the Sonic Boom?

25
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:06,319
I got the Sonic if you got the Boom.

26
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:10,604
Yo, Rockhead!

27
00:05:37,276 --> 00:05:41,151
Hey, hey, look at this. It’s freedom!…Let’s do it!…Let’s get outta here!…Yeah!

28
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:28,420
Let’s go, let’s go!

29
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,274
I think we’re gonna make it!

30
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:30,013
Yeah!

31
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:33,470
Huh?

32
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:37,843
Think again.

33
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:49,012
Jailbreak? I don’t see any jailbreak.

34
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:51,938
None of us would have seen one if Cyborg hadn’t messed up!

35
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:54,366
Me? I messed up nothing!

36
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,619
<i>You</i> got in my way!

37
00:06:57,175 --> 00:07:00,597
<i>You</i> were too far forward, and Cinderblock got away because of it!

38
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,459
You saying this is <i>my</i> fault?

39
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,127
Want me to say it again?

40
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:07,770
Stop! No more mean talking!

41
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:13,676
Yeah. If you two are gonna fight, we need time to sell tickets.

42
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,803
Cinderblock escaped. No amount of yelling will change that. So stop acting like idiots, and let’s go home.

43
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:23,331
Hmph!

44
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:28,227
Loser.

45
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:29,830
Jerk.

46
00:07:30,926 --> 00:07:31,798
What did you say?!?

47
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:33,740
Do you have a problem, Tin Man?

48
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:37,197
Yeah! It’s four feet tall and smells like cheap hair gel!

49
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:42,333
Well, you’re an oversized klutz and your feet smell like motor oil!

50
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,987
You’re bossy, you’re rude, you got no taste in music!

51
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,744
I don’t even know why you’re on this team!

52
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,427
That makes two of us! I QUIT!!

53
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:39,694
Cinderblock. I see your mission was a success. Good. We will proceed with Phase Two. Wake him.

54
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:55,583
I’m…awake? I should never be awake! I’m only human when I’m sleeping!

55
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:59,769
But for what I have in mind, your human form is useless.

56
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:02,153
I need Plasmus.

57
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:28,754
This is Cyborg. I’m either in the gym, playing GameStation-

58
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:31,456
-or kicking bad-guy butt. Leave a message.

59
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:35,333
Hello? Cy? Pick up!

60
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:37,954
Come on, Cy, pick up!

61
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,268
I know you’re there. The phone’s built in your arm!

62
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:48,955
Taste.

63
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:01,765
What <i>is</i> that? Cream of toenails?

64
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,185
Pudding of Sadness.

65
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:06,735
It is what the people of my planet eat when bad things happen.

66
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:18,744
Try. The displeasing taste will ease your troubled mind.

67
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:25,590
My mind is never troubled. People come, people go. It’s pointless to be upset about Cyborg.

68
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,493
What?

69
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:40,200
Here, Robin. You must need this most of all since…well…

70
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:44,373
I’m fine.

71
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:48,349
Who knows? Maybe we’re better off without him.

72
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,862
Yo! Whose turn to do dishes?

73
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:14,411
Cyborg.

74
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:30,440
Come on, come on…I’m not scared to take…no! Yeah! Got it! Just one more and…yes!

75
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,119
New high score!

76
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:03,114
I’m sorry.

77
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:12,770
Cinderblock strikes again?

78
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:13,980
You wish.

79
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:49,228
That stuff can’t be good for you.

80
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:56,422
Nice one!

81
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:04,900
Star! Let him have it!

82
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:09,432
Did I let him have too much?

83
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:14,877
I’m thinking not enough.

84
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:20,605
Maybe he just needs to chill.

85
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:50,766
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

86
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:11,111
Come on! Let me go, you giant zit!

87
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:23,232
Robin!

88
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:26,724
I’m okay…sort of. 

89
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:33,024
And I thought Star’s pudding tasted bad!

90
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:44,741
Disappointing.

91
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:49,700
With one Titan missing, this is almost too easy.

92
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:52,234
I was expecting more of a challenge. Cinderblock.

93
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:55,980
Begin Phase Three.

94
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:05,531
I feel like the underside of a Zornian muck beetle.

95
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,155
Tell me about it.

96
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:09,295
Dude, I am not on the menu!

97
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:13,949
Maybe the best way to take you down…

98
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:17,722
…is to tie you up!

99
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:29,983
We did it!

100
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:31,478
Nice work, team.

101
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:33,922
Yeah. Didn’t think we’d pull it off without-

102
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:40,643
We finished just in time. Cinderblock’s been spotted downtown. Come on!

103
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:44,057
Huh?

104
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:01,332
Uh…heads up.

105
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,100
Four against five. Not good odds.

106
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,504
Forget the odds. We need a plan.

107
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:30,027
Titans! Separate!

108
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:47,032
I still got the Sonic if you still got the Boom.

109
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,724
Teen Titans! Go!

110
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:29,554
Look, uh…sorry about…

111
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:30,912
Yeah.

112
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:33,600
So…are we cool?

113
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:37,258
Frosty.

114
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:44,539
You made up! Glorious! I wish to initiate a group hug.

115
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,262
Pass.

116
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:52,026
Yeah, yeah, yeah, warm fuzzies all around. But we still gotta stop Cinderblock.

117
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:53,185
No, we don’t.

118
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:56,700
Thought I’d bring a present, ’case you were still mad.

119
00:20:03,264 --> 00:20:06,198
Thanks. But there is one thing that’s still bothering me.

120
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:15,081
Breaking into jail? Using Plasmus to distract us? The whole plan seems to be a little too smart for Cinderblock.

121
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,688
I’ve been thinking the same thing.

122
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:23,264
Someone must have been pulling the strings. But who?

123
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:25,763
Well, whoever they are-

124
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:27,878
-they’re no match for the Teen Titans.

125
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,495
I heard that!

126
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:46,466
Next time my plans <i>will</i> succeed. And the Titans will pay.
