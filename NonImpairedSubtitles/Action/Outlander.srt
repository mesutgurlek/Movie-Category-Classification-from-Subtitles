1
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,731
F

2
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,441
Weapon.

3
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,087
It's time, Freya.

4
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,923
I told you before, Father

5
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,157
the answer is no!

6
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,961
Wulfric will be a good man!

7
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,832
With you by his side
maybe a good king!

8
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,737
He'll bejust like his father
a tyrant and a butcher.

9
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,433
I won't marry him!

10
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,683
Then you better choose someone else.

11
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,983
Because when he's king
it'll be too late to say no.

12
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,524
Then don't make him king!

13
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,763
Let me look at that.

14
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:36,560
It's fine.

15
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,192
Let me see it!

16
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,913
I'm not getting any younger, Freya.

17
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,852
Ljust want to make sure that
you're well looked after

18
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,620
when I'm gone.

19
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,219
I know, Father. I know.

20
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,621
And

21
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,824
if any one can make
Wulfric keep the peace,

22
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,631
by the gods, it's you.

23
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:20,305
I rule Herot and Freya rules me.

24
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,038
I don't think so.

25
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,881
And no queen ofmine
will fight like a man.

26
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,791
I will take care of you.

27
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,294
She's like her mother.

28
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,665
You'd do well to tread
more softly with her.

29
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,437
There's nothing soft about her.

30
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,844
Gunnar's village was sacked.

31
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,676
What happened?

32
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,106
I don't know.

33
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,048
There were no bodies, nothing.

34
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,519
Slavers?

35
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,488
Too much blood.

36
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,093
What about Gunnar?

37
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,296
He's still trading with the Rus.

38
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,227
He'll be back before the snow.

39
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,429
He'll think it was us.

40
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,427
It should've been.

41
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,037
Was it?

42
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,405
No.

43
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,810
We caught a man
nearby in the woods.

44
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,380
One of ours?

45
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,813
Well, what tribe was he? Frankish, Rus?

46
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,891
I don't know. But I'll find out.

47
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,683
Well, do it quickly.

48
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,924
It's war if you don't.

49
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,404
I'll take those.

50
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:16,920
Bring him

51
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,558
So who are you, Outlander?

52
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,298
I'd answer him, friend.

53
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:28,637
Your name!

54
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:34,610
My name is Kainan.

55
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,477
Kainan? What kind ofname is that?

56
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,106
Where are you from?

57
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,412
An Island to the north.

58
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,147
Why did you attack Gunnar's village?

59
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,450
I didn't attack anyone.

60
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,683
Then why were you there?

61
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,724
I was hunting.

62
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,656
Hunting?

63
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:49,818
Hunting what?

64
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,259
That.

65
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,228
A dragon

66
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,034
Tell me! Why where you there?

67
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,439
Where are your men?

68
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,511
Told you.

69
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,115
Don't lie to me.

70
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,418
Stick with the dragons. I like that one.

71
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,517
All right.

72
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,124
I'll tell you.

73
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:27,223
I was hunting... dragons.

74
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,439
Not yet

75
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,051
The prisoner's hurt.

76
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,687
So are you, by the looks ofit.

77
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,054
And he needs looking after

78
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,962
I've got work to do.
You clean up your own mess.

79
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,538
To hell with it then.

80
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,735
He dies, it's on your head.

81
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,034
Bjorn!

82
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,140
He needs looking after

83
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,849
Let me pass.

84
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,985
That's enough! Get out!

85
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,492
What did he tell you?

86
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,066
Nothing.

87
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,270
Some lies about a dragon.

88
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,041
But he's hiding something.

89
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,245
Keep at him.

90
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,945
I have to send riders to find Gunnar.

91
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,450
He has to know that it wasn't us.

92
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,146
He'll never believe us.
Not when he sees his village.

93
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,983
We should kill him while
we still have the chance.

94
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,157
Like your father would have done.

95
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,521
And he would have been right.

96
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,788
My father's dead because of Gunnar.

97
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,524
Your father's dead
because he was a fool!

98
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,837
You want to kill Gunnar.

99
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,976
I can understand that.

100
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,512
And you want to rule from here.

101
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,620
I can understand that, too.

102
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:48,589
But it's not your sword that
will make you king, nor Shield Hall.

103
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,725
It's how you rule your own
head and heart.

104
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,230
Until you understand that
then you'll never wear this.

105
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,993
Water.

106
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,297
Please.

107
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,483
Thank you.

108
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,762
Did you do what they're saying?

109
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,331
Did you attack Gunnar's village?

110
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,663
No.

111
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:19,982
Bjorn!

112
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,051
It's sharp.

113
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,951
It's never sharp enough.

114
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:04,953
If Gunnar comes tonight...

115
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,294
If Gunnar comes tonight he'll stick
that blade right up your arse.

116
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,302
...then you'll wish it wasn't so sharp.

117
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:32,917
You smell that?

118
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,831
Arn?

119
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,105
The sentries are gone!

120
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,806
It's Gunnar! Get to the walls!

121
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,492
Where are they?!

122
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,395
Is it raiders?

123
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,195
Give me my blade, woman!

124
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,609
They're inside the walls.

125
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,145
Take your men, fan out!

126
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,838
The rest with me!

127
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,717
Gunnar!

128
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,531
Moorwen!

129
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:34,929
He's getting away!

130
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,294
Get him out ofhere!

131
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,603
Where is Gunnar?

132
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:39,965
I don't know!

133
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,880
What could have done this?

134
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,874
Right, get up.
It was the demon, Mimir.

135
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,949
Come to drag us down to Jotunheim

136
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,847
and freeze us dead.

137
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,750
Enough of your forest spirits, Unferth.

138
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,852
It was Frankish raiders. Sure enough!

139
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:17,458
They climbed over the walls.

140
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,926
Then what, Boromir?

141
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,031
We all saw Bjorn's body.

142
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,564
He was clawed to death.

143
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,463
It was an animal.
No!

144
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,330
This is the work ofLucifer!

145
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,031
Visited upon us because you
buried King Halga like a pagan...

146
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,232
and not like a Christian!

147
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,433
My father was a Viking.

148
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,841
He worshiped Odin not some
woodworker nailed to a cross.

149
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,514
And I'll be damned ifit was
anything but a bear!

150
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,651
First Gunnar, now us.

151
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,225
Three ofmy men are missing
five are dead.

152
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,367
May Odin keep them.

153
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:10,711
So why don't you tell me
about your dragon?

154
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,049
My people call it a Moorwen.

155
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,384
A Moorwen?

156
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,522
I've never even heard of such a thing.

157
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,020
Believe me.

158
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,389
The first time I saw one,

159
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,520
I didn't know what I was looking at.

160
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,991
It wasjust a smudge of
light in the darkness.

161
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,562
It could have been anything.

162
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,242
That's how it draws
its prey in, with light.

163
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,409
Foxfire.

164
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:45,673
It kills men, beasts, everything.

165
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,914
And it smells like death.

166
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,614
There's nothing like that here.

167
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,484
Yes, there is.

168
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,320
Because I brought it here.

169
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,424
Silence!

170
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,096
Leave him!

171
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,729
Come here!

172
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,104
You say you're responsible for this.

173
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,542
Yes.

174
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,971
It got on my ship, it killed my crew.

175
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,708
Then we crashed here.

176
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,119
I know you don't believe me...

177
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,620
but this thing has carved out
a territory and you are in it.

178
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:36,458
You think you can frighten us
with children's stories.

179
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,432
This is no story.

180
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,071
But whatever you think did this,

181
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,532
you're going to hunt it down
aren't you?

182
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,313
Take me with you.

183
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,247
How am I supposed to
fight it like this?

184
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,752
You're not.

185
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,888
That one's yours.

186
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,086
What do I do with it?

187
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,593
Hey! What do I with it?

188
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,094
Outlander.

189
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,343
Enough! Mount up.

190
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,514
How's yourjaw?

191
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,813
Yourjaw!

192
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,382
Freya?

193
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,817
Here. Try some ofthis.

194
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:13,663
Cure anything from a sword
in the guts to a broken heart.

195
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,190
You shouldn't feel too bad.

196
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,130
You see that?

197
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,738
She once stuck me with a fork.

198
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,340
It seems I got a little too
familiar when I was in me cups.

199
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,808
Well, go on! Drink!

200
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,249
Good, eh?

201
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:40,982
What is it?

202
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,353
What is it!

203
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,393
What kind of backwater are you from?

204
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,019
Some place far from here.

205
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,062
For certain.

206
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:51,191
Far off and sad that's
not tasted Herot mead.

207
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,935
Boromir likes his drink.

208
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,107
You know, Outlander...

209
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,211
we trade in every direction
for a thousand miles.

210
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:11,684
South, east and west, not north.

211
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,558
There's nothing there.

212
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,283
Maybe you haven't
looked far enough.

213
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,019
Perhaps.

214
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:23,059
But what's a man who lives so far
north doing in these seas?

215
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,397
We have an outpost near here.

216
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:29,699
And that's where this Moorwen
got on board your ship?

217
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,837
Yes.

218
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,746
And what it did to your village
it did to mine.

219
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,514
We were taking the bodies
back for a burial.

220
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,147
That's when it must
have gotten onboard.

221
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,286
Hold up!

222
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,100
Bear came this way.

223
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,912
There's been a lot of
animals through here since.

224
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,738
We should split up
try to find the main trail.

225
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,441
That's a bad idea.

226
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,242
We should stay together.

227
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,719
We'll pair up.

228
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,292
Wulfric, you take the Outlander.

229
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,646
A bear wouldn't do this.

230
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,507
It's here.

231
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,020
Wulfric! Wait!

232
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,543
Now that's a bear.

233
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,157
Outlander!

234
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,132
Take this sword.

235
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,400
And your life, too.

236
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,107
It's yours again.

237
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:51,327
Wulfric! Wulfric!

238
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,308
Kainan!

239
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:49,909
Kainan! Kainan!

240
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,569
Sit here!

241
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,796
Be my guest tonight.

242
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:12,135
Daughter! Kainan needs some drink.

243
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:18,046
See, now you look like a Viking.

244
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,615
Doesn't he, Freya?

245
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,086
Perhaps.

246
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,250
Nobody cooks this better
than my kitchen.

247
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,563
Eat!

248
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:39,061
There I was, running into
the cave ahead of everyone...

249
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,569
when suddenly, out ofnowhere
came the biggest...

250
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:47,234
most vicious bear I've ever seen.

251
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,744
He tore up two grown men...

252
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,405
and was about to eat
the king himself...

253
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,348
when the Outlander stuck
his sword in it.

254
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,248
You see, the bear was there.

255
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,722
No! There!

256
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:06,296
And Rothgar was... Rothgar was here.

257
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,629
What's this?

258
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:16,165
Creeping into Shield Hall uninvited.

259
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,331
Off you go!

260
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,635
Wait!

261
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,403
What's your name?

262
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,706
Answer him, lad.

263
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,943
Here. Are you hungry?

264
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,260
He wants to see the sword
that killed the bear.

265
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,033
No.

266
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,604
I'll trade you for your name.

267
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,316
Eric.

268
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,219
Eric.

269
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:10,724
A sword for a name.

270
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,696
Just bring it back in one piece.

271
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,703
His parents were killed
by raiders a year ago.

272
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,810
The boy'll be fine.

273
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,438
We take care of our own.

274
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,880
Shields!

275
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,992
Shields!

276
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,425
Shields! It is.

277
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:54,503
Shield! Shield! Shield!

278
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:15,952
You!

279
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,296
Kainan!

280
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,763
You.

281
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:31,000
Kainan! Kainan! Kainan!

282
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:46,014
Up!

283
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,225
Kainan! Kainan!

284
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,433
What now?

285
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,907
Follow me.

286
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,799
The Outlander's good.

287
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:06,494
Care to wager some gold on him?

288
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,703
No one beats Wulfric at shields.

289
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,180
Kainan!

290
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,299
Now you try this.

291
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,485
Oh hell.

292
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,551
Are you ready for this, Boromir?

293
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,697
I am now.

294
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:18,606
Okay.

295
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,742
Not bad.

296
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,159
Sorry.

297
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,237
Outlander, I wanted...

298
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,637
Kainan.

299
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,243
My name is Kainan.

300
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,110
Kainan,

301
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,739
I wanted to thank you for
bringing my father back to me.

302
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,714
For saving his life.

303
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:15,918
It happened so fast
I did it without thinking.

304
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,294
Like when you hit me?

305
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,386
Hit you?

306
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,294
Yes, sorry about that.

307
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,100
We're even now.

308
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:39,809
All the women are talking about you.

309
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:46,186
They say you're from a place
far beyond the ice.

310
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,917
I heard one say from
the home ofthe gods.

311
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,886
What do you think?

312
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,192
I think...

313
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,326
she was a little drunk.

314
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,511
Freya!

315
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,308
Eeveryone thinks that
bear killed your people.

316
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,481
It didn't.

317
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,416
It was the Moorwen and
it will come back.

318
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,462
Get the others!

319
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,435
It's Gunnar!

320
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:26,516
Get out ofhere!

321
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:28,455
Get out ofhere!

322
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,791
Get out ofhere!

323
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:19,933
Rothgar!

324
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,797
It's over. We've lost!

325
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,033
No!

326
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:54,539
Let me go!

327
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,202
Get your hands offme!

328
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,009
Rothgar!

329
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,080
The gate. Close the gate!

330
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,328
Rothgar!

331
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,696
Where are you
you bastard son of a bitch?

332
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,038
Where's my wife?

333
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,504
Where's my boy?

334
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,210
You didn't even leave me their bodies.

335
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,887
If it takes a thousand years

336
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:45,192
I'll carve your heart out
of your rotting chest.

337
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,994
Do you hear me?

338
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:07,041
This is the man you want
to make peace with?

339
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,569
Are you all right?

340
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,334
I'm fine.

341
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,106
That looks deep.

342
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,810
Here let me clean it.

343
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,758
What happened out there?

344
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,494
Who was that?

345
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:02,824
That was Gunnar.

346
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,632
Gunnar?

347
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,766
King Halga, Wulfric's father...

348
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:11,340
called all the tribes together
for a raid on the Franks.

349
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,131
Gunnar never showed.

350
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,801
There was an ambush and
Halga was killed.

351
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,747
So Wulfric thinks
Gunnar betrayed him.

352
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:24,549
And Gunnar thinks his village
was destroyed in revenge.

353
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,388
That's right.

354
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:30,723
Wulfric is simple like his father.

355
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:34,821
He'll send a party into
the treesjust before dawn.

356
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:37,958
And then attack from the main
gate first light.

357
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,507
But I think he's in for a surprise.

358
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,306
Gunnar said wait here.

359
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,249
Aethril?

360
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,597
Circle up. Circle up!

361
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,602
Get Wulfric and Rothgar up here now!

362
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:33,675
What's going on?

363
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,252
Wulfric!

364
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,400
Wait! Don't shoot!

365
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:54,594
Hold your fire. We surrender.

366
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:55,931
It's a trick.

367
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,730
Archers!

368
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:01,537
Ready!

369
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,505
Fire!

370
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,844
Wait!

371
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,255
Hold your fire, you bastards!

372
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,482
Wait!

373
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:26,727
No!

374
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:32,035
Open the gates!

375
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:37,877
Wulfric! No!

376
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,077
Look!

377
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,338
Now that is not a bear.

378
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:14,845
It was like hitting a stone wall.

379
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,042
I hit it with all I had.

380
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,982
Ran. Just like you ran from my father.

381
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,986
I'll cut your tongue out, boy.
Stop!

382
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,454
Both of you.

383
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,752
That thing is still out there!

384
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,258
The gods have cursed us all.

385
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,919
We should leave this place while
we can still save our families.

386
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:27,927
This is our home!

387
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,929
We are not going to let
that thing chase us out!

388
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,294
She's right! We're not leaving.

389
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,994
We're going to hunt this thing
down and kill it like Vikings.

390
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:35,695
Hunting won't work.

391
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:41,905
You can't take it on in the open.

392
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:42,909
It's too powerful.

393
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,308
Well, what else is there?

394
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:45,880
We trap it.

395
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,752
Even if you do track it down,

396
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:51,715
How are you going to kill it?

397
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,216
Why are we even listening to him?
He's not one of us.

398
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,756
That's right. I'm not.

399
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,553
But you're wrong about this, Wulfric.

400
00:59:57,694 --> 01:00:00,390
Like you were wrong about and the bear.

401
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,590
And you'll always be wrong until
you stop thinking with this.

402
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,631
This is finished!

403
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:10,300
You're not one of us.

404
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,340
The decision is ours.

405
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:16,136
However, I'm still your king.

406
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:19,876
And myjudgment is that
the Outlander is correct.

407
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:26,415
We build the trap.

408
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:35,558
So,

409
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,560
where do we start?

410
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:40,968
Here...

411
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:48,302
And ending... here.

412
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,815
What are you waiting for?

413
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,649
Dig!

414
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,940
The forge, what does it burn?

415
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,573
Wood.

416
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,146
What about the torches, the lamps?

417
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,749
Whale oil.

418
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,379
I'll need it.

419
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:30,577
How much?

420
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,017
All ofit.

421
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,739
How's it coming?

422
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,877
Is it deep enough for you?

423
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:01,947
No.

424
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:03,416
Four more feet.

425
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,251
And when you got that...

426
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,118
I need two rows of postholes
running up both sides.

427
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,382
Post holes?

428
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:09,889
Yeah.

429
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:12,256
What do you need post holes for?

430
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:13,792
Posts.

431
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,122
Posts.

432
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,265
Posts.

433
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:46,955
Are we done now?

434
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,154
Not yet.

435
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:50,731
Not yet? What's left?

436
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:53,594
Shields?

437
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:55,033
Shields.

438
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,497
When this thing is over...

439
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,864
...there's a place here for you.

440
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,867
Should you wish it.

441
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,487
You hungry?

442
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,244
What about you?

443
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,815
I'll eat when you're finished.

444
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,110
No.

445
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,647
You sit.

446
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:30,053
Thank you.

447
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,403
I saw you talking to my father today.

448
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:49,606
What did he say?

449
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,379
He asked me to stay.

450
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:57,943
What did you say?

451
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:03,948
Freya...

452
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,661
You don't even know
what kind ofman I am.

453
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:16,897
I know enough.

454
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,638
No, you don't.

455
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:25,345
So, tell me.

456
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,588
Kainan?

457
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,821
My people are no different than yours.

458
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,526
Hungry for land.

459
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,062
So when we found
an island we wanted,

460
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,029
we took it.

461
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:05,413
It didn't matter that it already
belonged to something else...

462
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:11,284
Moorwens. Millions ofthem.

463
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,455
But we wanted it.

464
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,366
After all, we told ourselves
they were nothing.

465
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:23,029
Just animals. Beasts.

466
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:33,977
So we killed them all with fire.

467
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,203
Those we missed, we hunted down.

468
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,946
You obeyed your king's orders.

469
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,515
You didn't have a choice.

470
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:48,384
You always have a choice.

471
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:57,159
Land that belonged to the Moorwens
now belonged to us.

472
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:14,276
As part ofmy pay I was given a place
for my family to live.

473
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,651
And I thought I could forget
what I'd done to get it.

474
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,982
Some things you can't
bury deep enough.

475
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,725
Hey! What are you doing?

476
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,260
That plant, it stung me.
It what?

477
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,193
It stung me.

478
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,793
Let me show you something.
Stay right here, okay?

479
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,653
Kainan.

480
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,458
The guns are up.

481
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,495
And there are none ofthem left.

482
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:05,825
You'll be safe.

483
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:13,133
I love you.

484
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:14,742
I love you, too.

485
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:49,606
Three weeks later I got word that
one ofthe Moorwens had survived.

486
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:54,282
And it got in our compound
and killed everyone.

487
01:10:58,687 --> 01:10:59,984
It was the will ofthe gods.

488
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:00,884
It was their destiny.

489
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,547
There is no destiny.

490
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,356
There is no gods.

491
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:10,760
It wasjust me.

492
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:14,832
And I failed them.

493
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,737
I failed them.

494
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,020
This is a king's sword,

495
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:40,084
passed down from my ancestors.

496
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,691
My father gave it to me...

497
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,526
and told me that one day

498
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,792
I would know the man to give it to.

499
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,001
A good man.

500
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:06,349
If you truly believe that you
write the tale of your own life...

501
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,823
...then the end is up to you.

502
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,153
More arrows!

503
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,607
The gods be with you.

504
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:11,680
Boromir, close the doors.

505
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,366
Open the gates!

506
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:43,948
You sure this will work?

507
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:51,120
That's what I thought.

508
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,052
Hold this.

509
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:21,174
Gods above...

510
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:37,561
Wait for my order!

511
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,020
What's your damn priest doing?

512
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:35,220
I command thee, Lucifer,

513
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,052
quit this place!

514
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,348
Ready!

515
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:21,901
Wulfric!

516
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:24,933
Hold your fire!

517
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:27,307
Shoot!

518
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:28,101
Take my hand!

519
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:28,800
Shoot!

520
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,344
Hold!
Take it now!

521
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,110
Fire!

522
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,155
By the gods!

523
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:24,465
Freya?

524
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:29,202
Freya!

525
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:31,698
Freya!

526
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:39,038
Moorwen!

527
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,003
Kainan

528
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,031
There's another one!

529
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,243
Kainan!

530
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:32,680
Everyone's leaving.

531
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:42,255
Eric, it's not safe here anymore.

532
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:44,799
Everyone's going to the boats.

533
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:47,091
You need to go, too.

534
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:49,426
But, I want to stay here with you.

535
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:52,333
You'll come back soon.

536
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,905
Everyone will.

537
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,607
You promise?

538
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:04,912
I promise.

539
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:43,757
Your boots, do you want them back?

540
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:48,356
No. They're his now.

541
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:51,991
What are you going to do?

542
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,196
You're king now.

543
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:57,803
King of what? This?

544
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:02,100
This... and them...

545
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:05,942
Whatever Herot becomes tomorrow...

546
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,539
will be because of
what you do right now.

547
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:12,710
Let's go kill this thing...

548
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:17,154
...together.

549
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,211
You're daft!

550
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,319
We're not going down there.

551
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:47,011
That's where it came from.

552
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:48,520
That's where we're going.

553
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:50,982
But we don't know how to kill it yet.

554
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,184
We need better weapons.

555
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:55,353
No. We need better metal.

556
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:58,097
Boromir, get the forge ready.

557
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:02,161
Unferth, Olaf, get the torches
and the ropes.

558
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:03,695
Let's go.

559
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:06,206
I'm coming with you.

560
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:10,806
No you're not.

561
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:15,677
That thing killed my father and
destroyed my home.

562
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:17,307
I'm coming with you.

563
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,818
This is where your ship went down?

564
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:28,729
That's right.

565
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:36,166
In a lake?

566
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:41,440
Don't ask.

567
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:39,834
Kainan?

568
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:11,825
Freya?

569
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:14,167
Freya?

570
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:21,734
Where's Freya?

571
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,172
Just get the metal and make the swords!

572
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:29,641
Damn.

573
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,652
What kind ofmetal is this?

574
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:58,945
King's sword again.

575
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:32,005
You're...
I know. Daft.

576
01:29:00,968 --> 01:29:01,957
Let's go.

577
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:33,083
Where's it coming from?

578
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:38,657
It's beneath us.

579
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:06,077
God.

580
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:08,418
I slipped.

581
01:32:25,973 --> 01:32:27,099
Let's keep moving.

582
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:38,583
Ain't nothing down there.

583
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:49,795
Unferth!
Wulfric!

584
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:56,366
Can you see anything?

585
01:32:57,939 --> 01:32:58,837
Over here!

586
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:27,683
Boromir!

587
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:55,648
We'll drink together again, Kainan.

588
01:34:58,459 --> 01:34:59,721
Herot mead.

589
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:03,929
Best in the world.

590
01:35:19,246 --> 01:35:21,180
No!

591
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:25,008
Kainan!

592
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,480
Freya! Freya...!

593
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,923
Kainan!

594
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:37,824
That way!

595
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:41,199
Freya!

596
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:43,828
I'm here.

597
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:29,542
Freya, Freya.

598
01:36:38,826 --> 01:36:39,918
Freya!

599
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:49,563
Freya. Squeeze through!

600
01:36:50,671 --> 01:36:51,228
Squeeze through!

601
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:52,532
Too tight.

602
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:55,201
Take it!

603
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:18,190
Freya, calm down, calm down.

604
01:37:24,138 --> 01:37:26,003
By all the gods.

605
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:51,598
Move!

606
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:25,424
Over there!

607
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,345
Get her out ofhere!

608
01:38:48,322 --> 01:38:49,414
Come on!

609
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,292
Swing me!

610
01:39:26,593 --> 01:39:27,617
Wulfric!

611
01:43:23,664 --> 01:43:24,926
Is it dead?

612
01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:28,692
Yes.

613
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:42,879
I wanted this for so long.

614
01:43:47,521 --> 01:43:49,546
At least I got to wear it for a day.

615
01:43:54,494 --> 01:43:56,860
I hope you wear it for
longer than I did.

616
01:44:00,133 --> 01:44:01,725
We could have been friends.

617
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:04,130
We are friends.

618
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:51,148
Eric.

619
01:44:51,418 --> 01:44:52,407
Up here!

620
01:44:53,153 --> 01:44:54,620
Up here!

621
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:56,756
Up here!

622
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:58,357
Up here!

623
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:16,006
You wait here for the others.

624
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:19,102
I've got something to do.

625
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:22,742
You're not coming back, are you?

626
01:49:28,762 --> 01:49:31,322
In the year ofFour Kings,

627
01:49:31,698 --> 01:49:35,464
Rothgar and Wulfric were laid to rest.

628
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:38,700
Heroes in the war against the Moorwens.

629
01:49:54,154 --> 01:49:58,921
And Kainan, once a stranger to us...

630
01:49:59,459 --> 01:50:01,086
...became king.

631
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:06,758
He took for himself a wife... and a boy,

632
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:09,266
who became as his own son.

633
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:47,101
But only I knew his secret.

634
01:50:48,842 --> 01:50:51,208
That the gods had sent us Kainan.

635
01:50:54,014 --> 01:50:56,539
And when it came time
to return to them...

636
01:50:58,618 --> 01:51:02,213
...he chose to stay with us instead.
