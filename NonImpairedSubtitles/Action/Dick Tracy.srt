1
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:36,202
Gangland enforcers broke the arms of
an elderly news dealer this afternoon...

2
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,372
when he refused to share
his week's receipts with them.

3
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,791
Stacks of newspapers
were tossed in the gutter...

4
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,754
as the thugs wrecked the business
and made their getaway.

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,966
Lunchtime crowds were paralysed
by the suddenness of the crime.

6
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,594
Not a hand was raised in protest!

7
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,684
Organized crime is their name.

8
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,729
What appeared to be organized hoods
shattered the kneecaps...

9
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,357
of the beloved operator
of a shoeshine parlour today...

10
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,609
as horrified customers looked on.

11
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,694
The bootblack would not
give up his receipts...

12
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,614
and paid dearly for his failure
to surrender to gang demands.

13
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,159
A mother of four, unable to pay
a gambling debt, lies dead tonight.

14
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,661
Gangland thugs left her
to expire in a pool of blood...

15
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,498
as they helped themselves
to the contents of a cash register...

16
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,000
inside the luncheonette.

17
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,570
I was talkin' to them,
at the station house, you know, and
it was the darnedest thing I ever saw.

18
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,948
Oh, yeah? Wow.

19
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,784
Five, no help.
King, no help.

20
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,956
- Aces and eights.
- Twenty.

21
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,710
- Ohh.
- Okay, I'm callin'.

22
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,338
Deuce, still possible.
Six, no help.

23
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,299
Got a pair of aces,
a pair of eights.

24
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,469
Okay, the ace bets.

25
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,848
- Hey, Little Face.
- What's the trouble?

26
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,643
Come on, let's go.
Ace bets five.

27
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,646
- I call.
- Six.
- See ya.

28
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,606
What's that?

29
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,030
Cat.

30
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,450
Ohh. A little kitty.

31
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,411
Hi, little fella.

32
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,832
Let's go.
Ace bets five.

33
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,335
- I'm callin'.
- I'm in.

34
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,837
Six, and a possible straight.

35
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,424
Queen, eight,
pair of eights.

36
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,509
Uh, nine, no help.

37
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,472
- Jack, no help.
- King, no help.

38
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,559
Well, Little Face?

39
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:27,332
See what you can find.
I wanna leave a little message here.

40
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,977
Calling Dick Tracy!
Calling Dick Tracy!

41
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,188
- Come in, Pat. This is Tracy.
- What is that?

42
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,608
We got five dead men at the 7th Street
Garage, and nobody knows who they are.

43
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,860
You'd better get over here
right away.

44
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,363
I'm on my way.

45
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,742
I'll be back.
I wanna know how it comes out.

46
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,453
- Excu-- Oh, excuse me.
- Ow!
- Sorry.

47
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,795
- Hello, boys.
- Tracy!
- Here, Chief.

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,966
- Tracy, are we glad to see you.
- Tracy, whoever they are,
they're all dead.

49
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,848
Five dead men, Tracy,
and we don't even know who they are.

50
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,351
Whoever did it
took their identification,
but they didn't take a dime.

51
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,062
Big Boy Caprice.

52
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,191
- Everything all right, Tracy?
- Fine, fine.

53
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,402
Just a little trouble downtown.

54
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,612
Tracy, they're sayin' that
Big Boy's got the city out of control.

55
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,781
- Is that right?
- And what about this rumour they're
movin' you up to chief of police?

56
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:45,201
We've already got an excellent
chief of police, Bert. Why don't you
shave off that silly mustache?

57
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,871
- How about runnin' for mayor, Tracy?
- I'm a cop, Charlie.
I don't wanna take a demotion.

58
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,415
- Hey, Tracy--
- Hey, McNally,
I want a copy of that shot.

59
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,294
- They're sayin' Big Boy's
got the city out of control.
- Still can't get anything on him, huh?

60
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,380
Don't let 'em get to you, Tracy.
You'll get Big Boy.

61
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,300
Big Boy's on the street,
and they wanna stick me behind a desk?

62
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,471
They believe in you, Tracy.
They think if you're Chief of Police,
this city'll be safe.

63
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:09,017
Tess, there's about as much chance of me
gettin' behind a desk as there is of me
gettin' a new girlfriend.

64
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,772
Sooner or later
you're gonna decide

65
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,944
Sooner or later
there's nowhere to hide

66
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:27,744
Baby, it's time
So why waste it in chatter

67
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,081
Let's settle

68
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:35,460
The matter

69
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,587
Baby, you're mine on a platter

70
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:44,094
I always get my man

71
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,769
I'm gonna love you
like nothin' you've known

72
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:59,275
I'm gonna love you
and you all alone

73
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,780
Sooner is better than later

74
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,991
But, lover

75
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,661
I'll hover

76
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:14,374
I'll plan

77
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,584
This time
I'm not only getting

78
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,588
I'm holding my

79
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,842
Man

80
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,682
Bad news on the garage, Lips.

81
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:35,020
They bumped 'em all off.
Our men are getting very nervous.

82
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,315
- Champagne, Miss Mahoney?
- Breathless...

83
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,110
that was beautiful, as always.

84
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,612
I'm so happy you liked it.

85
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,993
- You mind if I leave?
- Why?

86
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,913
- I get sick when you eat.
- You didn't used to.

87
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,417
- You didn't used to be a zeppelin.
- Your devotion is touching.
- Lips!

88
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,836
Lips, it's a raid! It's the cops!

89
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,757
Lips Manlis, you're under arrest
for owning and operating
a gambling establishment.

90
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,343
- Yeah? Where's your warrant?
- Right here. Let's go.

91
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,680
- You too, Breathless.
- I wasn't gamblin', I was singin'.

92
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,266
- Get in the car.
- Flattop.

93
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,394
- These ain't cops!
- Who are they?

94
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,773
Hiya, Lips.
Hiya, Breathless. Let's go.

95
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,962
Even Chief Brandon says you'd make
a wonderful chief of police.

96
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,507
- It's a desk job.
- What's so bad about a desk job anyway?

97
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,426
You think if you sit at a desk
you're playing it safe...

98
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,806
but, Tracy, if you weren't out in the
street every night riskin' your neck,
you could have a wife-- I mean, a life.

99
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:57,060
Nobody's gonna put Big Boy Caprice
behind bars sittin' behind a desk.

100
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,187
Tracy, you said you were gonna
take a day off tomorrow.

101
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,189
- Huh?
- Hmm?

102
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,942
Come on.

103
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,487
- Tracy, did you say you're gonna--
- Sure, but--

104
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,031
- Hey, kid!
- Hey!
- Hey-- Hey!

105
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,075
- Where you goin'?
- Stop him!
- Take it easy.

106
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,328
- Hey, stop!
- Huh?
- He stole my watch!

107
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,081
- Hey, kid. Hey! Hey, kid!
- Stop that boy! Stop that boy!

108
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,750
C-- Come here.
Did you steal this man's watch?

109
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,589
- Hi, Tess.
- The rest of my party should be
arriving any minute.

110
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,096
Come on, kid.
You're makin' a mistake!

111
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,766
It's only a watch! You don't wanna
get yourself in this kind of trouble!

112
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:43,314
Hey! What are you tryin' to do?
You're gonna get hurt, kid!

113
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,735
Be careful!
You're gonna get hurt!

114
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,552
- What'd you get?
- Didn't save me no chicken.

115
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,680
Let's see the stuff.

116
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,441
- That's all?
- Yeah.

117
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,280
Hey, tough guy, you wanna try that
on somebody your own size?

118
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,006
Maybe we should step outside.

119
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:57,138
Okay, tough guy. Now do you want to
give the kid a piece of chicken?

120
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,600
We got a place for people
who beat up kids.

121
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,396
- This cockroach your old man?
- Go suck an egg!

122
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,878
Oh. Look what you did
to your pretty tuxedo.

123
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,381
Big Boy, ain't we pals?

124
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:35,927
No pals in this business, Lips.
You taught me that.

125
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,513
- Sign it.
- The deed to the Club Ritz?

126
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,391
That's right.
I'm goin' into show business now.

127
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,980
You're dirty, Lips.
You need a bath.

128
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,900
Not the bath. Not the bath.
Big Boy, not the bath!

129
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,460
- Hey. You got a name?
- Kid.

130
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,296
- "Kid"?
- Kid.

131
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,132
What's the name
your mother and father gave you?

132
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,552
- What mother and father?
- Who takes care of you?

133
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,846
Who takes care of you?

134
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,850
This is Moriarty. I'm at
the Southside Warehouse. Do you read me?

135
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,102
Repeat, Moriarty.
You're at the Southside Warehouse?

136
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,232
Right. I don't know who they are,
and I can't see what's goin' on inside.

137
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,277
The car was unmarked--

138
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,491
Big Boy, we're friends! Big Boy, not
the bath! Not the bath! We're friends!

139
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,785
- No!
- I know, and I'm gonna miss ya.

140
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,747
But, "all's fair in love and business."
Benjamin Franklin.

141
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,250
Big Boy. Big Boy, Big Boy. Think about
it, Big Boy. How could you do this?

142
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,794
- You.
- Me?

143
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,046
- How do you want it?
- Want it?

144
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:59,010
Around me, if a woman don't wear mink,
she don't wear nothin'.

145
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,681
Well, I look good both ways.

146
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,809
Mumbles! Wipe it off.

147
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:20,365
All right!
Put the word out!

148
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,451
Lips' territory is my territory now!

149
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,123
Everyone who worked for him
is workin' for me.

150
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,376
Everything he owned, I own!

151
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:35,755
Let's get outta here!
Cover that trapdoor!

152
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:43,638
I heard you say you love me

153
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,766
You are my lucky charm

154
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,477
With you here on my arm

155
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,689
Well, I gotta call the welfare society.
Hey, Mike, could I use--

156
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,316
- Wait. The what?
- The boys' home.

157
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,236
Mike, you got any ice cream--
Hey, hey, hey!

158
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,405
- Let go!
- Hey, where you goin'?

159
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,742
- What are you doin'?
- You ain't stickin' me in no orphanage.
I been there.

160
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,494
Hey, hey, come on.
Sit down, sit down.

161
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,998
I'm very sorry, pal.
It's the law. Sit down.

162
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:15,795
Look, kid, if you don't have
a home with a mother and a father,
you go to the orphanage. It's the law.

163
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,758
-Hey, Mike, you got any ice cream?
-Calling Dick Tracy. Calling Dick Tracy.

164
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,177
Bring the kid some ice cream.
Come in, Sam.

165
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,306
Southside Warehouse on the river, Tracy.
Somethin's goin' on.

166
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:30,769
- You'd better get down there.
- I'm on my way.

167
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,938
Hey, Tracy,
what about the eating machine?

168
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,900
Huh? Oh.
Can you watch him or somethin'?

169
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,611
Watch him do what?

170
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:44,240
Uh, well, uh--

171
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:49,037
Uh, just take him to my place.
I'll tell Pat to call the orphanage.

172
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:58,421
- You two married?
- No. Would you like a broken arm?

173
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,680
- I don't like dames.
- Good. Me neither.

174
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,487
- Walnuts.
- Walnuts?

175
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,365
Tracy, there is a widow to whom a few
words need to be said in bereavement.

176
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,284
Pat, bring in Flattop and ltchy.
Sam, get these fingerprinted.

177
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,496
- Flattop and ltchy? For what?
- I wanna find Lips Manlis fast.

178
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,124
- With a handful of walnuts?
- Yeah, with a handful of walnuts?

179
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,626
Walnuts?

180
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,845
- All right, all right, all right.
- Hello, gentlemen.

181
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,723
- Where's Lips Manlis?
- Who's Lips Manlis?

182
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:53,226
Yeah, who's Lips Manlis? We get to make
one phone call. That's the law.

183
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:57,731
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Gimme the phone.

184
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,233
There's the phone.
Be my guest.

185
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,486
Make a note, Pat.
They waived their right to a phone call.

186
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,613
- Right, Tracy.
- Hey, copper.

187
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,617
Maybe you oughta look
before you leap, huh? We got rights.

188
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,828
Take the bad men away.
They scare me.

189
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,789
- Up, up. Outta here.
- Yeah? Well, we got rights too,
you know.

190
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,208
- Take your story walkin' with ya.
- See ya around, Tracy, huh?

191
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,794
- Come on.
- All right, all right.

192
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,005
- Eh, get your mitts off me.
- You can't do this, Tracy.

193
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,842
- The D.A.'ll say
you're badgering witnesses.
- Get me Mumbles.

194
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,304
- Tracy'll get you a drink.
- I tell you, I don't know.

195
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,389
I don't know.
You have no right to do that.

196
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:35,894
- Hello, Mumbles.
- What right have they
to talk to me that way?

197
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,104
- What's the matter with you?
- Where's Lips Manlis?

198
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:43,318
- I don't have to tell you anything!
- Where's Lips Manlis?

199
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,737
Got my diamonds

200
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,114
- Got my yacht
- Yacht!

201
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,492
Got a guy I adore

202
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,827
A guy I adore!
Let's hear it! Let's hear it!

203
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:57,374
- I'm so happy with what I got
- You're on. Life, life, life. Let's go.

204
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,501
- Stretch it! Stretch it!
- I want more

205
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,295
More! I want more!

206
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,714
- Count your blessings
- Count your blessings.

207
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,467
One, two, three

208
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,053
- I just hate keeping score
- I hate it!

209
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,097
I hate keepin' score.
Let's show it! Move it!

210
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,725
- Any number is fine with me
- Touch it! Touch it!
I want it! Touch it!

211
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,645
- Grab it! More!
- As long as it's mine

212
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,690
More! Let's go!

213
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,943
- Come on! More!
- More, more

214
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,861
More! Good!

215
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,072
If you got a little
why not a lot

216
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,700
Add a bit and it'll
get to be an oodle

217
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,077
- Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
- Gotta pick it up. Gotta pick it up.

218
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,538
Soon, you got the kit
as well as the caboodle

219
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,040
- More
- Up, up! Up, up! Come on!

220
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,251
- More
- Up! Up! Higher, higher! Let's go!

221
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,628
Never say when
Never stop at plenty

222
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,089
- If it's gonna rain, let it pour
- That's good, that's good.

223
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,299
Happy with ten
Happier with twenty

224
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:53,471
- If you like a penny
wouldn't you like many, many more
- Penny-- Wouldn't you like many--

225
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:58,226
- Or does that sound too greedy
- Pick it up, right here.

226
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:02,856
- That's not greed, no, indeedy
- That's not-- No, indeedy!

227
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:07,861
- That's just stocking the store
- Give it to me!

228
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:11,406
I don't know. You wanna do this?
You wanna talk? Turn on the light,
I'm gonna talk to you, you know.

229
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,783
I-- I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

230
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,161
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it. There.

231
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,246
I don't know what you want.
I didn't do it.

232
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,207
Mumbles, where's Lips Manlis?

233
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:25,628
- Okay. Kick it up. Kick it up!
- That's what soothing about success

234
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,131
- Come on, down further.
- Never settle

235
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,217
- For something less
- Oh! Push it higher and higher.

236
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,971
- Something's better than nothing, yes
- Run around, run around!

237
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,640
And nothing's better than

238
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:42,228
- More, more
- Push it up!

239
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:47,442
More, more, more, more
More, more, more

240
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:52,113
No! No! It's wrong! It's off! It's
wrong! It doesn't work! It's not good!

241
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,532
- Boss. Boss!
- What?

242
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,826
I'm sorry.
These girls are tired.

243
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,995
Yeah. We been doin' it all night.
It's 2:00 a.m.

244
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,164
"It's 2:00 a.m."?

245
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:06,294
I'm about to turn this dump
into the birthplace
of a new era of entertainment...

246
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,672
you're telling me it's 2:00 a.m.?

247
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,800
- Play the piano!
- Hey! That was a silly thing to do.

248
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:16,137
- He's the best piano player in town.
- Shut up!

249
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,890
Come here.

250
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:23,144
Next time I take his fingers
and I turn 'em into pretzels.

251
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,272
I just might do the same thing
to your face.

252
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:35,448
See?
He's playin' better already.

253
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,284
Let's go.
From the toppy-top.

254
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,787
From the top.

255
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,792
Care for some water?
I'm thirsty.

256
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,593
- Where's Lips Manlis?
- Gimme that.

257
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,054
Where's Lips Manlis?

258
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,154
Okay, you heard him, Mrs Green.
That's his testimony.

259
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,322
- Okay, boys, get him outta here.
- His wh-- His what?

260
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:22,454
- Get him.
- Hey, hey. Come on with me, Mumbles.
- Impossible. Just impossible.

261
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,002
That's coercion, Tracy.
Even if you get anything, it's illegal.

262
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:33,631
Just tell the boys in the lab,
fingerprint those walnuts
by 8:00 in the morning 'cause

263
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,592
- You're what?
- It's the fifth time!
- Yep. Fifth time. That's right.

264
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,386
- It's a gamble
if you can't make it stick.
- Big gamble, Tracy.

265
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,514
Leavin' Big Boy on the street.
Now let's go get him.

266
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,893
No, indeedy

267
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,604
-That's just stocking--
-Hello, Big Boy. I brought your garbage.

268
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,190
- Tracy.
- We meet again, huh? Where's Lips?

269
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,276
This is a private club, copper.
You got a membership card?

270
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,736
- Do you?
- I own it.

271
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,113
- Since when?
- Today.

272
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,866
- I made a deal with Lips.
- Lips.

273
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,910
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

274
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,663
- Must've left town or somethin'.
- Well, that's a coincidence.

275
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,917
My new girl, Breathless Mahoney,
meet Dick Tracy...

276
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,544
servant of the people, like me.

277
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,422
- You like walnuts, don't you, Big Boy?
- I love 'em.

278
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,841
A lot of people like walnuts.
They're good for the liver.

279
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,803
Yeah, but they're bad for the brain.
You're sloppy, Big Boy.

280
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,681
You're under arrest.
Get him outta here, boys.

281
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,726
- We got a nice place for him to sleep
where they don't serve walnuts.
- We'll get ya in a half hour, Boss.

282
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,979
- I'm performing
the opening number, Boss.
- This ain't a break!

283
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:33,191
- Keep rehearsin'! Get my lawyer.
- See ya in a half hour, Boss.

284
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,736
Tell 'em it's Flatfoot.
He's at it again, and he's got no case.

285
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,923
-Hello?
-You're breaking and entering, you know.

286
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,718
- Sorry.
- Sit down.

287
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,560
Aren't you gonna arrest me?

288
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:12,480
If I were gonna arrest you,
I'd have done it by now.

289
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,567
Then what are you up to, honey?

290
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:20,572
I think Lips Manlis is dead, and
I want you to tell me who killed him.

291
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:27,328
Or maybe you weren't on his side.
Whose side are you on?

292
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:31,541
The side I'm always on.
Mine.

293
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:36,004
- No grief for Lips?
- I'm wearing black underwear.

294
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,803
You know, it's legal for me
to take you down to the station and
sweat it out of you under the lights.

295
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,265
I sweat a lot better in the dark.

296
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:54,981
I know how you feel. You don't know
if you wanna hit me or kiss me.

297
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,984
- I get a lot of that.
- Look, you're safe.

298
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:02,364
Big Boy's in jail. You're the one
that can keep him there. Give me a call.

299
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,923
You can do a little two-step

300
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,717
I'll go anywhere that you step to

301
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,762
'Cause now I'm followin' you

302
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,474
My feet

303
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,686
Might be fallin' out of rhythm

304
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:36,022
- Don't know what I'm doin' with 'em--
- My gosh. What time is it?

305
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,484
- It's 6:30.
- I have to get to the greenhouse.

306
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,487
- I've got those new delphiniums
coming in.
- Oh.

307
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,031
Pat says he's gonna
call the orphanage today.

308
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,951
- Tracy, you might try watering those.
- Tess.

309
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:51,162
- Mm-hmm?
- Thanks for watchin' the kid.

310
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,707
- Night, Tracy.
- Uh, Tess.

311
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,086
You know, you're one in a million.

312
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,922
Romance him if he begs you to

313
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:04,342
Now I'm followin' you

314
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:10,056
Oh, Tracy, good night.

315
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:13,268
Oh, by the way, Tracy,
have a good sleep.

316
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,520
Rompin'
Rompin' stompin'

317
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,273
I'm rompin'
Rompin' stompin'

318
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:23,319
I'm rompin'
Rompin' stompin' all day

319
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,584
- You tried the iodine transfer?
- Yes, Tracy.

320
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,336
- And the silver nitrate?
- Twice.

321
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,880
Big Boy Caprice's fingerprints
are not on those walnuts, Tracy.

322
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,257
Well, I had to take the gamble.
What is it, Sam?

323
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,468
Tess is waiting, boy's department,
Marshall and Bradbury.

324
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:52,015
She says she's not gonna
go for a drive in the country
with that kid if he's wearing

325
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,394
Police brutality, boys.
And this is the fifth time.

326
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,438
Lucky for me I don't bruise easily.

327
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:01,733
Mr Caprice, do you intend
to take legal action against the city
for false arrest?

328
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,527
Why should I blame the city
for something one man is doing?

329
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:07,155
This Tracy character's unstable.
The city should get rid of him.

330
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,033
- You mean,
if you don't get rid of him first.
- Who said that?

331
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,870
Hey, there's Fletcher!

332
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:17,540
"Law without order is as great a danger
to the people as order without law."

333
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,292
Jefferson.

334
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,087
How can I support
a maverick police detective...

335
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,508
who keeps making false arrests
of private citizens
and throwing them in jail?

336
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,760
- Tracy, I am district attorney--
- Tracy!

337
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,012
Tess can't get the kid to take off
these smelly clothes.

338
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,057
Chief, I am a candidate for mayor.

339
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,727
If you can't control Detective Tracy,
you'll just have to take him off duty.

340
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:41,231
Or I'll have to prosecute him
and take you off duty.

341
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:45,276
Tracy, Tess is havin' a terrible time
with this kid. What should I do?

342
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,614
Hey, hey, hey! Come here!
Come here! Hey, come on!

343
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,075
- You don't have to wear
what Tess tells you to wear.
- No!

344
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,370
Come here! Where you goin'?
What are you runnin' away from?

345
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,665
- I don't need no suit.
A suit's for school.
- School?

346
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,836
You can't fool me. That means
the orphanage. I ain't wearin' no suit.

347
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,714
Kid, your clothes
don't smell very good. Okay?

348
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,676
Now, if you don't wanna wear a suit,
just go back in there and say
you don't wanna wear a suit.

349
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,012
Otherwise, pick the suit you like.

350
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:18,393
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

351
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:23,356
Just we two, flyin' high
and hiding up in a tree

352
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:28,069
Live alone and like it
That's the answer for me

353
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,781
Don't come out of that tree
That's the answer--

354
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,951
Get your mitts off of me!
I can do it myself!

355
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,203
- Oww!
- Get outta here!

356
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:41,166
- The young man will be out
in a moment, I presume.
- All right, when do we eat?

357
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,751
Live alone and like it

358
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:46,046
- Free as the birds in the trees
- When do we eat?

359
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:48,381
High above the briers
Live alone and like it

360
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:51,134
I do whatever I please

361
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,927
- When do we eat?
- What my heart desires

362
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:57,223
Free to hang around
or fly at any old time

363
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,518
- When do we eat?
- No equivocation

364
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,396
Most of all, no guarantees

365
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,232
That's my only motto
Free of obligations

366
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,402
- Only the murmurin' breeze
- When do we eat?

367
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:12,489
As an obbligato
Live alone and like it

368
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,742
Why is that such a crime

369
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:18,620
Free to call the tune

370
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,664
Free to say
if I'm gonna work or play

371
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,292
I can have the moon

372
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:27,796
But I don't have to have it
night and day

373
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:31,675
Anyway, what I like is gliding
where the wind takes me to

374
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,511
Flyin' high
and hiding up in a tree

375
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:39,224
Live alone and like it
That's the answer for me

376
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:42,185
Don't come out of that tree

377
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,479
That's the answer for me

378
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,691
- Nice day.
- Yeah.

379
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,276
Uh...

380
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,576
What?

381
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:03,832
- I been thinkin', Tess.
- What about?

382
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:07,335
- Well, you living alone.
- Oh, I like living alone.

383
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,047
-Huh?
-You know that. I'm not the lonely type.

384
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,842
Well...

385
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,052
that's somethin' we got in common.

386
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:18,304
Yep. We have that in common.

387
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,974
Well, don't you think that,
since we have so much in common...

388
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:26,813
it might be a good idea
if we just went ahead and--

389
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:31,651
Yes?

390
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:34,779
Uh, well...

391
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,549
Look, l-l-l-l wasn't thinkin'
about you livin' alone...

392
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:58,136
as much as l-- I was--
I was thinkin' about me livin' alone.

393
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:01,181
- I mean--
- What?
- Hey, Tracy, watch out!

394
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,192
- Tracy, wait!
- Hey, are you all right, kid?

395
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,194
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Thanks for the tip.

396
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,113
- Who was it, Tracy?
- I don't know, kid.

397
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:20,367
- I thought we was goners.
- They're just tryin' to scare us.
They're just tryin' to scare us.

398
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,787
Geez, this is incredible!
What are we waitin' for? Let's get 'em!

399
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:27,874
Let's get 'em! Come on, let's go!
We can still get 'em!

400
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:31,378
- They took a right! I saw!
- I'm sorry.

401
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:34,381
- This is amazing, Tracy!
Come on! Let's go!
- Tracy.

402
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:38,385
When you play in the street,
it's part of the game-- I know that.

403
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,555
- Just don't ask me to like it.
- Come on, let's go!

404
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,978
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

405
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,231
They headed up towards Main Street.

406
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,733
W-Who was it, Tracy?

407
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:56,820
I don't know, boys. Do me a favour.
Stick around here, will ya?

408
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,988
Sure, Tracy.

409
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:37,360
Police have hit a stone wall
in their search for the perpetrators...

410
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:42,907
and the citizens of the peace-abiding
neighborhoods are up in arms
over the relentless gunfire

411
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:47,412
Crime is rampant in the streets. The
only general who can take them back--

412
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:52,709
Thanks for calling.
I was beginning to wonder
what a girl had to do to get arrested.

413
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:58,506
Well, wearing that dress
is a step in the right direction.

414
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:12,395
Are you gonna make a move,
or do I have to do everything?

415
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,607
I'm on duty.

416
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,818
- What's your day off?
- Sunday.

417
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:22,530
It's a big world.
Must be Sunday somewhere.

418
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:32,040
Seem hot to you?

419
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,542
Hot?

420
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,716
Why'd you call me here?

421
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:46,554
You know that car?

422
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:56,064
What I'm looking for is a driver.
Preferably one with some mileage.

423
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,608
Yeah?

424
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:06,574
I called you here 'cause I wanted
to know if you're ready to testify.

425
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:21,631
No.

426
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,143
You're right, Tracy.
Why would you get mixed up with me?

427
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:35,854
I'm a cheap floozie to you.

428
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:40,900
I'll be lucky if I get through the week
alive. They probably followed me here.

429
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:45,989
It isn't easy, Tracy.

430
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:49,534
You wanna throw me in jail?
Go ahead.

431
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,382
- Let's dance
- Watch the kid.

432
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:07,635
You can do a little two-step

433
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:10,388
I'll go anywhere that you step to

434
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:13,516
'Cause now I'm following you

435
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:17,228
My feet

436
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:20,440
Might be fallin' out of rhythm

437
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,609
Don't know
what I'm doin' with 'em

438
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,945
But I know I'm following you

439
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:46,174
I remember all of you
from when I was nothin'.

440
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:51,179
Pruneface, you tossed a fire bomb in my
car one night. Give me a lot of trouble,
but I forgive you.

441
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:55,600
Mocca, you put three slugs into me,
but I lived. I forgive you too.

442
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:59,354
I owe everybody at this table a little
somethin', but I forgive all of you.

443
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:04,526
Why? Because I put the past
in the past.

444
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:08,196
However, a boss who cannot
see the future...

445
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:10,865
becomes a liability
to everyone concerned.

446
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,576
What are you, a fortune-teller?
What do you mean, the future?

447
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,248
Pruneface, what I mean...

448
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:20,500
is the future is me.

449
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,255
Pat, Sam, come in. This is Tracy.
I followed her to the Club Ritz.

450
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,718
It looks like we got
every hood in town in one room--
Pruneface, Flattop, Johnny Ramm.

451
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:32,846
- Those guys hate each other.
- Better get over here fast.

452
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:36,057
- I gotta find out why they're together.
- All right, let's go.

453
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:39,561
Baby, you're mine on a platter

454
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:42,230
I always

455
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:46,026
Get my

456
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:56,494
We got a problem with organization.
We're all split up. That's bad business.

457
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,372
While we're divided,
the cops can keep us under control.

458
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:03,835
But use your imaginations.
We form this big company, see.

459
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,590
Each of us here at the table
are on the board of directors.

460
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,925
- I'm chairman of the board.
- Why you?

461
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:16,389
Because I have a vision.

462
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:19,309
A big boss must have a vision.

463
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:24,606
We got a town with thousands
of small stores and businesses,
people who are workin' real hard.

464
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:28,193
I think they should be
workin' real hard for us...

465
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:32,447
because we are for the people.

466
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:39,454
And "if you ain't for the people,
you can't buy the people." Lincoln.

467
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:43,208
We will become
the people's silent partner.

468
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:48,088
Every time some citizen buys
a pound of hamburger, we get a nickel.

469
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:51,383
Every time some guy gets a haircut,
we get a dime.

470
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:55,136
We'll dress like bankers,
join the Rotary Club.

471
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:58,431
Together we will own this town.

472
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,518
Why you?

473
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:04,938
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

474
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:08,233
When do we kill Dick Tracy?

475
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:12,821
As you know, if anything happens
to Tracy, I'm the prime suspect.

476
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:16,741
- Leave Dick Tracy to me.
- I say we kill Tracy now.

477
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:19,035
- You say?
- I say.

478
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,458
I say you say nothing.
I say you get behind me, we all profit.

479
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:28,128
You challenge me,
we all go down.

480
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:33,425
There was one Napoleon,
one Washington, one me.

481
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,220
I'm out.

482
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:40,765
It only works if we're all in.

483
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:44,728
Then it don't work.

484
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:48,356
I got a good business.
I'll take my chances alone.

485
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:55,113
Let him go, let him go.
It's still a free country.

486
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:02,954
Maybe he'll have a change of heart.

487
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:09,169
Sam, I'm worried about Tracy. What would
it take to make you go off your trolley?

488
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,463
Not me. I'm not the type.

489
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,798
Tracy, are you crazy?
You don't have a search warrant.

490
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,593
If you don't get off that ledge,
do you have any idea
what the D.A. will do to you?

491
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:19,763
-Yeah, Tracy, this is Pat. Come on down.
-Just be ready to get me outta here.

492
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,477
Who's that? Spaldoni?

493
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:27,687
I think that's Spaldoni leaving.

494
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:31,274
If any of those bums find you up there,
Tracy, the chief'll never forgive you.

495
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:35,320
Come on, Tracy, get off that building.
If they catch you, they got a perfect
right to do whatever they want.

496
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:37,864
- Great Scott!
- Great Scott!

497
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,085
Very upsetting.

498
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:56,424
Go, Sam! Get him!

499
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,406
Peppermint. Try some.

500
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:25,912
You know, Tracy, for a tough guy
you do a lot of pansy things.

501
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:29,207
Is that right?

502
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,501
- Who is it?
- Mr Tracy?

503
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:33,920
- Who is it?
- I'm Mrs Skaff.

504
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,298
- I'm from the welfare department.
- The welfare department?

505
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:41,720
I'm afraid we're going to have to
take the little boy to the orphanage.

506
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,972
Well, just give me one minute,
Mrs Skaff.

507
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:46,683
I hope you understand, Mr Tracy.

508
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:52,063
As a single man, you can't just
pick up a child from the streets
and take him home.

509
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:55,608
- Mrs Skaff, let's discuss this.
- He belongs in the orphanage.
It's the law.

510
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:59,112
Then he has to be processed
through the proper channels. And then--

511
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:04,117
Uh, Mrs Skaff, if you'll just leave
this situation to me, I think you'll--

512
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:09,914
- We don't want no kid, copper.
- Yeah, we don't want no kid, copper.
Get dressed.

513
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:21,468
Go on, get in there,
or I'll plug ya. Go on.

514
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:39,903
Glad you could join us, Tracy.

515
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:44,240
We thought you'd be
much more comfortable meeting us here
in the basement of your girlfriend's

516
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:46,493
while she's away at work.

517
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:49,579
You know, Dick--
You mind if I call you Dick?

518
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:54,834
My associates here would very much
like to see you have a little accident.

519
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,379
But I tell 'em no.

520
00:38:57,504 --> 00:39:02,801
I'll take care of Tracy myself,
I tell 'em. You know why?

521
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:08,306
I want you on my side!
And let me tell you what my side is.

522
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:13,311
My side is a lifetime of action
and adventure with no clock to punch.

523
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:16,231
It's treatin' that gal of yours
one hundred percent.

524
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:20,151
She should be treated like a princess,
protected like a baby.

525
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:23,905
- You gonna put
all that money down there?
- Fifteen thousand clams.

526
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:30,829
- It's a deal.
- Fifteen thousand clams!

527
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:36,459
Welcome to new waters, Dick! We're gonna
run one hell of a ship with you aboard.

528
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:40,338
There's a big world out there,
and it's up for sale, all of it.

529
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:44,384
All we gotta do is make sure
that the people know...

530
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:46,469
I'm the one
big enough to run it.

531
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:51,975
And that you are guilty of attempting
to bribe an officer of the law.

532
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,060
- Hey, hey!
- Not so fast, copper.

533
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:57,188
- You dumb dick.
- Let's give it to 'im!

534
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:59,649
- Okay, boys!
- Do it!

535
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:03,194
You have just said goodbye to oxygen.

536
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:08,950
You silly, stupid cop.
You refuse me?

537
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:12,162
I offer you the keys to a kingdom...

538
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:15,206
and you tell me
you're an officer of the law.

539
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,918
I am the law! Me!

540
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:24,257
Boys, you guaranteed me that
this is gonna look like an accident.

541
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:27,010
Don't disappoint me.
So long, sucker.

542
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:30,889
- You should've made the deal.
- Yeah!

543
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:36,186
You're gonna have
one terrible accident, Tracy.
You think they're gonna find your body?

544
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:38,980
- Dumb dick.
- I didn't think Tracy'd take a bribe.

545
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:44,652
Ouch! This accident's been waitin'
to happen all day, Tracy.

546
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:48,448
You sure you don't wanna
change your mind? Huh?

547
00:40:57,582 --> 00:41:00,794
- I guess that's the end of Dick.
- Yeah. Thirty seconds, no more Dick.

548
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,630
Thirty seconds, no more Dick.
Thirty seconds, no more Dick.

549
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:11,888
Hey, Tracy!

550
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:14,933
Kid! Get outta here!
Get away from there!

551
00:41:25,735 --> 00:41:31,157
Hurry! It's gonna explode!
Get outta here, kid! Get outta here!

552
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:39,666
Don't worry, Tracy!
I'll get you outta here!

553
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,771
Hit the dirt!

554
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:21,624
- Geez, Tracy, that was a lot of dough.
- You're all right, kid.

555
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,878
For action in the face of grave danger,
the Kid...

556
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,380
whose name will be filled in
when he thinks of one...

557
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:31,176
is awarded this honorary
detective certificate with badge.

558
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:35,680
- Congratulations, pal.
- The best-lookin' officer on the force,
with or without a name.

559
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:39,059
Well, this is just
a temporary certificate
till you pick a name for yourself.

560
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:41,186
- What's the matter with Kid?
- Nothin'.

561
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:44,356
This means no more jumpin'
on the back of cars. Got it?

562
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:46,941
- Tracy.
- When does his certificate
become permanent?

563
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:50,779
- I got a badge for you.
- When he picks a name.
- What do you mean?

564
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:54,240
- Look in your top drawer.
- He's already got the makin's
of a detective.

565
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:57,952
- Chief, it's temporary
till he picks a name, huh?
- Sure. He'll pick a name.

566
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,457
Couple of years, this kid'll be drivin'.
Maybe I'll make him my partner.

567
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:05,669
Sam, that's somethin', isn't it?
How'd you like to pick your own name?

568
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:10,840
- Put 'er there, Detective.
- You know what I'd pick? I'd pick Sam.

569
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:14,719
What's the matter?
We're not payin' you enough money?

570
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:19,349
Don't tell me about my boys
messin' up the Tracy rub-out.

571
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:21,559
They were being tested.
They flunked.

572
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:24,562
Now they're just flunkies, like you.

573
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:27,107
I don't care if Tracy
puts one and one together.

574
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:30,151
Don't matter to me.
You're still workin' for me.

575
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:34,114
You're on my side.
You're not out. You're not out!

576
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,993
When you are dead, then you are out.
You are mine. I own you.

577
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:04,978
Tracy, we've got 14 witnesses.

578
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:08,815
They all insist Big Boy spent
the entire morning at a dance lesson.

579
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,317
- Uh-huh.
- I am sorry.

580
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:18,575
I'll be just a second, Tess.

581
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:28,168
- What kind of ice cream did you get?
- Fresh peach.

582
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:32,505
Better eat it right away.
It's starting to run a little.

583
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,008
What are you doing here?

584
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:44,100
- What are you doin' here?
- Aren't you gonna frisk me?

585
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:49,606
You're so good with names,
what's a name that you like?

586
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:54,027
Well, I don't know.
Herbert, Horace, Thomas, Edgar.
Anything's better than Kid.

587
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:57,030
- Hold this.
- Well, I like Kid.

588
00:44:57,155 --> 00:45:02,619
Well, if you want that detective
certificate to be permanent,
you gotta pick a name.

589
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,579
Gimme.

590
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:12,253
- She's pretty.
- She's a lot more than that.

591
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:28,436
Look, if I testify against Big Boy,
he'll have me bumped off.

592
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:31,940
- He'd have to bump me off first.
- Why?

593
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:35,443
Because I'd be protecting you
24 hours a day.

594
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:39,322
- You would?
- Yeah. That's my job.

595
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:43,034
Do you always put so much of yourself
into your job?

596
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:54,462
You're not gonna know that
till you testify.

597
00:45:56,631 --> 00:46:00,176
You're a good man, Tracy.

598
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:03,096
And I wanna do the right thing.

599
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:07,767
Come here.

600
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,944
Hey, what's the hurry?
Where's the fire?

601
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:21,823
Throwin' a ball in a trash can.
Is that supposed to be some big deal?

602
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:32,417
- Tess, uh, this is--
- I know who she is.

603
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:36,046
- Hello, Miss Mahoney.
- You must be Miss Trueheart.

604
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:39,924
- Tracy's told me so much about you.
- Oh?

605
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,927
He doesn't know
so awfully much about me.

606
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:49,851
Yeah, uh--
uh, thanks for comin' by.

607
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:52,979
- We'll be in touch, Tracy.
- Right. Uh--

608
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:58,526
Miss Trueheart.

609
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,447
What a cute little boy.

610
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:11,581
I'll bet she does
some nifty undercover work.

611
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:15,669
Well, we're makin' our move
on the Club Ritz tonight, uh--

612
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:18,046
Oh, is this-- is this pistachio?

613
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:21,466
Now, that's what I call a dame.
What was she doin' here?

614
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:24,552
She knows somethin'.
I'm tryin' to get her to testify.

615
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:28,765
You know what, Tracy?
You oughta let me talk to her.

616
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:33,645
Is this 88 Keys?
I got a deal for ya.

617
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,690
Meet me at the city car barn
in one hour.

618
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:39,025
That's right. One hour.

619
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:57,919
Up here, 88.

620
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:03,383
Open the suitcase.

621
00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:06,052
Do you want to know why I called you?

622
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:10,724
Five thousand.
Your first payment.

623
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:12,934
For what?

624
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:18,648
You work for Big Boy now. You wanna
make a lot of money helping him?

625
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:21,651
- Yes or no?
- Yeah.

626
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,572
Give that letter to Big Boy.

627
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:30,160
Tell him you found it
under your door.

628
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:33,997
Who do I tell him you are?

629
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:37,500
You don't,
because you never saw me.

630
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:42,547
And don't try to find me.
I'll call you.

631
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:45,175
Make the deal.

632
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:56,978
"If you kill Dick Tracy,
you will be the prime suspect
and the city will mobilize against you.

633
00:48:57,103 --> 00:49:01,900
"But for ten percent of your business
we guarantee Dick Tracy will not be
a problem for you any more...

634
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:05,028
and you will not be suspected
of anything."

635
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:12,077
What can you lose?
They don't deliver, you don't pay.

636
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:16,998
You're a piano player.
What do you want to be, a radish?

637
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:20,418
Don't bring me a deal from someone you
never saw, you don't know how to get to.

638
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:24,464
Get him outta here. Go ahead.
Play the piano. Okay, what's this?

639
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:26,424
I think I got this figured out.
I'm gonna--

640
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:30,178
- Hey. Got a match?
- I think we can work it out
this way, Big Boy.

641
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:32,430
- What was that all about?
- My income tax.

642
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:34,641
Hey!

643
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:41,147
Come here.

644
00:49:41,272 --> 00:49:44,693
- You want me to follow him?
- Where, to the piano?

645
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:51,866
That was none of your business.
Come here.

646
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:55,453
I'm your business.
Okay, Numbers, let's see your numbers.

647
00:49:55,578 --> 00:49:57,539
So then we get the same percentage
from the laundries--

648
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:06,256
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Come on, Tracy, take me with you.

649
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:12,137
Get back in there and brush your teeth.
Go on. And wish me luck tonight.

650
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:17,434
I'll see you later.

651
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:25,442
Move in and take your positions.

652
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:33,074
Sooner or later
you're gonna be mine

653
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:35,326
- Two.
- Sooner or later

654
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:39,039
You're gonna be mine

655
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:42,917
Baby, it's time that you faced it

656
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:49,466
I always get my man

657
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:55,930
Got to hand it to you, Big Boy. You got
the best broads in town. Top drawer.

658
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:58,725
You're gonna decide

659
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:06,649
Come in, Tracy. Come in, Tracy.

660
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:09,069
- This is Tracy, Sam.
- We made it.

661
00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:12,697
Why waste it in chatter

662
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:16,368
-Careful, Tracy. The waiters carry guns.
-We'll settle

663
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:20,997
The matter

664
00:51:21,122 --> 00:51:23,208
Baby, you're mine on a platter

665
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:27,587
- I always get my man
- Come in, Tracy. All set.

666
00:51:27,712 --> 00:51:31,049
- Okay, boys, let's go.
- This is it. Keep it quiet.
Keep it quiet.

667
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:37,931
How could you-- All right.

668
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:41,976
All right, all right. I got it
under control. I got it. Please.

669
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:44,771
Everybody, it's okay!
Please! Please!

670
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:47,857
Okay-- No, no!
I got it under control! Everybody!

671
00:51:47,982 --> 00:51:51,111
No! No, look, folks.
It's okay. Everything's under con--

672
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:56,241
Just sit down. Everything.
Relax. It's easy.

673
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:59,703
Get this thing taken care of.
It's okay. No, everything's all right.

674
00:52:09,462 --> 00:52:12,507
Okay, Bill, that side of the room.
Frank, cover the bar.

675
00:52:12,632 --> 00:52:16,553
Hello, Big Boy. The gang's all here.
What is it, a class reunion?

676
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:19,639
This is a private party, mister.
Invitation only.

677
00:52:19,764 --> 00:52:21,224
- The more you resist, babe
- Here's my invitation.

678
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:24,561
- A search warrant.
- The more it excites me

679
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:28,356
And no one I've kissed, babe

680
00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:33,028
Ever fights me again

681
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:40,744
You're on my list

682
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:45,582
- Because it's just a question of when
- No gamblin', no nothin', Tracy.

683
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:48,293
What, you mean
you thought we had gambling here?

684
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,712
I wouldn't be caught dead
in a place that permitted gambling.

685
00:52:50,837 --> 00:52:54,090
- I'll be back, Big Boy.
- Listen, tell me when you're comin'.

686
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:56,593
- I'll have a big party waitin' for ya.
- Let's go, boys.

687
00:52:56,718 --> 00:53:02,182
- Right, Tracy.
- Then, baby, amen

688
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:05,727
- Hey, hey.
- I thought you was gonna
take care of Tracy.

689
00:53:05,852 --> 00:53:07,979
He didn't look around.
Did you notice?

690
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:11,733
- Yeah.
- I don't get it.
- He was just tryin'

691
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:14,027
- How'd it go?
- Clockwork.

692
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:18,948
Well, let's just hope
Big Boy thinks I'm too stupid
to look under the top of a table.

693
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:23,286
Pat, I am gonna get him.
It's just a question of when.

694
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:31,131
Sooner or later
you're gonna be fine

695
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,759
Baby, it's time that you faced it

696
00:53:34,926 --> 00:53:40,015
I always get my man

697
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:43,852
All right, listen to me.
Get over to 132 Broad Street.

698
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:47,230
- 132 Broad Street.
- But if you resist, babe
- Okay, 132 Broad Street.

699
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:51,818
- Right, Bug.
- The challenge delights me

700
00:53:51,943 --> 00:53:56,781
The more you resist, babe
the more it excites me

701
00:53:56,906 --> 00:53:58,950
Dick Tracy has struck tonight
and he has struck hard...

702
00:53:59,075 --> 00:54:02,037
- And no one I've kissed, babe
- right at the heart
of the gang lord empire.

703
00:54:02,162 --> 00:54:10,670
Ever fights me again

704
00:54:10,795 --> 00:54:14,299
If you're on my list

705
00:54:14,424 --> 00:54:18,470
It's just a question

706
00:54:18,595 --> 00:54:23,058
Of when

707
00:54:23,183 --> 00:54:29,856
When I get a yen

708
00:54:30,023 --> 00:54:36,613
Then, baby, amen

709
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:44,829
I'm counting to ten

710
00:54:47,499 --> 00:54:51,252
I'm gonna love you
like nothin' you've known

711
00:54:54,005 --> 00:54:59,552
I'm gonna love you
and you all alone

712
00:55:01,054 --> 00:55:03,348
Sooner is better than later

713
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:06,476
But, lover

714
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,312
I'll hover

715
00:55:09,437 --> 00:55:14,442
I'll plan

716
00:55:14,567 --> 00:55:16,736
This time I'm not only getting

717
00:55:16,903 --> 00:55:18,988
I'm holding

718
00:55:19,114 --> 00:55:22,117
My

719
00:55:22,242 --> 00:55:27,330
Man

720
00:55:32,002 --> 00:55:36,256
Tracy! Tracy! Tracy! Tracy!

721
00:55:36,381 --> 00:55:38,258
Everywhere I turn...

722
00:55:38,383 --> 00:55:41,761
it's Tracy, Tracy, Tracy!

723
00:55:41,886 --> 00:55:43,763
It's like he's readin' my mind.

724
00:55:43,888 --> 00:55:48,643
Texie Garcia, Ribs Mocca, Johnny Ramm
and now de Santo-- I don't get it.

725
00:55:48,768 --> 00:55:53,898
How could he catch 'em so fast?
I don't understand. He knows
what we're doin' before we do it!

726
00:55:54,024 --> 00:56:00,530
You said you had a way of taking care
of Tracy. "Leave it to me," you said.
Well, let me tell you somethin'.

727
00:56:00,697 --> 00:56:05,118
I'm takin' this bum out of
the headlines. I'm rubbin' him out.

728
00:56:05,243 --> 00:56:09,622
You kill Tracy,
they point the finger at me. This bum--

729
00:56:20,884 --> 00:56:24,179
Hold it, hold it.

730
00:56:36,149 --> 00:56:39,152
We're bein' bugged.
We're bein' bugged.

731
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:45,950
We're bein' bugged. We're be--
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

732
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:55,335
Hey, Mike, what'd you put in this chili,
melted rubber?

733
00:56:55,502 --> 00:57:00,674
Sometimes I wonder why I slave
over a hot stove for you, Tracy.

734
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,093
Okay, Freddy.

735
00:57:03,218 --> 00:57:06,680
Get down to the Southside Warehouse.
Big pay-off.

736
00:57:21,111 --> 00:57:23,488
Tracy, I'm-- I'm leavin'.

737
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,079
I used to be afraid that maybe you'd
never take some time and settle down...

738
00:57:31,162 --> 00:57:33,665
and now I know it.

739
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,795
- I knew you'd never
want a desk job, Tracy.
- Calling Dick Tracy.

740
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,798
Calling Dick Tracy.
Do you read me, Tracy?

741
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:44,509
You got Big Boy on the run now,
and that's good.

742
00:57:44,634 --> 00:57:48,013
Calling Dick Tracy.
Calling Dick Tracy.

743
00:57:48,138 --> 00:57:52,767
Tracy, good luck.

744
00:57:52,892 --> 00:57:56,896
Come in, Tracy.
This is Bug Bailey. Do you read me?

745
00:57:57,022 --> 00:58:00,358
- What is it, Bug?
- There's somethin' goin' on
at the Southside Warehouse.

746
00:58:00,483 --> 00:58:02,694
It sounds big. Really big.

747
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:05,572
Go on.

748
00:58:07,782 --> 00:58:10,618
Tracy, come in.

749
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:13,747
- Go on.
- Tracy, are you there?

750
00:58:16,249 --> 00:58:19,252
- You better get over there, Tracy.
- I'm on my way.

751
00:58:26,593 --> 00:58:29,512
I'll be back, Tess.

752
00:59:44,713 --> 00:59:46,589
Reload.

753
01:00:01,229 --> 01:00:05,900
All right! All right, that's enough!
I want 'em dead, both of them.

754
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:08,820
I want this No-Face dead,
and I want Tracy dead.

755
01:00:08,945 --> 01:00:11,448
What's the matter? You bums
forgot how to kill people?

756
01:00:11,573 --> 01:00:13,825
Doesn't your work
mean anything to you any more?

757
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:16,703
Have you no sense of pride
in what you do?

758
01:00:16,828 --> 01:00:20,290
No sense of duty?
No sense of destiny?

759
01:00:20,415 --> 01:00:24,794
I'm lookin' for generals!
What do I got? Foot soldiers.

760
01:00:24,919 --> 01:00:27,839
I want Dick Tracy dead!

761
01:00:30,467 --> 01:00:34,971
Don't get me wrong, Tracy.
If you say there was a man with no face,
I'll bet the mortgage there was.

762
01:00:35,096 --> 01:00:37,140
- But who is he workin' for?
- Yeah, who's he workin' for?

763
01:00:37,265 --> 01:00:42,145
I don't know, boys, but I didn't dream
him up. Would you get my suit cleaned?
We need a witness who will testify.

764
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,857
- A man with no face?
- A man with no face.

765
01:00:45,982 --> 01:00:48,318
What can you lose, Big Boy?
What can you lose?

766
01:00:48,443 --> 01:00:51,738
I don't know, Big Boy.
It seems they want to get rid
of the Tracy problem as much as you.

767
01:00:51,905 --> 01:00:54,199
And it'll only cost you ten percent.
What can you lose?

768
01:00:54,324 --> 01:00:57,744
Okay, piano player.
You got a deal.

769
01:01:01,081 --> 01:01:04,042
Mike, give the Kid a doughnut.

770
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:07,003
- Hi, Tracy.
- Hi, Tracy.
- Hi, Tracy.

771
01:01:07,128 --> 01:01:10,006
- Which one?
- Where's Tess?
- She's out of town.

772
01:01:10,173 --> 01:01:13,009
- She asked me if the boys
could take care of the Kid till...
- Jelly.

773
01:01:13,134 --> 01:01:15,595
- they take him to the orphanage.
- There's no jelly in that doughnut.

774
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,140
- Okay.
- Tess went out of town, huh?
- Sorry, Tracy. I thought you knew.

775
01:01:19,474 --> 01:01:22,686
Want me to take the Kid
back to the precinct?

776
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:26,606
-No, Chief. Thanks a lot for fillin' in.
-Okay. Good night.

777
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:31,361
- What can you lose
- Good night.

778
01:01:31,528 --> 01:01:35,281
- Caught with the blues
- Tracy. Want a doughnut?

779
01:01:35,448 --> 01:01:38,743
- Uh, yeah. Thanks.
Mike, let me have a coffee, will ya?
- Now keep concealing

780
01:01:38,868 --> 01:01:40,912
- Everything you're feeling
- Coffee?

781
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:42,789
- Sayin' to ya
- And one for me too.

782
01:01:42,914 --> 01:01:46,334
What can you lose

783
01:01:46,459 --> 01:01:49,004
Maybe it shows

784
01:01:49,129 --> 01:01:51,506
She's had clues

785
01:01:51,631 --> 01:01:55,885
Which she chose to ignore

786
01:01:56,052 --> 01:01:58,304
Maybe, though, she knows

787
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:04,019
And just wants to go on
as before

788
01:02:04,185 --> 01:02:09,024
As a friend, nothin' more

789
01:02:09,149 --> 01:02:12,944
So she closes the door

790
01:02:14,779 --> 01:02:19,534
Well, if she does

791
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:24,289
Those are the dues

792
01:02:24,414 --> 01:02:28,793
Once the words are spoken
something may be broken

793
01:02:28,918 --> 01:02:31,504
Still you love her

794
01:02:31,671 --> 01:02:35,175
What can you lose

795
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,345
But what if she goes

796
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:42,515
At least now
you have part of her

797
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,479
What if she had to choose

798
01:02:47,604 --> 01:02:52,067
Leave it alone

799
01:02:52,192 --> 01:02:55,779
Hold it all in

800
01:02:56,988 --> 01:02:58,823
Let her alone

801
01:02:58,948 --> 01:03:01,326
Don't even begin

802
01:03:01,451 --> 01:03:05,997
With so much to win

803
01:03:07,957 --> 01:03:10,627
There's too much

804
01:03:10,752 --> 01:03:16,424
To lose

805
01:03:21,137 --> 01:03:23,181
Cheer up, Tracy.
I'm the one in danger.

806
01:03:23,306 --> 01:03:25,266
I shouldn't be talking to a cop.

807
01:03:25,433 --> 01:03:28,228
- You know what I want.
- I want to hear you say it.

808
01:03:28,353 --> 01:03:30,480
- Well, I don't want you to be hurt.
- Don't tell me what you don't want.

809
01:03:30,605 --> 01:03:33,608
Tell me what you do want.

810
01:03:35,568 --> 01:03:38,655
You want me.

811
01:03:40,365 --> 01:03:42,492
Don't you?

812
01:03:42,617 --> 01:03:45,161
You're right. I do want you,
in court where you can tell the truth--

813
01:03:45,286 --> 01:03:48,790
You're lying. You want me
the same way that I want you.

814
01:03:48,915 --> 01:03:51,334
You want me to take a risk?
I want you to take a risk.

815
01:03:51,459 --> 01:03:53,086
I told you I'd protect you
if you testified.

816
01:03:53,211 --> 01:03:56,047
- Protect me? You ca--
- It's my job.
- I don't know about your job.

817
01:03:56,172 --> 01:03:58,049
I only know what I feel.

818
01:03:58,216 --> 01:04:00,635
If you can't tell me how you feel,
Tracy, then I can't trust you.

819
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,139
Wait a minute.
What do you want me to admit?

820
01:04:04,305 --> 01:04:06,599
That I think about you?

821
01:04:06,725 --> 01:04:09,519
Okay, I admit it. Testify.

822
01:04:09,644 --> 01:04:13,898
You want my testimony?
Tell me you want me.

823
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:18,820
If you do that, I'll do anything
you say. How bad do you want Big Boy?

824
01:04:18,945 --> 01:04:22,741
It's up to you.
Tell me you want me.

825
01:04:22,866 --> 01:04:26,578
Tell me you want it all,
but tell me now.

826
01:04:33,376 --> 01:04:37,255
If I say that, I'm gonna hurt
somebody I don't want to hurt.

827
01:04:44,304 --> 01:04:46,473
You trust her.

828
01:04:51,603 --> 01:04:53,396
I love her.

829
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,830
He could be president
of the United States...

830
01:05:10,955 --> 01:05:13,083
and he'd call it a desk job.

831
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,877
Dick Tracy's awfully tough on himself.

832
01:05:16,002 --> 01:05:20,048
He's torn, Tess.
He's torn between love and duty.

833
01:05:20,173 --> 01:05:23,635
If you get too close to a man like that,
you probably won't be treated...

834
01:05:23,802 --> 01:05:26,096
much better than he treats himself.

835
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:30,225
It takes a lot of understanding
to love a man like that.

836
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:32,435
What did you say, Mother?

837
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,855
I said, "It takes a lot of
understanding to love a man like that."

838
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:46,574
He'll never take a desk job.

839
01:05:48,326 --> 01:05:51,413
This--

840
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:55,125
Yeah?

841
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:57,168
Sit down, will you.

842
01:05:57,335 --> 01:06:00,255
Sam, Mrs Trueheart said
Tess left there a long time ago.

843
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:02,465
Has somebody checked
Route Three for accidents?

844
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:04,217
Right, Tracy.

845
01:06:04,342 --> 01:06:06,720
We gotta talk about
this orphanage business.

846
01:06:06,845 --> 01:06:08,763
- Who wants--
- Tracy, did you get the sketch?

847
01:06:08,888 --> 01:06:11,391
Yes, I got the sketch. I got both
sketches. They're both the same sketch.

848
01:06:11,558 --> 01:06:14,394
Forget the sketch!
Check Route Three for accidents!

849
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:17,439
- We're working on it, Tracy.
- Don't work on it, do it!

850
01:06:17,564 --> 01:06:20,066
- Right.
- Right.

851
01:06:20,191 --> 01:06:23,528
I sure hope she comes back to him.
I've never seen him like this.

852
01:06:23,695 --> 01:06:26,364
The welfare office called again.

853
01:06:26,489 --> 01:06:28,950
I'm not supposed to keep you
out of the orphanage.

854
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:03,234
Yes, and then send the letter
to District Attorney Fletcher.

855
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,695
- Can you do it?
- Oh!

856
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,698
- I can do anyone's handwriting.
- All right. Tracy's handwriting.

857
01:07:08,823 --> 01:07:12,786
Write this: "District Attorney Fletcher,
I have evidence that will destroy you.

858
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:16,748
Bring $10,000
to room 429, Midway Hotel."

859
01:07:16,873 --> 01:07:18,625
Bring $10,000...

860
01:07:18,792 --> 01:07:22,837
to room 429, Midway Hotel.

861
01:08:02,836 --> 01:08:07,048
If you want to stay alive,
you'll do what Big Boy says.

862
01:08:09,426 --> 01:08:12,595
That's not it! That's not it!
Does Paddy O'Brien know she's missing?

863
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:14,472
- Yeah.
- Was he the one?
- That's not him.

864
01:08:14,597 --> 01:08:17,600
- That's not it! That's not it!
That's n-- What's that?
- It's for you.

865
01:08:17,767 --> 01:08:20,770
-Open it.
-Pat, what about that guy from up north?

866
01:08:20,895 --> 01:08:22,939
You hear anything about him?
What's his name? Louie.

867
01:08:23,064 --> 01:08:25,608
- Oh, yeah, Louie-- Louie the Louse.
- Yeah. Where is he?

868
01:08:25,775 --> 01:08:28,486
- Nah, he's in the pen, I think.
- How long?
- I can't do it, Kid. It's the law.

869
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:31,656
- Six months.
- Flowers.

870
01:08:31,781 --> 01:08:36,286
This is cold! Hey, who's on the coffee
out there? Rip van Winkle?

871
01:08:36,411 --> 01:08:39,789
-You can't even get a decent cup o--
-I don't know why it'd be cold. I mean--

872
01:08:44,586 --> 01:08:48,548
- Tess wants to talk.
Watch the Kid, boys.
- Sure thing, Tracy.

873
01:08:48,673 --> 01:08:51,634
Tracy, you got lilies. You want me
to put 'em in some water? Tracy!

874
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,012
Tracy!

875
01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:15,408
I'm here to pick up a child,
case 38196.

876
01:09:15,533 --> 01:09:18,620
I don't want to wait.
I want the child now.

877
01:09:18,745 --> 01:09:21,289
You're from the orphanage, ma'am?

878
01:09:21,414 --> 01:09:24,834
Last night we had a date
We stayed out late

879
01:09:24,959 --> 01:09:27,879
I bought round after round

880
01:09:28,004 --> 01:09:30,507
And just for you I played the fool

881
01:09:30,632 --> 01:09:32,801
Yes, I was quite the clown

882
01:09:32,926 --> 01:09:36,304
- Tess, where are you?
- Words were spoken, hearts were broken

883
01:09:36,429 --> 01:09:38,515
But now I hope you'll see

884
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,894
It was the whisky talkin', not me

885
01:09:44,771 --> 01:09:47,315
I had myself a little flask

886
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:58,535
Tess?

887
01:10:01,705 --> 01:10:05,041
Tess! Tess?

888
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:07,544
Relax, Tracy.

889
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:10,880
Just smell the flowers,
and go to sleep.

890
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:14,592
It won't kill you.
It won't even hurt you.

891
01:10:14,718 --> 01:10:17,971
But your big career is over.

892
01:10:39,534 --> 01:10:43,496
Hey! Close the darn door.

893
01:10:49,794 --> 01:10:51,963
- One figure so d--
- Tracy, you're late.

894
01:10:52,088 --> 01:10:55,050
Wait a minute. Who are you?

895
01:10:58,094 --> 01:11:00,847
Mayor Tracy, Senator Tracy,
Governor Tracy.

896
01:11:00,972 --> 01:11:04,434
High political offices
are being coupled with Tracy's name.

897
01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:07,187
Surely, of all--

898
01:11:21,326 --> 01:11:23,745
- Now?
- Now.

899
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,540
You can't blackmail me, Dick Tracy!

900
01:11:27,665 --> 01:11:31,086
Nobody does that to me!
Nobody blackmails me!

901
01:11:31,211 --> 01:11:34,422
You put that gun away! Who do you
think you're dealing with, huh?

902
01:11:34,547 --> 01:11:37,967
If I go to jail, you go to jail!
I don't have to pay you!

903
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:42,222
I don't have to give you a dime!
I don't have to give you a nickel,
Dick Tracy!

904
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:45,016
You're nothin' but a punk!
Tracy, that's all you are!

905
01:11:45,141 --> 01:11:48,395
- You're a punk!
Ain't nothin' but a street punk!
- Police? Better send someone

906
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,732
- The Midway Hotel.
- Put it away! Put it away!
Put the gun away, Tracy!

907
01:11:55,318 --> 01:11:57,987
...news as hot air and speculation.

908
01:11:59,364 --> 01:12:01,408
Out!

909
01:12:03,284 --> 01:12:05,995
Go around back!

910
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:23,722
Ah, yes, there's bad news tonight.
It's worse than bad. It's heartbreaking.

911
01:12:23,847 --> 01:12:25,765
Dick Tracy is in disgrace tonight.

912
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:28,476
Charges of blackmail and murder
fill the hushed air.

913
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:31,896
And in the void, once more, is heard
the rattle of chips as the wheel spins--

914
01:12:32,022 --> 01:12:36,192
This is beautiful.
I want to hang this on my wall.

915
01:12:36,317 --> 01:12:39,988
I've gotta hand it to ya, 88!
Your people did it.

916
01:12:40,113 --> 01:12:44,117
They got Tracy out of the way.
Keep him out of the way.

917
01:12:44,242 --> 01:12:46,953
Boys, we're back in business!

918
01:12:47,078 --> 01:12:49,456
Maybe I'll run for mayor myself.

919
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:58,923
Yesterday it seemed the world
was about to end, didn't it

920
01:12:59,049 --> 01:13:02,344
Looked as though we
wouldn't last out the year

921
01:13:02,469 --> 01:13:05,805
Yesterday, disaster
waited around the bend

922
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:09,309
Well, my friend, spring is here

923
01:13:09,434 --> 01:13:12,812
Back in business
and ain't it grand

924
01:13:12,937 --> 01:13:16,566
Let the good times roll

925
01:13:16,691 --> 01:13:19,861
Yesterday things were out of hand

926
01:13:19,986 --> 01:13:23,615
Now they're under control

927
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:27,160
Bye-bye, blues
So long, adversity

928
01:13:27,285 --> 01:13:31,122
Happiness, hello, hello, hello

929
01:13:31,247 --> 01:13:34,167
Keep the status quo

930
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:37,754
Permanently so

931
01:13:37,879 --> 01:13:41,549
Back again like a boomerang

932
01:13:41,716 --> 01:13:45,220
Same old stand, same old gang

933
01:13:45,345 --> 01:13:48,473
Back in business with a bang

934
01:13:48,598 --> 01:13:53,061
Let the good times roll

935
01:13:54,354 --> 01:13:57,691
Back in business, and ain't it grand

936
01:13:57,857 --> 01:14:01,361
Let the good times roll

937
01:14:01,486 --> 01:14:04,823
Back to normal, back to usual

938
01:14:04,948 --> 01:14:08,576
Let the fun resume

939
01:14:08,702 --> 01:14:12,080
No more doom and gloom

940
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:15,625
No more bust, just boom

941
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:19,254
Back in business, and overnight

942
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:22,799
In demand
Well, all right

943
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:26,428
Business is just dynamite

944
01:14:26,553 --> 01:14:29,889
Let the good times roll

945
01:14:34,144 --> 01:14:36,730
Tracy didn't do it, Chief.
I know he didn't do it.

946
01:14:36,855 --> 01:14:38,732
Well, you did the right thing
to call me, Kid.

947
01:14:38,857 --> 01:14:40,859
Tracy's in real bad shape about Tess.

948
01:14:40,984 --> 01:14:42,861
She's still missing,
and we haven't a clue.

949
01:14:42,986 --> 01:14:45,071
It looks like a kidnapping,
but nobody's asked for a ransom.

950
01:14:45,196 --> 01:14:48,616
- Tracy's the only one who can find her.
- Judge said, "No bail."

951
01:14:48,742 --> 01:14:52,579
He didn't do it, Chief.
He didn't do it.

952
01:14:52,746 --> 01:14:56,666
Why would somebody kidnap Tess
and not even ask for a ransom?

953
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:58,710
If I can just get back
on that street--

954
01:14:58,835 --> 01:15:04,049
I'll leave you two alone for a minute.
It'll be anytime now.

955
01:15:04,215 --> 01:15:10,263
The state police will be comin'
to transfer you from the city jail
to the county jail in a little while.

956
01:15:11,598 --> 01:15:13,641
How's the food?

957
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:17,062
Good.

958
01:15:17,187 --> 01:15:21,566
- How's the food at the orphanage?
- It's good.

959
01:15:21,691 --> 01:15:24,235
- It'll be anytime now.
- All right, Chief.

960
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:26,196
What a New Year's Eve, huh?

961
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,910
I got my permanent certificate.

962
01:15:32,035 --> 01:15:35,080
But I thought you-- I thought
you had to pick a name, didn't--

963
01:15:35,205 --> 01:15:37,624
- I did.
- But--

964
01:15:50,303 --> 01:15:53,348
If it's all right with you.

965
01:16:04,109 --> 01:16:06,695
It's all right with me.

966
01:16:10,657 --> 01:16:12,992
It is.

967
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:17,205
Tess, I hope you like...

968
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:19,833
being alone with me.

969
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:22,335
Happy New Year.

970
01:16:25,839 --> 01:16:28,216
- Here. Let me get that.
- Okay. It's okay.

971
01:16:28,341 --> 01:16:32,178
- Sorry, Tracy.
- Happy New Year, Tracy.
- Happy New Year, Tracy.

972
01:16:32,303 --> 01:16:34,889
- What are you two doing here?
- It's a long trip to county jail.

973
01:16:35,015 --> 01:16:39,728
I'd say it would take
at least eight hours to get there.

974
01:16:39,894 --> 01:16:43,148
All right, boys. Call headquarters. Get
'em to send a car to 38th and Central.

975
01:16:43,273 --> 01:16:46,901
And tell 'em there's something
I want 'em to bring.

976
01:16:50,655 --> 01:16:53,158
Hello, Mumbles! Who set me up, huh?

977
01:16:53,283 --> 01:16:54,826
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Look!
- I'm looking at you.

978
01:16:54,951 --> 01:16:59,497
Talk, you cockroach! Talk! Huh? Huh?

979
01:16:59,622 --> 01:17:01,791
Okay, Pat.

980
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,212
Look.

981
01:17:06,379 --> 01:17:09,215
Care for some water, Mumbles, huh?

982
01:17:09,299 --> 01:17:11,593
This is Brandon speaking.
Who's calling?

983
01:17:11,718 --> 01:17:14,721
Do you want to put Big Boy in jail?

984
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:19,309
- Yes?
- He's kidnapped Tess Trueheart.

985
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,436
- Go to 38th and Grand.
- Now, wait a minute.

986
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:24,314
- Who is this?
- Wait for a call.
- Hello? Hello--

987
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:31,363
38th and Grand.
That's the Club Ritz.

988
01:17:31,488 --> 01:17:33,990
- Joe!
- Yes, sir?
- Get my car.

989
01:17:34,115 --> 01:17:38,286
-Keep an eye on the kid till I get back.
-Right, Chief.

990
01:17:38,411 --> 01:17:42,999
You don't want to tell me
who set me up, huh?

991
01:17:43,124 --> 01:17:45,877
You want Big Boy to hear that?

992
01:17:59,432 --> 01:18:02,185
What do you think, Mumbles?

993
01:18:05,563 --> 01:18:07,691
Big Boy did it.
Big Boy did it.

994
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,943
Big Boy did it.
Big Boy did it.

995
01:18:21,788 --> 01:18:23,581
I'm innocent. I'm innocent.

996
01:18:23,707 --> 01:18:27,043
Okay, Sam, let's take this
and play it for Big Boy.

997
01:18:27,168 --> 01:18:30,463
Uh, wait. Wait a minute.
Uh, uh, uh, wait.

998
01:18:31,881 --> 01:18:35,552
88 Keys, the piano man, set you up.

999
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:38,805
Big Boy paid him
to get you out of the way.

1000
01:18:38,972 --> 01:18:43,727
Why would somebody kidnap Tess
and not even ask for a ransom?

1001
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:46,938
So what do we do? Grab 88 Keys
or go straight for Big Boy?

1002
01:18:47,105 --> 01:18:49,816
Yeah, Tracy, what do we do?
Grab 88 Keys or go straight for Big Boy?

1003
01:18:49,941 --> 01:18:54,779
Is the enemy of my enemy my friend,
or the enemy of my friend my enemy?

1004
01:18:54,904 --> 01:18:58,158
- What?
- Or the enemy of my enemy my enemy?

1005
01:18:58,241 --> 01:19:01,786
- What did he say?
- The enemy of my enemy is my enemy.

1006
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:05,457
He said the enemy
of his enemy is his enemy.

1007
01:19:05,582 --> 01:19:07,959
Oh.

1008
01:19:10,295 --> 01:19:12,964
Caprice speaking. Who is this?

1009
01:19:13,089 --> 01:19:16,885
How long since you took a look
in your attic, Big Boy?

1010
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,970
Who is this?

1011
01:19:21,014 --> 01:19:23,558
Better take a look around upstairs.
Something's fishy.

1012
01:19:25,018 --> 01:19:27,062
Okay, Sam, you take the front.

1013
01:19:27,187 --> 01:19:30,607
- We're going to the roof.
- Tracy, why are we going to the roof?

1014
01:19:30,774 --> 01:19:34,152
I don't know.
It seems like a good place to hide.

1015
01:19:34,277 --> 01:19:37,530
Can you get through
to Chief Brandon?

1016
01:19:37,655 --> 01:19:41,076
Big Boy, I think you ought
with come with me, quick.

1017
01:19:46,331 --> 01:19:48,875
Tracy, why are we going to the roof?

1018
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:57,842
This is Chief Brandon.

1019
01:20:21,574 --> 01:20:23,493
Jumpin' Jiminy, Tracy.
That's Tess!

1020
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:26,413
- Break that lock.
- Okay, Tracy. Okay. Lemme just--

1021
01:20:29,332 --> 01:20:31,668
- What's she doing here?
- It won't budge, Tracy.

1022
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:33,670
- What is this?
- It's Tracy's dame!

1023
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:36,923
- What's she doin' here?
How'd she-- How'd she get in here?
- Tracy!

1024
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:40,135
Untie her! Come on! We gotta
get outta here! Untie her. Let's go!

1025
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,220
- Get her outta here!
- Don't shoot.

1026
01:20:42,345 --> 01:20:45,015
It's a frame--
It's a frame-up!

1027
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,642
Somebody tried to make it look
like we kidnapped her!

1028
01:20:47,767 --> 01:20:50,061
It's a federal offence!
Come on! Come on!

1029
01:20:53,231 --> 01:20:56,067
- I'm okay, Tracy!
- That's kidnapping, Big Boy!

1030
01:20:56,192 --> 01:20:58,862
It's a federal offence!

1031
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:01,614
Things are not always what they seem.
You're gonna pay for this.

1032
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:05,869
- Easy!
- Hey, anybody shoots,
I shoot you, Sweet Pea! Come on!

1033
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:08,747
Tracy, what's going on?
Did you hurt yourself?

1034
01:21:08,872 --> 01:21:11,332
I gotta figure
a way out of here, Pat.

1035
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:12,459
Tracy, are you okay?

1036
01:21:13,585 --> 01:21:16,004
Got my diamonds

1037
01:21:16,129 --> 01:21:18,423
Got my yacht

1038
01:21:18,548 --> 01:21:23,011
Got a guy I adore

1039
01:21:23,136 --> 01:21:27,599
I'm so happy with what I got

1040
01:21:27,724 --> 01:21:31,144
I want more

1041
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:33,313
No way out of this place.

1042
01:21:33,438 --> 01:21:36,232
You can't find a trapdoor
or a panel that moves or something?

1043
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:39,527
I'm looking, Pat.
The ceiling must be 20 feet high.

1044
01:21:46,242 --> 01:21:49,579
Mathematician

1045
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:52,832
All I know is addition

1046
01:21:52,957 --> 01:21:56,378
What are you doing down there?

1047
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:58,755
Tracy, what are you doing down there?

1048
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:06,471
Hey, boss,
why are we surrounded by cops?

1049
01:22:06,638 --> 01:22:10,475
- Cops?
- A billion of 'em!
- This is it! Burn the records!

1050
01:22:10,642 --> 01:22:12,602
Lock all the doors!
This is your fault.

1051
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:15,647
They're forcing me to use you
as a hostage. Break out the guns!

1052
01:22:15,772 --> 01:22:18,650
Geez, boss. Tracy-- Tracy's girl?

1053
01:22:18,775 --> 01:22:21,653
Someone set us up. They're gonna
get us on a kidnapping rap.

1054
01:22:21,778 --> 01:22:25,323
- Gimme a tommy.
- All of us! We gotta get outta here.
- Get outta my way.

1055
01:22:25,448 --> 01:22:28,535
- Get outta my way!
- I like Tracy.

1056
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,745
- I had a meeting with him once.
Did he tell you?
- Come on, you.

1057
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:34,249
- Let me tell you. I may just
put a bullet through your head.
- Let's go!

1058
01:22:34,374 --> 01:22:38,795
- What do you weigh, Pat?
- I don't know. About 195, 196,
something like that.

1059
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,715
- How much?
- Two-ten.

1060
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,927
I find counting a bore

1061
01:22:46,052 --> 01:22:48,763
Keep the number mounting
Your accountant does the counting

1062
01:22:48,888 --> 01:22:52,976
More, more

1063
01:22:55,854 --> 01:22:59,733
The only way to get into this joint,
Chief, is to bust our way in.

1064
01:22:59,858 --> 01:23:01,693
- Jump.
- What?

1065
01:23:01,818 --> 01:23:03,903
- Jump.
- Jump?

1066
01:23:04,029 --> 01:23:05,989
- Music too
- Keep your mouth shut, woman!

1067
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,657
- You don't say nothing to nobody.
- Just as much

1068
01:23:07,824 --> 01:23:10,744
- You may think they got us surrounded,
- As before
- but I'm gettin' out of this.

1069
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:14,998
- I've got my guy and my sky of blue
- Watch it. Move it, woman!

1070
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:19,127
Now, however, I own the view

1071
01:23:19,252 --> 01:23:22,088
Come on. Just jump.

1072
01:23:26,885 --> 01:23:29,387
All right. This is it.

1073
01:23:29,512 --> 01:23:31,890
Come out with your hands
over your head.

1074
01:23:32,057 --> 01:23:34,809
Them coppers are never gonna take me
alive. We're making a break for it.

1075
01:23:34,934 --> 01:23:37,562
Come out with your hands
over your heads.

1076
01:23:37,687 --> 01:23:41,191
This is it. The jig is up!

1077
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:43,318
One is fun, why not two

1078
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:45,653
And if you like two
you might as well have four

1079
01:23:45,779 --> 01:23:47,947
And if you like four
why not a few

1080
01:23:48,073 --> 01:23:51,451
Why not a slew more

1081
01:23:51,618 --> 01:23:54,788
Come on, let's go!
ln the car! ln the car! Now!

1082
01:23:54,913 --> 01:23:59,042
Listen, you guys. When I hit
my horn, that's the signal to go.

1083
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,753
Okay, Big Boy.
Let's give it to 'em, boys!

1084
01:24:01,878 --> 01:24:04,631
You gotta tell 'em everything.
They crave leadership.

1085
01:24:04,756 --> 01:24:07,384
- You're under arrest.
- Chief.
- If you--

1086
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:10,762
- Look at him. What's he doing up there?
- Tracy!

1087
01:24:20,605 --> 01:24:23,024
If you've got a little
why not a lot

1088
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:24,984
Add a bit and it'll
get to be an oodle

1089
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:27,570
Every jot and tittle
adds to the pot

1090
01:24:27,696 --> 01:24:30,615
Soon you got the kit
as well as the caboodle, more

1091
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:34,077
He does have Tess, but he won't
bring her outta there. We gotta go in.

1092
01:24:34,244 --> 01:24:36,913
- Go in?
- Give me that tommy gun, Sam.

1093
01:24:41,334 --> 01:24:43,211
Okay, hit your horn.

1094
01:24:43,336 --> 01:24:46,089
You bring your men--

1095
01:24:51,094 --> 01:24:53,471
Never settle for something less

1096
01:24:53,596 --> 01:24:56,975
Something's better than nothing, yes

1097
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:31,676
This may get messy. You make a wrong
move inside here, I blow your head off.

1098
01:25:31,801 --> 01:25:34,220
Big Boy!

1099
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,104
Come on! Get outta there!

1100
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:07,420
You know, sometimes I wonder
why I try to improve things.

1101
01:26:07,545 --> 01:26:10,423
Nobody seems to care.

1102
01:26:12,008 --> 01:26:15,470
Pain can be valuable, Miss Trueheart.
We learn from pain.

1103
01:26:15,595 --> 01:26:18,139
We learn from--
Don't make me push you!

1104
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:24,562
This is awkward.
This is so awkward. Here.

1105
01:26:24,688 --> 01:26:27,982
Let's go, men. Big Boy's inside.
He's got Tess with him.

1106
01:26:28,108 --> 01:26:30,735
- I knew he wouldn't have
the guts to come out.
- Right, Tracy.

1107
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:34,197
They say I kidnapped you.
I didn't kidnap you.

1108
01:26:34,364 --> 01:26:36,199
But I'm kidnapping you now.

1109
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,368
- Ah, does life imitate art?
- Hey, Mr Caprice.

1110
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,787
- So many questions, so few answers.
- Mr Caprice.

1111
01:26:40,912 --> 01:26:43,915
What a way to usher in the new year.

1112
01:26:49,295 --> 01:26:52,257
He took her through there.
The wine room.

1113
01:26:56,678 --> 01:27:00,890
Tracy, you don't trust me.

1114
01:27:06,146 --> 01:27:08,898
Tracy?

1115
01:27:11,151 --> 01:27:13,236
Good luck.

1116
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:18,658
Thanks.

1117
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:33,840
It was very stupid of you
to have been lured into this scheme.

1118
01:27:33,965 --> 01:27:36,092
A big mistake.

1119
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:38,553
Get 'em up, please.

1120
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:44,059
It's not so much that I have to hurt
someone. It's just don't make me do it!

1121
01:27:50,815 --> 01:27:53,234
- Ah, ya louse!
- Come over here.

1122
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:57,197
Believe me, this is not
the way I wanted it to be.

1123
01:28:22,222 --> 01:28:25,058
There it is! The city!
They'll never find me!

1124
01:28:25,183 --> 01:28:29,062
Can you hear its beat?
Oh, the rhythm! Happy New Year, city!

1125
01:28:36,986 --> 01:28:40,365
Jump! We can make it!
No! No, don't jump! We can't make it.

1126
01:28:51,084 --> 01:28:54,254
You'll pay for this.
You're gonna pay for this.

1127
01:29:16,985 --> 01:29:20,530
Don't move!
Not if you want to stay alive.

1128
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:23,408
A woman, a woman, a woman!

1129
01:29:23,575 --> 01:29:26,786
I've been humiliated by a woman.

1130
01:29:26,911 --> 01:29:29,414
The way I see it--
and Plato agrees with me--

1131
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:34,669
is that there is what is, and then
there is what we would like it to be.

1132
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:39,632
But that's not important.
What's important is the future;
it's planning ahead.

1133
01:29:39,758 --> 01:29:42,719
"A man without a plan
is not a man."

1134
01:29:42,802 --> 01:29:46,014
Nietzsche. Wait a minute.

1135
01:29:46,139 --> 01:29:49,434
Wait. I'm having a thought.

1136
01:29:49,559 --> 01:29:52,228
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

1137
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:55,023
I'm gonna have a thought.
It's coming.

1138
01:29:57,901 --> 01:30:00,487
It's gone.

1139
01:30:04,324 --> 01:30:06,242
We must rise above the tide...

1140
01:30:06,409 --> 01:30:09,996
take that journey, that journey
into that faraway land...

1141
01:30:10,121 --> 01:30:11,706
a land that just waits.

1142
01:30:11,831 --> 01:30:15,085
It waits by the track
where the train of destiny must run...

1143
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:19,214
run into the future,
breaking the shackles of the past.

1144
01:30:19,339 --> 01:30:23,009
Forget the past. Forget the past.
Our limitations are our shackles.

1145
01:30:23,134 --> 01:30:27,555
Put them behind you forever.
Put them behind you forever, Tess.

1146
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:33,603
Can't you see I love you?

1147
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:35,772
Wait! What's that?

1148
01:30:37,774 --> 01:30:41,277
Hands up, copper! We gotta talk.

1149
01:30:41,403 --> 01:30:44,197
I did not kidnap this woman.

1150
01:30:44,322 --> 01:30:47,367
Drop that gun, or my next bullet's
got her name on it!

1151
01:30:47,492 --> 01:30:51,496
- Don't do it, Dick!
- Good. Good, Tracy.

1152
01:30:53,331 --> 01:30:55,750
What's that? Tracy!

1153
01:30:57,919 --> 01:31:01,172
Tracy. Tracy? Where are ya?

1154
01:31:01,339 --> 01:31:03,466
Where'd ya go?

1155
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:06,052
What, are you playin' hide-and-seek?
You're hidin' from me?

1156
01:31:06,177 --> 01:31:09,264
That's not fair.
No way to be, Dick.

1157
01:31:09,431 --> 01:31:12,100
Come out, Tracy.
These gears are turnin'.

1158
01:31:12,225 --> 01:31:15,770
You want this dumb dame's head
to be smashed like a walnut?

1159
01:31:15,895 --> 01:31:20,483
Tracy, I did not kidnap this girl.
Somebody's trying to frame me.

1160
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:23,778
Where are you? Come on! Just let me
see ya. I just wanna see your face.

1161
01:31:23,903 --> 01:31:26,156
I just wanna-- I just wanna
talk some sense here. I wanna--

1162
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:28,616
I just wanna take your head,
and I wanna crack it like an egg!

1163
01:31:28,783 --> 01:31:33,788
No! No! I didn't mean that.
No, Tracy. Listen to me.

1164
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:36,541
Tracy, you hear that?
What's happening to that can...

1165
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:39,836
is going to be happening
to her head in a few seconds!

1166
01:31:40,003 --> 01:31:43,089
There's not going to be
any more beautiful hair to fondle, huh?

1167
01:31:43,214 --> 01:31:45,592
No, no ears to nuzzle.

1168
01:31:45,717 --> 01:31:49,012
You're gonna have
chopped sweetheart, Tracy.

1169
01:31:49,179 --> 01:31:52,724
There. See those gears?
Those gears are like a clock.

1170
01:31:52,849 --> 01:31:55,685
Every notch, ticktock--

1171
01:32:17,749 --> 01:32:20,001
Tracy!

1172
01:32:43,149 --> 01:32:45,402
Drop it, Big Boy!

1173
01:32:45,527 --> 01:32:48,613
Get your hands up, Tracy.
Don't move, either one of ya.

1174
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:55,078
I outsmarted ya, Big Boy.
I knew you'd panic.

1175
01:32:55,245 --> 01:33:00,125
I brought you down with kidnapping,
the only crime you didn't commit.

1176
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:04,129
Whoever you are,
I know we can make a deal.

1177
01:33:04,254 --> 01:33:07,924
A deal?
I'm making my deal with Tracy.

1178
01:33:08,049 --> 01:33:11,469
Tracy, with Big Boy out of the way,
we can own this town.

1179
01:33:11,553 --> 01:33:14,514
Pick up that pipe and kill him.

1180
01:33:17,976 --> 01:33:20,311
Pick it up!

1181
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:27,777
Pick up that pipe.

1182
01:33:29,362 --> 01:33:32,782
Tracy, no!

1183
01:33:37,829 --> 01:33:40,582
Drop the gun!

1184
01:33:51,968 --> 01:33:54,262
I'll do it, Kid!

1185
01:33:54,429 --> 01:33:58,016
Don't move your head, Tess. I got it.
It's okay. Don't turn your head.

1186
01:34:06,733 --> 01:34:08,318
Hey, Tracy, look.

1187
01:34:26,378 --> 01:34:28,755
Is he still alive?

1188
01:34:37,597 --> 01:34:41,393
Will you look at that.

1189
01:34:43,269 --> 01:34:45,897
Tess? Call an ambulance.

1190
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:55,073
I'll call, Tess. I'll go get it.

1191
01:35:02,247 --> 01:35:06,001
You were right, Tracy.
I couldn't pull the trigger.

1192
01:35:06,126 --> 01:35:08,545
It was a good plan, Breathless.
You almost pulled it off.

1193
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:13,883
- The city would've been yours.
- Yeah. You were my only mistake.

1194
01:35:14,009 --> 01:35:18,096
Tell me the truth. Could it ever
have happened between us?

1195
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,997
But that's how we got him to confess
that Breathless killed Fletcher.

1196
01:37:08,123 --> 01:37:10,917
- He was her piano player.
- Not bad.

1197
01:37:11,042 --> 01:37:15,005
Thanks. Mm-hmm. You know, you're
probably much too smart to need this...

1198
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:18,508
but I think I'm gonna
give it to you, anyway.

1199
01:37:21,136 --> 01:37:23,763
Gee!

1200
01:37:23,888 --> 01:37:27,058
Tracy! This-- Hey, it can-- W--

1201
01:37:27,225 --> 01:37:32,355
- Wow!
- It tastes different, Mike.
What'd you do, wash the bowl?

1202
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,357
Ah, don't listen to him, Mike.
It's just grand.

1203
01:37:34,482 --> 01:37:38,737
Except for the guy she goes out with,
this lady's got real taste.

1204
01:37:38,862 --> 01:37:41,406
- Tess?
- What?

1205
01:37:41,573 --> 01:37:43,533
I've been thinking.

1206
01:37:43,658 --> 01:37:47,871
- What about?
- Well, you livin' alone and--

1207
01:37:47,996 --> 01:37:51,166
Well, I like living alone.

1208
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:54,711
- Uh-huh.
- We have that in common, I guess.

1209
01:37:54,836 --> 01:37:58,256
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Well, don't we?

1210
01:38:00,467 --> 01:38:04,220
Well, I just think when two people
have so much in common...

1211
01:38:04,346 --> 01:38:07,057
they oughta do somethin' about it.

1212
01:38:12,854 --> 01:38:16,149
- Would--
- Uh-oh.

1213
01:38:16,274 --> 01:38:19,611
Shut up, kid. And--

1214
01:38:28,244 --> 01:38:31,122
Uh...

1215
01:38:31,247 --> 01:38:33,541
don't--

1216
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:35,877
Yes?

1217
01:38:36,002 --> 01:38:37,754
Uh--

1218
01:38:40,382 --> 01:38:44,302
Don't you think we'd be happier
if we just--

1219
01:38:44,427 --> 01:38:47,430
What?

1220
01:38:52,018 --> 01:38:54,896
- What do you think?
- Dick Tracy, are you asking me to--

1221
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:57,482
Calling Dick Tracy.
Pat Patton to Dick Tracy.

1222
01:38:57,607 --> 01:39:00,318
Robbery in progress, Tracy,
Metropolitan Bank.

1223
01:39:00,443 --> 01:39:03,947
Hot diggity dog!
Come on! Let's go!

1224
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:08,076
Come on, Tracy! Let's go! Come on!

1225
01:39:08,201 --> 01:39:10,537
- Come on, Tracy!
- Well, what are you waiting for?

1226
01:39:10,662 --> 01:39:13,915
A nice safe desk?

1227
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:22,424
Tess.

1228
01:39:26,344 --> 01:39:29,889
You're one in a million.

1229
01:39:38,648 --> 01:39:41,234
This is amazing, Tracy!
What are you waitin' for?

1230
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:44,529
Come on. Let's go!

1231
01:39:44,696 --> 01:39:48,158
Come on. Metropolitan Bank.
Come on. Step on it!

1232
01:39:50,452 --> 01:39:54,414
You know something, Tracy?
I kinda like that dame.

1233
01:40:30,367 --> 01:40:33,453
Once upon a time
I had plenty of nothin'

1234
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:37,290
Which was fine with me
because I had rhythm, music, love

1235
01:40:37,457 --> 01:40:39,417
The sun, the stars
and the moon above

1236
01:40:39,584 --> 01:40:44,547
Had the clear blue sky
and the deep blue sea

1237
01:40:44,673 --> 01:40:49,010
That was when the best things
in life were free

1238
01:40:49,135 --> 01:40:52,597
Then time went by and now
I get plenty of plenty

1239
01:40:52,722 --> 01:40:55,183
Which is fine with me
'cause I still got love

1240
01:40:55,308 --> 01:40:59,187
I still got rhythm, but look
at what I got to go with 'em

1241
01:41:00,605 --> 01:41:05,902
Who could ask for anything more
I hear you query

1242
01:41:06,027 --> 01:41:11,032
Who could ask for anything more
Well, let me tell you

1243
01:41:11,157 --> 01:41:14,035
Dearie

1244
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,207
Got my diamonds

1245
01:41:19,374 --> 01:41:21,543
Got my yacht

1246
01:41:21,668 --> 01:41:26,214
Got a guy I adore

1247
01:41:26,339 --> 01:41:30,677
I'm so happy with what I got

1248
01:41:30,802 --> 01:41:35,432
I want more

1249
01:41:35,557 --> 01:41:37,726
Count your blessings

1250
01:41:37,851 --> 01:41:39,936
One, two, three

1251
01:41:40,061 --> 01:41:44,524
I just hate keeping score

1252
01:41:44,649 --> 01:41:48,695
Any number is fine with me

1253
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:52,532
As long as it's more

1254
01:41:52,657 --> 01:41:56,077
As long as it's more

1255
01:41:56,202 --> 01:42:00,623
I'm no mathematician

1256
01:42:00,749 --> 01:42:05,211
All I know is addition

1257
01:42:05,337 --> 01:42:09,466
I find counting a bore

1258
01:42:09,591 --> 01:42:12,260
Keep the number mounting
Your accountant does the counting

1259
01:42:12,385 --> 01:42:14,637
More

1260
01:42:19,059 --> 01:42:21,186
I got rhythm

1261
01:42:21,353 --> 01:42:23,521
Music too

1262
01:42:23,646 --> 01:42:28,193
Just as much as before

1263
01:42:28,318 --> 01:42:32,781
Got my guy and my sky of blue

1264
01:42:32,906 --> 01:42:37,285
Now, however, I own the view

1265
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:41,206
More is better than nothing, true

1266
01:42:41,331 --> 01:42:46,169
But nothing's better than
more, more, more

1267
01:42:46,294 --> 01:42:51,549
- Nothing's better than more
- More

1268
01:42:53,259 --> 01:42:55,387
One is fun
Why not two

1269
01:42:55,512 --> 01:42:57,597
And if you like two
you might as well have four

1270
01:42:57,722 --> 01:42:59,849
And if you like four
why not a few

1271
01:43:00,016 --> 01:43:03,103
Why not a slew more

1272
01:43:03,186 --> 01:43:05,522
If you got a little
why not a lot

1273
01:43:05,647 --> 01:43:07,649
Add a bit and it'll
get to be an oodle

1274
01:43:07,774 --> 01:43:09,943
Every jot and tittle
adds to the pot

1275
01:43:10,068 --> 01:43:12,237
Soon you've got the kit
as well as the caboodle

1276
01:43:12,404 --> 01:43:14,364
More

1277
01:43:14,531 --> 01:43:16,658
More

1278
01:43:16,783 --> 01:43:18,993
Never say when
Never stop at plenty

1279
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:21,246
If it's gonna rain, let it pour

1280
01:43:21,371 --> 01:43:23,415
Happy with ten
Happier with twenty

1281
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:28,253
If you like a penny
wouldn't you like many much more

1282
01:43:28,378 --> 01:43:32,799
Or does that sound too greedy

1283
01:43:32,924 --> 01:43:37,303
That's not greed, no, indeedy

1284
01:43:37,429 --> 01:43:41,433
That's just stocking the store

1285
01:43:41,558 --> 01:43:44,144
Gotta fill your cupboard
Remember Mother Hubbard

1286
01:43:44,269 --> 01:43:46,438
More

1287
01:43:46,563 --> 01:43:48,732
More

1288
01:43:48,857 --> 01:43:53,194
Each possession you possess

1289
01:43:53,319 --> 01:43:57,782
Helps your spirits to soar

1290
01:43:57,907 --> 01:44:02,162
That's what's soothing about excess

1291
01:44:02,328 --> 01:44:06,166
Something's better than nothing, yes

1292
01:44:06,291 --> 01:44:11,046
But nothing's better than
more, more, more

1293
01:44:11,171 --> 01:44:13,381
Except all, all, all

1294
01:44:13,548 --> 01:44:16,593
Except once

1295
01:44:16,718 --> 01:44:20,096
You have it all

1296
01:44:20,221 --> 01:44:22,182
Have it all

1297
01:44:22,307 --> 01:44:27,354
You may find all else above

1298
01:44:27,479 --> 01:44:31,024
Else above

1299
01:44:31,149 --> 01:44:34,527
That though things

1300
01:44:34,652 --> 01:44:37,781
Are bliss

1301
01:44:37,947 --> 01:44:43,703
There's one thing you miss

1302
01:44:44,996 --> 01:44:48,333
And

1303
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:51,503
That's

1304
01:44:51,628 --> 01:44:53,797
More

1305
01:44:53,922 --> 01:44:56,049
More

1306
01:44:56,174 --> 01:44:58,843
More, more, more, more, more
