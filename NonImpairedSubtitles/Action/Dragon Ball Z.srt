1
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:37,030
Son Goku has broken Piccolo's dream of conquering the world.

2
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,840
Five years have passed very quickly.

3
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,990
Life has gone on peacefully.

4
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,780
But a new crisis is just around the corner.

5
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,210
My name is Gohan! The Mini Goku.

6
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,360
Gohan!

7
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,300
Gohan!

8
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,810
Gohan!

9
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,740
Gohan!

10
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,000
This tree finally becomes useful.

11
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,750
Gohan!

12
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,900
Welcome home. Goku, where's Gohan?

13
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,690
I'm starving.

14
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,150
What do you mean? Have you seen or heard from Gohan?

15
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,350
I haven't.

16
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,350
Then where has he gone to?

17
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,930
If we don't have our meal right away, you'll be late and Muten Roshi will be upset.

18
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,920
All right, let me go find him.

19
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,810
I don't think he'll be too far away.

20
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,000
Be back soon!

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,630
Thank you!

22
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,220
There's really nothing I can do about that kid.

23
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,990
I'm almost finished.

24
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,300
W-What was that?

25
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,340
Was that a meteorite or a UFO?

26
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,350
I'll go look.

27
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,200
It's not a meteorite. Then what is it?

28
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,920
So some people are still surviving on this planet...

29
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,240
That damned Kakarotto.

30
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,000
W-Who are you?

31
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,700
With a fighting level of 5, you're just trash.

32
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,760
Don't come near me!

33
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,760
I'll kill you!

34
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,550
What a weak and fragile race.

35
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,050
Someone with immense power...

36
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,780
A distance of 4880...

37
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,130
Is it Kakarotto?

38
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:45,760
Father... Father!

39
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,140
It's a butterfly!

40
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,640
Wait!

41
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,850
It's flown up so high.

42
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,250
Okay.

43
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,430
Pretend to die.

44
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,150
My hat!

45
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,540
My father gave me that!

46
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,790
Hey! GOHAN!

47
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,240
Father! Mother!

48
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,500
It's a bird!

49
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,360
It's so beautiful.

50
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm Son Gohan.

51
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,930
Wait...

52
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,900
Mother! Mother!

53
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,740
Hey...That hat.

54
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,970
That hat belongs to my son, Gohan.

55
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,820
Where did you get it?

56
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,370
Where did you get it?!

57
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,460
Father! Mother!

58
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,500
Gohan!

59
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,110
Gohan!

60
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,190
GOHAN!

61
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,450
It's Father!

62
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,800
Hold on, I'm coming to rescue you.

63
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,680
Gohan!

64
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,530
Almost there!

65
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,470
Father!

66
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,040
Gohan!!

67
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,570
Mother! Mother!

68
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,660
Mother!

69
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,190
Gohan!

70
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,610
Gohan!

71
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,750
I'm scared!

72
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,530
I'm scared! I can't get down!

73
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:58,580
Father! I was so scared!

74
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,980
Gohan, you...

75
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,470
I don't know...

76
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,500
Gohan, let's go home.

77
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,840
Your mom is worried.

78
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,170
And we have to go visit Grandpa Kamesennin.

79
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,400
Damn that Kakarotto.

80
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,030
What is that power?

81
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,720
It can't be Son Goku.

82
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,730
No!

83
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,990
So it's not Kakarotto.

84
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,450
Who are you?  What brought you to see me?

85
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,070
Nothing's brought me to see you.

86
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,070
Then why are you here?

87
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,870
You want to die?

88
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,350
Those are very strong words.

89
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,020
Fighting force of 322.

90
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,270
So there's someone like this here as well.

91
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,730
But you're still no match for me.

92
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,560
You bastard, do you know who you are talking to?!

93
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,240
How can this guy have such an immense power?

94
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,290
What a foolish attempt.

95
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,370
All you can do is stir up dust.

96
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,430
Now it's my turn. Shall I show you how it's done?

97
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,680
Another unbelievably strong energy force...

98
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,540
It's over there. Distance 12909.

99
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,260
It's big. The biggest power on this planet.

100
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,700
It must be Kakarotto.

101
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,730
I-Impossible...

102
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,380
I'm shivering so hard I can't even move...

103
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,470
Can't he see the honor in being aSaiyajin? The strongest beings in the entire universe!

104
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,040
Kakarotto!

105
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,550
The strongest beings in the entire universe, the Saiyajins. Who are they? And who is Kakarotto?

106
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,710
There seems to be some mysterious relationship between this warrior and Goku.

107
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:25,040
{\a6}Madoshi X

108
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:25,040
{\a5}DBZ #001

109
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:25,040
{\a7}AnimeHQ

110
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:35,300
Can we clear up the history of Goku?
