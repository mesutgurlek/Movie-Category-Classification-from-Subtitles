1
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:54,373
Captain wants you
to keep 500 feet.

2
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,803
Maneuvering, Control.
Come in shallow to 500 feet.

3
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,890
- Keep 500 feet.
- Keep 500 feet, sir.

4
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,975
What the hell's going on, Eddie?

5
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:38,809
Emergency stations.
Captain to the control room.

6
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:42,987
- What's going on?
- Number five bulkhead shut down.

7
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:45,046
- Control, Maneuvering.
- Control, Captain.

8
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:47,935
I'm losing electrical frequency.
I'll have to break down the system.

9
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:49,212
Control, Sound Room.

10
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:56,286
Total loss of power
on all sonar sets.

11
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:58,394
Surface.
Blow forward, blow aft, full ahead.

12
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:00,539
Full rise on both planes.
Raise the search periscope.

13
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:21,954
Oh, my God.

14
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:24,088
Yeah, put him through.

15
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:25,506
Good morning, sir.

16
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,215
No, First Sea Lord.

17
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:31,466
There's been no contact
with Ranger yet, sir.

18
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,097
No sightings,
no distress signals, sir.

19
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:37,475
It looks very much like it.

20
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,383
Yes, of course I will, sir.

21
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:45,133
We've lost one
of our nuclear submarines.

22
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:51,207
What?

23
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:55,205
The submarine Potempkin
disappeared without trace?

24
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:59,659
What a catastrophe, Comrade Chairman.

25
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,657
Yes, of course.
I'll assign our best agent immediately.

26
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:11,273
- Rubelvitch, where is Agent XXX?
- On leave, General.

27
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:14,078
At a people's rest
and recuperation center.

28
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,071
It's been a wonderful weekend.

29
00:03:27,497 --> 00:03:29,863
- I shall never forget it.
- Nor will I.

30
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,767
When can we meet again?

31
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,009
As soon as my mission
is accomplished.

32
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:41,525
I must go.
I have to be in Austria tonight.

33
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,882
Five more minutes.

34
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:52,779
Agent XXX.
Calling Agent XXX.

35
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:55,079
You will report to headquarters
immediately.

36
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,984
Agent XXX,
acknowledge and verify.

37
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:09,977
This is XXX.
Message received and understood.

38
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:13,995
Yes, Mr. Prime Minister. I understand
the gravity of the situation.

39
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:17,839
Yes, I'll put our best man on it
at once.

40
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,226
Good-bye.

41
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:29,368
Moneypenny, where is 007?

42
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,412
He's on a mission, sir,
in Austria.

43
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:34,097
Tell him to pull out,
immediately.

44
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:46,591
Oh, James,
I cannot find the words.

45
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:50,232
Let me try
and enlarge your vocabulary.

46
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:14,850
What's happened?

47
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,544
- Where are you going?
- Sorry, darling. Something came up.

48
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:25,610
But, James, I need you.

49
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,009
So does England.

50
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,760
He has just left.

51
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,389
Over and out.

52
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:43,122
Message received. We are waiting.
Over and out.

53
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:56,449
Now.

54
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:56,538
Nobody does it better

55
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:04,240
Makes me feel sad for the rest

56
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:09,614
Nobody does it

57
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:14,173
Half as good as you

58
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:18,287
Baby, you're the best

59
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,882
I wasn't looking

60
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:26,545
But somehow you found me

61
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:29,550
I tried to hide from

62
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:33,980
Your love light

63
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:37,390
But like heaven above me

64
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:40,254
The spy who loved me

65
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:45,432
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

66
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:52,644
And nobody does it better

67
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:57,225
Though sometimes I wish

68
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,421
Someone could

69
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:05,003
Nobody does it

70
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:08,029
Quite the way you do

71
00:09:09,191 --> 00:09:13,218
Why do you have to be so good

72
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,790
The way that you hold me

73
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:22,561
Whenever you hold me

74
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:24,632
There's some kind of magic

75
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:29,450
Inside you

76
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,482
That keeps me from running

77
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:35,221
But just keep it coming

78
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:40,670
How'd you learn
to do the things you do

79
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:07,899
Baby, baby

80
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:10,543
Baby, you're the best

81
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:25,272
Send in Agent XXX.

82
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:36,553
You sent for me, Comrade General.

83
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:40,977
Good morning. Major Amasova,
we are facing a most delicate situation.

84
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:44,498
Our nuclear submarine Potempkin
has disappeared.

85
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:45,855
Sabotage?

86
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:49,092
That is for you to find out.
We have one lead:

87
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:50,963
a connection in Cairo.

88
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,382
You leave tonight.

89
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,084
Will that be all?

90
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,355
There is one more thing.

91
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:05,205
I regret to inform you, Major, that
Agent Sergei Borzov has been killed.

92
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:12,824
On a mission at Berngarten
in the Austrian Alps.

93
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:17,345
A tragic occurrence,
Comrade General.

94
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:19,911
It had not escaped our notice
that you and Agent Borzov...

95
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:23,313
had been more than friends
for some time.

96
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:24,670
I'm very sorry.

97
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:26,577
How did he die?

98
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:28,055
We haven't all the details yet.

99
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:32,199
It appears he'd become involved
in a British Secret Service operation.

100
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,822
Please keep me informed,
Comrade General.

101
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,715
I should very much like to meet...

102
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:40,067
whoever was responsible
for his death.

103
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:07,782
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

104
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:09,715
- Good morning, 007.
- Hello, Q.

105
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:12,636
- Mission successful?
- On and off.

106
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,913
- Good morning, Commander.
- Good morning, sir.

107
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:17,479
- Captain Forsyth.
- Sir.

108
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,969
Commander Bond, sir.

109
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:21,575
- Mr. Fredrick Gray, Minister of Defense.
- Good morning, Commander.

110
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,510
Admiral Hargreaves,
Flag Officer, Submarines.

111
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,853
- Ark Royal, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:30,052
- I believe M told you about this.
- Yes, Minister.

113
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:31,923
Over here, please, gentlemen.

114
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:00,992
This, I take it, is Ranger's
prearranged coastal patrol area.

115
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:04,799
- That's right.
- How many people knew this course?

116
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,438
Admiral Hargreaves, myself...

117
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:08,632
and Talbot, the submarine captain.

118
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:18,366
Good God.

119
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:23,347
Where did this come from?

120
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,563
I'm sorry, Benson.
For the moment, that's top secret.

121
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,772
I see, sir.
Commander, this tracing means...

122
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:33,339
that the Russians can track our nuclear
submarines underwater and sink them.

123
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:35,985
- I believe it does.
- How could they? It's impossible.

124
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:39,219
It's quite simple.

125
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:43,039
Heat signature recognition,
most likely.

126
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:45,042
- With your permission, Minister?
- Yes, of course.

127
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,621
Thank you.

128
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:49,496
We already know that satellites
with infrared heat sensors...

129
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:52,710
can detect a nuclear missile
in flight by its tail fire.

130
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:53,976
Well?

131
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:57,425
Someone can now locate
a submerged nuclear submarine...

132
00:13:57,349 --> 00:14:01,786
in exactly the same way,
by its wake.

133
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:05,799
That means they can totally undermine
our Western defense strategy.

134
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:07,134
Yes, it looks like it.

135
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:10,421
Where did we get that tracing, Freddie?

136
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,669
Cairo, diplomatic bag.

137
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:16,672
Somebody got the plans of that tracking
system and is trying to sell them.

138
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:19,414
They sent us that tracing as proof
that it's genuine.

139
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:22,334
Then, if there is a deal to be made,
the price will be high.

140
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:25,405
"High"? Astronomical.

141
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:29,308
That missing submarine
had 16 Polaris missiles aboard.

142
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,514
We have a contact in Egypt?

143
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:35,953
M will give you the details.
You leave tonight.

144
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:48,440
Dr. Bechmann
and Professor Markovitz.

145
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:49,981
Thank you.

146
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,481
Gentlemen, now that the moment
has come to bid you farewell...

147
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:56,678
I congratulate both you, Doctor,
and you, Professor...

148
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:59,673
on your brilliant work
in the development...

149
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:01,987
of the submarine tracking system.

150
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:05,050
Thanks primarily to you,
I'm happy to say...

151
00:15:04,997 --> 00:15:07,693
that the first phase
of our operation...

152
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:10,087
has met with considerable success.

153
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:12,248
I have instructed my assistant...

154
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:13,992
to have paid into your...

155
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,889
Swiss bank account...

156
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:19,404
the sum of $10 million each.

157
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,494
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, indeed.

158
00:15:21,477 --> 00:15:25,072
And that, I think,
concludes our business.

159
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,965
Before you go, however...

160
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:30,535
I very much regret to inform you...

161
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,401
that a dangerous development...

162
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,290
has recently been brought
to my notice.

163
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:38,206
Someone has been attempting
to sell the plans...

164
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:40,447
of our tracking project...

165
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,355
to competing world powers.

166
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,833
Someone intimately associated
with the project.

167
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:50,176
My dear, it would be more seemly
if you left us.

168
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:52,510
Thank you.

169
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:23,490
It was you
who betrayed me.

170
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:26,193
You had access
to all the information.

171
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:29,141
Now you will pay the penalty.

172
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:56,410
Once again, gentlemen,
my most profound thanks.

173
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:15,342
- Sandor.
- Yes, sir.

174
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:20,158
Jaws.

175
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:23,730
I'm assigning you the task...

176
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:25,946
of recovering the microfilm copy...

177
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:27,859
of the tracking system.

178
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:32,590
Sandor, you will go with him.
Obey him.

179
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:36,886
Every person who even comes into contact
with that microfilm...

180
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:38,934
is to be eliminated.

181
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,233
Stand by for helicopter takeoff.

182
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:58,572
All personnel,
clear the flight deck platform.

183
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:30,036
Cancel transfer of $20 million.

184
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:34,151
Inform next of kin
that a tragic accident...

185
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:36,885
has resulted in the death
of Professor Markovitz...

186
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:38,828
and Dr. Bechmann.

187
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:42,852
The funeral was at sea.

188
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:41,690
May the peace of Allah
descend upon this magnificent abode...

189
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,569
and allow a poor traveler
to enter.

190
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:45,989
May the hospitality
of these miserable quarters...

191
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:48,219
be sufficient
to your honored needs.

192
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:57,248
James Bond, what a delightful surprise
after all these years.

193
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:58,652
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

194
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:05,667
I always wondered what you were gonna do
when you went down from Cambridge.

195
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:08,599
I never had any problems knowing
what you were going to do, Hosein.

196
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:12,964
We don't only have oil, you know.

197
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:16,164
What can I offer you?
Sheep's eyes? Dates?

198
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,159
- Vodka martini?
- Information.

199
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:21,667
Who is putting the submarine
tracking system on the market?

200
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:26,108
What a pity it is you insist
on being so businesslike.

201
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:37,055
The gentleman you will
eventually be dealing with...

202
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:38,756
is a certain Max Kalba.

203
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,019
- "Eventually"?
- To reach Kalba...

204
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:43,828
you must first make contact
with a man called Fekkesh.

205
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:47,044
Aziz Fekkesh. I'll give you
his apartment address in Cairo.

206
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:49,914
It's too late to meet him today.

207
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:53,955
Can I persuade you to accept a bed
for the night?

208
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:59,271
That's kind of you, Hosein,
but I really feel I--

209
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:09,981
Are you quite sure I can't persuade you
to stay the night?

210
00:22:11,843 --> 00:22:14,403
When one is in Egypt...

211
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:16,498
one should delve deeply
into its treasures.

212
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:37,419
Yes. Oh, I'm sorry.
The door was open.

213
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:40,144
Mr. Fekkesh is expecting me.
I phoned him.

214
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:41,657
He asked me
to give you a message.

215
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,396
He will be late.

216
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:45,386
May I ask where he is?

217
00:23:45,378 --> 00:23:49,007
Mr. Fekkesh asked me to entertain you
while you are waiting.

218
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:50,364
Really?

219
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:03,092
Where is Fekkesh?

220
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,236
You are very suspicious.

221
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:07,414
I find I live much longer that way.

222
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:09,329
Now where is he?

223
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:17,516
If there's anything at all
you would like--

224
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:21,645
I had lunch,
but I seem to have missed dessert.

225
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:32,302
As urgent as my appointment is,
I'd hate him to walk in and surprise us.

226
00:24:32,227 --> 00:24:35,219
There is no danger of that.

227
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,353
He'll be some time then?

228
00:24:39,523 --> 00:24:41,457
Is he meeting someone?

229
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:46,710
I'm sorry,
I cannot answer that question.

230
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:49,251
Oh, I think you can.

231
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:08,471
Where's Fekkesh?

232
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,323
Pyramids.

233
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:16,956
What a helpful chap.

234
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:26,743
You have come tonight
to the most fabulous...

235
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,284
and celebrated place
in the world.

236
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:35,685
Here on the Plateau of Giza
stands forever...

237
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,579
the mightiest of human achievements.

238
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:43,469
No traveler, emperor,
merchant or poet...

239
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:46,591
has trodden on these sands...

240
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,998
and not gasped in awe.

241
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,137
The curtain of night
is about to rise...

242
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:59,160
and disclose the stage on which...

243
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:01,972
the drama of a civilization
took place.

244
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:09,208
Those involved have been present
since the dawn of history...

245
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,753
pitched stubbornly
against sand and wind.

246
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:18,150
And the voice of the desert...

247
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:20,048
has crossed the centuries.

248
00:27:31,137 --> 00:27:34,629
Excuse me, Major.
I'll be back in a moment.

249
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:48,157
With each new dawn,
I see the sun god rise...

250
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,696
on the far bank of the Nile.

251
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:42,892
I am the faithful warden
at the foot of his lord.

252
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,987
So faithful, so vigilant...

253
00:28:46,914 --> 00:28:48,472
so near him...

254
00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:51,883
that he gave me his face
for my own.

255
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:57,635
I am a pharaoh's companion...

256
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,439
and I am he, the pharaoh.

257
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:42,903
This is the tomb of Cheops...

258
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:48,930
Pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty
4,500 years ago.

259
00:29:48,802 --> 00:29:52,636
Here is the Great Pyramid
which he built...

260
00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:56,175
to defend himself against death.

261
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:21,395
Here in the depths of his tomb...

262
00:30:21,346 --> 00:30:24,213
a servant of the king
awaits the call...

263
00:30:24,162 --> 00:30:27,859
to set out upon his journey
into eternity.

264
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:31,487
Death lies waiting.

265
00:30:53,345 --> 00:30:54,778
Where is Fekkesh?

266
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,947
With the pharaohs.

267
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,831
- You killed him.
- No, he was dead when I found him.

268
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,050
Hope you enjoyed the show.

269
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:27,451
Good night.

270
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:07,156
What an unexpected pleasure.
Welcome to the Mujaba Club.

271
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:10,737
Buy you a drink,
Major Amasova?

272
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:12,592
Or may I call you XXX?

273
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:15,399
You know who I am.

274
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:17,521
You made quite an impression.

275
00:32:17,506 --> 00:32:19,997
I'm sorry about Ivan and Boris.

276
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,768
They exceeded their orders.

277
00:32:21,762 --> 00:32:24,390
Good staff is hard to find these days.

278
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:26,049
Yes, sir?

279
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,746
The lady will have a Bacardi
on the rocks.

280
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:33,609
For the gentleman,
vodka martini, shaken not stirred.

281
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,139
Touché.

282
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:35,969
Touché.

283
00:32:36,002 --> 00:32:37,993
Commander James Bond.

284
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:41,478
Recruited to the British Secret Service
from the Royal Navy.

285
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,902
Licensed to kill, and has done so
on numerous occasions.

286
00:32:44,835 --> 00:32:47,599
Many lady friends,
but married only once.

287
00:32:47,554 --> 00:32:51,149
- Wife killed--
- All right, you've made your point.

288
00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:54,005
You're sensitive.

289
00:32:54,018 --> 00:32:55,451
About certain things, yes.

290
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,539
Now, if you'll excuse me.

291
00:32:58,531 --> 00:33:00,795
Tragically,
I have a previous engagement.

292
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,000
Happily enough, so do I.

293
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:06,107
- Good-bye, Mr. Bond.
- Let's say au revoir.

294
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,577
I have the oddest feeling
we'll be meeting again sometime.

295
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:19,547
I'm looking for Mr. Kalba.

296
00:33:19,554 --> 00:33:22,284
Mr. Max Kalba is the owner
of the club, sir.

297
00:33:22,242 --> 00:33:23,675
Over there.

298
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:48,614
Mr. Kalba,
my name is James Bond.

299
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:50,382
What of it?

300
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:53,363
You had an appointment
with Mr. Fekkesh.

301
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:56,943
- Well?
- He won't be joining you.

302
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,426
You have something
I'm interested in buying.

303
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,844
Just a moment.
I would like to bid for it too.

304
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:17,008
You forgot your drink.

305
00:34:18,146 --> 00:34:19,579
Thank you.

306
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,770
It seems you have competition,
Mr. Bond.

307
00:34:23,714 --> 00:34:25,773
From where I sit...

308
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:30,893
I fancy you will find the lady's figure
hard to match.

309
00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:34,315
Might the contestants be permitted
to view the article for sale?

310
00:34:44,354 --> 00:34:47,619
Well, now,
who will start the bidding?

311
00:34:49,474 --> 00:34:52,841
Mr. Kalba, sir, the telephone.
An urgent call.

312
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:54,705
Excuse me.

313
00:35:01,314 --> 00:35:02,747
Pardon me.

314
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,540
This is Kalba. Hello?

315
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:50,870
Another?

316
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,318
We've really got to stop
meeting like this.

317
00:37:05,602 --> 00:37:08,799
Kalba was called to the phone.
What happened?

318
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:13,283
He was cut off, permanently.

319
00:37:13,218 --> 00:37:15,812
Where is the microfilm?

320
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:18,331
Search me.

321
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:21,000
He must have it,
or you wouldn't be here.

322
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:22,395
You don't know who he is.

323
00:37:22,402 --> 00:37:25,496
- He's a professional killer.
- Called Jaws?

324
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:28,700
Make no mistake, Mr. Bond...

325
00:37:28,674 --> 00:37:30,938
I want that microfilm...

326
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:33,007
and I'm going to get it.

327
00:37:32,994 --> 00:37:34,928
Unless I get it first.

328
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,983
Watch out!

329
00:40:55,426 --> 00:40:57,257
Don't move.

330
00:41:02,402 --> 00:41:05,633
Give me the microfilm.

331
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:49,019
Egyptian builders.

332
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,876
Sorry.
You're just too late.

333
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:23,046
Give me the key!

334
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,819
The key!

335
00:42:35,394 --> 00:42:36,554
Try the big one.

336
00:42:43,138 --> 00:42:45,072
Can you play any other tune?

337
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,825
Let's try reverse.
That's backwards.

338
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:09,136
Would you like me to drive?

339
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,203
Women drivers.

340
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,144
Quiet. Watch this.

341
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,847
Shaken, but not stirred.

342
00:43:56,418 --> 00:44:00,047
That gorilla must have his teeth
fixed by a riveter.

343
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,064
By the way,
thanks for deserting me back there.

344
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,376
Every woman for herself.
Remember?

345
00:44:06,754 --> 00:44:10,281
Still, you did save my life.

346
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,508
We all make mistakes, Mr. Bond.

347
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:47,547
The cylinder head gasket.

348
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:34,875
What did he say?

349
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:37,783
He thinks we're overdressed,
but he'll take us to Cairo.

350
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,163
Good.

351
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,623
It's getting cold.

352
00:46:39,585 --> 00:46:42,383
Is there anything I can do
to warm you up?

353
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:45,533
You don't have to worry about me.

354
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,906
I went on a survival course
in Siberia.

355
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:52,810
Yes, I believe a great number
of your countrymen do.

356
00:46:52,673 --> 00:46:54,140
What did they teach you?

357
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:58,707
That it's very important
to have a positive mental attitude.

358
00:46:58,593 --> 00:47:01,084
Nothing more practical than that?

359
00:47:01,057 --> 00:47:04,424
Food is also very important.

360
00:47:05,793 --> 00:47:07,226
What else?

361
00:47:07,233 --> 00:47:11,761
When necessary,
shared bodily warmth.

362
00:47:13,537 --> 00:47:14,970
That's the part I like.

363
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:25,422
Is this really what they do
in Siberia?

364
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:29,175
Yes, but not how they do it.

365
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:44,149
You're not trying to take advantage
of me, are you?

366
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,635
The thought never crossed my mind.

367
00:47:55,744 --> 00:47:58,474
Just when it was getting interesting.

368
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:30,874
Where's the girl?

369
00:49:41,121 --> 00:49:42,952
- Morning, Moneypenny.
- Good morning, James.

370
00:49:42,945 --> 00:49:45,072
Is he in?

371
00:49:45,057 --> 00:49:47,389
It must have been quite a party.

372
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:49,847
Boring.

373
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:51,347
I dropped off.

374
00:50:09,408 --> 00:50:11,501
Hello, James.
We've been expecting you.

375
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:12,922
Good morning, sir.

376
00:50:12,928 --> 00:50:16,329
There's been a change in plan.

377
00:50:16,257 --> 00:50:20,717
You probably recognize my opposite
number in the KGB, General Gogol.

378
00:50:20,608 --> 00:50:24,544
I believe you're familiar
with Major Amasova.

379
00:50:24,448 --> 00:50:26,609
Enough to know which brand
of cigarette she smokes.

380
00:50:26,593 --> 00:50:28,220
Our respective governments...

381
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:32,286
agreed to pool their resources to find
out what happened to our submarines.

382
00:50:33,088 --> 00:50:35,079
We have entered a new era...

383
00:50:35,072 --> 00:50:37,165
of Anglo-Soviet cooperation.

384
00:50:37,153 --> 00:50:40,554
As a sign of Russian good faith...

385
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,448
I'm prepared to make available to you
the microfilm...

386
00:50:42,432 --> 00:50:44,900
recovered by Agent XXX.

387
00:50:44,864 --> 00:50:48,061
With considerable ease,
I might add.

388
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,961
Don't bother. It's useless.

389
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,774
I examined it on the boat.

390
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:57,175
I assure you it is quite genuine.

391
00:50:57,152 --> 00:51:01,282
Except that the vital technical
information has been taken out.

392
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:03,345
This was only intended
to whet our appetites.

393
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:11,057
Maybe Q can make something
out of it.

394
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:31,295
I want that ready
for Akmid's tea party.

395
00:51:32,575 --> 00:51:34,167
After you, Alexis.

396
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,405
- After you, Miles.
- Thank you.

397
00:51:55,295 --> 00:51:57,229
That could bring tears
to your eyes.

398
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:07,536
Everybody ready? Right.

399
00:52:08,927 --> 00:52:12,328
We're pretty certain that this drawing
was drafted in Italy.

400
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:15,156
The size corresponds
with a Venetian octavo...

401
00:52:15,102 --> 00:52:17,536
and the typeface
is an Italian one.

402
00:52:17,503 --> 00:52:21,803
Now, note the slight upward stress
on the transversals.

403
00:52:21,695 --> 00:52:23,959
What's that mark there?

404
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:27,286
Probably a show-through
of something...

405
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,356
the drawing was resting on
when it was photographed.

406
00:52:29,343 --> 00:52:31,311
Must have been done in a hurry.

407
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:34,025
- Can you enlarge it?
- Wait a minute.

408
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:41,153
- "Oratory"? What is that?
- It's another word for chapel.

409
00:52:41,055 --> 00:52:44,115
Looks a bit like a bishop's miter.

410
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:47,171
It is a fish.

411
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:49,965
That is the symbol
of the Stromberg Shipping Line.

412
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:52,819
Karl Stromberg? He's one
of the richest men in the world.

413
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:56,203
One of the principle capitalist
exploiters of the West, sir.

414
00:52:56,127 --> 00:52:58,220
So it's not "oratory,"
it's laboratory.

415
00:52:58,206 --> 00:53:00,936
Stromberg has a marine
research laboratory.

416
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:02,418
On Corsica, I believe.

417
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:05,784
Well done.

418
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,550
Actually, it is in Sardinia.

419
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:14,853
That's brilliant.

420
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:17,714
I'm certain that two such
perceptive talents...

421
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:20,859
will enjoy working together
in Sardinia...

422
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:25,667
and that it will help to make
Anglo-Soviet cooperation a reality.

423
00:53:41,406 --> 00:53:42,839
Here we are.

424
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:47,235
That was a delicious meal.
Thank you.

425
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:50,717
I didn't realize you had
such a healthy appetite.

426
00:53:50,687 --> 00:53:52,279
Neither did I.

427
00:53:52,287 --> 00:53:55,450
It must be traveling by train.
I always enjoy it.

428
00:53:55,391 --> 00:53:57,951
I remember when--

429
00:53:57,919 --> 00:53:59,511
What do you remember?

430
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,420
I was going to talk about a mission.

431
00:54:03,486 --> 00:54:05,249
Silly, isn't it?

432
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:07,374
We can't talk,
and yet we're in the same business.

433
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,295
- But with rival companies.
- We're not rivals at the moment.

434
00:54:13,055 --> 00:54:18,322
Then how about a nightcap,
on the company?

435
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:19,608
My company.

436
00:54:19,614 --> 00:54:23,744
I'm very sorry. I have an idea
tomorrow is going to be a busy day.

437
00:54:23,646 --> 00:54:27,173
- I must sleep.
- Yes.

438
00:54:27,103 --> 00:54:30,539
- Well, then, sleep well.
- And you.

439
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:33,400
Good night.

440
00:57:15,134 --> 00:57:17,329
What happened?

441
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,744
He just dropped in
for a quick bite.

442
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,703
You're hurt.

443
00:57:24,511 --> 00:57:26,103
Later.

444
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,704
Let's worry about you.

445
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:33,266
What was it they taught you
on that survival course?

446
00:57:33,151 --> 00:57:35,745
A positive mental attitude.

447
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,264
And shared bodily warmth.

448
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,944
Nothing about keeping out of drafts?

449
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:48,755
Still enjoy traveling by train?

450
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,336
You saved my life.

451
00:57:55,569 --> 00:57:57,036
Thank you, James.

452
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,243
I'm sorry.

453
00:58:03,601 --> 00:58:06,126
Why don't you lie down
and let me look at it?

454
00:58:28,497 --> 00:58:31,091
What can we use for a bandage?

455
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:34,251
How about this?

456
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:17,226
Wait a moment.

457
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:37,726
- Good morning, Major Boothroyd.
- Good morning, Major.

458
00:59:37,713 --> 00:59:40,648
Look what Q has brought for us.
Isn't it nice?

459
00:59:44,913 --> 00:59:46,847
Right.
Now pay attention, 007.

460
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,997
Take great care of this equipment.
There are some special accessories--

461
00:59:50,897 --> 00:59:54,298
- Have I ever let you down?
- Frequently.

462
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,655
You have a reservation for me.
The name is Sterling.

463
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:32,321
Yes. Mr. and Mrs. Sterling.
Booked from Cairo.

464
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:33,674
That's right.

465
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:38,914
We have Suite A-5 for you;
a sitting room and two bedrooms.

466
01:00:40,177 --> 01:00:44,671
Moneypenny being over-efficient.
Do you have any messages for me?
