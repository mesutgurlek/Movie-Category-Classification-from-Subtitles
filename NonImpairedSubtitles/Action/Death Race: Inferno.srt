As a businessman,
takeover talk is common.

30
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,792
You have something of value, naturally,
people want to take it away.

33
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,199
Well, I've got nothing to say
about that at the moment.

34
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,902
But I will say this.

35
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:22,608
When I want something, no one
can stop me from taking it.

36
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,377
I'm not too concerned. I've won
more battles than I've lost.

37
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,547
I feel bad for Weyland, I really do.

38
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,250
But Father Time, he's
caught up with the old man.

39
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,584
He never really stood a chance.

40
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,666
Good morning,
Mr. Weyland.

(NILES SIGHS)

42
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,671
Wasn't so bad, was it?

43
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,846
I built this business.

44
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,781
I didn't have to steal it.

45
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,450
What you left vulnerable,
I seized. I stole nothing.

46
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,720
You lacked vision, Weyland.
That was your undoing.

47
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,929
Vision.

(DOOR SHUTS)

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,468
Is that why you're investing millions in
dilapidated prisons all around the globe?

50
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,338
Vision?

51
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,675
You're so far over your head, you might
as well be six feet under the ground.

52
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:33,412
The prison business is not what
made this company profitable.

53
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,280
So the conclusion to draw,

54
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,552
<i>you're trying to franchise Death Race.</i>

55
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,391
(CHUCKLES) It's not going to work.

56
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,627
Because you couldn't make it work.

57
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,530
Let me show you what true
vision really looks like.

58
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,742
You started something
beautiful, Weyland.

59
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,811
But you only scratched at the surface.

60
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,847
<i>And you're right. I'm
taking Death Race global.</i>

61

<i>By this time next year, there will
be a different race every two weeks</i>

62
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:16,388
at a different exotic hellhole with
different drivers, tracks and challenges.

63
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,476
I will have a monopoly
on the most profitable

64
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:22,561
sport in the history of the planet.

65
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,530
More cars.
More cons. More guns.

66
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,833
More death.
The sky's the limit.

00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,842
Well, you forgot one thing.

69
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,445
Frankenstein.

70
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,716
It's a man in a mask.

71
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,918
I could have 20 Frankensteins
around the globe.

72
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,021
How would the fans know
which one was real?

73
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,590
Frankenstein won his fourth race today.

74
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,760
One more win, he goes free.

75
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,462
That's a fact that every fan knows.

76
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,932
Now, if you suddenly change
the rules of the game,

77
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,068
you're going to lose your audience.

78
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,904
And if you're hoping
that Frankenstein loses,

79
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,874
well, son, I guess
there's a first time.

80
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:12,411
Now, how would your
little copycat event play

81
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,913
without the game's marquee star?

82
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,982
That's why you're going to fail.

83
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,388
What kind of cigars you smoke, Weyland?

84

<i>I'll be sure to send you a box when
Death Race becomes a global success.</i>

85

It'll be the second time I've beaten you.
The second time you've lost.

86

Well, you enjoy your
moment while you can.

NILES: Weyland's right.

What do you mean?

93
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,058

eight million quid a week

94
