1
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:47,995
Reputed crime boss Gaetano Chezere...

2
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:50,535
Once again avoided prison
when a mistrial was declared

3
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:52,735
today in his 8-week-long RICO prosecution.

4
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,243
Allegedly responsible for over 200 murders,

5
00:00:56,516 --> 00:01:01,305
Chezere has yet to spend one day behind bars.

6
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,805
Mr Eugene Gordlock, a witness that repeatedly
asked to be recused from the case

7
00:01:04,836 --> 00:01:08,306
was gunned down just a few hours earlier.

8
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,934
Punisher - War Zone
(subs by MajorTJKong)

9
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:51,337
The pained words of a grieving woman,

10
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:54,808
left all alone in a city outraged 
by today's developments

11
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,935
No concrete evidence of tampering, 
and with Mr Gordlock now dead...

12
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,422
Do I fix your
make up for you?

13
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:49,000
Come on.

14
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:57,791
You know so, the captain should have
sent me out here with 30 or 40 men

15
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,928
to raze this bloody get out of jail party.

16
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:00,463
Instead I'm stuck here with you.

17
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:01,931
He might come out tonight.

18
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,840
As a matter of fact I'm
pretty sure he's going to show up.

19
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,086
And what are you going to do?

20
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:10,213
I'm going to bring him in.

21
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:16,265
You know, you kill me so.
Let's just say you can make this happen.

22
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:17,770
Why would you?

23
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:22,052
He does to those bastard what
me and you can only fantasize about

24
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:27,795
Hey, keep your nose clean.
-Yeah, sure thing pops.

25
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:41,266
Hey, Okay now, I was just, uh...
Take it easy in there, ok?

26
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:42,361
Nicky

27
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:44,261
What am I going to do?

28
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:46,602
Give the old guy a heart attack?

29
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,427
Go on, beat it.
- Give me una minuto.

30
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,569
You handled the witness situation...

31
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,877
... perfectly.

32
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,346
No sweat, Uncle G.

33
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,549
You look great?

34
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:13,777
The hell I do.
I shit in a bag for Christ's sake.

35
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:16,511
Hey, it saves you a
trip to the can, right?

36
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,121
You came to discuss a private matter.

37
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:23,325
Down at the docks!
-Right yeah, Cristu Bulat.

38
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,504
I hear he's a sick fucker...

39
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,157
...fresh off the boat.

40
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,671
Cristu's bringing in a shipment.
Needs a safe port.

41
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,856
I've arranged for my custom's guy
Simmons to be on that night...

42
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:35,624
The union boys will be there to unload
Our cut's 10 mil.

43
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:37,058
We won't break a sweat.

44
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,403
10 mil. What's Cristu's shipment?
-I don't know.

45
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:47,255
Some kind of biological package.
-Biological package!

46
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:49,190
I fucking knew it!

47
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,461
Probably going up to
the rag heads in Queens.

48
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:54,470
Cristu's guaranteed it's leaving the city.

49
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,682
We don't touch that kind that shit!

50
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:59,789
In case your memory is going along with
the rest of your bodily functions...

51
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,387
... you might like to remember,
I'm the top earner around here.

52
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,295
I'm not stupid.
- Stupido.

53
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:07,696
You're as shithouse crazy as your brother,...

54
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,901
...Loony Bin Jimmy.

55
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:13,785
I should have had the
both of you locked away!

56
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,588
One more word about my brother,
I swear to Christ I'll....

57
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:19,630
You know what,
you make one move you greasy fuck!

58
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,006
Hey, let's just all calm down here, ok.

59
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,158
I put on a big spread out here,

60
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:29,522
So come on boys.

61
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:30,821
Eat up!

62
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,719
I'm not fucking eating with that
shit bag. You understand?

63
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:42,120
Pittzy, pour me a drink!

64
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:26,721
Vaffanculo!

65
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:28,412
What the fuck?

66
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:23,891
Let's go!

67
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:02,064
Alright, let's split up.
Shouldn't we wait for back up?

68
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:17,165
Police! Freeze!

69
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,292
Listen, Billy Russoti is getting away.

70
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:29,831
The silver Rover.

71
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,430
Might want to head out to the docks first.

72
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,165
Shit! That hurt!

73
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:49,415
What happen to you?

74
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:53,556
Your Punisher. He disarmed me, held me at gunpoint
then he stole my damn ride.

75
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,220
And where the hell were you, huh?

76
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:58,134
I know he would come.
Let me get your statement.

77
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:01,937
Come on, Cesare, tell me everything.

78
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,449
How'd it go down? Huh?

79
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:30,053
-muffled-

80
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,865
Oh well. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.

81
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:39,240
It's time for me to take over
anyway, thanks to the Punisher!

82
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,944
I won't even get my fucking hands dirty.

83
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,693
There's your problem.

84
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,862
What the fuck he doing here?
-Relax!

85
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,097
I asked him to come.

86
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:52,909
My man. How are you doing?

87
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,480
Who the fuck are these fanooks?

88
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:56,317
These are a couple of my colleagues.

89
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:58,923
They are very very...

90
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:02,263
...gifted deliverymen.
No mountain too high. No river...

91
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:03,464
...too deep.

92
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:07,681
Alright, alright...enough!

93
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,212
Pittsy, get me some money.

94
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:10,559
Time to go to work.

95
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:12,154
Running a little low, boss.

96
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,095
We just picked up 200K from
the Luciano Construction site.

97
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,309
I had to launder it
through the Pussy Cat lounge

98
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,835
Like you told me, remember?

99
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:22,723
Well bring it back tomorrow.
- You got it boss.

100
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:28,002
Here. That's 20 rolls of hundreds.
That's a grand each, all counted.

101
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:30,338
Head for the port. Do your monkey thing.
Get over the security fence. Hand out the money.

102
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:34,706
Hey, where the fuck you going?

103
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:39,157
Will it be alright if
I took the roof instead of the door?

104
00:12:39,397 --> 00:12:39,921
Whatever.

105
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:41,100
You're a fucking saint.

106
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:14,501
Hey, what's the matter?

107
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:53,402
Fuck!

108
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:54,426
What the fuck with that?

109
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:56,276
Agent down! Repeat, agent down! Fuck!

110
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,577
I'll check it out boss.

111
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:13,594
Pop!
-No, I'l take care of it.

112
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:14,659
You get the guards!

113
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:16,427
Pittsy!

114
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,531
Fuck!
Fuck you Castle!

115
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:37,040
Come on, Frank!

116
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,696
Fuck you, Frank!
Fuck you Castle you fuckin...

117
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,901
Pittsy! Pittsy!

118
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:02,502
There he is!

119
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:54,673
FBl, drop your weapons!

120
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:55,504
Oh shit! Shit!

121
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:56,774
You two, up the stairs.
The rest, behind me.

122
00:15:58,783 --> 00:15:59,341
Don't move!

123
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:00,986
FBI

124
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:02,016
Put your weapons down!

125
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:03,017
We got a live one!

126
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:06,257
Billy the Beaut!

127
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:09,930
Not anymore, eh?

128
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,801
Wait a minute.

129
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,309
The Lord is compassion and love.

130
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,975
Slow to anger and rich in mercy.

131
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:34,825
He does not treat us according to our sin,
nor repay us according to our faults

132
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,605
As parents have compassion on their children

133
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:42,080
The Lord had pity of those here.

134
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:46,689
For he know of what we are made.
He remembers that we are dust

135
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:50,398
And for us, our days are like grass.

136
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:54,277
We flower like a flower in a field.

137
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:59,848
The wind blows and we are gone,
and our place never sees us again.

138
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,283
I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

139
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:26,053
Who compromised Donatelli?

140
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:28,727
Calm down Budiansky.
It wasn't anybody's fault.

141
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:32,269
None of us could have foreseen Frank Castle
opening up hunting season on La Cosa Nostra.

142
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,169
Come on!

143
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:36,029
Look, Donatelli sent us a message.

144
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,363
He said something big is going to happen.

145
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:42,061
He asked for Homeland Security. We've
been running 24 hours surveillance on Russoti.

146
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:44,199
And just as we were about to find
out what the fuck is happening,

147
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,103
Donatelli got shot
believe me!

148
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,841
No one's more pissed off about it than I am!

149
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:50,414
How is it we are not all over Frank Castle?

150
00:19:50,414 --> 00:19:53,923
Because we have real National Security
threat, and the last time I checked

151
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:56,394
that tops trying to stop some
crazed vigilante.

152
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:58,329
Go!

153
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:05,239
Hey.
- Hey.

154
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:07,947
I'm going to get this guy Angie.

155
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,627
I promise you.

156
00:21:48,402 --> 00:21:50,469
I heard the Bureau
was sending a baby sitter.

157
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:53,175
A liaison.
-Thirty years on the force.

158
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:55,816
I still don't know what that word means.

159
00:21:55,987 --> 00:21:59,154
We have a certain way of doing
things around here, Special Agent Budiansky.

160
00:21:59,663 --> 00:22:02,100
Like letting mass murderers run free?

161
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,270
4 years, this Punisher
has been wreaking havoc.

162
00:22:06,178 --> 00:22:08,317
And you haven't once caught a break.


163
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:10,117
I'm always deep in shit
around here as you can plainly see.

164
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:15,992
Your buddies from the Bureau told me
the city is under some kind of terror threat

165
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,807
New Yorkers are a bit sensitive
about that if you know what I mean.

166
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:24,921
I've got all my men trying to find out what
your late colleague came across when he went under.

167
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:31,440
Maybe if you Feds allowed us lowly cops
in on your undercover operations once in a while

168
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,944
all of this could have been avoided.

169
00:22:33,004 --> 00:22:35,610
With all due respect, Captain,...

170
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:38,713
that, is bullshit!

171
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,598
What if it had been your man lying there, huh?

172
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:43,626
in a pool of his own blood?

173
00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:50,018
You crispy crème mother fuckers
would be beating down every door in the city

174
00:22:50,018 --> 00:22:53,049
Captain. Captain, You know what?

175
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:57,899
The Punisher task force could
use an extra man.

176
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,382
Room 12,

177
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:07,117
The basement.

178
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:29,905
Ah, Agent Budiansky?
Did I get that right?

179
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:32,354
Captain told me you were coming in.

180
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:35,424
Welcome to the Punisher task force.

181
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:38,169
I'm Detective Martin Soap.
Pleasure.

182
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:44,041
Make yourself at home.
-You have a degree in behavioral psychology

183
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:48,618
Surprised?
That's okay, most people are.

184
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:53,331
So, what do you actually do here?

185
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,935
Here?
- Uh huh.

186
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:57,422
This is ground zero.

187
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:01,350
I shadowed his every step for the last five years.

188
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:06,270
I've documented every murder that fit his profile.

189
00:24:06,506 --> 00:24:09,536
I've collected intelligence on all known associates.

190
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,812
Take the look at this.

191
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,617
Six years ago,

192
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:18,298
Frank Castle was a
Special Forces instructor

193
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,315
And a simple family man. One day
he takes his wife and kids for a picnic

194
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:30,388
And by chance or fate,
depending on which you believe in,

195
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:32,894
they witnessed a mob execution.

196
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,101
When they were discovered.

197
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,612
Castle survived.

198
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:47,331
Since then, he's been taking down
one crime family after another.

199
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:53,912
I'm really close, Budiansky

200
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:57,122
The only thing getting
in my way is some bad luck.

201
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:00,931
But I have a feeling
that's about to change.

202
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:04,245
You know, I've
been waiting for someone like you.

203
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:08,184
Take a look at some of the case files.

204
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,730
Get the lay of land. I'll get us a pie
from Melanos. Best pizza in the city

205
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:15,404
With drawer?
-What?

206
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:17,601
The alleged Punisher murders.

207
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:20,751
All of them.

208
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:00,082
What do you want, Micro?

209
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:03,290
You ever heard of Jahadiblogger.com?

210
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,926
I'm posing as a one-arm Wahabi warrior
who took a crap in a cave next to bin Laden.

211
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:11,042
I think I can score you a couple of rocket launchers.

212
00:26:11,042 --> 00:26:12,568
What do you want?

213
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:15,676
I haven't seen you in a while.

214
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,859
I brought you some treats.
It's gun show season in Virginia

215
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:23,900
No background checks, no problems.

216
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:29,621
That's too much Frank.

217
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,092
Call it a retirement package.

218
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:38,571
Look I know this thing with the Fed is eating you
up inside but that doesn't mean that you pack up your tent.

219
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,603
We all make the mistakes Frank.

220
00:26:40,781 --> 00:26:42,152
You are fighting a war...

221
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:46,595
against the assholes who slip through
the raindrops. Who get away with it.

222
00:26:46,595 --> 00:26:49,124
In any war there is collateral damage.
You know that.

223
00:26:49,636 --> 00:26:51,539
Collateral damage?

224
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,855
I killed an agent in the field.
One of the good guys.

225
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:03,530
He had a family.

226
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:05,331
You didn't know.

227
00:27:07,948 --> 00:27:09,782
I fucked up Micro.

228
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,258
Now please, just leave me alone.

229
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,146
Where the fuck is Nicky?

230
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:41,425
He didn't make it.
-Nicky was a fucking rat.

231
00:27:41,797 --> 00:27:43,130
For the Feds.

232
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:46,699
What about my money?

233
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:50,350
We already went
to his place and tore it apart.

234
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,722
No sign of the safety deposit key or nothing.

235
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:54,989
Does he got any next of kin?

236
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:57,928
Somebody to carry
on the family name?

237
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,897
Yeah. Paper said something
about a wife and a little girl.

238
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:04,441
Good. Let's look there.
- You got it.

239
00:28:05,722 --> 00:28:08,161
Hey, Buck! Where you been?

240
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:09,758
Am I glad to see you.
- Hi Billy.

241
00:28:09,808 --> 00:28:12,873
You should have seen those
fucking brashules at the clinic.

242
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:16,003
They must have bought their
fucking degrees off of the internet.

243
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:18,018
How the heck did you end up at a free clinic?

244
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:20,357
Insurance said I missed a payment.

245
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:22,162
Can you fucking believe that?

246
00:28:22,162 --> 00:28:25,871
Yeah, before we do this,
I need you to understand.

247
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,042
The severity of your injuries
when you arrived here.

248
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:30,649
Statistically speaking you
shouldn't have been able to survive this.

249
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:32,754
Well that's why I'm here, Doc.

250
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:35,628
I have the best plastic surgeon
in all of New York.

251
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:42,076
Your facial muscles, tendons,
bone structure, everything - it was destroyed.

252
00:28:42,076 --> 00:28:44,316
There wasn't a single
square inch of skin

253
00:28:44,316 --> 00:28:45,452
left intact.

254
00:28:45,452 --> 00:28:48,091
Just take it off already.

255
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:50,723
Ok, let's do this.

256
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:55,338
Now I need you to sit
forward a little bit.

257
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:56,636
Alright.

258
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:01,891
Ok!

259
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:05,592
Polymers

260
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:14,279
strategically placed alloy plates,

261
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:20,034
And just a little bit of horse hide.

262
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,235
A little what?

263
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,338
I need to talk to my doctor alone.

264
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:38,745
Yeah, of course, Billy.

265
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:46,100
What the fuck's the matter with you?

266
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,737
You can't fuckin' control yourself?

267
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:49,842
You know how sensitive
he is about his looks.

268
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:54,752
Sorry Pops, it's just that I've never
seen anything so...  -Just shut the fuck up!

269
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,259
You ok boss?

270
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,087
Much better, thanks.

271
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,426
I'll be in the car.

272
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,729
No more distractions.

273
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:54,533
We need to focus on my goals.

274
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:56,002
One.

275
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,633
We need to get my money back.

276
00:30:58,878 --> 00:31:01,049
Two. We gonna get rid of Frank Castle.

277
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:02,853
Well...

278
00:31:02,853 --> 00:31:04,357
He took out like 30 of us. I mean-

279
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:07,698
How are we gonna kill him
before he'll kill us?

280
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,235
My brother will take care of that.

281
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:11,469
Loony Bin Jim?
-Shut the fuck up.

282
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:14,379
His name is James.

283
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,420
Not Loony Bin Jim.

284
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,762
Not LBJ, James.
-I'm sorry.

285
00:31:19,762 --> 00:31:22,929
It was a good idea Really, It is.

286
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,208
Don't mind him.

287
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,046
He doesn't think before he talks.

288
00:31:27,046 --> 00:31:29,117
Just like his mother.

289
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:31,223
Sorry about that Billy.

290
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,528
Billy is dead.

291
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:38,234
From now on, you call me Jigsaw.

292
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:10,629
How are we doing today,
Loony Bin Jim?

293
00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:25,123
Yummy yummy.

294
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:31,582
So good.

295
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:35,827
What?

296
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:37,464
Doctor Basner. Open up.

297
00:33:37,464 --> 00:33:38,956
Yes, doctor.

298
00:33:58,749 --> 00:34:00,275
Billy?

299
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:02,385
Is that you?

300
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:06,861
It is.

301
00:34:07,604 --> 00:34:10,544
You look fantastic, brother.

302
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:19,497
Ink, cut these off. Now.

303
00:34:20,335 --> 00:34:23,365
Pittsy, go open the doors of every other cell.

304
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:25,347
Lead everybody out at the front door.

305
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:28,377
Sure thing, Billy... Jigsaw.

306
00:34:29,992 --> 00:34:31,757
I'll take care of this guy.

307
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:36,931
Oh no brother. Fatso is mine.

308
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:39,012
Of course.

309
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:45,654
I'm gonna get my apple sauce back.

310
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,802
Did you know...

311
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:52,803
Kidneys in apple sauce are
a delicacy in Sweden?

312
00:34:54,352 --> 00:34:57,815
Did you know that? Yes.

313
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:05,138
Yummy yummy yummy,
in my tummy tummy tummy.

314
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:15,493
What do ya say boss?

315
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:17,106
Stuff might come in handy.

316
00:35:17,106 --> 00:35:18,176
What for?

317
00:35:18,176 --> 00:35:22,016
Well, in case he starts,
you know, not feeling so good.

318
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,701
He's doing just great.

319
00:36:03,654 --> 00:36:05,123
You're in my light.

320
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,552
For the next time someone
gets in your light.

321
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,387
Stay the fuck away from my little girl.

322
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:34,657
Mom! That's a bad word.
-Go inside, Grace.

323
00:36:39,474 --> 00:36:42,812
You're messing with the wrong family
on the wrong day, asshole.

324
00:36:46,157 --> 00:36:48,891
You... You are...

325
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,738
What are you doing here?

326
00:36:51,738 --> 00:36:54,043
What makes you think you can come here?

327
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:56,416
You scared the girl.
-Shut up.

328
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,352
Just shut your mouth.

329
00:36:59,858 --> 00:37:02,022
I'm sorry.
-I said shut up.

330
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:06,731
What's this?

331
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:10,140
Something to help out.
-No.

332
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:12,921
No, you don't get to do that.

333
00:37:13,157 --> 00:37:16,064
You don't get to shoot my husband
in cold blood...

334
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:17,400
and did stuff with the ATM.

335
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,894
It's for your daughter.

336
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:22,136
This is what you deserve.

337
00:37:23,181 --> 00:37:25,619
What you did to Nicky.

338
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:31,663
Who punishes you?

339
00:37:34,274 --> 00:37:36,142
He taught you how to shoot.

340
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,781
Good agent keeps his family safe.

341
00:37:40,189 --> 00:37:41,886
He couldn't always be here.

342
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:46,467
Took the out to the range.

343
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,641
Showed you what to do.

344
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:54,251
This... is where you do it.

345
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,261
Squeeze.

346
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,362
Don't pull.

347
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:14,839
I can't find my red pen.

348
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:20,683
Mom? I need it.

349
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,900
Take it.

350
00:39:13,115 --> 00:39:15,345
Is this it boss?
- Yeah.

351
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:17,180
Nice brother.

352
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:19,431
Is it yours?

353
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:20,100
Not yet.

354
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,731
Ol' Cesare used to
rent it to screw hookers

355
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:26,313
Let's go inside before I freeze
my fucking balls off.

356
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:46,290
What's the matter, Billy?

357
00:39:47,266 --> 00:39:52,472
Just when I think I'm Ok
I see my reflection somewhere and ...

358
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,250
I look horrible.

359
00:39:58,726 --> 00:40:00,663
What has he done to me?

360
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:05,577
Oh no... don't cry, brother.

361
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:08,317
Everything is gonna be alright.

362
00:40:08,317 --> 00:40:11,558
I promise you two things.

363
00:40:11,558 --> 00:40:15,601
One, I will find Castle and
I will kill him.

364
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:18,942
Slowly and painfully.

365
00:40:18,942 --> 00:40:26,127
And two, you will never ever have to
look at your reflection again,

366
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:28,496
as long as you're with me.

367
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,785
- Speaking in Russian -

368
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:38,367
You're not in Transylvania anymore Cristu.

369
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,975
We don't talk vampire.

370
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:43,915
It's Russian,...

371
00:41:45,554 --> 00:41:48,127
My men is concerned.

372
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:50,759
If Punisher can do this to your face,

373
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:53,807
what might he do to our deal?

374
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:57,509
The tongue stretches further than
most people think.

375
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:01,257
Ask your man how he's gonna talk
that shit,

376
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:03,498
when I pull it from his mouth.

377
00:42:03,498 --> 00:42:05,024
Or you'll what?

378
00:42:06,271 --> 00:42:07,875
Enough!

379
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,980
The Punisher is not a problem.

380
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,848
The docks are mine.

381
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:14,788
My looks have nothing to do with this.

382
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,358
Everybody.

383
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:20,836
From local security to international
customs is in my pocket.

384
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:25,882
Quite frankly. This job doesn't get done
without me.

385
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,782
What do you think?

386
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:32,762
It seems he is right.

387
00:42:33,237 --> 00:42:34,968
We do not need monster.

388
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:40,586
Shit!

389
00:42:50,378 --> 00:42:52,315
Stop!

390
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:09,859
My most sincere apologies.

391
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:13,562
My father always say never insult
your host.

392
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:16,574
Sounds like a reasonable man.

393
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,944
You don't know my father.

394
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:28,327
Three days.

395
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,970
It has to be 12 million.

396
00:43:33,985 --> 00:43:36,924
We agreed on 10.
- We both know ...

397
00:43:37,093 --> 00:43:41,126
that this biological shit you're
bringing in isn't leaving the city.

398
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:45,813
You're selling it to the ragheads
in Queens.

399
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:48,453
The ports been crawling with suits
from Homeland.

400
00:43:48,453 --> 00:43:51,689
It's going to take a lot of payola
to keep it quiet.

401
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,391
I always knew you'd be a good boss, Billy

402
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:06,992
Thanks brother.

403
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:50,661
Latin kings.

404
00:44:51,006 --> 00:44:53,244
Let him go, Frank.

405
00:44:53,244 --> 00:44:55,249
You know this piece of shit?

406
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:57,783
Ex piece of shit.
-Yeah.

407
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,296
He's a regular choir boy.

408
00:45:00,426 --> 00:45:02,379
Fuck you, cracker.
-Language!

409
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:04,038
It's a genius racket.

410
00:45:04,158 --> 00:45:06,876
You know how the cops are
always running those guns buy backs?

411
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:08,748
Except they never work.

412
00:45:08,864 --> 00:45:12,481
Because what banger
is gonna trust a cop, right?

413
00:45:13,595 --> 00:45:17,203
Well, these drive by whack jobs,
they just love Carlos here.

414
00:45:17,203 --> 00:45:21,509
They get one look at that lnk,
and they know he's for real.

415
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,624
We get the guns of the streets to you

416
00:45:25,624 --> 00:45:29,496
Never once seen a banger that could quit.
Too fucking stupid.

417
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:32,902
He's straight, Frank.

418
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:38,348
Hey ma! Frank's here.
He says eat up.

419
00:45:40,226 --> 00:45:41,752
How is she doing?

420
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,403
Yeah well...

421
00:45:44,403 --> 00:45:48,209
As long as she's got her cooking shows,
she's good.

422
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:51,413
It's the only thing she notices.

423
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,785
But hey that's something, right?

424
00:45:57,601 --> 00:45:58,193
Listen. I-

425
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:02,779
I just came around to tell you I'm
going out of town for a while.

426
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:03,973
Out of town?

427
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,102
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

428
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:15,272
I never thought of the Punisher, you know
taking a long weekend.

429
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:17,382
I'm not planning on coming back.

430
00:46:18,486 --> 00:46:21,418
So I take it things didn't go so well
at the Donatelli home.

431
00:46:23,264 --> 00:46:25,132
Are you aware that Billy Russoti survived?

432
00:46:27,374 --> 00:46:28,570
I heard.

433
00:46:30,014 --> 00:46:32,821
Let the cops take care of him.

434
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:35,310
You and I know they got nothing on him.

435
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:36,663
Their hands are tied.

436
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:38,335
This is where the Punisher comes in.

437
00:46:38,385 --> 00:46:41,533
This is why I believe in you.
Why I've supported you all these years.

438
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:43,145
You want me to tell you when
something happens to...

439
00:46:43,185 --> 00:46:44,645
Mrs. Donatelli and her daughter?

440
00:46:44,715 --> 00:46:46,855
Because that's what's gonna happen.

441
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:48,793
You don't think he's gonna go
for revenge?

442
00:46:48,803 --> 00:46:51,153
It's not a question of if.
it's just a matter of when.

443
00:47:02,025 --> 00:47:04,155
Pull a couple of Berettas.
-For what?

444
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:09,768
3, 2, 1

445
00:47:13,854 --> 00:47:15,792
Russoti is the last one.

446
00:47:15,992 --> 00:47:16,927
Then I'm done.

447
00:47:17,027 --> 00:47:18,532
For your own lips to God's ears.

448
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,802
You know where I can find him.

449
00:47:19,862 --> 00:47:21,974
I don't have a fix on him.

450
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:24,915
You wiped out all of his associates
that are known to me.

451
00:47:24,915 --> 00:47:27,655
I saw him with some new guys.
The leader was black.

452
00:47:27,655 --> 00:47:29,091
Dreadlocks.

453
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:31,425
Doing some kind of acrobatic
stuff over the roofs.

454
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:33,769
That's Maginty and his
Urban Freeflow Gang.

455
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,507
He's a mean motherfucker.

456
00:47:35,507 --> 00:47:37,607
He's on a constant meth high.

457
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:46,598
Well come on.

458
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:49,038
You want to find this guy or not?

459
00:47:52,882 --> 00:47:54,682
You boys play nice.

460
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:05,714
I've been looking for you.

461
00:48:05,714 --> 00:48:08,151
Agent Budiansky. Take a load off.

462
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:09,857
I need to go see Castle.

463
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:12,698
Where do I find him?
-Brats, you know.

464
00:48:12,798 --> 00:48:13,490
He just left.

465
00:48:14,936 --> 00:48:16,667
Wait...

466
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:18,304
You know what I like to do.

467
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:24,790
I like to sit in my car and listen
to the CB Radio and follow the crime.

468
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:28,202
I might just run into him.

469
00:48:28,202 --> 00:48:30,207
It's never worked for me
in five years now.

470
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,180
But I'm not the luckiest guy
on the planet, you know.

471
00:48:49,053 --> 00:48:50,853
Let's get through the back door.

472
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:10,465
Maginty and his boys are planning to hit
a convenience store of 45th and 2nd.

473
00:49:27,854 --> 00:49:29,616
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

474
00:49:29,796 --> 00:49:32,912
I repeat.
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

475
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:35,021
Let's do this.

476
00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:37,904
Really?

477
00:49:38,573 --> 00:49:39,967
Just drive the car.

478
00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:43,986
Come on! Run!

479
00:50:18,001 --> 00:50:19,203
Oh fuck!

480
00:50:34,613 --> 00:50:35,813
Please

481
00:50:36,014 --> 00:50:37,350
Don't kill me.

482
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,555
Russoti, where is he?

483
00:50:39,555 --> 00:50:41,993
Yeah Jigsaw, I was just with him.

484
00:50:42,095 --> 00:50:44,367
He was suppose to give us some
dope for a job.

485
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:45,961
But it turns out...

486
00:50:47,307 --> 00:50:49,210
He don't have any anymore.

487
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:53,388
He forgot. He botched it.
He be a bastard.

488
00:50:54,024 --> 00:50:56,931
So you wanna go see him,
you need to tell him this,

489
00:50:56,931 --> 00:50:58,663
Wee bitch. Take it back.

490
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,013
So tell him, for something,
Mr. Punisher, sir.

491
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:12,202
So when did Donatelli
go undercover?

492
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,340
We were partners in narcotics.

493
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,477
Unfortunately,

494
00:51:15,537 --> 00:51:17,538
most of the blow we confiscated.

495
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:18,912
ended up in my nose.

496
00:51:19,585 --> 00:51:22,060
Internal Affairs tried to
get Nicky to rat me out.

497
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,327
He wouldn't.

498
00:51:23,387 --> 00:51:25,596
So, they sent him undercover.

499
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:29,572
He's dead because of me.

500
00:51:32,585 --> 00:51:34,384
So you still skiing the old Alps?

501
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:38,491
No. That's in the past.

502
00:51:43,577 --> 00:51:45,471
Holy shit!

503
00:51:56,878 --> 00:51:59,578
I'm getting out.
You meet me on the other side.

504
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,145
Boo.

505
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:31,258
Hello, Mrs. Donatelli.

506
00:52:31,629 --> 00:52:32,999
Or will you be calling
yourself 'miss' from now on.

507
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:35,605
What do you want from us?

508
00:52:35,605 --> 00:52:37,677
I'm looking for my money.

509
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:39,648
Which your rat of a husband
stole from me.

510
00:52:39,748 --> 00:52:41,740
But we don't have it. I swear to God.

511
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,601
How about you, sweet cheeks?

512
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:50,372
Would you also like to swear
on an imaginary friend?

513
00:52:53,382 --> 00:52:55,320
Make sure they don't move.

514
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,718
I'll look for the money.
-Come here kid.

515
00:53:02,337 --> 00:53:03,607
Freeze, asshole.

516
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:05,871
You're under arrest.

517
00:53:23,221 --> 00:53:25,124
Stay out of my way.

518
00:54:16,618 --> 00:54:17,787
Listen to me.

519
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:21,121
Russoti is headed to the Donatelli house.

520
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:22,961
He's probably already there.

521
00:54:24,037 --> 00:54:26,007
You have to let me go.

522
00:54:26,007 --> 00:54:28,673
You have the right to shut the fuck up.

523
00:55:25,386 --> 00:55:27,825
Good evening, officers.

524
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,031
Is everything Ok in there?

525
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:34,907
No. Everything is not Ok.
Follow me.

526
00:55:43,931 --> 00:55:46,129
Officer.

527
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,102
No you don't!

528
00:56:03,077 --> 00:56:05,082
Well...

529
00:56:05,082 --> 00:56:08,318
This day was about to come sooner
or later, wasn't it?

530
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:12,793
Have you heard back from the patrol car?

531
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,310
So...

532
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,574
I tried it a couple times.

533
00:56:19,016 --> 00:56:20,349
There was no answer.

534
00:56:29,408 --> 00:56:30,177
Listen.

535
00:56:30,177 --> 00:56:32,945
We gotta get out of here before
more pigs arrive.

536
00:56:34,822 --> 00:56:36,292
Where is my fuckin' money?

537
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,329
My husband has a safe upstairs
in the bedroom.

538
00:56:38,505 --> 00:56:40,970
I don't know if it's there but
I can give you the combination.

539
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,964
10-12-1965

540
00:56:43,342 --> 00:56:45,114
Oh how cute.

541
00:56:45,114 --> 00:56:47,312
Is that your dead husband's birthday?

542
00:56:58,814 --> 00:57:01,342
Let me out here.

543
00:57:07,903 --> 00:57:10,033
Get him to the station.
-You bet.

544
00:57:28,252 --> 00:57:29,210
Let me out.

545
00:57:31,524 --> 00:57:33,464
You know, Frank.

546
00:57:33,464 --> 00:57:36,029
Throwing your tip now and then
is one thing.

547
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:39,871
Password to the crime database, sure,
but letting you go, so-

548
00:57:41,151 --> 00:57:42,049
Fine.

549
00:57:54,015 --> 00:57:55,348
How you doing?

550
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,123
19.

551
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,544
What was that?

552
00:58:36,418 --> 00:58:37,176
Go check it out.

553
00:58:39,993 --> 00:58:42,296
What the fuck you waiting for? Christmas?

554
00:59:10,635 --> 00:59:11,069
Now.

555
00:59:11,069 --> 00:59:13,240
Now, you sit down.

556
00:59:22,363 --> 00:59:23,023
I'm calling this in.

557
00:59:24,235 --> 00:59:24,998
Put your hands behind your back.

558
00:59:29,414 --> 00:59:31,782
Goddamnit you asshole!

559
00:59:33,424 --> 00:59:35,292
Where do you think you're going?

560
00:59:36,697 --> 00:59:38,695
Hands up!

561
00:59:42,847 --> 00:59:44,340
I repeat,
Request immediate back up.

562
00:59:52,669 --> 00:59:54,976
Don't worry. I'm here.

563
00:59:54,976 --> 00:59:56,844
Give me your fucking gun.

564
01:00:01,493 --> 01:00:03,828
Stay right where you fucking are.

565
01:00:07,674 --> 01:00:08,140
We did it, Budiansky, huh?

566
01:00:09,913 --> 01:00:11,812
You mind explaining it to me...

567
01:00:11,918 --> 01:00:15,527
how a handcuffed criminal escapes custody
the back of your locked car?

568
01:00:15,937 --> 01:00:19,259
The Castle is a slippery one.

569
01:00:32,468 --> 01:00:34,530
You'll be safe here.

570
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:36,576
We can manage on our own.

571
01:00:36,718 --> 01:00:38,279
Just until we know Russoti's
been arrested.

572
01:00:43,228 --> 01:00:45,633
Grace.

573
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:47,901
Grace, you listen, honey.

574
01:00:49,443 --> 01:00:50,969
She's smart.

575
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,852
Go ahead. Open it.

576
01:01:25,531 --> 01:01:27,194
It... belonged to my daughter.

577
01:01:29,874 --> 01:01:30,503
Here.

578
01:01:37,526 --> 01:01:39,789
Wow!

579
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,290
Put that down, honey.

580
01:01:57,442 --> 01:02:03,957
This was... Lisa's favorite toy.

581
01:02:03,957 --> 01:02:07,299
She got so angry when her little
brother used to hide it from her.

582
01:02:07,299 --> 01:02:11,070
Does she care if I play with it?

583
01:02:11,443 --> 01:02:13,778
No.

584
01:02:32,093 --> 01:02:35,032
You gonna fry for killing
two of my officers, Billy.

585
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,230
I want a lawyer.
- Oh, you'll get your fucking lawyer.

586
01:02:38,977 --> 01:02:40,947
No lawyer's going to get
you out of this one.

587
01:02:41,282 --> 01:02:43,219
Lousy piece of shit.

588
01:03:00,896 --> 01:03:03,970
Agent Miller.
What are you doing here?

589
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,006
Russoti.

590
01:03:05,006 --> 01:03:06,811
What's he gotta do with the Bureau?

591
01:03:06,861 --> 01:03:08,180
The case Donatelli was
working on.

592
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,882
He says he got some intel to
make a deal for.

593
01:03:12,057 --> 01:03:13,293
Anyone know where he is right now?

594
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:15,198
They just brought him
into the observation room.

595
01:03:15,198 --> 01:03:15,962
Good.

596
01:03:19,073 --> 01:03:19,942
Yeah.

597
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:21,814
Captain Ross. Agent Miller with the Bureau.

598
01:03:21,834 --> 01:03:25,282
I believe you've been informed
I'll be taking over this.

599
01:03:27,662 --> 01:03:31,104
This perp killed two of my officers.

600
01:03:31,104 --> 01:03:34,344
And terrorized a widow and child
of one of your agents.

601
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:35,974
You keep that in mind, Miller.

602
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:45,004
You're lucky I came to you with this.

603
01:03:45,004 --> 01:03:47,841
But then I'm a patriot just like you.

604
01:03:49,348 --> 01:03:51,085
I shit red white and blue.

605
01:03:51,085 --> 01:03:52,723
The reason you came to me is
because you got caught.

606
01:03:52,723 --> 01:03:56,131
So don't insult my intelligence, Ok?

607
01:03:56,131 --> 01:03:57,333
You tell me what you know.

608
01:03:57,363 --> 01:03:59,339
If it's any good,

609
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:02,176
I'll recommend life without parole.

610
01:04:03,515 --> 01:04:06,044
This deal is going down tonight?

611
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,067
I know when and I know where.

612
01:04:12,471 --> 01:04:18,076
So you're gonna give me and my brother
the immunity and the money.

613
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:20,847
Or you're gonna have to explain
to Wolf fucking Blitzer...

614
01:04:22,061 --> 01:04:26,471
why you had a lead on the thing
that killed half of the fucking city,

615
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:28,705
and you didn't do
a goddamn thing about it.

616
01:04:33,455 --> 01:04:35,527
I'll be right back.

617
01:04:35,527 --> 01:04:37,532
Oh and Miller.

618
01:04:37,532 --> 01:04:39,298
Just that one other little thing.

619
01:05:42,931 --> 01:05:44,631
Wow!

620
01:05:45,732 --> 01:05:47,292
Happy?

621
01:06:02,238 --> 01:06:04,437
Shit! You bastard.

622
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,515
You're fucking dead men.

623
01:06:06,615 --> 01:06:08,883
My father will kill you.
Hear me?

624
01:06:09,723 --> 01:06:12,389
My father will serve your head
on a fucking silver platter!

625
01:06:17,777 --> 01:06:19,406
Agent Miller.

626
01:06:19,715 --> 01:06:21,252
It's agreed.

627
01:06:21,252 --> 01:06:23,154
The other conditions of our agreement?

628
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:26,497
Clear the area.

629
01:06:28,102 --> 01:06:31,802
I hope to God he finds you,
and you get what you deserve.

630
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,130
How long was l-

631
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:55,635
A long time.

632
01:06:55,635 --> 01:06:56,905
You should eat.

633
01:06:56,905 --> 01:06:58,542
Yuck!
-Grace.

634
01:06:58,542 --> 01:06:59,578
What is it?

635
01:06:59,578 --> 01:07:01,450
Egg and cheese MREs.

636
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,318
That's all I have.

637
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:03,789
What's an MRE?

638
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:06,796
Meal. Ready to eat.

639
01:07:06,796 --> 01:07:07,964
Military food.

640
01:07:08,014 --> 01:07:10,439
It's great for people who can't cook.

641
01:07:10,439 --> 01:07:13,810
Look, Grace.
This is gonna come with chuckles.

642
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,383
It's the best one I got.

643
01:07:16,553 --> 01:07:17,989
Not exactly a balanced breakfast.

644
01:07:17,989 --> 01:07:20,689
Out of practice.

645
01:07:22,301 --> 01:07:25,833
Not one more step.

646
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,759
Where's Micro?

647
01:07:32,809 --> 01:07:33,860
His mother isn't feeling well.

648
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:34,930
He didn't want to leave her.

649
01:07:34,945 --> 01:07:35,665
Damn it.

650
01:07:35,695 --> 01:07:38,002
I need to talk to him.

651
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:39,308
This is Carlos.

652
01:07:39,308 --> 01:07:42,247
He's... a friend of mine.

653
01:07:43,652 --> 01:07:46,524
He's gonna hang while I
take care of some things.

654
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,832
Hi Carlos. I'm Grace.

655
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:50,101
Hey little darling.

656
01:07:50,131 --> 01:07:51,602
We're gonna be homies, right?

657
01:07:52,842 --> 01:07:55,047
Yeah. we're gonna be tight.

658
01:07:55,047 --> 01:07:56,380
This all will be over soon.

659
01:07:57,587 --> 01:07:59,523
Then you can go.

660
01:08:06,575 --> 01:08:07,601
Don't go.

661
01:08:23,817 --> 01:08:25,788
I need you alert.

662
01:08:27,058 --> 01:08:28,892
Don't make me regret this.

663
01:08:38,754 --> 01:08:40,587
That was fun.

664
01:08:40,959 --> 01:08:45,002
Now let's go kill Castle and
his miserable whore.

665
01:08:45,002 --> 01:08:46,939
No, not yet.

666
01:08:47,141 --> 01:08:49,841
We're gonna have ourselves
a little fun with this.

667
01:08:50,014 --> 01:08:52,654
Next time he has to face us
and a fucking army.

668
01:08:52,654 --> 01:08:54,591
Where do we get the army from?

669
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,766
Just like Uncle Sam, bro.

670
01:08:57,766 --> 01:09:00,673
We recruit in troubled neighborhoods.

671
01:09:00,673 --> 01:09:04,115
Offer a hundred grand towards
a college education they'll never get.

672
01:09:04,115 --> 01:09:07,055
Promise nobody ever has to
go to Iraq.

673
01:09:08,192 --> 01:09:10,430
Just as long as I get to kill Castle.

674
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,603
Don't worry brother. You will.

675
01:09:12,603 --> 01:09:15,808
Just making damn sure this time
he don't come back breathing.

676
01:10:00,385 --> 01:10:01,786
Hold it.

677
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:08,897
Hello sportsfans.

678
01:10:16,157 --> 01:10:18,396
How are you today my friend?

679
01:10:18,396 --> 01:10:20,234
Run! Get out of here!

680
01:10:20,234 --> 01:10:24,776
Hey! I axed you a question.
- Run!

681
01:10:27,686 --> 01:10:28,619
You don't answer.

682
01:10:29,523 --> 01:10:32,588
Guess I'll have to ask it again.

683
01:10:34,736 --> 01:10:35,869
Here I come.

684
01:11:17,675 --> 01:11:19,372
Good.

685
01:11:20,047 --> 01:11:21,141
Bring them upstairs.

686
01:11:21,483 --> 01:11:22,383
Meet me back down here.

687
01:11:23,255 --> 01:11:26,292
I'll see if we can talk a few
poor bastards into signing up.

688
01:11:34,716 --> 01:11:35,942
Where are they?

689
01:11:43,203 --> 01:11:45,509
I shout. I swear I shout.

690
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:48,573
Goddamnit! Don't die on me.

691
01:11:50,221 --> 01:11:51,591
I'm bleeding out.

692
01:11:51,591 --> 01:11:53,161
I seen this shit before.

693
01:11:53,161 --> 01:11:55,598
Shut up kid. You're gonna be fine.

694
01:11:56,436 --> 01:11:58,805
It hurts real bad.
Hurts real bad, Frank.

695
01:12:01,314 --> 01:12:03,686
Don't let me die like this, man.

696
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,280
Not like this.

697
01:12:16,317 --> 01:12:17,616
See you in hell.

698
01:12:18,322 --> 01:12:22,094
I see you anywhere near hell,
I'll kick your ass out.

699
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:49,658
I haven't seen you in ages, Frank.

700
01:12:50,635 --> 01:12:53,300
Whatever it is, it must be pretty bad.

701
01:12:53,575 --> 01:12:55,635
Maybe I'm just here to see an old friend, Mike.

702
01:12:56,348 --> 01:12:58,019
Yeah right. I haven't seen you since-

703
01:12:58,109 --> 01:12:59,981
The funeral. I know.

704
01:13:02,397 --> 01:13:04,299
I've been reading about you.

705
01:13:04,568 --> 01:13:07,507
You've been a long way from
the seminary, my friend.

706
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:11,744
I don't even remember
that as part of my life.

707
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:13,446
Why do you do this?

708
01:13:15,328 --> 01:13:17,259
Somebody has to punish the corrupt.

709
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,376
For in the same way you judge others,
you will be judged.

710
01:13:21,376 --> 01:13:25,819
And with the measure you use,
it will be measured to you.

711
01:13:27,758 --> 01:13:29,125
Matthew. 72.

712
01:13:32,536 --> 01:13:33,196
I'm Ok with that.

713
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:36,979
God be with you, Frank.

714
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:47,436
Sometimes I'd like to get
my hands on God.

715
01:14:01,374 --> 01:14:03,003
Interesting choice for a meeting place.

716
01:14:03,378 --> 01:14:05,612
Didn't take you for a religious man,
Castle.

717
01:14:06,352 --> 01:14:09,484
Yeah well. An eye for an eye.

718
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:12,826
If I remember right, they are
not called the Ten Suggestions.

719
01:14:13,835 --> 01:14:16,069
Russoti's got Angela and Grace.

720
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,913
How?-
Doesn't matter.

721
01:14:18,965 --> 01:14:21,721
Or maybe if you put her in protective
custody like you should've...

722
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:24,353
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

723
01:14:24,454 --> 01:14:26,054
They'd be dead.

724
01:14:26,702 --> 01:14:28,401
The law can't touch them, Castle.

725
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:31,003
Total immunity.

726
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,749
Unless you got a video tape of
Russoti taking them.

727
01:14:35,924 --> 01:14:37,622
Can't even give him a parking ticket.

728
01:14:38,062 --> 01:14:40,261
It's a fucked up system you're
sworn to protect.

729
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:42,698
I never said it was perfect.

730
01:14:43,842 --> 01:14:45,740
He wants me in
exchange for them.

731
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:50,018
I need you to secure the trade.

732
01:14:50,659 --> 01:14:52,122
Ok.

733
01:14:53,099 --> 01:14:54,871
But I'm doing this by the book.

734
01:14:54,871 --> 01:14:57,673
What book do you think
they're going by huh?

735
01:14:58,045 --> 01:14:59,879
I took an oath, Castle.

736
01:15:00,718 --> 01:15:02,978
There are laws.
-No official police procedure.

737
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,826
You wanna come along?

738
01:15:05,998 --> 01:15:07,327
Leave your badge at home.

739
01:15:11,812 --> 01:15:13,172
I have to think about it.

740
01:15:13,282 --> 01:15:14,607
The clock's ticking.

741
01:15:37,308 --> 01:15:38,276
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

742
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,174
Relax.

743
01:15:40,849 --> 01:15:43,447
We're looking for a few good man.

744
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:47,332
And we'd like to offer you
the opportunity...

745
01:15:47,332 --> 01:15:50,605
to be all that you can be.

746
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:53,780
Now we've all suffered loss,

747
01:15:53,808 --> 01:15:56,712
at the hands of the Punisher.

748
01:15:58,058 --> 01:16:01,065
And because we don't look like
everybody else,

749
01:16:01,165 --> 01:16:04,038
and because we don't act like
everybody else,

750
01:16:05,275 --> 01:16:07,437
nobody does a goddamn thing about it.

751
01:16:08,851 --> 01:16:13,727
Well I say, he ain't the only one who can
take the war into his own hands.

752
01:16:14,431 --> 01:16:19,811
So if you're as sick of this
cocksucker as I am,

753
01:16:19,811 --> 01:16:21,883
raise your armies.

754
01:16:21,883 --> 01:16:22,578
You'll be well paid.

755
01:16:24,823 --> 01:16:25,951
You'll be well armed.

756
01:16:27,797 --> 01:16:31,705
And at the end of it, the Punisher
will be dead.

757
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:51,434
Agent Budiansky.

758
01:17:51,534 --> 01:17:52,602
Just in time for happy hour.

759
01:17:53,806 --> 01:17:55,532
You need to come with me.

760
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,240
Where to?

761
01:17:57,348 --> 01:17:58,681
Your partner, Frank Castle.

762
01:17:58,718 --> 01:18:00,450
He needs help.

763
01:18:02,461 --> 01:18:04,796
Partner is a little bit
of an exaggeration.

764
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:07,130
How did you know?

765
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,169
Usually unless you've arrested Houdini.

766
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:13,211
A handcuffed criminal does
not escape that easily.

767
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,152
You know you're not as stupid as you-

768
01:18:15,653 --> 01:18:16,853
I didn't say that.

769
01:18:20,037 --> 01:18:21,707
Who are we looking for?

770
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:22,803
Cristu's father.

771
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:28,086
I don't think this is a good idea.

772
01:18:38,483 --> 01:18:39,644
What?

773
01:18:40,386 --> 01:18:42,056
We're looking for Tiberiu,
Cristu father.

774
01:18:46,135 --> 01:18:47,160
Why?

775
01:18:47,605 --> 01:18:48,440
If I were to Tiberiu,

776
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:52,348
I'd probably wanna find the man who was
responsible for sending my son to prison,

777
01:18:53,085 --> 01:18:53,848
for the rest of his life.

778
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:55,950
And how would you do that?

779
01:18:56,025 --> 01:18:58,328
I tell him when and where to find him.

780
01:18:58,799 --> 01:19:02,567
What do you want from me?

781
01:19:02,607 --> 01:19:05,706
I don't like him.
I want him taken care of.

782
01:19:08,322 --> 01:19:11,261
No worries my friend.

783
01:20:07,535 --> 01:20:08,735
Here they are.

784
01:20:08,936 --> 01:20:10,633
Oh boy!

785
01:20:44,291 --> 01:20:47,585
Take it easy James.
He'll be here.

786
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,680
You get it.
- Fuck that, you get it!

787
01:20:54,381 --> 01:20:55,776
I'll get it.

788
01:20:58,858 --> 01:20:59,793
What you looking for?

789
01:20:59,893 --> 01:21:04,261
I'm here to see the Jigsaw.
- You out of luck. No Jigsaw here.

790
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:08,773
I'm here, for the Punisher party.

791
01:21:18,339 --> 01:21:22,213
Who is the old man?
That's Critu's father.

792
01:21:24,487 --> 01:21:26,792
Old country genocidal maniac.

793
01:21:26,792 --> 01:21:29,466
Figured he'd stir up a shitstorm for us.

794
01:21:29,466 --> 01:21:32,907
Cops will be all over this place
once the fireworks start.

795
01:21:33,676 --> 01:21:36,240
I wouldn't worry about that,
I called in a explosives permit.

796
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:40,783
Consruction. Said we'd be
blasting dynamite all night

797
01:21:41,562 --> 01:21:44,503
So, what's the plan?

798
01:21:44,503 --> 01:21:46,200
I going in to get them.

799
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,918
You call that a plan.

800
01:21:50,918 --> 01:21:52,114
It's all I've made.

801
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:55,889
Well I'm going with you.

802
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:03,148
I never took the time
to think about where I was headed.

803
01:22:03,148 --> 01:22:05,449
I'm far down that road.

804
01:22:07,392 --> 01:22:09,385
You're not going there.

805
01:22:10,299 --> 01:22:12,736
Thanks Frank.

806
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:15,370
You know he's going to take it
out on me when he wakes up.

807
01:22:16,748 --> 01:22:19,448
You don't hear gunfire for
longer than 5 minutes

808
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:22,924
Then the girls are not here.

809
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:24,558
Set him loose.

810
01:26:02,098 --> 01:26:02,688
It's time.

811
01:26:03,805 --> 01:26:05,599
James, be careful.

812
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:55,552
Oh for fuck sake!

813
01:27:29,376 --> 01:27:32,180
You won't be replacing that
son of yours any time soon.

814
01:27:33,553 --> 01:27:36,252
Blood in the urine. Early
indicator of kidney failure.

815
01:27:41,706 --> 01:27:43,336
You should be seeing
double right about now.

816
01:27:46,618 --> 01:27:47,809
That would be a torn meniscus.

817
01:28:31,696 --> 01:28:32,287
James!

818
01:28:32,397 --> 01:28:33,992
Gun!

819
01:28:40,584 --> 01:28:42,076
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

820
01:28:46,599 --> 01:28:48,627
Please help us!
-Shut the fuck up!

821
01:28:50,641 --> 01:28:52,305
C'mon Castle, don't be shy.

822
01:28:56,991 --> 01:28:58,118
Throw down your gun!

823
01:29:04,275 --> 01:29:08,184
Die you bastard.
-No, James

824
01:29:08,184 --> 01:29:12,023
That's no way to punish the Punisher.

825
01:29:30,974 --> 01:29:31,869
Nice shooter!

826
01:29:45,241 --> 01:29:49,954
Catch! Let's play a game.
What do you say?

827
01:29:50,054 --> 01:29:51,991
You got one round left in there.

828
01:29:51,991 --> 01:29:56,725
You shoot one of these two
I'll let the other one go free.

829
01:29:57,638 --> 01:29:59,773
What do you say, Frank?

830
01:30:00,078 --> 01:30:02,709
Who's it to be,
your fat friend right here?

831
01:30:03,018 --> 01:30:04,544
Or that nice little piece
of jailbait over there?

832
01:30:05,792 --> 01:30:06,721
Burn in hell!
-Ok

833
01:30:06,822 --> 01:30:08,022
Then they both die.

834
01:30:09,133 --> 01:30:09,758
Frank!

835
01:30:10,703 --> 01:30:15,112
She's a kid. Shoot me.

836
01:30:32,156 --> 01:30:34,161
Ok, fuck it, kill her first!
-No!

837
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:35,094
Stop!

838
01:30:38,103 --> 01:30:38,661
He's made a decision.

839
01:30:41,913 --> 01:30:44,784
Not looking too good for you, fatso

840
01:30:49,097 --> 01:30:51,091
You have to three, Castle!

841
01:30:51,292 --> 01:30:52,192
One

842
01:30:54,075 --> 01:30:54,911
Two

843
01:30:54,911 --> 01:31:00,186
You won't feel a thing my friend.

844
01:31:20,874 --> 01:31:21,238
God!

845
01:31:43,797 --> 01:31:45,426
Frank!

846
01:31:55,759 --> 01:31:56,658
Get out!

847
01:32:22,124 --> 01:32:23,286
Fuck you!

848
01:32:24,129 --> 01:32:24,789
Let me put you out of my misery!

849
01:32:32,482 --> 01:32:34,281
This is just the beginning!

850
01:32:58,746 --> 01:33:01,275
You ok?

851
01:33:01,453 --> 01:33:02,611
Where is Castle?
-Still inside

852
01:33:03,558 --> 01:33:04,583
And Micro?

853
01:33:11,144 --> 01:33:12,442
Frank!
Are you ok?

854
01:33:21,502 --> 01:33:22,094
You better get out of here.

855
01:33:23,607 --> 01:33:25,136
Come on, Frank, I'll buy you a drink.

856
01:33:26,246 --> 01:33:27,510
Wait! Wait!

857
01:33:29,154 --> 01:33:33,894
My husband Nicky, we talked about you.

858
01:33:35,703 --> 01:33:36,933
Argued about you.

859
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:42,409
He said you were one of the good guys.

860
01:34:28,698 --> 01:34:31,729
You know buddy?
Maybe it's time to quit now, huh?

861
01:34:32,775 --> 01:34:35,646
I mean, you must get tired of this, right?

862
01:34:36,685 --> 01:34:38,557
I think you got all the criminals in town.

863
01:34:38,557 --> 01:34:41,257
If there are any left
at least consider rehabilitation.

864
01:34:44,738 --> 01:34:47,377
I mean contrary to popular
belief, people can change.

865
01:34:47,377 --> 01:34:51,610
I guess what I'm saying is, I'm
just personally not a fan of the death penalty.

866
01:34:54,863 --> 01:34:55,523
Frank?

867
01:34:56,299 --> 01:34:59,006
Where did he go?

868
01:34:59,006 --> 01:35:02,242
Hey, give me your fucking
wallet motherfucker!

869
01:35:03,283 --> 01:35:06,724
You're kidding right?
Do I look like I'm fucking kidding?

870
01:35:07,496 --> 01:35:09,427
Frank!
- Give me your wallet!

871
01:35:11,002 --> 01:35:11,838
Frank?

872
01:35:11,838 --> 01:35:12,804
Do you wanna die?

873
01:35:15,883 --> 01:35:18,849
For the last time, give me your wallet!

874
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:25,750
Oh God. Now I've got
brains splattered all over me.
