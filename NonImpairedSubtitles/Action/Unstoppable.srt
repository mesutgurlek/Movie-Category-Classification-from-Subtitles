317
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,853
Do I look like
I got a train hidden
in my back pocket?

318
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,107
Bunny. get me Connie.
It's Ned.

319
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,446
Get behind us. jackass.

320
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,148
Did you get here too late?
Don't give me that shit.

You two numbnuts
are always screwing up.

322
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,449
You switched the track
that was supposed to get
the train on the right track.

323
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,780
Connie. Yeah. it's Ned.

324
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,157
Did you throw
that switch yet?

325
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,742
Yeah. six minutes ago.
but your train.
it's not here.

326
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,953
I thought it might be
going a little slower
than you guessed,

327
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,629
but these two numbnuts
that you sent.

328
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,956
they just showed up
and they ain't
seen it. either.

329
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,712
Are you saying our
train's already passed?

330
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,384
Yes. ma'am.
That'd be my guess.

331
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,003
It's not a coaster.
That train's under power.

332
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,258
That'd be my guess. too.

333
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,008
Put Dewey on the phone.
Sure.

334
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,512

to you. asshole.

the independent.

338
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,983
was the throttle in
the forward position?

339
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,810
Yeah. I had to
get it moving!

340
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,317
In what position
was the throttle set?

341
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,399
Damn it. Dewey.
what position?

342
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,495
Connie. the throttle
was in notch 8. full power.

343
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,743

get back in your car
and follow the mainline. Okay?

00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,731

from Wilkins.

470

Forty minutes
out of Fuller Yard.

471
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,432
Negative. 1 206.
Clear your train
at the next siding

472
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,233
until further instructed.
Over.

473
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,730
What's up?

474
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:45,026
There's an unmanned train
out of Fuller, on the
northbound track. Over.

475
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,400
On our track?

476
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,531
A coaster?

477
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,737
1 206. we don't have
all the details yet.

478
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,039

the next siding
and hold tight. Over.

479

Affirmative, 1206.

481

482

until we give you
the all-clear. Over.

483
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,626
Affirmative.

484
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,673
It's coming right at us.

485

More word on that
runaway freight train
in rural Pennsylvania.

486
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,901
The train, A WVR777,

487
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,070
otherwise known as 777,

488

Ieft Fuller
Yard in northern PA

489
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,275
sometime before 8: 00 a. m.
this morning

490
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,109
and no one was onboard.

491
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,783
MALE AN NOU NCER:
Live, local,
late-breaking.

492
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,748
The engineer, they say,
made an error in
controlling the train.

493
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,370
Before leaving
the locomotive,

494
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,578
he intended to apply
the independent brakes.

495
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,583
And then by the time
he realized his mistake,

496
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,423
the train was going too fast
for him to climb back on.

497
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,251
We're being told
now by a spokesperson

498
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,919
for the Public
Utilities Commission

499
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,676
that this employee
will be held accountable.

500
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,065

Yeah.

501

on the phone. It's Galvin.

502
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,451
Mr. Galvin. how are you?

503
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,948
God damn it.
How could this happen?

504
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:19,333
It's an unfortunate
combination of human error
and bad luck.

505
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,534
Luck?

506
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,961
I was a yardmaster
for 1 0 years. Ms. Hooper.

507
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,913
Luck has no business
in a rail yard.

508
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,003
What are we worried about
in terms of cargo?.

509
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,126
Well. obviously.
the diesel fuel's a concern.

510
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,965
No, I said cargo.

511
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,720
Okay. well.
cars 7 through 1 0

512
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,971
and 1 6 through 1 9
are carrying a chemical
called molten phenol.

513
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,972
We're still trying to
connect with the shipper

514
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,553
to determine
exactly what that is.

515
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,354
It's used in
the manufacture of glue.

516
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,147
Can you hold on
one moment?

517
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,267
You know about
molten phenol?

518
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,644
Yes.

519
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,316
Mr. Galvin. we have
an FRA inspector here.

520
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,026
May I put you on speaker?

How can I help?

522
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,084
Just tell me what you know
about molten phenol.

523
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:08,006
Well. it's serious stuff.
Very toxic.
highly combustible.

Oh, that's terrific.

525

police back on the line.

526
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,174
Make sure they
got a HazMat team
briefed and ready.

527
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,215
And ask them to
put a spotter chopper
over 777.

528
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,304

sided all rail traffic?

how are we going
to handle this?

532
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,273
I mean. this train
is en route to pass

533
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,191
through some
highly populated areas.

534

the call. Ms. Hooper.

Listen. Mr. Galvin.

544
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:58,432
this train is half a mile
long and is traveling
at speed into population

545

with eight freight cars of
hazardous chemicals

of diesel fuel.

Sir, we're not just talking
about a train here.

548

We're talking about
a missile the size of
the Chrysler Building.

549

So. what is your
point. Ms. Hooper?

550
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,606
My point is
after it crosses
through Findlay.

551
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,983
there's about 1 2 miles
of vacant farmland.

00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,410

limited window here.

suggesting we do.
derail it?

Yes. sir. I am.

that's gonna cost the company
a lot of money...

Do you think?.

560
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,844
Ms. Hooper. we're not
gonna intentionally destroy
one of our own trains.

561
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,770
Not when we can
still stop it.

562
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,431
We can avoid
a lot of collateral...

563
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,266

00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,040
FRANK: Affirmative.

775
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,257
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

776
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,346
Why are you braking?

777
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,180
Trust me. If we head
in this hot. we'll tear
right off the track.

778
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,891
Oh. Jesus.

779
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,232
Get her down to 40
and brace yourself.

780
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,204
You need to get at least
1 0 cars into the siding.

781
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,462
Yes!

782
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,755
(EXHALES)

783
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:49,953
CLARK ON RADIO:
Frank, go to 6.
Frank, go to 6.

784
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,500
Yeah. I'm at 6. Go.

785
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,790
They're evacuating Arklow.

786
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,800
They're going to
derail the train.

787
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,718
What are they using?

788
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,797
Standard DRE.

789
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,639
Yeah.
a portable derailer.

790
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,187
WILL: What are you doing?

791
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,891
I got a look at that train's
last coupler knuckle.
it was open.

792
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,560
We take off right now.
we get back on the main.

793
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,236
we can chase it
down in reverse.

794
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,563
Chase?
Whoa. wait a minute.

795
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,365
The only way to stop
that kind of power.
grab it by the tail.

796
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,737
boom. gun it in
the opposite direction.

797
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,069
We can't just chase it down.
If it goes down.

798
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,573
we're gonna be
a wreck on a wreck.

799
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,158
Doesn't matter.
There's a good chance
the derailer won't work.

800
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,502
It's called a derailer.
for Christ's sake!

801
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,079
That's what they do!
A train that size

802
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,256
going that fast.
it will vaporize anything
that gets in its way.

803
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,833
Bullshit!
They wouldn't use it if...

804
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,340
They're wrong. all right?
They're wrong.

805
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,300
Are you in or are you out?

806
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,427
You want to get
yourself killed.
you do it alone.

807
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,679
You know what?
Ask your wife
what she thinks.

808
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,678
Wait!

809
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,437
If you're right and
that derailer fails.

810
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,393
what are the odds it
makes it to Stanton?

811
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,984
You saw the train.
What do you think?

812
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,550
1 206. this is Connie Hooper.
Are you there?

813
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,310
1 206. Over.

814
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,262
Just wanted to see
how you boys are doing.

815
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,319
We're doing about 60
mile an hour. Connie.

816
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,276
Sorry? Frank.
I don't understand.

817
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,399
We're going
after your train.

818
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,450
1206, I'm not hearing you.

819
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,027
The rear knuckle
was left open.

820
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,613
so if we can catch up.
we can tie it on
to our locomotive.

821
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,244
try and slow down 777.

822
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,495
Frank. you can't.

823
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,701
We already are.

824
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,502
Portable derailer's
not gonna cut it. Connie.

825
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,746
Who said anything
about a derailer?

826
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:01,004
Dispatch.
they said that they're
evacuating Arklow.

827
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,175
Two plus two is four.

828
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,300
It's Ned. He said
he's still following...
No. No. No.

829
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,723
Tell him I'll call him back.
Get me Galvin. now.

830
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,598
Frank. that train's
carrying 30.000 gallons
of toxic chemicals.

831
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,439
They had a window before.
but that train's going
into populated areas.

832
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,936
There's no way
they'd derail it now.

833
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,606
Are you sure about that?

834
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,023
Look. Iet me
make some calls.

835
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,317
Make some calls. Please.

836
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,460
What do you think?
Do you think
they can catch up?

837
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,751
Possibly.
But even if they do.

838
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:44,335
we're talking about
coupling at 1 0 times
the normal speed. in reverse.

839
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,178
I thought you were
in favor of derailment.

840
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:49,552
Yeah. when they were
in the middle of nowhere.
not now.

841
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,133
It's just town
after town out there!

842
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,968
Mr. Galvin says he'd
have to call you back.

843
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,145
This is Connie Hooper
for Mr. Galvin.

844
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,472
WOMAN: Mr. Galvin is
in a meeting.

845
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,816
Then maybe you can tell me.
Is the company planning
on derailing 777?

846
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,394
Last I heard.
Galvin was dead
set against it.

847
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,229
I'm sorry,
I'd really like to
help you, Ms. Hooper.

848
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,905
But I'm not at liberty
to give you that information.

849
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,325
No. of course
you're not at liberty to.

850
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,323
Frank's right.

851
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,041
What's the fastest
you've taken a single
engine like this?

852
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:21,956
Unattached?
Yeah.

853
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,006
Fifty. 55.

854
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,338
Of course.
I was going forward.

855
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,303
CONNIE ON RADIO:
1206, you there?.

856
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,347
This is 1 206. over.

857
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,761
Frank, you're right.

858
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:34,389
About the derailment.

859
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,436
They're planning an attempt
outside of Arklow.

860
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,271
Tell them idiots
it ain't gonna work.

861
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,109
That portable derailer.
it's worthless.

862
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:44,562
She already told us.

863
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:49,359
Frank. this is Oscar Galvin.
VP of Operations.

864
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,195
patched in at his request.
open mike.

865
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:57,040
Yeah.
we're derailing 777. Frank.
It's a done decision.

866
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,618
Like it or not,
it's our best option
at this stage.

867
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,045
There'll be less collateral
damage in Arklow.

868
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,834
It's already being evacuated.

869
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:06,793
and we can't let 777
make it to Stanton.

870
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,003
Look. Mr. Galvin.
with all due respect.

871
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,712
I've been railroading
28 years.

872
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,049
I'm telling you.
we got a real chance
to stop this thing.

873
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,554
No. we already tried.

874
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:19,059
That was from the front.
We're long hood lead back.

875
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,186
It's a different situation.
We got more control now.

876
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,563
What if I cancel the derailer
and you fail. Frank?

877
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,486
That train will be doing
70 miles an hour

878
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,659
into that elevated
S-curve in Stanton.

879
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,532
The damage will
be 1 00 times worse.

880
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:38,787
Right. I'm just telling you.
the portable derailer
is worthless.

881
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,960
You got too much train
traveling entirely too fast.

882
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,748
Maybe 1 206 should just
stay on it as a backup.

883
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:50,002
Look. I am not
jeopardizing more personnel
and more property

884
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,884
just because some engineer
wants to play hero.

885
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:54,761
End of discussion!

886
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,102
That train is our property.
It's our decision!

887
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:02,481
Now you stop your pursuit
or I will fire you!

888
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,192
Fire. (CHUCKLES)
You already did.

889
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,440
Already did what?

890
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,992
You've already fired me.

891
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:20,078
I received my 90-day notice
in the mail 72 days ago.

892
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:23,122
Forced early retirement.
half benefits.

893
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,763
So you're going to
risk your life for us
with three weeks left.

894
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,928
Not for you.

895
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,056
I'm not doing it for you.

896
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,140
Frank.
Let me see that thing.

897
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,272
Mr. Galvin.
this is Will Colson.
your conductor.

898
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,199
I'm letting you know.
we're going to
run this bitch down.

899
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:02,620
Maybe you didn't
hear what I just said.
Colson. I will fire you!

900
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:08,414
Well. that's too bad.
I was just starting
to like this job.

901
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:15,091
God damn it, you listen to me!
You son of a bitch!
You will be fired!

902
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:18,640
You're breaking up.
Sorry. you're...
(MUMBLES GIBBERISH)

903
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,273
This garbage is...
Sir. I think they're gone.

904
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,771
This is your
headache now. Hooper.

905
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:36,199
Now you get them
off the main or consider
yourself shit-canned. too!

906
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,285
I like them.

907
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,954
Bring up Beech Siding
to Arklow.

908
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,413
Take a look behind me,
you can see emergency
evacuation measures

909
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:48,041
are currently in effect
right here in the tiny town
of Arklow.

910
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,669
The lash-up was a no-go.

911
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,219
1 206 to Fuller Yard.
Connie. are you there? Over.

912
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,975
Frank. I'm real sorry
about Galvin.

913
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,897
That's okay.
Listen. Iisten. Is he off?

914
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,020
Yeah. he's gone.

915
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,692
Okay. Iisten up.

916
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,269
I'm going to need you
to do us a favor.

917
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:16,403
I need you to keep us
posted on the speed
and location of 777.

918
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,108
Location and speed.
Over.

919
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,036
Connie?

920
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:26,162
Frank. 777's
9 miles out of Arklow.

921
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,493
You got some
catching up to do.

922
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,918
9 miles out of Arklow.

923
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,515
What did you say
your wife's first name was?

924
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,641
Darcy.

925
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:49,769
So. what was the long story
you didn't want to make long?

926
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,524
I come home from
work two weeks ago

927
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,570
and she's
texting on the phone.

928
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,320
I ask her who with.
she says. ""Nobody.""

929
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,701
I say. ""Let me see
the phone."" She says no.

930
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,245
This goes on
five or six times.

931
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,831
Wait. you're losing me.
She's texting...

932
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,700
There's this guy
we both went to school with.

933
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,956
He's a cop.
he's a PA state trooper.

934
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,710
He's always had
a thing for Darcy.
Going way back.

935
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,336
CONNIE: 1206, where are you?.

936
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:19,215
1 206 here. Connie.
We're just passing
milepost 5-7.

937
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,967
You're about a mile
and a half behind.

938
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,342
How far out of Arklow
is 777?

939
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:28,053
Seven and a half miles.
It picked up speed.
You better step on it.

940
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:30,480
I'm stepping on it.
in it. around it
and through it. Connie.

941
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,148
Thank you. Over.

942
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:36,816
She's texting on the phone.
I keep on asking for it.
she keeps on saying no.

943
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,156
She starts to walk
away and I grab for it.

944
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,984
You hit her?
No. no. no.

945
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:48,077
I mean. I scared her.
but I didn't hit her.

946
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,792
Anyway. I drive
to this guy's house

947
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,416
and tell him we need to talk.
Iet's take a ride.

948
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,338
He jumps in my truck
and starts in with.

949
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,916
""You got it all wrong.
We're just friends.""

950
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,127
Then he stops once he sees

951
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,338
the gun I got
sitting on the dash.
Oh!

952
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:08,515
I look him in the eye
and say. ""She's my wife.
You find a new friend.""

953
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,970
You pulled a gun on a cop?

954
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,430
CONNIE: Frank?.

955
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,688
Frank. 777 just
passed milepost 61.

956
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,193
Thank you. Connie.

957
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,191
You want to hear the kicker?
Yes. I do.

958
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:23,529
It wasn't even him
that was texting her.
It was my sister-in-law.

959
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,784
Anyway.
by the time I got home.
his buddy's waiting for me.

960
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,991
just waiting to serve me
with this restraining order.

961
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,627
Darcy wouldn't
even look at me.

962
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,709
So I'm living
with my brother.

963
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:43,887
There was a hearing today.
The judge ordered
a 30-day extension.

964
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:50,056
It's like one day
everything's going okay.

965
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,478
and the next. it's all
falling apart faster

966
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:53,806
than you can put
it back together.

967
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,186
Yeah.
Never too late. though.

968

FEMALE REPORTER:
The plan to derail
this 39-car runaway train

969
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,788
is just minutes away now.

970
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,912
There's a tremendous
amount of activity
going on.

971
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,120
Will this train be
able to be stopped?.

We're just passing
milepost 6-2.

01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,046
Milepost 6-2, over.

974
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:24,753
Still a mile gap.
maybe more.

975
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,588
We're not
gaining on her. Frank.

976
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,757
Hold on.

977
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,972
It's just like
the shooting range!

978
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:39,559
All right. here we go!
Come on! Let's go!
This is it! It's game time!

01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,367
Remember. we're aiming
for the red circular button!

980
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,539
Now!

981
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,580
Hold your fire!
You're shooting
the fuel cap. God damn it!

982
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,039
Hold your fire!

983
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,716
We were aiming to
disable it by firing
shotgun rounds

984
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:08,137
at a fuel stop safety switch,
and so some shots were fired.

985
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:11,137
FEMALE REPORTER:
That safety switch is
a mighty small target.

986
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,640
And it's right
next to a fuel tank.

987
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:20,396
We're not gonna
catch it before Arklow.

988
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:23,479
Frank.
you're closing the gap.
You should cut your speed.

989
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,901
Allow yourself some
stopping distance.
Just in case.

990
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,699
No can do. Connie.
If we slow down now.
we'll never catch it.

991
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,243
Not before Stanton. Over.

992
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,661
It's your call.

993
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:35,832
However,
we have now also learned
that two railroad employees

994
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:40,333
are now in
pursuit of train 777
in a single locomotive.

995
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,788
It is unclear
what their plan is...

(INTERCOM BUZZES)
WOMAN ON INTERCOM:
Connie Hooper for you.

Did I or did I not tell you
to get 1 206 off the main?

01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,508
I asked them nicely.

You're 1 00%% sure that

Yes. 1 00%%%? No.

Pretty funny.

1003

And if it does?

1004
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:12,865
If it does. then
we're a wreck on a wreck.

I'm here with FRA
official Gene Devereaux.

This train is getting close.
How is this going to work?.

1007
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,123
Basically,
it works like a ramp.

The train comes along,

1009
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:27,501
this piece here
will lift the flange
and pull it outside the rail.

1010
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:31,634
That will cause
the train to flip over
on its right-hand side.

are far more focused

01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:14,273
... at speeds of up
to 70 miles an hour
in reverse.

1073
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,446
777 is now just miles away
from the significantly...

1074
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,444
Come on. Darcy. Iet's go.
Come on. get dressed.

1075
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,446
...more populated
town of Stanton.

1076
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,533
Let's go. boys!

1077
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:46,892
Okay.
you're getting close.

1078
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,562
The gap's at a mile
and 777 is 1 0 miles
to Stanton.

1079
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,891
Now. Iisten.
Frank. I got a guy here
named Werner from the FRA.

1080
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,977
Now. I'm inclined to defer
to your judgment here.
but he...

1081
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:58,234
All right. Put him on.
We could use all
the help we can get.

1082
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,691
Just press this
and hold to talk.

1083
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,579
It's about slowing 777
once you've tied on.

1084
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,531
I know
conventional wisdom says

1085
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,163
to just gun it in
the opposite direction.

1086
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,165
But you'll have
a better shot

1087
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,089
alternating full throttle
with dynamic braking.

1088
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,507
Yeah. but we can't afford
to lose counterthrust.

1089
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,714
What you'll lose
in counterthrust

1090
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,545
you'll compensate for
in tractive force.

1091
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,256
Are you sure about that?

1092
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,060
Well. it's more of a hunch
based on some
quick calculations.

1093
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,263
It's a hunch.

1094
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,475
I'm 70 miles an hour
and he's giving us a hunch.

1095
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,403
Okay. Thank you.
Put Connie back on. please.

1096
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,774
It's me, Frank.

1097
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:42,699
Yeah. Connie.
does this guy know
what he's talking about?

1098
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,864
In a perfect world.

1099
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,746
yes. I'd say yes.

1100
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,619
In a perfect world. okay.

1101
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:54,077
We have more now on
that runaway freight train
in rural Pennsylvania.

They've devised
an ambitious plan
to bring it to a stop.

1103

A single locomotive
moves in from behind,

1104
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:04,217
catches up,
hooks up and then brakes
in an effort to slow it down.

1105

Passing milepost 7 -6.
Connie. Over.

a half mile away.

how are you gonna gauge
our gap distance?

1109

I could signal you by hand.

Would it help?

All right.

Yeah.

at a four.
Four.

with the throttle

braking each car.

Frank. our engine
block's overheated.

1279

I don't think those
hand brakes are gonna

1280

to stop this thing.

three of these buildings

It made it through
the Stanton curve.

1305
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:13,628
777 is through
the Stanton curve,

out of trouble.

Was I worried?.
Nah. Not really.

I wouldn't have
undertaken such a task...

Just got off the line
with corporate.

when you realized
what was happening?

I felt I was in
my comfort zone.

What'd they say
about your job?

1398
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,422
They said it's mine
if I want to keep it.

1399
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:58,839
They'd be stupid
not to give it to you.

1400
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:01,467
Yeah.
That's what I told them.

Said they better think about
giving me a better one. too.

As you can see,
the result was a positive.
Ned...

1404

Do we have
any better of an idea
as to how this happened?
