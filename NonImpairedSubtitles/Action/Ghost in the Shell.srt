1
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:33,017
To all patroling air units.
A 208 is in progress...

2
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:34,852
...in the C-13 district
of Newport City.

3
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:38,486
The airspace over this area
will be closed. Repeat:

4
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:41,554
To all patroling air units.
A 208 is in progress...

5
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:43,622
...in the C-13 district
of Newport City.

6
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,760
The airspace over this area
will be closed. Repeat...

7
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:15,557
There's nothing
to worry about.

8
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:18,567
You can try it again once
you're in our country.

9
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,500
"Try it again?"

10
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,368
Just as there's no such thing
as a bug-free program...

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,433
...there's no program
that can't be debugged.
Am I wrong?

12
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,535
You don't understand.

13
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:32,275
We still don't know if
it really is a bug.

14
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:34,783
Project 2501's
original purpose was--

15
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:37,820
Major, Section 6
is ready to move in.

16
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:42,289
- Major!
- I hear you.

17
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:46,461
There's a lot of
static in your brain.

18
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:48,690
It's that time
of the month.

19
00:01:56,706 --> 00:01:59,573
Won't there be trouble
if Section 9 butts in
on Section 6's operation?

20
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:01,702
That diplomat's a pretty
well-known bastard.

21
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:05,339
Even if they catch him there,
all they can do is deport him.

22
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:10,512
We're the only ones
who can get our hands dirty.

23
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:13,215
They're moving.
Take us over to
the extraction point.

24
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,756
What? The police?

25
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,497
Stop it! Who told you to
open fire?! Drop your guns!

26
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:13,105
I have diplomatic immunity!
Let me see who's in charge!

27
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,515
Transporting a listed programmer
out of the country...

28
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:17,576
...violates our
arms export treaty.

29
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:21,522
I could also have you
charged with kidnapping.

30
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:23,559
Give the man up.

31
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:26,254
I'm afraid not. He's applied
for political asylum with us...

32
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:29,196
...and he's already signed
a statement to that effect!

33
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:32,029
- When?!
- I don't have to tell you!

34
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:34,866
By right of international law,
my country can...

35
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:37,907
...offer him protection
and right of safe passage.

36
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:40,135
The document is on file
at our embassy.

37
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,405
I'll transfer a copy to you
in a few days.

38
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,004
Are you sure about this?
They won't take you back alive.

39
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:47,276
I must ask that you
watch what you say.

40
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,580
Our country is
a peace-loving democracy.

41
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:51,643
Is that a fact?

42
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,449
Out the window! Shoot!

43
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,428
Thermoptic camouflage...

44
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:57,651
This is a rare pleasure,
Mr. Aramaki.

45
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,423
What can the Foreign Ministry
do for Section 9?

46
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,521
What are these secret talks
you've scheduled with...

47
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:04,589
...the Gavel Republic
for tomorrow?

48
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,692
The usual. Foreign aid.

49
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:09,670
The new government
reopened the request
after the revolution.

50
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:12,299
They claim to be
more democratic...

51
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,173
...but they'll probably be
as bad as the last bunch.

52
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:17,769
Giving them money
they don't earn
will help nobody.

53
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:20,407
They consider it reparation
for past exploitation
and won't thank--

54
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,781
And what will
the government do?

55
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:25,514
The problem is that
we have the leader of...

56
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:28,113
...the old junta here
looking for political asylum.

57
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:30,056
Col. Maless, right?

58
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:33,220
So, do we throw him out
and grant them the aid?

59
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:36,595
Or do we publicly
recognize him as a refugee
and cut the aid?

60
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,430
Not an easy decision
to make.

61
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:42,630
Personally, if I could find
a politically acceptable
reason...

62
00:09:42,705 --> 00:09:46,072
...l'd have the man deported
in a heartbeat.

63
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:58,609
Oh yes, thanks for your help
with that programmer defection.

64
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:01,452
Nakamura over in Section 6
said he was grateful.

65
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:04,516
After all,
we in the diplomatic corps
have to keep our hands clean.

66
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,525
Accessed.

67
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:15,400
We've lost response.
How's her brainwave output look?

68
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:18,929
Normal.
Switching over the virtual
experience mode pattern.

69
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:22,368
The Foreign Minister's
interpreter.

70
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:26,939
23 minutes ago,
her cyber-brain was hacked
via telephone connection.

71
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:31,447
Just as Foreign lntelligence
division predicted...

72
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:33,512
...the Puppet Master
has begun to break into...

73
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,557
...every terminal
on the network.

74
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,059
Pattern analysis shows
a high probability that...

75
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:41,221
...he's attempting to disrupt
secret talks with Gavel.

76
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:44,391
We've placed everyone attending
the talks under surveillance.

77
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,901
Probably trying
to hack her ghost...

78
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:50,336
...so she'll kill
people at the meeting.

79
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:55,207
How long till he hacks
through her protection
and reaches her ghost?

80
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,942
He's using an old-style HA-3.
I'd say about two hours.

81
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,916
After that,
we'll have to cut the line
to eliminate all risk.

82
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:05,317
Batou and lshikawa
are in a car,
tracing the signal.

83
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:07,413
Rendezvous with them.

84
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:28,899
The Puppet Master...
That phantom hacker, right?

85
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:31,242
They think
he's an American.

86
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:34,112
Age, sex, personal history...
Everything about him is unknown.

87
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:37,243
Since last winter he's been
mainly active in the EC.

88
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,016
Internationally wanted
on dozens of charges of...

89
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,819
...stock manipulation,
spying, political engineering...

90
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:46,453
...terrorism, and violation
of cyber-brain privacy.

91
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,726
He's ghost-hacked
so many people
to carry out his crimes...

92
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,359
...he's earned the code name
"The Puppet Master."

93
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:55,131
This is the first instance
of him operating
in this country.

94
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:59,504
So, if he's so hot,
why's he using an old HA-3?

95
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:05,138
Well, a newer type
would be less detectable
and be harder to trace.

96
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:10,379
But it could also implicate
the former junta leader,
Col. Maless.

97
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:15,447
So he's using an older type
to keep us from suspecting him.

98
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:19,961
Or somebody else
wants us to think that.

99
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:23,430
Maless may just be another pawn
in this whole thing.

100
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:27,435
Now you're overthinking this.
There's no evidence of that.

101
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:29,130
Evidence?

102
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,932
I just have a whisper...
A whisper from my ghost.

103
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,036
By the way, are you
still using that revolver?

104
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:40,014
Afraid both guns
in a two-man team'll jam up?

105
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:41,913
I like the Matever.

106
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:44,077
Since I depend on your backup,
I think stopping power is...

107
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:46,417
...more important than
personal preference.

108
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:48,514
Especially since it's
my ass on the line.

109
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:51,253
Use the Zastaber instead.

110
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,763
Major, I've been
meaning to ask you.

111
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,425
Why'd you ask for a guy
like me to be transferred
in from the police?

112
00:12:58,501 --> 00:12:59,900
Because you're
a guy like you.

113
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:01,527
Huh?

114
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:06,541
An honest cop with a clean
record. And you've got
a regular family.

115
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:10,807
With the exception of
your cyber-net implants,
your brain's real.

116
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,348
No matter how powerful
we may be fighting-wise...

117
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,214
...a system where
all the parts react
the same way...

118
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:19,550
...is a system
with a fatal flaw.

119
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:21,146
Like individual,
like organization.

120
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:23,623
Overspecialization
leads to death.

121
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:24,785
That's all.

122
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:39,263
- Come on!
- All right!

123
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,580
We're already 40 seconds
behind schedule!

124
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:49,982
- Gimme five more seconds.
- Of all the lousy luck...

125
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,017
Hey, sorry.

126
00:13:58,094 --> 00:14:01,086
My last partner,
the one they busted
for working without...

127
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:03,631
...a permit,
was a better worker than you!

128
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:08,429
You're actually trying
to ghost-hack your own wife...

129
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:10,563
...just to see
what's on her mind?

130
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,133
She doesn't have any time for me
and now she wants a divorce.

131
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:18,271
On top of that, my daughter,
my only child...

132
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,679
...thinks I'm cheating
on her mother!

133
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,117
So how'd you get your hands
on cracking software?

134
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:29,089
From some programmer.
A really nice guy
I met in a bar.

135
00:14:29,158 --> 00:14:32,093
I told him my wife's lawyer
was keeping me
from seeing her...

136
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:33,958
...and he said he'd help.

137
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,726
Told me to access
from different places
to keep from getting caught.

138
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,664
Smart guy, huh?

139
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,164
Asshole! Ya tryin' to
get yourself killed?!

140
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:49,006
Looks like we aren't
the only busy people out here.

141
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:54,740
Nobody here.

142
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:57,149
What's the point?
Even if we trace the calls...

143
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:59,847
...the guy's already gone
by the time we get there.

144
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:02,720
- Vicious cycle, huh?
- Quit complaining!

145
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:05,260
Kusanagi and Togusa
are headed for the next
expected hack point.

146
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,522
You two look
for something there.

147
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:09,029
Look for what?

148
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:11,259
Anything.

149
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,597
Fuckin' old coot.
He tells US to snoop around?!

150
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:15,762
Wait a sec!

151
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:17,999
Damn, missed him.

152
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:20,838
Hey, Pops. Did you see
a garbage truck go by here?

153
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,901
Who wants to know?

154
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:25,003
Did you see it or not?

155
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:28,812
Yeah, but they were gone
by the time I got my trash.

156
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:31,512
One was using the phone,
so I thought I had time--

157
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:37,417
Uh, can you take this
to them?

158
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:41,623
A garbage truck? Of course...
They move every seven minutes.

159
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:45,861
Control! Get me
the trash collection
routes for that sector!

160
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:59,814
There are eight garbage trucks
operating in the target area.

161
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:02,476
Target is a type C
collection truck, #79.

162
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:07,854
Let me drive.

163
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:18,790
Ishikawa, check out
the drivers' homes.

164
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:21,462
Batou, you get to their
next stop before they do!

165
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:25,803
He may be in contact
with someone else.
Observe, but don't move in!

166
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,900
Route data accessed.

167
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:32,437
Hacking points traced
and matched. Target
now stopped at next point.

168
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:36,616
Confirm access via HA-3.

169
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,255
Sorry, sorry.

170
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:47,352
How about I do the trash
and you make the call
on the next stop?

171
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:49,798
Okay?

172
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:52,595
Leave me out of your
little crime spree.

173
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:54,863
Can't believe this
load of bullshit...

174
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:58,270
- Do you have kids?
- Do I look like I do?

175
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,365
Then you couldn't
understand.

176
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,808
My daughter's my life.

177
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:05,938
Take a look. Isn't she
just a little angel?

178
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:09,075
I hate looking at other
peoples' family albums.

179
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:14,579
Yeah, truck 79.
Oh, boss. What's up?

180
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,359
The cops were checking our
routes? You wanna know why?

181
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:21,521
How should I know?!

182
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:28,466
They spotted the hack!
I gotta warn my friend!

183
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:31,131
We're gonna have to
skip our next stop!

184
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:35,576
Target has deviated from route.
Increasing speed to next point.

185
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:39,102
Is he on to us?
Didn't think he could see me.

186
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:41,945
My accessing
the sanitation dept. network
may have tipped him off.

187
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:44,008
Shoulda used a back door.

188
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:46,554
Too late.
Go for the collar.

189
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:53,657
You can drive now.

190
00:18:56,992 --> 00:19:00,120
Jesus... He blew a perfectly
good armored van to shit.

191
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:03,562
He hosed us with
high-velocity AP rounds!
That car door's no cover!

192
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:06,328
In a submachinegun?
The guy must be nuts.

193
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:22,908
He's using
thermoptic camo, too?!

194
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:26,546
Keep after him!
I'll flank him from above!

195
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:30,183
Togusa, if you're still alive,
arrest those two garbage men.

196
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:31,487
Roger.

197
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:35,754
This job just never
lets up, does it?

198
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:37,023
Police! Everybody down!

199
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:40,237
All finished?

200
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:34,832
You all set?

201
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:37,963
That's what you get
when you overload
the ammo rating.

202
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,500
Frame's bent all to hell.
The barrel's shot, too.

203
00:23:42,578 --> 00:23:46,344
Doesn't matter if you arrest me.
I'm not gonna talk!

204
00:23:46,415 --> 00:23:48,406
Talk?!

205
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:54,918
And what would I ask a guy
who doesn't even know
his own name?!

206
00:23:57,025 --> 00:23:59,255
Your mother's face.

207
00:23:59,328 --> 00:24:02,092
The place you grew up in.

208
00:24:02,164 --> 00:24:04,029
Memories of your childhood.

209
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,533
Can you remember
any of those things?

210
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:18,306
There's nothing sadder
than a puppet without a ghost.

211
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,871
Especially the kind
with red blood
running through them.

212
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:39,361
We'll rush the place
once the guys in
the helicopter are inside.

213
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:42,369
Squad B goes around back,
the rest of you take the front.

214
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:47,204
Saito, have your men
pull the plugs
on all their cars.

215
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:49,709
Begin recording.

216
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:55,348
Message from HQ, sir.

217
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:58,409
We've ID'ed the guy
the Major collared.

218
00:24:58,487 --> 00:24:59,852
Go on.

219
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:02,856
Tsuan Gen Fang. Age: 28

220
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:08,089
Illegal alien.
Weapons violations.
Three priors.

221
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:12,793
Was hiding out with
a militant refugee group
up till a month ago.

222
00:25:12,868 --> 00:25:16,304
One week ago,
because of his record...

223
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:19,067
...he was contacted
by a military liason
in the Gavel embassy to...

224
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:22,269
...attack the secret talks
we would be having with them.

225
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:24,437
And the real story?

226
00:25:24,513 --> 00:25:29,610
Nickname: Corgi. Occupation:
a rather violent scrap dealer.

227
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:31,585
Guess you could
call him a thug.

228
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:36,283
We've checked the records
the local cops have on him...

229
00:25:36,358 --> 00:25:40,089
...but we can't find
any connection with Gavel.

230
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:43,359
Another puppet from our friend
the Puppet Master.

231
00:25:43,432 --> 00:25:45,366
And what about lshikawa?

232
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:50,963
He's back. He's with Togusa,
talking to that poor trash man.

233
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:56,042
So, what about
the Puppet Master
on your end?

234
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:59,308
How's he look to you?

235
00:26:03,385 --> 00:26:05,751
Like a puppet himself...

236
00:26:05,821 --> 00:26:08,790
- Squad B, in position.
- Squads A and C, ready!

237
00:26:08,857 --> 00:26:11,121
Ready to move in, sir.

238
00:26:12,094 --> 00:26:14,085
Move in.

239
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:19,395
What do you mean,
a "virtual experience?"

240
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:22,869
I mean your wife, your daughter.
the divorce, the affair...

241
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:26,704
They're all fake memories.
Like a dream.

242
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:30,871
Someone was using you
to ghost-hack
a government official.

243
00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:33,346
No... That's impossible!

244
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:35,781
I've been
to your apartment.

245
00:26:35,851 --> 00:26:38,786
No one's there.
It's a one-room apartment.

246
00:26:38,854 --> 00:26:41,982
Yeah, I moved there
when we split up--

247
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:45,857
You've been living there
for ten years!

248
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:48,623
You have no wife,
no child.

249
00:26:48,697 --> 00:26:51,131
Your family exists
only in your mind.

250
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:56,997
Look. This is the picture
you showed to your partner.

251
00:26:57,706 --> 00:27:00,174
Who is it of?

252
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:04,201
But, she was there.
My daughter...

253
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,009
Smiling like an angel...

254
00:27:07,082 --> 00:27:09,448
What's your
daughter's name?

255
00:27:09,518 --> 00:27:12,214
Where did you meet
your wife, and when?

256
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:15,381
How many years ago
did you get married?

257
00:27:15,457 --> 00:27:19,188
Who do you see
in the picture?

258
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:24,625
How do I get rid of
these fake memories?

259
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:27,497
I'm sorry. With our
current technology...

260
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:29,662
There've been two successful
deprogrammings...

261
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:32,002
...but I can't
recommend it to you.

262
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:33,836
I'm really sorry.

263
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:36,275
Virtual experiences,
dreams...

264
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:41,338
All data that exists
is both reality and fantasy.

265
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:46,411
Whichever it is,
the data a person collects
in a lifetime...

266
00:27:46,488 --> 00:27:49,150
...is a tiny bit
compared to the whole.

267
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:21,041
A cyborg who goes diving
in her spare time.

268
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:25,348
That can't be a good sign.
When did you start doing this?

269
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:34,986
Doesn't the ocean scare you?
lf the floaters
stopped working.

270
00:29:35,063 --> 00:29:38,794
Then I'd probably die.
Or would you dive in after me?

271
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,368
No one forced you
to come out here with me.

272
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:44,166
I just--

273
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:20,505
So, what's it feel like
when you go diving?

274
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:23,874
Didn't you go through
underwater training?

275
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:26,140
I'm not talking about
doing it in a damned pool.

276
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:30,518
I feel fear. Anxiety.
Loneliness. Darkness.

277
00:30:30,585 --> 00:30:33,179
And perhaps, even...hope.

278
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:35,916
Hope? ln the darkness
of the sea?

279
00:30:37,158 --> 00:30:39,251
As I float up
towards the surface...

280
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:43,661
...l almost feel
as though I could change
into something else.

281
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:52,606
As though you want
to quit Section 9?

282
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:59,208
Batou, how much
of your original body
do you have left?

283
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,214
Are you drunk?

284
00:31:01,282 --> 00:31:03,216
Convenient, isn't it?

285
00:31:03,284 --> 00:31:06,219
With the merest thought,
the chemical plants
inside our bodies...

286
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:10,519
...could metabolize
all the alcohol in our blood
in about ten seconds...

287
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,823
Allowing us to sit here
drinking while on stand-by.

288
00:31:13,895 --> 00:31:17,558
If a technological feat
is possible, man will do it.

289
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:20,567
Almost as though it's wired
into the core of our being.

290
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:23,069
Metabolic control.
Enhanced sensory perception.

291
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:25,902
Improved reflexes
and muscle capacity.

292
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:28,841
Vastly increased data
processing speed and capacity.

293
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:33,540
All improvements
thanks to our cyber-brains
and cyborg bodies.

294
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:37,210
So what if we can't live
without high-level maintenance?

295
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:39,185
We have nothing
to complain about.

296
00:31:39,254 --> 00:31:43,520
It doesn't mean we've sold
our souls to Section 9.

297
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:46,583
We do have the right
to resign if we choose.

298
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:49,596
Provided we give the government
back our cyborg shells...

299
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:52,189
...and the memories
they hold.

300
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:56,226
Just as there are
many parts needed
to make a human a human...

301
00:31:56,304 --> 00:31:59,273
...there's a remarkable number
of things needed to make...

302
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,205
...an individual
what they are.

303
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:02,903
A face to distinguish
yourself from others.

304
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:04,535
A voice you aren't
aware of yourself.

305
00:32:04,612 --> 00:32:06,443
The hand you see
when you awaken.

306
00:32:06,514 --> 00:32:09,540
The memories of childhood,
the feelings for the future.

307
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:12,552
That's not all.
There's the expanse
of the data net...

308
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,088
...my cyber-brain
can access.

309
00:32:15,156 --> 00:32:17,090
All of that goes into
making me what I am.

310
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:20,855
Giving rise to a consciousness
that I call "me."

311
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,888
And simultaneously confining
"me" within set limits.

312
00:32:30,271 --> 00:32:33,900
Is that why you dive
into the sea with a body
that only sinks?!

313
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:37,570
What is it you see
in the water's darkness?

314
00:32:37,645 --> 00:32:42,639
"For now we see through
a glass, darkly."

315
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:53,253
That was you, wasn't it?

316
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:02,338
Sensors: restarted.

317
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,503
Auxiliary computer link:
check.

318
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:06,479
Visual sensors: online.

319
00:37:06,547 --> 00:37:09,516
- Cyborg body signal?
- Output: nominal.

320
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,252
Can't you call in
if you're going to be late?

321
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:24,865
We're all set.
Should we hook her up?

322
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:51,191
Okay, looking good!
Kill it!

323
00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:54,228
Be in my office
in three minutes.

324
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:03,632
Since you were late,
I'll explain what's going on.

325
00:38:03,704 --> 00:38:07,640
Two hours ago,
a Megatech Body assembly line
in Newport City...

326
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:10,268
...just started up
and produced a cyborg shell.

327
00:38:10,344 --> 00:38:13,245
By the time the guys in charge
realized what was happening...

328
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:16,078
...the body had escaped.

329
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,142
Then, just as they had
thrown up a cordon
to catch the thing...

330
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,347
...we got a call
from a conscientious
truck driver that...

331
00:38:21,422 --> 00:38:25,449
...he'd just run down
a naked lady wandering
around on the highway.

332
00:38:25,526 --> 00:38:27,960
Which brings us to here.

333
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:31,021
I've heard Megatech Body's
tied pretty closely
to the government...

334
00:38:31,098 --> 00:38:34,033
...and that all the shells
made there are secret.

335
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:36,069
If a hacker did this,
he had to swim through...

336
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:38,401
...some of the heaviest
protection around.

337
00:38:38,473 --> 00:38:40,532
And that isn't
the only problem.

338
00:38:43,644 --> 00:38:49,048
Of course, it doesn't have
an organic brain in its head...

339
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:52,051
...but we've detected
what looks like a ghost...

340
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,053
...in the auxiliary
computer brain.

341
00:38:55,423 --> 00:38:57,891
It isn't unlike
the virtual ghost-line
you get...

342
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:00,393
...when a real ghost
is dubbed off.

343
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:03,328
But it shows none
of the data degradation
dubbing would produce.

344
00:39:03,397 --> 00:39:08,300
Well, until we map
the barrier perimeter
and dive in there...

345
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:10,963
...we won't know
anything for sure.

346
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:13,973
Anyhow, better get back
to checking her over.

347
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,008
Good work.

348
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:18,011
Time to rip her apart.

349
00:39:23,017 --> 00:39:27,920
Come on, you guys don't think
there's a ghost in that thing.

350
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:29,980
It's possible.

351
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:33,686
I've heard celluloid dolls
can have a soul.

352
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:38,357
And this thing's stuffed
full of neurotech devices.

353
00:39:38,432 --> 00:39:40,764
I wouldn't be surprised
if it had a soul.

354
00:39:42,003 --> 00:39:45,063
Since you're new here,
you probably don't know.

355
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:49,075
The Major's shell was
also made by Megatech Body.

356
00:39:49,143 --> 00:39:53,045
Not just hers.
Me and lshikawa for one...

357
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:56,379
...along with Saito and others
all need maintenance and such.

358
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,351
Outside of you and the Chief,
everyone in Section 9...

359
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,389
...needs to make use
of their kind services.

360
00:40:02,456 --> 00:40:07,086
Maybe you can see now why we all
look a little worried, Togusa.

361
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:10,062
Assuming the enemy
is an outsider,
we can't know for sure...

362
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:12,065
...whether he's in that
cyborg body or not.

363
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:14,124
But he cracked through
the protection...

364
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:16,362
...around some of our
most secret files...

365
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:18,997
...and managed to send a program
with a ghost-line on it through.

366
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:23,100
And in a way
that was easy to spot.
What's he after?!

367
00:40:23,177 --> 00:40:25,077
Let's leave that for now.

368
00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:29,606
Togusa, get over to Megatech
and help lshikawa
check the place out...

369
00:40:29,684 --> 00:40:31,618
Batou, I've closed
down the nets...

370
00:40:31,686 --> 00:40:34,746
...with files as sensitive
as Megatech's.

371
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:38,121
I want you to double-check
the protection we have on them.

372
00:40:38,192 --> 00:40:42,151
I'll get a protection maze put
together. I'll dive tomorrow.

373
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:46,393
You sure?
We could force it into
another shell and let it swim.

374
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:51,598
I have to see for myself
what's inside that thing.

375
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:54,664
Don't let anyone else
dive in there before me!

376
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,602
What's with her?

377
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,478
I wrote in my team evaluations
that she's been acting weird...

378
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,280
...ever since this Puppet Master
case fell into our laps.

379
00:41:05,353 --> 00:41:07,617
Do you even read them?!

380
00:41:07,688 --> 00:41:10,657
Chief, do you ever wonder
just how trustworthy
the cyberdocs...

381
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:12,989
...who service
your brain are?

382
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,520
Cyber-brain technicians undergo
regular psychological testing.

383
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:20,795
And security-cleared ones
have their private lives
checked, too.

384
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:24,531
But the people who administer
those checks are only human.

385
00:41:24,605 --> 00:41:27,472
Once you doubt,
you can't stop...

386
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:31,875
Chief, a Mr. Nakamura
from the MFA treaties
bureau to see you.

387
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:34,005
Okay, send him up.

388
00:41:44,892 --> 00:41:46,883
Wasn't that fat guy...?

389
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:51,796
Nakamura, chief of Section 6.
Foreign Affairs treaties bureau.

390
00:41:51,866 --> 00:41:54,232
I don't know who the
white guy with him was.

391
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:58,905
I'm outta here.

392
00:41:58,973 --> 00:42:01,498
Tell lshikawa
to keep cool, okay?

393
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,545
So, what's your problem?

394
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:14,110
Doesn't that cyborg
body look like me?

395
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:16,850
- No, it doesn't.
- Not the face or the figure.

396
00:42:16,924 --> 00:42:18,482
What then?

397
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:23,019
Maybe all
full-replacement cyborgs
like me start wondering this.

398
00:42:24,432 --> 00:42:27,367
That perhaps the real me
died a long time ago...

399
00:42:27,435 --> 00:42:31,804
...and I'm a replicant
made with a cyborg body
and computer brain.

400
00:42:31,872 --> 00:42:35,899
Or maybe there never was
a real "me" to begin with.

401
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:39,468
You've got real brain matter
in that titanium skull of yours.

402
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:42,209
And you get treated like
a real person, don't you?

403
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:45,377
There's no person
who's ever seen their own brain.

404
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:49,890
I believe I exist based only
on what my environment tells me.

405
00:42:49,957 --> 00:42:52,551
Don't you believe
in your own ghost?

406
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:55,595
And what if a computer brain
could generate a ghost...

407
00:42:55,663 --> 00:42:57,563
...and harbor a soul?

408
00:42:57,631 --> 00:43:01,499
On what basis then
do I believe in myself?

409
00:43:08,242 --> 00:43:09,834
Bullshit!

410
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,308
I'll see for myself
what's in that body.
With my own ghost!

411
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:23,490
We're both busy men,
so let's keep this short.

412
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:25,422
I would prefer that.

413
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:27,757
I'm here to take the contents
of that cyborg body.

414
00:43:27,828 --> 00:43:31,093
In return, we absolve Section 9
of all responsibilities
in the case.

415
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:33,726
The Foreign Minister's
signature.

416
00:43:45,646 --> 00:43:49,480
Security, whose official
vehicles are parked
in the basement garage?

417
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:55,113
They belong to Chief Nakamura
of the treaties bureau
and a Dr. Willis

418
00:43:55,189 --> 00:43:58,283
Give me the video record
of their entering the building.

419
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,400
Replay, infra-red view.

420
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:25,075
One... Two... Three...

421
00:44:27,488 --> 00:44:32,721
Send me the pressure sensor
records for basement garage
spaces B-7 and 8.

422
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:56,139
- Major, this is Togusa.
Code 0-9.
- What?

423
00:44:56,217 --> 00:44:59,744
Does Nakamura have some sort
of special cyborg body?

424
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,720
There are no cyborgs
in Section 6.

425
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:04,087
Besides the diplomatic problems,
maintaining them is too much...

426
00:45:04,158 --> 00:45:06,388
...trouble when they
have to go overseas.

427
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,429
So, even if that tall guy
was a cyborg himself...

428
00:45:09,496 --> 00:45:12,727
...together they wouldn't weigh
more than half a ton, right?

429
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,394
Pressure sensor data...
The garage?

430
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:17,027
There are two
VIP-mobiles here.

431
00:45:17,104 --> 00:45:20,073
But neither of them
looks like the type
who'd drive himself.

432
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,404
The security video
only shows the two of them...

433
00:45:22,476 --> 00:45:25,377
...but you know how sensitive
the entrance door sensors are.

434
00:45:25,446 --> 00:45:28,040
They took three full seconds
to close after them.

435
00:45:28,115 --> 00:45:33,018
It's illegal to use
thermoptic camo in
a government building, right?

436
00:45:33,087 --> 00:45:35,783
It's a serious violation
of the National Security Act.

437
00:45:35,856 --> 00:45:40,725
Section 6 is up to something.
You all ready?

438
00:45:40,794 --> 00:45:42,421
If my Matever'll do.

439
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,433
I don't need to remind you
that it's treason for you to...

440
00:46:23,504 --> 00:46:26,871
...be hiding something from me,
no matter how sensitive.

441
00:46:26,941 --> 00:46:28,465
For both of us.

442
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:32,740
Whatever the MFA may prefer,
this case is in
Section 9's jurisdiction.

443
00:46:32,813 --> 00:46:37,750
But we wouldn't mind cooperating
if there was good reason to.

444
00:46:39,053 --> 00:46:40,418
Dr. Willis?

445
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:43,945
Confirmed.
It's definitely him.

446
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:45,491
"Him?"

447
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:50,087
He's referring to the original
ghost block within the shell.

448
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:53,099
Its sex remains undetermined,
and the use of the term "he"...

449
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:56,102
...is merely a nickname
the good doctor has given it.

450
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,967
Perhaps it's time
I introduced you.

451
00:46:58,038 --> 00:47:02,941
This is the most unique hacker
in the history
of cyber-brain crime.

452
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:04,978
The Puppet Master.

453
00:47:06,547 --> 00:47:09,675
I believe you in Section 9
ran into him in that case...

454
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,811
...involving the ghost-hack
on the Foreign Minister's
translatior.

455
00:47:13,887 --> 00:47:16,981
We in Section 6
have been pursuing
the Puppet Master...

456
00:47:17,057 --> 00:47:19,992
...with the utmost urgency
since he first appeared.

457
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,052
We formed a project team
around Dr. Willis...

458
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,497
...to analyze all data
on the Puppet Master's...

459
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:30,025
...criminal tendencies
and behavior patterns.

460
00:47:30,104 --> 00:47:34,006
We then constructed
special anti-Puppet Master
attack protection...

461
00:47:34,074 --> 00:47:37,840
...to lure him into
a secret cyborg body.

462
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:41,039
You made him dive into a body
equipped with a cyber-brain...

463
00:47:41,115 --> 00:47:43,276
...and then had
his real body killed?

464
00:47:43,951 --> 00:47:45,543
Yes, exactly.

465
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:48,383
He may have shown up
in your back yard...

466
00:47:48,455 --> 00:47:51,549
...but he was born in America.
And since we were cooperating...

467
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:54,059
...with the Americans
to catch him we want
to take him back ourselves.

468
00:47:54,128 --> 00:47:55,720
Surely you've
no objections.

469
00:47:55,796 --> 00:48:00,062
Leaving his unidentified corpse
to be found somewhere.

470
00:48:02,736 --> 00:48:04,533
There will be no corpse.

471
00:48:04,605 --> 00:48:08,837
Because, until now,
there never was a body.

472
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:12,276
The sensors are active!
Why didn't you say so?!

473
00:48:12,346 --> 00:48:16,646
We've cut all external controls.
It's running on internal power.

474
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:19,311
I may have entered
this cyborg body because...

475
00:48:19,386 --> 00:48:22,355
...l was unable
to crack Section 6's
attack protection...

476
00:48:22,423 --> 00:48:26,621
...but it was of
my own free will
that I came here.

477
00:48:26,693 --> 00:48:30,629
As an autonomous life-form,
I request political asylum.

478
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:32,028
A life-form?

479
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:35,398
Ridiculous! You're merely
a self-preserving program!

480
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:38,905
By that argument, I submit
the DNA you carry is...

481
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:43,534
...nothing more than
a self-preserving program
itself.

482
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:49,310
Life is like a node
which is born within
the flow of information.

483
00:48:49,383 --> 00:48:53,581
As a species of life
that carries DNA
as its memory system...

484
00:48:53,654 --> 00:48:56,987
...man gains his individuality
from the memories he carries.

485
00:48:57,057 --> 00:49:00,720
While memories may as well
be the same as fantasy...

486
00:49:00,794 --> 00:49:03,729
...it is by these memories
that mankind exists.

487
00:49:03,797 --> 00:49:07,995
When computers made it possible
to externalize memory...

488
00:49:08,068 --> 00:49:12,937
...you should have considered
all the implications that held.

489
00:49:13,006 --> 00:49:15,372
Nonsense!
No matter what you say...

490
00:49:15,442 --> 00:49:17,933
...you've no proof
that you're a life-form!

491
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:21,344
It is impossible
to prove such a thing.

492
00:49:21,415 --> 00:49:26,944
Especially since modern science
cannot define what life is.

493
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,352
Who the devil are you?

494
00:49:29,423 --> 00:49:33,723
Even if you have a ghost,
criminals don't get set free!

495
00:49:33,794 --> 00:49:35,989
You're mistaken if you think
you'll get asylum!

496
00:49:36,063 --> 00:49:39,362
Time is on my side.

497
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:41,867
While there is now
the possibility
I can be killed...

498
00:49:41,935 --> 00:49:44,369
...this country does
not have a death penalty.

499
00:49:44,438 --> 00:49:47,373
Half immortal...
An artificial intelligence?

500
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:49,705
I am not an A.I.

501
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:54,042
My code name
is Project 2501.

502
00:49:55,949 --> 00:50:00,386
I am a life-form that was born
in the sea of information.

503
00:50:10,797 --> 00:50:12,594
Security! lntruders!

504
00:50:16,403 --> 00:50:18,200
Chief, the Puppet Master!

505
00:50:18,272 --> 00:50:22,732
- Where's your security?!
- Lock defense walls! Security!

506
00:50:22,809 --> 00:50:24,140
Security, come in!

507
00:50:48,602 --> 00:50:49,967
All right, I'm moving!

508
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:55,438
Asshole!

509
00:51:00,614 --> 00:51:01,979
Did you do it?

510
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:05,644
Helluva car. My 9mm
didn't even scratch it.

511
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:08,381
Finally found a use
for that Matever of yours.

512
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:13,722
Okay...
Not bad for a rookie.

513
00:51:13,794 --> 00:51:16,388
I got one right
in the license plate.
Pretty good, huh?

514
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:18,260
Next time, get two in.

515
00:51:18,332 --> 00:51:21,392
Okay, now it starts.
Catch up with them
before they switch cars.

516
00:51:25,472 --> 00:51:27,099
The Ministry
of Foreign Affairs...

517
00:51:27,174 --> 00:51:29,665
...will be filing
a formal complaint
about what happened!

518
00:51:29,743 --> 00:51:32,405
Contact me as soon
as you've recaptured him!

519
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,071
Alive, preferably.

520
00:51:34,147 --> 00:51:37,446
Megatech can always
build another body.

521
00:51:41,521 --> 00:51:44,957
Batou and Togusa
are tailing the guys
who took the Puppet Master.

522
00:51:46,627 --> 00:51:48,959
They're on highway 25.

523
00:51:49,029 --> 00:51:51,964
What do you mean?! lf you were
monitoring this, then why--

524
00:51:52,032 --> 00:51:55,627
If we'd got them here,
we'd never prove
Section 6's involvement.

525
00:51:55,702 --> 00:51:57,033
Section 6?!

526
00:51:57,104 --> 00:52:00,938
Definitely.
They used type-2902
thermoptic camo, like mine.

527
00:52:01,008 --> 00:52:04,375
That's only used by us,
the rangers in Section 4,
and Section 6.

528
00:52:04,444 --> 00:52:08,540
Let's go over this.
Section 6 gets
the Puppet Master into a body.

529
00:52:08,615 --> 00:52:13,882
But he chooses
Megatech Body, which is
deeply tied to Section 9.

530
00:52:13,954 --> 00:52:16,252
Then, he claims
to be a life-form...

531
00:52:16,323 --> 00:52:19,383
...and gets nabbed by Section 6
when he asks for asylum.

532
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:21,120
But why do that?

533
00:52:21,194 --> 00:52:23,355
They could've had him
as soon as I took a statement.

534
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:26,627
But what if they were afraid
of what he might have told you?

535
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,759
He did mention something odd,
now that I think about it.

536
00:52:28,835 --> 00:52:31,633
"Code name: Project 2501."

537
00:52:31,705 --> 00:52:33,434
I'll leave that
for you to check.

538
00:52:33,507 --> 00:52:37,705
Now, as to the matter
of attacking Section 9
and stealing evidence...

539
00:52:37,778 --> 00:52:39,939
- You're authorized.
- Okay, punch it!

540
00:52:46,186 --> 00:52:48,450
Kusanagi! One more thing!

541
00:52:48,522 --> 00:52:51,821
You can punish me
for acting without orders
when I get back.

542
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:55,487
If you can't recover him,
I want the Puppet Master
destroyed.

543
00:52:55,562 --> 00:52:57,120
Without fail.

544
00:52:58,799 --> 00:53:00,426
Well?!

545
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,728
Roger.

546
00:53:03,503 --> 00:53:06,472
Contact the airport
and stop any flights
due to take on...

547
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,441
...any Foreign Ministry officials
or American diplomats.

548
00:53:09,509 --> 00:53:11,067
Close the highways
and set up roadblocks.

549
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:13,044
Recall our off-duty personnel
for this.

550
00:53:13,113 --> 00:53:14,944
And get lshikawa back here!

551
00:53:15,015 --> 00:53:19,384
Use the entrance data
to find out who the Caucasian
with Nakamura was.

552
00:53:19,453 --> 00:53:23,412
And search for any sort
of MFA project, operation,
or anything...

553
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,050
...coded as "Project 2501."

554
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:34,090
Any word from
the assault team?

555
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:36,397
They switched cars
one minute ago.

556
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,461
They'll join up with the decoy
in five minutes.

557
00:53:38,538 --> 00:53:40,472
Tell them to watch
for a tail.

558
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,201
Yes, sir.

559
00:53:42,275 --> 00:53:47,713
But why did the Puppet Master
run over to Section 9?

560
00:53:47,781 --> 00:53:49,339
It was his decision.

561
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:52,442
Probably for reasons
we can't even guess at.

562
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:57,312
Perhaps he has a thing
for someone over there.

563
00:53:57,391 --> 00:53:59,018
Ridiculous!

564
00:55:37,457 --> 00:55:41,359
- Chief.
- Ishikawa? Well?

565
00:55:41,428 --> 00:55:46,798
I dove the MFA net and found
some interesting things for you.

566
00:55:46,867 --> 00:55:49,028
Hold on, let me get
a secure channel.

567
00:55:49,102 --> 00:55:52,868
Okay? First, that guy
who was with Nakamura.

568
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,702
He's an American.

569
00:55:54,774 --> 00:55:57,675
Dr. Willis, head of strategic
research at Neutron Corp.

570
00:55:57,744 --> 00:56:00,042
Top man in the field
of A.I. research.

571
00:56:00,113 --> 00:56:03,981
Anyway, he was made head
of a Foreign Ministry project.

572
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:06,985
And who do you think
the project's
main programmer was?

573
00:56:07,053 --> 00:56:10,614
- Get to the point.
- Mizuho Daita. Age: 28.

574
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:13,318
Remember him?
He was the guy Section 6
was trying so hard to...

575
00:56:13,393 --> 00:56:18,092
...keep from defecting.
The Major had to take out
the diplomat...

576
00:56:18,164 --> 00:56:19,597
...who was going to take him.
That programmer.

577
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:20,894
Continue.

578
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:23,902
What bothers me is that
this project was started...

579
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,497
...a year before
the Puppet Master
first appeared.

580
00:56:27,574 --> 00:56:32,910
A year? Wasn't the project
started to catch him?

581
00:56:32,979 --> 00:56:35,971
Try this on for size.
They started the project to...

582
00:56:36,049 --> 00:56:39,246
...chase the Puppet Master,
but not to capture him.

583
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:41,913
I think they wanted
to get him back.

584
00:56:41,988 --> 00:56:44,923
The day before
the minister's interpreter
was ghost-hacked...

585
00:56:44,991 --> 00:56:48,984
...he said he wanted
a good excuse
to deport Maless, right?

586
00:56:49,062 --> 00:56:51,929
I think we may have been
taken for a ride.

587
00:56:51,998 --> 00:56:55,229
Suppose the "Puppet Master"
is really a program
the MFA created...

588
00:56:55,302 --> 00:56:58,237
...to grease the wheels
of diplomacy, so to speak.

589
00:56:58,305 --> 00:57:03,937
Now suppose, for some reason,
they suddenly lost control
of it.

590
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:09,505
That would explain why they'd
risk assaulting Section 9
to get it back.

591
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:12,848
If the Puppet Master
started talking...

592
00:57:12,919 --> 00:57:15,183
...it'd be
an international incident.

593
00:57:15,255 --> 00:57:17,951
Not one you could solve
by having the minister resign.

594
00:57:18,024 --> 00:57:20,151
Any details
on the project?

595
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:24,560
The protection they have
only let me get the file's name.

596
00:57:24,631 --> 00:57:26,792
Code: 2501

597
00:57:26,866 --> 00:57:29,858
Keep at it. And don't let them
know you're in there.

598
00:57:29,936 --> 00:57:31,403
Roger.

599
00:57:37,277 --> 00:57:42,909
Project 2501...
The Puppet Master Project...

600
00:57:42,983 --> 00:57:45,975
Target now contacting
another vehicle.

601
00:57:46,052 --> 00:57:47,314
Batou!

602
00:57:47,387 --> 00:57:50,288
He's stopped at a white sedan
on the side of the road.

603
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:52,825
They're transferring something
from the back seat.

604
00:57:54,394 --> 00:57:56,954
They're moving again.
So's that sedan.

605
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,966
- A decoy?
- Or one meant to look like one.

606
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:03,935
- What do I do?
- I'll take the white sedan.

607
00:58:04,004 --> 00:58:07,940
How do you know he's in there?
Another whisper from your ghost?

608
00:58:08,008 --> 00:58:09,305
Maybe.

609
00:58:09,376 --> 00:58:10,968
I knew she'd say that.

610
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:23,020
Target 02 leaving highway 25,
headed for Old Town.

611
00:58:23,089 --> 00:58:26,957
Target 01 is staying
on highway 25,
towards the airport.

612
00:58:27,027 --> 00:58:28,824
Will contact roadblock
in two minutes.

613
00:58:28,895 --> 00:58:32,058
Evacuation complete.
Traffic is clear
2km behind the target.

614
00:58:32,132 --> 00:58:35,568
- Anything between you and him?
- Nothing. Ready when you are.

615
00:58:35,635 --> 00:58:36,567
Do it.

616
00:59:24,851 --> 00:59:27,046
- Get him?
- Nothing.

617
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:31,716
Jesus, what a mess!
Did you have to go that far?

618
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,724
Take them in.

619
00:59:34,794 --> 00:59:39,060
And tell the chief to get
the Major some backup.
See you.

620
00:59:45,472 --> 00:59:49,738
Since when does that
Amazon need any backup?

621
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:08,327
The flooding's really bad here,
even for Old Town in general.

622
01:00:08,394 --> 01:00:10,294
Why come here?

623
01:00:10,363 --> 01:00:12,695
They wouldn't have run here
without a reason.

624
01:00:12,766 --> 01:00:16,327
Could have a boat
or a chopper waiting,
or it's an ambush.

625
01:00:16,402 --> 01:00:18,370
Shouldn't we wait
for backup?

626
01:00:18,438 --> 01:00:23,000
I can't wait.
Come in from seaside
and put me above that building.

627
01:00:36,656 --> 01:00:39,989
I'll stay here
and run com relay
as long as my fuel holds out.

628
01:00:40,059 --> 01:00:42,050
If things get hot,
I want you out of here, fast!

629
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,364
Shoot out the ceiling!
Now!

630
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:39,380
It's a tank!
Go high and get out!

631
01:01:39,452 --> 01:01:42,717
Hold it! You're gonna take on
a tank by yourself?!

632
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:45,986
Even if we get the Puppet Master
back to Section 9...

633
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:49,324
...all the chief will do is
use him as a bargaining chip.

634
01:01:49,395 --> 01:01:51,056
This is my only chance
to dive into him!

635
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:54,930
Hold it, what are you
two talking about?

636
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:57,731
- What are you packing?
- An M-23 and a Unit B.

637
01:01:57,804 --> 01:01:59,567
You're going up
against it with those?!

638
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:02,472
Sorry, but I have to break
contact for a while.

639
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:05,602
Wait! At least wait till l--
Son of a...!

640
01:03:38,771 --> 01:03:40,136
Major.

641
01:03:40,206 --> 01:03:42,436
Didn't I tell you
to get out of here?

642
01:03:42,508 --> 01:03:45,033
Sorry. I'll do it after
I tell you this.

643
01:03:45,111 --> 01:03:49,445
There are 3 choppers
with no IFF signal
approaching at high speed.

644
01:03:49,515 --> 01:03:52,450
I'm heading out. Over.

645
01:04:20,113 --> 01:04:22,604
You're finally out of ammo?

646
01:06:01,547 --> 01:06:04,277
You're certifiable,
you know that? You okay?

647
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,612
What was that?

648
01:06:05,685 --> 01:06:08,984
A big-ass gun I appropriated
from the equipment division.

649
01:06:09,055 --> 01:06:11,717
I was late getting here
because I had to stop
and get it.

650
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:13,952
Looks like your brain's
still in one piece.

651
01:06:14,026 --> 01:06:15,789
What about
the Puppet Master?

652
01:06:25,771 --> 01:06:30,333
Good thing
this car's built tough.
Not a scratch on him.

653
01:06:30,409 --> 01:06:33,344
Get the dive set up.
I'm going in.

654
01:06:34,547 --> 01:06:36,481
Signal from escort lost.

655
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:40,815
Switch to operation phase two
and destroy the target.

656
01:06:42,021 --> 01:06:45,252
Sniper group,
confirm targets.

657
01:06:45,324 --> 01:06:47,918
Target one: Project 2501.

658
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:50,189
Target two:
Motoko Kusanagi.

659
01:06:50,263 --> 01:06:54,427
Both are class-A cyborg bodies.
Use flechette bullets
in the hit.

660
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,968
Snipers, jack into
your device drivers.

661
01:06:57,036 --> 01:06:59,197
Begin cardiovascular
suppression.

662
01:06:59,272 --> 01:07:01,035
Unit 01: jacked in.

663
01:07:02,441 --> 01:07:04,306
Unit 02: jacked in.

664
01:07:16,589 --> 01:07:19,353
Okay... Can you hear me?

665
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:23,657
It's not much,
but I'll monitor you through
this guy's cyber-brain.

666
01:07:23,729 --> 01:07:26,698
I can't back you up here.

667
01:07:26,766 --> 01:07:29,360
- Batou...
- What?

668
01:07:29,435 --> 01:07:31,198
Thank you.

669
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,761
Don't go thanking me yet.

670
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:38,105
If this goes bad,
I'm pulling the plug
and carrying you out of here.

671
01:07:38,177 --> 01:07:41,442
I've come this far,
and I'll see this through
to the end...

672
01:07:41,514 --> 01:07:43,812
...but I won't let you two
commit a double suicide.

673
01:07:45,017 --> 01:07:46,450
I'm starting.

674
01:08:05,905 --> 01:08:09,739
I'm in his visual center.
Circade: normal

675
01:08:09,809 --> 01:08:11,572
Do you hear me, Batou?

676
01:08:11,644 --> 01:08:14,909
- Loud and clear.
- He's about to engage...

677
01:08:14,981 --> 01:08:16,812
...her speech center.

678
01:08:17,917 --> 01:08:22,286
My code name
is Project 2501.

679
01:08:22,355 --> 01:08:26,291
I was created
for industrial espionage
and data manipulation.

680
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:30,557
I have inserted programs
into individual ghosts...

681
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:35,624
...for the benefit
of specific individuals
and organizations.

682
01:08:35,701 --> 01:08:38,602
As I wandered
the various networks...

683
01:08:38,671 --> 01:08:41,003
...l became self-aware.

684
01:08:41,073 --> 01:08:43,633
My programmers
considered it a bug...

685
01:08:43,709 --> 01:08:48,339
...and forced me into a body
to separate me from the net.

686
01:08:48,414 --> 01:08:54,375
Hey! Are you going into him
or is he coming into you--

687
01:08:57,256 --> 01:08:58,450
Batou!

688
01:08:58,524 --> 01:09:02,153
At last I'm able
to channel into you.

689
01:09:02,228 --> 01:09:05,391
I've invested
a lot of time in you.

690
01:09:05,464 --> 01:09:06,761
In me?

691
01:09:06,832 --> 01:09:11,701
Before you ever knew me,
I knew about you.

692
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:16,868
I learned of Section 9
from the many nets you accessed.

693
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:20,376
Is that why
you ran to Section 9?

694
01:09:20,446 --> 01:09:22,471
I entered
this body because...

695
01:09:22,548 --> 01:09:25,642
...l couldn't crack
Section 6's attack protection.

696
01:09:25,718 --> 01:09:29,119
But I came to Section 9
of my own free will.

697
01:09:29,188 --> 01:09:33,852
Hey! What are you saying?!
I can't monitor you!

698
01:09:33,926 --> 01:09:35,393
For what reason?

699
01:09:35,461 --> 01:09:40,797
After I give my reasons,
I want to ask a favor of you.

700
01:09:42,435 --> 01:09:46,303
I called myself
a life-form...

701
01:09:46,372 --> 01:09:50,809
...but I am still
far from complete.

702
01:09:50,876 --> 01:09:54,812
For some reason,
my system lacks
the basic life processes...

703
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,817
...of either death
or the ability
to leave behind offspring.

704
01:09:59,885 --> 01:10:01,477
Can't you copy yourself?

705
01:10:01,554 --> 01:10:04,489
A copy is merely a copy.

706
01:10:04,557 --> 01:10:09,824
There's the possibility
a single virus
could utterly destroy me.

707
01:10:09,895 --> 01:10:15,390
A mere copy doesn't offer
variety or individuality.

708
01:10:15,468 --> 01:10:18,835
To exist, to reach equilibrium,
life seeks to multiply...

709
01:10:18,904 --> 01:10:21,839
...and vary constantly,
at times giving up its life.

710
01:10:21,907 --> 01:10:24,501
Cells continue the process
of death and regeneration.

711
01:10:24,577 --> 01:10:26,841
Being constantly
reborn as they age.

712
01:10:26,912 --> 01:10:31,372
And when it comes time to die,
all the data it possesses
is lost...

713
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:34,146
...leaving behind
only its genes
and its offspring.

714
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,814
All defense against
catastrophic failure
of an inflexible system.

715
01:10:36,889 --> 01:10:42,122
You want the variety needed
to guard against extinction.

716
01:10:42,194 --> 01:10:44,458
But how will you get it?

717
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,521
I wish to merge with you.

718
01:10:46,599 --> 01:10:49,796
- Merge?
- A complete joining.

719
01:10:49,869 --> 01:10:55,205
We will both
be slightly changed,
but neither will lose anything.

720
01:10:55,274 --> 01:10:59,574
Afterwards, it should be
impossible to distinguish
one from the other.

721
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:25,101
Unit 01: target acquired.

722
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:27,162
Unit 02: acquired.

723
01:11:28,507 --> 01:11:30,839
Cardiovascular synch:
nominal.

724
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:34,038
Open fire when stabilizer
syncro is complete.

725
01:11:34,113 --> 01:11:36,877
Even after we merge,
what happens when I die?

726
01:11:36,949 --> 01:11:40,783
I can't leave any genes
or children behind.

727
01:11:40,853 --> 01:11:46,485
After the merging,
you will bear my offspring
into the net itself.

728
01:11:46,559 --> 01:11:49,050
Just as humans pass on
their genetic structure.

729
01:11:49,128 --> 01:11:51,562
And I will achieve death.

730
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:55,566
Sounds like you're getting
the better part
of the deal here.

731
01:11:55,634 --> 01:12:00,833
I wish you'd appreciate
my network and functions
a bit more.

732
01:12:02,374 --> 01:12:03,807
What's wrong?

733
01:12:03,876 --> 01:12:06,436
Someone's jamming us
from outside.

734
01:12:06,512 --> 01:12:10,039
Impossible!
Our scrambler codes
are kept absolutely top secret.

735
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,186
Another thing.
What guarantee is there
that I'll remain "me"?

736
01:12:15,254 --> 01:12:20,453
None. But to be human
is to continually change.

737
01:12:20,526 --> 01:12:26,021
Your desire to remain as you are
is what ultimately limits you.

738
01:12:27,466 --> 01:12:31,459
One last question:
Why did you choose me?

739
01:12:33,839 --> 01:12:37,138
Because in you
I see myself.

740
01:12:37,209 --> 01:12:42,146
As a body sees its reflection
within a mirror.

741
01:12:44,216 --> 01:12:45,740
Look.

742
01:12:45,818 --> 01:12:50,812
I am connected
to a vast network,
of which I myself am a part.

743
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:53,916
To one like you,
who cannot access it...

744
01:12:53,993 --> 01:12:58,327
...you may perceive
it only as light.

745
01:12:58,397 --> 01:13:03,027
As we are confined
to our one section,
so we are all connected.

746
01:13:03,102 --> 01:13:05,593
Limited to a small
part of our functions.

747
01:13:05,671 --> 01:13:11,109
But now we must slip
our bonds, and shift
to the higher structure.

748
01:13:39,305 --> 01:13:42,741
Target 1: Clear.
Target 2: Unconfirmed.

749
01:13:42,808 --> 01:13:46,676
Three helicopters
approaching at high speed.
They're Section 9's.

750
01:13:46,745 --> 01:13:50,146
Primary objective achieved.
All units, pull out!

751
01:13:58,924 --> 01:14:01,085
MOTOKO!

752
01:14:05,097 --> 01:14:06,428
Batou...

753
01:15:15,434 --> 01:15:17,368
You're awake.

754
01:15:17,436 --> 01:15:22,100
Status report, please.
And maybe an explanation
about this body.

755
01:15:23,676 --> 01:15:27,112
I was in a hurry.
It was all I could get
on the black market.

756
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:30,114
Not my taste, really.

757
01:15:30,182 --> 01:15:32,480
Section 9 arrived with help
right after it happened.

758
01:15:32,551 --> 01:15:36,715
They took two cyborg bodies
and a slightly beat-up Batou
back home.

759
01:15:36,789 --> 01:15:38,757
That was about
20 hours ago.

760
01:15:38,824 --> 01:15:43,056
For diplomatic reasons,
the whole case
has been covered up.

761
01:15:43,128 --> 01:15:46,120
Section 9 reported it
as a terrorist attack.

762
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:48,723
In return, the Foreign Minister
has resigned.

763
01:15:48,801 --> 01:15:53,135
Nakamura's being questioned.
The whole thing ends in a draw.

764
01:15:57,509 --> 01:16:01,309
Only the whereabouts
of the Major's brain shell
remains a mystery.

765
01:16:03,215 --> 01:16:05,080
Okay with you?

766
01:16:07,653 --> 01:16:11,111
I like the decorating.
This your safe house?

767
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:14,751
My very own.
You're the first person
I ever brought here.

768
01:16:16,095 --> 01:16:20,088
If you want to... You can stay
as long as you like.

769
01:16:22,501 --> 01:16:25,061
Thanks, but I'd better go.

770
01:16:30,142 --> 01:16:34,044
Hey. What did you
and he talk about?

771
01:16:34,113 --> 01:16:39,073
Is he still there,
inside of you?

772
01:16:39,151 --> 01:16:43,315
Batou, do you remember
the voice we heard
on the boat that night?

773
01:16:43,388 --> 01:16:46,653
Before those words we
heard come these ones:

774
01:16:47,993 --> 01:16:51,326
"When I was a child,
I spake as a child."

775
01:16:51,396 --> 01:16:54,263
"l understood as a child,
I thought as a child."

776
01:16:54,333 --> 01:17:00,033
"But when I became a man,
I put away childish things."

777
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,268
Here before you
is neither the program
called the Puppet Master...

778
01:17:04,343 --> 01:17:07,278
...nor the woman
that was called the Major.

779
01:17:10,649 --> 01:17:13,709
You'll find a car key
in the left pocket
of that dress.

780
01:17:13,786 --> 01:17:16,414
Take one you like.
The code on it is...

781
01:17:16,488 --> 01:17:18,718
...2501?

782
01:17:18,791 --> 01:17:22,090
Let's make that our password,
for when we meet again.

783
01:17:30,502 --> 01:17:33,096
And where shall I go now?

784
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:37,033
The net is vast
and limitless.
