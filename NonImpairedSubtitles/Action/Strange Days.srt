as an execution-style killing.

326
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:24,637
The body
of an unidentified woman...

327
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,234
was found with them,
also shot numerous times.

328
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:30,576
Police said the killings
appearto be gang-related.

329
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:32,582
With his band,
Prophets of Light...

330
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,585
Jeriko One's outspoken political
stance and violent lyrics...

331
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,383
have stirred nationwide
controversy.

332
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:41,386
Meanwhile,
astrologers have been busy...

333
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,086
making predictions
for the coming century.

334
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,254
Some of their fortune-telling
is indeed incredible--

335
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,959
Muammar Qaddafi will be awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize.

336
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:52,434
Turkey will make
reparations to Armenia.

337
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:55,563
By 2025,there will be
a second woman president...

338
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:08,114
-Hey, Lenny.
-How ya doin', man?

339
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:09,516
Hey, man.

340
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,655
Keith.

341
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,893
-Keith?
-Yeah.

342
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:18,929
Hi. Lenny. Lenny Nero.

343
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:20,759
We spoke on the phone. Hi.

344
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:22,992
OK.

345
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:30,733
Not to be rude, but I gotta ask.
Are you a cop?

346
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:33,003
I understand. No, I'm not.

347
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:36,171
You understand. Attorney, right?

348
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:38,647
That's right.

349
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:42,345
Tassel shoes. Entertainment law
would be my guess.

350
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,355
It's my job to know people
and what they want...

351
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:47,357
what's behind their eyes.

352
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:50,792
OK, so tell me,
have you everjacked in?

353
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:53,421
Have you everwire-tripped?

354
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,199
No.

355
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:59,668
A virgin brain.
We're gonna start you off right.

356
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:02,706
Just save us some time,
tell me what you know.

357
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:04,172
Just what I've read.

358
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:07,176
That the technology
was developed for the Feds...

359
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:11,840
to replace the body wire,
and now it's gone black market.

360
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,850
That's right, so...

361
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:16,614
this conversation's
not taking place, OK?

362
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:19,178
-Damn right it's not.
-Good.

363
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:22,282
Do I get the deck from you?

364
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,090
I'll get you a deck at my cost.
My thing is the software.

365
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,220
Clips, right?

366
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:27,924
Clips. Right.

367
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,637
Listen, I want you to know
what we're talking about here.

368
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:36,639
This is not
"like TV, only better."

369
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:39,801
This is life.

370
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:42,072
It's a piece of somebody's life.

371
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:45,980
It's pure and uncut, straight
from the cerebral cortex.

372
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,143
You're there. You're doing it.

373
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,982
You're seeing it, hearing it.

374
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,155
You're feeling it.

375
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:51,621
You're feeling it.

376
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:56,181
What kind of things, exactly?

377
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,694
Anything. Whatever you want,
whoever you wanna be.

378
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:01,994
Want to go skiing without
leaving your den,you can...

379
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,330
but I'm assuming
that a guy like you...

380
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:06,666
you want to ski,
you fly to Aspen.

381
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:08,671
That's not what
you're interested in.

382
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:09,706
It's...

383
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,174
It's about the stuff
that you can't have, right?

384
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:17,339
The forbidden fruit, hmm?

385
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:20,350
Running into a liquor store with
a .357 Magnum in your hand...

386
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:23,615
feeling the adrenaline
pumping through yourveins, huh?

387
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:28,625
Or see that guy with the
drop-dead Filipino girlfriend?

388
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:31,856
Wouldn'tyou like to be
that guy fortwenty minutes?

389
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:33,362
The right twenty minutes.

390
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,331
I can make it happen...

391
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,560
and you won't even tarnish
your wedding ring.

392
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:42,365
Sounds good.

393
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,307
I can get you what you want.

394
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:48,004
I can get you anything.
Just talk to me.

395
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,571
You have to trust me, OK?
'Cause I'm your priest.

396
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:53,207
I'm your shrink.

397
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:57,380
I am your main connection
to the switch board of souls.

398
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:00,982
I'm the Magic Man.

399
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:04,050
The Santa Claus
of the subconscious.

400
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:07,256
You say it,
you think it,you can have it.

401
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:11,497
You want a girl?

402
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:12,763
You want two girls?

403
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:17,503
I don't know what your thing is,
what you're curious about.

404
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:18,974
You want a guy?

405
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:22,672
Maybe you want to be a girl.

406
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:25,545
Hey,think of that. Be a girl.

407
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:26,947
See what that feels like.

408
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:29,781
Maybe you want a nun
to tie you up.

409
00:22:29,854 --> 00:22:31,685
It's all doable.

410
00:22:32,723 --> 00:22:34,281
Talk to me about costs.

411
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:37,623
Before we get into numbers,
I want you to try a taste.

412
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:39,595
I got a deck with me.

413
00:22:39,663 --> 00:22:42,131
-Right here?
-Step into my office.

414
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,325
[Gasps]

415
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:45,997
Ohh.

416
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,196
Ohh.

417
00:23:05,956 --> 00:23:06,980
Ahh.

418
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:11,187
Ooh.

419
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:14,898
[Turns off]

420
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:22,405
You were just an 18-year-old
girl taking a shower.

421
00:23:22,473 --> 00:23:25,670
Are you beginning to see
the possibilities here?

422
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:09,345
MAX: Hey. So,where is he?

423
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,583
-In the back making a deal.
-Oh.

424
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:14,021
KEITH: Nexttime, let's meet
someplace less public.

425
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:15,149
LENNY: Nervous? Don't be.

426
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:17,694
Cops have more to worry about
than the SQUID trade.

427
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:18,887
MAX: Oh,yeah?

428
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:21,830
Assume the position,
you miserable techno-perv puke.

429
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,197
Beat it,fuckwad! Uhh!

430
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:27,897
Max, I was with a client!
You think that'sfunny?

431
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:29,269
Prick.

432
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,207
MAX: See the look
on that preppy puke'sface?

433
00:24:32,276 --> 00:24:33,903
Pissed all over his Topsiders.

434
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:36,572
LENNY: It was funny,
but it cost me money.

435
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:39,081
MAX: Come on, amigo.
The world'sfull of marks.

436
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:41,344
No one knows how to work them
like you do, pal.

437
00:24:41,418 --> 00:24:44,581
You could sell a rat's asshole
for a wedding ring.

438
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:46,350
LENNY: Yeah, I could.

439
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:50,291
MAX: Let me buy you a drink.
Bobby!

440
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:52,022
Bobby!

441
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:54,087
Tequila, porfavor.
Double shots.

442
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:56,291
Make it a Tres Generaciones.

443
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:58,301
Nothing but the best
for Lenny...

444
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:01,270
the finest cop to ever get
thrown off the vice squad.

445
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:03,898
-Fuck you.
-Ha ha ha!

446
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:07,740
Whoo. Yeah, nice tie.

447
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:08,971
LENNY: Thanks, Max.

448
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:10,775
MAX: You always got to dress
like a fucking pimp?

449
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,907
This tie cost more
than your entire wardrobe.

450
00:25:13,584 --> 00:25:14,812
MAX: That's not saying much.

451
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:15,977
LENNY: It's the one thing...

452
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:17,486
that stands between me
and the fucking jungle.

453
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:18,816
MAX: To the jungle...

454
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:21,983
where some shit bird
can cap you in the head...

455
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,583
and that'll ruin
your whole day.

456
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:25,322
You were lucky, Max.

457
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:29,457
So darned lucky, I wake up with
a twenty-two in my brainpan...

458
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:32,593
and a cop pension
I can't live off of.

459
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,468
Damn! It's a good thing
I wasn't luckier.

460
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,507
[Laughing]

461
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:40,702
Bobby, hit me again.
You seen Faith lately?

462
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:43,542
-She won't call me.
-Just as well.

463
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:46,208
Sure, Faith was
the most outstanding woman...

464
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:47,875
a guy like you
could ever hope to get...

465
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:51,149
and it's completely humiliating
that she's gone...

466
00:25:51,221 --> 00:25:54,486
but you got to face
that it's over.

467
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,822
Thanks, chaplain.
I'm touched by your concern.

468
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:59,522
I just hate to see you
pining away, man.

469
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:02,531
You're myfriend.
It makes me want to vomit.

Hey, lris. You OK?

471
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:08,835
I gotta talk to you.
It's serious.

00:26:08,906 --> 00:26:11,704
MAX: What happened, honey?
Some john get rough on you?

473
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:14,300
No. I mean,talk private.
Please?

474
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:17,142
I'm in trouble. So is Faith.

475
00:26:17,214 --> 00:26:18,647
MAX:
There's the magic fucking word.

to your car, please?

477

There's something
you have to see.

LENNY: What's going on?

479
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:29,219
-It's a bad situation.
-What?

480
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:31,022
If they get me,
I know they'll...

481
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:32,289

802

I missed you.

Lenny,you have to leave.
I mean it.

804
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:34,903
LENNY:
Iris said you were in trouble.

805
00:45:34,971 --> 00:45:37,633
-You talked to lris? When?
-Tonight.

806
00:45:37,707 --> 00:45:40,938
I haven't seen her in months.
What the fuck would she know?

807
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:43,001
Who knows what's going on
in that whore's head?

808

LENNY: She used to be
your best friend.

809
00:45:45,014 --> 00:45:47,983
FAITH: You're really
running out of excuses...

810
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,608
to come around, aren't you?

811
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:50,617
I know you, Faith.

812
00:45:50,686 --> 00:45:53,553
You're afraid of something.
What's going on?

813
00:45:53,623 --> 00:45:56,387
Just let it alone, Lenny.
It'll take care of itself.

814
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:59,451
It's Gant, isn't it?
This guy is poison.

815
00:45:59,529 --> 00:46:02,396
He's got you walled in.
He uses the wire too much.

816
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:04,899
He gets off on tape,
not on you.

817

That's a good one
coming from you.

818

-I don't want to.
-Do you love him?

820

LENNY: I don't think so.

821
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,137
To him,you're some kind
of possession.

822

You're like a Ferrari.

823

You're just something
to show the other guys.

824

FAITH: Yeah?
He has his uses,too,you know.

825
00:46:24,854 --> 00:46:27,823
LENNY: What? He gonna
record you on his label?

826
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:31,189
He might.
You never know, right?

827
00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:34,223
Faith...

828
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:36,894
Faith, listen to me.

829
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:39,560
I've watched you create yourself
out of nothing.

830
00:46:39,635 --> 00:46:42,069
You're like
a goddamn cruise missile...

831

LENNY: It's you
up on that stage, not him.

834
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,277
You don't need him.

835
00:46:55,418 --> 00:46:56,851
You have to get out of here.

836
00:46:56,919 --> 00:46:59,149
If Philo catches you,
he's gonna hurt you.

837

I'm already hurting.

838
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:02,619
FAITH: No, I'm serious.
He's acting crazy.

839
00:47:02,692 --> 00:47:05,286
He's doing
way too much playback.

840
00:47:05,361 --> 00:47:06,794
He's gotten completely paranoid.

841
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:08,796
He's such a controlfreak now...

842
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:11,662
he's even paying Max
to follow me around.

843
00:47:11,734 --> 00:47:13,531
Max? You're kidding.

844
00:47:13,603 --> 00:47:15,298
Yeah,for about a month now.

846
00:47:17,673 --> 00:47:22,007
Look, Lenny,
just stay away from Philo...

847
00:47:22,078 --> 00:47:23,670
and stay away from me.

Stop trying to rescue me.
Those days are over.

849

I'm a big girl now.
I've changed.

850
00:47:28,451 --> 00:47:29,884
Stop trying to save me.

851
00:47:29,952 --> 00:47:32,978
I don't need saving.
Just give up on me!

852
00:47:34,657 --> 00:47:37,785
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

853
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:44,732
You know why movies
are still better than playback?

854
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,099
'Cause the music comes up,
there's credits...

855
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,331

when it's over.

MAX: Hey, man.
I know what you're thinking.

859
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,558
She told me about your new gig.

860
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:12,253
It's just a job.
I feel like shit about it.

861
00:48:12,328 --> 00:48:15,695
-You should feel like shit.
-I do.

862
00:48:15,765 --> 00:48:17,460
You introduced me
to that prick Gant.

863
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:20,093
I introduced him to Faith,too.
I don't cherish the moment.

864
00:48:20,169 --> 00:48:23,138
Questionable move, given
the historical perspective.

865
00:48:23,205 --> 00:48:25,833
I figured I could take
the prick's money--

866
00:48:25,908 --> 00:48:27,842
you wouldn't believe
what I'm charging him--

867
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,970
and make sure Faith
is OK atthe same time.

For you, OK?

bent the wrong way back.

This does us both some good.

-Hey,you got a job.
-I got a job.

874
00:48:48,297 --> 00:48:51,460
OK. I'm sorry. You got a job.
That's great.

875
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:54,602
Listen,you got to stay on her.

one!

2076
02:15:49,924 --> 02:15:51,050
Whoo!

2077
02:16:05,140 --> 02:16:06,698
MEDIC: You need an ambulance.
Let's go this way.

2078
02:16:07,475 --> 02:16:08,908
Come on this way, sir.

2079
02:16:11,980 --> 02:16:13,470
Hey, Lenny,we made it.

2080
02:16:17,886 --> 02:16:19,945
Yeah,we did.

2081
02:16:27,028 --> 02:16:28,188
You should get going.

2082
02:16:29,964 --> 02:16:31,295
Yeah.

2083
02:16:31,366 --> 02:16:32,594
See you downtown.

2084
02:16:32,667 --> 02:16:33,793
See you there.

2085
02:16:36,871 --> 02:16:38,270
MEDIC: Make way!

2086

LORI CARSON SINGING:
Ahh

2087
02:16:56,057 --> 02:16:58,116
Ahhh

2088
02:16:59,861 --> 02:17:01,692
Ahhh

2089
02:17:05,934 --> 02:17:10,837
Ahhhh

2090
02:17:20,548 --> 02:17:24,507
Ahhh

2091
02:17:29,791 --> 02:17:32,385
Pretend there's no night

2092
02:17:33,228 --> 02:17:36,288
Hold on

2093
02:17:36,364 --> 02:17:37,854
Everything has

2094
02:17:37,932 --> 02:17:40,127
Come apart

2095
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:45,003
But in this moment

2096
02:17:45,874 --> 02:17:48,240
Right now

2097
02:17:48,309 --> 02:17:50,641
When it can come together

2098
02:17:54,682 --> 02:17:59,984
Makes no sense

2099
02:18:00,054 --> 02:18:04,650
What's there to lose?

2100
02:18:06,928 --> 02:18:09,897
Fall in the light

2101
02:18:09,964 --> 02:18:12,831
Fall in the light

2102
02:18:12,901 --> 02:18:19,067
Fall in the light

2103
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:21,836
Will you catch me
if I'mfalling?

2104
02:18:21,910 --> 02:18:23,468
Will you catch me?

2105
02:18:24,612 --> 02:18:27,342
Hold on...hold on

2106
02:18:29,017 --> 02:18:29,751
Hold on

2107
02:18:29,751 --> 02:18:30,513
Hold on

2108
02:18:30,585 --> 02:18:31,711
Will you catch me?

2109
02:18:34,622 --> 02:18:37,614
