1
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,784
"In the fourth month
of the Year of the Snake...

2
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,718
...a child shall be chosen...

3
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:07,986
...to meld the two halves of the sacred
medallion together as one.

4
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,252
And at his touch...

5
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,591
...the reborn shall be endowed...

6
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:18,327
...with extraordinary
supernatural powers."

7
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,241
You've done well.

8
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,302
As agreed.

9
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,140
Pitiful.

10
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,785
Many people would pay more...

11
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,487
...to be the keeper of such a book.

12
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,159
The only pitiful thing in this room...

13
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,759
...is your life.

14
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,153
Okay.

15
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,427
Actually...

16
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,169
...you have been
quite generous, yeah?

17
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,478
It's nobody you know, okay?

18
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,445
It's fish. See?

19
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,763
Happy now?

20
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,909
Cheers.

21
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,170
In English, please.

22
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:12,333
Stop wasting time, Giscard.
Pull around the back.

23
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,518
Inspector.

24
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,284
Positive ID on Giscard.
Kwun Yum Temple.

25
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,856
- And he's got company.
- Copy that.

26
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,425
Hold your position.

27
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,239
Pai Gow.

28
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,809
It's our guy.

29
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,334
All right, men.

30
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,820
- And Snakehead?
- Snakehead was not confirmed.

31
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,021
We should wait.

32
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,848
My intelligence says he's here...

33
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,582
...and Giscard is his number one.
We're going in.

34
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,254
I did not agree to this.

35
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,796
- We are supposed to be partners.
- This is an Interpol operation.

36
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,729
The Hong Kong
Police Department's...

37
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,529
...involvement is strictly
a babysitting service.

38
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,138
You don't like it,
take it up with your boss.

39
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,619
It's true.

40
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,362
Tell him we found it and we're in.

41
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,953
Full force, men.

42
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,855
Razor-sharp and all that.

43
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,424
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

44
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,635
That's a temple. It's a holy place.

45
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,361
You cannot take guns in there.

46
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,006
Oh, right. Well, don't worry, Eddie,
because you see these guns?

47
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,403
They're holey guns.

48
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,137
Because they make
a rather big holey.

49
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,209
Holey. Do you get it? Holey.

50
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,513
All right.

51
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,756
Move out, men!

52
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,195
Move. Left, right, left, right.
Go, go, go.

53
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,029
Come on, keep up.

54
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,081
Inter...

55
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,692
Freeze!

56
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,086
Damn.

57
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,777
Keep up. Keep up. Keep up.

58
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,574
Interpol! Freeze!

59
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,336
The medallion.

60
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,352
You cannot come in he...

61
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,769
You will give me what I want.

62
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,669
What's that?

63
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,331
Check it out.

64
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,166
- Go that way.
- Got it.

65
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,765
Peter?

66
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,532
Eddie.

67
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,082
Interpol! Fre...

68
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,590
What the he...?

69
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,663
You okay?

70
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,470
This way, men.
Follow me. Down here.

71
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,840
It's the cops!

72
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,976
We've gotta go now!

73
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,548
I need more time.

74
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,180
- We haven't finished yet.
- It's too late.

75
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,517
- We'll try again later!
- Hong Kong Police!

76
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,339
Jai!

77
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,305
Hang on!

78
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,654
Eddie!

79
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,657
Snakehead! Upstairs!

80
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,201
Right!

81
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:44,947
Damn!

82
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,085
Four months' work!

83
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,925
What did he want in the temple?

84
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,298
He's a smuggler, Eddie. I don't know.

85
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,799
Perhaps he's found a buyer for
black-market Buddhas. The point is...

86
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,666
...you let him get away.

87
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,567
Watson.

88
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,576
I also saw his face.

89
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:15,150
Interpol's all over me,
and I can't stay here any longer.

90
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,914
You must bring me the boy in Dublin.

91
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,350
I trust you will make my continued...

92
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,687
Just bring me the boy.

93
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,504
Good job.
Okay, this is what I want.

94
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,303
All right, notify the team...

95
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,607
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

96
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,248
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

97
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,545
Got it. The Sea Horizon.

98
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,568
- Where are you keeping the boy?
- In a safe place.

99
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,397
Very good. Take me to him.

100
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,931
Up there. Okay.

101
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,549
- Where is he?
- Over here.

102
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,852
Wait. Put him down. Put him down!

103
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,653
Untie him. Don't hurt him.

104
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,125
Careful. Be careful.

105
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,898
Inspector, what's going on?

106
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,499
Snakehead's men.

107
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,628
Yes. Hello.

108
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,931
It's the boy.

109
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,838
Good morning, sir.

110
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,172
Show me the boy.

111
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,146
Oh. Of course.

112
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,346
That's him.

113
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,955
Treat him like a prince.

114
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,657
No problem, sir. We are ready to go.

115
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,523
Attention! This is the marine police.

116
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,300
You are ordered to stand down!

117
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,666
Prepare to be boarded.

118
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,428
Attention!

119
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,608
- Showtime!
- This is the marine police.

120
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,368
You are ordered to stand down!

121
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,045
Prepare to be boarded!

122
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,104
This is the marine police.

123
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,976
Look out!

124
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,557
Let's go!

125
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,025
Quickly! Go! Go!

126
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
Are you ready?

127
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,675
I'll cover you.

128
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,178
The boy!

129
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,395
Wave bye-bye!

130
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,038
We've interrogated the prisoner.

131
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,939
The boy's been taken to Snakehead
in Ireland. Repeat, Ireland.

132
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,484
Time for vacation.

133
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:21,808
Call me in Ireland.

134
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,817
Bring me back a snake head.

135
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,359
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes.

136
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,964
I'm Inspector Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

137
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,269
Yes. You have an appointment to the
commander.

138
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,699
Nicole.

139
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,469
Inspector Eddie Yang.

140
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,943
I knew there couldn't be two of you.

141
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,241
Nice.

142
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,049
You clean up well.

143
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:28,520
Thank you.

144
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,563
Come on.

145
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,507
It's been a long time.

146
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,732
Three months.

147
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,004
I was assigned overseas and...

148
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,045
Oh, yeah.

149
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,874
You were gonna call me.

150
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,554
- I didn't know you'd been assigned...
- To Ireland?

151
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,484
- Yes.
- Well, you missed a few beats, Eddie.

152
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,316
I am now the official liaison...

153
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,518
...between the local Interpol office and
Southeast Asian security forces.

154
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,824
Maybe if you stayed in touch
like you promised...

155
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,367
Nicole.

156
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:18,763
I should have called.

157
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:20,328
I'm sorry.

158
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,707
That's worth something.

159
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,877
Not a lot, but something.

160
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,406
Commander?

161
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,045
Inspector Yang is here to see you.

162
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,316
Yes.

163
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,785
I'm Hammerstock-Smythe.
Delighted to meet you, inspector.

164
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:37,921
Likewise, commander.

165
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,889
Commander, I was just...

166
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:48,694
What the bloody hell is he doing here?

167
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,458
Hello, Watson.

168
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,865
You're not telling me he'll be working
on this case?

169
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,902
Watson, we need all the help
we can get.

170
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,311
Yes.

171
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,713
You remember this boy?

172
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,945
Yes, I saw him in the temple. So?

173
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,210
- Who's he?
- One moment.

174
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,788
Yes, I recognize him.

175
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,216
This is Lester Wong.

176
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,161
Snakehead's number two man.

177
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,728
That's privileged information,
eyes-only, need-to-know and all that.

178
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:23,526
- I need to find him, Watson.
- Yes, well, I'm sorry, my friend...

179
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,293
...but that's classified.

180
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,269
We've received a tip-off...

181
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:31,067
...that Snakehead does have a new
shipment arriving tomorrow in Ireland.

182
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,471
- Maybe the boy will come with it.
- Where?

183
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,279
We don't know.

184
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:39,050
Go back East, Eddie.
Stick to what you know.

185
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,787
- Watson!
- What?! I mean... Sorry. What?

186
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,511
Any more nonsense like this...

187
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:48,750
...and you will be off the case, and the
inspector here will be in charge of it.

188
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,887
Satisfied?
You've only been here five minutes.

189
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:58,735
Watson!

190
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,529
You are in my filing cabinet.

191
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,146
Yes.

192
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,918
I was just getting these.

193
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,414
I think we're in trouble.

194
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,595
Yes, I think everything is in order.
What do you think?

195
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,629
Is it? Well, yes.

196
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,324
- Well, let me have it checked out.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,500
Watson, wait.

198
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:36,967
- Let's put Hong Kong behind us.
- I'm sorry, is somebody talking to me?

199
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,939
We were partners.
We were good together.

200
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,640
- You need me.
- Really? What do you want me to do?

201
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,850
Just welcome you back
with open arms?

202
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,814
We had a good thing going,
and you left!

203
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,691
Watson.

204
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,361
It just wasn't for me anymore.

205
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,030
I thought you understood.

206
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,629
Oh, I understand.

207
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,996
I understand that you didn't like me
always being on top.

208
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,405
Okay, you can be on top.
Whatever you want.

209
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,677
Let's just do it together. Okay?

210
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:18,649
No, but you have fun doing it
by yourself. All right?

211
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,687
You think because of the way...

212
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,012
Thank you.

213
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,449
Think we...

214
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,216
Well, we're not.

215
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,014
I'm a man!

216
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,688
Yes. No, there's nothing wrong
when two people love...

217
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,892
...one another.

218
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,720
It's a good thing. I...

219
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,557
That's your fault, that is.

220
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,026
Now, I'm gonna go home
and cook dinner for my wife!

221
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,739
So on a scale of one to 10...

222
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,648
...how did that go?

223
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:29,843
About a seven.

224
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,423
Below zero.

225
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,631
I think I know just what you need.

226
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,734
Dinner.

227
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,398
Dinner?

228
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,936
Yes, dinner.

229
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,074
We need Watson
for this investigation, Eddie.

230
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,777
He's stubborn, but if we can
catch him off guard...

231
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,480
...maybe loosen him up,
I think we can work it out.

232
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:57,943
I'll just be myself.

233
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,916
One more thing.

234
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,982
Watson's family...

235
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,490
...they don't know
that he's an Interpol agent.

236
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,753
- What do they think he is?
- A librarian.

237
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,726
- A librarian?
- Yes.

238
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,301
Hi.

239
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,397
- Nice apron.
- Thanks.

240
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,799
Look, you can't just
turn up and barge in.

241
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,635
Darling, I was wondering
if you saw my spatula.

242
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,278
- Charlotte, hello.
- Hello.

243
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,238
- Please. Please come in. Please.
- Thank you.

244
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,646
Arthur, you didn't tell me we were
having guests.

245
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,821
- Please, welcome.
- Didn't know myself.

246
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,283
- We're librarians.
- Librarian?

247
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,124
Charlotte, this is Eddie Yang
from Hong Kong.

248
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,089
Are you staying for dinner?

249
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,698
- Yes.
- No. Absolutely not.

250
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:50,867
Thank you.

251
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,305
See what you've done to my chops?

252
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,168
What's that called?

253
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:01,744
Now?

254
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,978
"Lamb à la victim."

255
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,921
Right. Well, yes. Come on.
You know the score.

256
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,586
You eat, you work.

257
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,729
What brings you to Dublin?

258
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,899
- Right. I was looking for...
- Looking for a rare book.

259
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,366
Yes, actually, we were wondering...

260
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,232
...if Arthur would help us find this
rare book.

261
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:07,138
Oh, well, unfortunately, I'm looking for
that book myself, so...

262
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,574
Maybe we could find it together.

263
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,612
But I'm head librarian, though, right?

264
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,489
Right.

265
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,540
You need help checking in?

266
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,802
I already checked in.

267
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:40,743
Okay.

268
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,946
Here. Directions.
Where to meet Watson tomorrow.

269
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,781
He told me to give them to you.

270
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,716
Why can't he just pick me up?

271
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,486
It's Watson.

272
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:01,355
"Privileged information, eyes-only,
need-to-know and all that." So...

273
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:07,738
Okay.

274
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,240
Okay.

275
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,211
Nicole.

276
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:15,646
Yeah?

277
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,307
Tonight was fun.

278
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,982
Yeah.

279
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,640
Excuse me.

280
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,507
- Is this place far away or close by?
- Far away.

281
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,145
- Hop in the car and I'll take you.
- Thank you.

282
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,188
What are you doing?

283
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:05,995
Move.

284
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,448
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

285
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,158
- Oh, my!
- Sorry.

286
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,731
Did you see that?

287
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,031
What are you doing?

288
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,306
Open this door!

289
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,334
Hey, what's going on?

290
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,239
Now, mind yourself.

291
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,390
Come on.

292
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,635
Wait a minute.

293
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,406
What are you doing?
I haven't even done any...

294
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,585
Say it!

295
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,254
Talk! Where's the boy?

296
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,457
Let me out of here
or I'll kick your ass.

297
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,251
Speak English! You are hard
to understand!

298
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,224
- You ever hear of police brutality?
- Sounds like fun.

299
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,597
One more chance
until you kick the can.

300
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,428
You mean, "kick the bucket."

301
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,637
- What?
- You mean, "kick the bucket."

302
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,333
If you say so.

303
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,239
What kind of music you like?

304
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,406
Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:37,973
Just let me out and we can talk
about this, all right?

306
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,209
He's coming on a boat. I don't know
what time. A freighter.

307
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,477
- He'll be coming into the docks.
- A boat!

308
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,655
Look, just let me out of here!

309
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,586
Do you know how long I've been
waiting here for you?

310
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,927
What's the matter? You sound like an
obscene phone call.

311
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,293
You're out of shape.

312
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,865
You should keep fit.

313
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,832
Right, but let's not waste any more
time, shall we?

314
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,835
Pier 5. Well, that must be the ship,
if Giscard's telling the truth.

315
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,772
Let's hope so.
It's all we've got to go on.

316
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,290
Now, these are very
dangerous people, all right?

317
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,557
Do you have a gun?

318
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,066
No, are you going to give me one?

319
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,861
No, get your own bloody gun.

320
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,269
And remember,
I'm head librarian, all right?

321
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,600
- All right?
- Yes.

322
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,768
Right.

323
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,181
Here's the plan.

324
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,642
I'll circle around to the left.
You circle ar...

325
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,413
You circle arou...

326
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,884
And I'll just bloody talk to myself.

327
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,927
Then you go straight through.
Go around.

328
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,768
Welcome, Chosen One.

329
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,231
Excuse me.

330
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:13,836
You're under arrest.

331
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,049
Come on! He went this way!

332
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:42,456
Have you seen him?

333
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,433
There.

334
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,939
Watson, come on!

335
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:04,845
Where's the boy?

336
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,784
- We couldn't find him.
- Find him!

337
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,194
Shoot him.

338
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,109
You okay?

339
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,512
Go, go, go, go! Get the boy!

340
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:41,852
Interpol! Freeze!

341
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,171
- Hello?
- Hello, it's me.

342
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,379
Me, who?

343
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,840
Eddie! Where are you?

344
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,546
I'm trapped inside the container
with the boy.

345
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,015
Stay right where you are.
I'm on my way.

346
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,121
What color is it?

347
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,457
I don't know.

348
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,329
Watson.

349
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,200
- Eddie's in a container.
- Which one?

350
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,864
I have absolutely no idea.

351
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,048
There! There!

352
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,575
It's Eddie.

353
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,102
Eddie.

354
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,769
Eddie, it's Nicole. Just hang on.

355
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,281
Watson, get over here.
I need your help!

356
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,415
Nicole!

357
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,164
Oh, my God!

358
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,572
Don't be afraid.

359
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,073
I'm not afraid.

360
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,484
We'll be all right.

361
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,508
We got control of the container. We
believe that there's bodies inside.

362
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,355
I need an oxygen tank
and a stretcher. Now!

363
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,865
Eddie, please don't leave me, Eddie.

364
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,730
Eddie, come back to me.
Eddie, please.

365
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,340
- You all right?
- Please.

366
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,274
Eddie, come back.

367
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,045
Nicole...

368
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,018
...he's gone.

369
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,395
Come on.

370
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,805
God bless, Eddie.

371
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,142
God bless.

372
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,613
Nicole.

373
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,510
- We've got work to do.
- You sure?

374
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,151
I'm sure.

375
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:09,808
Let's go.

376
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:41,946
I'm sorry...

377
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,891
...I wasn't there when you needed me
most, my friend.

378
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,820
That was nice.

379
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,827
Thank you. I...

380
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:58,266
- What's wrong?
- Who are you?

381
00:43:58,502 --> 00:43:59,628
What's the matter?

382
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:02,133
Who are you? What...?

383
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:05,137
What are we doing here?
Where's my clothes?

384
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:08,678
Watson.

385
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,112
Watson.

386
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,620
- Watson!
- Get away from me!

387
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,628
It must be fake.

388
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,223
Well, it certainly looks like you.

389
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,298
My nose isn't that big.

390
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:37,498
It's really me.

391
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:38,673
Are you sure?

392
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,877
Don't you think I recognize
my own thing?

393
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,976
It's cold in here.
Let me take a look.

394
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,308
- What's happening to me?
- All right.

395
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,711
Let's just...

396
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,648
...stay calm.

397
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:56,457
I'm sure there's a perfectly rational
explanation for this. Think back.

398
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,219
You were on the boat,
in the container.

399
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,487
What happened?

400
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:02,699
Lights everywhere.

401
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,326
- The boy.
- The boy?

402
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,268
- Medallion.
- Yes.

403
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,699
I have it. It was in your pocket.

404
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,906
What's this?

405
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,450
Wow.
