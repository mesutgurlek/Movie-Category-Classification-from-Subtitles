1
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,814
<i>Scorpion-class pulse warriors.</i>

2
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,550
<i>Kamikaze bombardiers.</i>

3
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,279
<i>Every day,</i>
<i>new Bugs show up on the battlefield.</i>

4
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,249
Watch out! Get down, get down!

5
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,428
<i>So many that some wonder:</i>

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,888
GIQ on one.

7
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,533
<i>Don't bet on it, citizen.</i>

8
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,430
<i>Here at Oppenheimer</i>
<i>Proving Grounds...</i>

9
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,970
<i>... federal scientists are cooking up</i>
<i>some nasty top-secret surprises...</i>

10
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,835
<i>... of their own.</i>

11
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,143
<i>But the newest weapon</i>
<i>in the Mobile Infantry's arsenal...</i>

12
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,080
<i>... is the not-so-secret shovel.</i>

13
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,152
<i>Greater Bug firepower</i>
<i>means trenches.</i>

14
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,220
<i>And that means digging</i>
<i>here on Roku San...</i>

15
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,051
<i>... this once peaceful farm planet...</i>

16
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,092
<i>... that has become the new frontline</i>
<i>of the Second Bug War.</i>

17
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,788
<i>There you go, trooper.</i>
<i>And put your back into it.</i>

18
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,463
<i>If you're against the war,</i>
<i>you're against us.</i>

19
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,703
<i>That's what a federal judge</i>
<i>said today...</i>

20
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,671
<i>... when he declared that hanging</i>
<i>is absolutely good enough...</i>

21
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,471
<i>... for anyone who threatens</i>
<i>the morale of the Federation.</i>

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,910
- and death. Execute them all.

23
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,811
This is a very simple ruling.
People need to watch what they say.

24
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,751
<i>Admiral Enolo Phid,</i>
<i>division chief, Fleet Intelligence...</i>

25
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,359
<i>... voiced another concern from her</i>
<i>headquarters at Terran Command.</i>

26
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:12,122
The revival of religious worship here
and in the outer colonies...

27
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,768
...will not be tolerated
if it leads to sedition...

28
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,461
...or in any other way
destabilizes our war effort.

29
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,405
<i>He's dark, he's handsome,</i>
<i>he's psychic.</i>

30
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,274
<i>Courage, duty, honor</i>

31
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,709
<i>Eagle high above</i>

32
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,352
<i>He's General Omar Anoke,</i>
<i>the sky marshal everyone loves.</i>

33
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,522
<i>And gives us strength</i>
<i>To go and win this war</i>

34
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,156
<i>And at last night's war rally...</i>

35
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,758
<i>... he thrilled audiences</i>
<i>all across the Federation...</i>

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,396
<i>... with a pounding rendition</i>
<i>of his latest hit, "A Good Day to Die."</i>

37
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,360
<i>We fight for what is right</i>

38
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,136
<i>A noble sacrifice</i>

39
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,804
<i>When duty calls, you pay the price</i>

40
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:57,136
<i>For the Federation</i>
<i>I will give my life</i>

41
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,483
<i>And hey, citizen, now you can</i>
<i>celebrate Sky Marshal Anoke...</i>

42
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,020
<i>... and support our war effort</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

43
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,920
<i>Because it's always</i>
<i>a good day to buy.</i>

44
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,119
<i>- I will give my life</i>
<i>- Courage, duty, honor</i>

45
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,130
<i>For the Federation</i>
<i>I will give my life</i>

46
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,555
Incoming!

47
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,544
- Clear out!
- Run!

48
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,737
Move, move, move!

49
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,759
Can you walk, soldier?

50
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,302
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

51
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,669
Give us a hand. Pick up that arm
and find out who it belongs to.

52
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,503
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,013
Mop up, people.
We got brass up our ass in T-minus-2.

54
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,416
Surprise inspection, sir? Tonight?

55
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,285
The SM can drop in and count
the sheets any time he wants.

56
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,018
The sky marshal's coming here?

57
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,131
Ask him for an autograph, Lieutenant
Manion, and I will have you shot.

58
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,201
No, sir. Of course not, sir.

59
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,769
- Officer on deck.
- Carry on.

60
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,837
Status?

61
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,274
- Archie's testing the fence again, sir.
- Stupid Bugs.

62
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,780
Pesky, not stupid, lieutenant.

63
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,481
Keep it up, Archie.
I like my Bugs fried in the morning.

64
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,794
Boat coming down, colonel.

65
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,021
Look sharp, troopers.

66
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,572
Sir, the sky marshal is the
Federation's top-secret top secret.

67
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,215
So how'd you know
he was coming?

68
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,510
Anoke's chief of staff
used to polish my brass.

69
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,085
You know General Hauzer?

70
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,416
Dix Hauzer was a dope lieutenant
just like you once upon a time.

71
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:01,457
Made general in two years.
Some dope.

72
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,459
Only took me eight years
to make colonel.

73
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,737
Officer on deck.

74
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,012
- John Rico.
- Good to see you, Dix.

75
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,277
- How's it going?
- Good.

76
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,385
I have to introduce you to someone.
I think I'm in love.

77
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,952
Yeah? Who'd have you?

78
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,781
Here he comes, everybody.
Let's go, come on.

79
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,451
Officer on deck.

80
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,461
Sorry to drop in unannounced,
colonel.

81
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,202
And yet I sense you expect my visit.

82
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:55,445
Get in tight on this, sergeant.
Johnny Rico, our hero of Planet P.

83
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,706
I just did my part, sir.

84
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,511
Oh, no.
Heroes inspire courage, sacrifice.

85
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,210
- Sacrifice?
- Yes.

86
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,620
By asking us
to be better than what we are.

87
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,463
Tell me about Roku San, colonel.

88
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,258
Will these farmers fight?

89
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,527
They need us,
but they don't like us, sir.

90
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,501
Hearts are more fickle than minds.

91
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,670
Johnny Rico.

92
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,438
Lola Beck?

93
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,409
What are you doing here?

94
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,675
I fly the SM.

95
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,153
He gets the best.

96
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,152
Well, you know me, Johnny.

97
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,484
Yes, I know you.

98
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,259
Captain Beck is the person
I was talking about earlier.

99
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,460
You?

100
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,625
And Lola?

101
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:56,932
What's the joke?

102
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,776
Captain Beck,
you should have informed me...

103
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,107
...of your relationship
with Colonel Rico.

104
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,013
You know what I do out of uniform
is off the clock, general.

105
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,115
You three obviously
have much to discuss.

106
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,951
Buy them both
a drink on me, colonel.

107
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,353
Yes, sir.

108
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,688
- Lieutenant Manion, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

109
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,730
- Care to give me the post tour?
- Me?

110
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,663
I have all your songs, sir.

111
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,503
- Carry on, lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

112
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,335
Follow me, sir.

113
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,534
Come on, kids. We got orders.

114
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,748
You boys are the biggest girls
I've ever known.

115
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,524
What do you think of them?

116
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,098
Bugs? I hate them, sir.

117
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,394
Well, no one likes
what they can't understand.

118
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,599
But just look at the imagination.

119
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,169
The sheer virtuosity
of their creation.

120
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,245
I hate to bother you, sir, but
could you please sign my helmet?

121
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,415
Of course, trooper.

122
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,787
- Thank you, sir.
- Anytime, son.

123
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,216
All I know is...

124
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,950
...there sure are a lot more of them
at the wire today, sir.

125
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,354
A lot more.

126
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,697
Well, maybe they heard
I was going to sing.

127
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,138
- Officer on deck.
- Look sharp.

128
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,272
At ease.

129
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:50,978
Gentlemen.

130
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:58,292
You got me confused
with someone who isn't a farmer.

131
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,928
- How do I get me a hat like that?
- Join up, do your part.

132
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,939
Farmers.

133
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,076
- I'd like to ask you something.
- Sorry, chief.

134
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,079
Already married.

135
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,814
Buy them a drink on me, will you?
And bring us a bottle.

136
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,350
Hose your cage, Harlan.

137
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,519
These are the kind of people
who will lose this war for us.

138
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,594
Why is it no one in the outer colonies
wants to fight?

139
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,290
Roku San used to be a nice place.

140
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,195
Now it's war, and they blame us.

141
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,833
Archie's cooking tonight.

142
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,529
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

143
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,572
- What are they thinking?
- Archie don't think.

144
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,838
It's a good day to fry.

145
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,249
- Ten-hut.
- At ease, troopers.

146
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,150
Fascinating.

147
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,258
They seem so excited tonight.

148
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,223
You ought to hear them, sir.
They're howling out there.

149
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,488
Well, put them on the line, soldier.

150
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,305
What does it mean, sir?

151
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,205
It means we're being tested,
lieutenant.

152
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:23,081
Our loyalty, our intelligence...

153
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,273
...our imagination.

154
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,618
Excuse me, sir.
My brother really loves you.

155
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,518
- Of course. What's his name?
- Kevin.

156
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,886
- I'm sure he'll make a fine recruit.
- Thank you.

157
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,994
- May I, sir?
- Of course you can, trooper.

158
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,825
<i>Ask him for an autograph, Lieutenant</i>
<i>Manion, and I will have you shot.</i>

159
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,860
Hey, where'd he go?

160
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,709
To us.

161
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,314
To us.

162
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,756
To John, hero of Planet P.

163
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,786
Lola, two ships
shot out from under you.

164
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,460
I fly a goddamn desk.

165
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,027
The battles I fight are with numbers.
That's what I do.

166
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,364
That's what I know.

167
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,063
And that's why I know...

168
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:26,142
...that if everyone in here
doesn't step up, we're sunk.

169
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,947
- To the Federation.
- The Federation.

170
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,748
"To the Federation."

171
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,394
So, Dix.

172
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,122
Rico and I met...

173
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,825
...when Johnny was a big war hero
and I was still a six.

174
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,766
Bond tour. Ten planets, eight days.

175
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,669
Do you remember Turtle Bay?

176
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,514
So, Dix, how do you know Johnny?

177
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,311
Well, he used to be my boss
at TCOM.

178
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,788
Standard rotation.
Worst year of my life.

179
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,480
Dix saved my ass every day.

180
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,318
Hey, it's hanging time.

181
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:26,364
<i>Appeals are exhausted.</i>
<i>Their families have said goodbye.</i>

182
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:31,009
<i>All that remains is payment</i>
<i>for their crimes against you, citizen.</i>

183
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,112
<i>The senior executive executioner</i>
<i>is taking his time.</i>

184
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,175
<i>Sending a message, perhaps.</i>

185
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,120
<i>One for all of us to contemplate</i>
<i>this evening.</i>

186
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,486
<i>That our ideas,</i>
<i>no matter how pleasing...</i>

187
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,285
<i>... are dangerous.</i>

188
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,521
<i>That there are actions</i>
<i>and consequences.</i>

189
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,995
<i>That no one really counts</i>
<i>very much...</i>

190
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,193
<i>... unless we are part</i>
<i>of something bigger.</i>

191
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,264
<i>There it is, justice.</i>

192
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,164
You'll pay.
As God is my witness, you'll pay.

193
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,201
- Back off.
- Hold on, hold on, wait, wait.

194
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,963
Hey, fuck off, feddy.

195
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,836
You guys fail to understand
a very clear lesson here.

196
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,408
You got something to learn me?

197
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,638
- Come on, Dix, let's get out of here.
- Colonel Rico, if you please.

198
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,042
Yes, sir.

199
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,378
MPs, now. I want them arrested.
Everyone. That's an order.

200
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,551
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

201
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,055
You heard the general.

202
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,886
My friends,
you're not bigger than the Federation.

203
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,528
Watch what you say
and do what you're told.

204
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,358
- Or you'll have us hung, is that it?
- It's up to you.

205
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,529
Come on, Dix.
Let's get Lola out of here.

206
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,971
I don't work for you anymore, John.
Stand down.

207
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:17,441
Did you hear that, everybody?
Stand down. That's an order.

208
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,414
From now on, I take my own lumps.

209
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,915
I got this.

210
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,591
Now you're in violation of Article 5.

211
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,498
Article 8.

212
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,232
- Had enough?
- Stand down, Rico.

213
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,108
Stand down.

214
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,285
That's Article 11.

215
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,348
That's 11.

216
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,251
Which makes you subject to...

217
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,457
- Special Order 86.
- Look out!

218
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,564
Colonel Rico, you're out of order.

219
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,331
Begging the general's pardon, sir.

220
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,711
I was trying to keep an old friend
from making an ass of himself.

221
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,109
Friendship means nothing
next to duty, colonel.

222
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,646
And you have forgotten yours.

223
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,815
I thought we were here
to kill Bugs, sir.

224
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,480
Not farmers.

225
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,954
Arrest the farmers. Sedition.

226
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,792
- And Colonel Rico too.
- All right, on your feet, asshole.

227
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,195
- Failure to obey a superior officer.
- Hey, Dix, stop it.

228
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,028
Johnny's right.

229
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,225
Move it!

230
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,132
Captain Beck.

231
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,563
Return to your boat.

232
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,305
Sergeant, you have your orders.

233
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,070
Colonel, please come with me.

234
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,213
<i>Electrical system malfunction.</i>

235
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,679
Oh, no.

236
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,032
Here they come,
they're on the wall.

237
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,676
- Rico.
<i>- It's all down. Everything.</i>

238
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,541
<i>The fence is down, sir.</i>

239
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,740
- The fence?
- How could that have happened?

240
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,447
<i>Fuck, here they come.</i>

241
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,517
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

242
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,386
<i>We need reinforcements.</i>

243
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,193
<i>We need reinforcements now, sir!</i>

244
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,490
- I'm on my way.
- Hold on. You are under arrest.

245
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,135
- Is that your final word?
- No, that's an order.

246
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,631
I'll see you at my court-martial.

247
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,244
- Nice seeing you, Lola.
- Yeah.

248
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,883
Make a hole, coming through.

249
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,483
Heads up, colonel.

250
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,818
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

251
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,497
Come on, you apes.
You wanna live forever?

252
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,725
Move it. Come on.

253
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,926
Keep it moving.

254
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,504
Fall back.

255
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,830
Defensive positions. Incoming.

256
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,161
Let's go.

257
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,871
Go. Go.

258
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,843
Out of ammo, man. Out of ammo.

259
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,619
No!

260
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:36,532
- Bugs!
- Two lines! Front and back!

261
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,365
Fire!

262
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,818
Grenades!

263
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,284
Fire!

264
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,158
Forward!

265
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,642
Colonel Rico, sir.

266
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,080
- Situation, lieutenant.
- Totally ominously fucked up, sir.

267
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,017
And I lost the sky marshal too, sir.

268
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,225
Good. We'll all hang together.

269
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,996
You know what to do.
Get in there and kill them all!

270
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,341
- Where's forward command?
- It's Bugs.

271
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,449
It's Bugs.
Bugs everywhere you go, sir.

272
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,719
Sir, what are you doing here?

273
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,119
Are you wounded? We have
to get you to the lander right now.

274
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,060
I'm fine.

275
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:19,665
Marines, gather around. We must get
the sky marshal to safety right now.

276
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:23,238
Yes, sir. Formation.
This way, general.

277
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,673
Archie.

278
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,847
Clear.

279
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,327
Keep moving.

280
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,176
Archie. Get that paddock open.

281
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,108
This is General Hauzer.
Open this door.

282
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:06,773
Open the door.

283
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,016
Sir.

284
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,696
Get this door closed!

285
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,224
Dr. Wiggs, over here.
Dr. Wiggs, we need you.

286
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,834
Get him inside.

287
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,473
- Corpsman, see to Sergeant Rye.
- Yes, sir.

288
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,702
Fucking Bugs. I hate them!

289
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,882
Dr. Wiggs. Front and center.

290
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,881
- What's wrong with him?
- Careful.

291
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,620
He's in shock. Are you all right, sir?

292
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,030
Are you all right, sir?

293
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,399
Sir?

294
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,736
- I will be.
- Oh, good.

295
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,135
Here we go. Careful.

296
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,276
Captain Beck, when do we leave?

297
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,072
How about T-minus-now, sir?

298
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,813
Sir, requesting permission
to remain on Roku San, sir.

299
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,250
- Trying to be a hero, Dix?
- Somebody's gotta stay and fight.

300
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,980
Sir.

301
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,156
Colonel Rico is in command.

302
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,555
I was forced to relieve Colonel Rico.

303
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,993
He's under arrest
for acts of insubordination.

304
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,430
Serious charges.
I'm sorry for your friend.

305
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,967
Perhaps your destiny
does lay here after all, Dix.

306
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,530
Go find it.

307
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,099
And good luck, soldier.

308
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,446
Wait.

309
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,976
Just think about this for a second.

310
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,711
Because you're making a decision
for the both of us right now.

311
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,513
I know.

312
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,194
Dix, I love you.

313
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,887
I love you.

314
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,236
Blast off, Fleet.

315
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,918
<i>Attention, all units.</i>

316
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:26,556
This is General Hauzer.

317
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,726
<i>I am assuming command</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

318
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:29,916
Go to the bunker!

319
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:34,030
<i>Repeat, I'm assuming command.</i>
<i>All unit commanders report.</i>

320
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,723
<i>I want location and status. Now.</i>

321
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,232
We lost G Trench, sir.

322
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,771
Put that in a memo to
General Hauzer, will you, lieutenant?

323
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,168
Yes, sir.

324
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:48,670
This is Hauzer to all units.
I say again, I'm assuming command.

325
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,123
They're pulling back, sir.

326
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:07,029
- Get down!
- Hit the deck!

327
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:16,935
Clear the deck.

328
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,667
Skinner, Hightower, cover that hole.

329
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,869
Prepare for attack!

330
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,880
Bombardier!

331
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,107
Scorp! It's a scorp!

332
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,003
Scorpion.

333
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,610
Scorpion! Oh, fuck! Scorpion!

334
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,911
Fire, fire, fire!

335
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,663
Grenades!

336
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,426
Take us home, Captain Beck.

337
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,498
Warp in five, number one.

338
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,734
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>
<i>What about General Hauzer, ma'am?</i>

339
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,913
He wants combat.
Take us out on my mark.

340
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:06,675
Five, four, three, two, one.

341
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,586
The guy says, "Man,
then we can all get some sleep."

342
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,197
Fucking Archie.
Can't believe I got bitten.

343
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,162
Yeah, he got you.

344
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,199
Officer on deck.

345
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,202
At ease.

346
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,873
Nice work out there, sergeant.

347
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,045
Thank you, ma'am. SM all okay?

348
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,644
Thanks to you boys.

349
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,750
What do we say, marines?

350
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,285
- Yeah.
- Carry on.

351
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,054
Oh, boy.

352
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,696
Chief Brittles, are we shipshape?

353
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,527
You'd be the first to know, captain.

354
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,028
Just saying hi, Bull.

355
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:09,702
Excuse me, ma'am.

356
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,747
If that's the SM's dinner,
after you, Holly.

357
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,578
Thank you, ma'am.

358
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,083
What's cooking, Jingo?

359
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,847
You know,
the same old shit on a shingle.

360
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,968
- Drink, captain?
- On duty, doc.

361
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,696
Me too.

362
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:42,671
Captain Beck.
Give a listen, will you?

363
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:47,584
Today we have suffered grave defeat
at Roku San.

364
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:53,652
But I am confident that there exists
balance in the cosmos and...

365
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,120
Excuse me, sir.

366
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:03,527
I am certain that there exists balance
in the cosmos.

367
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:07,933
And where there is defeat,
we will make victory.

368
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:10,868
What do you think?

369
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,509
I have to address
the council tomorrow.

370
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:16,202
Well, sir, everybody loves victory.

371
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,942
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be getting back to the cockpit.

372
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,953
Look, look, can't they manage
without you just for once?

373
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,182
Let's stay and talk.

374
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,993
Certainly, sir, I'd be happy to.

375
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,733
Hold on.

376
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,071
We're falling out of warp.

377
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,983
Sir, for your own protection...

378
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,745
...l'm gonna need to get you
to the marine lander.

379
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,653
Holly, stay with us.

380
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,925
- What just hit us?
- I think we just hit each other.

381
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,626
Come on, Holly, let's move.

382
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,732
- Marines, report to the rescue deck.
- I read you, Captain Beck.

383
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,496
And we are on our way.

384
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,508
Let's go.

385
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,750
Come on.

386
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,087
Marines. Right here, brothers.

387
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,578
Let's go.

388
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,599
Was that a reactor, chief?

389
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,395
Secondary. Number one
will turn us into daylight.

390
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,599
I'm okay. I'm okay.

391
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,002
- Abandon ship, chief.
- Yes, ma'am.

392
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,905
Sergeant Rye,
the SM goes with you.

393
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,239
Yes, ma'am. Come with us now, sir.

394
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,915
Captain Beck, I would prefer
that you stay at my side.

395
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,745
Yes, sir. Crew chief,
get everyone else to the rescue pod.

396
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,420
You got it.

397
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,483
- We got a little problem in the galley.
- Jingo, jeez.

398
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,455
Dumb ass.

399
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:12,888
- You okay?
- Yeah.

400
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,122
Go get the SM, Chick.

401
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,391
Sir, this way.

402
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,772
No! Damn it!

403
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:33,309
- Marines, get to your lander.
- I will see you on the ground.

404
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,180
Okay, people, let's move.
To the rescue pod, now.

405
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,015
- Are we crashing?
- No, we're getting into the rescue pod.

406
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,885
<i>The Roku San line,</i>
<i>key to the Federation's defense...</i>

407
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,252
<i>... knows defeat in one night.</i>

408
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,157
<i>How many dead? No man can say.</i>

409
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,854
<i>Experts agree on one thing only:</i>

410
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,556
<i>Blame falls squarely</i>
<i>on Colonel John Rico.</i>

411
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,164
<i>Once heralded</i>
<i>as the hero of Planet P.</i>

412
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,306
<i>Now disgraced</i>
<i>and awaiting court-martial...</i>

413
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,409
<i>... from his cell at the Alamo Bay</i>
<i>Federal Detention Facility.</i>

414
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,546
<i>Another day, another peace rally</i>
<i>in the outer colonies.</i>

415
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,013
<i>The Federation</i>
<i>has taken advantage.</i>

416
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,483
<i>But this time it's different,</i>
<i>because of Elmo Goniff.</i>

417
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,814
Hey, I'm a citizen.

418
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,923
<i>Decorated veteran turned pacifist...</i>

419
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,787
<i>... and now the leader</i>

420
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:52,224
<i>... who question the Federation's</i>

421
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,692
<i>... of the Arachnid conflict.</i>

422
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:57,857
- and counting. Why?
I found my answers in faith.

423
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,333
<i>And I have faith in God, not people.</i>

424
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,372
<i>Peace at any price is a human right.</i>

425
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,406
<i>And there are other costs too.</i>

426
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,273
<i>Defeat at Roku San</i>
<i>has fueled the anti-war movement...</i>

427
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,449
<i>... resulting in the deaths</i>
<i>of 144 outer-colony students...</i>

428

432
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,964
<i>My fellow citizens, I come</i>
<i>to you today with a heavy heart.</i>

433
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,864
<i>Within the past 12 hours...</i>

434
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,204
<i>... we have suffered</i>
<i>ignominious defeat at Roku San.</i>

435
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,005
<i>Incompetence at the highest levels</i>
<i>of command...</i>

436
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:46,877
...and betrayal...

437
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,249
...by those who would protest,
question...

438
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:54,755
...and commit acts
of civil disobedience.

439
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:59,992
I assure you that those responsible
for the catastrophe at Roku San...

440
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:04,532
...and all crimes against
the Federation, large and small...

441
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,329
...will be punished.

442
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:13,810
Ours is a war of human destiny...

443
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:18,578
...that will end only in total victory.

444
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,220
And we're out.

445
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:30,127
Okay, let's wrap it up. Good.

446
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,519
So?

447
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,361
What's the matter, general?
You don't look very happy with me.

448
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,869
We all understand
the need to maintain stability...

449
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,666
...until we locate the sky marshal.

450
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,002
I'm surprised to see you.

451
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,373
I thought you'd take some time
to recover from your ordeal.

452
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,277
The sky marshal would want me
in the office, admiral.

453
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,508
Naturally.

454
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,134
Excuse me, sir.

455
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,563
Sorry, sir.

456
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,477
- Lieutenant?
- Lamb.

457
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,581
I know no one's supposed
to talk about it...

458
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,752
...but I'm sorry
about the sky marshal, sir.

459
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:05,889
That's classified, lieutenant.
Phid will have your head in a noose.

460
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,952
But thanks.

461
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,756
Something else?

462
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,097
A distress call
came out of the AQZ yesterday.

463
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,468
And how are you aware of this
and I'm not?

464
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:30,272
The transmission came through
on my watch, sir.

465
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,113
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.</i>
<i>Come in, Fleet.</i>

466
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,686
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform,</i>
<i>this is Fleet Rescue, over.</i>

467
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:42,222
<i>Requesting priority pickup</i>
<i>for sky marshal plus five.</i>

468
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,028
What happened
when you kicked it upstairs?

469
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:52,635
We were instructed to ignore it, sir,
and all future transmissions.

470
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,601
And I'm supposed to
keep my mouth shut.

471
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,499
That why you're here, lieutenant?

472
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,606
They're out there all alone
and no one's doing anything about it.

473
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:04,639
Sir.

474
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,214
You were never here, lieutenant.

475
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,689
No, sir. Never.

476
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,541
<i>Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.</i>
<i>Come in, Fleet.</i>

477
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,642
Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.

478
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,181
Fleet Rescue, come in.

479
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,645
They're gonna come and get us,
right, captain?

480
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,720
I mean, like,
how long till they get here?

481
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,016
Here you go, doc.

482
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:52,059
I say again,
Sierra Mike Uniform to Fleet Rescue.

483
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,026
Come in, Fleet.

484
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,727
Is anyone out there?

485
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,731
I don't think we're getting through.
Jingo, get out of there.

486
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,275
Why? I like it in here. Okay.

487
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,408
The solar cells need recharging.

488
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,053
Don't have time
for a day at the beach.

489
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,059
Bugs!

490
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:32,728
One or 1000?

491
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,871
Who's to say
there's not an army out there?

492
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,302
- Oh, God.
- I didn't see anything.

493
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,497
Probably a scout.

494
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,734
We need to get off this beach
pronto, people.

495
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:41,934
Leave the rescue pod?

496
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,774
You want your back to the water
when these Bugs show up?

497
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,415
Be my guest, doc.

498
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,748
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

499
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,718
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done...

500
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:53,912
Give it a break.

501
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,351
Easy now, captain.

502
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,531
You ain't sure,
and you're scaring us all to death.

503
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,199
On Earth as it is in heaven.

504
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,427
Give us this day our daily bread
and del...

505
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,369
You are really getting on my nerves.

506
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,039
You've got no cause to do that.

507
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,716
Get your hand off me, crew chief.

508
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,979
You're hurting him.

509
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,754
Everyone's got a right
to think what they want.

510
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,591
Sure, as long as they keep it
to themselves.

511
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,769
Saddle up. We're moving out.

512
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,172
Wait a second. When Fleet Rescue
comes looking for us...

513
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,773
...this is the first place
they're gonna come, right?

514
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,806
I expect they would, Bull.

515
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,444
Then we should stay right here.

516
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,638
And if the Bugs do attack,
we just fall right back to the pod.

517
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,238
Smart thinking, Bull.

518
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,312
You ever been in a swarm,
big man?

519
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,921
Swarm? Oh, my God, no.

520
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,449
They'll tear this pod apart
like a paper bag.

521
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,690
Oh, God, save us.

522
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:08,262
Now, gear up, we're moving out.
And that's an order.

523
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,001
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

524
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,696
- Can the God talk.
- You're wrong, Captain Beck.

525
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:20,308
God is everywhere, surrounding us.

526
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,500
Excuse me, sir?

527
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,510
All of us search for God
in our own way...

528
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,012
...whether we know it or not.

529
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,450
Do you really believe that, sir?

530
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,713
Yes, Holly, I do.

531
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:37,383
I had no idea
that you were one of us.

532
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,596
All right. Well, all of you guys
can go look for God.

533
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,663
I'm heading
for the Fleet marine lander.

534
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,758
They've got weapons,
maybe even a com that works.

535
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,835
And it's only
about a hundred klicks away.

536
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,131
Only a hundred klicks away.

537
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,673
We ain't got rations for that.

538
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,677
You're fat. You won't need any.
Let's move, people.

539
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,795
<i>Colonel John Rico,</i>
<i>for incompetence of command...</i>

540
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,601
<i>... assault on a superior officer,</i>
<i>and willful negligence...</i>

541
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:28,574
<i>... resulting in the deaths of several</i>
<i>soldiers under your command...</i>

542
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:32,374
<i>... you are sentenced to hang</i>
<i>by the neck until you are dead.</i>

543
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,489
Do you have anything to say
before the sentence is carried out?

544
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,249
Get on with it, will you?

545
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,655
I'll see you in hell.

546
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,759
What the hell is this?

547
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,598
Your lucky day.

548
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,333
Intelligence. Classified.

549
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,603
You talk, and next time
it's your neck in the noose.

550
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:38,773
Let's go, hero.

551
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,746
You gonna hang me yourself, Dix?

552
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,015
Maybe I got some better things
for you to do.

553
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,625
You come here a lot,
don't you, Dix?

554
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,319
Didn't know you were interested
in political prisoners.

555
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,725
Not me.
I come with the sky marshal.

556
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,766
- Interrogations.
- Anoke likes the personal touch, eh?

557
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,802
Not like you think.
Not human prisoners.

558
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,941
That first Brain, the one
you captured on P, we keep it here.

559
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,776
- It's still alive?
- Alive and a lot bigger.

560
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,106
No one really knows
how long they live.

561
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,374
What's it good for?

562
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,348
Anoke was fascinated by that thing.

563
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,649
Why's my neck suddenly worth more
than a piece of rope?

564
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,655
It's about the future
of the Federation, Johnny.

565
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,624
- And Lola.
- What's that got to do with me?

566
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,196
- You're the only one I can trust.
- Why's that, buddy?

567
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,368
Because everyone thinks
you're dead.

568
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,439
- Captain?
- I see them, Jingo.

569
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,113
I count 16.

570
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,582
Bugs? Where?

571
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,285
- Oh, no.
- Why did they stop?

572
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,719
Let's move.

573
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:39,926
- Bull.
- What?

574
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,833
- You with me.
- You got it.

575
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,273
They're herding us.

576
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,814
Why? They could have us easy.

577
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,315
Perhaps we find ourselves
under the grace of a higher power.

578
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,383
You really think so, sir?

579
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,356
I know it in my heart, Holly.

580
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:20,735
Do you really think we're protected
by some higher power?

581
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,673
Singing can't hurt.

582
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:27,809
Lifts the spirit and helps
pass the time, don't you think?

583
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,354
I think we're not dead
and we should be.

584
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,486
Yeah.

585
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,084
<i>It's big. It's deadly.</i>

586
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,558
<i>And everyone's got an opinion</i>
<i>about the new Q-bomb.</i>

587
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,862
<i>Politicians and citizens alike</i>
<i>worry about the morality of a bomb...</i>

588
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,199
<i>... rumored to be so powerful</i>
<i>it can crack a planet.</i>

589
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,933
<i>Creation of a weapon</i>
<i>that can destroy the very planet...</i>

590
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:31,308
<i>... on which I now stand is nothing</i>
<i>if not a dangerous precedent...</i>

591
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,540
<i>... for the entire human race.</i>

592
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,012
<i>What people fail to grasp...</i>

593
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,449
<i>... is how many planets</i>
<i>there are in the universe.</i>

594
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,714
<i>And that the universe itself</i>
<i>often destroys other planets.</i>

595
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:44,325
<i>The Federation can't decide which</i>
<i>planet lives and which planet dies.</i>

596
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:49,397
<i>The Lord giveth</i>
<i>and the Lord taketh away.</i>

597
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,558
<i>You think those dirty Bugs wouldn't</i>
<i>use a Q-bomb if they had one?</i>

598
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,136
<i>But aren't we supposed to be</i>
<i>better than the Bugs?</i>

599
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,741
<i>You said it, Mom.</i>
<i>That's controversy with a Q.</i>

600
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,246
Yesterday I dropped troopers
into a combat zone.

601
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,478
Today I'm flying
to the outer colonies.

602
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:12,780
I'm Fleet.

603
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,515
- I'm Fleet too.
- We're Fleet too.

604
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,154
Me? Really?

605
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,855
<i>If you have strong math skills,</i>
<i>high reflex index...</i>

606
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,557
<i>... and an HED of 8. 1 or better,</i>
<i>we need you now.</i>

607
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:26,895
<i>Sixteen? No problem.</i>

608
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,402
<i>Start training today</i>
<i>for your future, citizen.</i>

609
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:32,166
People say boys don't give good HED.
But I do.

610
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,004
<i>When you go Fleet,</i>
<i>there's no telling where you'll end up.</i>

611
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,509
You know, when I was young...

612
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:40,240
...I dreamed
that one day I'd fly a starship...

613
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,611
...or even visit Sanctuary.

614
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:45,253
Fleet has taken me to the top.

615
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,686
How high you fly is up to you
when you go Fleet.

616
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:52,259
So why not do your part
and sign up today?

617
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,396
See you in the cockpit.

618
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,498
<i>Would you like to know more?</i>

619
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,943
Well, John.

620
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,352
Your first time at Sanctuary.

621
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,693
- So this is the big wow.
- This is it.

622
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,527
If the Bugs find this place,
they'll knock out the Fleet.

623
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:33,999
No Fleet, you lose the outer colonies.
Mobile Infantry couldn't hold them.

624
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,695
There goes the neighborhood.

625
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,807
- Next stop, Earth.
- Yeah.

626
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:42,103
Guess that makes Sanctuary
the biggest secret of the war.

627
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,576
Not even the sky marshal
knows where it is.

628
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:49,947
Only a handful of active-duty pilots
are entrusted with that information.

629
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,677
Don't tell me.

630
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,313
Lola's one of them.

631
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:59,328
Yup, and if we don't find her,
we're sunk.

632
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,202
I'm sending you
to the Arachnid Quarantine Zone...

633
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,171
...as soon as you saddle up.

634
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,306
What do we know about this planet?

635
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,843
OM-1? Nothing.

636
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,742
We don't even have
its exact position.

637
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:21,179
What about the rescue call?
Wasn't there a beacon?

638
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,717
Enolo Phid
doesn't want Anoke rescued.

639
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,856
- I don't get it.
- Phid wants to be Anoke.

640
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,618
I'm glad all I do is fight Bugs.

641
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,920
So I'm gonna get the coordinates
and you go in.

642
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,461
Roger that.

643
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,757
But what makes you so sure
they're still alive?

644
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,401
Well, Lola's hard to kill.

645
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,730
If this mission is off the books...

646
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,533
...how are you gonna get me
a regiment to invade the AQZ?

647
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:49,143
A regiment? Not even close.

648
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,704
- So how many troopers do I get?
- Seven.

649
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,713
- What?
- That's including you.

650
00:50:56,453 --> 00:51:00,514
You're sending me into
the Bug house with a rifle squad?

651
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:04,320
Why didn't you just
let them hang me, Dix?

652
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,929
Maybe I should have.

653
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,058
Don't worry,
I'm assembling your team now.

654
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:17,029
It's my funeral. My pick of the team.

655
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,470
Any way you want it.

656
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:34,285
They aren't much to look at,
are they?

657
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:38,261
Well, we didn't build them
to do pretty things.

658
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,440
Hey, doc.

659
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:56,606
- When did he get the religion?
- I wouldn't call it religion per se.

660
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,873
- He's spiritual.
- That's different.

661
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:03,211
Yeah, two months ago, I received
a call in the middle of the night.

662
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,411
I hadn't seen him for a week.

663
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:09,114
He told me he'd been in the desert
and that he'd been tested.

664
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,351
He wasn't himself.

665
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:12,951
Go on.

666
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,563
Well, every man, even great men...

667
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:19,360
...experience moments of doubt
when they're tired and afraid.

668
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,036
Afraid of what?

669
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:24,207
He told me that this was a war
that would never end.
