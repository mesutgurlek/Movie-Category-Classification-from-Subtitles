1
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,519
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

2
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,395
Mr. Tideman.

3
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,358
Mr. Lasky?
AW3 Marty Padanski.

4
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,364
Mr. Lasky? I'm Richard Tideman's
executive assistant.

5
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,767
- Glad to know ya. Are you going with me?
- No.

6
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,169
Mr. Tideman just wanted
to see you off.

7
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,739
- Is that him in the car?
- Yes.

8
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,979
Well, we've never met.
Can I introduce myself?

9
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,241
It isn't necessary,
Mr. Lasky.

10
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,719
As I said,
he came to see you off.

11
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,882
Well, thank him for me.

12
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,535
Take a look, sir.

13
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,843
<i>Arizona</i> Memorial.

14
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,000
<i>She's now resting in 33 feet of water</i>
<i>in an upright position.</i>

15
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,766
<i>There were only 289 survivors.</i>

16
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,745
Russian trawler.

17
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,614
What's it doing?

18
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,057
Not doing
much fishing!

19
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,483
I'll take it, sir.

20
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,488
Mr. Lasky, I'm Commander
Dan Thurman, executive officer.

21
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,989
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

22
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,356
Now follow me
to the Bridge.

23
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,022
<i>Stand clear, spot 3.</i>

24
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,657
<i>Helo-733, rotating.</i>

25
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,635
- Give me 25 knots of wind over the deck.
- Aye, Captain.

26
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,606
- All ahead full.
- All ahead full, aye.

27
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,803
- Indicate 100 R.P.M.
- Indicate 100 R.P.M. Aye, sir.

28
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,338
Central Bridge,
all ahead full, 100 R.P.M.

29
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,315
- Continue fixed wing recovery.
- Aye, Captain.

30
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,553
Let's bring the Kag aboard.

31
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,579
Victor-200,
your signal is Charlie.

32
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,724
- Set 52, Tomcat.
- Set 52, Tomcat.

33
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,954
<i>T- minus 30 seconds.</i>

34
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:55,101
<i>Tomcat 200.</i>
<i>I'm on approach and lining up.</i>

35
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,267
<i>Gear coming down.</i>

36
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,284
<i>200, slightly right.</i>

37
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:10,983
<i>Gear down and locked.</i>

38
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,615
<i>Add power. Power.</i>

39
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,886
<i>All indicators green.</i>

40
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,622
<i>Hold there.</i>

41
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,191
<i>Hold it. Slightly left.</i>

42
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,333
<i>In the groove. Looks good.</i>

43
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:17,481
<i>In the port, Cat 1. Get below.</i>
<i>We still have aircraft to land.</i>

44
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,648
I hear you're on assignment
from Tideman Industries

45
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,021
to the Defense Department, right?

46
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,118
- Yeah, that's right.
- What is your job, Mr. Lasky?

47
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,892
- I'm a systems analyst.
- Oh, efficiency expert, right?

48
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,159
Yeah, you could say that.

49
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,305
- That's a quick change in the weather.
- Yeah!

50
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,776
Sure is.

51
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,583
- Hi, Kag.
- It's getting a little strange out there, boys.

52
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,924
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Lasky.
- Thank you, Captain.

53
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,760
- Are we headed for a squall?
- Not an official one.

54
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,197
Sir, this is Commander Damon,
operations officer.

55
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,204
- How do you do, Mr. Lasky?
- Fine, thank you.

56
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,069
And Lieutenant Perry,
officer of the deck.

57
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,667
- How do you do, sir?
- Good, sir.

58
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,875
Mr. Lasky is going to be
taking a look

59
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,968
at how we do things
here aboard the <i>Nimitz.</i>

60
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,408
- We'll give you whatever help we can, sir.
- Thank you.

61
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,614
Our departure
was delayed two days

62
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,187
- at the request of your mysterious boss.
- I'm sorry about that, Captain

63
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,781
but I'm afraid Mr. Richard Tideman
is as much a mystery to me

64
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,493
- as he is to the rest of the world.
- Two days.

65
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,893
Perhaps the fact that Tideman
helped design and build this ship

66
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,662
affords him some
special privileges.

67
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,564
Corporal Kullman will escort you
while you're aboard ship.

68
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,762
- Right this way, sir.
- Oh, Mr. Lasky?

69
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,237
I'd be delighted if
you'd join me for dinner.

70
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,332
Thank you, Captain.
I'd like that.

71
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,725
Am I mistaken, or was Black Cloud's
forecast this morning

72
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:13,464
- for clear skies and sunshine?
- I'll bet he wishes it wasn't, sir.

73
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,005
Hand me that weather report,
please.

74
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,475
Thank you.

75
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,457
What do you think it is?

76
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,397
It wasn't there
on the morning run.

77
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,696
Check all projection lenses,
and if it's not there, check all receivers.

78
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,796
Aye, aye, sir.

79
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,422
The <i>Nimitz.</i> Who's that?

80
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,258
- A Russian trawler.
- What's he want?

81
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,560
A big fish!

82
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,263
You've been assigned
Navigator's inport cabin, sir.

83
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,465
Connects with Commander Owens,
our air wing commander.

84
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,338
Your luggage has
been delivered, sir.

85
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,140
I'll be just outside, sir,
if there's anything you need.

86
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,612
Thank you.

87
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,912
Hello?

88
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,670
<i>"Pacific At War,</i>
Commander Richard T. Owens."

89
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,124
Very well.

90
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,789
We're having communication problems
with the incoming flights.

91
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,094
- What do you mean?
- It's interference from the storm, sir.

92
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,227
- Get Black Cloud up here.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,605
Sunshine and clear skies.

94
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,147
- Anything else you'd like to see?
- I beg your pardon.

95
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,414
What the hell are you
doing in my cabin?

96
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,511
I'm terribly sorry.

97
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,750
You're Commander Owens.
I'm Warren Lasky.

98
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,190
They put me next door.

99
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,321
Mr. Lasky, the one thing
we cherish aboard a ship is privacy.

100
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,525
Maybe it's because we get
so damn little of it.

101
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,364
I understand.
I hope you'll forgive me.

102
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,933
You know, from what I've read,
your manuscript is very good;

103
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,132
I mean, really very good.

104
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,041
Thank you.
You a historian, Mr. Lasky?

105
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,909
I'm a little bit of everything, I guess.
I work for Tideman Industries.

106
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,244
What exactly is your job
aboard this ship?

107
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,787
Very simply, I look at the way
you people do things

108
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,254
and if I can think
of any alternatives

109
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:55,592
I write it up and submit a report
to the Department of Defense.

110
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,163
Think you'll find some?

111
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,496
Well, there are always
alternatives, Commander.

112
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,826
Mr. Lasky, please don't
look for them in here.

113
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,872
Excuse me.

114
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,115
Boss, Kag's here.

115
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,626
George, any further word
from Stanton?

116
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,993
We know he's inbound, but we can't
talk to him. His radios are garbled.

117
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,625
Just wish he had more experience.

118
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,294
Yes, Captain.
Yes, sir. He's right here.

119
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,963
- Kag?
- Yes, Skipper?

120
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,910
- How many planes have you got in the air?
- Just one, sir.

121
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,777
- Our newest pilot, Stanton.
- Well, get him aboard as fast as you can.

122
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,545
- I want to get out of this weather.
- Right away, Skipper.

123
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,049
- He wants him down now. Keep trying.
- Corsair, 412.

124
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,177
Air Ops Primary, try again on 412.
See if you can reach him.

125
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,228
Take a look
at the scope, sir.

126
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,364
The water temperature's
down five degrees

127
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,341
and even the barometer's
giving improper readings.

128
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,138
It should be down,
and it's way up.

129
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,116
- What the hell is that?
- It seems to have a cycle, sir.

130
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,449
One run it's there,
the next one is clear.

131
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:35,220
One run it's there, the next one is clear.
I've never seen anything like it.

132
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,192
Turn those destroyers around
and head them back to Pearl Harbor.

133
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,128
- No need for them to go through this.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,962
Keep it in the wind till we get
that Corsair aboard.

135
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,501
It's one of our new pilots.

136
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,800
All units in Romeo Alpha,
this is Kilo Bravo.

137
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,924
<i>This is 412. I have an unsafe</i>
<i>hook indicator. Over.</i>

138
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,526
<i>412, roger. Unsafe hook.</i>
<i>Recycle your hook.</i>

139
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,185
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>I've tried that.</i>

140
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,595
<i>412,your transmission's poor.</i>
<i>Say your fuel's state.</i>

141
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,726
Captain Boss, that Corsair's in real trouble.
Can't get his tail hook down.

142
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,929
- I think we better take him in the barricade.
- Rig it!

143
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,803
Air Ops, tri-flight.
On the flight deck!

144
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,604
<i>We have an A-7 Corsair in trouble.</i>
<i>Can't get his hook down.</i>

145
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:31,876
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

146
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,579
<i>Repeat, this is not a drill.</i>
<i>Now rig the barricade!</i>

147
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:39,952
<i>Bow deck! Bow deck!</i>
<i>This is no drill!</i>

148
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,928
<i>All right! Let's go!</i>

149
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,522
<i>Go on! Let's hustle now!</i>

150
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,936
<i>All personnel</i>
<i>off the deck now!</i>

151
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,080
<i>Barricade coming up.</i>
<i>Clear the area!</i>

152
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,244
<i>Clear the flight deck!</i>

153
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,122
- Do you see him out there yet?
- Yeah, there he is!

154
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,598
Head's up! Green deck,
land aircraft.

155
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,999
My God. Look at that.

156
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,997
Have Central come up on theJ.A.

157
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,009
- Steady as she goes.
- Steady as she goes, aye.

158
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,409
Central Bridge,
pick up theJ.A.

159
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,311
- Aye, sir.
- Where's that plane?

160
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:22,217
I don't see it,
Captain.

161
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,287
Sound general quarters.

162
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,521
- Aye, Captain. Boatswain.
- Boatswain mate. Aye, sir.

163
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,656
- Sound general quarters.
- Aye, sir.

164
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,109
<i>General quarters,</i>
<i>general quarters.</i>

165
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,270
<i>All hands,</i>
<i>man your battle stations.</i>

166
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,872
<i>Go up and forward on your starboard side,</i>
<i>down and aft on your port side.</i>

167
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,349
<i>General quarters,</i>
<i>general quarters.</i>

168
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,129
<i>Time plus two minutes.</i>

169
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:20,945
- What the hell's goin' on?
- General quarters, sir. Come with me.

170
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,105
<i>Time plus three minutes.</i>

171
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,983
Time plus four.

172
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,687
Report when all stations
are manned and ready.

173
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:41,264
Got him right there!
Comin' in! A-7 Corsair!

174
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,563
Heads up on deck!
He's in bound to the barricade.

175
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,900
<i>Green jackets</i>
<i>to the barricade.</i>

176
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,884
We can't hear you.

177
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,924
All right.

178
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,510
Crash on deck! Crash on deck!
All personnel respond now!

179
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,376
<i>Let's get out there</i>
<i>and watch for fire!</i>

180
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,319
Red shirts, front and center!
Move it, move it!

181
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,788
Move it!

182
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,724
- Go back to course 350.
- Aye, aye, sir.

183
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,305
Okay! Take 'er down!

184
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,477
<i>All personnel on the Flight Deck,</i>
<i>let's turn to.</i>

185
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:16,153
<i>Blue shirts, locks and chains</i>
<i>on the aircraft.</i>

186
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,766
Is this the last known position
of our destroyers before the storm?

187
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,533
- Yes, sir, Captain.
- Skipper.

188
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:34,111
Dan, go down and check out
the Threat Board.

189
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,376
- Keep me posted.
- Right.

190
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,246
- Get Kag up here.
- Yes, sir.

191
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,580
I want to talk
to CI NPAC Fleet.

192
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,316
Captain, we're down across the board.
Antennas check out, but we're off the air.

193
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,857
- Any word from our destroyers?
- <i>We aren't getting anything</i>

194
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,554
except some code transmissions
in the 200-meter band.

195
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,290
Otherwise, we're dead
as a doornail.

196
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,094
- Ops, what's our radar picture?
- Radar shows us clear, sir.

197
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,136
Clear? Can't you see
that Russian trawler?

198
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,671
I have the signal officer
on deck, but no visual sighting, sir.

199
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,641
Keep me advised.
Navigator, what's our posi?

200
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,577
270, Captain.
280 miles west of Pearl Harbor.

201
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:14,310
Oh, Dick. Launch a Hawkeye
to check ship's communications

202
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,048
a Crusader to make a photo run over
Pearl and put two Tomcats on ready alert.

203
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:21,317
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Captain! Captain!

204
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,690
Hey, what happened?

205
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,598
Frankly, I don't know.

206
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,931
Lieutenant, have the heads
of all departments

207
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,894
meet me at C.V.I.C.
immediately after the launch.

208
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,004
Aye, aye, sir.

209
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:37,134
- Mr. Lasky, I want you to stay with me.
- Captain's off the Bridge.

210
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,808
It's a code.

211
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,072
Can you break it,
Chief?

212
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,584
- I think someone's putting us on.
- Why?

213
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,815
Because I learned this code
at Great Lakes. It's ancient.

214
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,018
Thanks, Chief.

215
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,819
<i>Stand clear at 012.</i>
<i>Hawkeye rotating.</i>

216
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,087
<i>Off the bow, stand clear.</i>

217
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,147
<i>736 lifting for plane guard.</i>

218
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,048
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

219
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,310
- Go hold your own!
- Who said that?

220
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,853
Chrissakes, Chief, all we want to know
is what's going on.

221
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,456
- Whatever it is, you'll be told.
- When?

222
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,719
- As soon as the skipper's ready.
- That's what they always say!

223
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,093
Hey, Ex-O, what's goin' on?
Attention on deck!

224
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,327
Carry on.

225
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:23,040
Gentlemen, we're at general quarters,
because I don't have any idea what's happened.

226
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:26,651
But I don't exclude
the possibility of war.

227
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:31,350
- A nuclear strike?
- Possibility.

228
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,226
- Now, what action's been taken?
- Well, Skipper

229
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,659
there's nothing on the Threat Board

230
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,089
and there's been no
significant damage to the ship.

231
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,598
- The crew's in good shape.
- Air wing is intact. First team's ready to go.

232
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,225
E-2 is now showing the area clear,
and reconnaissance aircraft

233
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,031
should be coming up on Pearl, sir.

234
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:51,068
The reactor is stable.
All readings are normal.

235
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,836
Capable for maximum speed,
Captain.

236
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,412
- Lloyd.
- We can transmit and receive

237
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,948
- but we haven't been able to reach anybody.
- Why's that?

238
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,484
Tried everybody in the book...
CI NPAC, Joint Chiefs...

239
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,349
I even took a crack
at the White House.

240
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,421
Now, we do have some low-band
transmissions...

241
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,353
strictly manual
stuff with very low power.

242
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,119
We'll have to do some retuning
to transmit in that range.

243
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,785
Get on with it!

244
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,093
- Ops?
- All radar's up, all weapon systems check out.

245
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,105
- We're ready, sir.
- Mr. Lasky. You have anything to add?

246
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,399
- No, sir, not at this time.
- Skipper.

247
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,534
I have a reconnaissance report
coming in now, sir.

248
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:33,150
Flight level 250.
Camera rolling.

249
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:38,847
<i>There doesn't appear to be any damage.</i>
<i>Seems to be some unusual shipping traffic.</i>

250
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,117
<i>I'll make another pass</i>
<i>for a close-up series.</i>

251
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:44,320
- <i>Over.</i>
- E.T.A. to <i>Nimitz,</i> 12 minutes, sir.

252
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,921
Skipper, we're picking up some weird
traffic on the A.M. broadcast band

253
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,933
on the entertainment circuit,
but the signal strength is very weak.

254
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:55,129
<i>Boss, I told you. I tried and tried,</i>
<i>and I can't get Carmichael to go to sleep.</i>

255
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,709
<i>Rochester, that polar bear's</i>
<i>got to go to sleep.</i>

256
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,802
- <i>He's supposed to hibernate.</i>
- Jack Benny?

257
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,238
<i>Where is he now?</i>

258
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,942
<i>Sittin'up in bed,</i>
<i>readin'</i> Esquire.

259
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,745
Esquire? <i>Well,</i>
<i>take it away from him.</i>

260
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,550
<i>Oh, come now, boss.</i>
<i>He's been around.</i>

261
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,023
Lloyd, tape and monitor
all transmissions.

262
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:19,619
Ops, I want a closer look on all air,
surface and subsurface contacts

263
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,733
within 250 miles
of this ship.

264
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,169
Dick, put some tankers and a medium-sized
strike force on a 30-minute alert.

265
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,472
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Any questions?

266
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:31,533
Skipper, the ship is still at general quarters.
Request permission to go to condition 3.

267
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:36,179
Granted. I'll be on the Bridge.
I want answers.

268
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,543
Attention on deck!

269
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,992
<i>Secure from general quarters.</i>
<i>Set condition 3.</i>

270
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,323
- I stand relieved.
- Very well.

271
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:29,092
- Bridge.
- Captain's on the Bridge.

272
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:34,831
Captain, C.I.C. reports a surface contact
bearing 350° at 130 miles.

273
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,004
- I want an I.D. on the surface contact.
- Yes, sir.

274
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,238
- Launch the ready alert.
- Aye, sir.

275
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,140
<i>Which, translated</i>
<i>into world terms</i>

276
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,017
<i>means a worldwide reduction</i>
<i>of armaments</i>

277
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:29,491
<i>to such a point</i>
<i>and in such a thorough fashion</i>

278
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:33,154
<i>that no nation</i>
<i>will be in a position</i>

279
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,789
<i>to commit an act</i>
<i>of physical aggression</i>

280
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,529
<i>against any neighbor anywhere</i>

00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,901
<i>in the world.</i>

282
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,598
What the hell's the matter with him?

283
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,369
He's asking us to trust our enemies,
and he knows better.

284
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,945
You're absolutely right.

285
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,986
Hey, Laurel,
you finished that very quickly.

286
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:05,723
Well, I hope so. Let's see,
where were we? Uhh...

287
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:09,424
"And there"...Oops.
"And therefore"...Ah, here we are.

288
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,831
"So if he does choose
to support my program

289
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,200
let Senator Chapman
be assured now

290
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,774
that I am fully aware
of those qualities in him

291
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,766
which recommend him
as cabinet material."

292
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,376
I think that says it exactly.
You agree, Arthur?

293
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:27,178
- Miss Scott, you should've been a diplomat.
- I rather thought I was.

294
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,378
Well, you certainly cooked up
a compromise that's gonna make your boss

295
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,956
the next vice president
of the United States.

296
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,219
I better type this up before you two start
trying to improve on it.

297
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,795
- Thanks, Laurel.
- <i>Here in downtown Honolulu</i>

00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,860
Arthur, will you leave the girl
enough clothes on not to catch cold?

300
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,266
She's too valuable to me.

301
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,896
Have you slept with her yet?

302
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,271
What kind of a question is
that to ask a married man?

303
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,369
- You son of a gun!
- Think I better go check what she's doin'.

304
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,472
- Oh, sure!
- Arthur, have another drink

305
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,818
and stop thinking about how
much everybody else is gettin'.

306
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:04,117
- Thanks!
- See you later.

307
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,919
We swung it, Laurel. How about that?
We really swung it!

308
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,557
- Did you tell him you were sleeping with me?
- What?

309
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,362
Laurel. I wish I was.

310
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,428
- I'm not gonna lie about it.
- People assume you are anyway.

311
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:25,405
- I'll just have to live with the fact.
- Fact?

312
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,976
Of what they think.

313
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,410
You're a strange girl,
Laurel.

314
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:34,679
You give more back talk and less
cooperation than any girl on Capitol Hill.

315
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,152
I don't know why I put up with
you and your dog.

316
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,119
I don't know why
I just don't fire you.

317
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,520
Because I'm the best
political assistant you'll find

318
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,924
and you're still more interested
in politics than sex.

319
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,895
Charlie!

320
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,260
What is he barking at?

321
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,601
Charlie, what is it?

322
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,804
Listen.

323
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,397
They had U.S. markings.

324
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,094
- You sure of that?
- I thought so too.

325
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,637
Their speed!
Are they ours?

326
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,834
I don't know. But if they are ours,
they've kept them a close secret.

327
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,410
- I want inquiries made as soon as we return.
- Yes, Senator.

328

Bridge.

329
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,993
Skipper, the F-14s
are on top of the contact.

330
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,163
Alert 1, this is Eagle 1.
What have you got?

331
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,737
We've overflown
the craft, sir.

332
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,875
It's a civilian yacht,
flying U.S. flag

333
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,503
about 50 feet in length,
old but in mint condition.

334
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,439
- Over.
- Hold observation position.

<i>Cuts with a left to the body.</i>

340
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,638
- <i>Brings it up to the head.</i>
- Hey, who's that fighting?

341
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,716
- <i>Louis takes another left and a right.</i>
- I don't know.

342
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:49,516
<i>Louis is staggered by a right to the jaw.</i>
<i>He almost goes down.</i>

<i>You're better off</i>...

348
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,667
Let's get some air.

349
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,930
Captain's off the Bridge.

350
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,367
I don't know.

351
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:19,110
Dan, what's this all about?
What do you make of it?

352
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,047
Nostalgia broadcasting
on the Armed Forces band.

353
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,280
Broadcasting
after a strike? Nah.

354
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,755
Excuse me.

355
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,995
Sir, is it possible that this could be
part of some secret naval maneuver?

356
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,599
- Course not.
- There are a few people

357
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:41,034
- who'd like to watch us work under pressure.
- What are you saying, Dan?

358
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,231
The Department of Defense sent
him out here.

359
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,639
Maybe they wanted
to give him something to watch.

360
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,211
Now, that makes more sense
than anything else so far.

361
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:52,442
Now, wait a minute, gentlemen. You may
be the victims of some kind of joke.

362
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,074
But whether the Pentagon's
behind it

363
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,516
or the Kremlin
or some little green men from Mars

364
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,283
I promise you, I'm as much
in the dark about it as you are.

365
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,085
Captain, we're getting something
you might wanna hear.

366
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,852
- In the Plot Room.
- Aye, sir.

367
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:17,507
<i>The Germans are retreating</i>
<i>on the 70-mile front in southern Russia.</i>

368
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:22,204
<i>However, forces were reported</i>
<i>200 miles from Moscow</i>

369
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:26,077
<i>and long-range artillery fire</i>
<i>was heard in the suburbs of Moscow.</i>

370
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,311
- <i>Meanwhile in Washington</i>...
- What the hell's going on here?

371
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,581
Sir, I think you ought to see

372
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,919
these aerial reconnaissance
photographs of Pearl Harbor.

373
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,084
- Turn that off!
- Yes, sir.

374
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,219
That'll be all.
You.

375
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:51,233
- It's not Pearl Harbor.
- Sure as hell is.

376
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,469
Look at that old battle rig.

377
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:59,175
It's a memorial now.
It's the <i>Arizona.</i>

378
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:05,113
- But she's completely intact.
- That's right.

379
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,916
- Get Mr. Lasky back up here.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,893
What's the matter
with you?

381
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,437
I was just on the Bridge.
They're scared. Real scared.

382
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,439
- What happened?
- It's crazy.

383
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:28,170
The Russians, us,
even the Germans.

384
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:31,076
- We've finally done it.
- Done what, for Christ's sake?

385
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:36,585
- War. We're at war.
- You always talkin' shit.

386
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,554
I want a straight answer

387
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,927
and I don't give a damn about any orders
you've had elsewhere.

388
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,023
Is there something
you've held back?

389
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,568
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing, Captain.

390
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,505
All right.
I accept that.

391
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:03,376
Here's a photo taken by our reconnaissance
pilots less than an hour ago.

392
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,815
- May I suggest something, Captain?
- I'm wide open.

393
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,116
I suggest that you ask Commander Owens
to come up here right away

394
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,557
and bring the photos he's using
to illustrate his book.

395
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:17,991
Why?

396
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,565
I think he'll have something
very interesting to show you.

397
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,825
All right.

398
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:34,910
<i>Tanker, this is Alert 1. You got</i>
<i>two thirsty Tomcats. Whaddya got?</i>

<i>Pull right in.</i>

<i>and clean the windshield. Over.</i>

403
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,996
Dick, where'd you get these?

404
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,368
I got them from the Smithsonian, sir.
They're old agency photos of Pearl.

405
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,345
- Just like these.
- Not like these.

406
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,142
That one was taken
less than an hour ago.

407
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,476
I don't understand, sir.
These are pre-World War II pictures.

408
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,748
This is the fleet
that was destroyed.

409
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:24,590
Sir, C.I.C. reports two bogeys
at low altitude. Distance, 125 miles.

410
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:28,061
- Have our fighters take an I.D. pass.
- Aye, Captain.

411
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:36,933
Have our fighters investigate and
identify the contact 090, signal Buster.

412
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,804
Aye, sir. Alert 1,
this is Eagle Control.

413

<i>Tennessee, West Virginia.</i>

418
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,867
You're saying

419
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,698
that these are both photographs
of Pearl Harbor

420
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,568
on December 6, 1941?

421
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,873
Yes, sir.

422
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,882
Our reconnaissance plane
has just taken pictures

423
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,678
of something
that hasn't existed

424
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,481
for over 40 years.

425
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:28,887
Sir, we've got I.D.
on the bogeys.

426
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,487
- Captain's on the Bridge.
- What button?

427
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,497
Eleven, sir.

428
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:40,262
Alert 1, this is Eagle 1.
What have you got?

429
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,534
- <i>Two Japanese Zeros, sir.</i>
- <i>Two what?</i>

430
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:48,045
<i>Two trophy-class Mitsubishi</i>
<i>A6Ms in original condition</i>

<i>complete with all markings.</i>

432
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,179
- <i>I mean, they look brand new, sir.</i>
- Have you been spotted?

433
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,217
<i>Negative. We're right</i>
<i>on the side at 6:00 high.</i>

434
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,185
Stay in visual contact.
Take no action without clearance.

435
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,881
<i>Wilco, Eagle 1. Out.</i>

436
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,625
- Jack Benny and Rochester.
- And newscasts from World War II.

437
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,325
Somebody
for some reason

438
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,901
wants us to believe
that we're back in 1941.

439
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,028
- Now, who wants it?
- The Russians.

440
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,198
- Oh, Dan.
- Maybe. Power of psychology.

441
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,299
Excuse me, Captain

442
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,970
but we also have to consider
one alternative possibility.

443
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,511
What's that?

444
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,514
The possibility that what's
happening here is real.

445
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,208
Geez, that's ridiculous.

446
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,685
Maybe, but we have some
pretty strong evidence, sir.

447
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,416
Let's not just write off one
possible explanation for it

448
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,925
- because we don't happen to like it.
- How would that be possible?

449
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,394
- Could you explain that to me?
- No, sir, I can't.

450
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,965
But all of us know that movement
through time is possible.

451
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,590
Einstein proved it.

452
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,896
- In theory.
- In theory.

453
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,598
So all we have to do is move
through some storm at sea, and bingo...

454
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,037
we're all much more
clever than Einstein.

455
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,737
What sort of storm was that, Commander?
Certainly nothing like I've ever seen.

456
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,983
Nothing like any of us
have ever seen.

457
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,109
There are forces in the universe

458
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,180
which we're only now just
beginning to understand.

459
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,722
I mean, understand through science,
not superstition.

460
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,714
There are black holes in space,
antimatter, curved space...

461
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,355
things that are as strange to us

462
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,087
as electricity would have been
to people in the Middle Ages

463
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:16,097
or this ship
in World War II.

464
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:22,966
Well, crew is anxious
for an explanation too.

465
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,236
Now, we've gotta get
a clearer picture of all this.

466
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,672
Let's go to C.I.C.

467
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,166
Hey.

468
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,760
- What is it?
- Listen.

469
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,570
It's those planes again.

470
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,706
No, no.
Different noise entirely.

471
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,875
There they are.

472
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,705
- They're not ours, are they?
- No, certainly not.

473
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,173
They haveJapanese markings.

474
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,017
They're comin' in again.

475
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:56,232
Laurel, ask the captain
to radio Hawaii.

476
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,393
Find out aboutJapanese
fighter planes in the area.

477
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,562
Yes, Senator.

478
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,574
Oh, God! They're shooting!

479
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,685
Oh, my God.

480
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:29,526
- Oh, no.
- The captain send the message?

481
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,230
We've gotta
get off this boat.

482
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,465
Come on, Laurel!

483
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,344
<i>Eagle Control,</i>
<i>this is Alert 1.</i>

484
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,107
<i>They just strafed the hell</i>
<i>out of that yacht!</i>

485
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,909
Why would they
attack a yacht?

486
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:51,380
Their job would be to destroy anything
with a radio that could warn Pearl Harbor.

487
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,889
Providing you
and Mr. Einstein are correct.

488
00:44:55,025 --> 00:45:00,930
Dick, where would theJapanese fleet be
at this time on December 6, 1941?

489
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,895
Well, sir, they'd be off the scope

490
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,627
but an educated guess
would be around about here.

491
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:09,261
Excuse me. They'd have to be here,
up around the northwest sector.

492
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:12,142
Let's get this settled once and for all.
Have the E-2 check it out.

493
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,610
I wanna see if theJapanese
task force is out there.

494
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,002
Yes, sir.

495
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,550
<i>Eagle Control, Alert 1.</i>
<i>They're making another run.</i>

496
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,246
<i>Jesus! They'll shoot that</i>
<i>damn yacht to pieces!</i>

497
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,555
<i>Request permission</i>
<i>to arm and fire.</i>

498
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,750
- For God sakes, Skipper...
- Negative.

499
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,754
- Charlie? Charlie!
- No, Laurel! Not now!

500
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,630
Come on! Those planes are coming in!
Come on!

501
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,497
Let's go! Come on, Harvey!

502
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:56,184
<i>Eagle Control, they blew it to bits.</i>
<i>They must've hit the fuel tank!</i>

503
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,621
- Any survivors?
- <i>Stand by.</i>

504
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,986
<i>Affirmative.</i>
<i>One, two, three Mae Wests!</i>

505
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,460
Hey, wait a minute!
Those bastards are turning back!

506
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,225
They're gonna strafe them in the water!
Request permission to fire.

507
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,803
This is Eagle 1. You are cleared to arm,
but do not fire.

508
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,533
<i>Throw them off,</i>
<i>play with them, but don't fire.</i>

509
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,064
Affirmative.

510
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,480
- Sam! Sam.
- All right. It's all right. I'm all right.

511
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:28,476
Look up!

512
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,281
Oh, no!
They're coming again!

513
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,386
Harvey! Get that life preserver off
and dive!

514
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,588
I can't swim!

515
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:43,188
Here they come!

516
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,508
He's dead.

517
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,656
It's okay. Easy, boy.
Up you go.

518
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,712
Hey, Fox, that woke 'em up!

519
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,272
I think we should
give 'em another shot.

520
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,212
Why the hell are we
playing with these guys?

521
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,650
Radar shows enemy planes
heading on course, 220.

522
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,784
- 220.
- SweetJesus.

523
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,227
Skipper, they're headed
straight for us

524
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,663
and we've got an armed strike force
just sitting on the deck.

525
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,498
Alert 1, this is Eagle 1.
You're cleared to fire.

526
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:41,509
Splash the Zeros.
I say again, splash the Zeros.

527
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:45,978
- Yes, sir.
- This has gotta be a dream.
