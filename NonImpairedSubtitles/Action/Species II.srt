<i>Flight, this is INCO.</i>

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,917
<i>We should have good K.U. coverage</i>

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,510

<i>We show nominal de-orbit.</i>

22
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,349
Looks pretty good from this end.

23
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,799

<i>Loose topsoil is rock.</i>
<i>Drill bit shows signs of wear and tear.</i>

Sector 112, okay?

62
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,957
It might have been
a canal bed.

<i>In a world beset by violence,</i>

Houston, this is Excursion.

122
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,076
We had a malfunction
in the K.U. band antenna.

Lost telemetry and comm.

124

I performed a bit of I.F.M.

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,151
It's gonna be good to get home.
Over and out.

128
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,111
The Extraterrestrial
Vulnerability Experiment...

129
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,151
has one central goal:

130
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,109
to discover a means
to defend ourselves...

131
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,676
against the alien species
should they ever return to Earth.

132
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,919
Now, as you know, gentlemen,
Eve was re-created

133
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,712
from a frozen lab embryo.

134
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,354
She's a genetic duplicate
of the original Sil.

135
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,874
Now, we have deliberately
shielded Eve...

136
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,913
from any direct contact
with the male gender...

137
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,237
which is why, gentlemen,
you're inside there.

138
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,632
So...

139
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,555
proceed.

140
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,351
Help!

141
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,677
Laura! Please!

142
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,238
Okay, that's enough.
Bring her up.

143
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,959
Bingo, Dr. Baker!

144
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,670
It worked!

145
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,469
Take a look at those
beautiful welts.

146
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,916
Just beautiful.

147
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,512
What happened, Dr. Baker?

148
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,999
Our problem in a nutshell:
A toxic agent works once...

149
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,229
but then it becomes useless
once the alien's biology adapts.

150
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,837
You've gone out of your way
to give this... this lab animal...

151
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,918
a living situation
that's fit for a queen!

152
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,789
I suggest you spend more time
finding a way to 86 the damn thing.

153
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,158
Colonel, you're welcome
to replace me anytime you like.

154
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,635
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

155
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,116
Tell Dr. Baker
we must continue testing.

156
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,389
Aye, aye, sir.

157
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,711
Why do you do this to me?

158
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,633
I'm sorry, Eve.

159
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,158
I've explained to you
why we've got to do this...

160
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,555
what happened
with the first Sil.

161
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,072
And why you have to be prepared.

162
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,350
Survival of the fittest.
I know.

163
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,437
I watch this TV...

164
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,471
and I see all the places
I'm never gonna go...

165
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,115
and see all the people
I'm never gonna meet.

166
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,749
Is that all I am to you?

167
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,312
A laboratory animal?

168
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,589
I want you to understand
that the reason I took this job...

169
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,713
was to make sure that these experiments
were done with regard for you.

170
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,036
Just don't forget
that I'm human too.

171
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,792
<i>Main gear touchdown.</i>

172
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,075
<i>Shuttle ground support vehicles</i>
<i>with flight surgeon and medical team...</i>

173
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,350
<i>in the crew recovery vehicle</i>
<i>are en route.</i>

174
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,634
Thanks, Houston.
It's good to be home.

175
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,153
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

176
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,431
On preliminary examination, all three
of you are in remarkable health...

177
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,031
though, of course, I'll continue
more specific blood testing.

178
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,314
We do have a few people here
who would like a further examination.

179
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,637
Boy, there's enough fine booty
out there to cure what ails me.

180
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,473
You're under quarantine,
Mr. Gamble.

181
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,148
No sexual activity
for at least ten days.

182
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
- And that means all of you.
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

183
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,513
No, I'm not kidding.

184
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,154
<i>Back when President Kennedy</i>
<i>began the space program...</i>

185
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,989
I was just a very young
assistant up on the Hill.

186
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,112
It didn't take me long to realize
that he was a visionary...

187
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,158
and that I shared that vision.

188
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,392
Later on,
when I became a senator...

189
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,275
I was determined to push our program
even further into space.

190
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,952
And so today,
Jack Kennedy's vision...

191
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,869
is maintained by the commitment
of American business.

192
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,273
But I like to think
that his spirit is embodied...

193
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,755
in young men like Patrick Ross.

194
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,951
- When Patrick was five years old...
- What happened to Patrick?

195
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,313
I don't know, but he's missing some
major butt-kissing from his own father.

196
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,637
He hasn't been feeling
very well tonight.

197
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,559
Tell you the truth, I haven't
been feeling so great either.

198
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,594
Yeah, I think what we all need
is a little tender loving care.

199
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,832
So it's with pleasure that I introduce
one of our finest young leaders,

200
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,477
the captain of the Mars mission,

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,117
and my son, Patrick Ross.

202
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,349
I've gotta go.

203
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,393
Lincoln suite, upstairs.
Hurry.

204
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,236
Captain Ross, everyone's
waiting. This way, sir.

205
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,429
Nice of you to show up.

206
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,153
Thank you all
for coming out this evening.

207
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,749
Thank you, Father,

208
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,474
for what I'm sure
were overly kind words.

209
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,757
I've been chosen
on behalf of my wonderful crew...

210
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,113
to represent
the mission to Mars...

211
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,512
and an image
that comes to my mind...

212
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,874
is looking through the porthole...

213
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,713
at the blue-white globe...

214
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,795
beautiful...

215
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,072
so fragile, so small.

216
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,352
And I thought to myself...

217
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,555
how easy it would be to destroy
all that God has created.

218
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,030
I think, as we look
to the future...

219
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,036
our greatest mission
might be right here at home.

220
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,474
It's open.

221
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,236
Come on in.

222
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,797
My sister decided to join us.

223
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,792
We share everything...

224
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,076
together.

225
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,479
<i>Parker's going for two,</i>
<i>and he's in there, standing!</i>

226
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,515
Pulse rate is 20 percent
below human norm.

227
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,435
What do you expect, Brea?
She's watching baseball.

228
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,071
Oh, God!

229
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,958
You are a hero.

230
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,668
Oh, God.

231
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,034
It's my turn.

232
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,435
Yes, it is.

233
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,874
<i>Here it comes!</i>
<i>Parker's going for three!</i>

234
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,758
Jeez! Did someone hit a home run?

235
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,551
My God, help me!

236
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,508
Get off me!

237
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,356
Marcy! Get him off me!

238
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,918
Oh, my God!

239
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,671
Help me, someone!

240
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,635
- What the hell is going on?
- My God!

241
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,197
Last night,
after the fund-raiser...

242
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,799
something happened.

243
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,469
I try to think about it,
I draw a total blank.

244
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,477
They always make those drinks
at those fund-raisers strong.

245
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,631
That's the way they get
the wallets to open up.

246
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,991
Billy, you tell that old son-of-a-bitch
I won't take no for an answer.

247
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,191
There's something wrong with me,
Dad, since I got back.

248
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,155
Do you think
a trip to Mars was rough?

249
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,478
You just wait till you try
a senate campaign.

250
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,957
Dad, listen to me.
I'm having...

251
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,711
I'm having
some kind of breakdown.

252
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,234
Stop thinking about the master plan
and help me, all right? I'm scared.

253
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,116
Goddamn it!
Quit acting like a spoiled child.

254
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,396
You're a Ross.
Behave like one.

255
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,869
And I'm gonna give you
a piece of advice, boy.

256
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,192
You keep your dick in your pants
and your eyes on the prize.

257
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,193
Oh, I know what you been doin<i>',</i>
and frankly, I don't give a damn.

258
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,358
But I have seen too many young men
with promising careers...

259
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,592
piss it all away
on a piece of ass.

260
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,793
People love you, Patrick.
Hell, boy, they idolize you.

261
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,428
You're gonna be President
of the United States someday.

262
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,072
Now, let's take a walk
through the gallery.

263
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,396
Some of my illustrious colleagues
are just dyin' to get your autograph.

264
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,630
Yes, sir.

265
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,918
Yes, it's very important
that I speak with Herman Cromwell.

266
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,078
No, he's a patient there.

267
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,156
<i>Well, can I get a message to him</i>
<i>that Dr. Orinsky called</i>

268
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,914
<i>from the lab at Oldham Space Center</i>
<i>up in Maryland?</i>

269
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,756
<i>Yes, it's very important</i>
<i>that I speak to him.</i>

270
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,871
<i>I'm an old colleague of his.</i>

271
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,478
I can't believe this.

272
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,833
Oh, my God!

273
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,871
Company, halt! Left, left...

274
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,389
<i>The substance found</i>

275
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,111
<i>in Dr. Orinsky's wounds</i>
<i>is combinant alien-human DNA.</i>

276
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,558
<i>This DNA is structurally</i>
<i>similar to Eve's...</i>

277
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,519
but it's not a perfect match.

278
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,950
Obviously, Eve
has not left the compound...

279
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,119
which means, gentlemen,
that there's another one out there.

280
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,429
None of our intelligence suggests
that a foreign power was involved.

281
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,872
How do we start looking
for this thing?

282
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,194
Well, I would suggest
normal investigative procedure...

283
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,029
to cultivate a list of possible suspects
and then test their blood.

284
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,309
Thank you, Dr. Baker. We may ask you
to help us track it down.

285
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,517
<i>Always a pleasure, gentlemen.</i>

286
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,269
Get Press Lennox.

287
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,151
Ladies and gentlemen,
the embassy is secure.

288
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,598
The hostages are free.

289
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,630
Press Lennox.

290
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,312
Diplomatic security.
Provides embassy guards...

291
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,799
and protects against...

292
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,590
kidnapping and assassination...

293
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,990
and also, of course,
special services...

294
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,078
like the demonstration
we witnessed here today.

295
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,318
Excuse me, Mr. Lennox.
Somebody needs to see you right away.

296
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,793
My assistant will answer
any questions you might have.

297
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,513
Thank you all very much.

298
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,070
Ladies and gentlemen, are there
any questions I can answer?

299
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,513
Are you equipped with
night vision attack capabilities?

300
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,118
That was really, really great.

301
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,835
Well?

302
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,753
The answer is no.

303
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,276
Press, we got another
fucking alien on the loose.

304
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,429
Get somebody else.

305
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,588
Come on, buddy.
Your country calls.

306
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,472
Don't start waving the flag.

307
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,117
I'm in the private sector now.
I've got a business to run.

308
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,630
Look at me, Press.
You know how I got this goddamn eye.

309
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,914
It's a sacrifice I'd make
again in a heartbeat.

310
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,518
But then maybe you haven't learned
the meaning of sacrifice.

311
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,394
Listen, pal.

312
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,672
The last time I fought
with that alien she-bitch...

313
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,036
I almost got myself killed.

314
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,512
If the government was stupid
enough to make another one...

315
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,550
I think they can clean up
the mess by themselves.

316
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,670
We didn't make this one.

317
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,718
Count me out of
the search party, okay?

318
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,549
Where is my fucking key?

319
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,034
A million dollars, tax free.

320
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,715
Sure you won't reconsider?

321
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,711
Welcome to Biohazard Four.
Dr. Baker!

322
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,515
Come out here!

323
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,275
Oh, my God.

324
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,037
Open the doors!
Somebody open the doors!

325
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,312
Get him away from there!

326
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,313
Somebody open the doors!

327
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,559
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

328
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,508
You know there's no men allowed
in this lab. Get away!

329
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,870
- Calm down, Dr. Baker.
- Do you have respect for this?

330
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,152
- Out now, both of you!
- We have an emergency.

331
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,918
Okay, we'll take it outside.

332
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,714
- Damn well right we'll take it outside.
- Don't blow a gasket.

333
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,399
Don't patronize me.

334
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,989
We're not patronizing.
We're coming along.

335
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,029
Close the doors.

336
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,750
Laura, correct me if I'm wrong.

337
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,951
Are you involved
in this crazy bullshit?

338
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,949
Dr. Baker runs this facility.
She cloned the Sil embryo.

339
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,239
Oh. Okay, well,
what should I call her?

340
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,591
Sil Lite?

341
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,039
- Her name is Eve.
- Eve. How very biblical.

342
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,912
We have dampened
her mating instinct.

343
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,793
We have strictly avoided the presence
of testosterone in this lab.

344
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,434
At least until now.
Thank you for your help in that area.

345
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,554
What if she gets
out of there?

346
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,079
She's electronically tethered
to a control box.

347
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,034
One step off the premises, and
a toxic capsule explodes in her brain.

348
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,316
You know, it's really great
to see you again...

349
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,239
and I was hoping we'd meet
under better circumstances...

350
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,672
but, I remember Laura Baker
having a little bit more soul.

351
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,430
Just who the hell
do you think you are?

352
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,677
You're coming into my lab,
questioning my motives!

353
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,756
Are you two finished?

354
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,680
We have a national fucking emergency
on our hands!

355
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,589
Now, you two
will work together.

356
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,870
That's a direct order
from the Pentagon.

357
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,675
You killed one of these fucking
alien things before. Do it again.

358
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,715
You heard the man.
Now the fun begins.

359
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,030
<i>I went over Orinsky's phone records,</i>
<i>and this is the last place he called.</i>

360
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,630
<i>There's a patient named</i>
<i>Herman Cromwell.</i>

361
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,800
Turns out he taught Orinsky
at Stanford.

362
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,959
And what exactly
is Cromwell doing here?

363
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,077
Well, that's
the interesting part.

364
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,398
It's classified
top-secret information.

365
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,275
I was doing research
on a Mars meteorite.

366
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,270
The one found
in the Antarctic in '96?

367
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,079
Fossils in the meteorite convinced us
there might have been life on Mars.

368
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,639
But these fossils weren't anything
organic to the planet. Oh, no.

369
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,838
And what was the basis
for that determination?

370
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,793
Carbon-based elements
in the fossils...

371
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,878
exist only
in the Magellanic galaxy.

372
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,915
That's 100 million
light years away.

373
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,914
Well, how did they get to Mars?

374
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,393
By my reckoning...

375
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,355
Mars was visited
by an alien species...

376
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,596
approximately
one billion years ago.

377
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,036
The species was like
a plague, a cancer.

378
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,359
It turned a thriving planet with...

379
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,156
rivers and oceans
and rudimentary plant life...

380
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,271
into a useless hunk of rock.

381
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,270
When I heard they were going
to send a mission to Mars...

382
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,596
I strongly urged the government
to reconsider.

383
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,634
On what grounds?

384
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,471
On grounds that alien DNA
might remain on the planet...

385
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,430
that any human attempt
to violate the planet...

386
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,473
would result
in biological contamination.

387
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,629
So, let me guess. They told you
to shove it up your ass.

388
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,116
They got me fired from Stanford.

389
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,518
It seems the military had strategic
reasons for wanting to go to Mars.

390
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,237
Outpost of the future,
or some crap like that.

391
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,440
Anyway, they harassed
the shit out of me.

392
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,192
I got into a fistfight
with a Pentagon general...

393
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,399
and broke his goddamn jaw.

394
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,391
That's why they stuck you
in here, right?

395
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,438
Why do you think that Dr. Orinsky
called you the night that he died?

396
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,917
To tell me I was right.

397
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,357
Whatever species destroyed Mars...

398
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,472
those poor astronauts
brought down to Earth.

399
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,468
May God have pity on our souls.

400
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,875
<i>I'll tell you one thing.</i>
<i>For General Lee...</i>

401
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,629
<i>to be eatin' up the road</i>
<i>this early in the mornin'...</i>

402
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,759
<i>something's sure got</i>
<i>Bo and Luke all head up.</i>

403
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,155
<i>I figure it's got somethin'</i>
<i>to do with women.</i>

404
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,230
<i>Or huntin'.</i>
<i>Or maybe wheels.</i>

405
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,759
The temperature on Mars
is approximately 225 degrees below zero.

406
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,110
If they brought the samples on board,
the temperature thaw...

407
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,834
could have brought the DNA
back to life.

408
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,668
That DNA could have infected
the astronauts.

409
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,872
This isn't the fucking X Files,
goddamn it!

410
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,594
You are following a lead
based on the interrogation...

411
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,552
of a certified nutcase.

412
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,914
We got one dead N.S.E.G. doctor...

413
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,148
we have a guy who warned
the government not to go to Mars...

414
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,191
they slapped him in a loony bin...

415
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,350
and a seven-minute time gap
during the space flight.

416
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,956
We need to do blood analysis
on Sampas, Gamble and Ross.

417
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,272
Now, I know that there is
a sexual quarantine of ten days...

418
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,359
on all interplanetary missions,
and the Mars quarantine ends tonight.

419
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,836
They could fuck the human race
into extinction.

420
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,468
You want to be responsible for that
if we don't start testing everybody now?

421
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,514
Test Patrick first.

422
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,957
Yeah.

423
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,154
I've been waiting
to get you alone.

424
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,911
All the interviews,
all the screaming girls...

425
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,839
all the hoopla...

426
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,990
gone.

427
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,871
Push it out of your mind.

428
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,593
Patrick Ross...

429
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,869
tonight...

430
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,269
you're mine.

431
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,988
I love you.

432
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,999
What's the matter?

433
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,834
I don't know.
We should hold off.

434
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,395
Oh, no. No, you don't.
Not tonight.

435
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,591
Come on, Missy.
I don't feel so good.

436
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,629
Relax.

437
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,278
Let me do the work.

438
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,754
There's nobody here.

439
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,598
Where the fuck did he go?

440
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,878
Let's go find the others.

441
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,192
I missed you up there.

442
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,918
I missed you so much.

443
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,912
It's so beautiful.

444
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,637
Not as beautiful as you are.

445
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,794
Charmer.

446
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,833
Take it easy, Press.
You're gonna get us killed.

447
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,429
Trust me, Laura.
I got a bad feeling in my stomach.

448
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,916
God, I missed making love
with you.

449
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,670
Oh, my stomach!

450
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,313
- Oh, my God!
- Call someone!

451
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,192
Call for help!

452
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,915
Up here. Come on!

453
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,314
No, please!

454
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,831
Oh, God.

455
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,593
I'm gonna get a full crew.

456
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,353
I'm gonna get 'em over here
right away.

457
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,752
We gotta get to the others.

458
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,718
Oh, this is awful.

459
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,555
This is just awful.

460
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,749
I'll take her the rest of the way.

461
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,109
Have a good evening.

462
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,759
This is nice.

463
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,632
You thought I lived on a tugboat.

464
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,832
I know what you thought.
But I got it all under control now.

465
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,836
Oh, you do?

466
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,759
Yeah, you just slide
right over there.

467
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,359
Let me open this door.

468
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,790
There we go.
Hey, girl.

469
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,192
- Is that it?
- No, honey, that's not it.

470
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,594
Right there.

471
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,028
No, that's not it.

472
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,828
Oh, that's it.

473
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,069
What's wrong?

474
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,588
Dennis Gamble, we'd like you
to come with us.

475
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,838
Man, a brother just can't get no booty.
You know what I'm sayin'?

476
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,557
This is no way to treat a national hero.
This is embarrassing.

477
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,269
What is this all about?
Look, somebody speak to me.

478
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,999
Hey, I'm a personal friend
of Senator Judson Ross, okay?

479
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,033
Personal friend. I'm gonna eat
your badge for breakfast.

480
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,912
Get your hand
off my head, man.

481
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,156
I demand an explanation.

482
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,991
We'll have the test results
in a few minutes.

483
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,192
Why am I being tested?
N.S.E.G. said I was fine.

484
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,709
Sit tight, son.
We'll explain everything later.

485
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,195
Well, it's kind of tough
to sit tight, sir.

486
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,833
I haven't been laid in 11 months.

487
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,309
That's unusual for me.

488
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,318
Take it easy, Burgess.
Everybody deserves an explanation.

489
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,589
You're damn right.

490
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,031
And what's with all these guards?
What the hell is going on around here?

491
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,398
It's purely
a precautionary measure.

492
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,550
We need a couple of minutes
for the blood analysis, so just relax.

493
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,832
Couple of questions.

494
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,079
What can you tell us about the seven
minutes when the Excursion lost contact?

495
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,996
I can't remember.

496
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,558
I don't know if I blacked out,
I can't remember.

497
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,599
When did you last speak
to Anne Sampas?

498
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,198
At that fund-raiser
the other night.

499
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,276
Did she act peculiar?

500
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,989
She seemed fine to me.

501
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,396
What's this all about?
Something happen to her?

502
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,669
You tell me.

503
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,519
What happened to Anne Sampas?

504
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,519
Tell me what happened to her!

505
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,588
Anne Sampas is dead.

506
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,159
I'm sorry, Dennis.

507
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,356
Yeah. Laura.

508
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,790
Well, the combinant DNA in Anne's body
doesn't match what I found in Orinsky's.

509
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,715
So, it's either Gamble or Ross.

510
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,554
Be careful, Press.

511
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,038
What was the cause of death?

512
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,309
We don't know.

513
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,839
Come on.
How the hell did she die?

514
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,598
Sequence almost complete.

515
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,155
- Why are you testing my blood?
- Ten seconds till relay.

516
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,715
- You think I killed Annie?
- Data retrieval on-line.

517
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,353
- Is that what you think?
- Five seconds. Three seconds.

518
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,199
I didn't kill her! I swear!

519
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,794
Computer says normal.
There is no sign of infection.

520
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,470
- Go home, get some rest.
- Look, I want answers!

521
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,114
In due time.
We'll be in touch.

522
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,317
Yo, Gamble.

523
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,113
You know where Patrick Ross is?

524
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,396
Nope.

525
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,749
Well, if you see him,
you'll let me know, yeah?

526
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,396
Sure.

527
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,995
Well, let's see what
the cranial cavity has to say.

528
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,190
Now I'll just reach
behind her ear, and we should...

529
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,436
God.

530
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,716
Patrick, no!

531
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,434
Want a date, mister?

532
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,510
I was scared, man.

533
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,631
This is crazy.

534
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,959
His whole head just grew right back
like some sort of damn freak show.

535
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,750
The alien species
can regenerate living tissue.

536
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,759
Aliens, little green men.

537
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,508
I still can't believe it.

538
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,188
If they knew there were aliens
up there, why did they send us?

539
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,198
N.S.E.G. got warned
but they chose to ignore it.

540
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,994
We think that there was some hostile DNA
in the soil samples that you collected.

541
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,439
Something happened up there.

542
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,469
I can't remember exactly.

543
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,119
I just know it was terrible.

544
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,276
I'm sure that it was terrible.

545
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,153
The question is:
How do we proceed now?

546
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,837
I got guys out there all over the place
looking for this kid.

547
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,873
Any place he might be.
We're gonna find him sooner or later.

548
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,954
If he's reproducing,
we've got potential offspring.

549
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,996
I think it's safe to assume he's banging
cocktail waitresses two at a time.

550
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,514
Well, then in less than two weeks,
these offspring reach adolescence...

551
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,358
and then they enter
the chrysalis stage.

552
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,556
Chrysalis stage?

553
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,118
A cocoon which
turns them into adults.

554
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,194
Hey, baby,
turn that car around.

555
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,159
Hey, don't leave me.
Come on.

556
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,833
Hi, honey.

557
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,870
Baby, come back.

558
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,233
<i>A serial killer may be loose</i>
<i>in the Washington-Maryland area.</i>

559
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,273
<i>Authorities have asked the public</i>
<i>to be extremely cautious...</i>

560
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,596
<i>when approached by strangers.</i>

561
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,074
How much for number three?

562
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,917
Twenty an hour.

563
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,953
<i>Thank you, Linda.</i>
<i>And now for the financial news.</i>

564
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,799
Twenty, forty, sixty.

565
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,195
Thank you much.

566
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,149
Enjoy yourself.

567
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,390
Come in.

568
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,753
See what I mean, Laura?
Every so often, her rates go berserk.

569
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,639
Fifty agents we got out there
looking for this guy.

570
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,674
We got nothing.

571
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,351
Man, how can you
just touch that?

572
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,438
Occupational hazard.

573
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,350
So, you didn't see nothing,
didn't hear nothing, don't know nothing?

574
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,391
They come and they go.
You know what I mean?

575
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,989
They come and they go.

576
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,196
Oh, that's hysterical.
Sit your ass down.

577
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,197
They come, they go.
You get it?

578
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,237
Oh, yeah, I get it.
Here you go.

579
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,190
Thanks.

580
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,113
We're wasting time.

581
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,788
It's been two days,
and Lennox hasn't made any headway.

582
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,197
Maybe that's because you gentlemen
won't allow us to go public.

583
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,355
Dr. Baker,

584
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,120
you said that Eve
has telepathic abilities.

585
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,150
Some.

586
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,679
Can we send her after Patrick?

587
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,235
It'd be foolish to take her
out of a controlled atmosphere.

588
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,589
There's the danger of escape.

589
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,598
Then we'd have two aliens loose,
instead of one.

590
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,872
If these two were to mate, the resulting
pure strain of offspring...

591
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,877
would be unstoppable.

592
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,629
Well, can she tell us where he is
without leaving the lab?

593
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,190
We've seen spiking
in her biorhythms...

594
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,550
which indicate
a rudimentary connection...

595
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,990
but half her alien genes
are dormant.

596
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,433
Tracking Patrick
is out of her league.

597
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,831
Dormant means asleep.

598
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,319
Is there any way
that we can wake them up?

599
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,951
We could use the lab's
cyclotron...

600
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,072
to bombard her with radiation
that would awaken her dormant genes.

601
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,633
But there is a problem.

602
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,636
What's that?

603
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,353
We make her more alien.

604
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,437
We increase her strength,
her anger.

605
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,631
Her mating drive
would go through the roof.

606
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,633
It's worth the risk.
We'll tighten security.

607
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,193
She is not a lab animal.

608
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,193
She is half-human.

609
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,119
Please, Baker, spare us
the alien rights agenda.

610
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,389
Put her in the cyclotron.

611
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,789
And what if I refuse?

612
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,630
That's your prerogative.
She's gonna go in anyway.

613
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,352
Gentlemen.

614
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,198
Don't worry, Laura.

615
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,753
I know what they want.

616
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,272
I'm sorry. This is not what I intended.
It's gonna be very painful for you.

617
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,234
I want to help.

618
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,312
I'm going to radiate for 45 seconds
then shut it down.

619
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,478
I'm connected, Laura.

620
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,358
I see what he sees.

621
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,229
<i>He's driving down a small street.</i>

622
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,668
<i>I see two-story buildings...</i>

623
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,792
<i>a man walking a small dog.</i>

624
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,629
They're stopping at a stoplight.

625
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,513
Okay, here we go!

626
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,752
<i>I see street signs.</i>

627
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,748
Gwynn's Falls and Warwick!

628
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,556
- Intersection of Gwynn's Falls...
- He's in a parking lot!

629
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,718
- What?
<i>- Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.</i>

630
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,909
Gwynn's Falls?

631
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,870
Where?

632
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,354
That's in Reservoir Hill!

633
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,118
There's a big supermarket!

634
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,756
He's going into the supermarket
near Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.

635
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,879
Hang on to your shorts!

636
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,511
- He's going after a woman!
- Let's go!

637
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,350
How the hell did you get
a drivers' license?

638
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,874
Where is he?

639
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,715
Aisle one. Fruits and vegetables!

640
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,592
He's in aisle one,
fruits and vegetables.

641
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,634
We're there. Now what?

642
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,309
Come on, Press!

643
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,750
My God! It's you!

644
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,152
- Will you sign my Space Flakes box?
- Sure.

645
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,670
You got a pen?

646
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,394
I do.

647
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,311
What's your name?

648
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:39,797
Darlene.

649
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,310
"Darlene."

650
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,234
You know a secret?

651
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,956
I think Space Flakes taste like shit.

652
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,872
- Which row?
- Cereal!

653
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,079
Come on, Press.

654
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,475
Watch it!

655
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,633
Where's the goddamn cereal?

656
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,431
Nice to meet you.

657
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,789
Really nice to meet you.

658
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,472
It's her!

659
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,511
Help me!

660
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,789
Which way?

661
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,074
Quick! Which way?

662
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:12,996
What she say?

663
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,638
They're going down some stairs.

664
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,956
A basement! Find a basement!

665
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,315
<i>It's dark.</i>

666
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,949
He wants to mate with her!

667
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,469
Get away!

668
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,550
Get up!

669
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,396
Shut up!

670
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,549
Help!

671
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,151
Get down!

672
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,954
- Damn it!
- No!

673
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,835
Help!

674
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,195
He's trying to rape her!

675
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,678
Man, don't shoot!

676
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,075
Why don't you get a motel?

677
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,149
Fuckin' kids.

678
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,674
He knows I'm tapping in.

679
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,678
Help! Leave me alone!
Stop!

680
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,719
Get off me!

681
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,632
Eve...

682
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,391
Patrick!

683
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,235
Go on! Get out of here!

684
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,195
Get out!

685
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,711
- Don't move, spaceman.
- Put down the gun.

686
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,756
Get your hands up!

687
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,395
Get 'em up!

688
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,595
What is this?

689
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,158
You can't deny some bugged-out stuff
going on around here.

690
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,830
What kind of stuff?

691
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,670
You told me yourself
you were feeling weird.

692
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,270
You gotta go in for tests, bro.

693
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,880
Sure. I don't mind
going into the lab.

694
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:34,831
Open the gate.

695
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,794
What's going on?

696
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,798
Estrogen level's peaking.
It's like she's in heat.

697
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,515
Let me out!

698
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,150
Let me out!

699
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,675
Let's go.

700
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,993
Has she been given
any medication?

701
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,315
Yes, her usual dose.

702
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,555
Let me out, Laura!

703
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,988
I'm going to double it.

704
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,110
Let me out!

705
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,675
Listen to me, Laura...

706
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,477
Laura!

707
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,192
Code 459 alert. Patrick Ross
in Biohazard Four. Seal the compound!

708
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,078
Get out of there, Sherry!

709
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,430
Patrick, leave her alone!

710
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,550
Open the door.

711
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,711
I know what you're going through,
and I can help you.

712
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,240
- Let me help you.
- Open the goddamn door.

713
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,036
I can't do that.

714
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,112
I'm sorry.

715
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,799
- Open it!
- I can't...

716
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,908
Get away from her now!

717
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,954
The proof is incontrovertible.

718
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,954
Your son was infected
up in that capsule.

719
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,958
I'm sorry, Senator.

720
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,879
Jesus God.

721
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,269
Rest assured
we'll deal with this quietly.

722
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,869
Medical treatment, the best doctors.

723
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,399
The last thing this country needs

724
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,512
is a spectacle with a national hero
being publicly compromised.

725
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,638
Cut the crap, Carter.

726
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,559
What the hell are we gonna do?

727
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,188
Two imperatives:

728
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,312
We have to find Patrick
and bring him in immediately.

729
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,718
We have to neutralize any possibility
that this could leak to the media.

730
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,195
The generals are very concerned.

731
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,320
They're gonna kill him, aren't they?

732
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,915
We need to find your son.

733
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,633
You listen to me,
you arrogant son-of-a-bitch.

734
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,752
If you touch a hair on his head...

735
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,992
you will rue the day you were born!

736
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,950
You make it very hard
to help you, Senator.

737
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,878
Go fuck yourself!

738
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,318
What the hell did you think I'd do?
Stand here and let you take my son?

739
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,869
I'll call the goddamn President
if I have to.

740
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,149
Listen carefully, old man.

741
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,280
This is way beyond the President.
Way beyond.

742
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,553
You wanna save Patrick?

743
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,038
Help us bring him in.

744
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,157
Damn, man! What is up?
I can't even get no play from an alien.

745
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,156
Some people carry a disease
in their genetic code.

746
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,828
The possibility exists it might be
passed on to their children.

747
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,994
Those N.S.E.G. doctors
told me I had sickle trait.

748
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,831
It's in your chart.
You don't have sickle-cell anemia,

749
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,554
which is why you were able
to go to Mars. But you're a carrier.

750
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:13,997
Right.

751
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,996
Well, I guess that's why
he didn't get infected up on the ship.

752
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,317
Right. Alien DNA cannot cope
with human genetic flaws.

753
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,193
It has no defense against our diseases,
and that might be our answer.

754
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,833
What could be the answer?

755
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,917
Alien DNA infected us.
It's about time we infected them.

756
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,310
What?

757
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,077
Patrick...

758
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,154
Dad, what are you doing here?

759
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,515
I kind of figured
you'd show up here.

760
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,838
You always used to love this place
as a child.

761
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,154
So did your mother.

762
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,749
I never could convince her
to get rid of it.

763
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,915
Yeah, I used to come here
when I was courting her.

764
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,151
- And after she died...
- What do you want?

765
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,430
Well...

766
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,669
First off, I'd like to apologize.

767
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,749
Apologize for what?

768
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:37,876
Oh, Paddy.

769
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,756
Don't bother.

770
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,078
They told me what happened...

771
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,194
how you got infected up on Mars.

772
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,993
I'm sorry, Paddy... for not listening
when you asked for help.

773
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,669
You never listened.

774
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,599
I'm listening now.

775
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,908
They're gonna kill me.

776
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,397
Not if I can help it.

777
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,550
Now, there's no way
that they can find you here.

778
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,796
This property's still listed
under you mother's maiden name.

779
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,239
And I sure as hell am not gonna hand
you over to those Pentagon bastards.

780
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,390
No, sir.

781
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,991
I'm taking you in to Johns Hopkins...
for treatment with the best.

782
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,119
We'll walk through that door together.

783
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,509
Come in with me, son.

784
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,470
No.

785
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,597
I know you won't do it for me.

786
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,476
But try to think of your mother.

787
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,879
Do it for her.

788
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,634
Dad, help me.

789
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,629
It's okay.

790
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,829
It's okay.

791
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,716
Eve...

792
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,674
We need your help again
to find Patrick.

793
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,032
I'm sorry, Laura.
I can't do that.

794
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,788
We could just call in
the National Guard.

795
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,795
Sorry, pal.
This is strictly a private mission.

796
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,752
Yeah, well, I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.

797
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,309
You haven't been one of those

798
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,229
in 11 months.

799
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,913
Why you gotta bring that up?

800
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,715
Okay, I was a lover. I sure as hell
ain't no damned bounty hunter.

801
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,918
This looks about right.

802
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,357
What?
That little, old tiny ass thing?

803
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,832
You ain't got
no bazookas up in here?

804
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,315
Bazookas?

805
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,916
Hasn't anyone ever told you
that size doesn't matter?

806
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,990
I mean, you can talk all that noise
if you want to.

807
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,351
I'm taking this because I'm about
to go back to Africa on somebody's ass.

808
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:41,313
I've used Dennis' blood sample
as the basis for this toxin.

809
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,189
Of course, I have no idea
whether or not this is going to work.

810
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,357
It's an interesting idea.
It might be the only chance we got.

811
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,152
But what if it doesn't work?

812
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,473
Well, then, my friend,

813
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,070
we're fucked.

814
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:22,836
Get the tether!

815
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:23,916
<i>Containment breach.</i>

816
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,395
We're locked in here!

817
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,795
<i>Electronic tether,</i>
<i>armed for activation</i>

818
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,275
<i>in five, four...</i>

819
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,195
<i>three, two, one.</i>

820
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:36,916
It's stuck.

821
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,311
Get back!

822
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,992
<i>Security breach, code red,</i>
<i>level four.</i>

823
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,038
Colonel, there's a lot
of activity below.

824
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,435
Keep your distance.
Let's see what's going on.

825
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:22,711
Fire!

826
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,230
Come on.

827
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,997
Get in the humvees! Let's go! Now!

828
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,873
You heard him! Go!

829
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,591
How in the hell
does she know how to drive?

830
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,995
Her favorite show's
<i>The Dukes of Hazard.</i>

831
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,997
Fan-fuckin'-tastic.

832
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,914
<i>Burgess, this is General Metzger.</i>

833
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,351
<i>Maintain your pursuit</i>
<i>but do not engage alien escapee.</i>

834
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,438
<i>Let Press Lennox do his job.</i>
<i>Is that clear?</i>

835
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,029
Roger. Back off, Captain.

836
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:56,471
I don't wanna crash this party
until just the right time.

837
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,989
Stop right here.

838
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,832
Grab that spray canister.

839
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,553
Be careful with that thing.

840
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,711
Jesus Christ!

841
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,470
Welcome to the maternity ward...

842
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,829
from hell.

843
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,110
Patrick's offspring.

844
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,870
I'm gonna go up and see if I can find
Adam and Eve.

845
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,672
Press, this isn't Eve's fault.
She's human too.

846
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,270
Like them.

847
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,920
What's wrong?
My DNA ain't good enough?

848
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,233
You let me live on that ship
so I can die in this goddamn barn?

849
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,518
Fuck you!
Fuck all you pig motherfuckers!

850
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,195
I'm about to get straight
Kunta Kinte on your ass!

851
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,075
Dennis!

852
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:12,951
It's working!

853
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,271
Score one for human DNA, baby!

854
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,716
Why don't you get those?
I'm going up here.

855
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,399
Just do your thing, baby.

856
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:01,751
Die!

857
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,555
Thank you.

858
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,196
You're welcome.

859
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,590
Eve, get out of the way!

860
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,238
What the hell is going on in here?

861
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,475
Stay back!

862
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,149
Oh, my God!

863
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,556
Eve, I know you're in there!
Please help us!

864
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:55,955
Please, help us!

865
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,110
Press!

866
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,315
Get up! Quick!

867
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,477
Quick!

868
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,549
You killed her,

869
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,910
you disgusting son-of-a-bitch!

870
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,553
Press, use my blood! Quick!

871
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,110
Get up!

872
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,512
When did you start smoking?

873
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,755
Just now.

874
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,275
I wonder if I should have
this stuff analyzed.

875
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,038
Yeah, maybe you should.

876
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,993
You might turn into a sexual predator.

877
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,839
- Yeah, I guess that's possible.
- It'd be okay with me.

878
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,234
I have a drag?

879
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,228
- All right, one, two, three.
- Up!

880
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,716
- Easy.
- Got it.

881
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,712
Oh, now y'all show up...
after we do all the work.

882
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,399
I wanna talk to the general.

883
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,749
Know what I'm saying?

884
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,235
Mr. Gamble,

885
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,717
I need you to lie back for me.

886
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:41,390
- Yes, I'll be glad to.
- Nice and easy.

887
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,079
Looks like you're gonna be all right.

888
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:45,955
I'm fine, brother.

889
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,556
Be seeing you.

890
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,113
I hear you had a rough day.

891
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,116
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Well.

892
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,992
I've been killing aliens all night.

893
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,188
Know what I'm saying?
