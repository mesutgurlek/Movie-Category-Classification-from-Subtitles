1
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,995
lt all began a very long time ago,

2
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,273
when a merchant ship was set upon
by pirates of the Sengh Brotherhood.

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,110
A small boy watched helplessly as
his father was killed by the pirate leader,

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,436
the Evil Kabai Sengh.

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,029
Hejumped overboard
and was washed ashore

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,152
on a mysteriousjungle island
called Bengalla.

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,512
lt seemed like a case of
''out of the frying pan and into the ire'',

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,030
but the Touganda tribesmen
meant the boy no harm.

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,676
They scooped him up
and carried him to their village.

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,236
And that night, in an ancient
ceremony of ire and drums,

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,594
the tribal shaman presented the boy
wlth a ring of great significance.

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,509
The boy understood that he was
destined to avenge his father's death

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,748
by fighting piracy, greed and cruelty
in all their forms.

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,997
When he grew to be a man,
he became the Phantom.

15
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,592
- Damn worthless map!
- You drive, l'll navigate.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,917
- The map is all wrong.
- The map is good, Quill.

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,395
Remember its source.
lt can't be wrong.

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,354
Then why does it show a bridge back
there? We never crossed any bridge.

19
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,471
- What's he saying, Morgan?
- 'urn around.''

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,989
- We'd better turn around.
- Not a chance!

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,795
Maybe this little quitter
needs a lesson in positive thinking.

22
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,759
Quill, now l get it.
Turn the map around.

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,476
- lt's upside-down, you big moron!
- You big moron!

24
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,877
lf the map is upside-down,
there ought to be a bridge up ahead.

25
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,355
All l see is more jungle.

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,709
Oh, shit!

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,752
Hey, Quill! No sudden stops.
What's the big idea?

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,157
Hey, take a look at that.

29
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,754
- What do you think?.
- l don't know.

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,032
lt looks like it'll hold,
but then again...

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,356
Breen? Styles?

32
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,279
- l'd hate to bet my life on it, Quill.
- Same here.

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,198
OK.

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,198
We'll go over on foot.
All except one.

35
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,391
He'll stay back
and drive the truck across.

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,909
Yeah, but which one?

37
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,310
- l knew that bridge was safe.
- Come on, kid.

38
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,309
Almost there.

39
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,079
The brake, use the brake!

40
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,588
OK, back in the truck.

41
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,392
Well, it's on foot from here.
OK, Zak, take a look. Which way?.

42
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,593
- What's his problem now?.
- He says we can't go on.

43
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,236
- These woods are protected.
- Oh, yeah? Protected by who?

44
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,757
By a ghost.
'he Ghost Who Walks''.

45
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,151
l wouldn't worry about that.

46
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,272
- He's not taking us beyond this point.
- Shoot him.

47
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,869
No! We may need him.

48
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,038
To drive the truck back
across the bridge!

49
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,199
Tie him up and leave him here.
We can find our own way.

50
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,032
This is it! We're there!

51
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,959
Everybody look around.

52
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,029
Well, you look like an important fella.

53
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,712
Hey, Quill! Up here!

54
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,157
- Got it!
- Mr Drax is going to be very happy.

55
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,000
- What's so important about that thing?
- l don't know.

56
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,317
l don't like to ask Drax questions.
His answers scare me.

57
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,991
Styles!

58
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,153
- What the hell happened?
- He's dead.

59
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,796
The damn thing came alive
and choked him to death.

60
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,355
- lt's not possible!
- Tell Styles.

61
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,189
- Let's get out of here.
- What about all the other stuff?

62
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,269
- There's a lot of valuable junk in here.
- Take it all. Nobody's going to miss it.

63
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,830
Now what?

64
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,713
- Drums.
- l know that! What does it mean?

65
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,230
lt don't mean nothing.
But hurry up, just the same.

66
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,508
Devil, somebody needs us.

67
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,830
This place is really
giving me the creeps.

68
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,750
What the hell is that?

69
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,598
Shoot him!

70
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,878
- Oh, shit!
- Run!

71
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,476
No!

72
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,353
Watch him, Devil.
lf he moves, eat him.

73
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,356
- What about Breen?
- Tough luck. Forget him!

74
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,473
- Who was that guy?.
- Somebody l already killed.

75
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,797
- What?
- You heard me! l killed him years ago.

76
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,116
Guess what? He's back!

77
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,276
At least he's behind us.

78
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,279
Did l get him?

79
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,869
l don't see him.
You must have hit him.

80
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,276
So long, pal!

81
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,829
Keep the truck!

82
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,869
- Ghost Who Walks!
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,830
lt's OK, now.

84
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,512
Hold on. lt'll be all right.

85
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,515
Put them in the guardhouse.

86
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,913
- What have you got here? Poachers?
- Looters, Captain.

87
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,031
Captain, you've got a problem.

88
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,597
You've got a thing out there.
A big, strange-looking thing on a horse.

89
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,439
- With a wolf!
- Get him out of here.

90
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,639
He's been chewing
on the wrong kind of jungle growth.

91
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,229
You know what he's talking about.
We both do.

92
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,193
Not now, Weeks. l'm not in the mood.

93
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,392
'he Ghost Who Walks''.
The Phantom.

94
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,319
lt's nonsense.
According to legend, he's immortal.

95
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,080
He's been around for four centuries.

96
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,231
lmagine, 400 years. lt isn't possible.

97
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,874
Ouch!

98
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,877
- Did that sting?
- Yes.

99
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,231
Good. That means it's working.

100
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,916
This is it.
This is what l'm looking for.

101
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,873
The Skulls of Touganda.

102
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,799
One made of gold,
one made of silver, one made of jade.

103
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,309
Are they valuable?

104
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,909
More than that, Guran.
They're dangerous.

105
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,078
Listen. 'hen placed together,
the three skulls harness an energy

106
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,034
a thousand times greater than any
force or high explosive known to man.''

107
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,356
lt's all right here in the chronicles.

108
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,313
''A long time ago, the Touganda tribe
possessed the skulls.

109
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,398
'hey knew the secret
of keeping their force contained.

110
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,876
'heir village was attacked
by pirates of the Sengh Brotherhood.

111
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,675
'he tribe was destroyed and
the skulls were separated and lost.

112
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,474
''For four centuries,
there's been no trace of them...

113
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,671
Until today.

114
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,152
You know, l'm fine!
l'm as good as new.

115
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,716
Very well, Ghost Who Walks.
Maybe later.

116
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,672
Yeah, maybe...

117
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,674
l used to come here myself, Kit.

118
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,192
l would consult the chronicles
for guidance and wisdom.

119
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,278
Usually when l was troubled
or confused,

120
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,278
or had just screwed up real bad.

121
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,998
l'm guilty on all counts, Dad.
l let that skull slip through my fingers.

122
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,432
Don't be too hard on yourself.
We all make mistakes.

123
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,950
- This one gets worse...
- How so?

124
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,994
lt was the Sengh Brotherhood.
l saw the spiderweb tattoo.

125
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,752
You turned over one of the Skulls
of Touganda to the Sengh Brotherhood?

126
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,114
They've tried to get their hands
on those skulls for 400 years!

127
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,280
They don't have all three.

128
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,869
We don't know how many they have.

129
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,676
Have you any idea what it means,
if they get control of the skulls?

130
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,509
- They'd be invincible.
- Then stop them!

131
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,712
You're the only one who can.

132
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,348
Excuse me, Ghost Who Walks.

133
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,712
- Yes, Guran?
- l thought l heard...

134
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,836
- Were you talking to somebody?.
- Just to myself. l was talking to myself.

135
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,597
l beg your pardon,
you can't park there!

136
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,315
Oh, Miss Palmer.
l didn't realise. l'm very sorry.

137
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,637
Forget it. l'd throw me out, too,
if l didn't know better.

138
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,229
Welcome back, Miss Palmer.

139
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,955
- Let me help you with those things.
- Thank you.

140
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,279
Oh, Diana!

141
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,471
Mother!

142
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,519
- You look absolutely stunning.
- Your timing couldn't be worse.

143
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,598
- But how are you, sweetheart?
- Lily, you look marvellous.

144
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,473
- l've contracted malaria, Mother.
- That's nice!

145
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,274
- Diana!
- Uncle Dave!

146
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,040
- Sorry, l didn't realise it was a party.
- lt's nothing.

147
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,550
Just a Palmer Foundation dinner.
l'm much happier to see you.

148
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,194
- How was the Yukon?
- Dave, it's cold.

149
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,678
What more do you want to know?.
Well, why don't you freshen up?

150
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,715
- l'll get something to eat.
- Jimmy Wells would love to see you.

151
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,153
Hello, Xander.

152
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,557
Lily, why is Xander Drax here?

153
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,797
He made a very large contribution
to the Foundation.

154
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,992
- Return it.
- But he's a respected businessman.

155
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,589
No, Lily, he's a thug.

156
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,518
Hi, Mr Drax.

157
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,518
l had the strangest urge
a few weeks ago!

158
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,429
l wanted to charter a plane,
track you down in the frozen north,

159
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,598
charge into your tent, hut or log cabin,

160
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,951
sweep you off your feet,
and bring you back to New York.

161
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,628
Really, Jimmy?. Why didn't you?

162
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,559
After a few sets of tennis
and a cold Gin Fizz,

163
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,399
the urge just seemed to pass.

164
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,229
You're pretty
in those woodsy flannels.

165
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,748
You have to admit, Diana...
There's magic there.

166
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,671
What's in the sandwich?

167
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,199
Baloney.

168
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,073
Mayor, Commissioner.
Enjoying yourselves?

169
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,989
- As much as l can in this monkey suit.
- Wonderful. You've outdone yourself.

170
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,918
- Thank you, Mayor.
- Excuse me.

171
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,908
- Here's the man l want to see.
- You're not welcome here, Mr Drax.

172
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,998
The Police Commissioner is right here.
Have me arrested!

173
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,316
Sample the canapés on your way out.

174
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,799
- For God's sake, that's not necessary.
- That's all right, l can speak for myself.

175
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,073
Tell me, your reporters are poking
their noses into my personal affairs...

176
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,589
l don't understand why. Do you?

177
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,315
Yes. And you will,
when we publish our story.

178
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,114
Why go after me?
l'm just a private citizen.

179
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,232
You own companies
that regulate public utilities.

180
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,911
You control the trade unions,
influence interest rates and stock prices.

181
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,033
And you have involvements
with the Zephro crime family.

182
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,915
l'd say you're
a very public figure, Mr Drax.

183
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,954
l've never heard such tall tales!

184
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,277
Have you been talking to my ex-wives?

185
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,393
- How much does this newspaper cost?
- Two cents daily, five cents on Sunday.

186
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,559
No, all of it. The building,
the presses, the typewriters...

187
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,389
- Maybe l'll buy the whole damn thing.
- Not everything in life is for sale.

188
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,591
Of course it is, Dave!

189
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,395
And l'll tell you something else.
l usually get what l want.

190
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,794
Gentlemen, l have no axe to grind.
l'm only interested in the truth.

191
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,151
l've learnt something
from a source at the city library.

192
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,113
Drax has been extensively
researching esoteric volumes.

193
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,029
They are normally kept
under constant lock and key.

194
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,118
He's interested in something
connected with this symbol.

195
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,957
- What does it mean?
- He's on a quest.

196
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,311
For a supernatural power.

197
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,355
These are dangerous times. Dictators
are popping up all over the world.

198
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,791
Drax already has the desire
to become one himself.

199
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,310
- This will provide him with the means.
- That's nonsense.

200
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,717
l know it's hard to fathom,
but Drax believes in it.

201
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,753
This man must be taken seriously.

202
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,397
l've traced the origin of that symbol
to a place called the Bengalla Jungle.

203
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,319
This is a ticket for the Clipper.
You're not going there?

204
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,435
My plans were to leave tomorrow
and meet up with a Captain Horton.

205
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,475
But now... l don't know if l can turn
my back on Drax for that long.

206
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,514
- lt's just a wild goose chase, anyway.
- That's right.

207
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,518
A far-off jungle's no place for you.

208
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,712
l agree. You need to stay here
and take care of things.

209
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,037
There you go, Dave.
Listen to your niece.

210
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,197
- Let me go for you.
- l don't know, Diana...

211
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,038
l want to go.

212
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,636
You were right, Mr Drax.
They know far too much.

213
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,396
All right, l'll be there...

214
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,756
- Hey!
- Call him back.

215
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,558
Thank you, sir.

216
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,952
lt's Ray Zephro. Our little tootsie
is boarding the plane right now.

217
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,435
Say the word and
l'll drag her off by her hair.

218
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,996
Thanks, Ray, but l have
another way of dealing with this.

219
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,718
After all, l do have friends
in that part of the world.

220
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,595
l've got to go. Dr Fleming is here.

221
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,439
The librarian.

222
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,595
Dr Fleming!
Thanks so much for coming.

223
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,950
l don't mind. lt's a nice day for a walk.

224
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,118
Yes, it certainly is. Please, sit down.

225
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,276
So, how can l help you?

226
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,998
You can reassure me that my research
at the library is strictly confidential.

227
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,149
- Of course it is!
- Really?. Are you sure?

228
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,670
Dave Palmer has been
poking his nose into my business.

229
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,351
You have nothing to worry about,
Mr Drax. Your privacy is protected.

230
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,348
All requests for access
to special collections come to me.

231
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,472
l'm the only one who sees them.

232
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,273
Well, good.
l feel a whole lot better now.

233
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,273
Thanks for coming.
Oh, one more thing, if you don't mind.

234
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,472
l'd like your professional opinion
on something under this microscope.

235
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,557
Sure.

236
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,194
Here, let me hold your glasses.

237
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,516
- l don't see a thing.
- Just turn the focus knob.

238
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,559
l guess you won't be
needing these any more.

239
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,953
- Your coffee, Miss.
- Thanks.

240
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,957
Guran, l'm leaving.

241
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,871
l'm going with Zak. What are you
listening to? ''Junior G-Man''?

242
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,514
l wish it was. This is real.

243
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,955
The Pan Am Clipper has been
forced down over the ocean.

244
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,915
He'll do.

245
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,759
We want Diana Palmer.

246
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,638
We're prepared to kill all of you,
one by one, until she steps forward.

247
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,310
- No, please!
- l'm Diana Palmer.

248
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,671
So quickly. How disappointing...

249
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,430
Happy now?. Get a good look?.

250
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,072
- l'll stay on the radio, Captain.
- All right.

251
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,919
Wake me,
if there's any news.

252
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,758
Can't you ever come in
through the front door?.

253
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,509
lt's too obvious. l like the window.

254
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,955
- lt's good to see you, Phantom.
- Captain.

255
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,517
- We've had some trouble tonight.
- So l've heard. Any news?

256
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,553
The passengers were picked up
by a Portuguese fishing boat.

257
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,834
Everyone is safe, except one
young woman who was abducted.

258
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,519
Who?

259
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,234
She was on her way to see me,
oddly enough.

260
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,115
- Her name is Diana Palmer.
- Diana Palmer?.

261
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,436
From New York?.
Uncle owns the Tribune?

262
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,553
- That's right. How did you know?.
- l heard the name somewhere.

263
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,794
First those graverobbers
and now this.

264
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,470
- l only hope we can get her back.
- l'll see what l can do.

265
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,478
You'd better go out
the way you came in.

266
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,353
l have enough trouble
pretending you're not real.

267
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,871
Thanks, Zak.

268
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,957
Ghost Who Walks,
l remember they had aeroplane.

269
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,948
- Who, the bad men?
- A plane with boats for feet.

270
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,597
Boats for feet?
What, seaplanes? Seaplanes!

271
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,072
- Thanks for the help.
- Let's see her face.

272
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,998
She's sort of pretty
in a spoiled rich girl kind of way.

273
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,035
Who are you? Are you crazy?. Do you
realise how many laws you've broken?

274
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,994
Disruption of international
air transportation, abduction...

275
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,031
Piracy, kidnapping...

276
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,037
Oh! Feisty, too.

277
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,878
Shut up.

278
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,959
lf this kidnapping is about money,
you won't get one cent.

279
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,196
Not one red cent!

280
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,917
l've got to report in now.
Somebody has a big interest in you.

281
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,237
Maybe when l get back,
you and l can spend some time alone.

282
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,908
Good work, Zak.
Now go back to the Rope People.

283
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,079
Stay away from bad guys.

284
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,352
Nice boots. Expensive, huh?

285
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,118
Not really.

286
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,792
Come on, we can talk.
lt's just us girls.

287
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,197
Mind if l take a look?.

288
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,595
Quit that!

289
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,032
l was right.
Fifth Avenue, New York City!

290
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,438
Just my size, too.

291
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,148
What have we here?

292
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,557
All right, gentlemen, nobody...

293
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,800
Ladies, kindly pardon my error.

294
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,313
Don't move!

295
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,828
Oh, a love letter!

296
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,270
- What is this, a ship full of women?
- All my pilots are women.

297
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,630
lnteresting. Excuse me.

298
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,360
- Who are you?
- A good Samaritan.

299
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,597
l bet you're better than good.

300
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,713
- l'll get the chance to find out...
- There's an old jungle saying:

301
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,198
''Never point a gun at someone,
because it might go off.''

302
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,995
Fast hands!
l like that in a man.

303
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,036
Tie her up.

304
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,397
Or don't...

305
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,716
lt's personal.

306
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,279
- Let's go.
- Not so fast. Why should l go with you?

307
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,438
- Trust me, Diana.
- You know my name?

308
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,279
Sure. You're Diana Palmer.

309
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,314
Your kidnapping has been reported
to the authorities. This is a rescue!

310
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,549
Thanks, you've done a good job.
l can take it from here.

311
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,830
She's not changed a bit...

312
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,032
- What the hell is going on?
- There's a man in a purple suit here.

313
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,629
No, it can't be! Scramble the pilots!

314
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,879
Find him, stop him!
Don't let him get off the ship! Now, go!

315
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,872
- The engine room!
- l'll take the port side.

316
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,792
- l think we should stick together.
- OK.

317
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,958
We should stick together,
but l should go first.

318
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,549
Fine, go ahead. lt's your rescue.

319
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,391
Get a hold of him!

320
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,239
Get back!

321
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,319
Relax, pal! Relax!

322
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,399
Small world, huh?
How is that knife wound doing?

323
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,236
Where was it again?
Right about there?

324
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,312
Good boy, Devil.

325
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,995
- Your dog's a wolf.
- l know. Come on.

326
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,394
Easy.

327
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,870
- Come on, get in.
- You can fly a plane?

328
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,792
Of course you can. Why ask?.

329
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,039
Let's go! They're getting away!
We've got to stop them!

330
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,035
Mount up, we're going after them!

331
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,233
Hurry up, let's go!
Come on, come on!

332
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,551
Stay with us! Ride fast!

333
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,035
We're losing fuel!
We better take her down!

334
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,277
- See the pontoon?
- Yes.

335
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,118
- Climb onto it.
- What?

336
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,151
Trust me.

337
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,794
l must be crazy.

338
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,913
- Who's flying the plane?
- l jammed the stick.

339
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,395
There's not much time.
The clearing's short.

340
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,989
- Get ready.
- Get ready?.

341
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,392
- You can't!
- We have to.

342
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,028
OK, jump!

343
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,558
- l can't believe we just did that.
- Neither can l.

344
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,673
Swing around behind me.

345
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,433
What's the matter with you?
Can't you hit anything?

346
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,156
Come on, step on it! Faster!

347
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,076
Catch them!
Don't let them escape! Go, go!

348
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,717
We can't outrun them
doubled up like this.

349
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,832
Don't worry,
l've got friends in these woods.

350
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,999
- How did you do that?
- My friends, the Rope People.

351
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,989
- Are you OK?.
- l just feel a little dizzy.

352
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,838
lt must be the humidity.

353
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,354
- Wait here one second?
- OK.

354
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,593
l want to give you something
to remember me by.

355
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,870
l don't think that's a problem.

356
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,958
Well, you won't find these in New York.

357
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,551
Black pearls. They're beautiful!

358
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,676
They were a gift to an ancestor
by a grateful Arabian prince.

359
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,952
- l want you to have them.
- Thank you.

360
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,993
Oh, no! Not the old pearl ploy again.

361
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,998
That's what passes for humour
in the jungle, Diana.

362
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,998
Captain Horton, Diana Palmer.

363
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,316
Thank God you're all right Diana.

364
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,957
- How did you manage to get her away?.
- Diana did all the work, actually.

365
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,913
Not only is he mysterious,
he's modest, too.

366
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,669
Old jungle saying:
''Phantom is many men.''

367
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,190
No smoking in the Skull Cave.

368
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,358
Sorry, l forgot.

369
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,156
l received your uncle's wire. What's
so important as to bring you here?

370
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,474
Can you identify this symbol?

371
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,919
You'd better have a look.

372
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,438
Well, somebody say something.

373
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,871
We're all mixed-up
with the Sengh Brotherhood.

374
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,719
- The what?
- Sengh Brotherhood.

375
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,559
An ancient order of evil.
They started out as pirates.

376
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,479
Nowadays, there's no telling
what they've become.

377
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,672
- Where did you get this?
- New York.

378
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,952
My uncle's newspaper
is investigating Xander Drax.

379
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,549
He's crazy, power-mad.

380
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,231
Take her back. Use every man
at your disposal and give her protection.

381
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,954
Wait!
You're going to send me away?.

382
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,718
l'm afraid so.

383
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,037
l came here to do a job,
and that's what l'm going to do.

384
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,038
There's a lot more l need to know.

385
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,639
Goodbye.

386
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,758
- Wait a second!
- Diana...

387
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,598
- Nobody argues with the Phantom and wins.
- Old jungle saying.

388
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,795
Oh, baby...

389
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,310
Oh, it is beautiful!

390
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,229
l used a little toothpaste on it.
lt polished up so good.

391
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,114
Toothpaste? Really?.

392
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,151
That's nice.

393
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,075
You know,
l am in such a good mood right now.

394
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,431
l almost hate to mention this.

395
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,995
The happy home-coming!

396
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,034
Kind of brings a tear to the eye,
doesn't it? What went wrong?

397
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,318
- Something you didn't count on.
- Oh? Really?.

398
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,798
- And what was that?
- The Phantom.

399
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,278
- l thought that was a superstition.
- Oh, no. He's real.

400
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,553
And he won't die. l know,
l killed him once and he isn't dead.

401
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,754
- That doesn't make sense.
- Look, l brought this to prove it.

402
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,118
See this hole? That's where
l stuck him with a 12-inch blade.

403
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,517
You stabbed him in the back?.
l've underestimated you, Quill.

404
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,917
- Right up to the hilt.
- That should've done the trick.

405
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,432
The Phantom helped Diana to escape.
l think he's in love with her.

406
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,757
This is getting more interesting.
Why do you say that?

407
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,238
Because he could have had me...
but he picked her.

408
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,958
- That could only be love.
- Or simply bad judgement.

409
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,075
- So, what should we do about him?
- Do? Nothing.

410
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,673
This is New York. l'm not concerned
with some jungle hero half a world away.

411
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,356
Here. Keep the change.

412
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,788
Hey!

413
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,189
Not so fast, buddy-boy.
This isn't real money.

414
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,630
You're right, that's Bengalla currency.

415
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,513
Coin of the realm
would be appreciated.

416
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,076
- l'm afraid that's all l've got.
- lt'd better not be.

417
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,034
All right, here...

418
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,196
Where is it?

419
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,190
These are opals.

420
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,040
And that's...

421
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,630
..a star sapphire.

422
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,355
Take all of them.
Don't worry, they're real.

423
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,233
They'll secure your services
for the rest of the day, so wait here.

424
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,793
- You're kidding?
- l never kid.

425
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,638
God is dead,
and darkness rules the earth.

426
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,316
America is in financial ruin.

427
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,512
Europe and Asia
are on the brink of self-annihilation.

428
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,597
Chaos reigns.

429
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,158
But like l've always said,
there is opportunity in chaos.

430
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,478
And so, my brothers,
l give you...

431
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,989
..the Skull of Touganda.

432
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,479
This skull is one of three.
When all three skulls are united,

433
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,913
they will produce a force
more powerful than any army on earth.

434
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,396
You've only got the one!

435
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,868
Legend has it
that if the skulls are separated,

436
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,719
two of the skulls
will point the way to the third.

437
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,673
- Like l said, you've only got...
- Raymond, Raymond...

438
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,510
Ray, l know the location
of the second skull, OK?.

439
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,195
The symbol of the Sengh Brotherhood.
We shall succeed where they've failed.

440
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,110
The skulls will be ours, and
all of the power that comes with them.

441
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,272
Count me out. This is wrong.

442
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,156
Skulls? Forces of darkness?
This isn't right.

443
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,193
l was an altar boy at Saint Timothy's.

444
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,837
So were you, Charlie. This isn't right,
we weren't raised this way.

445
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,996
Sit down, Ray.

446
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,237
The only power l believe in
comes out of the barrel of a gun.

447
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,557
Not from some jungle souvenirs!

448
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,637
Come on, Charlie.

449
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,116
You're on your own, Ray.

450
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,875
- What?
- You're on your own.

451
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,357
Fine. Suit yourself.

452
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,958
But l'm gone, Drax.
l'm taking my entire syndicate with me.

453
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,276
OK, if that's how you feel about it.

454
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,992
My bursitis is really flaring up again.

455
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,913
Charlie, you're the new boss of bosses.

456
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,476
- Think you can handle it?
- l've been waiting all my life.

457
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,033
Good man.

458
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,038
Plans have been set for tonight.

459
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,674
We'll go in and get the item
while the building is closed.

460
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,078
No, l can't wait that long.
This is too exciting! We go in now.

461
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,397
- Now, in the middle of the afternoon?
- Yes!

462
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,720
l would appreciate it if you'd
keep the police away until l'm done.

463
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,198
Hey, there! Found you.

464
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,914
Page One Girl
back from the escapade in the jungle.

465
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,680
- Why are you here?
- l was in town on business...

466
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,711
- Business?
- l was having some suits made.

467
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,559
- That's not business!
- lt is for the guy making the suit.

468
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,991
Why do you have to be difficult?
Let's have dinner and catch a show.

469
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,069
- Can l take a rain check?.
- Sure. Add it to your collection.

470
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,115
Diana, l have a surprise for you.
Come into my office.

471
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,350
- Kit!
- Hello, Diana.

472
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,949
lt's been a while, hasn't it?

473
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,391
- A few years, at least.
- Six to be exact.

474
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,397
l read about what happened.
Are you OK?.

475
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,878
l'm fine. lt started out bad,
but it all turned out OK.

476
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,197
- By the by, Jimmy Wells.
- Hi. Kit Walker.

477
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,234
So tell me, Kit,
where do you know our Diana from?

478
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,795
We were friends at college.

479
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,309
l see.

480
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,752
- Are you living here in New York?.
- No, l'm just passing through.

481
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,520
l'm catching up on old times
with Uncle Dave here.

482
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:03,033
- Yes. Trading information about Drax.
- What do you know about Drax?.

483
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,394
He's come across a rare artefact
connected to the Sengh Brotherhood.

484
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,593
lt's an old silver skull
with precious stones for the eyes.

485
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,998
- l've seen something like that before.
- You have?

486
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,033
Yes, but it wasn't silver,
l think it was green.

487
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,073
Green... Jade, perhaps.

488
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,751
l mean, where did you see it?

489
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,714
Let me see.
lt was my twelfth birthday party.

490
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,798
Mum and Dad had rented a big room.

491
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,470
Now l remember.
The Museum of World History.

492
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,719
- Yes, sir. At your service.
- You're in a good mood.

493
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,549
You bet. While you were inside,
l had those stones appraised.

494
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,638
- You can call me Al.
- Kit Walker.

495
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,478
- l'm going with you.
- Diana...

496
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,116
- Where to now, sir?.
- The Museum of World History.

497
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,754
You heard the lady.

498
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,237
You look great, Diana.
You've not changed a blt.

499
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,954
You just vanished, Kit.

500
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,355
l guess l did.

501
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,518
Not a word, not a letter.
Not even a phone call.

502
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,314
- l know.
- Why?.

503
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,954
l had to go home.

504
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,480
- My father died rather suddenly.
- l'm sorry.

505
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,274
l never heard from you again.

506
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,359
l had to take over the family business.

507
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,076
lt's hard to explain, but l've thought
a lot about you since then, Diana.

508
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,596
l've thought about you too, Kit.
Then l stopped and went on with my life.

509
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,031
lt's all wrong. lt's the wrong century,
the wrong hemisphere.

510
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,518
lt's the wrong culture. The skull hasn't
been lost, just misplaced.

511
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,518
What's your interest
with Drax and these skulls?

512
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,439
l represent their true owners.
l want to see them returned.

513
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,350
Drax wants them for himself. l can't let
Drax get his hands on this skull.

514
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,279
l've got to get it out of here.

515
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,392
Uncle Dave knows an important
member on the board of directors.

516
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,319
lt may take a day or two, but...

517
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,519
Or we could just break the glass.

518
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,519
l'll take that, thank you.

519
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,272
Museum security.
Everything's under control.

520
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:02,110
Free cake and sandwiches
are served in the Hall of Nature.

521
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,312
Bring the little ones.
Don't miss out. Thank you.

522
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,919
Bye-bye.

523
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,398
- Who are you?
- A collector like yourself, Mr Drax.

524
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,029
Drax, what's with the bag?

525
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,513
Something's happening!

526
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,750
This is it!
lt's happening right here and now!

527
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,639
Unbelievable!

528
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,038
lt's beautiful! lt's magnificent!

529
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,119
Show me the power!
Show me the power!

530
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,676
Yes!

531
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,029
Amazing!

532
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,269
Amazing!

533
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,315
l love this!

534
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,108
Wow!

535
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,711
The skulls have spoken.

536
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,353
All right, what's your name?
Why do you want that skull so badly?.

537
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,551
Kit Walker.

538
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,557
- And who is Kit Walker?.
- l am.

539
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,309
- And the skull?
- lt'd go well with my drapes.

540
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,875
Cute. You're very cute, Mr Walker.

541
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,275
Fortunately, l have a cure for that.

542
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,833
Stop it! Don't hurt him!

543
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,157
Diana, are you sweet on Mr Walker?.

544
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,238
l thought that your true love
was swinging around in the jungle.

545
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,479
How did you...?
l mean, who told you that?

546
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,908
l did!

547
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,953
Sala's got all the latest gossip
on two continents.

548
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,233
Deny it. He's in love with you,
and you're nuts about him.

549
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,115
From the moment he came flying down
that laundry chute, you were hooked.

550
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,356
''Kismet in the jungle.''

551
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,916
You're despicable.
You're just jealous.

552
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,038
- Now l'm one up on you.
- Ladies...

553
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,997
Quill, show Mr Walker up to
the observation deck and make him talk.

554
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,835
l claim the body, when you're done.

555
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,837
Now...

556
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,310
Once l check these coordinates
we'll know the location of the third skull.

557
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,919
Get up. Follow me.

558
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,752
- Well, l'll be damned.
- What?

559
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:00,556
The Devil's Vortex.
We are going to the Devil's Vortex.

560
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,149
Are you sure? Check again,
maybe you've made a mistake.

561
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,793
No, no mistake.

562
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,595
lsn't that the place
where ships disappear?.

563
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,836
Yes! lncredible, isn't it?

564
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,316
There must be an island there.
An uncharted island.

565
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,637
Maybe my brother was right
about all that stuff.

566
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:23,198
Nonsense! Come on, Charlie.
This is the chance of a lifetime.

567
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,356
Where's your spirit of adventure?

568
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,593
Mr Drax, l've made all the arrangements.
You're getting a full police escort.

569
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,032
Excellent. Have you heard the news?
We're going to the Devil's Vortex.

570
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,993
The Phantom's in the building.
l saw him with my own eyes.

571
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,113
Tell your officers there's a madman here.
He's armed and dangerous.

572
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,198
- Shoot on sight.
- Don't worry, l'll take care of it.

573
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,072
- And the girl?
- Bring her.

574
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,999
She's our Phantom insurance.

575
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,833
Get me Security.

576
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,674
We're all ready here, sir.

577
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,470
Pardon me.

578
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,558
Look out!

579
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,357
- Follow that car.
- Take my money, but don't hurt me.

580
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,074
l'm a friend of Kit Walker's.
l need your help.

581
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,278
Hey! Hey, you! Come back here!

582
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,834
Hey!

583
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,310
- What's back there?
- The zoo.

584
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,716
This is where
he would have entered.

585
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,792
He sure as hell isn't around here.
Let's keep looking.

586
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,749
Good girl.

587
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,951
Stop! Hold it right there!

588
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,593
Get in!

589
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,317
Forget him, he's not coming.

590
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,159
He's probably dead by now.

591
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,271
What is wrong with you?

592
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,835
Why are you so mean?
Don't you care about anything?

593
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,634
- Like what?
- You figure it out.

594
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:42,231
All right, everybody just shut up!
Step on it, Quill.

595
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,833
Drax is heading for the docks.
l picked it up on my police band.

596
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,510
- l thought you'd want to know.
- Thanks. Step on it, huh?

597
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,110
lt's the bottom of the ninth
and you're two skulls behind.

598
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,833
Dad, a man named Quill
has a gun belt like mine. ls it yours?

599
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,315
Yes.

600
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,990
He said he could show me
the Sengh Brotherhood stronghold.

601
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,112
He took me to a place
deep in the jungle.

602
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,711
- What happened?
- He stabbed me in the back. Literally.

603
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,117
So sue me.
l'm a lousy judge of character.

604
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,834
- Maybe l can get the gun belt back.
- lf you haven't lost him.

605
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,554
Don't worry, l'll catch him. l have to.

606
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:31,788
- There's a woman involved.
- Saints be praised! lt's about time.

607
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,958
- Tell him to step on it.
- Can you go any faster?.

608
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,879
- Are you talking to me now?.
- Yes. Can you pick it up?

609
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:41,152
Sure. Hold on to your hat.
Or whatever.

610
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,753
Looks like l've got a plane to catch.

611
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,119
Thanks.

612
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,869
Hey, pal! Give my best to Mr Walker.

613
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,232
l love New York.

614
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,396
We're getting close. We're almost there.

615
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,313
- What's that?
- Where?

616
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,873
1 1 o'clock.

617
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,958
That's it.
There is an island!

618
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,878
Take her down.

619
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,912
We're so close now. l can feel it.

620
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,351
History is about to be made,
and you're all a part of it.

621
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,870
An unequal part, of course,
but an important part, nonetheless.

622
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,719
- This one is mine.
- ln your dreams.

623
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:28,672
- Take it easy! My brothers, stay calm.
- Why do you call us brothers?

624
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,678
We, too, are members of the Sengh
Brotherhood.

625
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,628
Nice going.

626
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,150
Come with us.

627
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,191
l think us girls should stick together.

628
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,350
Now let me see...

629
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,678
When was the last time
we had visitors here below the ocean,

630
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,590
deep in the bowels
of this uncharted volcanic island?

631
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,553
Never! Congratulations!

632
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,438
You pathetic doomed fools are the first.

633
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:12,395
- Who are these people?
- My name is Xander Drax.

634
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,870
- What?
- X-A-N-D-E-R D-R-A-X.

635
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,958
Xander Drax.
Begins and ends with the letter ''x''.

636
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,196
From New York City.

637
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,632
And you, sir?. As long as we're making
polite introductions and chit-chat.

638
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,834
- Who might you be?
- He is the Great Kabai Sengh.

639
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,395
Leader of the Sengh Brotherhood.

640
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:41,469
Direct descendant of
the Evil Kabai Sengh...

641
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,558
..first leader of the Sengh Brotherhood.

642
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,759
You're a long way from New York City.
What brings you to this place?

643
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,438
These brought me here.

644
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,790
The Skulls of Touganda.

645
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,117
And what do you know
of such matters?

646
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,074
l know all about these skulls
and the power they contain.

647
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,511
Once all three are united...

648
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,314
The two l hold...

649
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,632
..and the one you have there.

650
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,593
Look, O Great One.

651
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,917
l really wasn't in the market
for a partner,

652
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,157
but we have
a mutually beneficial situation here.

653
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,793
Think of it this way.

654
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,788
You represent the old guard of grizzled
scallywags and Peg-leg Petes.

655
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,798
l stand for the new order of things,
modern and up-to-date.

656
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,594
Just the man to carry our cause
into the 20th century.

657
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,074
Silence!

658
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:50,068
You have no bargaining power
with me, Mr New York City.

659
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,716
l could kill you and
feed your pink ass to the sharks.

660
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,599
Besides...
you don't have the fourth skull.

661
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,837
What fourth skull?
What are you talking about?

662
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,712
There is no fourth skull.

663
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,549
The fourth skull controls
the power of the other three.

664
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:16,757
Without it, you've wasted your time
and your meaningless New York lives.

665
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,150
Wait a minute!

666
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,874
Anything happens to us,
others will come looking.

667
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,437
They know where we are.
You'll have an army down your throats.

668
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,471
Do you want that to happen?

669
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:36,595
No, that's bullshit!
Nobody knows where we are!

670
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,593
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

671
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,156
Spirit of adventure, my ass.
lt's every man for himself.

672
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:49,993
OK, Kabie. You get me out of here
or else you sleep with the fishes.

673
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,634
What are you going to say about that?

674
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,109
What's that supposed to mean?

675
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:03,313
Just ancient pirate talk for
''Fire the cannon''.

676
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,430
Great Kabai Sengh,
l'm Quill, a loyal follower and soldier.

677
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:30,036
Look, l once killed the Phantom.

678
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:33,471
Join the club. Many of us
have killed him over the years.

679
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,990
But he keeps coming back.

680
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:41,318
Hey! l can see that this Phantom thing
really strikes a nerve.

681
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,116
ln that case, you're going to love this.
She is his girlfriend!

682
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,390
Bring her here.

683
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,914
Think of the opportunities this presents.

684
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,317
Ransom, bait, revenge!

685
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,279
The Phantom has good taste.

686
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,552
Good! Personal pleasure,
l overlooked that one.

687
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,955
So, what do you say?.

688
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,674
The girl for the skull
and l'm out of your hair.

689
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,111
- You pirates need to get out more.
- Kabai Sengh!

690
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,150
Phantom!

691
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,353
Let's get him!

692
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,834
Run away!

693
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,997
Ghost Who Walks,
l'll cut you off at your knee!

694
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,232
You're not immortal.

695
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:40,115
l know your secrets, Phantom.

696
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,118
Take them to your grave, Kabai Sengh.

697
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,354
Sala! Cut the rope!

698
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,551
- Torpedoes.
- This explains all those missing ships.

699
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,558
You and Sala can escape in here.
l'll shoot you to the surface.

700
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,399
Those are like warheads.
lf we hit anything, we're fish food.

701
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,558
We'll use the periscope
to make sure the path is clear.

702
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,557
Come on.

703
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,753
- How are you going to get out?
- l'll be right behind you.

704
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,792
At last.

705
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,798
l've already killed you.

706
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,072
No, you killed my father!

707
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,032
You've got something
that belongs to me.

708
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,468
No.

709
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,589
- Drax, over here!
- What is it?

710
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,715
These skulls are more powerful
than l imagined!

711
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:26,072
l've harnessed the energy of the sun!
Who needs a fourth skull?

712
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,953
l do. And l know where it is.

713
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,553
l've worn it all my life. For protection.

714
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,833
l've never understood
what that meant until right now.

715
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,958
What a cheap jungle trick!

716
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,115
Unbelievable!

717
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,792
- End of the line.
- We made it!

718
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,470
lt all began 400 years ago,

719
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:44,798
when a boy saw his father murdered
by pirates of the Sengh Brotherhood.

720
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,833
That same boy
swore an oath of vengeance.

721
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:51,589
He would fight piracy,
greed and cruelty in all its forms.

722
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,314
He became the first Phantom.

723
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:01,670
l'm his descendant, Diana,
sworn to carry out his oath.

724
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:06,670
The mantle of the Phantom
was passed on from father to son.

725
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:11,158
Twenty Phantoms came before me,
but no one knew that.

726
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:15,592
They thought he was the same Phantom
and that he was immortal.

727
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,268
That's why they called him
'he Ghost Who Walks''.

728
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,040
l'm not immortal, Diana.

729
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:25,438
l was born right here in this cave
and educated in America.

730
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:31,078
When my father was killed,
l came back to take his place.

731
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,511
And one day,
your own son will take your place.

732
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,631
Yes.

733
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,236
The plane for Miss Palmer is waiting,
Ghost Who Walks.

734
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,668
Thank you, Guran.

735
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:58,358
- Does Guran know the truth?
- Oh, sure. He just likes to call me that.

736
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,550
Goodbye, Devil.
Take good care of your master.

737
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,070
l'd better go.

738
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,439
Hey, Kit.

739
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,269
- l like her.
- Thanks, Dad.

740
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,233
Well, get going!

741
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,954
Before l go...
take off your mask.

742
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,071
Let me see your face.

743
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,916
Kit.

744
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:27,195
l'm not really permitted
to reveal all of my secrets, Diana.

745
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,834
You're not?

746
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,709
Actually l am,
but only to one person.

747
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,673
- Who's that?
- The woman l intend to marry.

748
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:44,396
- What if she refuses you?
- No one refuses the Phantom.

749
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,118
Goodbye.

750
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,789
Leave lt to my son to let the perfect
woman slip through his ingers.

751
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,514
Fortunately,
Diana knew her own mind.

752
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:38,111
She vowed to herself that she would
soon return to the Bengalla Jungle.

753
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:42,154
Maybe then l can get some rest.

754
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,036
ENGLlSH
