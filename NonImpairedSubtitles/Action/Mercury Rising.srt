1
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:16,584
Let's go down.

2
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:31,067
- You got some out. How many left?
- Three out, eight left.

3
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:34,430
- Edgar's still the man?
- Edgar's the man.

4
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,392
Edgar, I want to thank you
for letting these people go.

5
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:41,222
Send out the others, and we can come
to a peaceful resolution.

6
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:45,062
Get this straight. I don't trust you or
any agent of your occupation government.

7
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:46,991
Listen to me
one more time.

8
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:50,231
I have an order from the Citizens' Court
of South Dakota...

9
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,782
to seize the ill-gotten assets
of this bank.

10
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:56,583
Move your people away from here or
these bloodsuckers will burn in hell!

11
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:06,031
They're gettin' ready
to come in.

12
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,503
Let them come.

13
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:10,983
- I have to go home.
- Get down!

14
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:13,269
Please, let me go home.
Please, let me go home.

15
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,426
- Get the fuck down!
- I just need to go home.

16
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:19,074
When he says "get down,"
just do it!

17
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:30,784
Damn!

18
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:40,705
I sure don't feel good.

19
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:44,144
You said we were gonna be in and out of
here before anybody knew what hit 'em.

20
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:47,306
You said they were
gonna back down.

21
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,346
They ain't backin' down, Edgar.

22
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,783
They got an army
out there.

23
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:54,910
They're gonna come in here
and shoot all of us.

24
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,064
God just wants His miracle
to be greater.

25
00:04:57,114 --> 00:05:00,504
God doesn't want your boys
to get killed, Edgar!

26
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:11,907
We need more time,
you sons of bitches!

27
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:14,024
You ain't in charge here.
So shut up!

28
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:15,985
- They cut us off.
- We gotta go in.

29
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:19,623
- We have a man in there.
He wants more time.
- Right.

30
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:23,468
Undercover agent who isn't supposed
to be there in the first place.

31
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:26,114
- We're goin' in.
- Let me try 'em on the bullhorn.

32
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:28,105
- If they come back to me--
- You've got three minutes.

33
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,385
This is Agent Blackwell,
Edgar.

34
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:38,673
I need you to pick up
the telephone.

35
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:42,827
- I need to talk with you.
- We can still walk out of here.

36
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:45,342
You just gotta
stand up to him.

37
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:51,712
Just tell him you wanna go home.
Can you do it?

38
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:56,151
Edgar, please pick up
the phone. We can still work this out.

39
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:06,269
Edgar, please pick up
the phone. We were doing well before.

40
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,185
Sir?

41
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:10,390
Peter's right.

42
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:14,228
It's not like you said
it was going to be.

43
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:18,425
I wanna go home.

44
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:35,388
Edgar,
the boy's right.

45
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:37,385
- Traitor.
- Daddy.
- Shut up, lsaac.

46
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,948
- Let me call 'em on the telephone.
- We don't need him.

47
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:42,502
- We can still walk out of here.
- Do it, Edgar!

48
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:45,148
For your boys, do it!

49
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:58,190
Get down! Get down!

50
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:03,544
F.B.I.!
Get on the ground.

51
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:14,904
Go, go, go!

52
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:16,825
Daddy!

53
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,106
Stay down!
Don't move.

54
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:24,506
- Don't move, goddamn it!
- I'm F.B.I. F.B.I.!
Get off me, asshole!

55
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:27,427
- Tell your men to hold their fire.
- Peter.

56
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:29,783
- Peter.
- James?

57
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:32,752
James, keep your head down!
Where are you?

58
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:35,627
- Peter!
- No! No! No!

59
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:39,030
Hold your fire!
No! No!

60
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:41,952
Damn it!

61
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:47,467
Goddamn it!

62
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:49,391
Shoot! Shoot!

63
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:54,747
Get a med tech in here!
Get a med tech in here, goddamn it!

64
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,029
Don't talk.
Don't talk.

65
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:59,463
Come on now, goddamn it!

66
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:01,909
Get a med tech in here!

67
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:07,632
He's dead.

68
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:17,391
Who said "go"?

69
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:21,072
Who's the S.A.C.?

70
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:23,952
Hartley.

71
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,351
Hartley!

72
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:33,632
Special Agent Hartley!

73
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,592
Hartley! Did you hear me ask
for more time?

74
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:39,831
- Get your hands off me.
- Did you hear me ask for more time?

75
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:42,747
- You're out of line, Jeffries.
- I'm out of line? I'm out of line?

76
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:47,703
Did I just massacre
five fuckin' people? Huh? Did l?

77
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:52,470
Three seconds, Hartley,
I was gonna walk 'em all out alive.

78
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:54,272
Massacre.

79
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:56,822
They were just kids.

80
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:00,871
Just kids.

81
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:05,789
I report to Washington
just like you do, Jeffries.

82
00:09:57,434 --> 00:10:01,393
Right on Western.
Left on Belmont.

83
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:04,272
- Hey, Simon, I have a surprise for you.
- Right on Halsted.

84
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,427
- Left on Fullerton.
- You're giving some good directions.

85
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:12,109
Look. I have something
very, very special.

86
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,106
You like these puzzles,
don't ya?

87
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:18,305
Uh-huh. Okay,
but not yet, Simon.

88
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:22,666
If I give you the puzzle book,
I want you to join in with
the rest of the class, okay?

89
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:33,191
That's great.

90
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:35,987
It's time to join
the group now, okay?

91
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:43,025
Good morning, Simon.

92
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:44,991
Good morning, teacher.

93
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:47,634
Look at me.

94
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,788
Good morning, teacher.

95
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:12,345
I better not beat you.
I only accept cash.

96
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,743
- How are you?
- Well, another day at the office.

97
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:27,433
- You ready?
- Yeah.

98
00:11:27,474 --> 00:11:30,227
All right,
let's talk about it.

99
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,988
Agent Jeffries here
to see you, Chief.

100
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:46,662
The psychologist wrote
"delusional paranoia"...

101
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:49,712
in capital letters
across the bottom of your file.

102
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:53,872
- So, am I fired?
- No, you're not fired.

103
00:11:56,354 --> 00:12:00,063
- But I can't put you undercover
anymore. That's over.
- What do they expect me to do?

104
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:03,504
- To do your job.
- I work undercover. That's my job.

105
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:06,506
- You have a new job now.
- And what is that?

106
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:09,864
Sitting on a wire,
stakeouts, log tapes.

107
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:12,382
- A little public relations.
- Fourteen years on the job,
and that's all it means?

108
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:15,426
I've gotta sit
on a wire with some rookie listening
to a housewife order groceries?

109
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:18,193
- All you had to do
was keep your mouth shut.
- All I did was tell the truth.

110
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:21,232
- Act like you belong on the
same team as the rest of us.
- What team?

111
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:24,112
That bunch of suits sitting behind a
desk trying to justify their existence?

112
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:27,305
- Like me. Is that what you're saying?
- I don't know, Joe.

113
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:30,232
- Why didn't you say one thing
to back me up?
- Because you were wrong!

114
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:32,623
- I wasn't wrong!
- You were dead wrong.

115
00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:35,706
Two teenage kids in cold blood,
and you know it.

116
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:39,070
- They were goddamn bank robbers,
for Christ's sake!
- They were kids.

117
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:41,907
Will you forget
about South Dakota?

118
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:45,066
Forget who's right and who's wrong.
This is one of the best undercover guys.

119
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,589
How could I forget that?

120
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,825
Sit down, Art.

121
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:06,346
Sometimes...
you got somethin'.

122
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:10,432
It's... magic.

123
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:14,185
Then it goes away.

124
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:16,111
You had it.

125
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:19,464
But the magic's gone.

126
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:25,386
They told you to break my balls,
and see if you could get me to quit.

127
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:27,504
I'm not gonna make it easy
for you.

128
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:31,109
You want me to sit on a wire,
I'll do it.

129
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:34,669
You want me to chase
file applicants, I'll do that.

130
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,591
Take your best shot.

131
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:39,307
Check your mailbox
for your new assignments.

132
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:02,668
Hey, Simon, we're here.

133
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:30,704
Mommy, Simon is home.

134
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:33,388
Look at me.

135
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:35,305
Hi, Mom.

136
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:38,426
Hi, honey. I missed you.
Come on inside.

137
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:22,394
Be careful.

138
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:24,271
It's very hot.

139
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,464
Sip it slowly.

140
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,385
Daddy'll be home soon.

141
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:34,069
And when you finish that,
you can wait for him up in your room.

142
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:20,673
Congratulations.
You've reached the Puzzle Center.

143
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:22,585
For solving one
of our master puzzles...

144
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,472
you've won a subscription
to the magazine of your choice.

145
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:27,465
Can I please have your name,
address and telephone number?

146
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:29,624
You are...

147
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,670
a stranger.

148
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:36,908
Excuse me. This the Puzzle Center.
Where did you get this number?

149
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:40,873
Puzzle nine-nine.

150
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:43,144
What did you just say?
Who is this?

151
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,065
Simon,
put down the phone.

152
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:47,469
Simon, Simon, wait a second.
Please don't hang--

153
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:58,149
Come on, come on.

154
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:01,153
Figures.

155
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:03,065
See if they correlate.

156
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:06,544
If they don't, you may have lost some
bytes in the transfer, lost a keyword.

157
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:09,751
You won't be able
to defractionate. Yeah?

158
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,950
- Are you scrambled?
- Give me a break, Leo. I'm busy.

159
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:15,066
It's Mercury, Dean. Somebody just walked
on water. You have to get up here now.

160
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:26,386
- What did you just say?
- You are a stranger.

161
00:18:26,474 --> 00:18:29,671
- Who is this?
- Simon, put down the phone.

162
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:32,990
Simon, Simon, wait a second.
Please don't hang--

163
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:35,911
Who is that?

164
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:39,629
Listen to the timbre
of his voice.

165
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:43,263
It's a child.
That had to be his mother.

166
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:45,225
Right. It's just
some rug rat...

167
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:48,346
drooling over the phone,
punching numbers, like a random thing.

168
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:50,265
Huh?

169
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,350
We're not that lucky.

170
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:58,868
- We have to call Kudrow.
- What? Dean, what?

171
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:01,184
No, no, no.
We don't have to call anybody.

172
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:04,829
All we gotta do is an analysis,
and give him a report when he gets back.

173
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:08,111
- That's it!
- Do you understand what just happened?

174
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:11,789
We have to call him now
or he's gonna say we tried to hide it.

175
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:23,627
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Marine.

176
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:27,150
I've got an urgent message
for Lieutenant Colonel Kudrow.

177
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:30,630
Mercury is already
operational in most of our com centers.

178
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:33,632
And I'm here to confirm
everything you've already heard.

179
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,548
Mercury is a quantum leap
in our communications security.

180
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,626
And once we complete its installation
in all of our com centers...

181
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,786
- it's going to be very hard
for our adversaries--
- And our allies.

182
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:48,510
And our allies to compromise
our communications.

183
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:51,062
An urgent message
for you, sir.

184
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:58,545
If you'll excuse me.

185
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:02,752
-Mr. Johnson will continue the briefing.
-All right, gentlemen.

186
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:19,865
Impossible.

187
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:08,503
- You're late.
- I wasn't when I started.

188
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:11,949
Traffic was like mud.

189
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:13,871
I oozed home.

190
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:20,591
I told Simon
he could wait up for you.

191
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:22,590
Simon, my man.

192
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:31,669
I wonder where Simon is.

193
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:39,188
Time for bed, Simon.

194
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:13,946
-Send in Pedranski and Crandell, please.
- Yes, sir.

195
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,989
Who needs a fix?
Double tall, double dark, double sweet.

196
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:34,827
Double everything. I'm so glad I missed
the whole drug thing...

197
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:37,627
so my body was virgin territory
for caffeine.

198
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:42,026
It makes me feel so Ricki Lake,
like I can talk to anybody.

199
00:23:42,074 --> 00:23:46,352
What can I say? I'm the Java Queen.
What's wrong?

200
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:49,225
Kudrow wants to see me.

201
00:23:49,314 --> 00:23:53,102
Cool! Maybe you'll get
your own section.

202
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:55,071
No. I, uh,
I screwed up.

203
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:58,351
Well, just go in there
and throw him a Bart Simpson.

204
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:00,271
Kudrow, dude, chill out.

205
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:02,993
- It was that way when I got there.
- Doh!

206
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:11,544
Puzzle line?

207
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:14,102
Puzzle line?

208
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:17,027
Now, I've traveled 10,000 miles
in the past 24 hours.

209
00:24:17,074 --> 00:24:19,952
So I've had a lot of time to reflect
on this. Correct me if I'm wrong.

210
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:25,062
But I believe neither one of you has
ever said the words "puzzle line" to me.

211
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:30,826
Before Mercury went operational,
we ran a standard validation protocol.

212
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:33,064
The works. Double sets of paired
Cray supercomputers...

213
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:36,430
fricking velociraptor machines
chewing at Mercury 24 hours a day.

214
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,032
Mercury came out unbent.

215
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:41,066
Awesome, sir. It was finally a code
that couldn't be broken.

216
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:46,069
But there was one last thing
to check out. The, um... geek factor.

217
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:49,590
Human beings will fool you sometimes.
We thought it important--

218
00:24:49,674 --> 00:24:54,304
We slipped a message
in one of those egghead word games.
We dared amateurs to crack it.

219
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:57,073
- We were sure nobody would ever call.
- But somebody did.

220
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:04,106
His name is Simon Lynch. He lives
in Chicago. He is nine years old.

221
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:07,584
And he has deciphered a message written
in the most sophisticated code...

222
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:09,750
the world has ever known...

223
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:12,906
in a geek's
puzzle magazine.

224
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:15,064
I don't recall
ever authorizing...

225
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:17,873
anyone to put any message...

226
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:19,945
into any magazine!

227
00:25:19,994 --> 00:25:24,033
That couldn't just happen.
A kid couldn't just pop it open.

228
00:25:24,114 --> 00:25:29,063
Not only is he nine years old,
he is handicapped. He is autistic.

229
00:25:29,114 --> 00:25:31,150
Yes, that explains it.

230
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:34,192
So our $2 billion code
is an open book...

231
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:36,429
- to people of diminished capacity?
- No, sir.

232
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:39,551
Autism isn't synonymous
with diminished capacity.

233
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:42,671
Autistic people are--
They're shut off.

234
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:45,672
But it's not unusual
for an autistic person to be a savant.

235
00:25:45,714 --> 00:25:48,751
- Oh, a savant!
- He may not be able
to actually decipher the code.

236
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:50,910
- It might just appear to him.
- Right. He didn't calculate anything.

237
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:54,748
He just saw it. Like those stupid
pictures at the mall. You stare at them.

238
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:57,553
- All of a sudden you're looking
at the Statue of Liberty.
- Exactly.

239
00:25:57,634 --> 00:26:00,910
This is not a stupid picture
at the mall.

240
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:03,064
This is national security.

241
00:26:05,674 --> 00:26:09,906
Looking at the best case scenario,
let's suppose the boy is unique...

242
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:12,952
and he doesn't understand
what he's just done.

243
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:16,265
Does that solve my problem?
Answer: No!

244
00:26:16,314 --> 00:26:19,351
Analysis: All we need now
is for someone else...

245
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:22,028
who understands his capability
to come along...

246
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:25,225
and my problems are increased
exponentially.

247
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:28,186
Then maybe we should talk
to the kid.

248
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:30,583
- And, uh--
- No.

249
00:26:31,954 --> 00:26:34,070
No. No.

250
00:26:36,154 --> 00:26:39,385
There must be nothing
that connects the boy to this office.

251
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,671
Nothing.
Am I clear?

252
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:44,067
Yes, sir.

253
00:26:44,114 --> 00:26:46,674
I want you to erase
the tape.

254
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:48,591
Am I clear?

255
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:51,346
Yes, sir.

256
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:57,866
- Honey, will you get that?
- Yeah, I got it.

257
00:26:58,674 --> 00:27:00,710
- Martin Lynch?
- Yeah.

258
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:02,631
Detective Burrell,
Chicago police.

259
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:05,313
Sorry to bother you. Can I ask you
a few questions? It's very important.

260
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:08,466
-I got your address from Simon's school.
-Something wrong?

261
00:27:08,554 --> 00:27:11,307
If I drag this out,
it's only gonna make things worse.

262
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:13,589
One of the other parents
has made accusations...

263
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,188
against Simon's driver
of a sexual nature.

264
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:20,347
- Oh, my God.
- Well, they're only allegations
at this point.

265
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:22,265
If I could step inside
and speak with you.

266
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:24,265
Uh, sure.

267
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,033
It won't take more
than a moment.

268
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:33,869
- I don't want to upset you.
- Well, you've already upset us.

269
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:37,390
- I'm sorry about that.
- Would you like a cup of coffee?

270
00:27:37,474 --> 00:27:39,669
- Or something?
- Yeah. Yeah, that'd be real nice.

271
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:09,183
911. Emergency operator 562.

272
00:28:11,954 --> 00:28:13,785
911. Emergency operator 562.

273
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:17,230
What are you reporting?

274
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:21,153
I have your location on my screen.
Can you tell me what you're reporting?

275
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:39,469
Anything while I was gone,
Art?

276
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:42,824
- Yeah, I think we got
a big break in this case.
- What?

277
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,145
The Attorney General herself
just called in 25 dimes on the Cubs.

278
00:29:46,194 --> 00:29:49,231
What do you think?

279
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:51,151
Uh--

280
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:56,788
- Yeah?
- This is 13.

281
00:29:56,874 --> 00:29:59,434
- Cubs ten times.
- Got it.

282
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:05,783
Dumb bet, 13.
Cubs are in a slump.

283
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:08,468
Would you mind if I told you
something personal?

284
00:30:10,754 --> 00:30:13,393
Yeah, I would, Roger.

285
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:15,311
I really would.

286
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,111
Excuse me.

287
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:22,031
Yeah?

288
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:24,030
Art, for you.

289
00:30:25,434 --> 00:30:27,311
Yeah?

290
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:30,551
We're sending someone to spell you.
We've got another assignment for you.

291
00:30:30,634 --> 00:30:33,148
Lomax has another matter
of national security for me?

292
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:35,702
Check into a possible missing child,
2-1 precinct.

293
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,625
Chicago P.D.
retains jurisdiction.

294
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:14,146
Yeah. Lacerations.

295
00:31:14,194 --> 00:31:16,071
Nichols.

296
00:31:16,114 --> 00:31:18,548
- You still alive?
- Still here, Art.

297
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:22,513
- How are ya?
- All right.

298
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:26,547
What is this?
It's supposed to be a missing kid.

299
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,706
It is.
These are the parents.

300
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:31,625
Looks like
a murder-suicide.

301
00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:34,505
So where's the kid?

302
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:37,313
Missing, remember?

303
00:31:37,394 --> 00:31:39,225
What are you
doin' here?

304
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,989
Somebody called the F.B.I.
and they sent me. Go figure.

305
00:31:43,074 --> 00:31:45,713
No, I meant,
what are you doin' here?

306
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:50,509
Workin' my way to the bottom, Jack,
just like you.

307
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:53,791
The kid's name is Simon.
Neighbors say he's retarded.

308
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:56,513
Guys who kill their families
kill all of 'em.

309
00:31:56,594 --> 00:32:00,109
Maybe he did the kid somewhere else.
Didn't want Mom to see.

310
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:03,510
Kid like that
costs a bundle.

311
00:32:03,594 --> 00:32:07,030
Maybe Dad got tired of knocking himself
out for a kid who didn't know better.

312
00:32:07,114 --> 00:32:10,186
Put 'em all out
of their misery.

313
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:13,544
How's a guy that's so broke
afford a $1500 handgun?

314
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,824
- Mind if I take a look around, Jack?
- We already did.

315
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:22,223
- The kid's not here.
- Does that mean you mind?

316
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:25,147
- Hey, be my guest.
- Thanks.

317
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,112
By the way, Lomax called.
He said it's important.

318
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,509
Yeah, I bet.
Got a phone on you?

319
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:34,025
What do you know?

320
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:37,072
- Thanks.
- Be sure I get it back.

321
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:41,429
- How are ya?
- Good.

322
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:02,545
How ya doin', champ?

323
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:04,670
You okay in there?

324
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:07,865
Come on.

325
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:10,832
You can come on out now.

326
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:12,910
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

327
00:34:15,194 --> 00:34:18,345
I'm not gonna hurt ya.
Okay?

328
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:21,551
Come on.

329
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,425
Come on.

330
00:34:26,474 --> 00:34:28,942
No, no, no, no!
Simon! All right.

331
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,025
Quiet! Quiet!

332
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:43,385
Call Concordia.

333
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:45,385
Get an ambulance
over here.

334
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:47,829
- Have some badges waiting
for us when we get there.
- For what?

335
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:51,145
- I want this kid protected.
- How am I gonna justify
the overtime?

336
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:54,914
Since when you worry
about overtime, Jack?

337
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:57,269
The coroner says
murder-suicide, they can go.

338
00:34:57,354 --> 00:35:00,744
Anybody asks about the overtime,
put it on Lomax's Gold Card.

339
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:13,708
- Straps are just makin' him worse.
- They're for his own safety.

340
00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:16,592
- Unstrap him.
- They're for his own safety.

341
00:35:16,634 --> 00:35:19,023
All right. Simon,
we're gonna unstrap you.

342
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:22,823
Take it easy. Simon, just calm down.
All right?

343
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:26,429
Mommy! Daddy!
Mommy! Daddy!

344
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:29,472
Tell him to turn that off!

345
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:31,784
Turn the siren off!

346
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:33,711
Simon, ho. Hey!

347
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:37,713
Now look. Who's this? ls that your
mommy right there? ls that your mommy?

348
00:35:37,794 --> 00:35:40,262
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Right there?

349
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:42,663
Yes, that's right.
Your mommy. That's her.

350
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:46,070
- Is that your daddy?
- Daddy.

351
00:35:46,154 --> 00:35:48,110
Right.

352
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:51,072
"Do not touch. It may be hot."
That's very good advice.

353
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:54,863
Is that your teacher?
Dr. London?

354
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:58,663
She's your friend, right?
My name is Art. I'm your friend too.

355
00:35:58,754 --> 00:36:01,666
Art is a stranger!

356
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:04,751
Art is a stranger!

357
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,553
Art is a stranger!

358
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:11,471
Okay, strap him in.

359
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:14,665
I won't hurt you.

360
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:30,184
- Hi. Are you the doctor?
- Um, no, I'm the nurse.

361
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:33,152
- Is a doctor gonna see this boy?
- Uh, I took care of him.

362
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,623
Is that the best you could do for him,
just give him a shot?

363
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:37,983
He's autistic.

364
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:40,594
- Autistic?
- Uh-huh.

365
00:36:40,674 --> 00:36:43,472
What does that mean?

366
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:45,465
Nothing gets through?

367
00:36:45,554 --> 00:36:48,990
No, it's just the opposite.
Everything gets through.

368
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:51,793
He has trouble with feelings
and emotions.

369
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,826
So he gets very frightened
and confused.

370
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:59,629
Wait. I'm not gonna be able
to question this boy?

371
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,392
Probably not.

372
00:37:01,474 --> 00:37:03,430
Sorry.

373
00:37:17,554 --> 00:37:19,385
Take care of him.

374
00:37:25,554 --> 00:37:27,829
Why are we doing this, Dean?

375
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:30,747
Why does he want to see us?
We didn't do anything wrong, right?

376
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,586
Should I turn around?

377
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:35,552
- No, he'd kill us.
- He might kill us anyway.

378
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:39,388
- Are you being serious?
- Relax, Leo, please.

379
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:55,302
Okay, I'm scared.
I'm gettin' really, really scared.

380
00:37:55,394 --> 00:37:59,387
Leo, stop it. We're doing this together.
We didn't break any laws.

381
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:03,706
No matter what he says or does, we're
gonna do the right thing. So just relax.

382
00:38:05,394 --> 00:38:07,066
Jesus!

383
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:11,306
- Okay. Can we go home now, please?
- Yeah, all right.

384
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:16,909
It's him.

385
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:22,193
- Let's just get this over with.
- Okay.

386
00:38:38,594 --> 00:38:41,062
This changes everything.

387
00:38:42,474 --> 00:38:45,227
- Now somebody else knows.
- Oh, God.

388
00:38:45,274 --> 00:38:47,629
- What happened to the boy?
- He's alive.

389
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:52,429
He's being held in a lockdown unit
in a Chicago hospital.

390
00:38:52,474 --> 00:38:54,351
Why don't we tell
somebody?

391
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:56,265
Because we are somebody,
Leo.

392
00:38:56,354 --> 00:38:58,788
We're the ones that are
ultimately responsible for this.

393
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:00,870
There isn't anybody
to tell.

394
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:03,951
So I want you to keep
the puzzle line open 24 hours a day.

395
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:06,343
And I want you two to do
your goddamn fuckin' jobs!

396
00:39:06,434 --> 00:39:08,504
Quiet!

397
00:39:11,994 --> 00:39:15,430
Maybe I'm goin' about this
the wrong way.

398
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:18,511
My wife says my people skills
are like my cooking skills.

399
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:20,749
Quick and tasteless.

400
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:23,632
But in the end,
it's about saving lives.

401
00:39:23,714 --> 00:39:25,545
Isn't that the point?

402
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:28,273
- Yes?
- Yes.

403
00:39:28,314 --> 00:39:31,465
I know a man named Rasheed Halabi,
born in Paramus, New Jersey.

404
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:34,273
Valedictorian of his high school class,
worked his way through M.I.T.

405
00:39:34,354 --> 00:39:37,312
Right now he's a colonel
in Saddam's Republican Guard.

406
00:39:37,394 --> 00:39:41,467
We put him there. It's him
this code is protecting.

407
00:39:41,554 --> 00:39:44,705
There are thousands of other
men and women just like him...

408
00:39:44,754 --> 00:39:47,951
whose identities are protected
by this code.

409
00:39:48,034 --> 00:39:50,025
We can save their lives.

410
00:39:50,114 --> 00:39:54,232
I give you my pledge.
I want you to give me yours.

411
00:39:54,314 --> 00:39:57,704
Diligence, loyalty
and above all...

412
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:01,391
absolute silence.

413
00:40:03,714 --> 00:40:06,512
This is kind of an interesting story.

414
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:09,068
The television program 60 Minutes
right here on CBS?

415
00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:32,072
I've changed tires doin' 86.
You know what I'm sayin'?

416
00:40:45,554 --> 00:40:48,307
Long ways from home

417
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:51,147
Can't sleep at night

418
00:40:51,194 --> 00:40:55,267
Grab your telephone 'cause
something just ain't right

419
00:40:55,314 --> 00:40:57,225
It's evil

420
00:40:59,074 --> 00:41:01,872
Evil is goin' on

421
00:41:05,874 --> 00:41:10,072
Well, I'm warnin' you,
girl

422
00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:12,304
You better watch
your happy home

423
00:41:17,754 --> 00:41:20,314
Long ways from home

424
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:24,672
Can't sleep at all
'Cause another--

425
00:41:45,994 --> 00:41:47,825
Where is everyone?

426
00:41:47,914 --> 00:41:49,950
Where's the police? Where's the guard
that was sitting right here?

427
00:41:50,034 --> 00:41:52,070
They were called off half an hour ago.
Told they weren't needed.

428
00:41:52,114 --> 00:41:54,389
Take me to see Simon Lynch right now.
Unlock that door.

429
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:57,307
We just transferred him
to pediatrics.

430
00:41:57,394 --> 00:42:00,591
- Where's that?
- Room 1106. Up those stairs one flight.

431
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:02,989
- Who authorized the transfer?
- His parents.

432
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:05,912
I could understand.
They didn't want their little kid on--

433
00:42:43,314 --> 00:42:45,270
Can I help you?

434
00:42:47,154 --> 00:42:49,714
Hi. I'm with the F.B.I.

435
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:52,706
I'm lookin' for Simon Lynch.
Do you know where he is?

436
00:42:52,754 --> 00:42:55,222
He suffered a minor head injury.
Nothing serious.

437
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:58,624
We had to take him
down to X-ray.

438
00:42:58,674 --> 00:43:00,665
Where is the X-ray room?

439
00:43:00,754 --> 00:43:02,984
Radiology.
Seventh floor.

440
00:43:03,074 --> 00:43:05,110
Great. Thanks.

441
00:43:06,194 --> 00:43:08,424
No problem.

442
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,389
Shh. Shh. Shh.

443
00:44:17,434 --> 00:44:19,629
Shh. Ow!

444
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:34,228
Here we go. Here we go.
Simon, get in the elevator.

445
00:44:34,314 --> 00:44:37,033
- Hi. Yeah.
- A little crowded, huh?

446
00:44:41,114 --> 00:44:43,070
Just made it, Doctor.

447
00:44:43,154 --> 00:44:45,384
You must be new.
Welcome to Concordia.

448
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:47,664
Thank you.
You're very kind.

449
00:44:52,194 --> 00:44:54,105
Eight.

450
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,424
Seven.

451
00:44:56,514 --> 00:44:58,232
Six.

452
00:44:58,314 --> 00:45:01,226
Five.

453
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,753
Four.

454
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:09,270
Three.
Two.

455
00:45:09,354 --> 00:45:11,629
One.

456
00:45:11,674 --> 00:45:13,904
Thanks for the ride.
Good night.

457
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:16,030
Wait!

458
00:45:17,994 --> 00:45:19,712
What's going on?

459
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:33,470
Get up in that seat.

460
00:45:35,314 --> 00:45:38,465
Move it!

461
00:45:52,354 --> 00:45:54,743
All right, leave it off.
Leave it off.

462
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:57,109
Come on, Simon. We don't need
any more attention right now.

463
00:45:59,354 --> 00:46:01,868
Leave it alone,
all right?

464
00:46:01,954 --> 00:46:06,232
Keep off the buttons.
Okay, okay, okay!

465
00:46:07,954 --> 00:46:10,024
Leave the buttons alone,
goddamn it!

466
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:14,192
Please. Please.

467
00:46:18,154 --> 00:46:21,703
"One small step
for mankind."

468
00:46:26,714 --> 00:46:28,466
Get down!

469
00:46:53,194 --> 00:46:55,310
Mommy! Daddy!
Mommy! Daddy!

470
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,231
Mommy! Daddy!

471
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,748
Mommy! Daddy!
Mommy! Daddy!

472
00:46:59,794 --> 00:47:02,706
Mommy! Daddy!
Mommy! Daddy!

473
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:07,149
Let's go.
Hang on to the fence.

474
00:47:07,234 --> 00:47:10,670
Hang on to the fence.
Hang on to the fence.

475
00:47:10,754 --> 00:47:12,949
Let's go.

476
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:33,588
No! No!

477
00:47:34,754 --> 00:47:38,190
Simon! No!

478
00:48:12,794 --> 00:48:16,992
Come on. Let's go, Simon.
Come on.

479
00:49:05,794 --> 00:49:07,989
"Friends."

480
00:49:08,074 --> 00:49:11,305
"Mr. Pasquale."
Bus driver.

481
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:13,544
Pasqual-ee.

482
00:49:13,634 --> 00:49:16,706
Pasqual-ee? That's his name,
Mr. Pasquale?

483
00:49:17,994 --> 00:49:20,110
"Do not talk to strangers."

484
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:22,754
Is that why you won't talk to me?
You think I'm a stranger?

485
00:49:35,634 --> 00:49:37,829
Art.

486
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:40,468
That's me.
I'm your friend.

487
00:49:40,554 --> 00:49:45,389
- See? Art is your friend.
- No! Art is a stranger!

488
00:49:45,434 --> 00:49:48,267
- Okay, Simon. Okay.
- Art is a stranger!

489
00:49:48,314 --> 00:49:50,828
- All right!
- Art is a stranger!

490
00:49:52,754 --> 00:49:55,666
Art is a stranger.

491
00:51:06,674 --> 00:51:09,427
Motherfucker!

492
00:51:22,674 --> 00:51:24,710
Who are you?

493
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:39,384
All right.

494
00:51:42,234 --> 00:51:46,671
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Come on, Simon.

495
00:51:46,714 --> 00:51:48,670
What the hell
happened to you?

496
00:51:59,394 --> 00:52:01,703
You kidnapped this kid
from the hospital? Are you crazy?

497
00:52:01,794 --> 00:52:04,308
- What are you talking about?
- Lomax has been calling me
every 15 minutes.

498
00:52:04,394 --> 00:52:07,830
- There's a warrant out
for your arrest.
- I killed a guy on the C.T.A.

499
00:52:07,914 --> 00:52:11,463
- Oh, Christ!
- I had to. He was trying to kill us.

500
00:52:11,554 --> 00:52:15,229
- How did this happen?
- Somebody pulled the cops off
the kid at the hospital.

501
00:52:15,314 --> 00:52:17,544
It's not a murder-suicide.
The mom and dad got in the way.

502
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:21,382
They're trying to get the kid. If he
hadn't hidden, they'd have got him too.

503
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:25,149
- I cannot handle
this paranoid conspiracy crap.
- It is a conspiracy.

504
00:52:25,234 --> 00:52:27,065
Who pulled the cops
off the kid?

505
00:52:27,154 --> 00:52:31,033
Did dead Martin and Jenny say
"Take my kid out of protective
custody"? This is real!

506
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,945
I don't give a fuck
if it's real.

507
00:52:33,034 --> 00:52:36,913
If I don't call Lomax right now,
I'm an accessory to this.

508
00:52:36,994 --> 00:52:40,828
If you don't get on the phone now, call
Concordia or C.T.A., you're a dumb cop.

509
00:52:44,314 --> 00:52:48,023
Tell them to bring
a body bag to put the pieces in.

510
00:52:49,314 --> 00:52:51,350
Arthur.

511
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:54,710
Hi, Dana.
Sorry we woke you up.

512
00:52:54,794 --> 00:52:56,989
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

513
00:52:57,074 --> 00:52:59,713
It's been too long.

514
00:52:59,794 --> 00:53:02,706
Try not to bleed
on my carpet.

515
00:53:07,234 --> 00:53:09,111
His name's Simon.

516
00:53:12,394 --> 00:53:14,225
Hello, Simon.

517
00:53:15,314 --> 00:53:17,987
I bet you're hungry.

518
00:53:18,034 --> 00:53:21,310
I have peanut butter and jelly
in the kitchen. How's that sound?

519
00:53:22,994 --> 00:53:25,110
This is my son T.J.

520
00:53:25,194 --> 00:53:27,469
- T.J., this is Simon.
- Hi.

521
00:53:27,514 --> 00:53:30,631
Why don't we go
in the kitchen--

522
00:53:35,354 --> 00:53:38,187
T.J., why don't we go in the kitchen
and make something to eat...

523
00:53:38,274 --> 00:53:41,107
and maybe Simon
will come with us?

524
00:54:00,914 --> 00:54:02,745
Here you go, Art.

525
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:06,110
It's still damp,
but at least it's clean.

526
00:54:06,194 --> 00:54:08,185
- Thanks, Dana.
- You're welcome.

527
00:54:09,874 --> 00:54:13,833
Simon, I think these
will fit you.

528
00:54:13,874 --> 00:54:16,434
Not my Frank Thomas shirt!

529
00:54:16,474 --> 00:54:18,783
Remember what
I told you about sharing?

530
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:21,632
I thought you were done
taking those downers.

531
00:54:22,834 --> 00:54:25,712
Yeah. So?

532
00:54:25,754 --> 00:54:28,791
- There's no body on the EI tracks.
- What?

533
00:54:28,874 --> 00:54:32,184
No body. No blood.
No casing. Nothing.

534
00:54:32,274 --> 00:54:35,311
Who could've got it cleaned up
that fast?

535
00:54:35,354 --> 00:54:37,345
- Give him up.
- What?

536
00:54:37,394 --> 00:54:40,386
The kid. Give him up.
Take him back.

537
00:54:40,434 --> 00:54:43,949
- Would you give your own kid up?
- It's not your kid!

538
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:47,663
Yeah? Well, right now,
he's nobody's kid.

539
00:54:47,754 --> 00:54:51,349
His mom and dad got shot dead
by a real bad guy. Remember?

540
00:54:52,794 --> 00:54:56,503
- Let's go, Simon.
- Let me get these clothes on him.

541
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,983
I need your car keys.

542
00:55:00,474 --> 00:55:04,990
Let me just walk around
the streets with this kid now? Come on.

543
00:55:09,074 --> 00:55:12,749
-I'm reporting it stolen in the mornin'.
-Thanks.

544
00:55:24,874 --> 00:55:28,503
Daddy is going to sing

545
00:55:28,594 --> 00:55:32,428
Daddy is going to sing

546
00:55:32,474 --> 00:55:36,592
Daddy is going to sing

547
00:55:36,634 --> 00:55:40,866
- Daddy is going to sing
- How can you not be tired?

548
00:55:40,914 --> 00:55:43,986
Daddy is going to sing

549
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:48,829
Daddy's not here right now,
Simon.

550
00:55:48,914 --> 00:55:51,906
Daddy is going to sing

551
00:55:51,954 --> 00:55:55,913
I told you, your daddy
is not here now!

552
00:55:55,954 --> 00:55:59,788
Oh, God. How am I supposed
to explain this?

553
00:56:02,034 --> 00:56:05,822
Daddy is going to sing

554
00:56:05,874 --> 00:56:09,230
Daddy is going to sing

555
00:56:09,274 --> 00:56:11,947
Daddy is going to sing

556
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:15,629
Just going to close
my eyes for a minute.

557
00:56:45,274 --> 00:56:47,788
Damn! Shit!

558
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:51,230
Stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid!

559
00:57:00,594 --> 00:57:03,745
Come on, Simon.

560
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,871
Where the hell are you?

561
00:57:38,594 --> 00:57:41,984
Simon? Simon.

562
00:58:04,634 --> 00:58:06,704
Let's go for a ride.

563
00:58:21,114 --> 00:58:24,743
Left.
Left on Kenwood.

564
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:26,671
Left.

565
00:58:26,714 --> 00:58:30,389
Okay.
We are going left.

566
00:58:32,274 --> 00:58:36,506
Howard Avenue to "J" Street.

567
00:58:36,594 --> 00:58:39,392
That's right.

568
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,988
"J" Street...

569
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:47,392
to West Twenty-Third Street.

570
00:58:47,474 --> 00:58:49,430
You know where
we're goin'?

571
00:58:49,514 --> 00:58:52,665
Simon is going home.

572
00:58:53,794 --> 00:58:57,309
Yeah.
Simon is going home.

573
00:59:14,434 --> 00:59:16,311
Come on, come on.

574
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:23,146
Mommy, Simon is home.

575
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:39,664
Mommy!

576
00:59:39,754 --> 00:59:42,712
Simon is home.

577
00:59:44,794 --> 00:59:47,183
Simon is home.

578
00:59:57,554 --> 00:59:59,431
Want this?

579
01:00:09,394 --> 01:00:12,147
Very hot.

580
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:15,067
Sip it slowly.

581
01:01:15,954 --> 01:01:19,424
Get it, please.

582
01:01:22,194 --> 01:01:24,947
Congratulations.
You've reached the Puzzle Center.

583
01:01:25,034 --> 01:01:27,104
For solving one
of our master puzzles...

584
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:29,463
you've won a subscription
to the magazine of your choice.

585
01:01:29,554 --> 01:01:32,068
Can I please have your name,
address and telephone number?

586
01:01:32,114 --> 01:01:34,105
You are...

587
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:36,424
a stranger.

588
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:40,945
That's him! He's calling from
his own house. We have to call Kudrow.

589
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,264
- What are you doing?
- Is that you, Simon?

590
01:01:43,314 --> 01:01:48,104
- Simon, is that you?
- Let me have the phone.
Who is this?

591
01:01:48,154 --> 01:01:50,668
Answer me!
Who is this? Hello?

592
01:01:50,714 --> 01:01:53,069
This is the F.B.I. We have this number
and we will trace it.

593
01:01:53,114 --> 01:01:57,983
- Who is this?
- No, you won't.
You can't trace this number.

594
01:01:58,034 --> 01:01:59,911
Who is this?
What agency do you work for?

595
01:01:59,954 --> 01:02:02,673
- Answer me.
- Dean, do not tell him who we are.

596
01:02:02,714 --> 01:02:05,387
Please don't tell him
my name.

597
01:02:05,474 --> 01:02:07,783
I need some more time,
all right?

598
01:02:07,834 --> 01:02:10,507
Don't call this number again.

599
01:02:10,554 --> 01:02:12,749
I'm gonna set up
an E-mail address.

600
01:02:12,794 --> 01:02:15,069
Einstein.
Check it in the morning.

601
01:02:15,154 --> 01:02:17,873
No, no, don't hang--

602
01:02:29,554 --> 01:02:31,784
Mommy, Daddy.

603
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:34,183
Come on, Simon,
let's go. Come on.

604
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:37,306
- Mommy, Daddy.
- Let's go. Come on.

605
01:02:37,394 --> 01:02:39,624
That's it.
Come on.

606
01:02:43,914 --> 01:02:47,987
- Dean, please don't do this.
- If he did it once, he can do it again.

607
01:02:48,074 --> 01:02:50,827
You think this F.B.I. agent is smart
enough to figure out what you're doing?

608
01:02:50,874 --> 01:02:55,026
- He better be, because
that boy's life is at stake.
- This is bad.

609
01:02:55,114 --> 01:02:58,186
It's not fair to me, because
he'll assume I was in on it too!

610
01:02:58,234 --> 01:03:00,304
I don't think
they can hear you on the moon.

611
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:02,589
- Listen.
- I don't want to listen to you.
You're scaring me.

612
01:03:02,674 --> 01:03:05,142
If anything happens to me,
you're gonna know who did it.

613
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:07,384
I expect you to do what
you're supposed to do.

614
01:03:09,714 --> 01:03:11,750
No.

615
01:03:11,794 --> 01:03:15,673
You will.
I know it.

616
01:03:19,674 --> 01:03:21,790
Try C.I.A.

617
01:03:21,874 --> 01:03:23,705
Nope.

618
01:03:23,794 --> 01:03:26,024
Let's try F.B.I.

619
01:03:36,074 --> 01:03:38,463
- Good, good.
- Mm-hmm.

620
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,903
Um... Albert.

621
01:03:47,634 --> 01:03:50,706
Try "E" equals "M-C" squared,
all caps.

622
01:03:54,474 --> 01:03:56,942
Mm-hmm.

623
01:04:04,154 --> 01:04:07,066
- I'll give you some privacy.
- Thanks.

624
01:04:18,194 --> 01:04:21,311
Hey, partner...

625
01:04:21,394 --> 01:04:24,227
I need your help
with something.

626
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:26,993
It's a puzzle.

627
01:04:27,074 --> 01:04:30,032
Can you help me
with a puzzle?

628
01:04:30,114 --> 01:04:32,423
- Puzzle.
- That's right. A puzzle.

629
01:04:32,474 --> 01:04:35,068
It's right over here.
Come on.

630
01:04:40,594 --> 01:04:43,870
All right. I'm gonna
lift you up now, okay?

631
01:04:43,954 --> 01:04:46,309
Let's put you up
on the chair.

632
01:04:48,914 --> 01:04:52,589
Can you read that?

633
01:04:52,634 --> 01:04:55,467
Simon, what does it say?

634
01:04:57,114 --> 01:04:58,991
"Today.

635
01:04:59,034 --> 01:05:01,070
"12:00.

636
01:05:01,114 --> 01:05:04,026
The Wrigley Building."

637
01:05:04,114 --> 01:05:06,423
Good boy.

638
01:05:06,714 --> 01:05:09,353
I'm gonna start to take this personally
if you don't--

639
01:05:09,394 --> 01:05:11,703
Hello? Hello?

640
01:05:11,794 --> 01:05:13,671
Oh!

641
01:05:13,714 --> 01:05:15,989
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.
Are you okay?

642
01:05:16,074 --> 01:05:18,030
I'm fine, really.
I'm sorry.

643
01:05:18,074 --> 01:05:21,384
It was my fault. I should've watched
where I was going.

644
01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:23,390
No, I shouldn't
have had it there.

645
01:05:23,474 --> 01:05:26,511
The way my day's going,
I'm lucky you didn't trip and sue me.

646
01:05:26,554 --> 01:05:29,864
What do you got in there?
Plumbing supplies?

647
01:05:29,914 --> 01:05:34,112
Look, this is gonna sound crazy,
but I have a little problem...

648
01:05:34,194 --> 01:05:36,754
and I was wondering
if you could help me out.

649
01:05:36,794 --> 01:05:39,433
You see that little boy
sitting over there?

650
01:05:39,474 --> 01:05:42,546
Do you think you could watch him
for a couple of minutes?

651
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:46,627
You didn't just accidentally
trip over the case, did you?

652
01:05:46,674 --> 01:05:51,145
He's autistic.
And I'm his Big Brother.

653
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:55,113
Not his real big brother, you know?
Big Brothers of America.

654
01:05:55,154 --> 01:05:58,464
It's going really well, but I need
to get a prescription filled for him.

655
01:05:58,514 --> 01:06:03,144
Normally I'd take him with me,
but I don't like to disturb him
when he's sitting so calmly.

656
01:06:03,194 --> 01:06:06,425
You don't have to do anything.
Just sit here and be your lovely self.

657
01:06:06,514 --> 01:06:08,425
Please.

658
01:06:08,474 --> 01:06:12,228
- Okay, yeah. What's his name?
- Simon.

659
01:06:12,274 --> 01:06:14,230
- You sure this is okay?
- Yeah.

660
01:06:14,314 --> 01:06:17,465
If I can handle a district manager,
I can handle anyone.

661
01:06:17,554 --> 01:06:21,183
Thank you. I will be right back.
Oh!

662
01:06:21,234 --> 01:06:23,304
- What's your name?
- Stacey.

663
01:06:23,394 --> 01:06:26,192
- Stacey--
- Sebring.

664
01:06:26,234 --> 01:06:29,704
Stacey, thank you so much.
I'll be right back. I promise.

665
01:06:33,394 --> 01:06:36,306
Would have done it
without the flattery?

666
01:06:42,194 --> 01:06:44,071
Hey, Simon.

667
01:06:58,194 --> 01:07:00,344
Just keep walking.
Keep walking.

668
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:02,823
- Jeffries?
- Just keep walking.

669
01:07:02,874 --> 01:07:05,069
I wasn't sure
you'd be here.

670
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:09,147
Simon's read the code twice. That's
really incredible. Also very dangerous.

671
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:12,192
- Who do you work for? The C.I.A.?
- No.

672
01:07:12,274 --> 01:07:15,471
- The Defense Department?
- I'm afraid you're not that lucky.

673
01:07:15,514 --> 01:07:18,551
I think the F.B.I. Iikes to call us
"No Such Agency."

674
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:22,673
- Why does the N.S.A. want
a 9-year-old autistic boy?
- The brain is still a mystery.

675
01:07:22,714 --> 01:07:24,193
What?

676
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:26,424
The Reagan administration mandated
the National Security Agency...

677
01:07:26,514 --> 01:07:29,824
to generate a new code
to protect American informants
working for foreign governments.

678
01:07:29,874 --> 01:07:32,991
We developed a super code
at huge expense.

679
01:07:33,074 --> 01:07:37,192
Named it Mercury.
We thought it was impenetrable.

680
01:07:37,234 --> 01:07:39,794
You're telling me a kid cracked
a government super code?

681
01:07:39,834 --> 01:07:42,428
It doesn't matter.
He can read it.

682
01:07:42,514 --> 01:07:45,790
He might even be able to recreate it.
That's why his life is in danger.

683
01:07:45,874 --> 01:07:50,231
- N.S.A. is willing to have this
boy killed to protect a code?
- We may have already tried.

684
01:07:50,314 --> 01:07:54,102
I think my division chief
may have given orders--

685
01:07:54,194 --> 01:07:57,391
I'm a cryptographer, a nerd.
I don't know what these people do.

686
01:07:57,474 --> 01:08:00,113
Maybe it's routine killing kids,
or maybe my boss is an aberration.

687
01:08:08,154 --> 01:08:11,146
Call an ambulance!
Get an ambulance!

688
01:08:11,194 --> 01:08:14,152
Move it! Move it!

689
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:16,185
Get out of the way!
Move it!

690
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:19,270
Excuse me.
Watch out! Watch out!

691
01:08:19,314 --> 01:08:22,590
- Get out of the way!
- Watch out! Watch out!

692
01:08:22,674 --> 01:08:25,188
- Move it! Goddamn it, move!
- Move!

693
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:28,828
Move it!
Get out of the way!

694
01:08:28,914 --> 01:08:32,384
Look out! Look out!
Move! Get out of the way!

695
01:08:36,074 --> 01:08:38,144
Get down! Get down!

696
01:09:16,914 --> 01:09:18,745
Goddamn it.

697
01:09:41,834 --> 01:09:45,827
Excuse me. F.B.I.
Where's your security office?

698
01:09:45,874 --> 01:09:48,342
- Through the door to the right.
- Thank you.

699
01:10:02,314 --> 01:10:05,033
Hi. Special Agent Jeffries
with the F.B.I.

700
01:10:05,074 --> 01:10:07,634
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

701
01:10:09,114 --> 01:10:12,743
- Where's the tape for this camera?
- Um, here it is.

702
01:10:24,274 --> 01:10:27,425
No, um... Iook,
it's my ass if you take that.

703
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:30,591
Then don't tell anyone.
Thank you.

704
01:10:45,714 --> 01:10:48,308
Damn it.

705
01:11:01,114 --> 01:11:03,628
Excuse me,
excuse me please.

706
01:11:03,674 --> 01:11:05,551
Excuse me.
Whoa!

707
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:10,426
Hey! Come on.
We gotta go.

708
01:11:12,274 --> 01:11:14,185
- Sorry.
- What happened?

709
01:11:14,274 --> 01:11:17,584
He almost got away. You didn't tell me
I have to watch him every second.

710
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:19,983
Sorry. I shouldn't
have left the coffee shop.

711
01:11:20,074 --> 01:11:22,668
No! No!

712
01:11:22,754 --> 01:11:24,585
All right, all right.

713
01:11:24,674 --> 01:11:28,189
Don't scream, don't scream.
All right.

714
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:31,984
Oh, my God.

715
01:11:32,074 --> 01:11:34,383
He doesn't see things
like other people do.

716
01:11:43,634 --> 01:11:46,944
Where did you just go?
Rob a bank or something?

717
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,869
I gotta get him out of here.
Let's go, Simon.

718
01:11:52,914 --> 01:11:57,226
Thank you, Stacey.
Thanks for all your help. Come on.

719
01:12:06,354 --> 01:12:09,027
- My dad will kill for this. How much?
- One hundred.

720
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:11,952
Get real.
Hey!

721
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,304
Have you ever thought, what are
we gonna collect when we get old?

722
01:12:15,354 --> 01:12:18,869
Plaid shirts
and Kramer dolls?

723
01:12:18,954 --> 01:12:20,831
What's the matter?

724
01:12:23,434 --> 01:12:26,631
- Dean is dead. He's been shot.
- What?

725
01:12:28,034 --> 01:12:30,389
He wanted to go to Chicago.
I said, "Don't go."

726
01:12:30,474 --> 01:12:33,386
He wanted me to go with him
and help him.

727
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:36,386
Someone shot him?
Who would shoot him?

728
01:12:36,434 --> 01:12:38,311
I can't tell you.

729
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,744
Leo, I want to help you,
but you have to let me in.

730
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:44,029
Tell me what's going on.

731
01:12:44,114 --> 01:12:47,584
- He'll find out.
- Who? You mean Kudrow?

732
01:12:47,634 --> 01:12:50,228
I don't have the capabilities
to E-mail over his head.

733
01:12:50,314 --> 01:12:52,544
I can't use the phone
because everything gets recorded.

734
01:12:52,594 --> 01:12:56,792
Everything is connected to everything.
There is nothing I can do.

735
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:10,546
Low-tech rules.

736
01:13:34,634 --> 01:13:36,590
Congratulations.

737
01:13:36,634 --> 01:13:39,706
As of this morning, you made it
to the very top of our own perp board.

738
01:13:39,794 --> 01:13:42,513
I don't have to tell you
how profoundly pissed Lomax is.

739
01:13:42,554 --> 01:13:46,388
He's keeping a lid on it to cover
his ass, but you don't have much time.

740
01:13:46,474 --> 01:13:50,103
Yeah. Did you find out
who the shooter is?

741
01:13:50,194 --> 01:13:53,709
Whatever happened to, "Good morning.
How are you? Sorry about your car.

742
01:13:53,754 --> 01:13:57,064
It got impounded. You won't be able
to get it for two weeks."

743
01:13:57,154 --> 01:14:01,067
- Did you get in trouble?
- No. I told them you stole it.

744
01:14:02,834 --> 01:14:05,109
Found him in the
Defense Department data banks.

745
01:14:05,194 --> 01:14:08,072
His name is Peter Burrell,
Special Forces.

746
01:14:09,394 --> 01:14:11,271
So, let's bring him in.

747
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:15,023
Can't. Unless you want
to dig him up. He's dead.

748
01:14:15,114 --> 01:14:18,345
He's listed as killed
in Beirut in 1982.

749
01:14:22,194 --> 01:14:24,230
You still think
I'm paranoid?

750
01:14:24,274 --> 01:14:26,742
I don't know, man.
Who knows?

751
01:14:26,834 --> 01:14:29,871
But if you are, then I guess I'm
paranoid too. We're in over our heads.

752
01:14:29,914 --> 01:14:32,144
- We can't fuck with the N.S.A.
- So?

753
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:37,592
- We find somebody
to talk to about this.
- Lomax? He's a Company man.

754
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:40,313
- The N.S.A. could've gotten to him too.
- Fine. I'll go above Lomax.

755
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:42,988
I don't want you
to do anything else.

756
01:14:43,034 --> 01:14:47,346
You got a wife and kid to take care of.
Go do that. Really.

757
01:14:47,434 --> 01:14:49,504
All right then.
What are you gonna do?

758
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:53,231
I don't know.

759
01:14:53,274 --> 01:14:56,072
Why are you doing this, Art?

760
01:14:56,114 --> 01:14:58,548
That kid isn't
your responsibility.

761
01:14:58,634 --> 01:15:01,353
Whose responsibility
is he?

762
01:15:03,354 --> 01:15:06,664
Look at him.

763
01:15:06,754 --> 01:15:09,632
He looks like
a regular kid, right?

764
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:13,548
One little circuit
gets crossed. Zap!

765
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:16,068
He should've been smart,
go to college...

766
01:15:16,114 --> 01:15:20,266
meet a girl, get married,
have some kids, be cool.

767
01:15:22,074 --> 01:15:25,384
Are we talking about him, Art,
or are we talking about you?

768
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:33,588
Thanks for getting this
together for me.

769
01:15:33,674 --> 01:15:35,869
Be careful.

770
01:15:35,954 --> 01:15:37,467
Yeah.

771
01:15:55,154 --> 01:15:57,873
Jesus!

772
01:15:57,914 --> 01:16:00,474
Who the fuck are you?

773
01:16:00,554 --> 01:16:03,466
Oh. Oh.

774
01:16:03,514 --> 01:16:05,391
Please. Please--

775
01:16:48,594 --> 01:16:52,348
Okay! Oh. You.
What do you want?

776
01:16:52,434 --> 01:16:57,269
It's 2:00 in the morning,
and you don't know me this well.

777
01:16:57,354 --> 01:17:00,949
- I need to talk to you.
- You're gonna wake up my neighbors.

778
01:17:03,034 --> 01:17:05,673
Oh, man.

779
01:17:09,234 --> 01:17:11,350
We need a place to stay.

780
01:17:11,434 --> 01:17:14,312
- How'd you get this address?
- I looked it up.

781
01:17:14,354 --> 01:17:16,470
No, it's not listed.

782
01:17:16,554 --> 01:17:20,706
The name of your company was on the side
of your sample case. I called them.

783
01:17:20,754 --> 01:17:25,066
Right. Call my company, ask 'em
for my address, they give it to you?

784
01:17:25,114 --> 01:17:26,752
Nope.

785
01:17:26,834 --> 01:17:31,066
Please. Stacey.

786
01:17:31,154 --> 01:17:33,873
I'm an F.B.I. agent.

787
01:17:33,914 --> 01:17:37,224
Yeah. I bought one of those
for my little brother, $5.

788
01:17:37,274 --> 01:17:40,550
I saw you hiding from the police today.
I'll give them a call.

789
01:17:40,594 --> 01:17:44,553
Listen.
I really am an F.B.I agent.

790
01:17:44,594 --> 01:17:47,552
Please help us.

791
01:17:47,634 --> 01:17:51,422
- Hello, Simon.
- Hello.

792
01:17:52,954 --> 01:17:54,831
Please.

793
01:17:54,874 --> 01:17:56,944
Move your foot.

794
01:18:08,954 --> 01:18:10,592
Thank you.

795
01:18:13,554 --> 01:18:16,193
Thank you very much.

796
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:20,631
Would it be stupid to ask
why you don't call the F.B.I. for help?

797
01:18:20,714 --> 01:18:22,705
The F.B.I.'s
looking for me too.

798
01:18:22,794 --> 01:18:24,432
Oh, great.

799
01:18:24,474 --> 01:18:28,706
So, how does this work? You murder me
now or you wait till I'm asleep?

800
01:18:31,154 --> 01:18:33,509
Simon needs to get
a little sleep.

801
01:18:33,554 --> 01:18:38,184
He's been up for a long time,
and you seemed like a nice person.

802
01:18:39,474 --> 01:18:44,594
Come on, Simon.
I'll show you where your bed is.

803
01:18:44,674 --> 01:18:46,869
Come on.

804
01:18:46,954 --> 01:18:49,548
Are you thirsty?

805
01:18:49,594 --> 01:18:52,631
He gets the guest room.
You get the couch.

806
01:18:52,714 --> 01:18:54,750
There's food in there.

807
01:18:54,834 --> 01:18:58,304
The bathroom.
You can wash up after yourself.

808
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:06,144
Let's take this off.

809
01:19:08,514 --> 01:19:11,631
That's good.
Now lie down.

810
01:19:14,994 --> 01:19:17,508
Okay?

811
01:19:17,554 --> 01:19:20,068
Let's take these off,
all right?

812
01:19:20,114 --> 01:19:23,663
One. Two.

813
01:19:23,754 --> 01:19:26,507
Okay.

814
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,704
That's good.

815
01:19:31,154 --> 01:19:33,384
You okay?

816
01:19:33,434 --> 01:19:35,311
Good night, Simon.

817
01:19:37,354 --> 01:19:38,992
Look...

818
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:42,066
I have to be up
in a few hours.

819
01:19:42,154 --> 01:19:44,827
I have to fly to Des Moines
in the morning.

820
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:49,351
If I don't make a sale there tomorrow,
then I don't pay my rent.

821
01:19:49,394 --> 01:19:53,353
So, unless there's anything else you
need, I'd like to get some sleep now.

822
01:19:53,394 --> 01:19:56,943
No, there's nothing else.
Thank you.

823
01:19:57,034 --> 01:20:00,913
I promise you we'll be out of here
first thing in the morning.

824
01:20:33,434 --> 01:20:37,222
Leo, you won't believe the morning.
Did I leave my--

825
01:20:37,314 --> 01:20:39,430
Leo?

826
01:20:45,034 --> 01:20:47,389
Oh, my God!

827
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:03,469
Tom, there's a woman downstairs
asking to see Art Jeffries.

828
01:21:03,514 --> 01:21:07,143
- Bring her up.
- She won't talk to anyone except Art.

829
01:21:07,194 --> 01:21:09,105
Do me a favor.

830
01:21:09,194 --> 01:21:11,867
I haven't
logged it in... yet.

831
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:13,785
Good.

832
01:21:44,314 --> 01:21:47,511
- How ya doin', man?
- Anybody else with you?

833
01:21:47,594 --> 01:21:50,028
No.

834
01:21:50,074 --> 01:21:52,542
This is Emily Lang.

835
01:21:52,594 --> 01:21:55,631
Emily, why don't you have a seat?
Go ahead.

836
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:04,510
Are you Art Jeffries?

837
01:22:04,594 --> 01:22:06,983
Yeah,
I'm Art Jeffries.

838
01:22:14,834 --> 01:22:17,985
My boyfriend's last will
and testament.

839
01:22:18,034 --> 01:22:20,423
I worked with him
at N.S.A.

840
01:22:21,714 --> 01:22:24,433
The other voice
on the line.

841
01:22:24,474 --> 01:22:27,386
His name was Leo.

842
01:22:27,474 --> 01:22:29,783
He was gonna mail one letter
to you.

843
01:22:29,874 --> 01:22:33,310
The other was addressed to
the Senate Oversight Committee.

844
01:22:33,394 --> 01:22:35,385
The letters are gone.
This is all that's left.

845
01:22:35,474 --> 01:22:37,590
"It has come
to my attention...

846
01:22:37,674 --> 01:22:41,667
"that my section director and
immediate superior, Nicholas Kudrow...

847
01:22:41,714 --> 01:22:45,707
"was directly involved in the deaths
of Martin and Jenny Lynch...

848
01:22:47,674 --> 01:22:49,869
"the parents
of Simon Lynch...

849
01:22:49,954 --> 01:22:53,071
and the death of Dean Crandell,
my colleague and friend."

850
01:22:53,114 --> 01:22:57,426
They killed Leo too right after
he wrote that letter.

851
01:22:57,514 --> 01:23:00,631
I'm sorry.

852
01:23:00,714 --> 01:23:02,625
I'm sorry.

853
01:23:07,194 --> 01:23:10,186
Thank you for coming down,
Emily.

854
01:23:10,234 --> 01:23:12,987
I'm sorry about Leo.

855
01:23:13,074 --> 01:23:15,349
You said you were gonna be out before
I went to Des Moines...

856
01:23:15,434 --> 01:23:17,709
where hopefully I was gonna sell
enough shoes to make the rent.

857
01:23:17,794 --> 01:23:21,343
Only I didn't go to Des Moines
and I didn't make the rent
because you had an emergency.

858
01:23:21,394 --> 01:23:23,305
It was an emergency.

859
01:23:23,354 --> 01:23:25,743
Maybe you're one of those guys
that has constant emergencies.

860
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:29,668
Everything has to be about excitement.
There are guys like that.

861
01:23:29,714 --> 01:23:33,468
Yes, I know, but I don't happen
to be one of them.

862
01:23:33,554 --> 01:23:37,706
Listen to me. Look at me!
This is not about me.

863
01:23:37,754 --> 01:23:40,587
It's about that little boy.
And he needs some help.

864
01:23:40,634 --> 01:23:43,387
As far as I can tell,
you are a decent, caring person.

865
01:23:43,474 --> 01:23:48,070
I promise you we will be out
of your life as soon as possible. Okay?

866
01:23:48,114 --> 01:23:50,992
Look, if for some reason
there is an emergency--

867
01:23:51,034 --> 01:23:53,867
- Oh! You mean a different emergency!
- Yes, a different emergency.

868
01:23:53,954 --> 01:23:58,072
Do not call the police, okay?
You call this guy. He's with the F.B.I.

869
01:23:58,154 --> 01:24:01,066
I call the F.B.I.,
not the police?

870
01:24:01,154 --> 01:24:04,112
- Right. The police can't protect Simon.
- Right.

871
01:24:04,154 --> 01:24:06,543
Look.

872
01:24:06,634 --> 01:24:09,865
Simon is only in danger
if they know where he is.

873
01:24:09,914 --> 01:24:14,988
They don't know where he is,
so he's not in danger, so you're
not in danger. All right?

874
01:24:15,034 --> 01:24:18,265
Right. Unless
there's an emergency.

875
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:25,153
- It's good to see you're keeping
your sense of humor about this.
- Yeah.

876
01:24:25,234 --> 01:24:30,183
I promise you I will be back in this
apartment at 2:00 tomorrow afternoon.

877
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:34,347
And I don't know how yet,
but I will make this up to you.

878
01:24:34,434 --> 01:24:36,504
Okay?
Thank you.

879
01:24:36,594 --> 01:24:39,313
Take care.

880
01:24:50,194 --> 01:24:54,551
I don't know if it qualifies
as a plan. I'm gonna fly there
and show them Leo's letter.

881
01:24:54,634 --> 01:24:57,592
Here's the bad news.

882
01:24:57,674 --> 01:25:01,030
You gotta get Simon into the
Witness Protection Program right away.

883
01:25:01,074 --> 01:25:04,225
Art, I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

884
01:25:04,274 --> 01:25:07,266
How do you expect me to authorize
a move like that?

885
01:25:07,314 --> 01:25:11,990
Lie, cheat. I don't give a shit. You
don't do it, that kid's as good as dead.

886
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:15,430
Has it occurred to you that maybe Kudrow
would shoot you on sight?

887
01:25:15,474 --> 01:25:17,863
Yeah, that has occurred
to me.

888
01:25:17,954 --> 01:25:21,344
If that happens,
you know what to do with these.

889
01:25:21,394 --> 01:25:24,466
Hope I see you later.

890
01:25:33,234 --> 01:25:35,509
Sandy!
So glad you could make it.

891
01:25:35,594 --> 01:25:40,190
Heard Ted had back surgery. Did you have
anything to do with that? Excuse me.

892
01:25:47,754 --> 01:25:49,585
Can I help you?

893
01:25:50,674 --> 01:25:52,983
Excuse me.
Nick, my good friend!

894
01:25:53,074 --> 01:25:56,987
I want you to know that
your Mercury thing is a goddamn triumph.

895
01:25:57,074 --> 01:25:59,269
- I mean that.
- I appreciate that, Senator.

896
01:25:59,314 --> 01:26:03,148
A feather in your cap. The Oversight
Committee is singing your praises.

897
01:26:03,234 --> 01:26:05,623
You're getting a reputation
as the "can do" guy.

898
01:26:05,714 --> 01:26:08,512
- Thank you. I do appreciate that.
- There's a guy outside.

899
01:26:08,594 --> 01:26:10,425
- Who?
- Says he's with the Bureau.

900
01:26:10,514 --> 01:26:13,267
Would you excuse me
one moment, please?

901
01:26:14,994 --> 01:26:17,906
If he wasn't Bureau,
I wouldn't have bothered you.

902
01:26:17,994 --> 01:26:20,269
I would've lost him,
but I didn't know, sir.

903
01:26:20,314 --> 01:26:23,192
No, Ted, you used good judgment.
I'd like to see him.

904
01:26:23,274 --> 01:26:25,105
He's not
very presentable.

905
01:26:25,194 --> 01:26:28,391
Bring him in the back way. Take him
to the wine cellar. I'll be down.

906
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:34,545
Nick, I can't believe you look so good
for someone so old!

907
01:26:34,634 --> 01:26:38,183
-How do you do that?
-Drugs, my dear. Massive doses of drugs.

908
01:26:38,234 --> 01:26:42,273
Please don't handle
the wine, Mr. Jeffries.

909
01:26:42,354 --> 01:26:45,710
Yes, I've read
your file.

910
01:26:47,514 --> 01:26:50,233
A deeply troubled F.B.I. agent
with a lousy record...

911
01:26:50,314 --> 01:26:52,225
kidnaps
a nine-year-old boy.

912
01:26:52,274 --> 01:26:54,230
Nice goin'.

913
01:26:54,314 --> 01:26:58,785
You come to my home in the middle
of a social function carrying a gun...

914
01:26:58,834 --> 01:27:02,270
to confront me with this fabricated
unsigned accusation...

915
01:27:02,354 --> 01:27:04,265
allegedly written
by Leo Pedranski...

916
01:27:04,314 --> 01:27:07,784
who was killed the day before yesterday
by you, for all I know.

917
01:27:07,834 --> 01:27:11,509
What do you want from me?
I'd like to get back to my guests.

918
01:27:11,594 --> 01:27:16,110
Unsigned accusation
was typed on carbon paper.

919
01:27:16,154 --> 01:27:18,224
Who uses that anymore?

920
01:27:18,314 --> 01:27:21,386
The late Leo Pedranski's
fingerprints were all over it.

921
01:27:23,634 --> 01:27:26,102
The Pomerello's
a little corky.

922
01:27:26,194 --> 01:27:30,312
I'm sure the Senate Oversight
Committee won't have any problem
connecting you to the murder.

923
01:27:30,354 --> 01:27:35,109
But you haven't given the carbon
to the Senate Oversight Committee.

924
01:27:35,154 --> 01:27:38,112
If you had, you wouldn't
be here right now.

925
01:27:38,194 --> 01:27:40,992
You've got your precious
carbon tucked away...

926
01:27:41,074 --> 01:27:43,463
guaranteeing your safety,
etcetera, etcetera...

927
01:27:43,554 --> 01:27:45,385
so you can come here
and demand what?

928
01:27:45,514 --> 01:27:48,551
Untold millions
in unmarked bills?

929
01:27:48,594 --> 01:27:51,791
I asked you
not to handle the wine, please.

930
01:27:51,834 --> 01:27:55,907
You know, it's good to see you got
your priorities in order.

931
01:27:57,874 --> 01:27:59,751
That's better.

932
01:27:59,794 --> 01:28:02,627
You're not worried about
murdering a nine-year-old boy...

933
01:28:02,674 --> 01:28:04,665
but you're worried about
this fucking wine?

934
01:28:04,754 --> 01:28:08,303
Here's the deal.

935
01:28:08,394 --> 01:28:11,431
I don't give the Senate
Oversight Committee the carbon.

936
01:28:11,474 --> 01:28:14,705
They don't waste three years with their
investigation, wailing and moaning...

937
01:28:14,794 --> 01:28:17,024
"How could this happen
in America?"...

938
01:28:17,074 --> 01:28:19,907
while you have one of
your spooks whack Simon Lynch.

939
01:28:19,954 --> 01:28:22,070
Or?

940
01:28:22,154 --> 01:28:25,430
Or you do the only thing that'll
guarantee Simon Lynch his safety.

941
01:28:25,514 --> 01:28:29,143
You or one of your superiors or
the president of the United States...

942
01:28:29,234 --> 01:28:31,225
I don't give a fuck who...

943
01:28:31,314 --> 01:28:33,953
but someone is gonna go on
national television and tell America...

944
01:28:34,034 --> 01:28:37,026
that your billion dollar,
uncrackable code...

945
01:28:37,074 --> 01:28:39,793
has been cracked by
a nine-year-old autistic boy.

946
01:28:39,834 --> 01:28:41,825
Then you get
your carbon back.

947
01:28:46,994 --> 01:28:50,111
You know what I think,
Mr. Jeffries?

948
01:28:50,194 --> 01:28:54,585
I think you've seen too many of those
four-wheel drive commercials on TV.

949
01:28:56,754 --> 01:28:59,473
The ones where you get to drive fast
and be a renegade.

950
01:28:59,514 --> 01:29:02,233
Let's talk about
the real world...

951
01:29:02,314 --> 01:29:06,705
where you're not some wonderful lone
wolf hero, but you're part of a team.

952
01:29:06,794 --> 01:29:10,673
And you play your position
because that's what America is.

953
01:29:10,754 --> 01:29:13,393
It's one big team.

954
01:29:13,434 --> 01:29:18,554
This might be difficult
for you to grasp, but I am a patriot.

955
01:29:18,634 --> 01:29:22,673
And a patriot is one who makes
the right moral choice.

956
01:29:22,714 --> 01:29:26,229
Sometimes it takes a strong man
to make that choice.

957
01:29:26,314 --> 01:29:31,183
One boy who cannot survive on his own,
one of nature's mistakes...

958
01:29:31,274 --> 01:29:34,505
weighed against the lives
of thousands of our people.

959
01:29:34,594 --> 01:29:37,062
Think about it.
You worked undercover.

960
01:29:37,154 --> 01:29:40,703
How many of our agents will
be put in harm's way
if this code is compromised?

961
01:29:40,754 --> 01:29:42,790
Members of your team.

962
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:45,428
Men like Rasheed Halabi...

963
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:48,711
an lraqi-American
and a great patriot.

964
01:29:48,754 --> 01:29:52,542
A man, who as we speak, is undercover
in Saddam's Republican Guard.

965
01:29:52,594 --> 01:29:55,506
A man who has not seen
his family--

966
01:29:57,554 --> 01:30:00,546
That's for Simon's parents,
you piece of shit.

967
01:30:02,234 --> 01:30:04,145
You got 36 hours.

968
01:30:04,234 --> 01:30:07,988
Should be enough time to get your
undercover people out of harm's way.

969
01:30:10,674 --> 01:30:14,587
Oh, by the way.
Happy birthday, Nick.

970
01:30:26,194 --> 01:30:29,550
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

971
01:30:30,554 --> 01:30:32,431
Yeah.
You all right?

972
01:30:32,474 --> 01:30:35,546
Yeah, I'm all right. How'd it go
with the witness protection thing?

973
01:30:35,634 --> 01:30:38,512
Everything's set.
Tomorrow night, 8:15...

974
01:30:38,594 --> 01:30:40,505
U.S. marshalls are gonna meet us
with a chopper...

975
01:30:40,594 --> 01:30:43,427
at the heliport on top
of the G.E.X. building.

976
01:30:43,474 --> 01:30:45,465
I took your advice.
I lied.

977
01:30:45,554 --> 01:30:48,671
All right. Good.
See you then. Bye.

978
01:30:50,674 --> 01:30:53,108
That was recorded
on passive V.O.X...

979
01:30:53,194 --> 01:30:56,186
at Agent Jordan's
residence at 11:58 p.m.

980
01:30:56,274 --> 01:30:59,152
As to the pickup, since we can assume
the boy will not be alone...

981
01:30:59,194 --> 01:31:03,107
I suggest we wait until
we get him on the chopper.

982
01:31:03,554 --> 01:31:05,704
Saw them do this in the movies.

983
01:31:07,914 --> 01:31:10,667
How are you, laddie boy?

984
01:31:17,314 --> 01:31:19,305
Oh, damn!

985
01:31:19,354 --> 01:31:22,744
Simon, turn it down, please!

986
01:31:22,834 --> 01:31:24,870
Hello?

987
01:31:24,914 --> 01:31:27,064
Hello?

988
01:31:28,114 --> 01:31:30,469
Hello?

989
01:31:40,154 --> 01:31:42,065
How much I owe you?

990
01:31:42,154 --> 01:31:44,588
- Twenty dollars, sir.
- Here. Thanks a lot.

991
01:31:52,594 --> 01:31:54,471
Stacey?

992
01:31:57,394 --> 01:31:59,385
Stacey?

993
01:32:03,754 --> 01:32:05,665
Shit!

994
01:32:15,474 --> 01:32:19,706
- Hello?
- Tommy, where are they now?

995
01:32:19,794 --> 01:32:22,149
Relax. Simon and the girl
are fine. I talked to 'em.

996
01:32:22,194 --> 01:32:24,105
She said she got spooked.
Someone called.

997
01:32:24,194 --> 01:32:28,426
- When she picked up the phone
the line was dead.
- It was me from the airplane.

998
01:32:28,474 --> 01:32:32,831
- Told 'em when Witness Protection
is gonna pick 'em up?
- Absolutely.

999
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:35,189
She's gonna meet us there.
Everything's set.

1000
01:32:35,274 --> 01:32:37,788
Listen, I gotta go.

1001
01:32:41,114 --> 01:32:42,991
Agent Jordan.

1002
01:32:43,074 --> 01:32:46,987
Lieutenant Colonel Kudrow
of the N.S.A.

1003
01:32:47,034 --> 01:32:49,502
What am I looking at here,
Tommy?

1004
01:32:49,554 --> 01:32:52,751
You forged documents to obtain witness
protection under false pretenses.

1005
01:32:52,834 --> 01:32:57,988
Don't listen to anything this guy
tells you. This guy is dangerous.

1006
01:32:58,034 --> 01:33:00,070
Tommy, sit down,
and don't speak.

1007
01:33:07,794 --> 01:33:10,103
Agent Jordan...

1008
01:33:10,194 --> 01:33:12,549
regardless of what
you think of me...

1009
01:33:12,594 --> 01:33:15,472
I only want to resolve
this situation to rescue a young boy...

1010
01:33:15,514 --> 01:33:17,982
from a delusional kidnapper.

1011
01:33:18,034 --> 01:33:20,673
We will proceed
with the pickup as planned.

1012
01:33:20,754 --> 01:33:23,473
As of this moment,
the F.B.I. will stand down...

1013
01:33:23,554 --> 01:33:26,944
and the N.S.A.
will take over from here.

1014
01:33:26,994 --> 01:33:29,064
Gentlemen.

1015
01:33:36,434 --> 01:33:38,868
- Chief, take a look at this.
- I'm not taking a look.

1016
01:33:38,954 --> 01:33:43,744
You have to look at this! Leo Pedranski
worked for Kudrow. He wrote that letter.

1017
01:33:43,794 --> 01:33:46,069
He was also killed
after he wrote it.

1018
01:33:46,154 --> 01:33:49,430
I ran it through the lab.
And the fingerprints on it
are an exact match for his.

1019
01:33:59,954 --> 01:34:01,865
Up.

1020
01:34:01,954 --> 01:34:04,787
That's where we're goin',
Simon.

1021
01:34:06,954 --> 01:34:08,785
Come on.

1022
01:34:34,994 --> 01:34:37,713
Is that you, Art?

1023
01:34:40,114 --> 01:34:43,550
I'm a United States marshall
with the Witness Protection Program.

1024
01:34:44,714 --> 01:34:47,512
How do you do?

1025
01:34:47,594 --> 01:34:49,824
Good.

1026
01:34:52,514 --> 01:34:54,425
You must be Simon.

1027
01:34:54,514 --> 01:34:57,233
Chopper on approach, sir.

1028
01:34:57,314 --> 01:34:59,782
Why don't you come
with me, son?

1029
01:34:59,834 --> 01:35:02,348
- No!
- He doesn't like
to be touched by strangers.

1030
01:35:02,394 --> 01:35:05,386
I'll take him.

1031
01:35:05,434 --> 01:35:08,744
Come on, Simon.
Let's go see the helicopter.

1032
01:35:10,794 --> 01:35:14,343
- I thought Art was supposed
to meet us here.
- There's been a change in plans.

1033
01:35:14,394 --> 01:35:17,670
But I want to assure you
that your country owes you
the greatest debt of gratitude.

1034
01:35:17,714 --> 01:35:20,990
Chopper coming in!
Don't have much time!

1035
01:35:22,834 --> 01:35:26,543
For the safety of the boy, you should
go home now and forget you were here.

1036
01:35:29,554 --> 01:35:32,864
Okay, Simon, you're gonna go for a ride
in the helicopter.

1037
01:35:32,914 --> 01:35:34,791
Good-bye, Simon.

1038
01:35:36,754 --> 01:35:38,790
You can go with him.

1039
01:35:58,674 --> 01:36:00,505
Tommy.

1040
01:36:00,594 --> 01:36:03,108
They're on the helipad,
and the chopper's coming in.

1041
01:36:03,154 --> 01:36:05,031
You have a green light.
Go, go, go, go!

1042
01:36:05,074 --> 01:36:06,871
- It's a go. Let's move.
- Go, go!

1043
01:36:10,834 --> 01:36:12,392
Hold them back!

1044
01:36:18,674 --> 01:36:21,063
Stay down!
Stay down!

1045
01:36:30,874 --> 01:36:34,310
No! No!

1046
01:36:37,634 --> 01:36:39,909
No!

1047
01:37:09,594 --> 01:37:11,505
No! No! Simon!

1048
01:37:34,234 --> 01:37:37,624
Let me go. Come on!

1049
01:37:37,714 --> 01:37:42,185
No! No!
No, Simon, no!

1050
01:38:05,834 --> 01:38:08,906
Get up. Get up, get up.

1051
01:38:08,954 --> 01:38:11,024
That's right.

1052
01:38:37,754 --> 01:38:40,063
- Tommy, no! Hold 'em back!
- Hold your fire!

1053
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:43,390
Keep 'em back now!

1054
01:38:44,474 --> 01:38:47,591
No!

1055
01:39:18,634 --> 01:39:20,465
Where's the team leader?

1056
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:25,150
- Right here, Agent Jeffries.
- It's Kudrow's piece. I got a
nine-millimeter on the sidewalk.

1057
01:39:25,234 --> 01:39:27,065
I'll take care of it.

1058
01:40:02,354 --> 01:40:07,030
Let's see what you got.

1059
01:40:07,114 --> 01:40:09,070
- I want you to say "bug."
- Bug.

1060
01:40:09,114 --> 01:40:12,948
Can you look at me?
Bug.

1061
01:40:13,034 --> 01:40:14,945
- Bug.
- That's very good.

1062
01:40:14,994 --> 01:40:17,110
I like that very much.

1063
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:25,345
Can I help you?

1064
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:28,545
I'm Art Jeffries,
a friend of Simon Lynch.

1065
01:40:28,594 --> 01:40:32,507
Yes, I know. His foster parents
told me all about you.

1066
01:40:32,594 --> 01:40:34,425
How's he doing?

1067
01:40:34,514 --> 01:40:38,712
He's fine.
He's adjusted very well.

1068
01:40:39,754 --> 01:40:41,710
Do you want
to say hello?

1069
01:40:41,794 --> 01:40:44,752
He probably wouldn't
remember me.

1070
01:40:44,794 --> 01:40:48,992
I was told...
not to expect too much.

1071
01:40:49,074 --> 01:40:53,113
I brought him some puzzles.

Do you think you could give
these to him, please?

1073
01:40:55,434 --> 01:40:59,791
Sure, but I think it would
be better for Simon if you did.

1074
01:40:59,834 --> 01:41:01,904
It's okay.
Come on.

Thank you.

Hey, Simon.

1077
01:41:15,954 --> 01:41:18,514
How you doin', partner?

1078
01:41:21,674 --> 01:41:26,304
I brought you some new puzzles.
You might like those.

Hey, Simon, look at me.

1080
01:41:34,994 --> 01:41:38,111
Look at me, Simon.
Look in my eyes.

1081
01:41:39,154 --> 01:41:41,588
Look in my eyes.

1082
01:41:45,154 --> 01:41:47,384
It's me, Art.
