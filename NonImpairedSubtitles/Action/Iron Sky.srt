00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,161
<i>Control, this is Liberty.

00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:50,161
<i>Roger that. Be advised,
radio static on the com. </i>

00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:55,530
<i>Roger that.
7-10 plus VGX, landing window is up.</i>

00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:59,492
<i>Landing vector approved...
Engage the bay.</i>

00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:26,892
<i>- Landing is confirmed, Liberty.

<i> 2, 1. </i>

16
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:07,765
<i> Now lets, uh, drop the banners.</i>

17
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:11,307
<i>  Oh, fu...
Must we?</i>

18
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:18,353
<i> - The Eagle has landed, baby.
- Please, keep that fool off the main frequency.</i>

19
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:23,350
<i> Are you getting a reading
there, Sanders?</i>

20
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:27,556
Mission control, I can confirm
vast quantities of Helium-3.

21
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:30,857
<i> - The reading are stronger this way.
- What? You breaking up...</i>

22
00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:33,861
<i>Please be advices you may be
nearing meteor shower...</i>

23
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,800
<i>Adjust communicate...
frequency...</i>

24
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:39,919
No fucking way!

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,856
Hey, Sand, what you doin'
with that thing hopping around over there?

26
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,591
I thought you were supposed to take
some photos of me?

27
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,705
- Washington, have you got a visual on...
- What was that, Houston?

28
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:11,159
- Hey, Washington, it's Helium-3.
- What?

29
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,384
It's a Helium-3 mine.
Get over here!

30
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,022
Hey, there's something over here
you need to see!

31
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,079
No! Sanders!
Sanders! San...ah!

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,565
Oh, God!

33
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:37,461
<i> Houston, Houston!Son-of-a-bitch.
I need to get out of here.</i>

34
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,300
I must be trippin'.

36
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:42,652
Sieg Heil, Moon youth führer,
Renate Richter.

37
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,000
Heil Hitler.

38
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:48,489
Boys and girls,
please sit down.

39
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:53,333
Dieter, don't you know
where to put your behind?

40
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,209
Miss. Richter, since Mondführer's
65th birthday

41
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,558
te appropriate salute has been
"Heil Kortzfleisch!"

42
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:05,101
You're such an exemplary boy.

43
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:11,043
Today we'll start with the most
unpatriotic language.

44
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,387
It's the language
we unfortunately need to know

45
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:18,274
when we return to those
who need our help.

46
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:20,933
In english now.

47
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:25,141
Where are we from?

48
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:28,020
- Siegfried!
- The Earth.

49
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:30,761
And, when did we leave?

50
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:33,448
- Brunhilda?
- 1945.

51
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,240
- And where did we go?
- The dark side of the moon.

52
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,861
Brilliant!

53
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:06,039
Attention!
The National Anthem.

54
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,600
- Heil Hitler!
- Hitler...

55
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:56,168
- What's that, Mr. Adler?
- A spy from the earth.

56
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:58,290
I captured him myself.

57
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,272
He seems to he
the leader of the shock troops.

58
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:24,162
Mr. Adler, is this a joke?

59
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:27,050
I'll be damned!

60
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,360
The White House
Washington D. C.

61
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,654
Don't try to play dumb with me.

62
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,925
It was your bad idea to send
those idiots to the moon?

63
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:40,917
- Talk about disaster. - I'm not
to be contrarian madam President

64
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:43,072
but I'm pretty sure
it was your idea.

65
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,849
It was my great idea if have they succeeded.
Now it's your stupid idea, got it?

66
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,866
I didn't hire you for stupid ideas.
I hired you because of your Midas touch.

67
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:55,928
Now my approval ratings are in the toilet
and the election is just weeks...

68
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,990
You dropped the ball, Vivian!
You!

69
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:02,543
Now, I need a miracle.
Get me a miracle!

70
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:12,050
Actually, how was sending those
two astronauts to the Moon,

71
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,895
supposed to getting me re-elected?
Exactly?

72
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:17,300
We haven't been to the Moon
for 50 years.

73
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,297
One of them was black.

74
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,850
Thought it would look good.

75
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,755
Look good how?

76
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,566
Like I said, one of them was black.

77
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:31,085
Just think of the opportunity we wasted years 
ago with that errand boy, Powell, Alan Powell?

78
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,338
- Colin Powell.
- That was close.

79
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:38,034
- And where're you going?
- The UN, to do my job.

80
00:08:49,015 --> 00:08:51,824
"The Great Dictator"
by Charlie Chaplin.

81
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,242
It's one of the world
most famous short films.

82
00:08:55,243 --> 00:09:00,783
Which illustrates in just 10 minutes,
his wish that one day, the entire world

83
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:04,956
that will be held in the great Führer's
wise and gentle hands.

84
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:07,662
- Any questions?
- I have a question.

85
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,500
My sweetheart.

86
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,500
Mr. Adler.

87
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:18,244
In my classroom we are here to strictly
formal manner in addressing one another.

88
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:22,393
To what do we owe the honor
of this visit?

89
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:25,033
Mr. Nachrichten übermittlungs-
Oberführer Adler?

90
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,684
We captured an earthling.
Your expertise is required.

91
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:42,536
- What's for lunch today?
- Sauerkraut.

92
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:45,521
Again! Please say
that's not true!

93
00:09:45,722 --> 00:09:49,021
Does the Fuhrer eat Sauerkraut
3 times a week as well?

94
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:53,488
No, no no!
I love me some sauerkraut.

95
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:57,638
And Volkswagen.
Huh...Fahrvergnügen.

96
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,664
Hey! German words, right?

97
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:05,394
You know, it's as if, where I come from
we speak German too. You know what I'm sayin'?

98
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,747
Damn! You gonna be sorry
you did that white boy.

99
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:20,073
Capture him! No!
Capture him!

100
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,034
Do not shoot!

101
00:10:56,651 --> 00:11:01,650
The fugitive is a male negro,
unarmed, but possibly angry.

102
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:04,202
How does he look like?

103
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:08,410
Where does he come from?
What is he wearing?

104
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:12,358
How do I look?

105
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,267
Like they say in English...

106
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:18,940
you are a knock-out.

107
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,224
How do I get out of here?

108
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,391
Thanks lady.
Have a nice day.

109
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,500
No, Mr. Subhuman.
That is the air lock...

110
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:36,329
No!

111
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,330
No!

112
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:25,827
You might wanna...
cover up a bit.

113
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,339
All good?

114
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:35,169
Klaus! Don't shoot.
We need him for tests...

115
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,270
No, no, no! I would not do if I was you.
Listen to me. Listen to me!

116
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:42,170
I know a lot of important people.
They're very important people.

117
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:44,750
I even know the President
of the United States of America.

118
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:48,264
Now...if you kill me, then that's just a
really fucked-up situation.

119
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:55,233
You know the president of the
United States of the Americas?

120
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:03,379
- Take him to Dr. Richter's laboratory!
- By your command!

121
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:08,337
Thanks, homie.
I talk to you later baby.

122
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,882
Question, what is this apparatus?

123
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,452
Look man, how would I know?
I'm just model.

124
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:30,402
- A model what? Citizen?
- No man, a model model.

125
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:33,198
Damn, what's wrong with you two?
Blind or something?

126
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:36,227
-Shit, I'm pretty.
-Are you part of the shock troops

127
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:41,090
- before the invasion?
- Invasion? Man, you all must be tripping?

128
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:43,819
What is your mission?

129
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,050
Look dude, I just follow the paycheck,
you know what I'm saying?

130
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,555
-What is this device?
-That's my kick-ass cellphone

131
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:55,158
-and a computer.
-What?

132
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,428
That's not a computer.

133
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,177
This is a computer.

134
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:13,344
No man. That's ancient
history, homie.

135
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,740
Dumb negro.

136
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,036
- He talks nonsense.
- It might be a dialect.

137
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:21,606
- Probable reason is the skin color.
- Right.

138
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:26,596
His brain structure is
different from us Aryans.

139
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:31,863
Let's open up his skull
and measure the brain.

140
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:34,547
No, I need to know why he's here.

141
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:38,914
You have 24 hours, Doctor.

142
00:14:39,606 --> 00:14:43,683
Otherwise I have to rely on
an ancient infallible technique.

143
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,819
Pain.

144
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:50,500
UNITED WORLD CONFEDERACY,
NEW YORK

145
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,399
I am telling you once again.

146
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:57,761
One moment we received conformation
that the ship has landed successfully on the moon.

147
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:00,801
The next, all communications stopped.

148
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:04,627
- As though it had simply vanished.
- Or you're hiding something from us?

149
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:08,345
Yeah, we are hiding something
on the dark side of the moon.

150
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:15,468
I still find it very difficult to believe
that the entire purpose of the mission

151
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,352
was to promote your president's
re-election.

152
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:22,008
Well believe what you like, we had
mere senators spend

153
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:26,352
hundred-of-million on campaigns
to get elected to dog-shit post.

154
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:30,102
But Mr. Secretary, the expenses
involve this time only makes sense

155
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,948
if there was a military purpose.

156
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,338
Okay, let's get this clear.

157
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,787
The United State has no
military activity on the Moon.

158
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,506
What about natural resources activity?

159
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,434
We know how the U.S. sometimes
mixes the two up.

160
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:48,430
Is there any chance that you are
looking for Helium-3 up there?

161
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:52,660
Helium-3? You just made that up,
didn't you?

162
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:56,123
That's so silly.

163
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:01,823
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HQ,
NY

164
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,432
I assume these are
just preliminary idea?

165
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:21,325
Sir, we have a very small
delivery window.

166
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:23,255
- Sir?
- Yes, sir.

167
00:16:24,407 --> 00:16:27,401
Ma'am, and this is all.

168
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:41,135
Anyone who is not the
head of the department, should leave.

169
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:52,279
You idiots!

170
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,736
You morons!
That's an insult to morons.

171
00:16:57,514 --> 00:17:00,560
What is this shit?

172
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:07,781
I have a meeting with the President
of the United fucking States of the America

173
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,625
tomorrow fucking morning!

174
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:13,062
Not the President
of fucking Zambia!

175
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:16,143
Not the President of
the fucking Janitor's Union!

176
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:20,744
But with the president of the fucking country which
you just happen to be living in at the fucking moment!

177
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:25,204
You pieces of hellacious shit!

178
00:17:29,535 --> 00:17:32,280
What am I supposed to tell her?

179
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:37,998
That my employees
are not intelligent enough,

180
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,622
to be fucking morons?

181
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:11,297
- Mr. Adler.
- Call me Klaus.

182
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,431
- May I?
- Of course.

183
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:25,102
I've come to discuss
our legal union.

184
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:31,748
- Is that a marriage proposal?
- There's no need for marriage.

185
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:35,896
I received the confirmation of
the Department of Racial Purity.

186
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:41,894
Our genetic match is 97%.

187
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:44,911
How romantic.

188
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:49,385
Science demands us
to unite physically.

189
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:54,783
It's our destiny to produce
perfect offspring for the people.

190
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:59,880
What about my scientific research?

191
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:06,828
One day, Renate...

192
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:11,819
all this will be ours.

193
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:17,480
But first, I must conquer
the Earth.

194
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,337
Wolfgang, that old fart,
stands in my way.

195
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:23,750
In the way of final victory.

196
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:28,141
The two of us will take on
an enormous responsibility.

197
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:32,715
Your place is, Renate,
by my side.

198
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:50,351
Gentlemen!
Battleship Götterdämmerung.

199
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,600
Our miracle weapon that has been
under development for 40 years.

200
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,124
The dream of our beloved Führer.

201
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:04,813
But unfortunately only a dream,
until now.

202
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:08,900
- Please Doctor.
- Watch this!

203
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,508
This tiny device

204
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:19,654
has over a 1000 times more computing
power than our biggest computers together.

205
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:23,616
I engineered this cable

206
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:28,399
to connect this machine
with our main computer.

207
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:34,068
I call this Universal
Systematic Binding USB for short.

208
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,933
This will lift it into the air.

209
00:20:38,968 --> 00:20:43,660
Finally, the Götterdämmerung
will fly!

210
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:47,637
- Yes.
- Yes.

211
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:40,189
You saw it!
You saw it with your own eyes!

212
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:45,497
Mein Führer, please
let me return to the Earth.

213
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,317
Let me get more of these devices.

214
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:51,577
No one has ever returned.

215
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,722
I will return.

216
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:55,686
We don't have a choice

217
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,586
if we want to prevent
an invasion from the Earth.

218
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:06,598
<i>Are you willing to work
with the Führer...</i>

219
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,842
<i>in the name of the fatherland,
stand behind the Wehrmacht.</i>

220
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:14,281
<i>This decision does not
resolve all of us ...</i>

221
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:22,962
Thank you.
I thought my ears were gonna bleed.

222
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:24,722
You're welcome.

223
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:40,967
May I ask what's your name is?

224
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,412
Washington,
James Washington.

225
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,108
- What's yours?
- Renate Richter.

226
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:49,770
It is a pleasure to meet you,
Washington.

227
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,846
James Washington.

228
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:55,768
What's wrong with your skin?

229
00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:00,281
Come on now, please. You have
never met a brother before, right?

230
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:05,572
- No, I'm an only child.
- No, no, I didn't mean like that.

231
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,781
I meant a black man.

232
00:23:07,982 --> 00:23:11,489
No, and this continues to confuse me

233
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:15,034
because you are much blacker
when I first encountered you.

234
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:19,273
Okay girl look, either I'm black
or you're blind.

235
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,260
Look, what is going
to happen to me?

236
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,300
I mean, what's with this, this guy
that keeps sticking needles in me?

237
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,542
- What about that other angry dude?
- My father's sticking needles into you?

238
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:31,442
That's freaking scientist guy?
That's your dad?

239
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:34,390
And what about, you know....?

240
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:38,439
Mr. Nachrichtenübermittlungs
-Oberführer Adler?

241
0 0:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,636
-I'm sorry, what?
- Klaus Adler.

242
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:44,615
He's going to be
the next fuhrer.

243
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:48,063
And my husband.

244
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:52,887
What? You lose a bet or
something? I mean....

245
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:56,689
you are...lucky you.

246
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,690
Actually, lucky him.

247
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:09,256
- I shouldn't even be here.
- You cannot leave me tied up like this.

248
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:13,407
- Please do me a favor.
- What?

249
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:15,928
- Play a Nazi
- And what, if I don't?

250
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:20,674
- They will eliminate you.
- Oh great!

251
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:26,746
Is there a different radio station?

252
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:29,673
<i>With the upcoming war ...</i>

253
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,752
- He's back.
- Looks good.

254
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:39,087
This will solve our
little problem.

255
00:24:39,088 --> 00:24:42,715
Okay, mini Mengele.
Hey man, I don't like the look of this.

256
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:44,616
I am coming.

257
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:50,561
Looks very good.

258
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:54,449
And now we just...

259
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:08,425
- Why do not you take me with you?
- Don't worry, darling.

260
00:25:08,426 --> 00:25:11,098
After I complete my mission,
I come back to you.

261
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:14,635
That's not what I mean.
I'm an Earthologist!

262
00:25:14,636 --> 00:25:18,816
I know everything about it.
You need me.

263
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:23,000
You sweet little thing, where do you
get all those crazy ideas?

264
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,361
Books, mostly...

265
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:29,000
and some films.

266
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,068
I shall return triumphant!

267
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,233
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Kortzfleisch!

268
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:08,851
- Get it through your skull.
- Of course, mein Führer.

269
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:13,206
We have one more
ace up our sleeve.

270
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,024
Show him what we have.

271
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,669
Voila, gentlemen!

272
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,004
- Doctor.
- Watch closely.

273
00:26:36,102 --> 00:26:37,828
Heil!

274
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,057
Stand up, you fool.

275
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,955
Sieg Heil!

276
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:09,974
With the prisoner now being
one of us, we will go down to Earth.

277
00:27:10,018 --> 00:27:14,219
He will help us to find more
telephone computers. We return.

278
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,374
And then get the
Götterdämmerung flying.

279
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:20,900
Oberführer Adler,
I hope you've discussed

280
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,189
my return to the Earth.

281
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:27,042
Something along those lines.

282
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:31,000
The Reich trusts you.

283
00:27:33,688 --> 00:27:37,359
- Thank you, doctor.Take care
of your daughter for me. - Yes.

284
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:51,621
Sieg Heil!

285
00:27:59,987 --> 00:28:03,412
See you in Valhalla.

286
00:28:27,884 --> 00:28:31,401
UPSTATE,  NEW YORK

287
00:28:55,186 --> 00:28:59,347
- You smell that?
- No. We don’t have time to waste.

288
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:02,333
Take me to that president of yours.

289
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:05,282
What? The President?

290
00:29:05,783 --> 00:29:09,463
Come on man, I thought you want me
to take you to Mac store or something.

291
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:16,969
You said that you would know the President
of The United States of the Americas.

292
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,655
Right, of course.

293
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:22,200
That President.

294
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:32,929
May I meet this President too?

295
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,848
Renate! What are you doing here?

296
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:39,450
Hey, Miss. Richter,
welcome to my planet.

297
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:43,404
This is not the place for the mother
of the children of the future Führer.

298
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:46,416
And definitely not the place
for a woman.

299
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:54,528
My place is by my man.

300
00:29:59,084 --> 00:30:02,494
- Get the hell out of my property.
- We better get out of here!

301
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,650
Run for it!

302
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,145
New York City

303
00:30:23,464 --> 00:30:26,042
A Volkswagen bus.

304
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:29,725
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now, hold on there Boss man.

305
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,002
That may not be the sharpest move.
Look, look. I'll tell you what.

306
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:37,749
Let me go talk to the brothers. All right?
They know me, you know. I'm one of them.

307
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,563
Are you with me?

308
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,018
Yeah! Yeah!
Now you're talking.

309
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:45,474
All right, now.

310
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
Wassup?

311
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,023
- Doesn't he know?
- No. He'll be thrilled.

312
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:58,724
I'm serious. You don't know how good
it's to see you all man.  It's like...

313
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,724
- little Africa up in this bitch.
- Thank you.

314
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,888
Come on people. You all know me.
I know you do.

315
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,000
- Washington.
- I mean ...

316
00:31:08,195 --> 00:31:11,800
That ain't one of yours, is it?
Because...ah, look man.

317
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:13,501
You ain't got to
bring that shit out.

318
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:15,952
Look man, it's all good.
Look, I'm a peace loving brother, man.

319
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,383
Fuck it, man!
Yo! Yo!

320
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,600
Are you all right?

321
00:31:25,731 --> 00:31:28,931
Do I fucking look alright to you
Miss crazy fucking Nazi?

322
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:31,634
I mean...
What the hell just happen?

323
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:33,350
You know?

324
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:42,957
Oh, no mother-effin way!

325
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:52,051
What did you sick
sons-a-bitches do to me?

326
00:31:52,088 --> 00:31:55,382
- I should've told you. - What?
That I look like a fucking polar bear?

327
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:59,935
You know what? You two really, really
know how to fuck up a guys Christmas.

328
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:03,652
Quiet, you fool!
What is wrong with you?

329
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,850
We made you Aryan,
you're one of us now.

330
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,305
- You should be thanking us.
- Thanking you?

331
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:13,389
What I should have done is let those
brother come here with their size 15s

332
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,880
and put a foot so far up in your ass,
can taste the toe nails for 2 fucking weeks.

333
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,624
Klaus!

334
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,203
Bring me to your leader,
James Washington.

335
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:43,725
Hey, what the fuck?
Excuse me.

336
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,502
Get your fucking hands off me,
you mother...

337
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:51,015
- You can...- Is she your boss?
- Yes, she's the big cheese.

338
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:53,715
- And she knows the president?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. They real tight.

339
00:32:57,695 --> 00:32:59,158
Come on.

340
00:33:01,497 --> 00:33:05,500
You fuckin' animal!
Do you know who I am, huh? Do you?

341
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,621
You just kidnapped the wrong woman
The wrong fucking woman.

342
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:13,735
Oh yeah. I hope you're having a good time
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

343
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:26,969
Excellent.

344
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,994
My turn.

345
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:34,000
I am Commander Klaus Adler of the 4th Reich
We are based on the Moon.

346
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm told you know the president
of the United States of the Americas.

347
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:40,811
You will take us to that
the President, because ...

348
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:44,611
- I have a very special present for him.
- Him?

349
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:47,100
Well he'll love that.
He just loves presents.

350
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,955
As soon as my mission is accomplished

351
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,947
Nazi invading forces
will be called in under my directions
352
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,500
and we will end the good
times for the bad people.

353
00:33:55,552 --> 00:33:57,882
And just how do you propose
to do that?

354
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,550
- We will simply eliminate them.
- What?

355
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:07,287
- Sorry, that is not what we were told...
- Renate, I do not think that you...

356
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:15,083
Yeah. Why not?

357
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:19,867
Why don't you tell this fräulein why
we're here, just like you keep telling your pupils.

358
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,393
I would love to do that.

359
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,874
You see...

360
00:34:25,052 --> 00:34:28,300
the National Socialist Party
is the people's party, nothing more.

361
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,017
We wish to return to Earth
with our message of peace and unity

362
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:37,008
love through virtue.

363
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:40,251
And kindness, for example.

364
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:44,120
We are healthy,
in mind and body.

365
00:34:44,202 --> 00:34:48,081
Our spirits are brave and true.

366
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:53,398
We achieved that because we are strong,
disciplined in our cause.

367
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:57,164
There is simply no belief
that can match ours...

368
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:02,654
because peace and unity is the gift
that we bring to all mankind.

369
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:08,860
- What you and all earthlings need to know ...
- Yeah, yeah. I get it.

370
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,485
This is good.

371
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,004
This is gonna work.

372
00:35:18,255 --> 00:35:20,901
You, I need.

373
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:24,350
And you...

374
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,942
I want.

375
00:35:27,195 --> 00:35:30,364
Alright, let's go meet the president.

376
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:53,000
Madam President ...

377
00:35:54,075 --> 00:35:56,400
here is the miracle
you asked for.

378
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:19,163
- Who is this man?
- He will lead the campaign troops.

379
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:30,636
Renate, please...

380
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:37,854
It's very simple.

381
00:36:38,605 --> 00:36:40,281
The world is sick...

382
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,476
and we are the doctors.

383
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:47,600
The world has anemic
and we are the vitamin.

384
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,500
The world is weary,
but we are the strength.

385
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:55,582
We are here to make
the world healthy once again.

386
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:57,537
With hard work...

387
00:36:58,251 --> 00:37:02,700
with honesty, with clarity,
with decency.

388
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:10,666
We are the product of
loving mothers and brave fathers.

389
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:16,878
We are the embodiment
of love and bravery.

390
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:22,710
We are the gift of both
God and science.

391
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,300
We are the answer to the question.

392
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:31,214
We are the promise delivered
to all mankind.

393
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,250
For that we raise our hand,
to one nation.

394
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,189
We step to the beat of one drum

395
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:42,600
We march to the beat of one heart
on this world.

396
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,310
We are the people who will carry
the children on our shoulders.

397
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:51,556
In the same way as our fathers carried
us and their fathers before them.

398
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:56,173
We are the one people united
and strong.

399
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:01,302
We are the one people with certainty.
Moral certainty.

400
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:05,611
We are invincible
and we have no fear.

401
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:12,200
Because the truth makes us one.

402
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
THREE MONTHS LATER

403
00:38:28,177 --> 00:38:31,939
The moon Nazis are coming. What's wrong
with you people, can't you see?

404
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:33,949
Look, I've been there.
I'm telling you.

405
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:38,100
They have all this moon base, they got this whole
like space thing goin' on, and they comin' to take over.

406
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,850
Oh, you never listen to this right?
Listen now 'cause they comin, they comin'.

407
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:46,650
They coming to get us all. Why
aren't you guys listening to me? I mean...

408
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:50,769
Renate.

409
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,360
Washington.
James Washington.

410
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,500
- I'm so glad to see you alive.
- Is that you? 

411
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,801
Yeah!

412
00:38:56,897 --> 00:39:00,100
Look I got one! This is the bitch 
that made me white as a fuckin' snowflake.

413
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,900
Come on people, help me!

414
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,444
Help me!

415
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:16,915
I saved your life.

416
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:26,072
So, you're a formerly
dead, black model...

417
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:28,859
who is now suddenly
a living white hobo

418
00:39:28,919 --> 00:39:33,200
after spending a weekend
on the Moon. Is that correct?

419
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,026
- Yes, that's correct.
- Huh, so I was listening.

420
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:42,650
And you're Neil Armstrong after
his sex change operation. Is this correct?

421
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,377
No, that is not correct.
You were not listening at all.

422
00:39:46,837 --> 00:39:49,304
My name is Richter.
Renate Richter.

423
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:54,705
I tried to save this man's life and
I think he's stupid, childish and ungrateful.

424
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:59,742
Okay. Ask Miss. Moon-Nazi here, was I,
or was I not on the dark side of the Moon.

425
00:40:02,007 --> 00:40:05,400
Yes, Mr. James Washington was
on the dark side of the Moon.

426
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,700
There, what did I tell you.

427
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,600
I am black, but now I'm white. I went to
the dark side of the moon, but I'm now back.

428
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,430
And the Nazis are coming to kill us all.

429
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,504
And you guys are gonna so sorry
that you didn't listened to me.

430
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,402
Mr. James Washington,
why are you so upset? So angry?

431
00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:30,447
- Get lost.
- But I don't understand.

432
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:33,057
I mean...we made you white.

433
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:36,864
We taught you about National Socialists
message, about peace and unity.

434
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,281
You people have robbed me of everything.

435
00:40:40,347 --> 00:40:43,010
My race, my identity, my career.

436
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:47,132
And I'm beginning to think I am flipping
mind too. I mean just everything.

437
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:49,494
Do you know this?

438
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:51,847
Yes.

439
00:40:52,544 --> 00:40:54,096
Wonderful.

440
00:40:54,097 --> 00:40:55,397
Come on.

441
00:40:55,884 --> 00:40:59,509
Come on in. I will explain it to you
then you'll understand it.

442
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:05,181
You're a one strange broad.
I'll give you that.

443
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,630
You know, you'll pay
the popcorn.

444
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,442
125 MINUTES LATER

445
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,523
Man, that was bullshit.

446
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:25,020
It was...

447
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,481
- It was so long.
- Yeah. They coulda edited it down a bit.

448
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,659
He was mocking the Führer.

449
00:41:34,246 --> 00:41:37,237
I'm getting a sense there's a lot
about Nazis you don't know.

450
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:41,990
- But I am a Nazi.
- Yeah, I know but you are not like...

451
00:41:42,713 --> 00:41:47,107
Well like them.
A bunch of stupid bullies.

452
00:41:48,097 --> 00:41:50,630
No, I'm sure they're good boys

453
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:53,425
and loyal to the Reich,
and their mothers.

454
00:41:53,622 --> 00:41:56,229
Look, they are wearing the symbol of love.

455
00:41:56,596 --> 00:41:59,016
- The swastika?
- Yeah.

456
00:41:59,112 --> 00:42:01,053
I have never heard they call it
that before.

457
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:03,795
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

458
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,650
- Good evening, boys.
- What have we there?

459
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,640
What we got here, blond hair, blue
eyes, nice rack.

460
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,095
Even Hitler would get a hard-on.

461
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:22,800
- I got this. Look guys, we don't want
any trouble. - Why don't you get lost hobo.

462
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,050
Look, I got the funniest story to tell you.
Your not gonna believe this...

463
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,071
Stop that, that is enough.

464
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:33,018
What she needs is a good war.

465
00:42:33,214 --> 00:42:36,597
A war always make the president popular.

466
00:42:36,663 --> 00:42:41,176
Well, I might be able 
to help her out there.

467
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:44,074
How do you mean?

468
00:42:44,201 --> 00:42:48,310
One word from me, and the invasion
from the Moon begins.

469
00:42:52,508 --> 00:42:55,417
- You never break character do you?
- No.

470
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:59,375
I can never be broken.

471
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:02,648
- You smell so good.
- The time has come.

472
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:06,493
I will show you my plans.

473
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:08,900
Come back here.

474
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:19,808
Look, look.
I've mapped out some things.

475
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:21,946
Oh, big fella.

476
00:43:22,044 --> 00:43:23,900
All work and no play?

477
00:43:30,335 --> 00:43:34,086
Now listen, do you think
if I asphyxiate the president...

478
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,523
will the troops stand in line with us?

479
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:41,682
When I order the moon invasion.

480
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:44,233
it will be quietless bloodshed

481
00:43:45,566 --> 00:43:49,014
After I eliminate the Moon Führer,
of course.

482
00:43:59,874 --> 00:44:01,537
Klaus Adler.

483
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:13,024
Heil Hitler!

484
00:44:14,482 --> 00:44:17,015
You name's not 'Hitler!

485
00:44:18,371 --> 00:44:23,250
So Klaus, is the clown joining us?

486
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:27,093
What, did you all buy tickets?

487
00:44:29,636 --> 00:44:32,991
Okay, so, do you want to introduce
me to your friends?

488
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:37,664
Get your hooks off me
you crystal noob piece-of-shit!

489
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:41,836
I can make this worth your while.
Just please let me go.

490
00:44:41,897 --> 00:44:44,714
Do it, Moon Corporal.

491
00:44:55,214 --> 00:45:01,829
And you want to eliminate
the Mondführer?

492
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:09,714
Do you know
the penalty for high treason?

493
00:45:15,976 --> 00:45:19,741
<i>This is flagship Siegfried speaking.</i>

494
00:45:19,837 --> 00:45:23,765
<i>We've reached the orbit and we're
ready for the Valkyries to start.</i>

495
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,766
<i>Battleship Heinrich ready for attack.</i>

496
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,967
<i>Battleship Biterolf ready for attack.</i>

497
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,253
- The fleet is ready, mein Führer.
- Excellent.

498
00:45:41,474 --> 00:45:44,226
They have to wait for my return.

499
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:50,120
We shall then begin
the Meteorblitzkrieg.

500
00:45:50,212 --> 00:45:55,315
We'll wipe all these sub-humans...

501
00:45:55,432 --> 00:45:58,508
off the face of the Earth.

502
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:00,409
Klaus!

503
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:13,554
I need to tell you that I have
nothing to do with you or your plans.

504
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,800
You Nazi-piece-of-shit.

505
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:21,174
Oh well.
A blessing in disguise.

506
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,285
Now I can kill all the enemies
of the Reich in one stroke.

507
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:31,941
Farewell, puppet Führer.

508
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:09,247
He fell for the old one
last blow job offer.

509
00:47:11,452 --> 00:47:13,899
God, nazis are stupid.

510
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:16,714
I commend you
on your marksmanship.

511
00:47:21,945 --> 00:47:26,555
Shame. She was such a nice girl
Just have to kill her later.

512
00:47:27,813 --> 00:47:30,161
So, it was real?

513
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:34,807
- All this time.
- Never doubt a Nazi, schöne fräulein.

514
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,057
Farwell, fashionista.

515
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:48,348
I have a planet to conquer.

516
00:48:14,026 --> 00:48:18,651
I will just grab this.

517
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:20,521
Bye!

518
00:48:22,823 --> 00:48:24,901
Good luck with the rest of your life.

519
00:48:26,701 --> 00:48:29,070
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

520
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:36,881
They develop like ordinary women.
But look.

521
00:48:36,978 --> 00:48:41,343
Here, no hair, no hair.
Like little girls.

522
00:48:41,892 --> 00:48:46,428
And when they do have hair,
it looks like...

523
00:48:46,692 --> 00:48:49,726
the mustache of
our great Führer.

524
00:48:51,601 --> 00:48:54,026
The pictures kind of turn me on.

525
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,306
Sieg Heil!

526
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:07,820
Mr. Adler.

527
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,056
Where is the Führer?

528
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,870
The Führer is dead.
Long live the new Führer.

529
00:49:14,965 --> 00:49:17,734
That's me, in case
you're wondering.

530
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:24,992
Sieg Heil!

531
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:26,929
This way.

532
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,030
Klaus!

533
00:49:52,294 --> 00:49:53,867
Heil Hitler!

534
00:49:57,722 --> 00:50:02,105
From now on, of course
it is "Heil Adler".

535
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:16,287
Time is

536
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:18,822
the sin.

537
00:50:19,847 --> 00:50:21,635
I'll see you in Valhalla.

538
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:07,588
At 5.45 we'll start firing back.

539
00:51:08,084 --> 00:51:11,878
Every bomb will be retaliated.

540
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:15,093
The Meteorblitzkrieg shall begin!

541
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:57,278
Thank you, Kelly. Moments ago
New York has been under attack.

542
00:51:57,355 --> 00:52:02,600
Witness claim to have seen hundred of UFO's
appearing suddenly over the city and opening fire.

543
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:06,886
Billy get that! Get that!
Are you getting that?

544
00:52:06,952 --> 00:52:09,586
Kelly, the craft is at least 60 feet across.

545
00:52:09,654 --> 00:52:13,986
I'm seeing what appears to be weapons
of some-kind dangling down from the bottom.

546
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:17,581
Oh my God! It's opening fire!
It's opening fire!

547
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:18,882
I'm getting the hell out of here.

548
00:52:18,953 --> 00:52:22,063
<i>There is little information.
But here's what we know at this time.</i>

549
00:52:22,316 --> 00:52:26,276
- Ok you see the thing is, that Klaus...
- I know it was you doing.

550
00:52:27,483 --> 00:52:30,912
- It's wonderful.
- It's wonderful?

551
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:33,995
It's brilliant. I'm a wartime
president now.

552
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:36,778
All presidents who start
a war in their first term

553
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:40,038
always get re-elected, I thought, I was
gonna have to bomb Australia or something.

554
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:43,594
But no, you bring me real...

555
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:48,110
- Who are these guys anyway?
- Nazis.

556
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:52,744
- From the moon.
- Real life Nazis?

557
00:52:52,851 --> 00:52:55,805
Holy shit, this just keeps
getting better and better.

558
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,700
You are a miracle worker babe.

559
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:03,252
They are the only guys we ever actually
managed to beat in a fair fight?

560
00:53:04,825 --> 00:53:08,114
I'm just like Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Only, you know, I'm not spastic.

561
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:10,446
I knew you would be excited.

562
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:17,188
So, if you’re our Roosevelt, then who's your
General Patton or you know, MacArthur?

563
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:20,161
Mr Secretary of Defense,
do you have any thought on this?

564
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,736
Send her.

565
00:53:23,837 --> 00:53:26,526
- Me?
- Hey you're the miracle worker.

566
00:53:26,628 --> 00:53:29,018
Apparently you dodge bullets too.

567
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:33,576
- I wouldn't know... - What to wear?
You will think of something, you always do.

568
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:35,269
Madam President...

569
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:37,900
ready to face the music?

570
00:54:05,072 --> 00:54:08,721
It's the space Nazis!

571
00:54:26,185 --> 00:54:29,595
Take us upstate.
We need to go back to the Moon.

572
00:54:29,691 --> 00:54:31,700
We? No, no, no! See?
We rhymes with me.

573
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,249
- And ain't going.
- Than, you don't get it!

574
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,955
They have the Götterdämmerung
on the Moon.

575
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,365
I don't give a damn
what they have.

576
00:54:36,436 --> 00:54:39,736
- I'm not going back, to that place. No way!
- You want to look like that for the rest of your life?

577
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:42,535
Great, now this is my fault.

578
00:54:44,215 --> 00:54:48,607
- Let me in.
- I am no hero, James.

579
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:51,080
I need you.

580
00:55:30,312 --> 00:55:32,664
Do you know how to drive this thing?

581
00:55:33,636 --> 00:55:37,813
Well can't be any different than
playing 'wing commander'

582
00:55:37,856 --> 00:55:40,472
Let's try...

583
00:56:05,547 --> 00:56:09,441
I swear we do not have
nothing on the Moon.

584
00:56:09,508 --> 00:56:11,368
- Japan?
- It is not ours.

585
00:56:11,439 --> 00:56:13,041
- China?
- It is not us.

586
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:15,058
It's bloody well not ours.

587
00:56:15,101 --> 00:56:18,738
- I confess.
- Yes, North Korea? Confess to what?

588
00:56:18,822 --> 00:56:21,032
The spaceships are ours.

589
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:26,437
Our beloved leader designed
and build it himself.

590
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:37,492
- What's so funny?
- All right, North Korea. Sit down.

591
00:56:50,186 --> 00:56:54,813
- So, it was you India, I knew that.
- No, no! This is a sign of peace.

592
00:56:54,909 --> 00:56:58,084
- This is the sign of peace.
- Just cut it out, you morons!

593
00:56:58,155 --> 00:57:03,341
These thugs are Nazis
and I mean the real, McCoy.

594
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:06,487
They have been hiding
on the Moon just waiting to pounce.

595
00:57:06,696 --> 00:57:10,224
My question is, what do
you all planning to do about it?

596
00:57:10,284 --> 00:57:13,477
'Cause we just happen to have a little
something up our own sleeve.

597
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:16,540
And I'm sure that you'll
be thankful for it.

598
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:22,756
May I present to you with the Mars
exploration ship, The USS George W. Bush.

599
00:57:27,101 --> 00:57:29,964
Good work, take it to Officer Tyler,
please.

600
00:57:33,126 --> 00:57:36,535
This is trajectory, what's our status
on the orbit window?

601
00:57:36,961 --> 00:57:38,998
Commander on deck.

602
00:57:49,648 --> 00:57:53,681
The hostile fleet has launched a full scale 
aerial attack against the United States.

603
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:58,752
These Zeppelins appear to be carriers and they
are operating fully within the thermosphere.

604
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:03,610
Each of them approximately carrying 200
enemy vessels, and are extremely...

605
00:58:04,308 --> 00:58:07,300
Hell hath no fury, Heir Adler.

606
00:58:07,686 --> 00:58:10,931
Alright kiddies, let's get
this show on the road.

607
00:58:20,673 --> 00:58:23,847
Vivian, you look great.
How is it going up there?

608
00:58:23,896 --> 00:58:25,835
Madam President, I couldn't be better.

609
00:58:25,896 --> 00:58:28,667
I am packing dozens of mega tons
of nuclear warheads

610
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:32,334
which I am going to carefully
place up Klaus's kraut ass.

611
00:58:32,382 --> 00:58:35,575
- Just as soon I get him in my sight.
- Carry on, kick butt.

612
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:38,353
Let's see what that baby can do!

613
00:59:10,725 --> 00:59:14,734
Working at optimum capacity.
Ammo consumption within tolerance.

614
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:33,589
We're coming under extremely heavy fire.
We gonna need reinforcement right now.

615
00:59:36,129 --> 00:59:37,774
What the hell is the meaning of this?

616
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:40,900
Good day mates. This is Australian ship,
Dundee 01. Ready to kick ass.

617
00:59:41,009 --> 00:59:42,827
Spitfire reporting in.

618
00:59:42,994 --> 00:59:45,808
Hanging in there W.
Canada joining the battle.

619
00:59:45,835 --> 00:59:48,476
This is a direct violation of
this nations space treaty that

620
00:59:48,507 --> 00:59:50,699
you all signed, every single one of you.

621
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,320
MIR is ready to join the battle.

622
00:59:57,209 --> 00:59:59,526
That was supposed
to be destroyed.

623
00:59:59,879 --> 01:00:04,005
This is an outrage, you're all
liars, just like my ex ex-husband.

624
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:09,476
- Calm down lady, calm down.
- Don't you lady me, Pinko.

625
01:00:09,524 --> 01:00:11,752
Okay, who didn't armed
their spaceship?

626
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:15,262
Great, great. That's just great

627
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,350
- You all gave me your word.
- But you broke yours.

628
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:21,087
We always break ours,
that's just what we do.

629
01:00:21,548 --> 01:00:23,562
Okay, fine, fine, fine!

630
01:00:23,634 --> 01:00:27,507
Let just beat shit out of these pricks
and talk about the details later.

631
01:00:50,951 --> 01:00:52,909
Heroes of the First Fleet,

632
01:00:53,038 --> 01:00:55,543
continue your attack to the last man

633
01:00:55,659 --> 01:00:58,269
and remember you're fighting
for the Reich!

634
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,270
<i>Where the hell did they come from?</i>

635
01:01:05,844 --> 01:01:09,165
Prepare an appropriate uniform
for the Führer.

636
01:01:17,193 --> 01:01:20,599
The Fatherland is calling
its children!

637
01:01:20,852 --> 01:01:27,600
This device will complete
the biggest war machine of all times.

638
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,400
- The Götterdämmerung will fly!
- Heil Adler!

639
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,223
This is beautiful.

640
01:02:07,107 --> 01:02:10,400
- Where the hell are we going?
- To the Götterdämmerung.

641
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,100
I think Klaus will be there.

642
01:02:22,812 --> 01:02:24,900
What did you think of that?
Adler?

643
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:27,240
Alright, what about this
Moon business?

644
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:30,373
What do you say we head on over
and slap them around a bit?

645
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:35,273
Klaus, baby I'm coming
to get to get ya'.

646
01:02:46,845 --> 01:02:49,018
Attention!

647
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:52,100
Heil Adler!

648
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,180
Heil!

649
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,927
As you were.

650
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,165
Well?

651
01:03:03,711 --> 01:03:07,783
The Earth fleet will be
within firing range in 20 minutes.

652
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:15,000
- Are your troops ready?
- We're waiting for Dr. Richter.

653
01:03:25,258 --> 01:03:29,146
- What the hell is this place?
- This is the Götterdämmerung.

654
01:03:29,262 --> 01:03:31,497
It will liberate the Earth.

655
01:03:31,897 --> 01:03:33,673
Actually,

656
01:03:34,259 --> 01:03:36,900
it is the biggest war
machine ever created by man.

657
01:03:42,023 --> 01:03:47,655
- This is the bridge. There's where I'm going.
- I need to find your father, so...

658
01:03:47,751 --> 01:03:50,893
- Where do you think he at?
- I think you will find him over there.

659
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:54,915
Try to sneak in, and please
paralyze the engines.

660
01:03:55,339 --> 01:04:00,509
- Or otherwise the earth is destroyed.
- Note to self, paralyze the engines. Got it.

661
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,900
- Oh. No, no no no. - What?
- You be careful.

662
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:06,604
- I mean you know...
- What?

663
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:10,745
- Because you like me.
- Right...

664
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,515
Oh, come on, a little.
I mean...

665
01:04:18,045 --> 01:04:19,491
You like me?

666
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:40,575
We have a visual on the
Nazi fortress, commander.

667
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,201
Obvious and overstated
as usually,Klaus.

668
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:48,713
Alright, everyone,
let's get those nukes in action.

669
01:04:48,827 --> 01:04:52,376
- I'm declaring this fortress a free-fire-zone.
- But Commander,there are woman and children down there.

670
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,451
The United States of America
does not negotiate with terrorists.

671
01:05:00,918 --> 01:05:03,999
- Prime warhead on secondary armament.
- Roger that.

672
01:05:04,444 --> 01:05:07,500
- Prepare all available ordinance for ground
bombardment.- Fire the fucking nukes!

673
01:05:10,664 --> 01:05:12,202
Nukes away.

674
01:05:47,713 --> 01:05:49,300
Job well done!

675
01:05:54,561 --> 01:05:55,905
Move!

676
01:06:01,382 --> 01:06:04,303
Who dares disturb me?

677
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:07,037
Dr. Richter!

678
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:11,117
-  How much time do you need?
-  The Götterdämmerung will fly.

679
01:06:11,518 --> 01:06:14,418
It will be ready
for  the final victory.

680
01:06:14,633 --> 01:06:16,995
Cut the crap.
How long?

681
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:19,610
Let's say three months,
give or take a little.

682
01:06:19,711 --> 01:06:21,711
Maybe a little earlier, maybe later.

683
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:23,859
You have three minutes.

684
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:29,300
He cut me off. It's not that easy.
Russia wasn't conquered in a day...

685
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,776
Hey, quack!

686
01:06:31,352 --> 01:06:32,800
You remember me?

687
01:06:32,901 --> 01:06:34,101
No.

688
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,200
The Moon spook you
turn into a snowflake.

689
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:44,222
Start the Helium-3 engines.

690
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:51,045
Now!

691
01:06:54,398 --> 01:06:56,421
Start the engines.

692
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,200
Oh shit, it's alive

693
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:45,138
He sure  must have the smallest
dick in the universe.

694
01:07:49,022 --> 01:07:50,567
Load the cannons.

695
01:07:53,295 --> 01:07:54,982
Time...

696
01:07:58,648 --> 01:08:00,442
to fuck back.

697
01:08:14,055 --> 01:08:16,991
Everyone, take positions around
this fat phallus

698
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,928
and wait for my command
to open fire.

699
01:08:27,054 --> 01:08:29,874
- Offensive run confirmed.
- Let her rip.

700
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,180
Shit!

701
01:08:41,259 --> 01:08:43,353
- Are the cannon ready to fire?
- They are.

702
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:47,400
But the Earth is below the horizon,
on the other side of the Moon.

703
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:49,316
We can't shoot.

704
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,895
Full moon was yesterday.

705
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:55,510
Let's make a brand new horizon.

706
01:08:55,526 --> 01:08:57,255
Fire at will.

707
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,460
What the fuck?

708
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:08,634
Reactivate the system.
Weapons sergeant.

709
01:10:28,045 --> 01:10:30,112
We'll see...

710
01:10:31,658 --> 01:10:35,060
The projectiles of Götterdämmerung
are made out of metallic hydrogen.

711
01:10:35,376 --> 01:10:39,044
it's aggregate state can only be reached
under immense pressure...

712
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:42,542
<i>National Anthem.
For motivation, break glass.</i>

713
01:10:42,543 --> 01:10:44,543
The impact can be quite diverse.

714
01:11:06,063 --> 01:11:07,800
It's no time to sing now!

715
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,848
It's a false alarm!

716
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:22,200
Are you all imbeciles?
Go and see what's going on!

717
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,200
On the double!

718
01:11:47,334 --> 01:11:51,420
- Renate.
- I won't let you do it.

719
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:55,300
What will you do?
Shoot me?

720
01:12:10,821 --> 01:12:12,784
Good girl...

721
01:12:15,055 --> 01:12:18,478
Renate Richter, my bride-to-be.

722
01:12:18,683 --> 01:12:22,022
You destroyed something beautiful,
something wonderful.

723
01:12:22,036 --> 01:12:25,408
A future world
full of Aryan children.

724
01:12:25,503 --> 01:12:27,785
Our Aryan children!

725
01:12:30,255 --> 01:12:34,441
But you betrayed me,
and for that you shall pay.

726
01:12:35,757 --> 01:12:38,849
Your beauty should adorn/
decorate Odin's table.

727
01:12:38,964 --> 01:12:42,973
- Klaus! Wait! Let me say something.
- Now?

728
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:47,812
- I'm a bit busy.
- I have always respected you.

729
01:12:48,627 --> 01:12:50,878
As Führer,

730
01:12:51,026 --> 01:12:52,558
and as a man.

731
01:12:53,213 --> 01:12:55,673
I've even loved you.

732
01:12:55,894 --> 01:12:58,073
I belong to you.

733
01:12:58,589 --> 01:13:00,092
To you.

734
01:13:01,007 --> 01:13:02,792
Cute little speech.

735
01:13:03,808 --> 01:13:06,406
But it is too late, my dear.
Goodbye.

736
01:13:06,707 --> 01:13:09,507
I understand.
I heil you.

737
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:12,669
My Klaus.

738
01:13:14,504 --> 01:13:17,383
Sieg Heil, my Führer.

739
01:13:34,195 --> 01:13:37,902
- Washington, do you hear me? Washington?
- Where are you?

740
01:13:38,018 --> 01:13:40,871
- You need to shut down the engine
- I'm working on it.

741
01:13:40,872 --> 01:13:42,172
Shit...

742
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:52,614
Congratulations.

743
01:15:53,406 --> 01:15:54,989
High five.

744
01:15:57,481 --> 01:15:59,545
Well, that was disappointing.

745
01:16:03,038 --> 01:16:06,400
Do you think he suffered?
Even just a little?

746
01:16:06,506 --> 01:16:11,997
Vivian, I knew you could do it. You're foxy
and salacious, all the way. Congratulations.

747
01:16:12,645 --> 01:16:15,400
- What's Helium-3?
- Helium.

748
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,970
Did you say Helium-3?

749
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,189
Yes, there is like about 15 to 20 giant towers
that appear to be full of this stuff.

750
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,250
- That's ours.
- It is? Why?

751
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:30,000
Helium-3, will make the U.S. independent
of all energy needs for next thousand years.

752
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:32,900
Yes, it is ours.

753
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,350
No, no no. Hear me out.
Hear me out.

754
01:16:37,516 --> 01:16:40,923
The moon is American soil.
Moon flag, stars and stripes.

755
01:16:41,038 --> 01:16:43,373
Who beat the Moon Nazis?
We did.

756
01:16:43,489 --> 01:16:47,671
Well, yeah yeah, alright, you help out here and there,
but ultimately it's just like World War II ...

757
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,482
and who won that?
We did.

758
01:16:49,996 --> 01:16:52,906
- You lie.
- You don't believe me?

759
01:16:53,001 --> 01:16:55,355
Watch the movie.
Movies do not lie.

760
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:58,026
Not the shoes, Jesus.

761
01:16:59,141 --> 01:17:01,272
Vivian, this is the Secretary of Defense.

762
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:04,850
- Defend Helium-3 at all costs.
- But against who?

763
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:07,009
Against everybody!

764
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,854
Please don't, never again!

765
01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:46,755
Please stop.

766
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,630
What was the Earth like?

767
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,300
Different.

768
01:19:09,007 --> 01:19:11,082
When can we go there?

769
01:19:12,026 --> 01:19:14,080
Soon. Soon...

770
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:20,162
- But how?
- In peace.

771
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:30,326
Unfortunately that's the story
of revenge. It's messy.

772
01:19:30,442 --> 01:19:33,988
Never really works out the way
you wanted to.

773
01:19:35,297 --> 01:19:37,501
I feel lonely.

774
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:42,347
The eternal love of God, the love of God
into our hearts, or we will burn...

775
01:19:42,463 --> 01:19:45,556
burn in hell,
burning in eternal damnation.

776
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,746
Renate.

Washington.

778
01:20:05,288 --> 01:20:06,792
You are alive.

779
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:11,880
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

780
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:22,340
And you're the way 
you meant to be.

781
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:36,824
Are you aware that
you are kissing a black man?

782
01:20:45,002 --> 01:20:48,090
I guess you have a lot of work
cut out for you.
