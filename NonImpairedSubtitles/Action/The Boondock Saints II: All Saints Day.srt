1
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:21,077
<i>There's two kinds of people in this world</i>
<i>when you boil it all down.</i>

2
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,622
<i>You've got your talkers</i>
<i>and you've got your doers.</i>

3
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:28,558
<i>Most people are just talkers.</i>
<i>All they got is talk.</i>

4
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:34,089
<i>But when all is said and done,</i>
<i>it's the doers who change this world.</i>

5
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:39,728
<i>And when they do that, they change us.</i>
<i>And that's why we never forget them.</i>

6
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,031
<i>So, which one are you?</i>

7
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,734
<i>Do you just talk about it</i>

8
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:46,437
<i>or do you stand up</i>
<i>and do something about it?</i>

9
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:52,415
<i>Because believe you me,</i>
<i>all the rest of it is just coffeehouse bullshit.</i>

10
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,532
<i>Peace, they say, is the enemy of memory.</i>

11
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,005
<i>So it had been for my boys.</i>

12
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,310
<i>For some time now,</i>
<i>the past had felt like a dream to them,</i>

13
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,109
<i>faded and worn.</i>

14
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,784
<i>And then suddenly,</i>
<i>as if not a day had passed,</i>

15
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,518
<i>it was back.</i>

16
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,860
<i>l could see it in their eyes.</i>

17
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,892
<i>l could feel it, heavy in their presence.</i>

18
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,040
<i>Something calling them back.</i>

19
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,424
Something's happened.

20
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,780
No! Stop! Stop, stop!

21
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,083
Please, stop! Oh, God! Please! Please!

22
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,753
God, no, stop.. .

23
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,202
A priest?

24
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,102
Did they release his name?

25
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:37,315
No, but l made a few calls.
l still have friends in the diocese there.

26
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,878
McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.

27
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,917
-You knew him?
-Knew of him. Everybody did.

28
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,425
He's a good man.
Youth hostels, soup kitchens.

29
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,262
He even made it to the papers sometimes.

30
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,132
Look, boys,
l think it's best if you just stay put

31
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,002
until we try to figure out
what the hell is going on.

32
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,078
Aren't you at least gonna try
and talk them out of this?

33
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,673
For all we know, it could be somebody
just trying to get away with murder here.

34
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:12,910
Aye.

35
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,315
Only there's a thousand easier ways
to do that.

36
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,521
Trust me.

37
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,818
Someone's trying to call them out.

38
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:29,095
You kill a priest, in a church,
and make it look like it was them.

39
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,797
Bring them back with a vengeance.

40
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,698
Someone thinks it's really clever.

41
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:41,143
-Only one problem with this little plan.
-What's that?

42
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,612
lt worked.

43
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,580
Exactly what do you intend to do?

44
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,622
Every last motherfucker
that had anything to do with it.

45
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,373
<i>There is no new information</i>
<i>on the victim found slain</i>

46
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,210
<i>this morning inside</i>
<i>the Church of the Holy Saints.</i>

47
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:27,082
As you can see, the size of the crowd here
has increased substantially

48
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:31,646
as we have confirmed that the body
was ritualized with pennies in the eyes.

49
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,225
Many remember this
as the grisly calling card

50
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,490
of the prolific vigilante killers
known as the Saints,

51
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,996
<i>who went on a murder spree here in Boston.</i>

52
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,570
<i>A rampage that ended eight years ago when</i>
<i>the Saints brazenly walked into open court</i>

53
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,400
<i>and executed Mafia don</i>
<i>Poppa Joe Yakavetta</i>

54
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,407
<i>before a courtroom of terrified witnesses</i>

55
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,308
and then simply disappeared without a trace.

56
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,312
<i>As police have yet to confirm</i>
<i>the Saints' possible involvement,</i>

57
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,145
<i>the ominous question</i>
<i>hangs heavy in the air.</i>

58
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,309
<i>''Are they back?''</i>

59
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,149
We need to keep our heads here.

60
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,989
lt's probably not even them.

61
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,530
Course it ain't them.
lt doesn't really matter, does it?

62
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,134
All our skeletons just came screaming
out of the closet.

63
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,170
-We're fucked!
-We're not fucked!

64
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,173
We are totally fucked! And not just fucked.

65
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,369
Like elephant-dick-pounded-in-the-ass,
no-reach-around,

66
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,140
-jungle-fucked!
-Now's not the time to panic, green beans!

67
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:33,512
l disagree! Now is a perfect time to panic.
We are all accessories.. .

68
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,314
-Don't fucking say it!
-l'm gonna say it, all right.

69
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,219
-You've got a mouth on you, Greenly.
-Both of you calm down. Just calm down.

70
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,018
Shut the fuck up!

71
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,827
Her ETA's 10 minutes.

72
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,988
Thanks, Seamus.

73
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,500
lt's game time. How we playing this?

74
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,076
Feds love to pull
the divide-and-conquer routine.

75
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,546
We hardline her. Stick together on this.

76
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,913
-Agreed?
-Agreed.

77
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,148
We're a brick wall.

78
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,490
Let's rock this bitch.

79
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,453
Eunice Bloom. lt's a pleasure.

80
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,357
Now, you have got to be Greenly.

81
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,362
Smecker always said
you were the funny one.

82
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,024
Well, funny as in ''ha-ha,'' though,

83
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,795
not like funny as in ''gay,''
'cause l'm totally not.

84
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,599
What we're trying to figure out is,
with all due respect, Agent Bloom.. .

85
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,800
-''Special.' '
-Excuse me?

86
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,935
You see, there's a ''special''
before my ''agent.' '

87
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,106
lf we're gonna address each other formally,
l'd appreciate if you popped it in there,

88
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,877
because it makes me feel special.

89
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,747
Of course, l was hoping
we could be a bit more personable.

90
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,754
ln fact, l'd welcome you to call me Eunice,
and maybe l.. .

91
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,619
Okay, Eunice.

92
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,791
l don't see why the fuck the Fed
is even involved.

93
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:27,123
''Fuck''? This isn't a ''fuck'' situation, is it?

94
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,996
l mean, l can understand a ''goddamn''
or two, but why skip all the way.. .

95
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,731
What is the Fed's interest in this?

96
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,972
Their interest, Detective,
is capturing the men responsible

97
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,343
for the murders
of 22 of Boston's finest criminals.

98
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,781
They could have sent anyone. They sent me.
Now, why do you think that is?

99
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,754
Well, since we've already broken
the ''fuck'' barrier, allow me to be blunt.

100
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,120
lt is because l am so fucking smart

101
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,683
that l make smart people feel
that they are retarded.

102
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,818
-Motherfuckers! Which one do you want?
-Me first, man, me first!

103
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,849
Bust his head!

104
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,821
That son of a bitch over there!

105
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,201
All right! House is closed, motherfuckers!

106
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,196
Why are his hands chained?

107
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,508
Romeo is very fast, man.

108
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,645
He says the Frenchman can't lay
a hand on him.

109
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,703
But he can't hit him back.

110
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,007
That's the bet, <i>ese.</i>

111
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,844
He's got to last five minutes.

112
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,159
-Fifty on the Mexican.
-Fifty on the Mexican.

113
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,491
Never fight a Mexican, Pierre.

114
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,867
Pound for pound,
toughest motherfuckers on Earth!

115
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,268
Attaboy!

116
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,072
You know why? We like pain, Pierre.

117
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,339
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

118
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,281
Think about it, man. Tabasco sauce?

119
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,184
What kind of fucked-up people
would even invent that shit?

120
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,387
Get the fuck out of the way!

121
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,789
Whore.

122
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,461
Don't be scared, now.
Remember, l can't hit you.

123
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,367
l ain't gonna hit you!

124
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,739
Found a loophole, bitch!
l ought to be a lawyer.

125
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,826
Thank you!

126
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,296
Shit, man!

127
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,285
Please, stop! Oh, God! Please!

128
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,125
Please! Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, God!

129
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,702
lt wasn't them,
but l'm sure you boys already knew that.

130
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,772
All their vics were criminals.
Clearly not the case here.

131
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:02,939
So, it wasn't them,

132
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,108
which makes this a local matter
and falls under our jurisdiction.

133
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,450
So, with all due respect,
we'll see you later, Special Agent Bloom.

134
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:16,452
''With all due respect.' '
Man, l hate it when people say that,

135
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,963
because it is inevitably followed
by a disrespectful remark.

136
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,329
Here, let me give you an example.

137
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,528
With all due respect, Detective,

138
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:30,199
this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction

139
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,903
l fucking say it does.

140
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,242
-You fucking.. .
-Let's just.. .

141
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,016
What can you tell us about the shooters?

142
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,748
''Shooter.' ' Singular.

143
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,988
And l can tell you.. .

144
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,994
How shall l put this delicately?
He's a short little fucker.

145
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,193
One guy. Dwarf. Got it.

146
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,002
Let me show you what l'm talking about.

147
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,538
Detective Greenly,

148
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,679
you're the victim.

149
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,773
David. You can call me David.

150
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,215
Very well, David.

151
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:19,285
The Saints' signature stance,
Copley Plaza Hotel eight years ago.

152
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,785
Two men of identical height
put Yuri Petrova on his knees

153
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,022
and each dropped iron
to the back of his head.

154
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,135
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand.

155
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,398
Eyes front, David.

156
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,943
The position of the victim and the angles
produced by the killers' stance

157
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,943
created a unique scenario.

158
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,810
The bullets crisscrossed in the skull
and exited the eyes.

159
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:48,113
Here, this did not occur.
The rounds moved on a straight trajectory

160
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,485
through the back of the victim's head
and out the front,

161
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,717
which happens when.. .

162
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,262
One guy's holding two guns
to the back of your head.

163
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,423
One guy.

164
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,576
But you said he was wicked short.

165
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:20,015
The Saints were later determined
to be 5'1 1'' tall.

166
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,950
The rounds exit Petrova's eyeballs.

167
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:29,684
Here, they came out the lower cheek,
three, four inches below the eyes.

168
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:34,925
That puts him at 5'7''-ish.
That's not uncommonly short.

169
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,501
The killer posed as a late-night confessor.

170
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:43,301
Once the victim entered the booth,
the killer had him isolated. No escape.

171
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:47,309
Short stuff comes out of the confessional,
kicks in the door of the priest's chambers,

172
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,847
leaving a crescent-shaped indentation,

173
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,713
<i>which tells us that this cowboy</i>
<i>was wearing a boot with a pronounced heel.</i>

174
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,717
<i>Gave him a couple inches.</i>

175
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,617
<i>We're looking about 5'5'', gentlemen.</i>

176
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,881
-That's wicked short.
-Wicked.

177
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,192
<i>Speculation on the Saints'</i>
<i>possible involvement</i>

178
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,060
<i>in the murder of Father Douglas McKinney</i>
<i>continues to boil over.</i>

179
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,793
<i>ln fact, it has split the public</i>
<i>right down the middle.</i>

180
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,663
<i>My cousin was there. He saw the body.</i>
<i>His hands were crossed over his chest.</i>

181
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,830
<i>lt was them.</i>

182
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,909
<i>-lt wasn't them.</i>
<i>-You know, maybe the priest did something.</i>

183
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,841
<i>There were pennies in his eyes, they did it.</i>

184
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,841
<i>-They didn't do it.</i>
<i>-lt wasn't them.</i>

185
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,749
<i>-You're on the air, caller.</i>
<i>-Well, finally, man, yeah.</i>

186
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,019
<i>This guy was indicted last year</i>
<i>for ordering the murders of 22 people.</i>

187
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,494
<i>And it slid right off his back. Piece of shit!</i>

188
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,829
<i>lndeed, Boston has been under</i>
<i>the terrible reign of this thug for years now.</i>

189
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,334
<i>Where's the DA's office?</i>

190
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:48,167
<i>Why can't they make anything stick</i>
<i>to Concezio Yakavetta?</i>

191
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,705
l can't believe
that none of us were consulted on this!

192
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,839
The disrespect!

193
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:02,918
We never would have okayed such a thing.
A priest! lt's <i>infamita!</i>

194
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:07,253
Are we not Catholics?
For Christ's fucking sakes!

195
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:12,296
And for what? Revenge?
There's no business in it, Concezio.

196
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,023
The cops. They can be all over us.

197
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,068
Forget the cops.
What about these Saints fuckers?

198
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,966
These guys were long gone,

199
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,629
and now you're trying to bring the devil
right back to our doorstep?

200
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,799
Eight years ago,

201
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,641
these vigilante fucks
put my father on his knees

202
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,479
<i>and executed him</i>

203
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,219
in public.

204
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:47,898
<i>Mi padrino,</i> a blood relative
and benedictator to all of you.

205
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:56,808
You think that l don't know
that each one of you

206
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,144
has been waking up with the night sweats
over this for eight years?

207
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:08,251
These sons of bitches prison-fucked us!

208
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,849
ln the ass!

209
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,584
And then they wiped their dicks
on our grandma's drapes!

210
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:22,166
And we have been living in silent fear
ever since.

211
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,104
We don't talk about it.

212
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,000
Rape victims seldom do.

213
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:37,538
Concezio is right.
Pretending you don't got a problem

214
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,645
don't solve nothing.

215
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,884
Let's take a moment

216
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,186
and look at the serendiculous.. .

217
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,990
Seren.. . Seren.. . Seren.. .

218
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,621
Serendipitous.

219
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,897
...type situation we find ourselves in.

220
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,300
There's a wicked good chance
that these Saints are gonna show.

221
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:10,908
And this time,
they don't catch us with our pants down.

222
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:18,713
This time, we deal with them
proactiviously, huh?

223
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,716
And don't forget Boston's finest.

224
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,996
With their second bite at the apple

225
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,898
they've got every reason in the world
to crank up the heat.

226
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,695
And as for the Saints' doting fans,

227
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:34,895
fuck them!

228
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,944
Bad luck.

229
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,055
How would he even recognize us?

230
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,250
You don't remember the fucking sketches
on the news channel?

231
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,122
-Shit, that's right.
-Fuck's sake.

232
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,853
You know,
every time you see those composites on TV

233
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,057
and they catch the guy,
it looks nothing like him.

234
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,924
-But ours.. .
-Just our luck, right?

235
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,894
We draw Leonardo fucking da Vinci
as a sketch artist.

236
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,108
And two days ago,
we looked like Jesus Christ.

237
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,542
-What the fuck we cut our hair for?
-Yeah, that's right.

238
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:19,482
l don't know, it seemed like the thing to do
at the time, though, didn't it?

239
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,451
-Maybe we should dye it.
-What?

240
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,753
Well, they're always dying their hair
in the movies, like <i>The Fugitive.</i>

241
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,826
lt's covert and shit.

242
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,891
What color would you dye it?

243
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,227
Lighter, l guess.

244
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:41,295
-Do you mean blonde?
-l didn't fucking say that.

245
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,271
Like California surfer boy.

246
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,935
-lt's not what l'm saying.
-Like gay, gay, gay,

247
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,477
-faggoty blonde.
-l'm fucking warning you!

248
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,410
-''Stay gold, Ponyboy!''
-l'm fucking warning you!

249
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,311
-''Stay gold.. .' '
-Fuck you!

250
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,940
You fucking cunt!

251
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,678
Jesus fucking Christ!

252
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,082
-Well, l was fucking mad!
-Shit!

253
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,315
What kind of fucking crazy.. .

254
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,861
-l know who you are. You guys are.. .
-Shut it!

255
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,488
This is so fucking cool, man!

256
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,466
l'm from Boston and l love you guys.
Shit, everybody loves you guys.

257
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,595
Maybe l can get on this thing.
You know, bring some <i>raza</i> into this.

258
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:18,301
Hey, is it true that you guys say a prayer
before you grease somebody?

259
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,854
And an awesome wailing
was heard throughout heaven.

260
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,289
And the terrible hand of the Lord
struck upon the Earth.

261
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:39,296
And as Almighty God created you,

262
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,533
now he calleth you home!

263
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,872
Busy signal. Will have to call us back.

264
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,411
Let's have a shot while we're waiting.

265
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,756
-l think he took a little piss.
-That shit was not funny!

266
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:10,157
lt just came out me fucking nose.

267
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:14,028
Thank you, Jesus.
Thought l greased my drawers.

268
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,098
No.

269
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:26,005
l've got connects all over Beantown, man.

270
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,409
Romeo will hook you up like a tow truck.

271
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,777
-No.
-Why not?

272
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,352
We don't have to give you fucking reasons.
Forget it.

273
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,852
lt's because l'm Mexican, isn't it?

274
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,888
How dare you, sir, insinuate such a thing?

275
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,222
The fact that you're a greasy spic,
it's got nothing to do with it.

276
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,286
Okay, l'm gonna let you have that one,
but, look, l can do this.

277
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,023
This isn't rocket surgery.

278
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:52,126
You guys find the bad guys
doing bad stuff and you kill them, right?

279
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,238
Well, it's not that simple, actually.

280
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,899
-Yes, it is.
-Suppose you're right.

281
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:02,077
l was just hoping that we was
a bit more artistic about it, l think.

282
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,080
Yeah? Well, you ain't.

283
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,648
Now, what do you plan on doing
when you get to US soil?

284
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:16,151
We don't really have, you know,
a succinct plan yet, you know, per se.

285
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,422
Haven't really worked it all out, as it were.

286
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:23,968
As it were. Not fully developed, per se.

287
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,832
You two leprechaun dicks need to chill
in the greenroom

288
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:31,238
sipping on some Pellegrino
and let your manager handle the details.

289
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,005
And you'd better have
my Cub Scout badge ready.

290
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,137
Because if you wanna kick Yakavetta
in the nuts,

291
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,512
have him wake up
with a horse head in his bed,

292
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,518
Romeo's got an ace in the hole for you.

293
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:51,253
And that's all she wrote.
Everything points in the same direction.

294
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,496
Get out.

295
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:06,207
Look, l have been stonewalling
the media on this thing.

296
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,211
l've got half of New England
thinking the Saints whacked the priest

297
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,783
and the other half thinking they're innocent.

298
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,784
lt's a powder keg.

299
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:18,344
And we're talking riot gear
at Celtics games here.

300
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:24,117
Now, l can clear them of this murder
and take the piss right out of this thing.

301
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:29,228
Now, give me one reason
why l shouldn't take this public right now.

302
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,064
Walk with me, Chief. Let's talk.

303
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,643
This is not good.

304
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,246
She's gunning for the boys hard.

305
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:52,823
This broad trying to put a feather in her cap
is gonna get us all locked up.

306
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,324
-l mean, this couldn't be going any worse.
-Just calm down.

307
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,919
Calm down? Calm down? You know
they're gonna throw us in the Hoag.

308
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,259
We put half those deranged sex freaks
in there.

309
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,264
l hope you guys like cock sandwiches,

310
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,165
because we'll be eating them for breakfast,
lunch and dinner!

311
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,598
Now, l understand
you've got a job to do, Chief.

312
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,606
But this pint-sized killer is the only thing

313
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,836
that puts Yakavetta
right in the middle of this.

314
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,778
And if Concezio even sniffs
that we on to him,

315
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,883
he puts a bullet in Napoleon's head,

316
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:22,112
plants him at the bottom of the ocean
and walks.

317
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:26,623
Now it is imperative
that we find this little man.

318
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:03,060
You have said some dumb shit in your days,
but that.. . l.. . You know, that.. . That.. .

319
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,062
What? We're all ''assuming''
Smecker didn't tell her.

320
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,997
''Oh, yeah, by the way,
me and three Boston detectives

321
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,102
''are accessories to murder.
Pass the malt vinegar.' '

322
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,830
Smecker may have been a lot of things,
but he was a stand-up guy.

323
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,408
-And we took an oath. The four of us!
-Yeah!

324
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,740
-Okay! l was just thinking.
-Well, don't do that.

325
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,107
-You're no good at it.
-Fuck you!

326
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,339
You're as dumb as a fucking heel,

327
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,415
-you know that, you blowjob?
-Fucking, cocksucking, hard-on.. .

328
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:29,248
Jesus Christ! Look!
We need to figure out what we're gonna do

329
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,323
when the boys show
and start doing what they do best.

330
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,516
Because that's when the shit's
really gonna hit the fan!

331
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,127
But everyone is assuming
that the boys are gonna turn up.

332
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,992
We got no way of knowing that for sure.

333
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,430
Yeah, that could totally happen.

334
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,430
They could not come back.

335
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,371
What dream world did you two
just slip into?

336
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,206
We know the boys.

337
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:59,807
ls there any part of you
that thinks they're just gonna let this slide?

338
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,109
Believe this.

339
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:06,212
They're either on their way
or they're already here.

340
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,024
l thought you said your car
was inconspicuous.

341
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:22,162
Yeah, well, l don't like words
with ''spic'' right in the middle.

342
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,901
Besides, it is where l live.

343
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,411
Yeah? Where's that? Margaritaville?

344
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:31,208
Hey, l hail from a colorful people.

345
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:36,517
Besides, you wouldn't know style
if it pitched a tent in your ass.

346
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,387
Ace in the hole time.

347
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:44,359
Been a lot of chatter about Yakavetta
being in bed with the Chinese.

348
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,397
This here is little Yaka's <i>yeyo.</i>

349
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,664
All right, here's the plan.

350
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,600
Then we skin out,
we go to Doc's for a shot of lrish,

351
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,002
we're at home in time for tacos.

352
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,801
That's what we do.

353
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,635
-What?
-Well, it's just this plan.. .

354
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,145
-What the fuck's wrong with the plan?
-lt's.. .

355
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:13,614
lt's genius. l can even drive an f-lift, man.

356
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:17,586
-Got my Class D license and everything.
-That's the fucking spirit!

357
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,520
l'm gonna need a gun.

358
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,416
-Forget it.
-Forget it.

359
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:25,292
What the fuck, man? l'm in on this shit.
l'm working here!

360
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,427
-Okay.
-For fuck's sake!

361
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,533
Here's what you're gonna do.

362
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:36,436
You're gonna consider yourself
a fucking pledge until we tell you different.

363
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,673
Can l consider myself your girlfriend, too?

364
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:46,011
That's what you get.
ls there a fucking problem?

365
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,152
lt's fine.

366
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,845
l'm fucking watching you.

367
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,857
You understand me?
Now, you stow that shit.

368
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,624
Don't you worry, Rome.
Shit like this, it builds character.

369
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,460
Yeah, the character of a little bitch.

370
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,133
Now, that's just unprofessional.

371
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,903
So, what do you think?

372
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:14,801
l think Yakavetta killed a good man
just to send us a message.

373
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,073
Well, let's send him one right back.

374
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,322
<i>Motoring</i>

375
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,369
<i>...night</i>

376
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:44,536
<i>...right</i>

377
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,846
<i>And something that rhymes with ''light''</i>

378
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,410
-Why?
-l don't know.

379
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,582
lt's not them.

380
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,393
lt's them.

381
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,296
A wise man once told me,

382
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:13,962
''Where a man's actions are firmly bound
to an unshakable faith,

383
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:18,872
''one's worst nightmares become sudden,
terrifying reality.' '

384
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,472
You didn't have to bash me in the skull!

385
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,310
Sorry, man, we got a plan going here.

386
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,475
Technically, l was supposed
to knock you out.

387
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:31,487
But they gave me this faggoty little gun,
see, and the weight's just not.. .

388
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,318
Christ, that's a gun?

389
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,950
Why didn't you just point it at me
and say ''scram''?

390
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,326
-Scram! Get the fuck out of here! Now!
-You got it!

391
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,660
Hey, guys, let's not let this one little incident
get in the way of.. .

392
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,326
Shut up
and get back behind the fucking wheel!

393
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,132
-Jeez!
-Well,

394
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,942
-at least your plan's off to a winning start.
-Go fuck yourself.

395
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,777
Oh, fuck.

396
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,155
That's heroin.

397
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,797
-How the fuck would you know?
-Fuck you. l know shit.

398
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,201
What's the symbolism here?

399
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:31,046
-Symbolism?
-Yeah. What does this symbolize?

400
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:35,982
Well, it symbolizes a huge fuck-up.

401
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,452
This is a plan that fell to pieces.

402
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:44,722
A lot of it don't make sense,
which is why it all makes perfect sense.

403
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,665
-Christ, what the fuck's he doing?
-l don't know. Hang on!

404
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,233
Fuck's sake.

405
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,369
All right, all right.

406
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,906
Christ, he can't fucking see
where he's going!

407
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,971
Shit! Turn to the left now! Tell him!

408
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,572
-Go left! Go left!
-What?

409
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,914
-That way! Go that way!
-Left? Fuck!

410
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:15,053
l can't believe l let you talk me into this.
Fucking stupid plan.

411
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,720
lt's all in the execution.
And your negative attitude ain't helping any!

412
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,354
-What? What the fuck?
-Negative attitude?

413
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,730
-My fucking negative attitude?
-Yeah, your negative attitude!

414
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:28,896
You've got to visualize the end result!
You've got to force it into reality! Believe!

415
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,234
You've got to fucking believe!

416
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,843
l'm about to believe my fist
right up your fucking ass!

417
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,502
You'll do what?

418
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,841
-Not a believer!
-That's another thing,

419
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,281
don't be down at me,
'cause l'm right fucking there, man!

420
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,615
You've got to believe!

421
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,747
This bitch is fast-a-rooney.

422
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,184
Wait.

423
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,894
-Wait. Wait, wait, hold on.
-Uppey-downey!

424
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:54,928
Shit!

425
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,413
Boys, l believe things in our fair, little city

426
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,479
<i>just got downright biblical.</i>

427
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,249
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

428
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,592
And shepherds we shall be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

429
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,999
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand,

430
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,264
that our feet may swiftly carry out
Thy command.

431
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:12,536
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

432
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,526
<i>While the wicked stand confounded,</i>

433
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,494
<i>call me with Thy Saints surrounded.</i>

434
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,800
Ballistics just dug it out.

435
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:49,074
A.22? You've got to be kidding me.
That's like bringing a knife to a gunfight.

436
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:55,010
Yeah, or like bringing a really small gun
to a gunfight.

437
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,183
l don't know.

438
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,656
Ballistics is reading three shooters,
and this is one of them.

439
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,922
l find it hard to believe that one of the three
most lethal individuals on the planet

440
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,859
just switched over to birdshot.

441
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:11,401
Maybe we're reading this wrong.
Priest was a frame job, right?

442
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,994
Yeah, maybe somebody's trying
to eliminate some competition here?

443
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,266
Yeah.

444
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,045
No, sir, it's them.

445
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,908
Here he comes.

446
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,046
-Doc!
-Doc!

447
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,748
Boys!

448
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:38,089
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Come on in here with that. Get in quick.

449
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,791
Get in out of the cold. Come on.

450
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:46,396
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
l saw the news channel.

451
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,701
-Are you boys all right?
-Sound as an lrish pound, Doc.

452
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,970
-ls it too late for a shot?
-The Lord told me you'd be coming.

453
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,740
''Doc,'' he said. ''They'd be coming.' '
And l was to have everything ready.

454
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,079
And l have. l have everything.. .

455
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,085
lt's all set.

456
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,586
This is our Mexican.

457
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:11,450
Nice to meet you, lad. They call me.. .
Fuck! Ass!

458
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,624
How you doing, Fuck Ass? l'm Romeo.

459
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:23,497
This used to be a speakeasy in the '40s.
l only use it for storage now.

460
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,342
-Holy shit.
-Holy shit.

461
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:35,115
-This is so fucking cool!
-Nobody knows it's up here. You'll be safe.

462
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,587
You can get in and out the fire escape.

463
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:45,421
Know what this is? This is our hideout.
We got a fucking hideout, man!

464
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,189
What, are you fucking five years old?

465
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:54,293
You know, Rome,
we got sticks and blankets.

466
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,498
You can make yourself a fort.

467
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,438
Fuck the both of you, man.
This is fucking sweet.

468
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,373
We even got pinball machines, man.

469
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:27,368
Lobster dick! Look at me! Lobster dick!

470
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,385
Not this time, you little shit.

471
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,887
We'll see about that, old man.

472
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:54,394
Would somebody
please come over here and.. .

473
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,022
-Fuck!
-Me up the.. .

474
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,158
-Ass!
-Yes! That's what he done!

475
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:02,933
That's what he's done every time!
l took you down, old man, l took you down!

476
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:35,136
Are you hungry, lad?
l sent Louie out for some sandwiches.

477
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,773
l could eat.

478
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,808
Decent work.

479
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,211
Do you know what l'm thinking
would be a nice match for the back?

480
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,805
That chocolate hide with the heavy marbling

481
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,384
we've been trying to get rid of
for the last six months.

482
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,954
We'll make a leather man
out of you yet, son.

483
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,314
Go to it, lad.

484
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,262
l can't help you with that, lads.

485
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:09,567
But if you need something, anything,
made out of leather,

486
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,967
we'd be happy to do the job.

487
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,507
How many times have l been nice to you?

488
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,245
How many times do my people come here
and talk to you?

489
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,812
This song and dance is over.
lt's over, motherfucker!

490
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,759
You didn't see anything!

491
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,431
Noah!

492
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,010
No, no, no. No, no, no, no!

493
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:51,978
We got to call the <i>polizia,</i> Noah!
We got to call somebody.

494
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:55,979
Noah! No.

495
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,734
You young guys worry too much.

496
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,706
We always bounce back.

497
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:24,510
Besides, better the chinks than us, right?

498
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,819
This is some serious shit here!

499
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,253
Something amusing you, queer bait?

500
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:40,193
-No, l was just.. .
-You should be focused on the next step!

501
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:47,029
That shipment of H was gonna
square our books for the next six months!

502
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:52,364
-Any thoughts on that?
-Yeah, l got some thoughts on that.

503
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,245
l was just thinking,
not too serendipitous for us.

504
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,609
You.. .

505
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:04,050
lt's like the Roman Empire in here.
You even got concubines and shit.

506
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:10,955
-George. What gives here?
-A little cannoli, shrimp cocktail, huh?

507
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:14,253
l need to see the boss, right away.

508
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,525
Jimmy the Gofer, <i>la cortina.</i>

509
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,262
<i>Get over here.</i>

510
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,403
Hey, boss, l just came by to tell you.. .

511
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:31,242
<i>Push the talk button, numb nuts!</i>

512
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,376
Hello, can you hear me? Over.

513
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:37,283
<i>l can hear you fine.</i>
<i>Now what the fuck are you doing here?</i>

514
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,787
Copy that. Everything's in motion.

515
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,256
All our guys
are gunning for these Jesus freaks.

516
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,123
l figure there's no need for me to be
on the streets no more.

517
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,287
So, which one of these rooms
do you want me to take, huh?

518
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:52,334
<i>Are your ears fucking painted on?</i>
<i>Did l not make it perfectly clear</i>

519
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,630
<i>that you're to stay on the streets</i>
<i>until this is over?</i>

520
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,297
-l was.. .
<i>-Now get the fuck out of here!</i>

521
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,102
<i>Douche bag!</i>

522
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:03,441
<i>And don't come back till l say you can</i>
<i>or you're going back to Brooklyn,</i>

523
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,414
<i>you fat fucking waste of space!</i>

524
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:10,412
<i>You wanna find something in Boston</i>
<i>that don't wanna be found,</i>

525

<i>Out the game, but still got his name.</i>

527
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,687
Yakavetta's gunning for you <i>muchachos,</i>
and hard.

528
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:24,597
Even posted a reward,
like Jesse James-style shit.

529
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:30,940
Anyway, any of his guys that take you out
gets his palm crossed.

530
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,877
Two hundred and fifty big ones.

531
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,311
Quarter mil for us?

532
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:42,283
''Us''? What are you talking about, ''us''?

533
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,152
Uncle, why do you disrespect me
in front of my friends?

534
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,526
l'm disrespecting you?

535
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,695
A year ago
you were washing my pots and pans.

536
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:58,692
Well, l don't wash
fucking pots and pans anymore.

537
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,236
l'm a part of this Uncle.

538
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:05,130
Nephew, this is not my first barbeque.

539
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,835
He's with us.

540
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:12,708
ls he?

541
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:19,322
And is my nephew here
pulling his own weight?

542
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,024
A lot of heart.

543
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:34,333
<i>Ahora,</i> Gorgeous George is running
the show right now for little Yaka.

544
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:39,876
And if anyone knows where he is,
it's that fat, fucking ugly <i>perico.</i>

545
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,437
l'll get it out on the wire.

546
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,965
Anybody hungry?

547
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,865
-Maybe we should stop at an lHOP or.. .
-Shut up!

548
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,528
Romeo's crying.

549
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,271
Fucking assholes!

550
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,104
Shut up!

551
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,624
Oh, yeah.

552
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,493
Yeah, that feels good.

553
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,644
Somebody had their Wheaties this morning.

554
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,015
Yeah, get after it, girl.

555
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,487
Oh, that's good.

556
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:03,558
Hey, let's keep this professional, baby.

557
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:07,391
No offense,
but l don't need you calling me all the time.

558
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,002
What the fuck!
l'll kill you, you fucking bitch!

559
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,377
What the fuck did you just say to me?

560
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,846
l'm sorry l called you that.

561
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:29,078
How courteous of you to apologize.
Courtesy is so important, don't you agree?

562
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,185
Yeah. Yeah, l'm down with that.

563
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,193
Good. Now sit your fat ass down.

564
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:58,078
Where is Concezio Yakavetta?

565
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,685
-l don't know.
-Yeah, there's a lot you don't know, hoss.

566
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:07,189
For instance,
you're the only New York guy, George.

567
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,590
Your blood just ain't quite as blue
as the rest of them, is it?

568
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,389
Explains why you ain't safely tucked away
in some ivory tower

569
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:17,627
with the rest of them bigwigs sucking on
cannoli and cocktail shrimp right now.

570
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,226
That's why you're the one
he left on the streets, George.

571
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,205
Like you know shit all of a sudden.

572
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,640
Somebody's got to run
our legitimate businesses.

573
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:31,544
-Somebody's got to be out there making.. .
-Someone's got to chum the waters.

574
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:36,984
Bullshit! And l ain't saying
another fucking word to you!

575
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,315
Good. You can just listen.

576
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:42,289
We know Concezio had that priest killed.

577
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,263
That's another thing you don't know,
l reckon.

578
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:50,160
But then why would he tell you
that, George?

579
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,996
You and your boys on the street,

580
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,763
y'all is bait.

581
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,503
Gorgeous George, huh?

582
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,499
Expendable George is more like it.

583
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:08,148
By the by, you've got a pretty nice ass
for a fat man.

584
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,850
A priest. Sick fuck, huh?

585
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,483
So, until the Saints get popped,
we're all lambs to the slaughter.

586
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,690
And he don't care how many of us
they wipe out in the meantime.

587
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,198
What do you need me to do, Skip?

588
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,800
-Down the <i>brugliones.</i>
-What, everyone?

589
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,930
North and South?
That could get a little dicey.

590
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,066
-Fuck their old grudges! They're all in this!
-Grudges have nothing to do with it.

591
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,473
-You know l don't take sides.
-l don't care, Jo Jo!

592
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,602
-You know l don't.
-You don't take sides?

593
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:36,804
-Never me! Never me!
-You don't take sides?

594
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,779
You're gonna take my fucking side
on this, Jo Jo!

595
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,679
-You talk to that mick Jimmy Green.
-Here we go again.

596
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:43,650
-Jimmy'll tell you that!
-Jimmy Green! Jimmy Green!

597
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,451
l don't care if Jimmy Green hollowed out
your sister like a Chippewa lndian!

598
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,024
You're gonna get in there, Jo Jo,

599
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,559
and you're gonna middle-of-the-road
this fucking thing for me,

600
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,629
and you're not gonna fuck it up!

601
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,324
You tell them everything that we discussed!

602
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,526
Even the panic room thing?

603
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:00,727
Sure.

604
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,704
Good. Because that's a nice icebreaker.
They'll like that.

605
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,307
You know,
l didn't even know those things were real.

606
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,843
l thought they made that up for that movie.

607
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,379
Remember the one
with the broad and the kid?

608
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,345
The guys in the house?

609
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,043
<i>Panic... Panic Room?</i>

610
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,813
-No, the other one.
-Stop fucking around!

611
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:21,550
This is serious shit here, Jo Jo!
You tell them we meet tomorrow night.

612
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,216
-All right.
-l'll call you with the fucking location.

613
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,851
-Okay.
-Fucking thing.

614
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,256
Come on, kid. lt was a fucking.. .

615
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,225
lt was a fucking accident.

616
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,591
We can work this out.

617
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,600
He ain't gonna do shit.

618
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,804
You're ltalian Kid.

619
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,763
Help us out here.

620
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,134
Think it over.

621
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,708
l am his friend.

622
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:18,145
Fuck him and fuck his friend.
Deal the cards! He ain't got the balls.

623
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,993
What did we do?

624
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,324
Connor.

625
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:24,810
God! No!

626
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,228
Why did they use his mug shot?

627
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,057
What? No.

628
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,868
Yeah, you remember
when he said he was all embarrassed

629
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:53,806
because that fellow had to hold up
all his long hair behind his head?

630
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,002
Aye.

631
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,413
That's an arm.

632
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,585
Hey, Rocco!

633
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,813
<i>l got the info you wanted,</i> mijo.

634
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:12,557
The place is called
Tando's Tanning Salon on Bunker Hill.

635
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,494
That's where the fucking <i>gero</i>
gets his fake bake at.

636
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:25,007
European cut. Far superior.

637
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:31,874
<i>Yeah! You've just been paid</i>
<i>So split now</i>

638
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:37,917
Lovely singing voice there, Georgie.
We'd like you to sing for us.

639
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,279
Can you do that for me?

640
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,789
Can you do that for me?

641
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,426
lt's getting hard to be a gentleman
of fucking leisure around here!

642
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:56,572
l want the name of the shooter
you motherfuckers used on that priest!

643
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,197
What priest?

644
00:52:58,308 --> 00:52:59,468
His fucking name!

645
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,043
-l don't know who it is!
-That's fucking bullshit!

646
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,613
lt's the truth! Concezio didn't tell nobody
what he was doing

647
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,215
'cause he knew
nobody would have okayed it!

648
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:10,582
The shooter's an independent contractor!
That's all l fucking know!

649
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,417
Where the fuck is Yakavetta hiding?

650
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,924
Prudential Building, 40th floor.

651
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,884
Jesus Christ!

652
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,230
You meeting someone tonight?

653
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,331
Yakavetta's racket chiefs. Street guys.

654
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:34,275
Your kind of guys.
You could take a real bite out of crime here.

655
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,641
-And l can help you.
-What the fuck is that?

656
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,647
Nobody forgot
what you guys did to us last time.

657
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:43,082
Everybody's hiding indoors.
They give out the location an hour before.

658
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:46,314
My uncle's place is closed tonight.
l got the key.

659
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,825
How does Mexican work for you, George?
Do you like that?

660
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,954
Doesn't matter to me.
l think l just shit my European-cut Speedos.

661
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,266
-What's this?
-Rosary bead.

662
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,462
Found it pushed under the carpet
near the victim.

663
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:06,338
Father McKinney wasn't wearing a rosary,
so it's probably been there a while.

664
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:13,608
The results on all 864 prints
found at the scene.

665
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,948
All matched churchgoers and clergy but one.

666
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:22,121
Partial on the priest's watch
is still unidentified.

667
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:26,855
No. No, that's horseshit.
Everybody gets printed nowadays.

668
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:31,058
They even are inking up these snot gobblers
in kindergarten now.

669
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,567
lt's a brick wall anyway.

670
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:38,231
We know Napoleon was wearing gloves.
The lab got zilch on the lock and chain.

671
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,843
Even the pennies came up clean.

672
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,174
l'm gonna go powder my nose.

673
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:49,552
Man. Daddy would knock that out
like Mike fucking Tyson.

674
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:53,355
-Hey!
-What? l didn't say nothing.

675
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,159
McKinney wore his watch on his left wrist.
Where was this found exactly?

676
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,729
Right here, off his left elbow.

677
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,424
Just occurred to me that priests
wear the rosary while taking confession.

678
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,056
-She's right.
-Dolly, get on the phone

679
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,066
and find out which wrist
he wore his rosary on.

680
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:09,262
Duffy, push that partial through the DMV.

681
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,533
David, you put it through lnterpol
just to get an lD now.

682
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,541
Come on, vamoose!

683
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,915
You took your gloves off,
didn't you, cowboy?

684
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:31,585
Now why would you go
and do a damn fool thing like that?

685
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,798
Just two more to go.

686
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,105
You guys are gonna let me go, right?

687
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,608
l guess we'll just have to wait and see,
won't we?

688
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,305
Jesus Christ, this is some embarrassing shit.

689
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,984
Don't worry. We worked on a sheep farm.
Smelled way worse.

690
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,244
Although that is right up there.

691
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,159
Yo, spicaroo.
More nachos and <i>ms salsa, capisci?</i>

692
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,155
Hey, and l need a refill here, pepe.

693
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,831
Easy! Jesus!

694
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,467
-How do, David?
-Hey!

695
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,610
<i>We just dumped a text message</i>
<i>from George's cell. Just two words.</i>

696
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:04,317
''Silver Peso.' '
lt's a Mexican joint down by the docks.

697
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,782
Sent it to his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama.

698
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:10,553
Guess gangsters got to eat, too, huh?

699
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:15,220
l think l'll drop in on their little supper,
see if l can shake things up a bit.

700
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:17,961
Need a bodyguard?

701
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:21,326
No, thank you, Mike Tyson. Bye, now.

702
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:23,199
Bye.

703
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:35,875
These dagos are getting antsy, man.
l'm getting spicarooed and pepe'd.

704
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,544
All right, calm the fuck down.

705
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,750
You got to stick it out.
Just wait on one more.

706
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,993
He is not with them.

707
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,397
lt is only the sons.

708
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,532
They have a Spaniard with them.

709
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,602
They will slaughter everyone.

710
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,375
Let them.

711
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,703
lf you kill the sons.. .

712
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,706
...the father will come.

713
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,217
Gentlemen.

714
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,386
All right. The gang's all here.

715
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,185
Give me my fucking BB gun.

716
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,625
No, Rome. You've earned your stripes.

717
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,129
Hey, tighten it up.

718
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:35,968
So?

719
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,645
Where's Gorgeous?

720
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,582
ls that George?

721
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,065
What the fuck is that?

722
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,793
lt's lrish for, ''You're fucked.' '

723

<i>Que viva Mxico,</i> bitches!

00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:45,271
You guys have really turned me around
on this. l'm, like, born again and shit!

726
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,212
Should we let him go?

727
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:53,148
You know what l think we should do?

728
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,555
l think we should let God decide
if he gets a second chance.

729
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,524
What the fuck you doing?

730
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,061
What the.. . No, man, come on.

731

Hey, what the fuck you gonna do?

732
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,805
You had best be right with your Jesus, boy.

733
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:24,981
Well! Praise be to Jesus!

734
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:32,559
-Georgie.
-Yeah?

735
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:35,255
You know all good boys go to heaven.

736
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,699
You know, that was perhaps one of
the finest examples of spiritual guidance

737
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:45,069
-l've ever had the good fortune to witness.
-lt was wonderful, wasn't it?

738
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,574
Mysterious ways, l tell you, mysterious ways.

739
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,701
You know, it's about time
one of your fucking plans.. .
