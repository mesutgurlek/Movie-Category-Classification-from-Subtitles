1
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:53,743
16th december

2
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,035
The war between India and Pakistan
had come to an end

3
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,160
the Pakistani army surrendered
to the indian army

4
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,785
there was a new Bangladesh

5
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,160
After the Indian army left...
the 2 boys didn't understand...

6
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:27,161
whether what happened to them
was good or bad

7
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,868
will the new country give them
new dreams?

8
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:37,077
they were thinking

09
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,077
move move fast....

10
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:40,702
when Bangladesh was created
there was 1000's of people

11
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:28,805
are you hungry? Will you have food to eat?
Will you work for me?

12
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:45,430
If you give us food...
what ever you say will be done...

13
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:02,555
Vikram and Bala were the main leaders

14
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:10,055
no one would suspect
the small boys

15
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:39,847
Vikram and Bala were Latiff's gun couriers

16
00:04:56,722 --> 00:05:01,739
hey Lattif guns will keep on selling
sometimes think of me too

17
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:14,347

18
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:21,138

19
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:27,305

20
00:05:34,388 --> 00:05:36,597

21
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:41,388
the boy understands...
I said go.....

22
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:16,388
what will he do with vikram?
I am going to get him, say something

23
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:56,888
sir I beg you  let me go

24
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:25,513
put the gun down
I said open his hands

25
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:38,805
don't come near me

26
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:28,763
we killed the police

27
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,638

not spare you

28
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:38,722
a train is going both of you go from here

29
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:03,597
no one is here
go go go...

30
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,346
try to save your anger

31
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,096
I have cooked something for you

32
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,846

33
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,680

34
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:48,305

35
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:04,597
now we will starve to death

36
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,888
wait 1 minute

37
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:32,585
how much are you selling this charcoal for?
-2 rupees 10kg

38
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:35,213
its expensive
today the price will go down

39
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:55,880
lets go bala... where?
the charcoal that saved us will now feed us

40
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,380
do you want to buy charcoal?
-from you ?

41
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:11,922
we will give 10kg for 1 rupee

42
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:33,404
put the money in the hand

43
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:52,421

-For what?

44
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:53,422

00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:57,421

You must see one day I will
drive that car...

49
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:22,421
What happened brother?

50
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:32,921
Do you know our names?

51
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,421
Why rob the train?

52
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:41,921
The train you looted was
Dibakar dada's

53
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:46,421
Does Dibakar dada belong to the government?

54
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:07,921
Do not show me your bravery

55
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:10,421
You will answer for your deed's

56
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:18,921
One minute!

57
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:34,421
Can you tell me something?

58
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,921
When will his next train go

59
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:57,421
Go and tell him we will once again
loot his train...

60
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:07,921
If he has guts try and stop us.

61
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:52,421
Who is Dibakar from you all?

62
00:24:57,921 --> 00:24:59,921
It seems you are
because you look angry...

63
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,421
Bastard's you come on my train
and show me your strength...

64
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:46,921
Is the game over?

65
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,421
This train is mine...
and so is the coal.

66
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:20,921
Now tell me... whose train is it?

67
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:23,421
Its mine

68
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,921
This train can never be yours

69
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,421
Ask me why?
Cause you are bangladeshi refugees

70
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:10,921
Its been a dangerous mission

71
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:29,421
It was not only about coal
Also about fish

72
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:42,921
Both have ruled calkutta

73
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,421
They were small time goons
Now they rule entirely...

74
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:17,921
they are focusing on one thing

75
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:29,421
We don't know how to read

76
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:33,921
Vikram bose nice childs play

77
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:43,421
Names of school and hospital
Was under their control

78
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:02,921
They only wished for two things
in Calkutta...

79
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:14,421
Calkutta's biggest goons

80
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:42,921
There is a story behind a twist.

81
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,421
I am a policeman

82
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:07,921
I should not have called you
If I had my best officers

83
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:10,421
Satya, I have pressure from the high post

84
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:15,921
Election

85
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,421
There is a saying
Bring goons no the right path...

86
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:24,921
We need to clean the streets

87
00:32:26,421 --> 00:32:28,421
This is the governments job
How can the police help?

88
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:30,921
You are right
Banerji

89
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,421
So many files

90
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:41,921
There are only two names to mention

91
00:32:58,421 --> 00:33:00,421
These files has all the evidence
since their childhood

92
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,921
No evidence...
no witness...

93
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:37,421

94

I know this is a gent's toilet...
But what can I do? the ladies was full...

125
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:36,121
That is why, I came to the gents

126
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,621
I said sorry
But this is wrong

127
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:57,121
Why?

128
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,621
Is there licence for ladies to enter
gents toilets? Is this a government notice?

129
00:42:07,121 --> 00:42:09,121
Don't act smart...
Do your job

130
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:19,621
What is this brother?
Bomb

131
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:24,121
It blew up and went away

132
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:52,821
Are you done?

133
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:01,321
What happened?
Did you loose something?

134
00:47:09,821 --> 00:47:11,821

135
00:47:14,321 --> 00:47:16,321
Its your luck

136

The day you drop...
I will pick you up

137
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:53,321

00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:00,821
Two hearts and one love!

139

Toss a coin
See who wins the bet

142
00:49:15,961 --> 00:49:17,961
She is looking like a Goddess

143
00:49:22,621 --> 00:49:24,621
She looks 100% Kali maa

144
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:33,121
Hey you! Come over here

145
00:50:36,621 --> 00:50:38,621
Don't show me your teeth...

146
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:42,121
What are you doing here?
-Nothing

147
00:51:11,621 --> 00:51:13,621
This is a small gift from me to you

148
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:18,121
Are you giving me a gift?
A fish

149
00:51:29,621 --> 00:51:31,621
Are you acting smart?

150
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:54,121
Can you make a knot?

151
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:56,621
Come fast...
The show is going to start

152
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:10,121
Why is your hand shakey?

153
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:23,621
You have forced me into this

154
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,121
I came to tell you this

155
00:53:32,621 --> 00:53:34,621
You came that day by mistake
And I came today by mistake

156
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:37,121

00:55:36,621 --> 00:55:38,621
What is going on?

162

This is the first time
I had this type of offer

168
00:56:34,121 --> 00:56:36,121

Love is red and dangerous

186
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,121
When a pistol shoots at you...
You are finished
