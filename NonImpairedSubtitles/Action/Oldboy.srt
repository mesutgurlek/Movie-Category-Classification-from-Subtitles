Yes, you just write that

00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:55,889
<i> Marie, he should be in bed
at least a week. </ I>

457
00:56:56,009 --> 00:56:59,310
<i> He can not move themselves,
for then skips stitches. </ I>

458
00:56:59,912 --> 00:57:04,025
<i> He has lost a lot of blood.
Is he lying, he comes out. </ I>

459
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:08,581
A half inch on each side,
and it had been quite different.

460
00:57:09,523 --> 00:57:14,405
- I appreciate really here, Tom.
- He should be at the hospital.

461
00:57:14,438 --> 00:57:17,158
- It will not go.
- Why not?

462
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:23,479
Someone tried to kill him.
Should not we call the police?

463
00:57:23,513 --> 00:57:26,847
- I'm asking you not to.
- He is not a herrelřs dog -

464
00:57:26,882 --> 00:57:29,478
- or a bird with a broken wing.

465
00:57:29,598 --> 00:57:32,492
I know you love the hĺblřse coincidence, -

466
00:57:32,498 --> 00:57:37,686
- but sometimes we'll meet people
and fall back into an old pattern.

467
00:57:37,706 --> 00:57:42,093
Do you think I'll shoot again?
Do you believe it?

468
00:57:42,571 --> 00:57:44,540
Fuck you.

469
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:04,956
Come in.

470
00:58:06,613 --> 00:58:10,011
Hello. I just wanted to see you.

471
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:20,418
I will just look at your wounds,
if it's okay.

472
00:58:20,888 --> 00:58:24,750
Turn yourself just a little.
Sorry.

473
00:58:27,014 --> 00:58:31,517
Bleeding has stopped.
It's a good sign.

474
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:38,914
I can not tell you or Marie,
what I should do.

475
00:58:39,205 --> 00:58:42,642
But I can tell you one thing.
She has gone over much.

476
00:58:42,662 --> 00:58:48,096
If it is something that she does not need
it is to get hurt.

477
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:53,366
Please do not hurt her.

478
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:03,785
He likes you.

479
00:59:07,673 --> 00:59:10,020
Can you too like him?

480
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:14,395
No, it's been a long time.

481
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:19,431
He still likes you.

482
00:59:20,252 --> 00:59:23,376
I got your clothes cleaned.

483
00:59:24,587 --> 00:59:29,307
However, they are not overlapped with the hole.

484
00:59:33,377 --> 00:59:35,821
Let me help you.

485
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,837
You should go. Come on. Go.

486
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:04,275
Come on.

487
01:00:04,998 --> 01:00:09,359
- Really?
- Do not come back. Get out.

488
01:00:09,734 --> 01:00:10,628
Get out of here.

489
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:20,992
So, ladies and gentlemen.
Last udskćnkning before closing time.

490
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:24,398
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

491
01:00:31,492 --> 01:00:32,434
Hello? WWW.SUBTITRARI.PRO

492
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:34,826
Hello? WWW.SUBTITRARI.PRO

493
01:00:57,602 --> 01:01:01,299
Hello. I thought it
's about time to meet each other.

494
01:01:01,879 --> 01:01:03,690
Joe, what are you doing?

495
01:01:07,217 --> 01:01:08,377
KRL down!

496
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:10,165
KRL so down!

497
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:19,587
If you kill me, you die within a
seconds. Without knowing why.

498
01:01:23,718 --> 01:01:25,047
Stop then!

499
01:01:25,771 --> 01:01:32,270
I have your daughter. If you want to see her
alive again, we should proceed without violence.

500
01:01:34,106 --> 01:01:37,174
Can I see your list?

501
01:01:44,915 --> 01:01:45,701
No.

502
01:01:46,632 --> 01:01:49,520
It is not beneficial to you.
Trust me.

503
01:01:50,593 --> 01:01:53,457
I have a suggestion, Joseph.

504
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:57,722
If you accept and through with,
you will be amply rewarded.

505
01:01:58,409 --> 01:02:04,190
First with a video of your wife's
rape and murder.

506
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,988
Donna Hawthorne.

507
01:02:07,047 --> 01:02:10,080
- Look at the camera.
- No!

508
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:16,003
I do not see it.
Turn it off.

509
01:02:16,507 --> 01:02:17,495
Say: "Farewell."

510
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:24,188
- Turn it off!
- Well.

511
01:02:24,506 --> 01:02:25,999
Second gets you:

512
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:31,729
My hĺndskrevne confession
of this deed.

513
01:02:32,571 --> 01:02:35,893
And your bortfřrelse
and indespćrring.

514
01:02:36,809 --> 01:02:40,660
Third...
And it is my favorite -

515
01:02:41,503 --> 01:02:44,994
- $ 20 million in diamonds.

516
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:52,039
Finally, and again only in case of
that you manage -

517
01:02:53,483 --> 01:02:58,108
- I'm gonna shoot me a bullet in your head.
And you are welcome to watch.

518
01:02:58,385 --> 01:03:01,083
Answer two questions.

519
01:03:02,006 --> 01:03:05,569
First of all:
Who am I?

520
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:12,041
Second:
Why I entertained you indespćrret 20 years?

521
01:03:12,587 --> 01:03:17,770
Answers to both questions
satisfactory in -

522
01:03:18,758 --> 01:03:22,393
- 46 hours from now, you won.

523
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:26,894
Refuse to participate, this corresponds
to fall short of the target.

524
01:03:27,087 --> 01:03:29,911
You remain a fugitive of the law.

525
01:03:30,032 --> 01:03:35,704
'll Get no reward or sjćlefred.
And I'll kill your daughter.

526
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:41,627
If you, or someone you know
go to the police or warn Mia -

527
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:44,830
- will be the impact gruopvćkkende.
Especially for her.

528
01:03:44,831 --> 01:03:48,286
If you doubt my determination,
or my influence -

529
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:51,158
- I would suggest that you quickly
possible'll take to your friend Marie.

530
01:03:53,105 --> 01:03:56,196
This is a live broadcast.
What is your answer?

531
01:03:56,317 --> 01:03:57,827
Yes or no?

532
01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:01,770
Yes!

533
01:04:01,892 --> 01:04:06,297
Her address is 629 Cooper Street
You'd better hurry.

534
01:04:16,957 --> 01:04:18,393
Marie!

535
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,593
Good evening, Joe.

536
01:04:30,114 --> 01:04:36,248
I should just enjoy myself with her.
But now that you are here -

537
01:04:37,075 --> 01:04:40,969
- bitch can wait.

538
01:04:41,481 --> 01:04:47,785
Throw him up on the table.
Up with the idiot.

539
01:04:47,906 --> 01:04:50,301
Hold him tight.

540
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:58,849
The last one made me lose my temper
-

541
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:08,684
- I tracked down and tortured in
16 days, according to the rules.

542
01:05:08,803 --> 01:05:11,748
But compared to what
I will do with you -

543
01:05:11,867 --> 01:05:16,128
- this corresponds to an ant
fuck an elephant.

544
01:05:29,415 --> 01:05:30,396
Yes?

545
01:05:31,546 --> 01:05:36,237
I'm sorry, but that's not possible.
A godtgřrelse are in order.

546
01:05:37,051 --> 01:05:41,838
Well, you gave me the address,
and I am extremely grateful.

547
01:05:43,198 --> 01:05:47,267
No, you can not offer me anything,
who can hold me...

548
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:50,235
I have to go to the door?

549
01:05:53,371 --> 01:05:56,316
Hold him tight.

550
01:06:03,518 --> 01:06:04,930
Cortesz?

551
01:06:05,386 --> 01:06:06,631
Cortesz.

552
01:06:08,306 --> 01:06:09,311
Let me get a little space.

553
01:06:13,955 --> 01:06:16,181
Maybe I can still...

554
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:22,237
Thank you for your generosity.
And I thank you -

555
01:06:22,356 --> 01:06:28,345
- To vćrdsćtte my sacrifice.
And a good evening to you too.

556
01:06:31,242 --> 01:06:34,088
You're lucky pig, asshole.
Are you aware of it?

557
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:38,067
Let's get out.

558
01:06:55,161 --> 01:06:56,850
It's okay, Marie.

559
01:07:01,094 --> 01:07:05,265
It's okay.

560
01:07:05,266 --> 01:07:07,566
Sorry... sorry.

561
01:08:07,994 --> 01:08:10,574
One of my friends live nearby.

562
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:15,374
I can sleep with her.
I do not feel safe anymore.

563
01:08:24,152 --> 01:08:25,044
Hello?

564
01:08:28,206 --> 01:08:30,739
Every time he calls,
playing the same tune.

565
01:08:47,017 --> 01:08:51,204
Evergreen Academy.
Ring any bells?

566
01:08:52,869 --> 01:08:55,642
The private school I went to.

567
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,708
It was weird. I can not find anything.

568
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:08,857
Here is something.

569
01:09:09,518 --> 01:09:13,546
- Who is Edwina Burke?
- She was my school principal.

570
01:09:28,883 --> 01:09:32,296
I drank fřrhen. Very much.

571
01:09:34,418 --> 01:09:38,252
I did too.
On top of a lot of shit.

572
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:44,788
This evening, I was close on
to take a sprřjte again.

573
01:09:48,044 --> 01:09:49,925
I'm glad you're here.

574
01:10:18,596 --> 01:10:22,913
Hello, you miss Burke?
Edwina Burke from Evergreen Academy?

575
01:10:23,347 --> 01:10:27,712
Can we talk for a
of your former students?

576
01:10:28,218 --> 01:10:29,305
Joe Doucett.

577
01:10:30,609 --> 01:10:33,000
- Come on in..
- I hope not to bother you.

578
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,991
I was making tea.
Sit down though.

579
01:10:42,048 --> 01:10:44,052
Joseph Doucett?

580
01:10:45,067 --> 01:10:48,809
- Remember him?
- Of course.

581
01:10:49,365 --> 01:10:55,760
He is the only killer in the
motley bunch of students.

582
01:10:56,147 --> 01:11:00,254
And if I told you
Joe Doucett is innocent?

583
01:11:00,662 --> 01:11:04,382
The fact that another man killed her.
One he knew from Evergreen.

584
01:11:04,913 --> 01:11:09,018
- Tell me first who you are.
- I'm sorry.

585
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:13,559
My name is Marie Sebastian.
Have you heard about the innocence project?

586
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:18,060
They work dreamed convicts.

587
01:11:18,664 --> 01:11:21,876
Joseph disappeared 20 years ago.

588
01:11:23,059 --> 01:11:24,653
Excuse me for a moment.

589
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:46,918
Do you believe that it was not he?

590
01:11:47,038 --> 01:11:50,829
There have sprung up evidence that suggests
that he was blamed for it.

591
01:11:51,844 --> 01:11:54,391
It comes as a great relief.

592
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,654
He was a really nice guy.

593
01:11:59,312 --> 01:12:03,181
Donna adored him, but he
vćrdsatte neither it or her.

594
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,545
He was tall thoughts about themselves.

595
01:12:06,929 --> 01:12:08,371
But others are not.

596
01:12:08,756 --> 01:12:11,759
He could even be malicious.

597
01:12:12,552 --> 01:12:15,508
Always with a smile, as if the
was a joke.

598
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:19,675
I saw him a bit like a
lost soul.

599
01:12:22,534 --> 01:12:26,643
You nćvnte the killer
was another student?

600
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:29,623
- I suspect that Joe had enemies?
- Yes, many.

601
01:12:30,008 --> 01:12:35,029
But to do something sĺdant would krćve
something quite unusual...

602
01:12:35,697 --> 01:12:37,908
Yes, but was there any?

603
01:12:38,028 --> 01:12:41,176
Can you get on one?

604
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,131
I can not think of one.

605
01:12:44,829 --> 01:12:47,904
I drove past your old school.

606
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:51,244
- What happened to it?
- They took it from me.

607
01:12:51,363 --> 01:12:53,863
My father built the school.
Stone on stone.

608
01:12:54,296 --> 01:12:59,689
Board sold it to a company.
Since that time the gates closed.

609
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:06,543
Everything is still there. Records, files.
All of the school's history.

610
01:13:07,222 --> 01:13:10,830
- But it has left.
- Goodbye.

611
01:13:11,169 --> 01:13:14,100
Marie?
At the beginning of our conversation?

612
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:18,492
There you said that Joe is innocent.
Not "was innocent."

613
01:13:19,678 --> 01:13:21,858
I assumed he was dead.

614
01:13:25,491 --> 01:13:26,726
Thank you.

615
01:13:35,905 --> 01:13:38,036
Did you go to school here?

616
01:13:38,735 --> 01:13:40,309
It's been a long time.

- I have no idea who it is.

619
01:14:24,253 --> 01:14:26,244
The name tells me nothing.

620
01:14:26,365 --> 01:14:30,290
- What about your classmates?
- Oh, I have not seen in years.

621
01:14:30,411 --> 01:14:35,384
As if assholes want to talk to me.
In addition to you, I hated every one.

622
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:38,179
- Sorry, Joe.
- Do not mention it.

623
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:42,371
I'm trying to figure something out.
I'll call again.

624
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:54,072
We should change your dressing.

- Yes, thank you.

- It told you all, right?
- Jo.

703
01:26:23,371 --> 01:26:28,442
I told Donna and Chucky.
And most of Evergreene.

You have no idea how
hard it was for Amanda.

709
01:26:50,023 --> 01:26:53,905
All the torment. Because of you.

710
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,065
Go on.

711
01:26:57,185 --> 01:27:00,043
First today, I knew
it was your father.

712
01:27:00,662 --> 01:27:03,446
The school had to be found out,
what was happening.

713
01:27:04,162 --> 01:27:08,243
Then left your family
urgently country.

714
01:27:09,681 --> 01:27:12,678
Apparently helped your escape
nor family.

715
01:27:12,798 --> 01:27:17,551
- He feared well the consequences?
- You know nothing about my father.

716
01:27:18,673 --> 01:27:21,148
He knew no fear.
Only for love.

Arthur Pryce was a great man.
And will always be a great man.

- was wonderful, skřnt. And clean.

720
01:27:38,145 --> 01:27:43,106
My father did what he did
to honor and preserve...

722
01:28:45,919 --> 01:28:47,519
Father.

01:29:18,696 --> 01:29:22,658
<i> And he loved me.
You see, Joseph, - </ i>

726
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:28,352
- my sister and I thought that we
had with our father, would last forever.

727
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,165
And that no one could take that away from us.

728
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,732
But it was just exactly what you did.
And yes... -

729
01:29:37,742 --> 01:29:41,538
- Therefore I spćrrede you for 20 years.

730
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:50,025
It seems
that you have won, Doucett.

731
01:29:50,288 --> 01:29:53,882
- Take me to Mia.
- Yes, of course.

732
01:30:12,184 --> 01:30:16,062
Do you know what I find fascinating
, Joseph?

733
01:30:16,099 --> 01:30:22,963
You have always been avoiding making
the most fundamental questions:

734
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:28,208
Why did I let you go?

735
01:30:55,968 --> 01:30:58,588
Watch your head.

736
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:16,586
Welcome to one of the TV series,
that have survived in allerlćngst time -

737
01:31:16,624 --> 01:31:20,285
- even if it only had a single viewer:

738
01:31:21,615 --> 01:31:23,388
You.

739
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:51,032
<i> We adopted Mia shortly after the tragedy. </ I>

740
01:31:51,533 --> 01:31:58,880
<i> Neither her mother or Doucett
had family, so we were lucky... </ i>

741
01:31:58,915 --> 01:32:03,239
- <i> Blessed.
- Yes, it was a blessing... </ i>

742
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:38,127
Is not that astonishing?
People believe everything they see on television.

743
01:32:41,303 --> 01:32:44,073
Thank you, Ashley. You can walk again.

744
01:32:52,053 --> 01:32:53,917
Joseph?

745
01:32:53,952 --> 01:32:56,625
No. No. Mia?

01:32:57,958 --> 01:32:59,555
Mia!

747
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:01,735
Mia!

748
01:33:02,094 --> 01:33:07,563
Oh, Joseph. It's not your daughter.

749
01:33:07,888 --> 01:33:12,862
Ashley is a musician,
and a well-paid actor -

750
01:33:12,981 --> 01:33:17,255
- who has been employed by me

No more Christmas games!
Tell me where she's gone!

753
01:33:27,417 --> 01:33:31,635
Answer the question,
you have never asked.

754
01:33:33,182 --> 01:33:36,124
Why I let you loose?

755
01:33:38,473 --> 01:33:41,289
Tell me. Tell me that.

756
01:33:44,177 --> 01:33:47,494
You know the answer, Joseph.

757
01:33:48,073 --> 01:33:51,490
Deep in your heart, you know
-

758
01:33:51,845 --> 01:33:55,698
- the simple truth.

759
01:33:56,489 --> 01:33:59,133
<i> - Say hello to the camera.
- Hello. </ I>

760
01:34:05,453 --> 01:34:08,151
It took a while -

761
01:34:08,586 --> 01:34:11,025
- to change her name -

762
01:34:11,978 --> 01:34:13,879
- and her records.

763
01:34:16,872 --> 01:34:20,050
Finding the right parents.

764
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:24,444
A insensitive mother -

765
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:30,450
- and a loving father who was
taken from her too soon.

766
01:34:30,485 --> 01:34:34,292
It took me twenty years to create her.

767
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:38,956
A fřlsom and caring woman -

768
01:34:38,991 --> 01:34:41,506
- who aspired to help people in distress, -

769
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:45,884
- because she had overcome -

770
01:34:45,885 --> 01:34:49,686
- an enormously sřrgelig past.

771
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:53,993
A woman
could not do otherwise -

772

CALLING

778
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:39,895
No!

779
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:44,022
You can not make her hurt.

780
01:35:44,057 --> 01:35:47,022
- Who is it?
- Leave her out.

781
01:35:47,057 --> 01:35:49,209

01:36:04,065 --> 01:36:09,460
I will not kill you, Joseph.
This is the reason why I let you free.

787
01:36:14,292 --> 01:36:19,659
So I could experience this moment
with you.

So you could fully understand,
what I had, -

01:36:24,963 --> 01:36:28,136
- and what you took from me.

790

Now that I am free, -

791
01:36:47,966 --> 01:36:51,021
