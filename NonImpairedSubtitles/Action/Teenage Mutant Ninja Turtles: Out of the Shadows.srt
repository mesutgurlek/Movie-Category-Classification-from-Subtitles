- They're in the bag.

on the planet,

- Okay. Hit the button.

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,155
What button? What button?
There are a million buttons.

336
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,280
- Number three. Number three.
- Three, three, three.

can't make it to the extraction point,

then we bring the extraction point to him.

Okay. It's all you, Mikey.

KARAI: But you said...

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,234
Yes, that that would be
irresponsibly dangerous. True.

395
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,280
All right, Donnie,
you've got to get Mikey closer.

Where'd he go?

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,039
It worked!

405
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,789
But... Shredder's location unknown?

406
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
(GROANING)

407
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,835
Where am I?

408
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,992
Does it matter?

409
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,275
I know what you're thinking right now.

410
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,352
Of all the ways you'd like to kill me.

411
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,193
But that would require
you outthinking me.

412
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,353
And no one, no thing
is smarter than the Krang!

413
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,959
Oh, I'm sorry.

414
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,033
Did I get a little tentacle mucus
in your eyes, Shredder?

415
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,080
So you know my name.

416
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,071
Why am I here?

417
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,435
Because you
and your buddy Dr. Stockman

418
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,909
found something of mine.

419
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,036
The teleportation device.

420
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,391
The teleport was
supposed to break me out of prison.

421
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,958
(LAUGHS) But it is capable
of so much more.

422
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,871
That device is part of a machine

423
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,837
called the arc capacitor.

424
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,791
Years ago, I launched
the arc capacitor to Earth's dimension.

425
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,110
But upon entering your atmosphere,

426
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,509
it broke apart into three pieces.

427
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,550
You and Stockman have one piece.

428
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,275
Another is in a museum in New York.

429
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,238
The third is in the Brazilian rainforest.

430
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,392
Collect the other two pieces.

431
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,391
Dr. Stockman should
be inventive enough

432
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,075
to reassemble the arc capacitor.

433
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,559
SHREDDER: And then what?

434
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,959
KRANG: It will open a portal

435
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,031
through which
I can bring my war machine,

436
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,918
the Technodrome, to Earth.

437
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,350
Together, we can bring
the people of your planet to their knees.

438
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,439
I'm interested.

439
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,360
I will help you take down planet Earth

440
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,954
if you help me with my problem.

441
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,957
Four brothers will try to stop me.

442
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,559
Turtles.

443
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,676
I'm aware of your past.

444
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,632
Take this.

445
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,872
It will solve
all your problems with those pests.

446
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,115
I'll see you on the other side.

447
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
(GRUNTING)

448
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,157
Push me back in! (GRUNTING)

449
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,996
Push me in, you stupid robot.

450
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
(GRUNTS)

451
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,119
More!

452
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,199
You idiot!

453
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,616
APRIL: Okay, so he just vanished?

454
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,760
DONATELLO: Wait, wait, wait.

455
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,440
If I run the video
from my shoulder camera

456
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,616
through an electrostatic filter,

457
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,313
we might be able to see
what happened to Shredder.

458
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,197
Come on. Show me something, buddy.

459
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,633
Look! Right there!

460
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,276
It appears to be some kind of
residue from a teleportation event.

461
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,876
Yeah, teleportation event residue, man.
It's the worst.

462
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,155
Does that kind of technology even exist?

463
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,800
Baxter Stockman's been
working on this kind of tech for years.

464
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,576
All of that stuff
that I pulled off of his iPad,

465
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,816
it was full of information
about Shredder and the Foot Clan.

466
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,080
It was like a virtual playbook!

467
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,995
Baxter has to have a backup.
And I bet it's on the mainframe at TCRI.

468
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,919
Donnie, I need something.
What do you got?

469
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,194
Wait.

470
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,080
I know exactly what you need.

471
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,148
Totally plug-and-play.

472
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,436
Perfect. I'll go check it out.

473
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,357
We'll go with. Operate in support.

474
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,199
Wait.

475
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,433
The sun's coming up.

476
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,593
You can't go outside. You'll be seen.

477

- Tell him, Raph.

There was

You shouldn't want them all

is gonna add to her credibility,
you are sorely mistaken.

Shredder mutated them
with the help of Baxter Stockman.
