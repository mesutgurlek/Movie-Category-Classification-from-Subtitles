1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:03,601
Now, can I count on your
support for school trustee?

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,804
I've been thinking of
running against you.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,539
We can't afford a campaign.

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,908
We would like
to buy your business.

5
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,075
She's the midwife.

6
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:13,044
You're doing very well,
and you're very strong.

7
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,947
You're not locking
Gracie up any more.

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,949
Run!

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,150
<i>She says they have
the same tattoo,

10
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,051
<i>Picture of
a two-headed horse.

11
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,254
<i>It was the only way I could
see to get you out of dyad.

12
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,656
<i>Betray my sister?

13
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:25,490
For Kira.

14
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,158
That's not your bloody decision!

15
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,760
What the hell's going on?

16
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:29,194
This is Seth.

17
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,430
They wrote down all my information
in this little notebook.

18
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,933
And then Seth yanked out
a piece of my hair

19
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,301
And put it in a bag.

20
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:36,734
Mommy.

21
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:41,072
Duncan had tissue samples
of the castor original.

22
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,246
My people will get you
out of the country.

23
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:52,517
Now we find Helena
and we finish this shit.

24
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,493
We should close his eyes.

25
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,863
Yeah.

26
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,533
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,072
Okay...

28
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,139
S.

29
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,608
S is gonna know
how to get rid of it.

30
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,909
Either that
or someone she knows well...

31
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,079
I'm not asking her
for anything else.

32
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,015
Then fine, I'll ask.

33
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,250
So, I'm gonna need a bath

34
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,151
After we've cleaned
all of this up.

35
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,654
Jesus christ! What a mess.

36
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,093
- Sarah, we need to talk.
- -shit!

37
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,028
- Art, it's not a good time.
- Talk to him!

38
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,530
- Why won't you talk?
- Because he knows me!

39
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,767
- Sarah, I've got something.
Yeah, just a second.

40
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,801
I'm really sick.

41
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,137
I've been throwing up for hours.

42
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,940
- Open the door!
- Art, one second.

43
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,808
One sec.

44
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,744
- Yeah.

45
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,952
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

46
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,620
What's going on?

47
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,490
It all depends.
What's with you?

48
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,725
Nothing.

49
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,801
Hello, arthur.

50
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,670
- Felix.
- How you doing?

51
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,939
What's up? What do you need?

52
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,076
Oh, that. Yeah.

53
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,578
That's a new project.
That's very fresh.

54
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,814
What?

55
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,082
- Art. Hey!
- Art.

56
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,051
- Art, do not go in there.
- What is that?

57
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,419
- Art!
- What...

58
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,289
okay.

59
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,959
First off, it wasn't us.

60
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,831
Do you understand
the position this puts me in?

61
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,334
We do, art. But can't you
just, like, look away?

62
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,603
It's a dead body,
not a bag of weed.

63
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,672
Well, look away and it too
will go up in smoke.

64
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,474
Very professional,
nothing on you.

65
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,342
Hey, art.

66
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,078
I've got someone
who wants to meet ya.

67
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,181
<i>Hi, art, I'm Cosima.

68
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,450
<i>- Welcome to clone club.</i>
- Oh, shit!

69
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,452
<i>I know. Sorry.

70
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,652
<i>I knew beth.

71
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,555
<i>I knew what
she was going through.

72
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,190
<i>We really miss her.

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,693
Yeah.

74
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,128
Yeah. Me, too.

75
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,832
Um, cos, what's your take
on these glitchy bastards?

76
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,268
'Cause this one's not talking.

77
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,174
You said they were looking
for samples of their original,

78
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,044
That's very interesting. Um...

79
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,079
<i>- Oh. Yeah, here's Scott.
- Hey.

80
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,581
- Hello, lieutenant Scotty.
<i>- Don't call me that.

81
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,183
<i>No, he's like barely a trekie.

82
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,951
<i>He only went
to comic-con, like, once.

83
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,888
<i>And it's "lieutenant commander".

84
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,756
Yeah. Anyway?

85
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,857
Basically, dead guy's
symptomology

86
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,359
Sounds like they have
a design flaw.

87
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,961
- Yeah, like me.
- Only neurological.

88
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,831
<i>Which explains why they need
the original genome,

89
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,732
<i>To find a cure.

90
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,535
<i>But that's just
hypothetical unless...

91
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,738
- Unless what, scooter?
<i>- Don't call me that either.

92
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,442
<i>Unless we examine his brain.

93
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:38,976
His brain?

94
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,612
Okay. Well, chop-chop
then, get over here.

95
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,314
I don't want any part of this.

96
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,317
Sarah, come here.

97
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,722
- Do you wanna see the body again?
<i>Yeah.

98
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,524
I really
shouldn't be doing this.

99
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,493
You don't have to.
You just got back on the job.

100
00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:00,631
Which is how I got a lead
on the prolethean, Mark.

101
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,500
You did?

102
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,149
Gracie?

103
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,758
Gracie?

104
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,373
Come inside.

105
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,775
I went to get us breakfast.

106
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,579
Please, don't leave without me.

107
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,181
It was just across the street.

108
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,249
The baker had a turban.

109
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,885
He said he makes the best cinnamon
buns in the whole county.

110
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,721
Your family will be
looking for us, Gracie.

111
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,960
Damn them, if they
want to ruin our honeymoon.

112
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,196
There's a whole world out there.

113
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,204
Why are we here?

114
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,472
I told you,
we're just laying low.

115
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,807
You sat up again last night.

116
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,544
Why won't you come to bed
with me?

117
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,514
It's not a sin.

118
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,550
We're husband and wife.

119
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,417
I know. It's just...

120
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,253
You can share your secrets now.

121
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,916
Hey, say no to bullies
on the board or in the class.

122
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,719
I will speak to your children
so you don't have to.

123
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,054
Hello, Vera.

124
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,156
Could I talk to you
about Marci Coates?

125
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,857
She plans to
re-zone the district.

126
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,493
And have you seen
her lunch proposals?

127
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,995
Nothing but starches.

128
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:11,829
Sorry, I can't.

129
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,866
You don't have five minutes to
talk about your kids' education?

130
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,170
Alison, honestly,

131
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,306
Someone with your issues
handling my children?

132
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,109
Of course. No, I understand.

133
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,279
Uh, we have something for you...

134
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,147
...From Ramon.

135
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,916
We took over his business.

136
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,085
Bath beads, body lotions,

137
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:37,121
Anything you need to relax.

138
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,126
...oh! Here you go.

139
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,828
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

140
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,329
- Uh-oh.
- Oh!

141
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,598
It's 60 now for the soap.

142
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,369
Though we do offer discounts
for referrals.

143
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:55,206
So, can I count on your support?

144
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,542
Well, tell me about
this re-zoning thing.

145
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,917
At the military academy

146
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,389
The other boys did
the sex things.

147
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,691
They'd chase girls.

148
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,193
But not me.

149
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,962
I was waiting.

150
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,699
I know this town.

151
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,101
Willard Finch lives here.

152
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,604
We're not just
laying low, are we?

153
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,708
Gracie...

154
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,281
I'm not who you think I am.

155
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,585
I told your father
that I went awol,

156
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,522
But the truth is that...

157
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,691
I never left the army.

158
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,428
What do you mean?

159
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,829
It's all about your father.

160
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,432
He stole
valuable scientific material,

161
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,568
I was assigned to recover it.

162
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,711
We brought you in.

163
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,912
- Trusted you.
- Gracie...

164
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,847
- All those years...
- I'm sorry.

165
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,016
- It was all a lie?
- No!

166
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,617
Gracie...

167
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:20,791
We are free of your people,
but we are not clear of mine.

168
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,860
I have to find
something for them

169
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,163
And then I can get out.

170
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,335
That's why we're here?

171
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,705
You're looking for something
my father stole?

172
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:35,639
You think Willard Finch has it?

173
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,510
I think that he hid
certain things for henrik.

174
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:44,048
Gracie, you had to know
that your father had secrets.

175
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,318
No, I don't know!
I don't know anything!

176
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,087
Gracie...

177
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,660
Don't ask me
what for, it's personal.

178
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,929
He has to be back
by the end of the day.

179
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,165
Beth couldn't keep still either.

180
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:05,870
Well, it just doesn't seem like these
people get downtown much, does it?

181
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:06,937
Yeah, well, they all scattered

182
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,273
After Helena torched the ranch.

183
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,543
So, the samples that these
castor guys are after?

184
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,344
Yeah, from the original.

185
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:17,047
Blood slides and skin samples,
that's what Cosima said.

186
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,115
So, what?

187
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,717
You think that
if you find them first,

188
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,652
You can trade Helena for 'em?

189
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,855
Right.

190
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,291
Hey, that's the midwife.

191
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,026
Here we go!

192
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,830
Alexis McGann.

193
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,666
Recognise me?

194
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,671
I'm looking for my sister.

195
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,374
I don't know where Helena is.

196
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,543
I was cast out because of her.

197
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,778
Well, I don't give a shit.

198
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,313
What about him?

199
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,350
Mark fled with Gracie.
He betrayed the family.

200
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,318
Wait, he's with the daughter?

201
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,054
Are they the ones
that took Johanssen's truck?

202
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,389
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:00,658
Hey, look.

204
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,462
Johanssen did something
to my sister, what did he do?

205
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,298
She has a special purpose.

206
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,734
Well, I don't know what that means.
What does that mean?

207
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,004
He harvested her eggs,

208
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,874
And she's pregnant
with his child.

209
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,878
Helena's pregnant by him?

210
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,746
It's a miracle.

211
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,984
I didn't know he would
do it to Gracie, too.

212
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,054
<i>55, that vehicle
was ticketed for speeding

213
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,890
<i>In Halton yesterday
at 18:44.

214
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,925
- 55, roger.

215
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,662
All I regret is breaking bread
with abominations.

216
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,098
Oh, trust me,
if Helena's an abomination,

217
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,267
- I'm much worse.
- Hey.

218
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,471
Next time
she'll bite your head off.

219
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:02,253
Gracie,
I've gotta go and do this.

220
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:11,862
This child inside me...

221
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,732
...You know what it is.

222
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:16,967
Yes.

223
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,840
I can't do it alone.

224
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,643
I'll be there for both of you.

225
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,379
I swear.

226
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,581
Then let me help you.

227
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,383
Willard Finch
is a dangerous man.

228
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,385
If he was hiding something
from my father,

229
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,320
He's not just gonna
hand it over.

230
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,455
I can take care of myself.

231
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:43,260
The last thing we need
is another violent mess.

232
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,498
Have you got a better idea?

233
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,142
What?

234
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,495
Hello, Mr. Finch.

235
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,532
Remember me?

236
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,538
Little Gracie Johanssen.

237
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,608
You really have blossomed.

238
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,875
Yes, sir.

239
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,677
Thank you, Mr. Finch.

240
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,946
- Just gotta say it was a...

241
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,750
- Just a damn shame
what happened to your daddy.

242
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,486
He was a good man, your father.

243
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,389
He always spoke well
of you, too.

244
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:51,261
Kept you under lock and key,
though, these last few years,

245
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,763
Didn't he?

246
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,365
- We have our ways.
- Uh-huh.

247
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:58,769
Well, I remember a time when
he used to bring you up here.

248
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,805
I used to play in your fields
while he did business.

249
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,740
That's right.

250
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:06,276
- Which is why I'm here.
- Oh?

251
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,311
To...

252
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,314
...Collect what you held
in trust for him.

253
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:24,461
There is a storage fee that's
applicable here, it's $1,000.

254
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,531
- I don't have it.
- Ooh!

255
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,967
That's gonna be a problem.

256
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,641
The problem, Mr. Finch,
is your lack of faith in us.

257
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,544
We proletheans make fast friends

258
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,312
But fearsome enemies.

259
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,187
Shall I disrupt my mother's
grief to tell her

260
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,191
That you're holding out
for your 30 pieces of silver?

261
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:08,072
You be sure to give
your family my condolences.

262
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,940
Of course.

263
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,380
So, why did Mark take the girl?

264
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,614
He wanted a chew toy.

265
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,616
Oh, come on, think like police.

266
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,553
Why take baggage on the run?

267
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,922
Love, or a hostage? I...

268
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,591
Art, shouldn't you be
getting back to your real job?

269
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,961
Johanssen was a large animal
vet in Halton in the '80s.

270
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,964
You've got to read
the entire file. He's a ka.

271
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,399
Known associate?

272
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,569
Seriously,
why are you doing this?

273
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,405
I don't know.

274
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,174
'Cause I'm riding
with my partner.

275
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,677
- Art. -Look, I'm not
confused, Sarah.

276
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,848
But you are beth's sister
through and through.

277
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,716
You didn't even know her.

278
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,718
This isn't your fight.

279
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,889
You know, she tried to tell me.

280
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,058
What she was.

281
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,794
She called me the night
that she...

282
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,531
The night she came along and...

283
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,934
I thought it was the pills,
more bullshit.

284
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:14,037
I turned my back on her
when she needed me the most.

285
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,806
You couldn't have known.

286
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,674
Yeah. But I should have.

287
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,211
She was lucky to have you.

288
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,582
Just look up
that asshole ka for me.

289
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,019
Let's get your sister back.

290
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,036
Ma'am, I can explain.

291
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,006
- You killed your brother!
- Virginia, calm down.

292
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,275
He was stage five
in the field. I had to.

293
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,779
If you had followed major
dearden's extraction orders,

294
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,714
He would have been at home.

295
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,750
I'm sorry, mother. I'm sorry.

296
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,952
Hey, he screwed up,

297
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,722
But he had to put Seth down.
It's protocol.

298
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,693
My office. Wait for me.

299
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,604
Oh, shit!

300
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,340
Come here, doc.

301
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:08,151
Bless you, paul.

302
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,953
Oh, yeah.

303
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,989
I'm blessed all right.

304
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,692
<i>What's your 20?

305
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,862
Yeah, that's us. Systems
and weapons check, right?

306
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:23,233
It's getting worse, isn't it,
the defect?

307
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,301
You saw it?

308
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,504
Seth went from asymptomatic
to stage five in a day.

309
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,774
What about Helena? Any help?

310
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,410
We did the stress tests,
the neurocog,

311
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,512
She doesn't have the defect.

312
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,415
Her biology may hold answers.

313
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,983
But the fastest way to a cure

314
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,853
Is still the original
genetic material.

315
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,655
Well, I run field operations.

316
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,757
I want rudy
confined to the base.

317
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,191
But I run the programme.

318
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:52,029
We've lost contact with Mark,
I need rudy back in the field.

319
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,930
I'll go after Mark.

320
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:56,433
You can't.
It gets worse.

321
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,304
The director wants you
in arlington.

322
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,973
Our weapon system
has a glitch, paul.

323
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,842
We are one budget review
from oblivion.

324
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,444
They can't shut us down.

325
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,716
I serve with these men.

326
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,518
We owe them.

327
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:20,857
If you can protect them,
I can cure them.

328
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,927
Just buy us more time
with the director.

329
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:32,903
You okay, Scotty?

330
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:37,040
I could barely get through
the scalp, man.

331
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,475
Oh, god.

332
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,977
Go easy on him, Cosima.

333
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,679
Scott's not a hardened
criminal like you and i.

334
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,449
Once I got to the calvarium
I just...

335
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,617
- Scalpel?
- Yeah.

336
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,255
Hey, you have
done this before, yeah?

337
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:56,059
...YouTube is an
amazing resource.

338
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,161
Scott?

339
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:07,637
No sign of aneurysm.
No, no lesions.

340
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,474
God, is this all we are?

341
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,441
Huh?

342
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:15,512
I mean, some neurons, and axons,

343
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,681
And a few pounds of grey matter.

344
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,816
How about we just get it
back to the lab?

345
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:24,287
Yeah. But, like, when he died
you think what he saw,

346
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,656
It was just
a temporal lobe trip?

347
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,625
...oh!

348
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,095
Or did his soul actually say,

349
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,398
"I'm out of here.
I'm out of this dimension"?

350
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,401
Please, Cosima,
this is weird enough.

351
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:42,372
Scott, a good lab partner should
be metaphysically empathetic.

352
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,640
Tongs or spoons?

353
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,176
- Ah.
- Oh, my god!

354
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,978
Well, I looked.

355
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,579
I shouldn't have looked.

356
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,782
Okay.

357
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,884
Ugh!

358
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,221
Oh, bollocks.

359
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,629
Receptacle.

360
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,974
Hey.
You all right there, Igor?

361
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,576
Still with me?

362
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,083
Tell me what you see.

363
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,756
Bi... Bird.

364
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,862
Um...

365
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,497
Star.

366
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,307
- Knife.
- Close.

367
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,008
Key.

368
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,511
Your aphasia's
improving already,

369
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,846
And so are your motor skills

370
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:59,449
With the help of art
and physiotherapy.

371
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,621
Outside.

372
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,193
Sadly, the Rachel Duncan
Topside knew has passed.

373
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,662
Plane crash.

374
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,133
Delphine?

375
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,936
Um, i...

376
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,072
...Finished?

377
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,642
Let's focus on your recovery.

378
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,578
You're more valuable
than you know.

379
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,050
Horses.

380
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,736
Clear the room.

381
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,918
At ease.

382
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,788
Man, I thought
you were really mad at me.

383
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,023
I am.

384
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,192
Your logs.

385
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,597
Sit.

386
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,775
Her name was patty.

387
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,915
Mark's gone dark.

388
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,750
Man, that guy is such a pussy!

389
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,252
Don't underestimate him.

390
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,088
If he's off task,
just bring him home.

391
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,523
And the major?

392
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,725
I'll handle the major.

393
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,763
Mom?

394
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,735
I saw that star in Seth's eyes.

395
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:02,439
- Oh.
- They took him so fast.

396
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,007
Come.

397
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,578
If there was any chance that
Sarah still had the samples...

398
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,981
I had to try.

399
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,716
My boy.

400
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,598
- Alison, hi.
- Hi!

401
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,634
We heard about
your new business.

402
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,301
Yeah.

403
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,470
Could we maybe get some...

404
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,005
Soap?

405
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:40,377
Yes. We actually have
a special for new customers.

406
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,112
Free sample?

407
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,747
Sure.

408
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,016
How about you? Yeah?

409
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,918
Have you two made your
decision for school trustee?

410
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,521
We're still thinking about it.

411
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,325
Don't think too hard.

412
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,699
Soap is the perfect cover.

413
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:06,236
- Ali, we're gonna break even in months.
- Mmm-hmm.

414
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,638
We should have been
drug dealers years ago.

415
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,272
Mmm-mmm.

416
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,142
Pharmaceutical entrepreneurs,
donnie.

417
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,743
As long as every new customer

418
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,913
Is a vote against
Marci flippin' Coates.

419
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:20,016
...hello!

420
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,384
Hi, Marci.

421
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,354
Oh, the kids said that
you were in the garage.

422
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,989
You shouldn't be back here.

423
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,793
There is fumes and lard.

424
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,928
Well, this is, uh,
quite the operation.

425
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,632
I had no idea
soap-making was so involved.

426
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,033
Would you like a lesson?

427
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,103
Enterprising,
and a head for politics.

428
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,172
That's quite the dark horse.
What's her secret?

429
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,874
Oh, you know, just good
old-fashioned stumping, Marci.

430
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,378
We can't all be the incumbents so
some of us have to work for it.

431
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,582
So, Alison, I have
a little proposal for you.

432
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,850
Hmm.

433
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:57,687
I can get you an amazing
deal on this house.

434
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,390
The sellers are very motivated.

435
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,659
This is in a different
school district.

436
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,527
Honey,
they have a salt-water pool.

437
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,930
- Oh, look at that.
- Donnie!

438
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,367
Look, Alison,

439
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,169
You can buy a few votes
with your soaps

440
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,339
And you can quite possibly
carve out some of my support,

441
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,209
But you can't actually win.

442
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,245
Go sell a house, Marci.

443
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,650
Do you seriously think
that people are gonna

444
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,954
Trust their children
to an infamous alcoholic?

445
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:31,721
Why not?

446
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:35,692
They trusted a conniving
second-rate realtor.

447
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:39,262
May the best woman win, Alison.

448
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,364
Goodbye, Marci.

449
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,371
I need to cut something.

450
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:02,652
Drop your accent,
this isn't scotland yard.

451
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,356
Willard Finch.

452
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,491
This is private property.

453
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,194
Well, you're a long way
from home, son.

454
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,063
That's funny. I don't look
a thing like your son.

455
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,465
That you wouldn't.

456
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,801
We're hunting this guy.

457
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,936
- Can I?
- Yeah.

458
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,906
Nope. I don't know.

459
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,942
He's travelling with the
daughter of henrik Johanssen.

460
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,277
Who's that now?

461
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:27,577
Henrik.

462
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,346
He was part of your little
militia back in the day.

463
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,915
"My little militia"?

464
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:32,482
You remember?

465
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,052
Back when the feds dug up all
those guns in your cornfield.

466
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,754
What's your point?

467
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,055
One tip to the feds,

468
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,557
And they backhoe
the whole thing again,

469
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,725
Looking for your little arsenal.

470
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,829
Okay.

471
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,497
I don't know
your friend here, okay?

472
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,165
This idiot, I don't know.

473
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,233
But that daughter,

474
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,969
Young Gracie, she did swing by.

475
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,439
What for?

476
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,209
Just to pass on the sad news.

477
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:02,245
Women running things
over there now too, huh?

478
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,614
What is this world coming to?

479
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,916
Is there anything else?

480
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,785
Bye.

481
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,121
We'll be in touch.

482
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:42,418
You're banished.
We have no use for a midwife.

483
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,686
Wait!

484
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,890
I know where
mark may have taken Gracie.

485
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,983
It's just junk!

486
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:17,720
There's no
test tubes, no slides?

487
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:18,922
This is what he gave me.

488
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,790
Biological samples
need to be kept cold.

489
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,293
Did you see, like, a tank
or a cooler?

490
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,628
- No.
- Think, Gracie.

491
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,630
I don't know.

492
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,331
Okay, it's okay. I'll just...

493
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,567
I'm just gonna have to
go back myself.

494
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,968
No, Mark.

495
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,336
...don't worry.

496
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:33,903
It's too risky!

497
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,873
You know what?
Just, um, go down

498
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,944
And treat yourself
to something special.

499
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,112
I'll be back for you in an hour.

500
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,925
Come home safe. Okay?

501
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,962
Don't you dare leave me alone.

502
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,563
I won't.

503
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,000
Never.

504
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,510
We've got, like, six hotels.

505
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,747
They won't give you anything
over the phone.

506
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,216
You've got to go in,
show them his picture.

507
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,685
Shit!

508
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,989
Hey, you've got
real fires to tend there.

509
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,558
I'll finish the canvas
and you just go back.

510
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,760
I'll take the bus back tonight.

511
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:36,165
I showed you a dead clone
in a tub this morning.

512
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,667
No, you did not.

513
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,437
Just tell me you're not
risking your job being here.

514
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,006
Hmm?

515
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,142
You know,
I may not be your partner,

516
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,578
But I know
when you're holding back.

517
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:55,084
Beth called you that night,

518
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,888
Not Cosima, nor Alison.

519
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,492
What is it
you're not telling me?

520
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,497
Just say it.

521
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,837
I've never said it.

522
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,274
You were in love with her.

523
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,813
She was my partner...

524
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:27,617
...And we were
never gonna be together,

525
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,788
But it happened.

526
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,225
You're just as fierce

527
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,227
As she was, Sarah.

528
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,165
And you need my help, too.

529
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,602
You're no good to us suspended.

530
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,304
We need you as a cop.

531
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,474
Beth would want that.

532
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,585
Be careful. Okay?

533
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,254
We're fierce, remember?

534
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,989
Call me if you need me.

535
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,758
Don't leave it too late.

536
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,543
I thought
you'd smell like Sarah.

537
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,278
Another one.

538
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,547
You are the ugliest Mark yet.

539
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,116
Tell me something,

540
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:37,053
Sarah manning,
the gather of sisters,

541
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:42,091
But when she sold you out,
when she gave you to us,

542
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,427
That must've been quite a blow.

543
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:49,031
You come inside,
I tell you about it.

544
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,700
Well, sweetheart,

545
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:51,934
There is nothing more

546
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,270
That I would love.

547
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,639
That's enough!

548
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,478
Just getting to know
the enemy, major.

549
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,079
You have an assignment.

550
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,048
I will brief you
so this time you don't stray.

551
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,751
- Sir...

552
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,391
Dirty paul.

553
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:19,862
He lies with my sisters,
even Rachel.

554
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,999
Come inside.

555
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,002
Have another.

556
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:28,271
You won't believe me,

557
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:32,742
But I am sorry
it has come to this.

558
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,110
Mmm.

559
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,280
One day, I kill you all.

560
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:02,572
Forgive me my trespasses
against the family, lord.

561
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,340
Please keep Mark safe,

562
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:08,311
And help guide us
through this uncertainty.

563
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,446
Amen.

564
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,386
Do you know who I am?

565
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,956
Are you Sarah?

566
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,562
Helena told me about you,
I didn't really believe her.

567
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:30,533
Yeah, she tells
some nutty stories.

568
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,535
I'm lookin' for her.

569
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:33,603
You'll have to try at the ranch.

570
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,638
- I don't know where she is.
- And Mark?

571
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,773
He and his brothers know
where she is.

572
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,645
My husband
doesn't have any brothers.

573
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,479
Husband?

574
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,716
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

575
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,151
You're the first person
I've told.

576
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,222
Did Helena tell you
I have a kid?

577
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,024
Yes.

578
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,560
My kid and yours
are going to be cousins.

579
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,363
I know you're carrying
Helena's baby.

580
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,833
That does not make us family.

581
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:07,069
Why, 'cause we're abominations?

582
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,041
I don't really know
what to think any more.

583
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,611
Yeah, there's a lot
mark's not telling you.

584
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,213
He was sent by the army.

585
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,116
He had to collect scientific
material from my father.

586
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,118
I know. He told me.

587
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:27,089
Didn't tell you about
his brothers, though, did he?

588
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,591
There's probably more of them.

589
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,027
He's...

590
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,329
He's a...

591
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,565
- Hey, hey, hey!

592
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,134
Look.

593
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:42,538
Helena's the mother of your
kid and she's in trouble,

594
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,308
I need to know where Mark is.

595
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:56,652
- Gracie took everything.
- All right?

596
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,120
We got nothing
to talk about here, kid.

597
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:02,491
- Just... You go and tell bonnie that,
would ya? Bonnie didn't send me.

598
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:09,799
In the field there are only
two types of prisoners,

599
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,867
Assets and liabilities.

600
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:16,172
Ahh. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Okay, okay. Okay.

601
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,575
Be an asset, Willard.

602
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:23,779
Where are the rest
of henrik's things?

603
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,749
Okay.

604
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,152
I don't know any more
than what I told ya.

605
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,191
Where?

606
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,761
- Willard?

607
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,253
Hello, Gracie.

608
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,655
Mother.

609
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,160
Your family
cares for you, Gracie,

610
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:15,164
Even as you refuse
to care for yourself.

611
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,635
You've been crying.

612
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,472
I made a mistake.

613
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,942
Mark, he...

614
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,844
He took advantage of you.

615
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,016
Yes.

616
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,118
And your stupidity.

617
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:46,595
We let a wolf into our flock,
and you ran.

618
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,866
I had doubts, mother.

619
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,201
When your father told me

620
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,771
That you would be the one
to carry the child, i...

621
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,774
I struggled.
Lord, I struggled.

622
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,744
But, you didn't stop him.

623
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,281
We're not like other people.

624
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,017
We have a purpose.

625
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:11,554
We still have a purpose.

626
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,592
It's like swiss cheese in here.

627
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,595
Amyloid plaques,
rampant cell death.

628
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,130
Like spongiform encephalopathy?

629
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,300
Yes. Like
creutzfeldt-jakob disease.

630
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,335
He wouldn't have lasted a week.

631
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,472
No wonder they're so motivated.

632
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,411
- Assays done?
- A few, yeah.

633
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,980
Just cross-referencing
against Leda DNA.

634
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,617
Let's see if it brings up
a new synthetic sequence.

635
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,528
- Scott?
- Hmm.

636
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,969
Hello?

637
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,777
- Hello.
<i>- Hey.

638
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,680
You're not gonna believe this,
um, 'cause I don't either.

639
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,551
<i>But I just thought with a few
100 matching base pairs,

640
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,520
<i>But it's almost half a gigabase.

641
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,222
Uh, not a good time, Cosima.

642
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:21,690
Tell her about the loci.

643
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:26,795
Yeah. A dozen short tandem
repeat loci in common.

644
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,198
That can only mean
one thing, Sarah.

645
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,634
In english, I hope.

646
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,304
The boy clones are our brothers.

647
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,708
What?

648
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,147
Shit. Shit.
I've gotta go.

649
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:46,682
Sarah?

650
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:50,653
Hello?

651
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,833
Heart attack.

652
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:17,179
I thought he could take it, but he
must have had a heart condition.

653
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,218
How did you find this place?

654
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,621
I had a chat
with your blushing bride.

655
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,492
Gracie?

656
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,701
What did you tell her?

657
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,737
She knows you're like us.

658
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,542
She knows you're just like us,
a clone.

659
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,144
What have you done?

660
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,347
What I had to
to get Helena back.

661
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,315
Look, I don't care about Helena.

662
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,984
You have to.

663
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,820
She's your sister.

664
00:40:59,023 --> 00:40:59,955
You're lying.

665
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,891
- I'm your sister, Mark.
- You're lying.

666
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,962
We did the science, you're...

667
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,397
You're my family.

668
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,834
You would say anything
to get your sister back.

669
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,236
Think about it, castor and Leda,

670
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:18,874
Two donors,
two originals, siblings!

671
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,848
You are not my family.

672
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,384
Now, I need to go find Gracie.

673
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,722
Mark. Mark!

674
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,092
Mrs Johanssen, please.

675
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:14,196
We shared
everything with you, Mark.

676
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,934
- Our home, our hearts.

677
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,569
Our daughter.

678
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:23,839
Now you'll answer to us.

679
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,008
Please.

680
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,612
I love her.

681
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,183
Not like her mother.

682
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,296
You're the one
with the blessed child.

683
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,864
...guards!

684
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:49,665
You're a shit mother!

685
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,568
- There was a car following me.
- Was it Marci Coates?

686
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,469
My boss wants a meeting.

687
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,204
- Whoa, mister, that my wife!
- Shut up.

688
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,005
I'm not gonna let an app
decide who I love.

689
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,141
Nobody meets anyone
in person any more, darling.

690
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,409
- I'm not. No.
- Why not?

691
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,645
...there you are, mommy.
