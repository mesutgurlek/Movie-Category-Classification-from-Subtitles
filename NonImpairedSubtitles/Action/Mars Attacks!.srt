1
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:30,363
Howdy there, Mr. Lee.

2
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,683
What's this? Filipino New Year's?

3
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:34,766
No. Why you say that?

4
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:36,605
'Cause you're cooking a feast.

5
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:39,082
I can smell it from the interstate.

6
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:41,563
What is that? Barbecue?

7
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:44,162
Yeah. But it not coming from here.

8
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:46,571
What is that noise?

9
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,761
What is your take on this, Jerry?

10
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,682
The people will love it, Mr. President.

11
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:19,404
Our conflict is whether we ambush
the 6:00 news or hold out for prime time.

12
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:21,803
Screw the press.
This is a need-to-know situation.

13
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:25,727
We should make it top secret,
and should move in with Defcon Four.

14
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,730
We can't sit on this.

15
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,688
General Casey, do you have an opinion?

16
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,207
Well, sir...

17
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:35,806
...do we know they are hostile?

18
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:37,724
What do you mean?

19
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40,601
They have the planet surrounded
by thousands of warships!

20
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:42,524
Do we know they're warships?

21
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:48,851
Professor, what do we know about them?

22
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:52,523
They're very advanced technologically.

23
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:55,730
Which suggests, rightfully so,
that they're peaceful.

24
00:04:56,293 --> 00:05:00,491
An advanced civilization is,
by definition, not barbaric.

25
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:02,046
Mr. President...

26
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:03,892
...this is a great day.

27
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:05,884
I and all my colleagues...

28
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:07,725
...are extremely excited.

29
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:09,049
Good.

30
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:12,488
Extraterrestrial life.

31
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:15,165
You're right, Jerry.

32
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:17,762
The people are going to love it.

33
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:20,168
This is a momentous occasion.

34
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:21,809
Mr. President...

35
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:23,645
We'll go all media on this.

36
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,485
I'll wear my Cerruti suit.

37
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:27,245
I'll need a good speech.

38
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,566
Statesman-like...

39
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:31,531
...historical and yet...

40
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,644
...warm, neighborly.

41
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:37,442
Abraham Lincoln meets
Leave it to Beaver, kind of thing.

42
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:40,451
Are they too old-fashioned?

43
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,046
No, I don't think so.

44
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:45,603
This has got the colors but, no.
I don't think so.

45
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,052
Not vivid enough.

46
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:49,164
Nancy had this in the library.

47
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,049
Yes, indeed.

48
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:51,327
I don't think so.

49
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:54,644
I thought perhaps the watered silk.
This week it's on sale.

50
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:57,607
I hardly think I need worry about that.

51
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,293
My husband is the leader of the free world.

52
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:02,852
What do you think?

53
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:07,372
Why don't you leave the Roosevelt Room
the way the Roosevelts wanted it.

54
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:12,126
Because Eleanor Roosevelt was
too fond of chintz. That's why.

55
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:14,524
Mother, this isn't your house.

56
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:17,651
If you're going to be a pest, I'll ignore you!

57
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:18,962
Mrs. Dale?

58
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:43,053
I saw you fight Sonny Liston in '69.

59
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:44,248
Really?

60
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:46,483
You were a nun back then?

61
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:49,690
We've always been fight fans,
haven't we sisters?

62
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:52,163
Byron Williams, telephone.

63
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,368
I must go.

64
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,922
You ladies have a nice time.

65
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,607
Oh, Louise.

66
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,203
Sorry to call you at work, but...

67
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:09,686
...the boys haven't been home
in two nights. I don't know what to do.

68
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:11,844
You're doing the best you can.

69
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:13,765
They're just at that age.

70
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:19,083
The casino manager's giving me
the evil eye. I've gotta go.

71
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:20,885
I'll call you later, okay?

72
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:24,730
Are you still cool on me
coming to Washington?

73
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:26,485
'Course I am.

74
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:29,441
You take care, okay? Bye.

75
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,485
Must you drink in front of me?

76
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:48,564
You're an adult. Just cope.

77
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,770
It doesn't help me
that all we ever do is sit in bars.

78
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:53,685
This is work, baby, okay?

79
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:57,368
I'm checking the decor,
the lighting, the traffic flow.

80
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:00,411
If I'd known you'd turn into a crook,
I wouldn't have married you.

81
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:02,324
I'm not a crook.

82
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:04,563
I'm ambitious. There's a difference.

83
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:07,292
If you think you can make
a nickel in this town...

84
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:10,968
...without knowing how to dally
around a few curves, well...

85
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,853
...you know nothing
of the gambling industry.

86
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:19,206
The Galaxy's going to be
the best hotel in Vegas.

87
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,965
The best!

88
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:22,003
I promise.

89
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:24,561
But don't you realize what you're doing?
You're destroying the Earth!

90
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:27,451
All this greed! This money system!

91
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:29,683
You're destroying everything!

92
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:32,244
Okay, Barbara, okay.

93
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:34,564
Keep your voice down.

94
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:37,204
I got friends here.

95
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:39,403
Sugar!

96
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:41,126
Hit me one more time.

97
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,566
Stop flirting with the waitress.

98
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:43,927
God. Here.

99
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:47,125
Go over to the roulette...

100
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,325
...play our anniversary...

101
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,404
...and stay off of black.

102
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:56,249
Thanks.

103
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:07,013
Make it quick,
we go out live in ten minutes.

104
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,088
What? The actual president?

105
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:11,408
Cutting in?

106
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:18,530
Budget negotiations may be dead
in the water after this week.

107
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:20,171
Hair looks good.

108
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:22,528
I like the hair.

109
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,683
...quote, "factually-challenged. "

110
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:27,165
Yeah, Stone. Speak.

111
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,766
Jason, hi, it's me.

112
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,292
You wearing a bra?

113
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:35,362
Listen, this is big. President Dale
is cutting into my show today.

114
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:39,686
That's absurd. Why would he stoop
to being on "Today in Fashion"?

115
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:41,172
He's interrupting everybody.

116
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:44,529
I don't know, it's some sort of
an emergency announcement.

117
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:47,287
This doesn't make sense.
He should talk to us.

118
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:50,249
White House is coming out live.

119
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,892
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

120
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:57,728
I apologize for interrupting
your regular programs...

121
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:00,771
...but I have a very important
announcement to make.

122
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:04,211
Many important things have happened
to me in my life:

123
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:06,843
My graduation from Princeton...

124
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,689
...the day that Marsha said
she would be my wife...

125
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:13,003
...the birth of our daughter Taffy.

126
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:14,128
Thanks, Dad.

127
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:18,684
And the news that I have heard today
ranks right up there.

128
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:21,083
A powerful memory is in the making.

129
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,405
Not just for me...

130
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,325
...but for all mankind.

131
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:26,568
Today...

132
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:30,049
...an extraordinary discovery
was made by the Hubble telescope.

133
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:34,891
The data from the Hubble was decoded...

134
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:40,130
...then analyzed by the most
powerful computers at MIT.

135
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,883
The images are undeniable.

136
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:46,410
We are entering the dawn of a new era.

137
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:51,208
Frame enlargements provide
an astonishing sight.

138
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:55,844
A fleet of vehicles,
which can best be described as...

139
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:57,606
...flying saucers.

140
00:10:57,773 --> 00:11:00,810
Come on! Come on!
Papa needs a new pair of shoes!

141
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:06,253
Hey, am I the only one
shooting craps here?

142
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:09,962
We hope we will have the chance
to meet with them.

143
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:12,772
This is the perfect summation
to the 20th Century...

144
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:14,206
Martians.

145
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,604
This is great.

146
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:19,652
Please, come to Earth. Please.

147
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:21,567
We need you.

148
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:27,564
I got people coming in!

149
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,452
Everybody wants to be part of this.

150
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:33,252
Galaxy's going to be world class.

151
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,567
And soon...

152
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:38,611
...we will become one solar system.

153
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:40,367
What the hell's he talking about?

154
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:42,921
These flying saucers
have come from Mars...

155
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:47,081
...and at their current course and speed...

156
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:49,005
...will enter Earth's orbit in 16 hours.

157
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:52,847
I've been thinking about Martians
when there weren't any.

158
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:57,644
It is profoundly moving to know
there is intelligent life out there.

159
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:59,246
Glad it's somewhere.

160
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,008
Our world
will never feel quite the same again.

161
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:05,727
Good night...

162
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,490
...and God bless you all.

163
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,887
This...

164
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,286
...is intense.

165
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:26,844
Shut up, Poppy. Shut up.

166
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:29,167
Shut up!

167
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:30,962
Jason Stone.

168
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:34,927
It's for you.

169
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:39,082
Poppy, honey. No, sweetie.

170
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,763
That's right. Good girl.

171
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,091
I could be there at...

172
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:50,604
...I don't know, 1 1:00.

173
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:08,769
They want me to interview
the professor from the White House.

174
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,402
Kessler?

175
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,008
Donald Kessler?

176
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,049
Yeah, I think that was his name.

177
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:17,172
You know, the science guy.

178
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:19,005
This is nuts, this is...

179
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,164
We should have got that guy.

180
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:23,643
Your people are too slow.

181
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,127
Right, Poppy?

182
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:49,968
Finished!

183
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:51,805
One minute, 57 seconds.

184
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:55,403
-Didn't I tell you under two minutes?
-You did!

185
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:56,448
You did!

186
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:57,568
Hot damn.

187
00:13:58,293 --> 00:13:59,612
Want a doughnut?

188
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:00,928
How old are they?

189
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:02,366
Fresh baked, Monday.

190
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:05,013
Richie, that's six days ago!

191
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:06,846
Give me a couple.

192
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:12,762
This Martian thing is pretty awesome.

193
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:16,528
Did one of you traitors see my Muffy?

194
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:18,365
Your brother's volunteering.

195
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:20,523
As soon as I get back to the base.

196
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:21,807
Volunteer for what?

197
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:23,326
Martian detail.

198
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:25,169
Cool.

199
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:28,689
If any Martians come around here,
I'll kick their butts!

200
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,568
Jump!

201
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:53,122
Folks,
we must make an unscheduled stop!

202
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,488
It's Mama.

203
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:01,330
Why are you here?
If you ain't home, why ain't you in class?

204
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:02,448
Class was cancelled.

205
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,886
It was not!

206
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:05,008
-Come here!
-Why?

207
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:06,811
I'm not going to hurt you.

208
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:08,447
Let go of him.

209
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:12,282
Okay. Now just come here.

210
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:13,807
Come here.

211
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:16,605
Think it's smart to cut school?

212
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:18,524
-What are you doing?
-Do you?

213
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:20,608
No, it's dumb.

214
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:22,445
You'll flunk! Go to jail!

215
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:24,365
Get on the bus!

216
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:25,568
Get on!

217
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:28,202
I'll be tripping on you. Get back there.

218
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:29,886
I don't want to hear anymore.

219
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:31,008
I hate school.

220
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:32,287
I heard that!

221
00:15:55,173 --> 00:15:56,208
Hi, there.

222
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:57,408
Want a date?

223
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:58,926
How about it?

224
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:00,447
A date?

225
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:03,921
It sounds good.

226
00:16:06,053 --> 00:16:07,805
The stress at work is...

227
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,646
...unbelievable.

228
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:16,565
May I speak to you in private?

229
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:19,326
No, I must watch the floor.
What do you want?

230
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,283
-I'm supporting a family back east.
-I thought you were divorced.

231
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:26,046
I am, but I still have to take care of them.

232
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:29,885
Things have been a little lean around here.

233
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:31,930
I was wondering if I could get a raise?

234
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:33,162
Out of the question.

235
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,325
I'm an asset to this hotel.
They like me around here.

236
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:38,085
You're a nice guy.

237
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:42,088
But I can get Leon Spinks
or Buster Douglas for the same money.

238
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:45,286
You better get moving.
You're on in five minutes.

239
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:56,482
This show's going to get a great rating.

240
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:58,481
It's all yours.

241
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:04,128
In certain circumstances the proposition
that two and two equals five...

242
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:06,045
...is entirely legitimate.

243
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,046
Call me Nathalie.

244
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:12,126
And you, do please call me Donald.

245
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:14,886
I admire your show.

246
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,642
Really? You like my work?

247
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:21,890
Yes. Very much.

248
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:23,327
Why...

249
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:25,571
Thank you.

250
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,405
Coming out of commercial.

251
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:29,131
In five...four...

252
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:30,885
...three...two...

253
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:34,249
Welcome back.
We're with Professor Donald Kessler.

254
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:39,170
He's the chairman
of the American Academy...

255
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,608
...of Astronautics.

256
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,007
Professor...

257
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:47,524
...isn't it weird that we sent
a space probe to Mars...

258
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,684
...and we didn't even find anyone?

259
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:51,684
Well, not really...

260
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,002
...Nathalie.

261
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:55,683
We didn't get into the canals.

262
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:57,809
The Martian canals are canyons.

263
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:00,123
Some are over 100 miles deep.

264
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:04,963
The Martian civilization has clearly
developed under the planet's surface.

265
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,683
Their science and technology
must be absolutely mind-boggling.

266
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:10,329
So...

267
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:12,324
...what in your view, Donald...

268
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:14,008
...Kessler...

269
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,211
...Chairman, are some of the things
the Martians can teach us, Professor?

270
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:23,002
Quite a lot about Mars, Nathalie.

271
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:27,761
She's flirting.

272
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:31,210
But seriously,
this is tremendously exciting.

273
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:34,371
The knowledge, the new ideas:
it'll change everything.

274
00:18:34,773 --> 00:18:36,604
And we must be open to it.

275
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:39,241
Maybe they can tell us about our universe.

276
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,607
How it started.

277
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:42,206
Where it's going.

278
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:44,523
Perhaps even its purpose.

279
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:46,766
It's tremendously exciting.

280
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:49,413
It's the most important event since...

281
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,883
...Jesus walked in Galilee...

282
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:53,648
Christ.

283
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,405
What's wrong?

284
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:56,767
Go to Camera Two!

285
00:18:56,853 --> 00:18:58,206
I can't. It's busted.

286
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:00,045
Go to One! Go to Four!

287
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:07,726
He copped a feel.

288
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:11,328
Now what?

289
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:25,362
What's that?

290
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,086
So that's a Martian.

291
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:31,566
That's a Martian?

292
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:36,606
Oh, my God!

293
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:37,683
Yikes!

294
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,488
I'm not having that thing in my house.

295
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:45,247
Sweetie...

296
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:48,132
...we may have to.
The people expect me to meet them.

297
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:50,681
They're not eating off the Van Buren china.

298
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:53,966
Look at that brain.

299
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,046
He must be real smart.

300
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:58,124
It's gross!

301
00:19:58,853 --> 00:20:00,525
Don't forget, Nathalie...

302
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:03,161
...that we will look equally gross to him.

303
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,043
He made the international sign
of the doughnut.

304
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:14,765
From the limited information available,
I've made three extrapolations. One:

305
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:17,652
Our Martian friend
is a carbon-based life form.

306
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:19,883
Two: He breathes nitrogen.

307
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,088
And three:

308
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:24,051
The large cerebrum here, indicates...

309
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,364
...telepathic potential.

310
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:28,206
You mean they can...

311
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,806
...read our thoughts?

312
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,766
Potentially, yes.

313
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,003
What about their intentions?

314
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:36,765
Are they friendly people?

315
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:41,483
Logic dictates that given
their high level of technical development...

316
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:43,644
...they're an advanced culture.

317
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:46,452
Therefore, peaceful and enlightened.

318
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:49,483
The human race, on the other hand...

319
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:52,771
...is an aggressively dangerous species.

320
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,611
Now I suspect they have
more to fear from us...

321
00:20:56,773 --> 00:20:58,286
...than we from them.

322
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:00,048
Doctor.

323
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:01,522
Thank you.

324
00:21:02,613 --> 00:21:06,288
For many years,
I've been refining a translating computer.

325
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:09,971
The results are not perfect, but this...

326
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,363
...may answer some of your questions.

327
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:19,446
Green skin...

328
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:22,243
...800 centuries ago.

329
00:21:22,653 --> 00:21:24,166
Their bodily fluids...

330
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,722
...include the birth of half-breeds.

331
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:28,612
How many centuries did he say?

332
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:29,648
Eight hundred, sir.

333
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:31,928
Self-determination of the cosmos.

334
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:35,361
For dark is the suede that...

335
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:36,648
...mows...

336
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:38,884
...like a harvest.

337
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:41,330
What the hell does that mean?

338
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:56,888
Hey, Mitch.

339
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:58,201
Good morning.

340
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,769
I'm sorry, you can't come this way.
There's a tour in progress.

341
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,131
Hello, my name is Barbara.

342
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:13,805
Hello, Barbara.

343
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:18,446
I am an alcoholic,
but I haven't had a drink in three months.

344
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:28,010
I'm feeling so optimistic
because of the Martians.

345
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:30,962
We're not alone in the universe.

346
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:33,204
And it's so perfect...

347
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:36,763
...that it's happening at the beginning
of the new millennium.

348
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:38,804
Our planet was suffering...

349
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:42,249
...with the ozone and the rain forest and...

350
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:46,810
...so many people unhappy in their lives.

351
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,648
And then...

352
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:52,729
...the Martians heard
our global karmic cry for help.

353
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:54,726
People say they're ugly...

354
00:22:54,813 --> 00:22:57,452
...but I think they've come
to show us the way.

355
00:22:59,453 --> 00:23:01,683
I think they've come to save us.

356
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:05,602
Thank you.

357
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:18,808
Bye-bye.

358
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:21,691
You be careful. Don't get yourself killed.

359
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:23,206
Ain't she cute?

360
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:25,682
-We're real proud of you.
-Thanks, Dad.

361
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,326
Let me take this.

362
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:33,607
So long, retard. Don't touch
any of my stuff while I'm gone.

363
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:36,966
Bye-bye, Grandma.

364
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:38,327
Good-bye, Thomas.

365
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:39,766
It's Billy-Glenn, Grandma.

366
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,366
I know, Thomas.

367
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,487
Bye-bye, honey.

368
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,366
I must go.

369
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:01,492
Take care of my boy.

370
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:13,288
He'll be all right.

371
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:14,442
I hope so.

372
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,091
Army trains them good.

373
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,806
He's gone for a while.

374
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:26,002
Why can't you be more like your brother?

375
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:30,246
We got lucky with Billy-Glenn.
You can't expect the same luck twice.

376
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:33,850
Richie, want to make yourself useful
for a change?

377
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:35,048
Sure, Dad.

378
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,044
Take Grandma back to the home.

379
00:24:50,493 --> 00:24:53,803
I bet you never thought you'd live
to see the Martians come.

380
00:24:54,253 --> 00:24:56,084
It's pretty far out.

381
00:24:58,093 --> 00:25:01,608
But think of all the crazy things
you must have seen.

382
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:05,449
I bet people were pretty scared
when they invented the train.

383
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:08,652
Come on, kid, I'm not that old!

384
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:13,207
Are you okay?

385
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,326
I want to see Slim.

386
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:17,767
I want to see...

387
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,127
...Slim...

388
00:25:19,293 --> 00:25:20,567
...and Muffy...

389
00:25:20,973 --> 00:25:22,247
...and Richie.

390
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,612
Grandma, I'm Richie.

391
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,924
I know, Thomas.

392
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:32,721
Richie was always the best one.

393
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:39,684
Right now the president
is talking to other world leaders.

394
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:43,209
They're preparing a list of issues
of common interest to discuss.

395
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:47,525
There is a unilateral, concerted,
diplomatic effort being made.

396
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:50,649
Jason.

397
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:51,449
Thanks.

398
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:55,208
If the Martians land,
can the press do interviews?

399
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,446
Well, that depends.

400
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:59,603
We must establish contact...

401
00:25:59,773 --> 00:26:01,843
...work out communication problems...

402
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:03,207
...establish parameters.

403
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:05,602
Then I guess we just see what happens.

404
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:07,446
Here's the president.

405
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,967
Good morning.

406
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:13,363
It's nice to see you all again.

407
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:17,128
I just have a few minutes for questions,
so let's get started.

408
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:18,487
Mr. President!

409
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:24,330
Do the Martians have two sexes,
like we do?

410
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,727
From Hollywood...

411
00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:46,169
...we bring you the "Lawrence Welk Show"!

412
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:55,365
Here he is, Mr. Music Maker himself,
Lawrence Welk.

413
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:07,928
This pussycat
is the most beautiful pussycat...

414
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,243
...in the whole world.

415
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:12,005
That's my Muffy.

416
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:19,372
Didn't you ever have
a pussycat of your own?

417
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:20,727
Sure, Grandma.

418
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,645
Music!

419
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:28,887
There you go.

420
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:35,045
You going to be okay?

421
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:39,767
If you need anything,
any doughnuts or anything, call me.

422
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,207
How do?

423
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:10,689
Looks like you ain't got no wheels.
Come on...

424
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:12,366
...get in.

425
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:18,923
I'm going to do you a favor.

426
00:28:19,093 --> 00:28:20,128
I owe you one.

427
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:24,126
I made a ton of money
on your last fight in '73.

428
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:25,851
The Quaker in Jamaica.

429
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:28,126
I'm glad somebody did.

430
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:30,284
Yeah, I know, I know.

431
00:28:30,453 --> 00:28:31,932
It's rough on jocks.

432
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:34,205
You get to a certain age...

433
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,165
...opportunities dry up.

434
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,845
So here's the deal.

435
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:43,006
I got this chum, owes me a lot of money,
needs a wake-up call.

436
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,243
What I'd like you to do is...

437
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:48,211
...use that patented left hook on him.

438
00:28:49,093 --> 00:28:51,891
Just in the ring, Art. Just in the ring.

439
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:54,442
Yeah, I'm hip, I'm hip, but...

440
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:56,924
...l'll give you two grand.

441
00:28:57,973 --> 00:28:59,486
When you're done...

442
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:03,566
...all you must do is mosey on
by the office and get the cash.

443
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:05,804
Why do you want to come at me that way?

444
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:08,123
I'm trying to get back with my wife.

445
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:10,602
We had problems with this kind of shit.

446
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:13,085
But I've changed, man.

447
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,368
I found Allah...

448
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,842
...I don't eat pork, I'm a better man.

449
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:20,851
I faced that demon
and I don't want him coming again.

450
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,924
You gave up pork!

451
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,684
They're sending coordinates.

452
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:40,448
Where are they landing?

453
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:42,649
Pahrump. It's in the Nevada desert.

454
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:45,770
I can have my troops there at 0800 hours,
sir.

455
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:49,488
We must not send these people
the wrong message.

456
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,689
We need a welcome mat, not tanks!

457
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:56,210
What are you talking about? You can't
have Martians running all over Nevada!

458
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:57,567
You're right.

459
00:29:57,653 --> 00:30:00,406
-Thank you, sir.
-This situation needs to be supervised.

460
00:30:00,493 --> 00:30:01,926
Absolutely, sir.

461
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,526
General Casey...

462
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:05,325
...can you handle it?

463
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,008
I'd be proud.

464
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:09,448
Good, but keep a lid on it.

465
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:12,366
Key media, good cross-section of guests.

466
00:30:13,173 --> 00:30:15,846
We don't want it to turn
into a zoo out there.

467
00:30:24,813 --> 00:30:27,281
They don't know what
they're talking about!

468
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:29,489
Liberals, intellectuals...

469
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:31,883
...peacemongers, idiots!

470
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:35,723
Would you please keep it down?

471
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:37,485
People live here!

472
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:01,767
General Casey.

473
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:06,290
Yes, I get to greet the Martian ambassador.

474
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:08,365
Isn't that great?

475
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,286
Oh, it's a hell of an honor.

476
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:16,090
Didn't I always tell you if I stayed
in place and never spoke up...

477
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:18,608
...good things were bound to happen?

478
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:26,323
I want the Martians to be treated
like foreign dignitaries.

479
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:29,007
I want your men alert and majestic...

480
00:32:29,173 --> 00:32:31,562
...with a snap in their step.

481
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:35,293
This must look good.
The world is watching.

482
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:36,408
Yes, sir.

483
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:43,648
Are you positive this thing will work?

484
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:46,331
Positively positive.

485
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:48,006
We don't want any slip-ups.

486
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:50,129
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

487
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:13,446
Poppy. All these people.

488
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,528
All of them here to see you.

489
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:20,965
There's Jason, Poppy!

490
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:34,726
Okay, let's go.

491
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:40,084
The teeming masses have gathered
from who knows how many states...

492
00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:41,925
...waiting and watching.

493
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,452
Why have they come?

494
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:45,808
Curiosity? Or is it something more?

495
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:48,727
Or simply to say, "I was there"?

496
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:50,492
"I was there...

497
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,166
"...when first man...

498
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:53,686
"...met Martian. "

499
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:55,169
Jason Stone...

500
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:56,527
...GNN...

501
00:33:56,693 --> 00:33:57,682
...Pahrump.

502
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:30,488
Some room.

503
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:32,371
Give them room.

504
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:24,249
It is an awesome sight.

505
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,246
The giant spacecraft glinting...

506
00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:29,973
...in the Nevada sun like a...

507
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:31,887
...giant...

508
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:33,806
...hubcap.

509
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:37,005
Something's happening.

510
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:43,772
The doorway...

511
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,127
...is opening.

512
00:35:49,173 --> 00:35:50,970
A silver ramp...

513
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:52,566
...is coming out...

514
00:35:53,493 --> 00:35:55,245
...like a giant tongue.

515
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,925
Gee whiz.

516
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:48,367
Martians!

517
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,971
Funny little critters.

518
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:29,368
Well?

519
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:31,169
Wait.

520
00:37:34,773 --> 00:37:35,842
Greetings.

521
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,442
I am the Martian ambassador.

522
00:37:40,853 --> 00:37:43,413
Everything is fixed now. You may speak.

523
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:44,847
Greetings.

524
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,526
I am General Casey...

525
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:51,084
...Commanding Officer of the Armed
Forces of the United States of America.

526
00:37:51,453 --> 00:37:53,967
On behalf of the people of Earth:

527
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:55,122
Welcome.

528
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:57,286
He did that well.

529
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,766
We come in peace.

530
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,643
We come in peace. We come in peace.

531
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:37,443
They came in peace.

532
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:42,085
We come in peace.

533
00:39:10,253 --> 00:39:11,288
Open fire!

534
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:42,728
What?

535
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,722
Die, you alien shithead!

536
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:40,202
I surrender!

537
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:50,001
No, it ain't happening! It didn't happen!

538
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:46,603
Holy Mother of God!

539
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:48,652
Did you see that?

540
00:41:48,813 --> 00:41:52,123
We should hit these assholes
with everything we've got, sir.

541
00:41:52,693 --> 00:41:54,172
Sir, Mr. President,
I know this seems terrible...

542
00:41:54,253 --> 00:41:56,130
...but let's not be too rash.

543
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,692
We should nuke them!

544
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:00,806
We must establish
a line of communication first.

545
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:03,091
Set up a town hall.

546
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:05,209
We'll get the public's opinion.

547
00:42:07,093 --> 00:42:08,811
What do you think?

548
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:12,171
Kick the crap out of them.

549
00:42:13,613 --> 00:42:15,171
Ladies and gentlemen...

550
00:42:15,253 --> 00:42:17,687
...it may be a cultural misunderstanding.

551
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:20,324
Maybe to them, doves mean war.

552
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:25,051
We all saw how they reacted to that dove.

553
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:26,806
It frightened them.

554
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:29,283
He did say that...

555
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:33,283
..."We come in peace."

556
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:44,724
The new computer's ready.

557
00:42:44,893 --> 00:42:46,804
Okay, let's do it.

558
00:42:46,973 --> 00:42:49,441
I know we're making the right decision.

559
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,766
Ready to transmit.

560
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:59,368
This is the president of the United States.

561
00:43:00,253 --> 00:43:02,005
I'm speaking in the hope...

562
00:43:02,173 --> 00:43:05,404
...that what happened earlier today
in the Nevada desert...

563
00:43:05,773 --> 00:43:08,810
...was a cultural misunderstanding.

564
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:12,411
There can be no doubt
that we two peoples...

565
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:15,690
...have a great deal to offer one another.

566
00:43:15,853 --> 00:43:17,764
You must be as excited as we...

567
00:43:17,933 --> 00:43:21,005
...to find intelligent life in the solar system.

568
00:43:22,093 --> 00:43:23,924
Let me make it clear.

569
00:43:24,093 --> 00:43:25,685
You have nothing...

570
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,764
...to fear from us.

571
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:31,210
Our customs may be strange to you...

572
00:43:31,373 --> 00:43:33,933
...but we mean no harm.

573
00:44:42,973 --> 00:44:45,441
When the investors fly in...

574
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,493
...I would like for them each to be...

575
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,206
...met by a limo.

576
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:54,482
Top of the line cars...

577
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:57,283
...leather interiors...

578
00:44:57,853 --> 00:45:00,162
...Corinthian, if they got it.

579
00:45:00,973 --> 00:45:04,249
Are you still spinning your wheels
on that cockamamie hotel?

580
00:45:05,613 --> 00:45:06,807
Hello!

581
00:45:07,453 --> 00:45:09,364
The Martians have attacked!

582
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:13,446
This was no misunderstanding.
I was there. I saw it.

583
00:45:13,613 --> 00:45:15,922
Look, you're worried about yesterday.

584
00:45:16,253 --> 00:45:18,164
I'm worried about tomorrow.

585
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:21,769
The Martians land on Earth,
they'll need a place to stay.

586
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:23,571
Just like everyone else.

587
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,766
My God.

588
00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:29,692
Maybe we should all be destroyed.

589
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:33,690
The human race doesn't deserve to live.

590
00:45:40,413 --> 00:45:41,528
Ethel...

591
00:45:41,693 --> 00:45:43,365
...that reminds me.

592
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,842
I'd like the limos to be stocked...

593
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:48,971
...with every kind of alcohol
known to man.

594
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:51,772
And top it off with a bottle of Dom...

595
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:53,366
...on ice.

596
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,450
What confounds me most of all
is the lack of genitalia.

597
00:45:57,613 --> 00:45:59,444
Down here is the aorta.

598
00:45:59,613 --> 00:46:02,002
Up here we have the sphinx.

599
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:05,370
Notice the highly developed
nerve system here.

600
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:08,889
This explains, of course,
the cerebral arteries.

601
00:46:09,053 --> 00:46:12,568
And if we notice down here,
behind the optic chiasm...

602
00:46:13,293 --> 00:46:15,284
...several glands...

603
00:46:18,893 --> 00:46:20,645
Very curious.

604
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:05,924
"He who believes in me,
though he die, yet shall he live.

605
00:47:06,813 --> 00:47:10,647
"And whoever lives and believes in me
shall never die."

606
00:47:11,773 --> 00:47:14,970
Billy-Glenn Norris gave his life
defending our country.

607
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,964
Why did it have to be him?

608
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:20,967
He's a true American hero.
May God rest his soul.

609
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,325
Ready! Aim.

610
00:47:25,853 --> 00:47:26,808
Fire!

611
00:47:28,173 --> 00:47:29,208
Aim!

612
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:30,568
Fire!

613
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:43,882
Hello?

614
00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:47,284
Byron! Is everything all right?
You still coming tomorrow?

615
00:47:47,373 --> 00:47:50,729
Just try and stop me.
That plane arrives at 4:00 p.m.

616
00:47:50,933 --> 00:47:52,366
Are the kids there?

617
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:53,807
Yeah, hold on.

618
00:47:56,853 --> 00:47:58,445
-Me first.
-No, me.

619
00:48:01,933 --> 00:48:02,683
Hey, Dad.

620
00:48:02,773 --> 00:48:04,684
Who's that? Neville?

621
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,288
How are you?

622
00:48:06,373 --> 00:48:08,204
We're going to the White House.

623
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:09,806
The White House?

624
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:11,167
Yeah, tomorrow.

625
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,244
-Give it back!
-Leave me alone.

626
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:15,563
It's a school thing, like a tour.

627
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:18,531
So you're still going to school
once in a while?

628
00:48:19,973 --> 00:48:21,326
Give me your ma again.

629
00:48:21,413 --> 00:48:22,368
Hold on.

630
00:48:22,453 --> 00:48:23,249
Mom.

631
00:48:23,493 --> 00:48:26,132
-You always get to the phone first.
-So what?

632
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:28,286
I'm first to the game.

633
00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:33,251
Why are you wasting this phone time?
I'll see you tomorrow.

634
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:35,801
But there's something
I want to say to you.

635
00:48:35,973 --> 00:48:38,282
Just 'cause I feel like saying it.

636
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:39,682
What's that?

637
00:48:40,373 --> 00:48:41,726
I love you.

638
00:48:43,493 --> 00:48:45,245
I love you too, Byron.

639
00:48:45,413 --> 00:48:48,371
Now stop wasting money!
I'll see you tomorrow!

640
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:06,606
They're responding.

641
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,724
A message from the Martians.

642
00:49:14,053 --> 00:49:14,929
Really?

643
00:49:15,013 --> 00:49:17,004
They've issued a formal apology.

644
00:49:18,853 --> 00:49:20,844
This is great!

645
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:23,404
I told you this would happen.

646
00:49:23,573 --> 00:49:27,566
The Martian ambassador feels terrible
and wants to speak to Congress.

647
00:49:27,733 --> 00:49:29,246
That's good, isn't it?

648
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:30,846
You bet.

649
00:49:31,413 --> 00:49:33,643
It's a victory for our administration.

650
00:50:45,173 --> 00:50:46,686
Ladies and gentlemen.

651
00:50:46,853 --> 00:50:49,811
This is a proud day for all Americans.

652
00:50:50,373 --> 00:50:53,490
This is a hell of a photo-op, Jerry.

653
00:50:54,053 --> 00:50:56,123
Are you sure I shouldn't be there?

654
00:50:56,293 --> 00:50:59,888
The Secret Service don't want
the executive branch...

655
00:51:00,053 --> 00:51:03,011
...and the legislative branch
in the same room.

656
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:06,931
The Martian ambassador
is going to say a few words.

657
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:09,563
Come on down, Mr. Ambassador!

658
00:52:14,853 --> 00:52:16,491
Mr. Ambassador, please!

659
00:52:22,053 --> 00:52:23,008
Please!

660
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:25,084
This doesn't make sense!

661
00:52:25,253 --> 00:52:27,164
It's not logical! It's not...

662
00:52:29,093 --> 00:52:30,765
Guess it wasn't the dove.

663
00:52:32,613 --> 00:52:33,489
Fire!

664
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:41,004
They blew up Congress!

665
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,204
Why'd they do that?

666
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:07,166
Maybe they don't like the human being.

667
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:25,846
Hello, gentlemen.

668
00:53:26,013 --> 00:53:28,083
Nice of you to come on...

669
00:53:28,253 --> 00:53:30,005
...such short notice.

670
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:32,326
General Decker...

671
00:53:32,493 --> 00:53:34,802
...it seems I owe you an apology.

672
00:53:35,053 --> 00:53:37,613
We all make mistakes, Mr. President.

673
00:53:37,773 --> 00:53:39,604
Not anymore.

674
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:42,970
We're going to take charge of this thing!

675
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:45,488
Excellent. I have prepared the order.

676
00:53:46,173 --> 00:53:47,288
What's this?

677
00:53:47,373 --> 00:53:50,570
Your executive order for full use
of our nuclear deterrent.

678
00:53:54,093 --> 00:53:56,561
Are you crazy? I'm not starting a war!

679
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,646
We're already at war, sir! We have
to nuke them! We must nuke them now!

680
00:54:01,853 --> 00:54:05,129
General Decker, if you do not shut up...

681
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,683
...l'll relieve you of your command.

682
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:09,605
We must strike now, sir!

683
00:54:09,773 --> 00:54:11,684
Annihilate! Kill! Kill!

684
00:54:12,173 --> 00:54:13,128
Shut up!

685
00:54:13,293 --> 00:54:15,443
Shut up! Shut up!

686
00:54:40,093 --> 00:54:41,208
Now...

687
00:54:42,973 --> 00:54:45,362
...I want the people to know...

688
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:48,650
...that they still have two out of three
branches of government...

689
00:54:48,733 --> 00:54:51,293
...working for them, and that ain't bad.

690
00:54:51,453 --> 00:54:56,163
I want the people to know
that the schools will still be open, okay?

691
00:54:56,733 --> 00:54:58,963
And I want the people to know...

692
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:02,091
...that the garbage will still be carried out.

693
00:55:02,253 --> 00:55:03,845
And I want a cop...

694
00:55:04,013 --> 00:55:05,366
...on every corner.

695
00:55:05,453 --> 00:55:07,205
Which, incidentally...

696
00:55:07,373 --> 00:55:09,603
...we would already have...

697
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:12,651
...if they had listened to me
in the last election.

698
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:16,967
Jerry...

699
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:19,203
...how soon can we go on the air?

700
00:55:24,493 --> 00:55:26,882
My fellow Americans.

701
00:55:27,373 --> 00:55:29,443
It is with a heavy heart...

702
00:55:29,613 --> 00:55:31,922
...that I speak to you this afternoon.

703
00:55:32,093 --> 00:55:33,287
As you know...

704
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:38,083
...earlier today the Martian ambassador
and his confederates...

705
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:40,005
...attacked and killed...

706
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:44,166
...many of your representatives
on Capitol Hill.

707
00:55:44,733 --> 00:55:49,204
I will be conferring
with other world leaders as time goes on.

708
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:53,687
And rest assured that, working together...

709
00:55:54,093 --> 00:55:56,653
...we will soon come out...

710
00:55:57,533 --> 00:56:00,331
...at a very real outcome.

711
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:03,846
Thank you.

712
00:56:31,693 --> 00:56:33,365
Nathalie, is that you?

713
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:35,287
Yes.

714
00:56:35,453 --> 00:56:36,568
How're you?

715
00:56:38,533 --> 00:56:40,524
Not terribly good, I'm afraid.

716
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,005
May I ask you a question?

717
00:56:46,733 --> 00:56:48,246
Of course you can.

718
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:51,682
Were you flirting with me on the show?

719
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:53,048
Because...

720
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:54,646
...if you were...

721
00:56:54,733 --> 00:56:56,485
...I just want you to know...

722
00:56:56,573 --> 00:56:58,325
...that I liked it.

723
00:56:59,773 --> 00:57:00,967
You did?

724
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:02,088
Really?

725
00:57:02,173 --> 00:57:05,449
Because, you know,
I've watched you on TV quite a bit and...

726
00:57:05,533 --> 00:57:06,852
...well, I've...

727
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:10,171
...had something of
a schoolboycrush on you for...

728
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,527
...oh, gosh...

729
00:57:11,693 --> 00:57:12,887
...ages.

730
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:53,402
Hi, there.

731
00:57:53,613 --> 00:57:55,922
Are you interested in the White House?

732
00:58:00,893 --> 00:58:03,282
I work there. I'm the press secretary.

733
00:58:03,453 --> 00:58:04,568
Jerry Ross.

734
00:58:05,293 --> 00:58:07,011
Have you ever heard of me?

735
00:58:08,573 --> 00:58:11,087
You wouldn't believe
the pressure of my job.

736
00:58:12,733 --> 00:58:14,803
It's nice to see a new face.

737
00:58:22,253 --> 00:58:23,606
Are you doing anything?

738
00:58:23,693 --> 00:58:25,684
'Cause if you want, I...

739
00:58:25,853 --> 00:58:27,809
...could give you a personalized tour.

740
00:58:27,893 --> 00:58:29,372
Would you like that?

741
00:58:31,653 --> 00:58:34,611
Hey, Mitch, it's me. Can you let me in?

742
00:58:38,293 --> 00:58:40,443
Hello, Mr. Ross. Sure.

743
00:58:40,613 --> 00:58:43,002
We're a little nervous here,
after what happened.

744
00:58:43,093 --> 00:58:44,128
Exactly.

745
00:58:53,093 --> 00:58:55,891
Many great men and women
have passed through here.

746
00:58:56,453 --> 00:58:58,523
Now we're passing through here.

747
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:01,004
Feels good, don't it?

748
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:05,965
You're very graceful.

749
00:59:06,693 --> 00:59:07,887
I like that.

750
00:59:15,253 --> 00:59:16,368
Come here.

751
00:59:36,053 --> 00:59:38,044
We call this the Kennedy Room.

752
00:59:42,213 --> 00:59:43,805
Pretty nifty, huh?

753
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:16,927
So...

754
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:18,606
...how about a drink?

755
01:00:47,493 --> 01:00:49,324
Getting more comfortable.

756
01:00:51,573 --> 01:00:52,926
Outstanding.

757
01:01:06,853 --> 01:01:08,366
How's my lady doing?

758
01:01:18,293 --> 01:01:20,284
Oh, missy, you're hot.

759
01:01:21,013 --> 01:01:23,322
Could we get that gum out of your mouth?

760
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:30,927
My finger!

761
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:38,612
Hello! Hello, operator?
This is an emergency!

762
01:01:38,773 --> 01:01:39,808
Help!

763
01:03:02,133 --> 01:03:03,248
Don't shoot!

764
01:03:07,573 --> 01:03:09,086
Don't worry, darling.

765
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:18,608
Get down!

766
01:03:28,533 --> 01:03:29,886
Thank you, Mitch.

767
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:31,202
It's my job.

768
01:04:23,253 --> 01:04:24,129
What's happening?

769
01:04:24,213 --> 01:04:27,489
They appear to be
in a highly agitated state.

770
01:04:27,653 --> 01:04:29,962
And l, I don't know.

771
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:32,126
I honestly don't know.

772
01:04:32,293 --> 01:04:35,171
I don't know what's going on anymore.
This is frustrating.

773
01:04:35,253 --> 01:04:36,891
I'm not feeling myself.

774
01:04:37,253 --> 01:04:39,244
If only I could hold you in my arms!

775
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,846
Oh, Donald!

776
01:04:41,013 --> 01:04:42,571
I'm scared!

777
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:16,368
Excuse me.

778
01:05:16,533 --> 01:05:19,252
You said you wanted to know
as soon as possible.

779
01:05:19,413 --> 01:05:20,448
What is it?

780
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:21,727
It's NO2.

781
01:05:21,893 --> 01:05:23,565
Highly concentrated.

782
01:05:23,733 --> 01:05:25,007
Nitrogen.

783
01:05:25,493 --> 01:05:26,767
So...

784
01:05:27,013 --> 01:05:29,891
...that's how it could breathe
in our atmosphere.

785
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,445
What's that noise?

786
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:06,170
But, Theodore,
I simply do not feel that Lincoln...

787
01:06:06,573 --> 01:06:08,165
It's a full-scale invasion.

788
01:06:08,253 --> 01:06:09,925
We must get you to safety.

789
01:06:15,613 --> 01:06:16,807
Not this way?

790
01:06:16,893 --> 01:06:19,282
I'm sorry, there's a tour going through.

791
01:06:19,853 --> 01:06:23,687
The Blue Room is often considered
the most beautiful in the White House.

792
01:06:23,853 --> 01:06:26,890
It is often used by the president
to receive guests.

793
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:30,571
It is furnished to represent
the period of James Monroe.

794
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,802
What's that?

795
01:06:32,213 --> 01:06:33,487
That...

796
01:06:33,653 --> 01:06:36,121
...is a portrait of James Monroe.

797
01:07:25,893 --> 01:07:27,326
We lost Taffy!

798
01:07:31,733 --> 01:07:35,169
Keep moving,
we must get you to the back stairs!

799
01:07:41,413 --> 01:07:43,244
The Nancy Reagan chandelier!

800
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:04,331
What are you gawking at?
Get that president out of here!

801
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:12,364
I personally guarantee...

802
01:08:12,773 --> 01:08:16,083
...that you will get a complete return
on your investment...

803
01:08:16,213 --> 01:08:18,124
...within five months.

804
01:08:18,293 --> 01:08:20,124
Mr. Land, excuse me.

805
01:08:20,293 --> 01:08:23,410
Just a second, Sheik Rakula.

806
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:26,049
Now...

807
01:08:26,133 --> 01:08:30,126
...even in a time of so-called
intergalactic emergency...

808
01:08:31,253 --> 01:08:32,527
...the people...

809
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:35,253
...still want to roll them bones!

810
01:08:36,693 --> 01:08:38,126
I believe...

811
01:08:38,613 --> 01:08:40,365
Just five more minutes.

812
01:08:41,253 --> 01:08:44,131
What I'd like for you to do is to...

813
01:08:44,293 --> 01:08:47,490
...view our new,
state-of-the-art show room.

814
01:08:48,773 --> 01:08:51,003
It is out-of-sight!

815
01:08:52,533 --> 01:08:53,602
Gentlemen.

816
01:08:57,493 --> 01:08:59,404
There is no way...

817
01:08:59,573 --> 01:09:01,325
...that we can lose.

818
01:09:44,693 --> 01:09:47,890
"It's not unusual to be loved by anyone

819
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:53,089
"It's not unusual to have fun with anyone

820
01:09:54,533 --> 01:09:57,969
"But when I see you hanging
about with anyone

821
01:09:59,773 --> 01:10:02,333
"It's not unusual to see me cry

822
01:10:04,173 --> 01:10:06,084
"I want to die"

823
01:10:06,893 --> 01:10:08,645
I've called you all day.

824
01:10:08,813 --> 01:10:10,166
The flight's been canceled.

825
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:12,642
Byron, there's Martians everywhere!

826
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:14,443
Hello?

827
01:10:16,013 --> 01:10:17,366
I can't hear you!

828
01:10:22,773 --> 01:10:24,445
I must get to Washington.

829
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:31,051
Do you know anyone who can fly a plane?

830
01:10:31,133 --> 01:10:32,248
Your husband, Art.

831
01:10:32,333 --> 01:10:33,368
He's dead.

832
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:35,012
I told him this would happen.

833
01:10:35,093 --> 01:10:37,163
I loaded the plane with supplies.

834
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:41,605
I want to go to the Tahoe caves.
It's remote, the Martians won't find it.

835
01:10:42,013 --> 01:10:42,968
Where's the plane?

836
01:10:43,053 --> 01:10:45,692
Private airfield. Other side of the freeway.

837
01:10:45,853 --> 01:10:47,525
Will it fly to Washington?

838
01:10:47,693 --> 01:10:49,445
I want to go to Tahoe.

839
01:10:49,613 --> 01:10:51,365
"You find it happens

840
01:10:51,533 --> 01:10:53,603
"All the time

841
01:10:54,173 --> 01:10:56,482
"Love will never do

842
01:10:57,133 --> 01:10:59,044
"What you want it to

843
01:10:59,933 --> 01:11:01,844
"Why can't this crazy love

844
01:11:02,253 --> 01:11:04,164
"Be mine"

845
01:11:12,733 --> 01:11:14,007
Jesus Christ!

846
01:11:22,693 --> 01:11:24,126
Girls, get out!

847
01:11:33,013 --> 01:11:35,322
There's a Martian right behind me!

848
01:11:35,493 --> 01:11:38,053
You're Tom Jones! "It Ain't Unusual."

849
01:11:39,173 --> 01:11:40,208
Autograph?

850
01:11:40,293 --> 01:11:42,329
Anybody got a pen?

851
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,007
Great punch.

852
01:12:01,173 --> 01:12:02,526
You'll need that gun.

853
01:12:02,613 --> 01:12:04,285
-I'm Tom Jones.
-Byron Williams.

854
01:12:04,373 --> 01:12:06,523
I saw you fight in Cardiff, Wales.

855
01:12:07,813 --> 01:12:08,928
You okay?

856
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,483
-I need a drink.
-You and me both.

857
01:12:11,653 --> 01:12:13,564
-We better go.
-Can you fly a plane?

858
01:12:13,653 --> 01:12:14,529
Sure. Got one?

859
01:12:14,613 --> 01:12:15,648
She has.

860
01:12:34,373 --> 01:12:37,012
Don't run, we are your friends.

861
01:13:06,773 --> 01:13:08,286
Martians blew up the shop!

862
01:13:08,373 --> 01:13:09,249
You're kidding.

863
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:10,368
Should I get Grandma?

864
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:13,809
Forget her! She's halfway
to outer space already! Here!

865
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:17,010
I'll tell you one thing.
They ain't getting the TV!

866
01:13:20,533 --> 01:13:23,252
The president of France is on line two.

867
01:13:26,933 --> 01:13:30,050
Mr. President, the president of France
is on line two.

868
01:13:30,213 --> 01:13:31,965
He says it's important.

869
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:39,403
Hello, Maurice.

870
01:13:41,973 --> 01:13:43,565
I have good news.

871
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:45,166
The Martian ambassador is here.

872
01:13:45,253 --> 01:13:47,403
We've negotiated a settlement.

873
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:51,563
Maurice get out of the room.

874
01:13:51,733 --> 01:13:53,166
Get out, now!

875
01:14:36,933 --> 01:14:38,127
Mr. President.

876
01:14:40,453 --> 01:14:42,125
Mr. President.

877
01:14:42,293 --> 01:14:44,761
I need you to sign this!

878
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:50,766
What is it?

879
01:14:50,933 --> 01:14:53,242
My last will and testament?

880
01:14:53,413 --> 01:14:57,247
It is an order to deploy
our nuclear capability, sir.

881
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:07,964
What the hell was that?

882
01:17:46,093 --> 01:17:46,969
Look!

883
01:17:54,093 --> 01:17:55,287
What was that?

884
01:17:57,253 --> 01:17:58,288
Where you going?

885
01:17:58,373 --> 01:17:59,408
To get Grandma.

886
01:17:59,493 --> 01:18:01,370
Stay and defend this trailer!

887
01:18:01,453 --> 01:18:03,489
That's what Billy-Glenn would do.

888
01:18:03,653 --> 01:18:05,166
You're disgracing a hero!

889
01:18:05,253 --> 01:18:07,642
I don't care. I'm gonna go get grandma.

890
01:18:08,293 --> 01:18:09,612
Come back here!

891
01:18:22,373 --> 01:18:24,045
What in the hell is that?

892
01:18:31,213 --> 01:18:32,487
Cut it out!

893
01:18:37,773 --> 01:18:39,092
Stop it!

894
01:18:47,653 --> 01:18:48,722
-This way!
-No, this way!

895
01:18:48,813 --> 01:18:51,168
It's a short cut! The airfield's...

896
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:53,722
Bullshit! The airfield's over there!

897
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:03,087
Being dressed like King Tut
doesn't make you our leader!

898
01:19:03,213 --> 01:19:04,646
Look, this is wrong!

899
01:19:04,813 --> 01:19:08,488
We're lost! He led us down a maze!
I'm going back to the hotel.

900
01:19:08,653 --> 01:19:09,927
-This way!
-Wait!

901
01:19:10,093 --> 01:19:11,845
Where are you going?

902
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:12,729
Come on.

903
01:19:12,813 --> 01:19:14,246
But, I like him.

904
01:19:20,453 --> 01:19:24,605
Assholes! Why'd I listen to them?
I should have stayed in the hotel.

905
01:19:25,173 --> 01:19:26,526
Shit!

906
01:19:29,133 --> 01:19:30,566
I surrender, okay?

907
01:19:31,053 --> 01:19:33,248
You understand what that means?

908
01:19:34,413 --> 01:19:36,973
Look! You're intelligent beings.

909
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:39,689
Let's cut a deal. I can help.

910
01:19:39,853 --> 01:19:41,252
I'm a lawyer!

911
01:19:41,573 --> 01:19:44,849
You want to conquer the world,
you'll need lawyers, right?

912
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:47,368
Here.

913
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:49,771
You want my watch?

914
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:52,813
Take it. Take it. It's a Rolex!

915
01:20:02,893 --> 01:20:04,292
Nice shot!

916
01:20:04,453 --> 01:20:05,806
Pity I was too late.

917
01:20:05,893 --> 01:20:07,690
Can I have the gun back?

918
01:20:07,893 --> 01:20:09,724
Give me the gun and come on!

919
01:21:21,453 --> 01:21:22,408
Grandma!

920
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:31,681
Oh, my God!

921
01:21:45,253 --> 01:21:47,528
I think these guys are very sick.

922
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:50,927
What's happening to them?
What's killing them?

923
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:54,608
I think it must be my music.

924
01:22:02,093 --> 01:22:03,446
Quiet!

925
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:55,441
You think you can do anything you want.

926
01:22:55,613 --> 01:22:56,966
You can't.

927
01:22:57,133 --> 01:22:57,929
Because...

928
01:22:58,013 --> 01:23:00,163
...we are human...

929
01:23:00,493 --> 01:23:01,448
...beings.

930
01:23:01,533 --> 01:23:04,969
And we have the United States Army...

931
01:23:05,933 --> 01:23:07,446
...that'll fight you...

932
01:23:07,533 --> 01:23:11,446
...to the last man!
And we'll never surrender!

933
01:23:15,133 --> 01:23:16,646
Do you hear me?

934
01:23:16,813 --> 01:23:19,611
We'll fight you on the beaches.
We'll fight you in the streets.

935
01:23:19,693 --> 01:23:22,082
We will never, never surrender!

936
01:23:22,253 --> 01:23:24,483
We will win!

937
01:23:24,653 --> 01:23:26,405
Democracy will survive!

938
01:23:26,653 --> 01:23:28,405
We will never, ever...

939
01:23:28,573 --> 01:23:30,086
...surrender!

940
01:23:30,253 --> 01:23:31,527
We will win!

941
01:23:31,693 --> 01:23:33,604
The eagle will be triumphant!

942
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:03,846
Why...

943
01:24:04,093 --> 01:24:05,765
...are you doing this?

944
01:24:07,773 --> 01:24:08,888
Why?

945
01:24:10,013 --> 01:24:12,652
Isn't the universe big enough...

946
01:24:13,213 --> 01:24:14,805
...for both of us?

947
01:24:18,573 --> 01:24:20,564
What is wrong with you people?

948
01:24:23,373 --> 01:24:24,965
We could work together.

949
01:24:26,093 --> 01:24:28,084
Why be enemies?

950
01:24:29,053 --> 01:24:30,725
Because we're different?

951
01:24:31,773 --> 01:24:33,365
Is that why?

952
01:24:37,373 --> 01:24:39,933
Think of the things that we could do.

953
01:24:41,293 --> 01:24:44,091
Think how strong we would be!

954
01:24:45,853 --> 01:24:47,286
Earth...

955
01:24:48,093 --> 01:24:49,924
...and Mars...

956
01:24:50,973 --> 01:24:52,167
...together.

957
01:24:54,693 --> 01:24:57,412
There is nothing
that we could not accomplish.

958
01:24:58,413 --> 01:25:00,085
Think about it!

959
01:25:02,253 --> 01:25:04,084
Think about it!

960
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:07,125
Why destroy...

961
01:25:07,933 --> 01:25:10,003
...when you can create?

962
01:25:11,293 --> 01:25:13,204
We can have it all...

963
01:25:14,013 --> 01:25:16,322
...or we can smash it all!

964
01:25:19,693 --> 01:25:21,126
Why can't we...

965
01:25:21,373 --> 01:25:23,523
...work out our differences?

966
01:25:24,733 --> 01:25:26,564
Why can't we...

967
01:25:26,893 --> 01:25:28,963
...work things out?

968
01:25:31,373 --> 01:25:33,443
Little people...

969
01:25:35,693 --> 01:25:37,684
...why can't we all just...

970
01:25:38,893 --> 01:25:40,565
...get along?

971
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:07,482
What's this?

972
01:26:44,173 --> 01:26:46,641
Don't run. We are your friends.

973
01:26:48,173 --> 01:26:50,641
Don't run. We are your friends.

974
01:27:03,573 --> 01:27:05,325
Next stop, radio station.

975
01:27:08,133 --> 01:27:09,566
There it is!

976
01:27:10,213 --> 01:27:11,726
Let's move it!

977
01:27:28,933 --> 01:27:30,207
There it is.

978
01:27:31,493 --> 01:27:33,484
Go start it. Go with him.

979
01:27:33,653 --> 01:27:35,166
Cindy, come with me.

980
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:53,246
Are you sure you can fly this?

981
01:27:53,333 --> 01:27:54,925
I think so, yeah.

982
01:27:57,253 --> 01:27:58,606
Who put that on?

983
01:27:59,893 --> 01:28:02,532
-It's stuck!
-Cindy, over here.

984
01:28:08,773 --> 01:28:09,888
Shit!

985
01:28:10,773 --> 01:28:13,003
They haven't seen us yet. Come here.

986
01:28:15,013 --> 01:28:16,366
Get in the plane.

987
01:28:16,773 --> 01:28:18,525
I'll distract them.

988
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:20,843
The first chance you get, go.

989
01:28:21,013 --> 01:28:23,083
-I'm not leaving you!
-Just do it!

990
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:25,084
I'll draw them away! Go!

991
01:28:25,253 --> 01:28:26,288
No!

992
01:28:26,453 --> 01:28:27,806
I said go!

993
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:33,886
Oh, my God!

994
01:28:34,693 --> 01:28:35,967
What's he doing?

995
01:28:36,053 --> 01:28:36,929
He's flipped!

996
01:28:37,013 --> 01:28:38,844
He's going to throw them off
so we can escape.

997
01:28:38,933 --> 01:28:40,366
We can't leave him!

998
01:28:43,413 --> 01:28:44,448
No weapon!

999
01:28:44,773 --> 01:28:46,843
No clown outfit!

1000
01:28:47,013 --> 01:28:48,207
Just me!

1001
01:28:48,773 --> 01:28:50,126
Byron Williams...

1002
01:28:50,773 --> 01:28:52,923
...heavyweight champion...

1003
01:28:53,493 --> 01:28:55,085
...of the world!

1004
01:30:02,893 --> 01:30:04,884
Something's happened.

1005
01:30:05,173 --> 01:30:07,164
Something's happened to Byron.

1006
01:30:22,893 --> 01:30:25,361
"When I'm calling you

1007
01:30:46,093 --> 01:30:49,483
"That means I offer my love to you"

1008
01:31:25,373 --> 01:31:26,726
Good-bye, my darling.

1009
01:31:26,813 --> 01:31:28,690
I wish things were different.

1010
01:31:29,453 --> 01:31:31,045
So do I.

1011
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:37,687
Good-bye.

1012
01:31:38,093 --> 01:31:39,128
I love you.

1013
01:31:39,213 --> 01:31:41,044
I love you too, Nathalie.

1014
01:33:12,893 --> 01:33:14,406
Florence Norris...

1015
01:33:14,573 --> 01:33:17,610
...I present to you
the Congressional Medal of Honor...

1016
01:33:17,773 --> 01:33:19,923
...the nation's highest decoration.

1017
01:33:21,773 --> 01:33:25,209
Thank you,
but don't you dare let this happen again!

1018
01:33:26,653 --> 01:33:28,325
Richard Norris...

1019
01:33:28,493 --> 01:33:31,371
...on behalf of my parents,
who couldn't be here today...

1020
01:33:31,453 --> 01:33:33,842
...for saving the world from the Martians...

1021
01:33:33,933 --> 01:33:36,322
...I present to you the Medal of Honor.

1022
01:33:37,133 --> 01:33:39,124
Don't kiss me if you don't want.

1023
01:33:39,533 --> 01:33:40,966
I have to.

1024
01:33:44,013 --> 01:33:46,243
I prepared a speech. Is that okay?

1025
01:33:46,973 --> 01:33:48,964
Sure, that's very appropriate.

1026
01:33:53,613 --> 01:33:54,807
Hi, everybody.

1027
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:57,367
I want to say...

1028
01:33:57,453 --> 01:33:59,921
Can you speak up? We can't hear you.

1029
01:34:00,413 --> 01:34:03,610
I want to say that there's
a lot of people in the world...

1030
01:34:03,693 --> 01:34:06,491
...that have done a lot more
than I have, and...

1031
01:34:06,653 --> 01:34:08,723
...they should be here now...

1032
01:34:08,973 --> 01:34:10,406
...getting a medal.

1033
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:14,403
And I want to thank my grandma...

1034
01:34:14,573 --> 01:34:16,643
...for always being good to me...

1035
01:34:16,813 --> 01:34:19,611
...and for helping save the world
and everything.

1036
01:34:20,733 --> 01:34:23,850
So, I guess, like, now we just have to...

1037
01:34:24,013 --> 01:34:27,847
...start over and start rebuilding
everything, like our houses.

1038
01:34:28,013 --> 01:34:32,723
But I was thinking, maybe instead
of houses we could live in tepees.

1039
01:34:33,053 --> 01:34:35,123
Because it's better in many ways.

1040
01:34:38,573 --> 01:34:41,133
That's all I have to say. Thanks.

1041
01:34:42,973 --> 01:34:44,167
Was that okay?

1042
01:34:44,253 --> 01:34:45,288
Yeah.

1043
01:34:46,093 --> 01:34:47,731
Do you got a girlfriend?

1044
01:34:47,933 --> 01:34:48,888
No.

1045
01:34:50,253 --> 01:34:53,211
Give me a break.
Go on in there and clean your room.

1046
01:34:53,373 --> 01:34:55,933
I can't do this all by myself. Look at you.

1047
01:36:11,813 --> 01:36:13,804
