I need you here.

No! You don't need me.

w-we'll call.

332

And I think it would be
a good idea

333
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,609
if we all sat down very soon
and discussed your future.

Yeah, <i>my</i> future.

We're still focused on
Bazevich as our killer.

We finally got his records
from D.O.D.

341
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,995
Well, are we any closer
to finding this guy?

342

Cops have been by all his
usual hangouts--no sign of him.

343

Harken's checking a lead,

344
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,600
but look, if you ask me,
these Alpha fights

345
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:49,768
are still our best bet.

346
00:15:49,835 --> 00:15:51,436
Just as long
as it's a stakeout

347
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:53,404
and no more fighting.

348
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:55,840
I wasn't the one fighting.

349
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:57,674
[Chuckles]
To be honest with you,

350
00:15:57,742 --> 00:15:59,176
I don't know
if we can keep him away.

351
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:00,711
I mean, the guy's
in training right now

352
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:03,713
for his next fight.

353
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:06,616
The human nervous system
of the body

354
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:09,719
sending and receives
while also processing

355
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:12,856
neurological impulses
throughout our brain.

356
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:16,626
It controls all physical
and fine motor skills

357
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:19,328
while also impacting
our thoughts,

358
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:23,166
emotions,
and cognitive function.

359
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:27,403
The spinal cord serves as
a telegraphic cable,

360
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:31,041
sending various messages
throughout the body.

361
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:33,043
The spine itself measures
approximately

362
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,378
a quarter of an inch
in diameter,

363
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:38,248
and varies in length
from person to person.

364
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:40,650
The synaptic impulses...
[Knock at door]

[Turns off TV]

So watch out for that guy,

367
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:46,189
'cause he'll mess
with your eyes.

368
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:47,890
And then there's this
other guy, super flexible.

369
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,392
You punch him,
pops right back,

370
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,294
so you gotta drive him
into a corner.

371
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:53,863
That way, he springs back
and forth against your fists.

372
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,867
What about, um,
that guy that spits acid?

373
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,002
Bazevich?

374
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,771
He's badass, scary as hell.

375
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:03,205
Okay, pay attention.

376
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:12,549
So you kickbox too?

377
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,384
No, never have.

378
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:16,019
Yeah, but you just can't
pick that up right away.

379
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:18,622
I'm a quick study.

380
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,092
Ahh.
You're an Alpha.

381
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:22,660
So are we done chatting?

382
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:24,562
We got a lot of work to do.

383
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:28,266
Hi.

384
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,434
Um...

385
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:32,970
so I raided the soap aisle.

386
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,110
I figured
while we're on stakeout,

387
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:42,413
you should get to at least
choose how I smell...

388
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:44,615
which really sounded
a whole lot better in my head.

389
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:46,650
So you actually went
and bought all of these things?

390
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:48,719
Yeah, I mean,
I thought about unscented,

391
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:50,955
but I figure nothing's
really unscented to you.

392
00:17:51,023 --> 00:17:52,223
You're right!

393
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,427
There is no such thing
as unscented to me.

394
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:57,996
Tom's of Maine
is probably the mildest.

395
00:17:58,064 --> 00:17:59,764

00:17:59,832 --> 00:18:01,933
And thank you.

You're welcome.

398
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:16,515
Is that it?

399
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,218
I'm not gonna amp up
just for practice.

400
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:20,686
It's not healthy for me.

is using your ability

As much as I would like
to see that, no.

nah, nah, nah.

644
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,043
Surprise.

645
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:49,526
You trying to play me, Kat?

646
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,061
I never said
I wasn't a fighter.

647
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:53,402
There is gonna be
some action tonight!

648
00:30:53,502 --> 00:30:54,836
Place your bets!
Right now!

649
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:56,504
Kat, this isn't
a good idea.

650
00:30:56,571 --> 00:31:00,107
Harken,
this isn't personal.

651
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:01,475
All right, all right.
What you waiting for?

652
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,115
In battle, a warrior
who remains calm

653
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:11,117
and remembers their training

654
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:15,054
will always vanquish a foe
who does not.

655
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,628
Shift your opponent's weight
to one leg

656
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:23,663
and attack
the weighted knee.

657
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:30,070
If you lack size,

658
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,640
compensate with speed
and precision.

659
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,484
The brain
is the most sensitive organ

660
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,720
in the human body.

661
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:53,062
[Crowd shouting, cheering]

662
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,997
Aah!

663
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,770
[Cheering]

664
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:05,376
Hey.
Hey, you all right?

665
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:06,677
Is he okay?

666
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:08,545
He's awesome.
Yeah, thanks.

667
00:32:08,613 --> 00:32:09,847
Hey, Harken.

668
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:11,248
Harken.

669
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:12,249
Come on.

670
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:13,584
Not bad.

671
00:32:13,652 --> 00:32:17,787
Some people want to talk
to you about a job.

672
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:20,256
- What kind of a job?
- Well, I don't know.

673
00:32:20,324 --> 00:32:23,126
They didn't say,
but I know they pay big.

674
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:26,862
Hear 'em out.
Let 'em buy you a drink.

675
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:30,099
Okay.

676
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,634
You all right?

677
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:39,074
Oh, that's that girl Kat
from the other night.

678
00:32:43,413 --> 00:32:45,481
Bill! Hicks!
Come on!

679
00:32:49,753 --> 00:32:50,720
What happened?

680
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:52,054
You okay?

681
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:53,322
- [Sighs]
- Ask him who did it.

682
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,991
[Groans]
Hicks, I will kill you.

683
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:57,027
Hey, listen,
we got a lead on Bazevich.

684
00:32:57,094 --> 00:32:58,495
He was in that car.
[Engine turns over]

685
00:32:58,562 --> 00:32:59,829
Oh, and your friend Kat
just got in there.

686
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:01,297
All right, let's go.
Come on.

687
00:33:01,365 --> 00:33:03,299
[Tires squeal]

688
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:12,141
That's their S.U.V.

689
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:14,644
What the hell is this place?

690
00:33:14,712 --> 00:33:17,448
Okay, Bazevich is inside.

691
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:19,716
You can smell him?

692
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:21,385
Believe me,
he's unforgettable.

693
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:22,854
Rachel,
what's going on in there?

694
00:33:22,921 --> 00:33:26,091
There's, uh...
[Heartbeats in distance]

695
00:33:26,158 --> 00:33:27,692
There's multiple heartbeats.

696
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,031
An EKG, respirators,
hospital machines?

697
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:35,868
The place is wired
with sensor alarms.

698
00:33:35,935 --> 00:33:38,370
I hear weaponry...
[Guns clack]

699
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:41,406
And heavy boots.

700
00:33:41,474 --> 00:33:43,508
Unit One to tactical,
send backup to our position.

701
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:45,510
Wait.
It's that girl Kat.

702
00:33:45,578 --> 00:33:50,215
No! Let me go!

703
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:52,918
Her voice is weak.
She's fading.

704
00:33:52,985 --> 00:33:56,555
A male voice now.
"Make sure she stays under."

705
00:33:56,623 --> 00:33:59,124
They want to prep her
right away.

706
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:00,592
Prep her for what?

707
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,062
- I can't wait.
- Harken, wait!

708
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:05,998
Damn it!

709

Yeah, you beat me.

We'll need three ambulances

00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:54,704
and transport for prisoners
to Binghamton.

736

- So that's Bazevich.
- Hmm.

00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:02,446
The guy we've been chasing
the last two days

00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:04,414
is a dead man.

Hey, turns out Bazevich
was a prisoner here too.

741
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:15,359
Poetic justice
for killing Duffy, I guess.

Experimenting on Alphas.

00:36:18,363 --> 00:36:20,164
More like treating us
like animals.

00:36:20,232 --> 00:36:22,400
I could have gotten
out of there myself, you know.

You know what?

747
00:36:23,903 --> 00:36:25,570
You can just say,

for rescuing me."

You're going to have to take it
easy for a while.

You've been through quite
an ordeal.

at you, too, later.

No, no.
I'm--I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:50,328
Look, I got to use my ability
and feel no downside, so...

759
00:36:50,396 --> 00:36:52,931
- No downside?
- No downside at all.

760
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:55,734
Hey, Dr. Rosen,
who are you guys anyway?

761
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:58,537
So Harken was undercover, right?
I wasn't undercover.

762
00:36:58,604 --> 00:36:59,872
You were
definitely undercover.

763
00:36:59,939 --> 00:37:02,508
And then he--he barged in
with those guys.

764
00:37:02,576 --> 00:37:03,776
We're consultants.

765
00:37:03,844 --> 00:37:05,144
We work with the government
now and then

766
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:07,080
in situations
not unlike this one.

767

You're Alpha Secret Agents,
right?

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,350
- You're gonna be fine.
- You're Alpha secret agents.

00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:11,651
Just take it easy.

- I to--I'm totally right.
- No, no.

771
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:16,890
I'm right, right?

772
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:18,892
You want me on your team.
I'm awesome.

773
00:37:31,738 --> 00:37:33,205
It's the perfect soap.

774
00:37:33,273 --> 00:37:35,540
It'll blend really well
with your natural scent,

775
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:37,042
which, by the way, is--

776
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:40,612
is really good
on its own anyway, so...

777
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,813
there.

778
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:45,217
Thanks.
Um, I'll try it.

779
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:48,219
I was--I was,
uh, in the village,

780
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:50,922
and I found it at this shop
next to my favorite restaurant,

781
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,324
which is Italian.

782
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:55,759
Oh.

783
00:38:04,602 --> 00:38:06,469
Do you like Italian?

784
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:11,207
Um...

785
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:14,310
Rachel, if--if we're going
to be working together--

786
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:15,711
Right.

787
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:19,415
Forget I mentioned it.

788
00:38:40,572 --> 00:38:42,573
What can I get you?

789
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:45,176
Earl Grey tea, please.

790
00:38:45,244 --> 00:38:49,014
Okay.

791
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:50,215
Hello, Lee.

792
00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:52,851
May I join you?

793
00:38:54,861 --> 00:38:57,529
You made it
very easy for me, Stanton.

794
00:38:57,995 --> 00:39:00,530
Or do you prefer Major Dunham?

795
00:39:00,598 --> 00:39:03,066
I prefer Stanton.

796
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:06,203
Well, thank you for providing
Dr. Harrison's research.

797
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,739
So you'd know how I began.

798
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:11,241
Yes.
By murdering a friend.

799
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:17,648
Dr. Harrison
wanted to use me.

800
00:39:17,716 --> 00:39:21,318
So you scarified
an innocent man.

801
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:24,321
Have you ever sacrificed
an innocent man?

802
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:26,022
Not intentionally.

803
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,126
Every man must control
his own destiny.

804
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:34,564
I reenlisted
after the doctor's death.

805
00:39:34,632 --> 00:39:36,766
I helped saved the Union.

806
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,368
Hmm.

807
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:39,636
So you're what--

808
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:42,506
looking for the thanks
of a grateful nation?

809
00:39:42,574 --> 00:39:44,341
No.

810
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:49,013
Just some understanding
of my unique perspective.

811
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:52,050
I was shot again
at Cold Harbor

812
00:39:52,118 --> 00:39:54,186
and again at San Juan Hill,

813
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:57,389
fought at Verdun,
in the streets of Berlin.

814
00:39:57,457 --> 00:39:59,024
Oh, a very impressive resume.

815
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,993
Thank you.

816
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:07,466
Every change brings bloodshed.

817
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:10,403
We can stop that.

818
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,705
And yet you say
a war is coming.

819
00:40:12,773 --> 00:40:15,175
Hmm.

820
00:40:15,243 --> 00:40:17,444
Because...

821
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:20,847
[Liquid pouring]

822
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:24,984
ordinary men react
with fear and violence

823
00:40:25,052 --> 00:40:27,186
to anything
that's new and different.

824
00:40:30,823 --> 00:40:32,357
You know,
one of my favorite subjects

825
00:40:32,425 --> 00:40:34,925
in medical school
was cellular research...

826
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:36,260
Mmhmm.

827
00:40:36,328 --> 00:40:39,163
Examining the constituent
parts of things,

828
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,533
trying to figure out
how it all...

829
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:44,568
works together.

830
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:46,804
It was very tedious,
but, um...

831
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:50,975
It was exciting,
because eventually...

832
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:54,145
I could see the whole picture.

833
00:40:57,683 --> 00:41:00,552
Try the tuna melt next time.

834
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,054
It's excellent.

835
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,540
No, Mom.
Don't do that.

836
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:23,376
That's how I like it.

837
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:25,311
Yeah, but that's the way
you keep it at home.

838
00:41:25,378 --> 00:41:28,047
No, this is home.
It's how I like it here.

839
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:31,417
Right.

840
00:41:36,023 --> 00:41:37,223
Good night, Gary.

841
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:41,862
Yeah, good night.

842
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:45,265
Uh, Mom.

843
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,467
Where'd you go?

844
00:41:46,534 --> 00:41:49,036
I'm right here.

845
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:55,143
I'll call you at 8:00
after I scream,

846
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,945
but before
I've had my breakfast.

847
00:41:59,115 --> 00:42:00,582
I'll answer.

848
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,286
Yeah, okay.

849
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:13,928

851
00:42:22,203 --> 00:42:24,104
Well, look who's back.

852
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:25,973
Here to watch?

853
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:29,143
Hell, no.
I'm here to fight.
