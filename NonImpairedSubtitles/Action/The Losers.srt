176
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,050
Could this get any worse??

177
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,450

I found a guy online.Says he can get intel on Max for cash,

182
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,290
All we need is to make a little money.

183
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,390
We Do not have money.

184
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,690
Want to go paypal on some kids in a basement that problably lying?

You were there.You know what we did.

186
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,300
Man tried to kill us.

187
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,300
Man killed us,Clay.

188
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,200
No,We got to stay focus.

189
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,900

hell,we didnt event see what the guy looks like

194
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,280
But I heard his voice.

195
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,810
A man with a voice is a man with a throat.

196
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,420
-The guy has a throat ...- Come ...

197

Clay,look around you.

198

Do you really think we are in position to take on CIA super spook?

199
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,520
- Rogue ...- No,its a hell of a plan.

200
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,890
Know what Pooch can setup there next to the taco stand,

201
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,630
and Jensen can serve communications right there next to hookers.

202
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,430

All right?

206
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,740

214
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,250

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,660
Do u have a bathroom?

223
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,100
No,I specifically asked only the hotel room in the world that has no bathroom.

224
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,910
Are u trying  to turn a  "Yes" into a "No"?

225
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,110
Oh.Thank you.

226

252

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,960
Pepito's birthday.

272
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,300
Besides a pants bustin crush ...

273
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,900
The company file is blank.

274
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,600
CIA has a standing kill order on her.

275
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,910
Hamas,Sien Feim ...pretty much all except PETA wants this chick antsgrave.

276
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,210
Hey,think you're thinking clear on this?

277
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,910
Hein?Because every time you messed up it was because of a women.

278

- Name one time that i..- Amber.

279
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,520
Amber was not the problem Her husband was the problem.

280
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,520
Amber's husband was not the one who shot you.

281
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,020
- it was only in the leg .- What about Emma?

282
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,870
Emma doesnt count,I didnd sleep with Emma.

283
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,630

284
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,130

285
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,830

289
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,440
You better be,because I aint gettin killed by no girl.

290
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,150
Long time since anyone called me a Girl.

291
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,450
She put a bomb in your car?

292
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,850
She was volatile..

293
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,660
Aisha,they are Jensen Pooch,Rogue and Cougar.

294
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,760
Really?

295
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,170
Gentlemen,in 97 hours,Max will be in Miami.

296
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,640
He Travels in an armored column,

297
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,370
that at least 30 guards armed to the teeth.

298
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,480
You have a better chance at kidnapping the president.

299
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,080
The good news for you is ...

300
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,480
I have the power bring you back to the U.S.

301
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,090
And fund the entire Ops,as you see fit

302
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,290
You get Max it and we're square.

303
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,490
And ...Why should we belive u ?

304
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,900
Because I'm the first person you've met that even admits he exist.

305
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,600
Listen,you guys can all stay here in Bolivia n rott.

306
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,310
Or go home and get revenge on the man that framed you.

307
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,710
It is your choice.

308
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,010
Colonel?

309
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,710
Dont call me that.We are not soldiers anymore.

310
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,420
All right.You know that if we do this,

311
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,020
we are waging a war against C.I.A.

312
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,420
They had started it!.

313
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,420

319

332
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,190
To hit the face nod,not to throw him off the roof nod.

333
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,860
I thought thats what you wanted?!?!?!.

334
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,900
At most,at most that was a brake his finger nod.

335
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,200
Jesus! Wade..

336
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,200
The man was a scientific genius.

337
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,610
granted his weight signals certains impulse controls issues

338
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,410
But thats no reason to throw his fat ass off 57 floors .

339
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,910
sorry...

340
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,710
Well ...

341
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,220
I think I speak for everyone here

342
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,420
May say your actions were excessive.

343
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,920
And yes,more than just a little wasteful.

344
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,830
But then it does seem to have the desired effects.

345
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,430
ill tell you what.Throw baldy up next .

346
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,740
No,please.Wait.

347
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,740
We have a different moral perspective that of our late colleague.

348
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,640
I need one to test it and four to use.

349
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,840
Four snoops?

350
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,050
We will need much money.

351
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,850
you will have ''Much money''.

352
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,900


353
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Welcome back to the land of the living.

354
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
How do you want to begin?

355
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,610
We're gonna go bird huntin,

356
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,660
Its a Sonic Dematerialized.

357
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,260
Better known as "Snoop."

358
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,970
21st Century green terrorist.

359
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,170
Pure destruction,no pollution.

360
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,980
So,who we sellin'em to?

361
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,650
Chinese extremists,the PLF,French,Basque,I do not care.

362
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,990
As long as they have the right  price,and willing to use it.

363
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,890
No stock pilling ,No detourence.

364
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,090
It's like giving a hand gun to a six years old,Wade.

365
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:04,400
You do not know how its gonna end,but pretty sure it will make the papers.

366
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,100
Another war.

367
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,200
Well,what do you belive in,Wade?

368
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,400
I guess Shotguns and Big Tittiz?.

369
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,810
I also enjoy air shows and beer.

370
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,520
We are saving the country Wade.Doing something for benefit of U.S.

371
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,720
I was born in Quebec.

372
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,820
OK.Then save we are saving North America.

373

We've bein in a colision with civilian vehicle.

377

410
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,700
Have you ever seen an EMT look like this ?

411
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,400
Really bro? "Hi.whats your name "

Yo,J...

What do you think is up with "Not me call me Colonel stuff"?

415
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,510
Classic loss of identity.

416
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,420
Clay defined himself by his place in the military structure.

417
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,720
his way of measuring the good he did the world.

418
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,020
Without it,hes just a Losers,like the rest of us.

You knew that a cats can make thousands of different sounds,and dogs only ten?

420
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,230

00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,410

440
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,220

443
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,440
Do you have any hobbies?

444
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,040
When I was little

445
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,440
I collected human ears.

446
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,450
Good times  ...

447
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,350
But is...

448
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,860
No,no,no.k listen ...

449
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,570
If you want a gas turbine generator find a force fed electrified unit

450
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,070
hooked it to the fuel tank.

451
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,370
Are few things in life which can not be solved by duct tape.

452
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,480
Are small arms gonna be a problem?

453
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,880
Its takin care of,thanks.

454
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,180
Which brings me to my question.

455
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,390
Aisha?

456
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,190
What do you want with Max?

457
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,150
Rogue ...

458
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,890

460
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,500
You can but we made a deal.

461
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,800
Fuck deals okay?

462
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,900
You made a deal with Clay.

463
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,200
I want answers.

464
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,010
Max is trying to buy next generation weapons.

465
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,510
I dont know the end game.

466
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,020
But what I do know is when Max seeks an into interested something him,

467
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,080
people die.

468
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,720
And world map get redrawn.

469
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,620
Shit.

470
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,320
And you really think u can get'm little girl?

471

476
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,440
If you want me to shoot your bankroll,Rogue,go ahead

477
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,440
Rogue.Rogue ...

All right,stay with us.

479
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,220
But if I smell something traps

480
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,260
Do you gonna put a bullet in the head.Sounds fair?

481
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,660
Sounds fun.

482
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,060
Sounds like my parents.

483
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,560
I knew your not gonna shoot her.

484
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,770

490
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:56,190
Are you trying to say that your embarrassed to be seen in an American classic!?

491
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,100

Good shot.

495
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,110
Hey,where are the seatbelts,bro?

496
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,920
We dont need seatbelts.

497
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,420

Max.

559
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,360
Who the hell is Max?

Jensen open it.

562
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080

From Goliath the Multinational manufacturer of everything

564

Without a decryption key that goes with this

566
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,890
your looking at a very cool paper weight.

567
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,900
Shoot her.

568
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,100

569
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,210
- Dont you wanna find out whats on it? - No!

570
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,610
I cant find Max.

Clay!

574
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,220
Whatever it is,we can use it against him!

575
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,020
It's leverage!

576

They know we are alive,Rogue.

602
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,300
The only thing got against this guy is that drive.

00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,870
She framed us.

604

What do you know about deep space?

620
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:58,870
Nothing.

621
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,770
- Base particle string theory? - Nothing.

622
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,070
singularity events?

623
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:05,880
Not a thing.

624
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,180
I think we should move on then.

625
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,290
I'm gonna give you 45 seconds to explain what happened with my drive.

Clay and his unit?

629
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,010
Sounds like a porno,Wade.

630
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,310
You had them killed 4 months ago.

631
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,510
Ive done alot in 4 four months ,Wade.

632
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,120
I am a very busy man.

633
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,820
The Bolivia situation?

634
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,280
Fad-hil?

635
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,090

Was incinerated,along with everyting else in the blast.

637
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,220
These guys survived.

638

Did you happen to find out who was behind them?

642
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,840
Not C.I.A.,N.S.A,Special Ops ...

643
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,140
Yes,I am aware thats not us.

644
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,240
seems that the only thing we do know,

645
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,840
is who there coming after.

646

The plan is ''get me 18 man fire team in 12 hours.

00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,460
Are we clear on the plan?

652
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,770
Or we could do it a third time?

653
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,070
- clear.- Okay.

654
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,800
Oh! Wade,you know what I was thinking?

655
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:36,840

00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:48,750
Pooch has a wife.

661
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,650
Jensen has a niece.

662
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,060
When all this over an they return to their families

663
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,260
What are you going to do ?

664
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,460

666
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,570

He would kill you.

672
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,000
Why is that?

673
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,200
Because of the others.

674
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,710
you care what happens to them.

675
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:45,910
And you think this is a weakness?

676
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:47,610
I know it is.

677
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:50,410
It is law of the jungle ...

678
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,720
But we are not in the jungle.

728
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,400
Freeze!!

729
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,100
Wow! this has gotten serious.

730
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,610
I'm warning you!

731
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,720
I am a lethal killing machine.

732
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,520
It was a secret government experiment

733
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,920
They did stuff to me ...

734
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,630
Spooky stuff...

735
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,330
Anal stuff...

736
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,330
Turned me in a dangerous telekinetic.

737
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,640
As the ancient Tibetan philosophy states,

738
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,640
"Dont start none''

739
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,740
wont be none."

740
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,250
"telekinetik" your way on these.

741
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,270
Face Down..

742
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,770
Or I'll make your heart stop beating with my mind.

743
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,580
Thanks,Cougar.

744

All right,say it again but much slower and dumber,please.

751
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,920

754
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,030
So you load the cash On this badboy

755
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,030
and you can physically move anywhere you want to go.

756
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,630
We have Max's courrier drive ,right?

757
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:28,030
We have Max's $ 400 million dollars.

758
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,740
R'right Clay,before you do something noble,Like smashing it,

759
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:34,140
I say we go on Amazon.com And get a jet.

760
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,740
Ahhh it doesnt work that way.

761
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,450
Unfortunately,courrier-drive can be Loaded and unloaded

762
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,450
On there home system.

763
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,350
Although,if we were gonna buy stuff,

764
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,350
I say a canary yellow streatch Hummer.

765
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,820
No,no.We're gonna trade it back to him .

766
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,960
Hes gonna get his money and we will clear our name.

767
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,560
- No,We did a deal.- Yes.

768
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,460
Aisha ...

769
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,860
Hes gonna kill us now,you know that,

770
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,430
Yes,I know that.

771
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,870
This thing has a record all IPs from where it was accessed.

772
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,470
And one address comes up alot.

773
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,180
its obviously a place where this thing keep going back too.

774
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,380
Max's Base of Operations .

775
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,580
Port of Los Angeles.

776
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,990
there probably files of every Black book ops which he ever did .

777
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,190
Including Bolivia.

778
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:21,890
We could hit it there and clean it out.

779
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,790
Expose the world the what hes done.

780
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,900
And clear ourname in the prossess.

781
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,800
A'right,it's a good plan.

782
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,500
But we still kill him.

783
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,410
Absolutely.

784
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,810


785
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,610
We appreciate you meeting us at a single storie facility

786
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,420
No problem.

787
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,220
I regard the whole incident

788
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,420
as a way of us knows each others bisiness orientation.

789
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,020
I agree.

790
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,820
But now that we do know each other,

791
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:58,430
Know that if you ever get near me with that Yankee-cockeye Bullshit

792
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,230
You will be fed to my dogs.

793
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,640
As you know,we've have a hiccup on our end with the money

794
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,040
One billion dollars.This is the new price.

795
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,240
- A billion? - Cash.

796
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,540
Cash will be difficult.

797
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,850
Difficult? Mr.Wade...

798
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:17,650
Life the way you people want to live it is difficult.

799
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,350
you want less difficult,

800
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,760
move in my country,study Hinduism.

801
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,060
Meditate

802
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,460
Cultivate your serenity.

803
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,060
way less difficult.

804
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,060
But you,you want to buy bombs.

805
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,970
I afraid that this is a more difficult way of life.

806
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:35,670
Mr.Wade ...

807
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200

830
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,990

- Congratulations,man.- Congratulations,thank you ...

861

You say that now,but you know Jolene.

01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,630
When she know I'm alive,she's gonna kill me.

863
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:17,630
I cant let her have that baby without me.

864
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,840
What? What?

865
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,540
Ofcourse we all know we're gonna die in there.

866
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,950
Or can do this without you.

867
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,850
No,you cant.

868
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,250
Go home.

869
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,460
Got it!

870
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,460
Fadhil's 4 million didnt disappeared,

871
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,960
but entered into a private account.

872
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,460
Whose account?

873
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,270
It's a family trust...

874
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:48,670

Painting terrorist camp

880
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:07,290
So we could bomb it.

881
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:11,590
It turns out that we were executing Max's redetta.

882
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:14,100
So you knew nothing about Fadhil?

883
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,800
A Target a target.

884
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,200
It would have been no difference if I have wouldnt've seen those kids.

885
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,210
- You went in? - Yeah.

Yes.

890
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,730
Why do you want to know all this?

891
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:43,230
Did you kill Fadhil,Clay?

892
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:47,730
Who are you?

893
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,240
Fadhil's daughter,Clay! Fadhil's daughter!

894
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,640

898
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,850
I know it makes no sense,but yes!

899
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,850
It's better now?

900
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:10,060
Not really.

901
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,660
Where's your gun,Jensen?

902
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:12,520

01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:02,010
Cougar,be gentle!

910
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,320

01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:35,350

01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:37,450
Always with the money.

917
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:39,750
"Hi.How are you?"

918
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:41,150
''How have you been ?"

919
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:45,660

923
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,270
In fact,I'm thinking of putting a satellite radio in the car.

924
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,270
