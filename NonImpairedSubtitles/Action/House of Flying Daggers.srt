1
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:25,831
CHINA 859 A.D.

2
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:27,376
After 241 years of prosperity,

3
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:29,587
the Tang Dynasty is in decline.

4
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:31,914
The Emperor is weak and incompetent.

5
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,749
His government, crippled by corruption,

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,551
no longer controls the land.

7
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:37,319
Unrest sweeps the country.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,660
Village by village,

9
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:40,422
an underground alliance forms...

10
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:42,091
'The House of Flying Daggers'.

11
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:43,692
Based in Feng Tian County,
near the Imperial Capital,

12
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:45,528
The House Of Flying Daggers
moves in the shadows,

13
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,096
Stealing From the rich
to give to the poor,

14
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:48,597
they earn the support and
admiration of the people.

15
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:50,099
At the same time, they
are feared and hated

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,500
by their bitter rivals...

17
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:53,765
the local deputies,

18
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,197
Captain Leo, Captain Jin.

19
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:08,613
We're heading out on patrol.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,900
We're going to be busy again.

21
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:21,764
The Provincial Office
has given us ten days

22
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:23,833
to catch the new leader
of the 'Flying Daggers'.

23
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:24,926
What?

24
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,029
It took us three months to assassinate

25
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:30,626
their old leader.

26
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,673
Ten days? Impossible.

27
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,604
Have you heard of the
new Peony Pavilion?

28
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:39,847
Yes.

29
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,945
Does anyone know you there?

30
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:46,183
No, I haven't been there yet.

31
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:48,964
Good, now's your chance.

32
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,436
Any information?

33
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:55,453
We suspect one of the showgirls

34
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,492
is a member of the 'Flying Daggers'.

35
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:00,332
OK, I'll check it out.

36
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:11,579
Pull. Pull harder.

37
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,014
Pull harder.

38
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,265
That's it. I'm done.

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,834
Madam!

40
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:39,034
I'm coming.

41
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:39,641
Madam.

42
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:40,969
Here I am.

43
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:46,134
What can I do for you, sir?

44
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,163
I heard you have a new girl.

45
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:51,950
You're well informed.

46
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,153
Is she pretty?

47
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,220
She's quite a beauty.

48
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,471
Bring her to me.

49
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:20,681
There is one thing you need to know.

50
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:21,951
What's that?

51
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,216
The girl is blind.

52
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,518
Blind?

53
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,059
Then she must be special.

54
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:33,328
I'm curious.

55
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:18,131
How did you lose your sight?

56
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,008
I was born blind.

57
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:24,342
Why would a blind girl work here?

58
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,445
Why can't a blind girl work here?

59
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:29,945
You're right.

60
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:32,724
What's your name?

61
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:34,114
Mei.

62
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,158
Mei?

63
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:41,178
Every girl here is named after a flower.

64
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,592
Why is yours so plain?

65
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:47,903
I don't want to compete
with those girls.

66
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,434
What do you mean?

67
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:54,244
The flowers here can
hardly be called flowers.

68
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:57,014
Real flowers bloom in the wilderness.

69
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,015
Well said.

70
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:07,223
If you impress me

71
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:10,734
I'll take you to where
the real flowers grow.

72
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,897
What's your talent as the top showgirl?

73
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,057
Dancing.

74
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:19,962
Come closer.

75
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:10,668
Don't you know the rules?

76
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:19,651
A rare beauty in the North.

77
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:24,617
She's the finest lady on earth.

78
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:30,458
A glance from her, the
whole city goes down.

79
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:35,795
A second glance leaves
the nation in ruins.

80
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,640
There exists no city or nation

81
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:43,744
that has been more cherished

82
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:49,016
than a beauty like this.

83
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:21,349
A rare beauty in the North.

84
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:26,187
She's the finest lady on earth.

85
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:32,120
A glance from her, the
whole city goes down.

86
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:37,331
A second glance leaves
the nation in ruins.

87
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,201
There exists no city or nation

88
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,464
that has been more cherished

89
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:53,781
than a beauty like this.

90
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,823
Please calm down, sir.

91
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,160
Go away.

92
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,763
What's the matter?

93
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,634
Please let me explain.

94
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:14,503
This girl is young and inexperienced.

95
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:16,028
Please forgive her.

96
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,399
Take her away.

97
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:18,404
Go away.

98
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:19,614
Take her away.

99
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:20,572
Stop!

100
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,278
Captain.

101
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,251
This is the Captain of the County.

102
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:31,186
To hell with the captain!

103
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:34,149
Outrageous! Arrest him.

104
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,852
Let me go.

105
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,319
Who are you?

106
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,834
How dare you! I'm the captain.

107
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:52,772
You're drunk and indecently dressed.

108
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,559
Arrest both of them.

109
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,672
Get your hands off me.

110
00:09:58,548 --> 00:09:59,537
Let me go.

111
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:02,417
Please spare the girl, Captain.

112
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:03,851
That man was drunk.

113
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:05,714
It was not her fault.

114
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,662
Please don't arrest her.

115
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:08,757
Our business is new.

116
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:10,559
I rely on her to bring in guests.

117
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,295
How can a blind girl
be a top showgirl? Move!

118
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:16,026
She's a dancer with rare skills.

119
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,397
Please see for yourself.

120
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,468
Do you know the 'Echo Game'?

121
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,464
I played it once...

122
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:27,506
All right.

123
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,078
Perform well and I'll let you go.

124
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,054
Thank you, Captain.

125
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,986
Go and change quickly.

126
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,977
Fantastic.

127
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:04,005
Excellent!

128
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:21,760
Who are you, really?

129
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,526
Why do you want to kill me?

130
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:27,308
Government running dogs...

131
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,269
I wish to kill all of you!

132
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:36,007
I do enjoy fighting a blind girl.

133
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:33,824
We found this in her room.

134
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:48,991
You're a member of the 'Flying Daggers'.

135
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,211
Who's the new leader?

136
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,952
Where's the new leader?

137
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:04,355
I'll show you

138
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,161
what we'll do if you don't answer.

139
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:07,890
Show her!

140
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,760
In front of you is a torture device.

141
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:44,534
Your head will be put here.

142
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,005
Your shoulder, here.

143
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:53,774
Your back, here.

144
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:55,971
Your legs, here.

145
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:09,653
You'll never dance again after this.

146
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,639
Do you understand?

147
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:28,342
You have one day to think it over.

148
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,353
This girl reminds me of someone.

149
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:37,975
Who?

150
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:41,119
Rumor has it,

151
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,424
the old leader's blind daughter

152
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,355
disappeared after his death.

153
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:48,196
It was a heavy blow to
the 'Flying Daggers'.

154
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,587
They vowed revenge for their loss,

155
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:52,739
while searching for the girl.

156
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:59,205
Why would the old leader's daughter

157
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:01,440
end up in a brothel?

158
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,474
Who owns the Peony Pavilion?

159
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:10,152
Perhaps the 'Flying
Daggers' has realized

160
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:13,652
we were responsible for
their old leader's death.

161
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:14,921
Forget it.

162
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,392
Let's turn her over for a reward,

163
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:19,473
and then go out for a drink.

164
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:22,489
I have a better idea.

165
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,798
Since we have some clues,

166
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,320
let's follow them through
for a bigger reward.

167
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:31,778
Do you want me to do it?

168
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:34,225
Of course, who else?

169
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:39,812
All right. This girl is a rare beauty.

170
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:43,050
You know I love flirting with girls.

171
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:49,242
Don't let beauty blind your judgment.

172
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:53,631
If I die under a skirt, I
can still flirt as a ghost.

173
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:39,466
Who are you?

174
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:42,103
I undressed you only yesterday.

175
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,204
Have you forgotten me already?

176
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,126
Why did you rescue me?

177
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,313
Why do you think?

178
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:52,699
You're an exquisite flower.

179
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:55,406
I'll do anything to help you.

180
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:56,887
Control yourself.

181
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,240
Don't worry.

182
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:02,223
I'm no longer a guest
of the Peony Pavilion.

183
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:03,691
You're not a showgirl anymore.

184
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,422
You're the daughter of the old leader.

185
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,698
What did you say?

186
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:10,665
How many blind girls know martial arts

187
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,706
and carry daggers like these?

188
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,864
I've rescued you,

189
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:19,632
and your daggers as well.

190
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,318
Why did you take such a risk?

191
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:27,915
I hate the corrupt government

192
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,136
and admire the 'Flying Daggers'.

193
00:24:31,587 --> 00:24:32,576
Much obliged.

194
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,424
Why did we abandon the horses?

195
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:38,292
Hoof prints can be easily tracked.

196
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:40,793
I have two new horses hidden ahead.

197
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,454
You've planned well.

198
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,665
What's your name, Master?

199
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:47,164
Just call me Wind.

200
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:48,903
Wind?

201
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,198
I wander around all alone,

202
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,403
come and go without a trace.

203
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:54,985
Like a carefree wind?

204
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,504
No, a playful wind.

205
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:01,339
You like to tease.

206
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:03,713
I wonder what you look like?

207
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,542
That's easy to find out.

208
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,485
Here.

209
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:09,964
Please let go.

210
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,561
This isn't the Peony
Pavilion. No rules here.

211
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:17,272
You'll know what I look
like if you touch my face.

212
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:19,456
Come on.

213
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:23,762
It's not respectful to
touch your face first.

214
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:31,677
You prefer to start at the bottom.

215
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,614
That's fine with me.

216
00:25:34,683 --> 00:25:37,253
You've mastered the flying technique.

217
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,485
Your right hand is
skilled with a machete.

218
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:51,853
Your left hand is powerful
with a bow and arrow.

219
00:25:58,073 --> 00:26:01,440
Your heart beats
steadily, you seem sincere.

220
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:03,957
You can read me like a book.

221
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:06,153
You're a brave man.

222
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:09,078
I'm never shy around women.

223
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,365
You're young, indeed.

224
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,919
You know how to hold your drink.

225
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:30,727
The soldiers are approaching.

226
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,470
I've lost my dagger pouch.

227
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,248
I'm sorry I was late.

228
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:21,515
The 'Flying Daggers' are always moving.

229
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:22,949
Where should we go?

230
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:25,538
We just keep heading north.

231
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:27,648
Just head north?

232
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,287
They will come to us.

233
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:33,393
The 'Flying Daggers' has many masters.

234
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:35,662
Why did they send you as an assassin?

235
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:38,530
No one sent me. I came alone.

236
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:42,695
As the old leader's daughter,

237
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:44,738
you should be more cautious.

238
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,907
Have you considered the consequences?

239
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:50,241
I'll do anything to avenge my father.

240
00:33:58,653 --> 00:33:59,642
Come here.

241
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:17,912
These are men's clothes.
Put them on for now.

242
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,842
I won't take advantage of you.

243
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:38,495
Have you seen enough?

244
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:41,741
Please hand me the clothes.

245
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:45,825
You knew I was here?

246
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:49,029
Master Wind wanders like the wind.

247
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,230
I'd expect you to be anywhere.

248
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,550
You look different in men's clothes.

249
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:20,403
Do I look awful?

250
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:31,505
I will tell all the girls
to wear men's clothes

251
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:35,169
the next time I visit
the Peony Pavilion.

252
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:53,989
Now I know

253
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:56,855
you're not shy around women.

254
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,965
You're not shy either.

255
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:05,448
How do you know?

256
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:10,883
You knew I was watching you bathe,

257
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,879
yet you said nothing.

258
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,082
You saved my life.

259
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:22,347
You can look all you please.

260
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,166
I thought you were hot as fire.

261
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:49,675
In fact, you're cool as water.

262
00:38:53,114 --> 00:38:55,254
I don't know you well enough.

263
00:38:57,952 --> 00:38:59,647
I really care for you.

264
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:07,794
A playboy like you,
are you ever for real?

265
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,929
What if I am this time?

266
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,412
Are our men close by?

267
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:09,747
I'm sure today's
fighting has fooled Mei.

268
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:13,926
Our men will ease off from now on.

269
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:17,556
Good. That'll save me some arrows.

270
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,099
Any clues?

271
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:21,869
Not yet.

272
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:25,172
Don't let her see through you.

273
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:29,109
Don't worry. I never
fail at seducing a woman.

274
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:31,067
She trusts me.

275
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:36,142
I warn you, don't fall for her.

276
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,138
What do you mean fall?

277
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:41,279
Fall into bed?

278
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:47,188
Like her father, she
must be very cunning.

279
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,492
Don't let her fool you.

280
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:50,896
Don't be absurd.

281
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,758
I'm in control.

282
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,670
I have to get back now.

283
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:02,506
Don't turn a game into
reality and ruin our plan.

284
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,736
Who cares, as long as the plan works.

285
00:41:25,466 --> 00:41:27,376
Shall we rest for a while?

286
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,568
I smell flowers.

287
00:41:52,893 --> 00:41:53,882
You told me

288
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:57,709
you'd bring me to
where real flowers grow.

289
00:42:52,687 --> 00:42:54,667
Which is the most beautiful?

290
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,092
How do I look?

291
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,060
Pretty as a flower.

292
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:20,012
Soldiers are approaching.

293
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,036
I'm on your side.

294
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,113
You?

295
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,586
I am a Captain of the County.

296
00:43:59,587 --> 00:44:00,383
A captain?

297
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,190
Nonsense. You are the
bastard who broke the jail.

298
00:46:29,637 --> 00:46:31,787
You're wounded. Is it serious?

299
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:33,729
No.

300
00:48:22,016 --> 00:48:24,936
Was it someone from
the 'Flying Daggers'?

301
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:34,237
It's not likely.

302
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:38,987
Then who?

303
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:42,799
I don't know.

304
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:48,331
He's gone.

305
00:48:51,045 --> 00:48:54,125
I guess he doesn't
want to reveal himself.

306
00:49:37,524 --> 00:49:40,960
This time, I believe
that you're for real.
