1
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,071
Again.

2
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,991
What happened in that motel room?

3
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,913
It was coupon night
and I was trampolining your wife.

4
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,375
You're a real comedian, aren't you, Snow?

5
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:28,005
Well, I guess that's why they call it
the punch line.

6
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,716
You don't like me, do you?

7
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,760
Don't flatter yourself.
I don't like anybody.

8
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,471
With that attitude
I can see why nobody likes you.

9
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,098
Come on.

10
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,350
People love me.

11
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,185
Just ask your wife.

12
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:47,191
What happened in that room in New York?

13
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,986
What? What was the question?

14
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,538
What happened in that room?

15
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,424
<i>- Mace?
- Why do you never answer your phone?</i>

16
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,550
What the hell's going on?

17
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,302
<i>Listen. You have to get out, okay?</i>

18
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,949
<i>It's a double cross.
They're coming for you.</i>

19
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,513
<i>You have to get out now!</i>

20
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,265
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

21
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,186
Who was the mystery man on the phone?

22
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,270
His name was Fuck You.

23
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,022
- Really?
- Yeah, he was Asian.

24
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,403
I don't like hurting you, Snow.

25
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,364
Is that why you're having him do it?

26
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:20,701
I can have Rupert bludgeon you all night.

27
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,370
I'm being beaten up by a guy called Rupert?

28
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,456
What happened with the Colonel?

29
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,460
Shit.

30
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:32,963
Hey, buddy.

31
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,715
No, no, no, Frank.

32
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:36,634
You're gonna be fine.

33
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,428
Don't let them take this.

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,307
Yeah, okay.

35
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,601
Stay with me.

36
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,270
Come on, you're gonna be okay.

37
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,314
Frank.

38
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,094
Returning fire.

39
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,111
God, I hate heights.

40
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,513
Watch out!

41
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,721
<i>- Mace!
- Where are you?</i>

42
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,896
<i>Get to the subway, Wilson platform 10.</i>

43
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,232
<i>And dump the phone!
They're using it to track you!</i>

44
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,730
We have him now!

45
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,025
Don't move!

46
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,700
And that's when you showed up.

47
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,203
We had the Colonel under surveillance.

48
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,789
He was selling secrets
about our space programs.

49
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,998
Well, that's interesting

50
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,292
because Frank told me
he was protecting them.

51
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,170
Did he tell you this
before or after you killed him?

52
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,922
Why would I kill him?
He was a friend of mine.

53
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,507
You're right.

54
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,099
- That's not what happened.
- I saw it with my own eyes.

55
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,143
Running out of jokes, are we?

56
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,813
You setting me up? Is that what this is?

57
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:22,025
All we know is that the Colonel arranged
for a meeting in that motel

58
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,902
and somehow,

59
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,989
you showed up and killed him. Pop.

60
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,867
You know,
this may come as a surprise to you,

61
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,411
but Frank didn't trust you guys any more,

62
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,288
so he asked me to back him up.

63
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,041
He wanted someone from outside the agency.
You know, to protect the package.

64
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,334
Who was your backup guy?

65
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,628
Why do I get the feeling not telling you

66
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,380
is the only thing keeping him alive?

67
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,175
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Come on, guys.

68
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,843
Play nice.

69
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,846
- You mind?
- No. He's all yours.

70
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,264
Get those off of him, please.

71
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,312
I can't tell if he's stupid
or a really good liar.

72
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,106
Either way, M.S. One
would have been good for him.

73
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,819
Guy's a tool. Nut?

74
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,821
Nah, I'm trying to give them up.

75
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,241
I was sorry to hear about Frank.
He was one of the good guys.

76
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,203
Snow, you gotta give me something.

77
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,246
Otherwise, I can't help you.

78
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,248
Tell me what I can do to help, Snow.

79
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,042
Shoot Langral?

80
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,754
- Anything else?
- Can you pick me up something?

81
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,672
I can. What and where?

82
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,008
I don't know.

83
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,260
Last time I saw it, it was on a train.

84
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,197
Hey, buddy. Hey!

85
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,038
Tell me who the backup guy was.

86
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,373
You think I'm gonna tell you that?

87
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,500
You'll go straight to your boss.

88
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,177
Well, I guess this conversation's over.

89
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,391
It's good to see you.

90
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:26,817
I need a PolCom Tag
and a trace on a name. Mace.

91
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,623
- Mr. President.
- Scott, come in.

92
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,876
This is just routine.
Won't take two seconds.

93
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,378
Thank you.

94
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,881
They check this damn
thing five times a year.

95
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,260
So, what have we got?

96
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,262
He claims he was set up.

97
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,346
Was he?

98
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,933
I saw him shoot Armstrong
with my own eyes, sir.

99
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,603
What a mess!

100
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,813
So what do you want us to do about him?

101
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,898
I don't even want to know. Just fix it.

102
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,485
We're pretty much done here.
I just need to see the First Daughter.

103
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:14,156
Emilie has had a change in schedule.
She's on a humanitarian errand.

104
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,532
Is she even in Washington?

105
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,242
<i>Well, not exactly.</i>

106
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,870
<i>Ground control to LM22, do you copy?</i>

107
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,663
<i>- Loud and clear.
- It's amazing.</i>

108
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,916
- Is this your first time in orbit?
- No.

109
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,253
My father took me up in the Hilton Orbital
after my mother passed.

110
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,672
Would you like a quick briefing
before we arrive?

111
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:31,757
Please.

112
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,301
M.S. One
has been a very successful experiment

113
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,846
with the first 500 test cases
serving time without incident.

114
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,598
Once we open for business properly,

115
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:40,849
we'll be able to rent space

116
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,770
to 500,000 prisoners and counting,
with all countries signed up.

117
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,147
All overseen
by the United States of America.

118
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,273
Which is why I'm here.

119
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:52,527
M.S. One is the only Supermax facility
in existence

120
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,489
where there is no physical or sexual abuse,

121
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,449
breakouts or riots.

122
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,992
Because you put the prisoners to sleep?

123
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,535
It's called stasis.

124
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,372
Of course, but there are a few issues
with stasis, are there not?

125
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,166
Aggression due to damage of the cortex,

126
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,168
dementia, psychosis.

127
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,252
Well, you know the press.

128
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,798
Good news doesn't sell.

129
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,258
Those were early teething problems.

130
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,886
The U.S.
has absolutely nothing to worry about.

131
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,680
<i>You are entering United States airspace.</i>

132
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,702
We're approaching.
Would you like to see it?

133
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,640
I'd love to.

134
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,600
<i>This is penal area M. S. One.</i>

135
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,145
<i>446 requesting identification code.</i>

136
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,446
<i>LM22, we need your coordinates...</i>

137
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,658
The defense system is automatic
and solar assisted,

138
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,121
oxygen-fed, auto lock,
100-millimeter pacifiers

139
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,706
made by Milland aerospace.

140
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,166
<i>LM22, please transmit clearance.</i>

141
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,459
What are they doing?

142
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,296
Parts of M.S. One are still under
construction and need constant maintenance.

143
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,340
<i>LM22, you are on final approach.</i>

144
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,093
<i>Maintain your current speed and heading.</i>

145
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,559
- Can everyone please sign in?
- How are you, sir?

146
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,394
There are just a few
basic precautions here.

147
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:09,146
Won't take long.

148
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,690
- Thanks, Sam. Can I get my holster?
- There you go, sir.

149
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,736
Please, keep your radiation tags on you
at all times.

150
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,488
In the event of a problem,
they will beep and flash yellow.

151
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,198
Would you please take the elevator
to the third floor?

152
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,661
Mr. Barnes, isn't M.S. One's true purpose

153
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,956
to test the effects of deep
space exploration on humans?

154
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,666
Who better than guinea pigs with no rights?

155
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,334
I've heard that urban legend.

156
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:35,589
Look, Ms. Warnock,
these men aren't traffic offenders.

157
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,341
They've done some pretty awful things
to get in here.

158
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,676
Of course.

159
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,013
But is it purely coincidental
that one of the main sources of funding

160
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,390
is a deep space exploration company?

161
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:49,102
Surely you don't think they're paying out
millions of dollars to be civically minded?

162
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,272
Ms. Warnock, I'm just an old prison warden.

163
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,193
I couldn't speculate
on the motives of global corporations.

164
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,069
Anyway, isn't Milland aerospace

165
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,031
the largest contributor
to your charity group?

166
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,451
But one thing doesn't have to do
with the other.

167
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,702
Right?

168
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,330
Sure it doesn't.

169
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,250
We're going to put on a little show.

170
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:16,421
You'll get to meet a couple of convicts and
have a scary story to tell your friends.

171
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,631
And let's just hope

172
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,508
that when you sign off on this place,

173
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,844
we can all get back
to making the world a better place.

174
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,639
After you, ma'am.

175
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,059
This is General Population.

176
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,946
<i>All employees in Sector
4, please stand clear.</i>

177
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,115
Jesus.

178
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,327
Pretty impressive?

179
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,703
- Yes, it is.
- Now,

180
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,455
we've prepared an interview room for you.

181
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,249
We're going to need to have a look
at that room.

182
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,416
Well, that's fine.

183
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,585
One thing,
on the prisoners' side of the room,

184
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,045
we don't allow weapons.

185
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,633
Thank you.

186
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,093
Thanks.

187
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,100
- Okay?
- Yeah, all set.

188
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,279
There you are.

189
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,489
Yeah. I thought I could smell you coming.

190
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,491
I'm here to tell you the good news, Snow.

191
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,286
You're finally getting spayed?
Congratulations.

192
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,538
You've been convicted. First degree murder

193
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,625
and conspiracy to commit espionage
against the United States.

194
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,962
That's the setup.
Do you want to hear the punch line?

195
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,797
Yeah, I'm dying to.

196
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,133
M.S. One. 30-year stasis.

197
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,427
No parole. Effective immediately.

198
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,430
And nothing about a constitutional right
to a fair hearing?

199
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,974
I think you waived that right
when you shot Armstrong.

200
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,727
Yeah, of course.
I forgot that part. I'm sorry.

201
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,104
You know what they say
about being put under?

202
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,773
That some minds just can't take it.

203
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,859
I'm looking forward to it.

204
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,402
Sweet dreams.

205
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,835
I don't know about you,
but I can't drive home.

206
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,928
Mr. Hydell.

207
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,387
How are you feeling?

208
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,351
Are you experiencing any disorientation?

209
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,186
I can't see out of that eye any more.

210
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,355
And what happened to your face,
did you burn it?

211
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,690
Yeah, it's a love bite.

212
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,901
- I see.
- Yeah.

213
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,738
I'm going to ask you a few questions
about your experience and treatment here.

214
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,448
Do you dream while you're under?

215
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,618
Well, I'm gonna dream about you. Aren't I?

216
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,745
I'd appreciate it
if you'd take it seriously, though.

217
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,164
It's very serious. Very serious.

218
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,334
So, it says here you were convicted
of aggravated physical assault.

219
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:00,961
No,

220
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:05,090
I'm innocent. That wasn't me.
That's a case of mistaken identity.

221
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,217
Fifty-three counts?

222
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,386
I've a very familiar face.

223
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,429
It's not like your face.

224
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,391
You've a very kind face.

225
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,644
It's lovely. You're perfect, you are.
I bet you got a nice smile.

226
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,522
Do a little smile for me. Oh, smile.

227
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,606
You've got a lovely smile!

228
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,358
Easy.

229
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,986
- Hock.
- Answer the question.

230
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,445
Stay out of this, please.

231
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,073
What's that smell in here?

232
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,491
Calm down.

233
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,038
You're wearing perfume, aren't you?

234
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,374
- Mr. Hydell.
- Answer the question.

235
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,458
- Hock!
- You're a filthy article, man.

236
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,501
You are a bad man!

237
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,585
What's wrong with you? You wanna test me?

238
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,504
- Sit down!
- Hock!

239
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,631
- Okay. You wanna test me?
- Hock!

240
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,592
Do you know what I was
before I was convicted of rape, cock?

241
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,261
- Surprise me, shithead.
- Hock! Stop!

242
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,345
I was a pickpocket.

243
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,225
He's got a gun!

244
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,757
<i>M. S. One Control, we</i> are...

245
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:47,317
Sir? There seems to be a fire alarm
on M.S. One.

246
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,528
- Hide.
- What?

247
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,988
- Hide.
- What?

248
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,239
Hide?

249
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,993
Hello.

250
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,204
- Where is she?
- Who? Who? What? What?

251
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,040
"Who? Who? What? What?"
Don't lie to me, man. I'll eat your brain.

252
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:05,376
- I'm not lying to you, man.
- Control room active.

253
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,215
Stay there.

254
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,606
Hairdo!

255
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,568
Are you all right, man?
Have I hurt your nose?

256
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,946
Come here. Get up, man.

257
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,031
Come here.

258
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,741
Sit down.

259
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,702
Open them all up right now.
Every single one.

260
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,412
No, I don't think that's a good...

261
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,956
Think? You should think?

262
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,874
Okay. Okay. Okay.

263
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,211
<i>- Okay, okay, okay, okay. Get it done.
- Canisters open.</i>

264
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,895
Good. That's a good job, man.

265
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,900
<i>Remember, safety is our first priority.</i>

266
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,779
<i>It has been 364 days
since our last incident.</i>

267
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,490
<i>Good work, team.</i>

268
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,586
- Go! Go! Go!
- Come on.

269
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,749
No.

270
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,548
Damn.

271
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,519
Hit the sleeping gas. Hit it!

272
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,730
2, 3, 5...

273
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,194
Easy!

274
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,032
- Get up. Get up!
- No! No!

275
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,039
In less than an hour,

276
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,000
all these people, including young

277
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,045
Emilie Warnock here,

278
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,506
will be the only thing keeping us alive.

279
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,342
You don't mess with your poker chips.

280
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:06,516
<i>M. S. One, this is L.O.P.D.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

281
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,476
What's going on?

282
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,187
Company...

283
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,151
<i>Smoke leakage on the starboard hull,
possibly halon.</i>

284
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,696
Look who I found, man!

285
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,364
Get off the door, man.

286
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,449
Found you a proper egghead.

287
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,910
Turn on the guns. Here. Calm down.

288
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,996
There you go.

289
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,415
That's clever, isn't it? Okey-dokey.

290
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,500
Leave it.

291
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,627
Why leave it, man? Come on.

292
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,004
I said, leave it.

293
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,053
<i>Copy that.</i>

294
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,431
<i>Keep all eyes open. Full recon mission.</i>

295
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,474
<i>- Establish M. S. One status...
- Moving out.</i>

296
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,478
Serious.

297
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,109
Sorry!

298
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,448
<i>- We 're taking fire.
- They have opened fire.</i>

299
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,540
You think you're running the show?

300
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,126
Get this into your thick skull.

301
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,795
- You're not running the show.
- Sorry.

302
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,893
- Mr. President.
- Everybody out.

303
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,395
Now! Get out!

304
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,981
Sir, within the last hour,

305
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,484
there has been a massive infraction

306
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,944
on Supermax M.S. One.

307
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,446
- It's a takeover.
- Oh, God.

308
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,281
Emilie. Is she...

309
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,408
She's fine, according to her telemetry,

310
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,577
but the situation is critical.

311
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,955
We can have special forces up there
on site within six hours.

312
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,957
To do what exactly?

313
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:00,338
I just mean, what order do we give,
Mr. President?

314
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,340
- What are you saying?
- I'm asking,

315
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,134
are we talking about
saving all the hostages?

316
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,678
Or are we talking about saving
just one in particular?

317
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,722
Now we can send in the Marines,

318
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,933
but we have no real idea of the whereabouts

319
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,893
of your daughter on board.

320
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,437
As soon as we launch
this large-scale offensive,

321
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:17,980
my guess is...

322
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,483
Well, she's as good as dead, sir.

323
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:22,693
Or...

324
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,655
What?

325
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,490
We can send in one man.

326
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,411
One man with one very specific order.

327
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,663
To get Emilie Warnock out.

328
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:35,790
Who?

329
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,962
I'd rather castrate
myself with blunt rocks.

330
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,839
Why don't you get Rupert to do it?

331
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,048
Hey. How's it going?

332
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,050
This is the best offer you'll get.

333
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,927
Don't get me wrong. It's a dream vacation.

334
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,139
I mean, I load up, I go into space,

335
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,808
I get inside the maximum-security nuthouse,

336
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,561
save the President's daughter
if she's not dead already,

337
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,479
get past all the psychos
who've just woken up.

338
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,565
I'm thrilled that you would think of me.

339
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,193
See you in 30 years.

340
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,613
Wait.

341
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,825
Snow, you should really think about this.

342
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,411
Because it could benefit all of us.

343
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,046
Okay, I'm joking. I'll do it.

344
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,181
Frank's lighter.

345
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,586
Here, put this on.

346
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,517
<i>Please proceed to the shuttle immediately.</i>

347
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,354
<i>LM23, you are clear for takeoff.</i>

348
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,073
So, how many prisoners exactly?

349
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,950
497.

350
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,036
Mainly rapists and murderers.
You'll fit right in.

351
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,955
How do we know she's not dead already?

352
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,165
She's wearing
a telemetry medical transmitter.

353
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:42,792
All the First Family have them.

354
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,336
- Nice to live in the big white house?
- So we know she's alive.

355
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:50,216
And she has had some blood loss,
but it's nothing life-threatening. So far.

356
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:55,096
So, if I actually find
her and she is alive,

357
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,806
how do we get off the ship?

358
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,516
Easy. Hitch a ride, man.

359
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,977
There's an escape pod on level five.

360
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,229
It's not on any of the schematics,

361
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,731
but you can find it on this map.

362
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:06,983
It'll guide you to the pod

363
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:09,986
and give you the access code.

364
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,698
The pod will take the two of you
off M.S. One.

365
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:14,907
Is that clear?

366
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,075
Yeah, clear as mud.

367
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,077
- Here.
- What's that for?

368
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,580
Climbing down off sidewalks?

369
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,664
No, no, no.

370
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:25,835
It's explosives. You join those two ends,
you got a nine-second charge.

371
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:30,006
It's grade two, for opening
heavy secure panels or bulkheads.

372
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,382
Bulkheads?

373
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,233
- I gotta get out of here.
- That's enough!

374
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,651
I gotta get out of here.

375
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,076
That's okay.

376
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,536
You go to sleep now.

377
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,043
Anyone else?

378
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,758
I'm gonna need a doctor
to get this stitched up.

379
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,056
Thank you.

380
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,308
Hey, lab coat.

381
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,477
You, move! Doc, let's go.

382
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,937
- Hey, wait, she's not a doctor.
- Easy there, tough guy. Easy.

383
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,815
Okay.

384
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:30,608
Let's go. Get your ass up.
Get your ass up.

385
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:40,618
Stitch it up.

386
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,510
Hey, wait a second.
What the hell is going on here?

387
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,345
We're taking over.

388
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:00,971
And who are you?

389
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:03,265
Secret Service.

390
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,309
I didn't hear anything about this.

391
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:08,729
That will be why they
call it secret, right?

392
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,398
What's happening?

393
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,066
They demanded a negotiator.

394
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,069
He's prepping now.
They've been leaving a live feed open.

395
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,365
This is Special Agent Scott Langral

396
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,659
and I'm in charge of this situation.

397
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,161
<i>In charge?</i>

398
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,623
<i>That's where you're very much mistaken.</i>

399
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,586
So there she is.
Right in the hornet's nest.

400
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,255
Let me know when you've picked up on it,
won't you?

401
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,465
When I want your opinion,
I'm gonna give it to you.

402
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:39,969
Okay.

403
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:41,804
Hey.

404
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,556
Picked up on what?

405
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,182
Oh, nothing. You know,

406
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,852
just that they don't know they've got
the President's daughter, that's all.

407
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:51,939
So,

408
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,692
- do you like working in space?
- Yeah, I like it.

409
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,069
- You do? Do you get dizzy?
- Yeah, sometimes.

410
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,404
Sometimes? Yeah, I would.

411
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,948
Hey, Snow. How do you figure that out?

412
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,743
Far be it from me to teach you
how to suck eggs,

413
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,828
but you'd think
they might have said something.

414
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,040
And they've got her playing doctor.
I'm just saying.

415
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,753
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention?</i>

416
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,672
<i>We've prepared a little demonstration.</i>

417
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,762
Barnes? Hello, Barnes?

418
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,014
Gotta make sure, man. Let me find...

419
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,477
Listen, if you're gonna shit yourself,
now would be the perfect time, wouldn't it?

420
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,853
Go on, boys.

421
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,938
No. No!

422
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,317
Here we go.

423
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,860
Reality TV.

424
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,821
- No! No!
- Oh, no!

425
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:41,906
No, no, no, no.

426
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,699
- I can help you!
- Can you help me?

427
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,994
- I can help you!
- You're gonna need the help, boyo.

428
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,537
It's a bit chilly out there tonight.

429
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,122
Don't do this.

430
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:53,626
Don't do this. Wait! Wait! I can help you!

431
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:55,836
Wait!

432
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,381
Bye-bye, Barnes.

433
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,884
Bye-bye, Barnes.

434
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,136
No, I can help. Wait! The girl!

435
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,262
What about her?

436
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,515
The girl! The girl!

437
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,517
- She's the President's...
- Yep.

438
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,063
Man! Did you see the look on his face?

439
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,606
He was about to say something.

440
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,900
He was about to say something like...

441
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:23,948
Okay.

442
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,493
<i>The clock is reset.</i>

443
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,787
<i>One hour and counting until the next show,</i>

444
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,206
<i>so I'd get my skates on if I were you.</i>

445
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:37,795
Hey, tell me you are not still thinking
of negotiating with these psychos.

446
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,464
This is all over the news in six hours.

447
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,674
Then they're going to know who she is.

448
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,342
We should just stick to the plan.

449
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,469
The plan?
You can send your boy in if you want.

450
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:48,222
I'm just doing what's best
for the situation right now.

451
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:49,682
Right?

452
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,100
Thank you.

453
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,978
- I'm happy not to go.
- You're going.

454
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,604
- Okay.
- Go now.

455
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:57,773
All right.

456
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,959
Hey, easy, easy, big guy...

457
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,587
It's all right. It's okay. It's okay, easy.

458
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,298
Things you asked for are on the way.

459
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,383
Is everybody okay?

460
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,262
For the time being, sure.

461
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,390
We're doing our bit. I was wondering,
what are you going to do for us?

462
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:34,602
Don't tell me, you're
looking for a hostage.

463
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,687
That certainly would be a good start.

464
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,022
Hey, four eyes.

465
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,316
Ain't no one leaving, man.

466
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,151
No. You hear me? No.

467
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,154
Can I talk to you privately for a minute?

468
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,411
If this works
I'll wear a tutu and pink pantyhose.

469
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,622
<i>Snow, let's be ready, okay?</i>

470
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,208
<i>Okay.</i>

471
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,466
This thing is contained right now.

472
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,593
But you keep blasting
people out the airlock,

473
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,930
the press gets involved and all bets
are off and nobody goes anywhere.

474
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,849
Now, you look like a smart guy,
so I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

475
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,059
They're going to let you go.

476
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,312
But you really think
they're gonna let 500 convicts go?

477
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,814
You, maybe five or six others,
can get out of here.

478
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,107
It's what we call breakage.

479
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:23,525
Why should I give up a hostage?

480
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,195
You know why they really ask for a hostage,
don%you?

481
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,823
<i>Because it tells them one important thing.
This guy is in charge here.</i>

482
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,825
Maybe you're not the guy
who makes decisions around here.

483
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,453
Don't go there.

484
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,914
<i>I'm definitely the man
you should be talking to.</i>

485
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,333
Okay, all right.
Show me you're in charge then.

486
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,751
Give me a hostage.

487
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,337
- Can I trust you?
- You can trust me.

488
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,302
Let's hold on.

489
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,847
This stuffed shirt may well pull this off.

490
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,726
<i>Jesus! Coming, going. Make up your minds.</i>

491
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,104
- One hostage?
- One.

492
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,940
- Who do you want?
- Whoever. Usually one of the wounded,

493
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,609
or, I don't know, maybe a woman.

494
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:08,195
A wounded woman's always popular.

495
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,655
Okay, we got eight principals,

496
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:13,117
four low-vel riot shotguns, three Berettas,
low-vel semis.

497
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,578
You choose.

498
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:26,755
Up. Get up.

499
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,590
- Why me?
- Get up.

500
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,926
Honey, you'll be fine.

501
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,929
Looks like my plan is working.

502
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,931
Sorry.

503
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:41,603
What's going on here?

504
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,981
Not her. Not her. No, no, no, no. Not her.

505
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,524
A decision's been made.

506
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,360
Please, man. Not her. Not that one, no.
Pick another one.

507
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,237
Crawl back under your stone.

508
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,990
Don't say that.

509
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,409
This woman needs medical assistance.
Come on.

510
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,307
I didn't realize. I forget.

511
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:59,121
I just let myself run away
with myself, you know.

512
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:00,914
You want a wounded hostage?

513
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,167
- No!
- Back off.

514
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,918
Go see to your friends, Cock.

515
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:07,254
No.

516
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,841
You wanted a wounded hostage
and now you have one, don't you?

517
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,677
Everybody's happy. Everybody wins.

518
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,138
- You're happy. Yeah?
- Kathryn, it's gonna be okay.

519
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,347
Snow, it's gone bad.

520
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,725
<i>You gotta get in there, man. Get in there.</i>

521
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,989
Kathryn, we're gonna get you home, okay?

522
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:35,699
Kathryn.

523
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:38,577
<i>It's a setup.
There's some guy outside climbing on board.</i>

524
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,705
Kathryn, I just need you
to breathe with me.

525
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,916
Listen, I was just doing
what I was supposed...

526
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,294
Kathryn.

527
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,796
Kathryn, look at me.

528
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,090
I really... l... Please...

529
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:53,008
You said I could trust you.

530
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,260
Listen, I was just gonna... Please.

531
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,973
<i>Bring them back inside.</i>

532
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,520
Come on, Emilie, let's go.

533
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,655
Come on now.

534
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,617
Do something useful.

535
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,578
Go find that man and kill him.

536
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:24,248
I don't wanna see you till it's done.

537
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,544
Why don't we just kill that lunatic?

538
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,297
Because he's my brother.

539
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,885
Okay. Hold on, nearly there. Okay, got it.

540
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:41,431
You need to look around
and you should see a sealed port.

541
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,308
<i>- You got it?
- Yeah, I see it.</i>

542
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:46,854
<i>Okay. I need you to pull back
on the small quick release.</i>

543
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:47,980
<i>Right.</i>

544
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,112
<i>Are you in?</i>

545
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,572
<i>Snow.</i>

546
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,115
Snow?

547
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,703
Snow, can you hear me?

548
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,336
Warnock?

549
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,927
There you are.

550
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,647
Come on.

551
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,485
Wait, wait, wait. This way.

552
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,253
We'll be safe here.
Nothing getting through that.

553
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,421
- So what now?
- We wait.

554
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,841
They're sending the Marines.
It won't be long.

555
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,677
Snow, what's going on?

556
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,722
You know, global warming,

557
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,016
<i>some celebrity is getting a boob-job,</i>

558
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,727
Congress is screwing the pooch again.

559
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:53,105
- You know, same old.
- Snow.

560
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:55,983
Come on, man.
I mean, what's going on there?

561
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,110
Oh, yeah. Well,

562
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,487
<i>your wildcat smacked me in the head
with a fire extinguisher</i>

563
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,697
<i>and locked herself in some room.</i>

564
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,283
So she's safe. Send the cavalry.

565
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:11,456
Listen, Snow. You stick to the plan.
You better do your job

566
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:14,334
<i>or I'll hit you with a Sherman tank.
Got that?</i>

567
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,253
A Sherman tank? Yeah, right.

568
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:18,505
Toss my caber, Langral.

569
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,882
- I've got other things to do.
- Hey, Snow...

570
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:48,243
The answer to all our problems
lies behind this door.

571
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,579
Get me a security engineer.

572
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,707
Actually,

573
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,626
bring me two.

574
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,352
Snow, can you hear me?

575
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:14,644
<i>Snow.</i>

576
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,688
<i>Come on, Snow.</i>

577
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,690
Snow, can you hear me? It's Langral.

578
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,859
<i>I want you to go in and get her. Now.</i>

579
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,445
Actually, that's a little inconvenient
right now.

580
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,781
<i>I don't care.</i>

581
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,783
She's losing oxygen. She's suffocating.

582
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,242
<i>You understand?</i>

583
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,286
- You're making this up, right?
- Snow, <i>it's Harry</i> here.

584
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,831
This is for real.
At the current rate of nitrogen buildup,

585
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:36,792
she will be dead in... How long?

586
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,460
Five minutes, man.

587
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,462
Yeah. Well, contrary to popular belief,

588
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,715
I'm not actually Houdini and those things
are designed to be impregnable.

589
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,343
So, I'm not sure what
you're asking me to do.

590
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,931
You all right?

591
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,019
Yeah.

592
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,065
No.

593
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:11,660
Hopefully, this will short-circuit me the
inevitable "it can't be done" discussion.

594
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,162
I need this door open.

595
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,004
<i>You should see a ladder in front of you.
Do you see it?</i>

596
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,172
Yeah.

597
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,340
Okay, I need you to take it.

598
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:32,806
<i>And then, when you're over,
you gotta go straight ahead.</i>

599
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:43,859
<i>And here's where it gets
a little bit tricky.</i>

600
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,872
<i>I need you to get to the other side.
Correct?</i>

601
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,375
What do you want me to do, fly?

602
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:02,294
'Cause I think I left my cape at home.

603
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,504
I need you to listen to this, buddy. Go.

604
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:07,382
The gravity generated by the torsion system
will hold you up.

605
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:13,388
<i>You gotta trust me on this.
You should just glide right over.</i>

606
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,473
Really?

607
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:19,269
<i>Snow?</i>

608
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:22,898
<i>Snow!</i>

609
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,905
<i>Snow, there is no time for hanging around.</i>

610
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,396
What is that?

611
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,624
All channels.

612
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,167
Snow, can you hear me?

613
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,589
Reactivate the torsion.

614
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,523
What is that?

615
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:54,531
- They're trying to get it open.
- Can they do that?

616
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,579
This may take a bit longer.

617
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,999
That really is unfortunate.

618
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:09,671
We're gonna need a new engineer.

619
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:12,007
This one's sprung a leak.

620
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,431
<i>Okay, so that was easy, right?</i>

621
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,517
<i>Are you at the hatch? Snow?</i>

622
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,732
Your two minutes start now.

623
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:33,111
Shoot me if you want, but I can guarantee
this open if you give me five minutes.

624
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,863
Good sales pitch.

625
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,366
<i>Oxygen levels depleted.</i>

626
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,659
Oh, God, no.

627
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:42,037
<i>Please seek medical assistance.</i>

628
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,290
<i>Please seek medical assistance.</i>

629
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,418
Okay, Emilie, listen to me very carefully.

630
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,713
Nitrogen is lighter than oxygen,
so there will be more at floor level.

631
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,923
Breathe shallow but steady.

632
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,051
Keep your heart rate low.

633
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,430
I'm sorry.

634
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:11,816
Something happened.
Somehow she found more oxygen,

635
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:13,360
but that will only give us a minute or so.

636
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,321
<i>Snow, you gotta get in there.</i>

637
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:19,908
<i>EEG activity declining.
Brain death in 20 seconds.</i>

638
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,451
- Twenty seconds.
- Lost him.

639
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:22,744
Twenty seconds and then this is all over.

640
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,081
Yeah. I should've stayed in college.

641
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,253
Okay.

642
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:35,256
Hot girl on the floor, big hole in her leg.

643
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,592
Okay, first let's get the motor going.

644
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,470
<i>Open the medi-pack.
You need to get the defib kit.</i>

645
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:41,554
Fifteen seconds.

646
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:43,640
You know the counting thing?
It's not very relaxing.

647
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:46,810
Gel them, place them on the chest,
center under the right arm.

648
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:48,937
- Make sure they stay on her.
- Ten seconds.

649
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:50,063
And...

650
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,608
Bingo! Got an induced-pulse.

651
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:54,984
<i>Seven, six...</i>

652
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,861
- So why is there still counting?
- Not done yet.

653
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:59,155
<i>Find the Vidadermic labeled "20 ccs. ".</i>

654
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,324
- Serotonin nor epinephrine.
- What the hell do I do with this?

655
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,201
<i>It's a neurotransmitter stimulant.</i>

656
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,204
You've got to push the needle through
the center of her right eye into the brain.

657
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,289
Come on, you're kidding me, right?

658
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,125
Move it around until it
locates the thalamus.

659
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,419
<i>It's self-guiding. Then fire it.</i>

660
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:13,795
Okay.

661
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:23,638
I'm gonna be sick.

662
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,309
<i>Okay. We've got some activity.</i>

663
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:31,521
Yeah, we've got activity all right.
She's doing the lambada in here.

664
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,815
<i>- Get some air in there.
- What, mouth to mouth?</i>

665
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,150
<i>Mouth to mouth.</i>

666
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:36,943
Here we go.

667
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,492
Hey!

668
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,161
It's okay, it's okay.

669
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,330
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm bringing you back from the dead.

670
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,312
I was dead?

671
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:52,959
Yeah, and so far I think
I prefer you that way.

672
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,837
Come on, that's enough foreplay.
We gotta get out of here.

673
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,677
You! Let's go. Come on.

674
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,013
Back to the kennel!

675
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:14,314
Shit.

676
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:24,199
Watch your head.

677
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,034
Take the next left.

678
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:27,786
Okay, this way.

679
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:30,121
<i>Then go about 50 feet.</i>

680
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,665
<i>But watch your back, man. Remember Kiev.</i>

681
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,542
Hold it, her BP is dropping.

682
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,169
<i>She's losing too much blood.</i>

683
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,297
<i>Hey, Snow, docs say check Emilie's leg.</i>

684
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,925
Yeah. I'll put it on the to-do list.

685
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,059
You're almost there, buddy.

686
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,279
I understand you're the prison's
communications expert.

687
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:05,406
I've a job for you.

688
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,410
Bollocks.

689
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,502
<i>Now it is vitally important
that you go the right way.</i>

690
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,672
<i>Whatever you do, for Christ's sake,
don't go down the...</i>

691
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,590
Harry? Harry.

692
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:24,342
Hey, Snow. Can you hear me?

693
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,135
Shit!

694
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:28,680
They've cut transmission.

695
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,098
Who did?

696
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,893
The little transmission fairies.
Who do you think?

697
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:35,937
Greg, what the hell is happening here?

698
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,231
- This way.
- Are you sure?

699
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,191
- Yeah.
- You don't sound sure.

700
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,860
Well, lam.

701
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:46,489
It's electromagnetic lockout.

702
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:47,574
Christ.

703
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:51,786
Find a way to get me back in
because we're flying blind here.

704
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,542
I thought you said you were sure.

705
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,712
You're really a lot of fun, you know that?

706
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:02,964
Come on, don't worry. It's perfectly safe.

707
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:14,893
You don't have to do that!

708
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:16,436
A simple "thank you" is enough.

709
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:19,772
Asshole.

710
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:21,983
So,

711
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,278
well, we lost them, huh?

712
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:28,990
Right.

713
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,409
Sorry.

714
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:32,660
Up you get.

715
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:34,829
Thank you.

716
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:41,878
Yuck.

717
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,349
Who are you?

718
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,435
Who sent you?

719
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:58,853
Your old man did.

720
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,147
My dad.

721
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:03,358
What did he say?

722
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,069
Well, I didn't get to meet him personally.
He kind of delegated your rescue.

723
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,237
He had a big conference
on the corn surplus.

724
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,322
You're kidding me?

725
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,783
No. No, apparently,
we should all be eating more corn.

726
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:12,867
About my father.

727
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:14,577
Oh, yeah, I made that other bit up.

728
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:17,372
- Did he have a message for me?
- Yes, you are adopted.

729
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:22,460
Are you the only type of jerk
they found for this kind of mission?

730
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,962
The only one stupid enough to say yes.

731
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,925
So, what's the plan?

732
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,971
Surely you have a plan
to rescue the hostages?

733
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:36,057
- What hostages?
- The hostages. The staff, the guards.

734
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,684
Should I write it out in crayon?

735
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:41,145
I came here to rescue you
and mission accomplished.

736
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:42,814
And quite well, I might add.

737
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:48,486
Are you just thrilled being yourself
all day or is it a part-time job?

738
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:51,698
I'm not kidding. We can't just leave them.

739
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:53,783
- Leave who?
- The hostages!

740
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:57,996
- What is that?
- That's to stop the bleeding.

741
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,247
And hopefully, the talking.

742
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,754
They will die if we leave them.

743
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,965
Listen, we're not going back to rescue
any hostages, okay?

744
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,342
We're getting out of here,
after I do one thing.

745
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:12,844
There. That's the plan.

746
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,345
Are you always this obnoxious?

747
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,559
Did you hear something?

748
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:23,604
No, I'm just enjoying the silence.

749
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,356
You asshole.

750
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,276
We are not leaving them.

751
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:31,154
Listen, it's really very sweet of you,

752
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,905
but there's not a lot of room
for anybody else, okay?

753
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:35,491
It's kind of a VIP deal, get it?

754
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,411
What I get is, you're a selfish dick...

755
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:44,000
That'll freeze the nerves in this spot
for 24 hours.

756
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,084
You want some on your mouth?

757
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:47,879
No?

758
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:01,059
- Okay, see here on the map?
- Yeah.

759
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:02,393
That's where the pod is. You get in it,

760
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:04,812
you fly away and the good guys will come
and get you. Okay?

761
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,147
On my own?

762
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,648
You're a big girl, right?

763
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,150
Here's an apple. And a gun.

764
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,861
Don't talk to strangers. Shoot them.

765
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,990
This is the plan you agreed on
with my father?

766
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:18,117
Yeah, he said it'll toughen you up.
Apparently, you need that.

767
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,328
Well, I'm sure I'll be

768
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,289
fine. Where are you going?

769
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:25,333
I've got a hot date.

770
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,753
It's been a real slice, so good luck.
And good luck with the leg thing.

771
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,005
Okay.

772
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:39,347
Okay, the map.

773
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:42,308
You gotta flip it. It's upside down.

774
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,435
No, no. So you can see the screen.

775
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,063
Which way's north?

776
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:51,609
Okay, we're in space now.
So it's not north, it's port and starboard.

777
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:54,529
Thanks.

778
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,496
You're doing great.

779
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,498
<i>Can I have your attention?</i>

780
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,918
<i>You want to get out of here?
Our meal ticket is a woman.</i>

781
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:11,504
<i>And she's been on the run
for some time now.</i>

782
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:12,713
<i>We need her alive</i>

783
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,716
<i>and we need her as soon as possible.</i>

784
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,803
<i>Now, they're going to try
and leave the station.</i>

785
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,265
<i>Watch everywhere.</i>

786
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:26,602
Yeah, okay, you can tag along,
but maybe don't talk.

787
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:28,437
Just keep it zipped.

788
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,606
Here, give me the map.

789
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:33,901
Okay, we go this way.

790
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,363
North.

791
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,909
<i>Smiler!</i>

792
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:43,911
<i>Are you there?</i>

793
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:46,747
<i>Sweetheart, I miss you. Smiler!</i>

794
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,249
Hey, why do they do that?

795
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,333
Do what?

796
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,418
The marking on the face.

797
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,795
Other prisoners do it to them.
Lets everyone know you're a rat.

798
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,630
Here, put these on.

799
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,675
- No.
- They don't come in pink.

800
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:01,137
You can't walk past 500 whack jobs
dressed like a chick.

801
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,723
Oh, so this is part of your plan.

802
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,517
So kind of you to clue me in.

803
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,352
You can't smoke in here.

804
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:10,396
All evidence to the contrary.

805
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,360
So...

806
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:17,695
So, what do I call you?

807
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,740
You know what? Don't call me.

808
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,453
- What's your name?
- Snow.

809
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,121
- Snow?
- Yeah.

810
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:29,040
Or Sir. You can decide.

811
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,166
What's your first name?

812
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:32,418
Snow.

813
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,837
Your name is Snow Snow?

814
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:37,381
Well, that's just ridiculous.

815
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:39,717
- Why won't you tell me your name?
- I just did.

816
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,302
No, you didn't.

817
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,387
What is that?

818
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,519
Engine oil, coffee,
some water I just got out of the toilet.

819
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,647
And just what do you plan on doing with it?

820
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,316
I plan on putting it in your hair.

821
00:53:56,817 --> 00:54:00,863
If you would like to play witness
protection and shampoo in toilet water,

822
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:02,865
be my guest. Not me.

823
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,868
Come on. It'll be fun.

824
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:07,870
Not on your life.

825
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:10,581
God, stop!

826
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,668
It stinks!

827
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,004
- Enough!
- There you go.

828
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,675
Wasn't that fun?

829
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:23,344
- You're a pig.
- Thank you.

830
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:28,683
You always treat women this way?

831
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,269
Always. Well, only if I like them.

832
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:33,604
You have any idea
what my father would do to you?

833
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:36,774
Jeez! Not raise taxes again?

834
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:37,858
Here.

835
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,779
Yeah, you look good.

836
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:43,823
Though, something's missing.

837
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:45,783
What?

838
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:50,538
It's okay, it's okay. It's only cosmetic.
It's only cosmetic. It's nothing personal.

839
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:53,833
Here, look, look.
It'll probably save your life.

840
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,168
You look tough now, see?

841
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,469
You really are a naughty
boy, Special Agent.

842
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,346
<i>What, you thought we wouldn't find out?</i>

843
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,307
Don't know what you're talking about.

844
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:12,310
You tell Warnock that we have his daughter.

845
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,437
<i>And unless we get what we want,</i>

846
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:19,775
you tell your boss
that I've got 500 pent-up convicts

847
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:24,113
<i>all too eager to educate his little girl.</i>

848
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,656
Okay.

849
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:27,908
What do you want?

850
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,429
What's happened?

851
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,014
Is Emilie okay?

852
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,773
What's going on here, man?

853
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:01,817
What's it look like?
We're going on a hunting trip.

854
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:06,113
You're going to get her?
I mean, let me come.

855
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,324
- No.
- Don't leave me behind, man.

856
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:09,617
What am I gonna do here?

857
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:10,910
Nothing.

858
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:15,039
And don't do anything stupid when I'm gone.
All right?

859
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,758
Okay. This is Main Containment,
so don't draw attention to yourself.

860
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,594
And what if this doesn't work?

861
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,137
Well, then we're probably gonna die.

862
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,555
Is that your idea of encouragement?

863
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,975
What can I say? I'm sorry it's not one of
your fancy presidential society functions.

864
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:36,811
Where do you get these ideas about me?

865
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:40,189
I don't know. You know, you just don't seem
like the kind of girl who'd go bowling.

866
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:43,484
Excuse me? Bowling?
I happen to be great at bowling.

867
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:45,569
Really? You go bowling?

868
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,239
Yeah. Every Tuesday.
There's a lane at the White House.

869
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:51,992
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

870
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:53,369
That is hardly my fault.

871
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:55,454
Careful,
you're starting to sound like your old man.

872
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,040
Here. Not even loaded.

873
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,845
Dude, you're a dude, okay?

874
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:19,103
Hey, you! Yeah, you.

875
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,313
You know who we're talking to.

876
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,282
What are you looking for?

877
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:32,575
Mace.

878
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,034
Like the spray?

879
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,079
No, not like the spray.

880
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,309
Mace!

881
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:01,061
Shit!

882
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,898
Can I help you?

883
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,570
No. Well, you could get out of the way.

884
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,238
No problem.

885
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:15,618
Just give me the password.

886
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:16,827
Yeah.

887
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:18,412
I like your pretty boy buddy.

888
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:22,541
Does he like to party?

889
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,503
Yeah. Like it's 1999.

890
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:26,879
Don't you?

891
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:30,424
You don't know the password.

892
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,385
Then there's a penalty.

893
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,264
Get them!

894
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:48,692
The door's jammed!

895
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:49,985
Here, shoot them, will you?

896
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:56,742
Jesus, I thought you were a Democrat.

897
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:07,002
Mace! Come on.

898
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,843
Mace! You son of a bitch.

899
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:16,303
You Okay?

900
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:18,556
Okay. Okay.

901
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:20,808
Bitch, son of a bitch.

902
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:22,643
What the hell's wrong with you, buddy?

903
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,812
Buddy? Buddy, YOU...

904
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:26,981
Buddy, you be. No.

905
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,066
No. Not to be. No. Wrong!

906
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,150
What's going on, man?

907
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,238
I know what this is. It's dementia.

908
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,365
Come on, he's like 35.

909
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:37,658
It's from the stasis.

910
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,368
Some people just unravel.

911
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,619
Gravel.

912
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:46,166
- So, it is true.
- True, true, true, true.

913
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,711
True blue. Union stew.

914
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,337
To do or not to do. Right?

915
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:51,422
No, wrong.

916
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,175
Wrong. Lullaby, lullaby,
lullaby, lullaby...

917
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:58,512
Shit.

918
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:08,564
I need you to get me something.

919
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:10,941
Now you're asking a crazy man
where he hid a briefcase

920
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:12,568
that you threw away
in a crowded subway station?

921
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:15,696
Mace? Remember the case? The package?

922
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:17,573
In the train station.
I threw it to you on the train.

923
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,199
Where'd you put it?

924
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,367
Right.

925
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:22,870
Yeah, no, I put it...

926
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,165
Yeah?

927
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,959
In my pants.

928
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,006
- In your pants?
- Yeah. Sister Mary said it was bad

929
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:36,967
to take it out in church
in front of the other kids.

930
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:41,138
When you do bad things, the angels,
they cry. That's what Sister Mary says.

931
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,161
It's a disruption in his
cortical circuitry.

932
01:00:43,162 --> 01:00:45,100
It's why I'm here.

933
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,561
It's just bad news. That's what it is.

934
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,857
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

935
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,692
Wait a minute. Why are you bringing him?

936
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:56,153
- He's one of them. He's safer without us.
- I need him.

937
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,529
For what? This phantom briefcase?

938
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:59,865
You'd be lucky to get a recipe
for mud pies out of this guy.

939
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:02,743
He's coming with us, okay? End of story.

940
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,246
I know exactly what I'm doing.

941
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:14,505
Don't let them get away!

942
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,633
Come on. God damn it!

943
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:19,885
Get them! Over here!

944
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,345
Okay, this way! This way!

945
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:22,429
Come on.

946
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:25,182
- Put a light down there.
- Gotta go.

947
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,392
GO, go:

948
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,810
Gotta go!

949
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,398
- Go, go.
- Go, go. Okay. Go.

950
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:51,125
Porn horn.

951
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:14,732
Okay, come on.

952
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,493
Man.

953
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:31,498
- Oh, God!
- Come on, Mace! Mace!

954
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,125
Hit the panic button!

955
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,960
- Come on, buddy. Hit the panic button.
- Button, button. Mutton.

956
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:36,670
The button. Hit the panic button.

957
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:38,839
- Hit the panic button, Mace. Come on!
- Button.

958
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,591
Son of a bitch.

959
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:41,759
Button.

960
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:43,969
Son of a bitch.

961
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,600
Shit! Hold on, buddy. Wait there!

962
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,518
Oh, dear. Locked.

963
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:53,896
Lock. Locker. Locker.

964
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,148
Green. Beans. Locker.

965
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:57,691
Mace. Mace.

966
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,151
Mace.

967
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:00,611
Mace. Case.

968
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:02,780
Chase. Lullaby.

969
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:05,282
Mace, case.

970
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:07,743
I foresee you.

971
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,286
- I see you.
- What?

972
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:12,664
I see you.

973
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,335
I foresee you. Lullaby.

974
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:19,963
- I foresee you.
- Hold on, buddy. Come on.

975
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:23,425
Come on.

976
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,896
God damn it!

977
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,749
If you want something done...

978
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:01,088
We need a change of plan 'round here.

979
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:07,427
Well, that's that then.

980
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:14,601
I'm sorry.

981
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:16,478
Yeah, right. I'm sure you are.

982
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:19,314
I know he was your friend.

983
01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:21,149
I don't need your sympathy, okay?
Neither does he.

984
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:22,776
No.

985
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:25,737
No, he needed a friend
who wouldn't hang him out to dry.

986
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:28,699
Yeah, I'm taking the rap for something
I didn't do, okay? I didn't put him here.

987
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:34,121
Who cares? People die all the time.
It's no big deal.

988
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,456
How many people have died for you
since you got here?

989
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,793
But you're the President's daughter,
so you're worth it, right?

990
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:42,337
Looks like your little PR trip
got all screwed up.

991
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:44,486
I came here to ensure
that people were being

992
01:04:44,487 --> 01:04:46,550
treated fairly and
decently, unlike yourself.

993
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:50,012
You know, it's easy to be a saint
with nothing on the line.

994
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:51,680
You wait till you've got a
serious sacrifice to make

995
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:54,766
and then you'll find out
who you really are.

996
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,185
Most people run for cover.

997
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,229
But not you, right?

998
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:00,731
- No.
- No.

999
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:03,108
You just sacrifice your friends.

1000
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:15,787
<i>Sorry, hold on.</i>

1001
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,500
You're saying that the International
Space Station ran into M.S. One?

1002
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,377
No, I'm saying the opposite.

1003
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:25,130
M.S. One
ran into the International Space Station.

1004
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,673
I thought it was locked in orbit.

1005
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,885
It was controlled by a
geo-orbital technician.

1006
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,553
And where is this technician?

1007
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:32,930
They blew him out an airlock.

1008
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:36,600
Look, M.S. One is essentially
a big fly-by-wire system.

1009
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:40,228
Without constant monitoring,
it's basically falling out of the sky.

1010
01:05:40,896 --> 01:05:41,897
What's the bottom line?

1011
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,232
- Best guess?
- Please.

1012
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:46,777
Impact with the Eastern Seaboard
in eight hours.

1013
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:53,158
Can you get me a secure line
to Jack Tallis at Justice?

1014
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,832
Bingo.

1015
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,793
It's a rescue mission!

1016
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:07,673
That's not a rescue mission.

1017
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:09,925
Come on.

1018
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,685
I thought you said there were two seats.

1019
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:22,312
No, two pods! You take this one
and I'll jump in the other one.

1020
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:24,106
- Where's the other one?
- We don't have time for this, okay?

1021
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,565
Just get in.

1022
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:33,031
- You are going in the other pod, right?
- I'll be right behind you, don't worry.

1023
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:34,491
Promise me.

1024
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,536
Yeah, okay, I promise.

1025
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,588
What is your first name?

1026
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:52,259
I'll tell you when we get there.
I'll race you down.

1027
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:54,594
I'll buy you an ice cream.

1028
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:19,911
Sir? We have pod launch on M.S. One.

1029
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:24,124
What do you know!
Your deadbeat friend did it.

1030
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:33,133
This your idea of keeping a promise?

1031
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,052
What the hell is wrong with you?
Why'd you get out of the pod?

1032
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,429
I realized I might be the only thing
keeping the hostages alive.

1033
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:39,347
Really? How do you figure that?

1034
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:42,267
My father won't authorize an attack
with me still here.

1035
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,852
Have you actually met your father?

1036
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:47,064
- Don't start that. We have to help them.
- Look, I can't, okay?

1037
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:49,649
I would love to, but I can't.

1038
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:53,653
Mace told me where the case is.

1039
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,992
- Bullshit.
- It was the last thing he said.

1040
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:04,581
Really?

1041
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:06,917
So where is it?

1042
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,710
You help me, I help you.

1043
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,087
Come on!

1044
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,631
Or are you all mouth, no trousers?

1045
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:19,012
Fine. You'll believe what you want.

1046
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:23,517
I wasn't going to tell you, but your
standards of sainthood crap won me over.

1047
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,940
Okay, wait. Wait.

1048
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,819
I'm a lot of trousers, okay?

1049
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:35,987
<i>Smiler!</i>

1050
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:37,364
There's been a change of plan.

1051
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:40,617
<i>We're going to have
a sing-song instead. Okay?</i>

1052
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,993
<i>All right, then.</i>

1053
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:43,286
<i>Come back to me.</i>

1054
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:46,206
<i>My sweet, my little Emilie</i>

1055
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:47,374
God.

1056
01:08:47,499 --> 01:08:49,709
I've not told you the plan, man.
I didn't tell you the plan.

1057
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:53,171
<i>For every three seconds you're not here,
I'm gonna kill a man.</i>

1058
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:54,464
<i>Do you understand me now?</i>

1059
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:55,549
<i>So...</i>

1060
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:59,427
<i>Come back to me, my sweet,
my little Emilie.</i>

1061
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:00,929
<i>Where have you gone?</i>

1062
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,889
<i>- Stop!
- Tell me where you are</i>

1063
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:03,974
<i>or I kill another one.</i>

1064
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,058
- Please stop!
- Emilie.

1065
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:07,435
<i>Hello, sweetheart.
I can hear you're upset there.</i>

1066
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:10,105
<i>I'm bloody upset as well.
I'm sweating like a pig here.</i>

1067
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,107
Just stop. I'll do anything you want.

1068
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,109
<i>Well, now, you're being silly.</i>

1069
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:16,611
<i>I think you're being silly now.
Let me come and get you.</i>

1070
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,822
<i>Tell me where you are and don't lie. Ever.</i>

1071
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,908
Emilie, don't.

1072
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,955
Stop killing people.

1073
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:30,876
<i>You tell me the truth now
and I'll stop shooting your friends. Okay?</i>

1074
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:33,920
Level three.

1075
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,589
<i>Thank you.</i>

1076
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,551
No! God!

1077
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:41,219
No!

1078
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:44,723
Is anybody hiding?

1079
01:09:44,806 --> 01:09:46,725
'Cause I'll find you!

1080
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:50,770
<i>It's left.</i>

1081
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,457
He was gonna kill them all anyway.

1082
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:12,667
I don't really know where the case is.

1083
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:18,256
I just needed you to help me.

1084
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,494
Okay.

1085
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:20,986
Yeah.

1086
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:25,115
This is what I was afraid of.

1087
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:27,200
They've been using the prisoners
as guinea pigs.

1088
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:29,995
Yeah, looks like your hostage buddies
are not exactly the innocent victims

1089
01:11:30,078 --> 01:11:31,371
you thought they were, huh?

1090
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:34,124
Liars everywhere these days it seems.

1091
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:36,918
Don't move.

1092
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,129
God, I hate that.

1093
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:43,800
Hello, you two.

1094
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:30,221
Do you know what you've done?

1095
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:37,437
Turn on the comms.

1096
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:44,277
Sir, comms are live.

1097
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,112
All channels.

1098
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:49,366
Snowfall? This is Home fire.

1099
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:50,784
<i>Come in.</i>

1100
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,997
<i>Snowfall, this is Home fire.</i>

1101
01:12:56,081 --> 01:12:57,290
<i>Come in.</i>

1102
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,459
Can we make this a secure channel, please?

1103
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:03,254
- Snow? Snow, are you there?
- Harry, is that you?

1104
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:07,467
Yeah, man. Live and direct.
For one night only. You?

1105
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:10,053
Yeah. Put me on the guest list.

1106
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:14,057
<i>Did we manage to make contact
with our friend?</i>

1107
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,308
Affirmative.

1108
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,268
And what about the thing that you lost?

1109
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:20,480
- Did our friend come through for us?
- Negative, Harry.

1110
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:25,235
Okay, don't sweat it. Look,
things have kind of gone sideways here.

1111
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:27,570
<i>- You gotta get out.
- I didn't get the girl.</i>

1112
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:29,489
<i>- Ain't that the story of your life?
- Yeah.</i>

1113
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:32,283
<i>From what I'm reading on her vitals here,
it don't look good.</i>

1114
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:35,328
There's no way for you to get back to her
even if she's not already dead.

1115
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:38,415
<i>M. S. One is falling out of the sky, Snow.
You gotta get out.</i>

1116
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:40,208
<i>- Okay.
- Get to dock 9.</i>

1117
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:42,293
<i>There's an ORAM engineering suit there.</i>

1118
01:13:42,377 --> 01:13:44,003
<i>Put it on and get outside.</i>

1119
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:45,296
You'll need to float around a bit,

1120
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,924
but I'm sending someone by to pick you up.
Okay?

1121
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,551
I think I'm just gonna
lie here for a while,

1122
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,970
<i>- and see if it all goes away.
- No.</i>

1123
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:54,931
All right.

1124
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:02,021
The M.S. One is destabilized.

1125
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:05,525
<i>Let us on board, or we'll
be forced to attack.</i>

1126
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,367
Now. You want to save your skin?

1127
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:19,038
Tell your daddy to call off the assault.

1128
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:23,668
Or I will set my brother onto you.

1129
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:42,812
<i>Dad?</i>

1130
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:46,733
<i>Emilie, I'm here.</i>

1131
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:48,735
<i>Emilie?</i>

1132
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,236
Are you okay?

1133
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,572
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1134
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:56,201
<i>Sweetheart?</i>

1135
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:58,161
Everyone's dead.

1136
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,751
Blow this dump out of the sky.

1137
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:08,796
Well, shit.

1138
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:19,933
You get them back.

1139
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,310
You hear me? You call them off!

1140
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:24,854
Promises are promises, Smiler!

1141
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,274
So be it.

1142
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:38,952
Promises, sweetheart.

1143
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,496
Leave her be.

1144
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,250
That's it, then.

1145
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,293
Sir,

1146
01:15:48,503 --> 01:15:50,255
you need to authorize an assault.

1147
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,881
Emilie's still on the station.

1148
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:56,302
I know this might be difficult, sir,
but she's just one hostage.

1149
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,096
She is my daughter.

1150
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,389
I know that, sir.

1151
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,224
Then you know that I cannot authorize that.

1152
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:02,642
Then I'm sorry, Jeff.

1153
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:04,727
Sorry?

1154
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:07,564
Under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment,

1155
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:10,900
I am temporarily relieving you
of all your duties as the President

1156
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:14,195
of the United States
due to the fact that you are incapable

1157
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:17,824
of placing national security
above personal concerns.

1158
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,868
You can't do that.
You need vice-presidential

1159
01:16:19,869 --> 01:16:21,828
and congressional approval.

1160
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,454
Already signed.

1161
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:26,833
You son of a bitch!

1162
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,543
Thank you, sir.

1163
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,170
Scott! Please.

1164
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:35,842
Don't do this.

1165
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,510
You'll kill her.

1166
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:41,055
Go. Full breach.

1167
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:43,057
Quarterback? This is Home fire.

1168
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:45,685
Dropkick authorized. Full breach.

1169
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:58,323
<i>Moving into assault formation.
Weapons live.</i>

1170
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:04,829
Oh, shit!

1171
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:07,206
You said that was your promise to me!

1172
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:08,708
Quiet, we can salvage this.

1173
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:09,959
Shut up for a second!

1174
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:12,211
- You said that was a promise to me, man.
- Not now.

1175
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,505
You choose him over me.
You leave me behind.

1176
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:17,175
We've a serious problem
and you're shouting about this?

1177
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:18,926
You made me look stupid.

1178
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,137
Every time I dig us out...

1179
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,690
Mommy said you speak too much.

1180
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,360
Who's gonna look after you now?

1181
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:40,698
Families!

1182
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:43,868
Hey, now then, where were we, Smiler?

1183
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,876
<i>Target will be throwing live rounds.</i>

1184
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:55,880
<i>Watch out, the defense
system is still active.</i>

1185
01:18:01,511 --> 01:18:02,762
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

1186
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,848
<i>Number 5, do you read me?</i>

1187
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:12,563
<i>We're taking fire. We're taking fire.</i>

1188
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,612
Come here. Come here!

1189
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:27,995
Bitch!

1190
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:42,802
You're back.

1191
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:45,471
Yeah, well, I wasn't busy.

1192
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:48,057
We should go.

1193
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,398
<i>All right,
you need to move down 4.5 degrees.</i>

1194
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:58,818
<i>6 o'clock, all units, 6 o'clock.</i>

1195
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:00,862
<i>Coming in low.</i>

1196
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,252
<i>Units two and three, I'm at your left.</i>

1197
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:19,005
<i>Units two and three, 9 o'clock, 9 o'clock.</i>

1198
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,218
<i>Taking fire, taking fire,
unit 11, taking fire.</i>

1199
01:19:24,302 --> 01:19:25,303
Second bomber down.

1200
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:27,096
<i>We got one more to go.</i>

1201
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:30,016
<i>Unit nine. We're on our way.</i>

1202
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:32,226
<i>Unit nine, unit nine.</i>

1203
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,440
<i>We're going in, unit 11 .</i>

1204
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:39,859
<i>Go for the tunnel.</i>

1205
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:41,944
<i>Unit 17, he's on your tail.</i>

1206
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,362
<i>Turn, turn!</i>

1207
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:44,906
<i>We have you going for the hole, gentlemen.</i>

1208
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,284
Take a right!

1209
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,378
Okay. Now put that thing on.

1210
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:01,881
<i>Fifty feet ahead, then right. Almost there.</i>

1211
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:04,050
<i>- Unit eight, 50 feet!
- Under the gun!</i>

1212
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,802
<i>Twenty-yard line! Drop the baby.</i>

1213
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:08,513
<i>Baby dropped. Confirming, confirming.</i>

1214
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:10,431
<i>Touchdown! Let's go!</i>

1215
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:13,267
<i>All units evac. All units evac.</i>

1216
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:27,907
Snow, every second counts here, man.

1217
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:29,575
<i>Get outside.</i>

1218
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,127
I gotta tell you something.

1219
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,880
I really hate heights.

1220
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,197
Emilie!

1221
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:15,246
Emilie!

1222
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:59,248
Emilie. Come on. Emilie.

1223
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:07,632
Come on, buddy. Get up!

1224
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:08,883
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1225
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,322
The briefcase. The train station.

1226
01:23:13,406 --> 01:23:14,407
I threw you the case.

1227
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:17,576
Where'd you put it?

1228
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:21,706
<i>Where'd you put it? Mace?
You remember the package?</i>

1229
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:26,293
<i>In the train station.</i>

1230
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:28,796
<i>True blue, Union... Union...</i>

1231
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:31,424
<i>True blue, Union... No.</i>

1232
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,219
<i>True blue. Union stew.</i>

1233
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:38,097
Some people just unravel.

1234
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:41,726
<i>Now you're asking a crazy man
where he hid a briefcase.</i>

1235
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:43,269
<i>Green. Beans.</i>

1236
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,646
<i>- Mace?</i>
- Lock, lockers, locker.

1237
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:48,065
<i>Green. Green gloppy, stocker, stocker.</i>

1238
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:49,900
- Mace. Mace.
- Yeah.

1239
01:23:49,984 --> 01:23:50,985
<i>Remember the case?</i>

1240
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,154
<i>Where 'd you put it?
I threw it to you on the train.</i>

1241
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:54,280
Case.

1242
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:56,115
<i>- Where'd you put it?
- Green.</i>

1243
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:58,325
<i>Well, locked, clock.</i>

1244
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:00,870
Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby.

1245
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:03,330
<i>Green, gloppy, lullaby)'.</i>

1246
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:05,416
<i>What briefcase?</i>

1247
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:11,047
I see you.

1248
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:12,965
I see you.

1249
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:15,217
I foresee you.

1250
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,386
<i>I foresee you.</i>

1251
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,055
<i>I see you.</i>

1252
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:20,598
<i>I foresee you.</i>

1253
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,319
<i>What happened in that room?</i>

1254
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:42,411
What happened in that room?

1255
01:24:44,205 --> 01:24:46,749
- That's not what happened.
- I saw it with my own eyes.

1256
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:49,210
<i>Running out of jokes, are we?</i>

1257
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:52,963
<i>That's not what happened.</i>

1258
01:25:04,642 --> 01:25:06,685
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

1259
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,194
There's something that we need to do.

1260
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:27,373
- Thanks, Charlie.
- Hey, buddy.

1261
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:29,500
How you doing?

1262
01:25:30,376 --> 01:25:31,710
I'm good.

1263
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:35,005
How's the girl?

1264
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,801
As far as they'll tell me she's fine.
You did a good job.

1265
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:41,804
Sorry about Mace.

1266
01:25:42,388 --> 01:25:45,057
And that you didn't get
the thing you needed.

1267
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:46,308
No, no, I got it.

1268
01:25:46,392 --> 01:25:48,686
No, I mean the briefcase.

1269
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:51,313
Yeah. Yeah, I got the briefcase.

1270
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:52,898
- You got the briefcase?
- Yeah.

1271
01:25:52,982 --> 01:25:54,608
- I thought that you...
- No, it's here.

1272
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:57,194
- The case is here?
- Yeah. You want to see it?

1273
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,906
- Yeah.
- Charlie? Can you grab it?

1274
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:04,326
You know Frank was undercover
when he was killed, right?

1275
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,954
He wasn't selling secrets.
He was returning them.

1276
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:08,164
Yeah.

1277
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,173
I don't understand.

1278
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:21,635
What I don't understand is
how you knew the combination.

1279
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:24,054
That's what I don't understand.

1280
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:34,273
Right.

1281
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:39,612
Well...

1282
01:26:41,322 --> 01:26:43,657
Well, this is awkward.

1283
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:50,289
- They pay you well?
- Matter of fact, they did.

1284
01:26:50,456 --> 01:26:52,750
No, they really did.

1285
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,377
How much was that exactly?
How much was Frank's life worth?

1286
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:56,962
Does the number even matter, Snow?

1287
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:59,381
I hope they put you away for a long time.

1288
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,760
You know, I don't think they will.

1289
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,535
You of all people know
that they like to keep

1290
01:27:06,536 --> 01:27:08,766
all these kind of
things on the down-low.

1291
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:12,061
My guess, I'll do three years
tops at minimum security,

1292
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:13,145
and you want to know why?

1293
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:16,899
Because they need people like me.

1294
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:20,486
I know all of their dirty little secrets.
Ain't that right?

1295
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:26,325
I am sorry about Frank,

1296
01:27:27,076 --> 01:27:28,702
but in the big scheme of things,

1297
01:27:28,786 --> 01:27:32,414
he'll go down as an innocent bystander.
He won't even make the balance sheet.

1298
01:27:32,498 --> 01:27:34,500
Just like you. Because he's a relic.

1299
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:37,878
I mean, God, look at you.
Nobody smokes any more, Snow!

1300
01:27:37,962 --> 01:27:40,547
You know,
for all your bluster and your bullshit,

1301
01:27:40,631 --> 01:27:42,091
you're nothing but cannon-fodder.

1302
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:44,093
You're cannon-fodder
and they don't need you

1303
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,095
like they need me, okay?

1304
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:50,224
<i>Lgnem feram.</i>

1305
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:57,773
That was from Frank.

1306
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:05,864
So,

1307
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:09,618
all this trouble for an empty briefcase.

1308
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:12,788
Don't let it keep you up at night.
Thanks, Charlie.

1309
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:14,331
Hey, Snow!

1310
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:16,458
Good job.

1311
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:41,734
Take this,

1312
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,111
don't let them take this.

1313
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,491
Frank.

1314
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,252
What's it gonna be, buddy?

1315
01:29:09,178 --> 01:29:11,305
I know something about you.

1316
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:15,809
Amazing what you can find out
as First Daughter in old Army documents.

1317
01:29:15,893 --> 01:29:17,061
Last name, Snow.

1318
01:29:17,144 --> 01:29:18,729
First name,

1319
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:20,230
Marion.

1320
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:23,609
My old man was a big John Wayne fan.

1321
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:26,236
Must have been tough on the playground.

1322
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:29,698
That's why I'm so lovable.

1323
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:33,869
Looks like you're a free man.

1324
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,412
Thanks to you.

1325
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:37,289
What kind of Robin Hood would I be

1326
01:29:37,373 --> 01:29:39,875
if I didn't stop to rescue Maid Marion
once in a while?

1327
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,503
Okay, you can stop that. Snow's just fine.

1328
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:45,047
No, I'm getting used to Marion.
I really like it.

1329
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:47,091
Makes me see your feminine side.

1330
01:29:47,174 --> 01:29:48,634
- Great.
- I've got something for you.

1331
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:54,223
What the hell was that for?

1332
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:55,891
I owed you that.

1333
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:59,520
I really feel we need to continue this
on an equitable basis.

1334
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:02,815
You know, for a minute there,
I thought you were going to kiss me.

1335
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:13,826
Where's the entourage?

1336
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:15,411
Gave them the slip.

1337
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:18,247
- Have you to thank for teaching me that.
- Nice work.

1338
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:20,249
You're still bleeding, Marion.

1339
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:21,917
And you wonder
why I didn't tell you my first name?

1340
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,711
All right, how about "Sally"?
It has a nice ring to it.

1341
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:26,755
Yes, it does, but I prefer Snow.

1342
01:30:26,839 --> 01:30:29,425
I can't call you that.
It sounds like an ice cream.

1343
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:31,927
Speaking of which, I
believe you owe me one.

1344
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:36,473
You know, I've got this feeling your old
man's not going to approve of this.

1345
01:30:36,557 --> 01:30:38,434
I mean, I can't really see this
going anywhere, can you?

1346
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:40,519
Depends on how good you are in bed.

1347
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,563
Well, in that case,
I give it at least 10 minutes.
