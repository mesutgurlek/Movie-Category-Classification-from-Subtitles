1
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:15,905
Bobby.

2
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:17,945
Bobby.

3
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:19,905
No!

4
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:43,389
All right, we lined up?

5
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:45,628
Get that line.

6
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:55,635
Put the stern line on quick.

7
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,189
Bobby!

8
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,829
Hey, baby!

9
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:33,385
Missed you.

10
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:40,752
Hey, big man, how you doing?

11
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:49,786
-Hey, Murph!
-Hey, Ethel.

12
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:51,834
How you doing? Welcome home.

13
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:54,106
-You seen Deb and my boy?
-No, I'm sorry.

14
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:55,345
Ma!

15
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:59,791
-How you doing, beautiful?
-Hello, Bobby.

16
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,355
Home safe.

17
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:11,631
Who's that?

18
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:15,067
-Ol' Ben.
-No.

19
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,429
Poor old guy.

20
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:19,791
Hey, Linda.

21
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,667
-Hey, boss.
-What's the score?

22
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:26,911
My kind of numbers.

23
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:29,425
I lost Ben Pulley.
He passed away onboard.

24
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:33,348
Sorry to hear that.

25
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:35,115
How'd you hit it, Billy?

26
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:39,388
Didn't hit very hard, did you?

27
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:42,429
We all have slumps, but you're overdue
to break out of yours.

28
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:44,945
Did you hear the lady?
Ben Pulley's dead.

29
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:49,388
That old man pickled himself to death
drinking 7&7s chasing Narragansetts.

30
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:53,635
Linda, with Ben, it was never
a question of "if," but "when. "

31
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:56,073
-I'll bury him.
-I'll pay for it.

32
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:57,915
See, you got what you wanted.

33
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:01,513
Bring in your fish.
It shouldn't take too long.

34
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:23,594
8-5.

35
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:30,915
4-7-5.

36
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:52,505
Murph.

37
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,949
Sign my ledger.

38
00:07:57,796 --> 00:07:58,945
Shatford.

39
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,389
Sign my ledger.

40
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:07,585
What's the matter?

41
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:09,593
It's $2221 .
Aren't we a little short?

42
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:15,189
We were sharing up last night.
I thought it'd be three plus.

43
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:22,507
You stocked 21 ,000 pounds at 3.50
a pound. That comes to $73,000.

44
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:27,193
Minus $35,000 for bait, tackle, fuel.
That comes out to $38,500.

45
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:28,949
I get half. I own the boat.

46
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:31,829
Your captain takes double share,
four crewmen get a share each.

47
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:34,596
And a rookie like you,
three-quarters share.

48
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:37,754
That comes to $2221 .

49
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:39,709
What it is, is what it is.

50
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:41,515
Sign the ledger.

51
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,031
Moran.

52
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:55,351
You going out again this season,
skipper?

53
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:56,625
Why?

54
00:08:58,036 --> 00:08:59,389
You got a site in Florida?

55
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:03,235
Bradenton Beach.

56
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:05,595
The Cecile.

57
00:09:06,956 --> 00:09:08,787
Pack your shit and get out.

58
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:11,795
You like Florida?

59
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,344
Well, it beats the Grand Banks
in October.

60
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:19,073
It gets rough up here,
Dougie likes the sun down there.

61
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,112
Or he thinks he'll score better
with another captain.

62
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:23,511
I didn't say that.

63
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:25,429
Yes, you did.

64
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:28,071
Goodbye.

65
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:33,866
Here's your cut. $5923.76.
Sign the ledger.

66
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:37,032
That's a record low for you,
isn't it?

67
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,593
Next time, track Linda.
She'll take you where the fish are.

68
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:43,626
You're getting to be rude, you know?

69
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,305
I like you, Billy.
I always have.

70
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:47,915
But I like my boat better.

71
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:51,074
If you can't make it pay,
I'll find somebody who can.

72
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,353
You trying to put a charge up my ass?

73
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:55,994
You're on a cold streak.

74
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,993
I'm encouraging you
to catch fish.

75
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,505
I'll bring you more fish
than you ever dreamed of.

76
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:03,355
Next time I fish the Grand Banks,
they won't be so grand.

77
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:05,387
You Just struck out
on the Grand Banks.

78
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:06,665
Then I'll go further.

79
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:11,350
Don't even think about it.
I want my boat back.

80
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:13,353
And I want to catch some fish.

81
00:10:13,556 --> 00:10:14,511
It's what I do.

82
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,111
Not lately.

83
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:18,586
Want to yank my site, you go ahead.

84
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:39,865
-Murph.
-Hey, skip.

85
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:44,629
What are you doing out here?
Get in there. Get drunk.

86
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:46,914
Waiting on my ex. . .

87
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:48,704
. . .and my son.

88
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:55,550
Give him lots of
hugs and kisses tonight.

89
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:59,075
You don't gotta remind me
to do that, skip.

90
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:04,866
Ladies, you're looking fine.
How you doing?

91
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:07,510
Can I buy you a drink?
What, what, what?

92
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:15,469
Hey, rookie.

93
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,989
What are you so happy about?

94
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:23,068
It wasn't exactly a slammer
up on the Grand Banks.

95
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:24,868
Isn't it past your bedtime?

96
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:28,348
Bugs, how you making out?

97
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:29,830
I'm not.

98
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:34,265
I don't know.
Maybe I smell like fish.

99
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:37,667
-You need a new deodorant.
-Maybe I need a new face.

100
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:42,826
Frickin' Alfred Pierre.

101
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:47,784
They were upstairs, they come down,
a little refreshment.

102
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:49,793
Now they're going back up again.

103
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:52,556
Half an hour ago, they shook
the lamps over the bar.

104
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:56,385
Last time she brought her sister.
You should've seen the lamps then.

105
00:11:58,236 --> 00:11:59,988
How do he do it, mon?

106
00:12:00,196 --> 00:12:02,915
I think he's fishin'
with a longer pole, Bugs.

107
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:14,591
What happened?

108
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:18,709
They had a sale on kids' shoes
at Ames.

109
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,031
Sorry.

110
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:22,715
No problem.

111
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:24,432
Hi.

112
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:26,270
Hello.

113
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:30,754
So you want to have a drink?

114
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:34,431
Come on, Debra.

115
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:36,513
What do you say, for old times' sake?

116
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:38,786
It was the old times that killed us.

117
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:42,630
Is that what it was?

118
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:47,344
There you go.

119
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:50,470
I'm a little short.
It wasn't exactly a slammer.

120
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,351
Half for you.

121
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,266
You sure?

122
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:56,551
Yeah, I'm working.

123
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,435
Want to come with your daddy?

124
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:06,675
Shoot some pool?

125
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,429
Have a drink?

126
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:18,027
Just bring him home in an hour.

127
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,388
Good shot, buddy.

128
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:41,144
All right, Sully, you think about it.

129
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:42,465
All right?

130
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:47,189
Bugs.

131
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:50,504
Murph, come here.

132
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:53,435
Here comes your fearless leader,
Captain Billy Tyne.

133
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:56,389
I got a feeling skipper's
coming to give us bad news.

134
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:00,185
Lady's not only pretty, she's smart.

135
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,754
Yeah, we're going back out.

136
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:05,795
What'd I tell you?

137
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:09,387
-When?
-A few days.

138
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:10,745
"Few" means two?

139
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:12,265
Two days is right.

140
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,074
Skip, we Just got back in.

141
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:16,790
You don't want your site,
a replacement's a call away.

142
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:21,991
Join me, don't Join me.

143
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:24,996
There's time for one last shot.
The Andrea Gail will take it.

144
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:28,632
This time I promise you, we'll
come back with a shitload of fish.

145
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,674
Excuse me, men, madam.

146
00:14:36,396 --> 00:14:37,624
What are you gonna do?

147
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:40,994
I'm gonna tell him to
stick his head up his ass.

148
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:42,555
I'd like to hear that.

149
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:44,431
Hear what?

150
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:47,070
I'd like to hear you tell him
to stick it up his ass.

151
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,504
Go on, Bob.

152
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:56,631
Yeah, that's Just how I'll tell him
as soon as we get back.

153
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:58,349
You're a bastard.

154
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,066
Why? Why do I even love you?

155
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,948
-Come on.
-No. Why? Why, Bobby?

156
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:06,274
When you get the answer, tell me.
I could use it myself.

157
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:09,355
-Get laid, Bugsy.
-Easy for you to say.

158
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:19,510
Go on up there.

159
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:21,434
Don't make the same mistake I did.

160
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:33,067
You're going away again?

161
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:36,584
Yeah.

162
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:39,112
Take me with you.

163
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,144
Come here.

164
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:48,391
Go back, Bobby.

165
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:51,751
Go back to what you did before.

166
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,868
-Pack cod, repair tackle.
-I'm sick of that.

167
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:56,835
It's safe and it pays.

168
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:58,910
Not enough.

169
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:01,512
Just one more time. I promise.

170
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:04,390
I have to try it again.
We need the money, baby.

171
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,064
Money. It's always about the money.

172
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:11,869
Well, I got a divorce lawyer,
a mountain of debt.

173
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:16,632
And there's your two kids.
You gotta get them back.

174
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:20,588
Do you think you'll love them?

175
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,588
They're yours, aren't they?

176
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:43,075
Hey, beautiful.

177
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:44,465
Yeah, you.

178
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:46,989
Buy you a drink?

179
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:50,710
Seeing as I got two in front of me,
I don't think so.

180
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,507
I'm not very observant, am l?

181
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:57,907
I got a feeling, yeah,
along with a lot of other things.

182
00:16:58,116 --> 00:16:59,788
Why don't we start over?

183
00:17:00,996 --> 00:17:03,988
You know what would look good on you?
Me.

184
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:08,184
No good?

185
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:14,266
Have a drink. It's not that bad.

186
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:18,667
Thank you. Here's to crime.

187
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,468
You're pathetic.

188
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:31,274
You still want to be a fisherman?

189
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,950
Who told you I wanted to be
a fisherman?

190
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:35,675
You want to come with me.

191
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:39,152
I want to come with you,
but I don't want to be a fisherman.

192
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:45,394
You know, buddy. . .

193
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:51,032
. . .one of these days your mom's
gonna find you a new dad.

194
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,352
I don't want a new dad.

195
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:54,671
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,549
Your mom can't sit around
by herself all the time.

197
00:17:58,116 --> 00:17:59,947
She isn't sitting around.

198
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:18,427
I'm sure he's a good guy.

199
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,792
I know your mom wouldn't take up
with anybody but a good guy.

200
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,995
And you know, buddy. . .

201
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:31,793
. . .the most important thing is
that you and Mommy are happy.

202
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:36,034
Can we talk about something else now?

203
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:49,146
I miss you too, buddy.

204
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:57,385
I miss you so damn much.

205
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:01,709
What'd you say your name was again?

206
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:04,192
Irene. Is that so tough?

207
00:19:04,396 --> 00:19:05,988
I'm sorry. Listen.

208
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,392
Could I maybe take you home?

209
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:11,266
I don't think so.

210
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:16,435
I came to watch the game. Instead I
got schnockered with Bugsy.

211
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:20,715
-What does Bugsy stand for anyway?
-Michael.

212
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:23,631
That's a nice name.
Why don't you use it?

213
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:25,628
Because people know me as Bugsy.

214
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:30,465
I'm gonna shove off now.
Big day tomorrow.

215
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:33,110
I can't take you home?

216
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:34,914
What, in a wheelbarrow?

217
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:36,947
Crew guys like you never have cars.

218
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,670
Lay off. I got feelings too.

219
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:42,709
Where, down in your pants?

220
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,953
Jesus, lady, where's the passion
in your life?

221
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:49,112
Home in bed.

222
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,671
One of them's 6, the other one's 8.

223
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:56,273
All I can say is,
there's some lucky kids.

224
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:58,389
They got a wonderful mother.

225
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,872
You're not messing with me, are you?

226
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,146
Haven't got time.
We're going out in two days.

227
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:13,986
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Michael.

228
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:16,795
Gotta go.

229
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:19,750
What do you mean?

230
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:23,468
-Where you going?
-Have these.

231
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:25,234
-Thank you.
-See you.

232
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:31,032
-Bye, Ethel.
-See you.

233
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:49,385
Watch your step.

234
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:00,788
I smell Coppertone.

235
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:02,873
That means that
Captain Linda Greenlaw. . .

236
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:06,193
. . .a lady vain about her nose,
is in my wheelhouse.

237
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:07,710
Make that Hawaiian Tropic.

238
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,907
At least I got the nose right.

239
00:21:10,996 --> 00:21:13,590
Your guys are loading bait
and groceries.

240
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:17,469
-You doing a turnaround?
-No rest for the weary.

241
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,826
There you go.
Flaunting your work ethic.

242
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:22,226
I don't have a work ethic.
I Just have work.

243
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:24,228
If I'm gonna catch up to you.

244
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:26,948
I love to watch you study charts.

245
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:28,430
Why?

246
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,269
You know them all by heart.

247
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:33,995
What's special about today
that you're blowing smoke up my ass?

248
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:35,470
I thought I'd make a pass.

249
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:42,706
You see, I'm looking for a guy
to come home to Maine with me. . .

250
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,349
. . .buy a house and raise kids.

251
00:21:44,556 --> 00:21:46,387
What does that guy and you do after?

252
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:50,953
The thing is, I'm happy.
I'm happy I'm fit to do this.

253
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:53,192
I Just don't see the romance in it.

254
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:56,189
But you've got it, Captain Greenlaw.

255
00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:58,274
You do. Believe me.

256
00:21:58,476 --> 00:22:00,148
I've seen them come and go.

257
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:03,706
The day I laid eyes on you, I said,
"She's gonna be a good one. "

258
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,108
You can't be good unless you love it.

259
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:10,268
The fog's Just lifting.

260
00:22:11,636 --> 00:22:14,025
You throw off your bow line,
throw off your stern.

261
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:17,393
You head out the South Channel. . .

262
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:20,713
. . .past Rocky Neck,
Ten Pound lsland. . .

263
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:24,673
. . .past Niles Pond,
where I skated as a kid.

264
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:26,511
Blow your horn. . .

265
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:29,674
. . .and wave to the lighthouse
keeper's kid on Thatcher lsland.

266
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:32,035
Then the birds show up.

267
00:22:32,236 --> 00:22:33,749
Black-backs. . .

268
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:36,794
. . .herring gulls, big dump ducks.

269
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:39,955
The sun hits you.

270
00:22:40,156 --> 00:22:42,750
Head north, open up to 1 2.

271
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:44,785
You're steaming now.

272
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:48,474
The guys are busy,
you're in charge.

273
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:52,867
You know what?
You're a goddamn swordboat captain.

274
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,992
Is there anything better in the world?

275
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:11,871
Sully.

276
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:16,708
So what do you think?

277
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:21,945
You been busy?

278
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:23,509
Busy enough.

279
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:26,276
I was working menhaden in Annisquam.

280
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,547
But they laid off Labor Day.

281
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,674
Mended nets over in Fairhaven.

282
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,595
That's crap.
What's this you're doing now?

283
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,190
Helping out a friend.

284
00:23:36,436 --> 00:23:37,789
He paying you?

285
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:39,869
He's my friend.

286
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:45,595
Murphy keep his site?

287
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:50,874
You want this Job or not?

288
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:53,870
I do.

289
00:24:56,836 --> 00:24:59,634
Lord, did I do that?

290
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:03,429
Yeah, you did.

291
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:08,151
But I'm not completely blind.
I can still see out of the other one.

292
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:10,550
Next time I should break a leg.

293
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:13,350
Then you can stay home
and collect disability.

294
00:25:13,716 --> 00:25:16,435
Think of all those
handicapped parking spaces.

295
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:21,752
Tell me last night was worth it.

296
00:25:22,436 --> 00:25:24,074
I can't remember.

297
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:27,150
Can't remember, my ass.

298
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:29,666
No, I remember your ass.

299
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:33,553
Last night was worth it.

300
00:25:34,556 --> 00:25:36,035
There's nothing like
sleeping with you.

301
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,109
Just sleeping. . .

302
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:41,148
. . .Iying next to you. . .

303
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,828
. . .all warm and sweet.

304
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:47,070
And me wishing the morning
would never come.

305
00:25:56,676 --> 00:25:58,155
Catching up.

306
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:06,148
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Look at that shiner.

307
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:07,749
Come on, Murph, will you?

308
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,227
Good morning.
Where'd you get the mouse?

309
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:13,273
Chris "Boom-Boom" Cotter.

310
00:26:15,836 --> 00:26:18,634
Put some hair around that hole,
I bet you could hit it.

311
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:23,231
Not with a pool cue,
or any other pointed instrument.

312
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:29,265
What do you know except to cut squid
and take them to bed with you?

313
00:26:31,476 --> 00:26:34,036
Ethel, where you getting
your customers these days?

314
00:26:34,236 --> 00:26:35,749
The welfare office?

315
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:38,626
Who gave you that scar, tough guy?

316
00:26:39,476 --> 00:26:41,228
Back off! Back off.

317
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:42,551
Come on, swing it.

318
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:44,229
You assholes!

319
00:26:46,476 --> 00:26:50,515
How you gonna act onboard if you're
already at each other's throats?

320
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:51,705
All right, Ma.

321
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:55,354
See you onboard.

322
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:02,868
-Alfred Pierre, one for the road?
-No, tanks, Mom.

323
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:06,513
"No, tanks, Mom. "
Guy can't even speak good English.

324
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:08,752
Well, anyway, can I get you anything?

325
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:10,230
Let's go, boys.

326
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:14,271
I'll wait for you in the car, Bobby.

327
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:18,914
Catch fish, boys. Lots of them.
Full ahead.

328
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:21,107
Hold down the fort, Quentin.

329
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:22,584
Thanks, Q.

330
00:27:23,156 --> 00:27:24,225
Thanks, Ethel.

331
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:29,435
Gotta go, Mom.

332
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:33,548
The Grand Banks.

333
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:35,384
I know.

334
00:27:35,596 --> 00:27:38,713
Grand Banks are no Joke in October.
All right?

335
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,190
Be careful.

336
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:22,586
At least we'll get cancer together.

337
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:29,946
I can't put it off any longer.

338
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:32,792
I'm not too big on goodbyes.

339
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:38,911
Don't go, Bobby. I got a bad feeling.

340
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:41,909
I've been thinking about it.

341
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,831
Then for God's sake, don't go.

342
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:46,867
I'll moonlight, I'll sell the car.

343
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:49,032
We'll work nights, weekends.

344
00:28:49,236 --> 00:28:52,592
Whatever it takes, little by little,
we'll put something away.

345
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,035
I gotta go.

346
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:09,950
Michael.

347
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:27,186
Irene.

348
00:29:27,436 --> 00:29:29,233
Irene. I knew that.

349
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:34,993
I Just wanted to say goodbye.

350
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:38,671
No one ever said goodbye to me before.

351
00:29:45,156 --> 00:29:46,384
Well, goodbye, lrene.

352
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:47,666
Goodbye.

353
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:50,344
I wish it were night so I could say,
"Good night, lrene. "

354
00:29:53,476 --> 00:29:54,750
That'll come later.

355
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:00,230
Well, you gotta go.

356
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:02,873
Come on, boys. Let's go.

357
00:30:15,236 --> 00:30:16,555
I love you.

358
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:19,427
I will always love you, Christina.

359
00:31:55,236 --> 00:31:58,114
Pack it in there good.
We got more coming down.

360
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:00,587
Did we get all them eggs up there?

361
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:13,507
We catching some fish

362
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:16,514
Is that gonna crap out again?

363
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:17,910
Never!

364
00:32:53,996 --> 00:32:55,224
Do you mind?

365
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,992
Stinks in here, doesn't it?

366
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:03,388
Not anymore.

367
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:17,953
Hi, Bobby:
You're somewhere out there...

368
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,194
...on the deep blue, goddamn sea...

369
00:33:21,796 --> 00:33:25,391
...and I'm writing this on a box
of two semi-down pillows...

370
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:28,190
... that I secretly bought for us
at Penney's.

371
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:31,192
And I'm smiling to myself because...

372
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:33,711
...of the surprise I have
in store for you.

373
00:33:34,436 --> 00:33:38,827
I'm talking removal from our dungeon
in the Crow's Nest...

374
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:41,746
... to our own place.

375
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,512
It's no great shakes...

376
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:48,628
...but you gotta begin
with a baby shake, right+?

377
00:33:51,036 --> 00:33:52,833
Forever love, Bobby.

378
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:55,586
I'm in this for the long run.

379
00:34:00,196 --> 00:34:03,154
-I'm not intruding, am l?
-You're not intruding.

380
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:05,149
You're a natural.

381
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:07,427
You've got some old salt
in your blood.

382
00:34:07,636 --> 00:34:08,705
Thanks.

383
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:13,670
You're a happy man out here,
aren't you?

384
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:15,229
Today, maybe.

385
00:34:15,956 --> 00:34:17,389
When do you get unhappy?

386
00:34:17,716 --> 00:34:19,149
The day we go home.

387
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:21,871
Home? I thought the sea
was your home.

388
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:25,625
You got me there.

389
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:30,345
But if you were gonna pin me down. . .

390
00:34:31,796 --> 00:34:34,913
. . .I guess Pensacola, Florida is home.

391
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,868
My ex lives there. Jodi.

392
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,589
And my kids.

393
00:34:40,756 --> 00:34:44,635
I wasn't very good at doing things
the way they're supposed to be done.

394
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:45,985
Wife.

395
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:48,150
Kids.

396
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:50,433
A house with things in it.
All that stuff.

397
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:52,509
So why are you so happy?

398
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:55,433
You Just got me on a good day.

399
00:34:56,116 --> 00:34:58,232
I'm doing what I was made to do.

400
00:34:58,956 --> 00:35:01,516
And I got a feeling I'll do it
even better this time.

401
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:04,505
How about you?

402
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:08,950
I got a woman I can't stand to be
more than two feet away from.

403
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:10,914
Congratulations.

404
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,393
Then again, I love to fish.

405
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,788
Son, you've got a problem.

406
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:23,504
I know.

407
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:39,831
Here you are.

408
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:51,625
What do you think? Blue skies,
scattered showers, same old, same old?

409
00:35:51,836 --> 00:35:53,747
-Your guess is as good as mine.
-Or better.

410
00:35:53,956 --> 00:35:55,230
Watch it.

411
00:35:58,276 --> 00:36:00,028
This doesn't look good.

412
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:07,828
Looks pretty ugly here too.

413
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:09,871
Pam.

414
00:36:11,276 --> 00:36:14,586
Tell Bernie I need two graphics:
Bermuda and Sable lsland.

415
00:36:32,996 --> 00:36:34,270
Good.

416
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:36,795
What's our course?

417
00:36:36,996 --> 00:36:40,033
I've been sailing 42 years.
Never plotted a course.

418
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:43,112
I set the compass, I ride it. . .

419
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:45,551
. . .we'll be in Bermuda in no time.

420
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:28,185
Let's go fishing.

421
00:37:29,996 --> 00:37:31,827
All right, guys, let's hit it!

422
00:37:33,156 --> 00:37:37,354
1 000 hooks in the water before dinner.
I want 40 miles out there.

423
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,506
Three-mile buoy out!

424
00:37:46,716 --> 00:37:48,069
Yeah, baby.

425
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:57,671
Set.

426
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:14,748
Okay, Sully, put it out.

427
00:38:16,036 --> 00:38:17,708
Highflyer!

428
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:44,955
Hey, A.P.

429
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:48,110
May the force be with us.

430
00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:50,745
You want to play with lightsticks,
stick them up your ass.

431
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:51,752
Easy, Murph.

432
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:54,675
He's dead weight.
He's been screwing around all night.

433
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:56,195
A Juicer and a head.

434
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:57,630
Cape Ann, bottom shelf.

435
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,430
Yeah, well, your wife
didn't feel that way.

436
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:07,388
Hey, knock it off!

437
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:10,906
I'll head for land and the Newfies
will throw you both in Jail!

438
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:12,629
All right, cap.

439
00:39:13,356 --> 00:39:14,425
Give us some lights.

440
00:39:16,956 --> 00:39:18,275
Come on. Jesus.

441
00:39:18,476 --> 00:39:20,068
Shake, you guys.

442
00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:21,745
Shake!

443
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:34,705
-Just let it go.
-Your day is coming.

444
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:37,589
Whenever you're ready.
I'll be right up here.

445
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:40,509
The Job ain't hard enough
without this knucklehead.

446
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,031
Let's go.

447
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:15,188
We're gonna make some money.

448
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,508
Let's go, boys!

449
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:22,069
Let's go! Come on!

450
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:40,911
Come on.

451
00:41:01,036 --> 00:41:02,628
Do it, skip, do it.

452
00:41:03,476 --> 00:41:04,670
Make a killing.

453
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:07,550
One's on.

454
00:41:07,836 --> 00:41:08,825
Fish on.

455
00:41:13,116 --> 00:41:14,469
Have those gaffs ready.

456
00:41:14,676 --> 00:41:16,985
Don't lose him, Murph.
Don't lose him.

457
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:20,435
Pull him in, Murph.

458
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:28,905
All right, now, gaff him. Gaff him!

459
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,509
One, two, three!

460
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:54,185
Pull him in.

461
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:06,634
Come on, a little bit more.

462
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,268
So what do you think?

463
00:42:14,516 --> 00:42:15,835
Do you think he'll like it?

464
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,674
He'll love it.

465
00:42:19,076 --> 00:42:20,907
Enough to live with me in it?

466
00:42:21,836 --> 00:42:24,953
By now, honey, you know him
much better than I do.

467
00:42:27,476 --> 00:42:28,795
We're gonna make a go of it.

468
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:34,474
I got confidence in you.

469
00:42:36,036 --> 00:42:37,867
What, are you putting me on?

470
00:42:40,676 --> 00:42:42,473
He's my precious boy.

471
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:45,228
And you're the woman for him.

472
00:42:47,756 --> 00:42:49,906
That's something I don't Joke about.

473
00:42:53,596 --> 00:42:56,508
The activity down near Bermuda
is deepening rapidly.

474
00:42:56,716 --> 00:42:58,752
Given the warm and volatile
Gulf Stream...

475
00:42:58,956 --> 00:43:03,393
...it won 't take much to turn
this tropical storm into a hurricane.

476
00:43:03,596 --> 00:43:06,394
This just in, video of Sable lsland.

477
00:43:52,236 --> 00:43:56,115
I put so much ground beef and sausage
in this, it weighed out at 20 pounds.

478
00:43:56,356 --> 00:43:58,074
More than most of our fish weigh.

479
00:43:58,276 --> 00:44:00,073
Skipper say anything about us
coming up short?

480
00:44:00,276 --> 00:44:01,755
He's too scared to say.

481
00:44:01,956 --> 00:44:03,912
Skipper don't get scared.

482
00:44:04,396 --> 00:44:05,545
Just disappointed.

483
00:44:06,636 --> 00:44:08,672
You know why this lasagna weighs
20 pounds?

484
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:11,706
It tasted like you
threw in a shot put.

485
00:44:13,156 --> 00:44:15,624
I once worked a site
with a guy like you.

486
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:18,227
The guy had a real bad accident.

487
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:23,028
Can't even keep track of them
with so many accidents at sea.

488
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:26,273
Tough to get an ambulance too.

489
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:31,591
Keep it up.

490
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,388
Highflyer!

491
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:43,225
A.P., give me a hand.

492
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:47,025
Hey, how about a little hand
over here?

493
00:44:47,236 --> 00:44:49,591
You do your Job, I'll do mine.

494
00:44:51,436 --> 00:44:52,915
Come on, guys.

495
00:44:54,636 --> 00:44:55,989
Came out here for nothing.

496
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:58,152
Keep moving, keep moving.

497
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:03,229
Come on, Sully, let's get
some bait going here.

498
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:21,389
It's big.

499
00:45:21,596 --> 00:45:22,995
-Something very big.
-Fish on!

500
00:45:23,196 --> 00:45:24,345
Come on, guys.

501
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:25,625
Oh, yeah.

502
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:27,633
Come on. Bring it up.

503
00:45:40,836 --> 00:45:41,825
Bring it up.

504
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:46,391
Get the gaff!

505
00:45:49,276 --> 00:45:50,595
Get it out of here!

506
00:45:50,796 --> 00:45:53,356
Stick him.
Stick it in his head! Good!

507
00:46:00,396 --> 00:46:01,624
Get him off!

508
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:04,428
-He's got my leg!
-Hang on!

509
00:46:08,196 --> 00:46:10,994
Kick your foot out! Kick it!
Kick your foot out.

510
00:46:11,196 --> 00:46:12,390
Get back!

511
00:46:16,676 --> 00:46:18,906
All right, come on, get it out!

512
00:46:19,116 --> 00:46:20,105
Get it out of here.

513
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:23,386
-Pull him back!
-Over the side.

514
00:46:24,636 --> 00:46:25,989
You all right?

515
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:33,667
You're short a boot, rookie!

516
00:46:35,236 --> 00:46:36,954
Beats a leg, don't it?

517
00:46:57,596 --> 00:47:01,271
Okay, we're getting a reading of winds
over 1 40 knots sustained.

518
00:47:01,516 --> 00:47:03,552
Looks like a category 5.

519
00:47:28,716 --> 00:47:32,231
"Billy Tyne is no fine wine

520
00:47:33,796 --> 00:47:36,264
He's lost his touch with our long line

521
00:47:36,676 --> 00:47:40,112
Steamed here and there and all about

522
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:42,788
What's our tally?

523
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,749
We've struck out"

524
00:47:50,436 --> 00:47:53,075
All right, okay.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

525
00:48:04,796 --> 00:48:07,230
Why aren't you downstairs
watching the movie?

526
00:48:08,476 --> 00:48:10,114
One of our three movies?

527
00:48:10,796 --> 00:48:12,388
I know them all by heart.

528
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:17,229
Skip. . .

529
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:20,356
. . .what are you gonna do
about those sets? They suck.

530
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:22,588
We ain't doing nothing.

531
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:25,714
The boys been talking?

532
00:48:26,356 --> 00:48:27,914
About how I lost it?

533
00:48:29,356 --> 00:48:32,826
Billy Tyne's lost it? Gets a little
slow, they'll draw and quarter you.

534
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:35,952
I Just didn't think
you'd go along with it.

535
00:48:36,476 --> 00:48:40,071
I come here because I need the money.
I'm trying for a new start.

536
00:48:40,276 --> 00:48:42,506
Last trip I thought you had
something to offer.

537
00:48:42,716 --> 00:48:44,786
But all in all,
you're Just a little punk.

538
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:49,391
-You promised me a shitload of fish!
-You'll get a shitload of fish.

539
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:52,827
I've been in bad patches so many times
and came home with so much stock. . .

540
00:48:53,036 --> 00:48:55,755
. . .Iittle boys like you had to
pack it on the pier.

541
00:48:55,956 --> 00:48:58,424
I always find the fish! Always!

542
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:01,548
And I will this time!
So don't fuck with me!

543
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:05,149
Aye, aye, skip.

544
00:49:20,036 --> 00:49:21,185
Put them closer!

545
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:25,630
Murph, closer!
Give them a goddamn banquet.

546
00:49:25,836 --> 00:49:27,428
Aye, aye, cap.

547
00:49:28,156 --> 00:49:30,511
You heard him, boys.
Boss ain't happy.

548
00:49:30,716 --> 00:49:32,115
Double-time.

549
00:49:34,076 --> 00:49:35,031
Let's go, Bob.

550
00:49:38,716 --> 00:49:39,831
Sullivan!

551
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:42,871
I gotta hit you with a fish again
to get you to work?

552
00:49:43,076 --> 00:49:44,395
Lightsticks, now!

553
00:49:44,596 --> 00:49:46,268
Shut up, asshole!

554
00:49:46,476 --> 00:49:48,706
You couldn't bait fish in a barrel!

555
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:52,709
-Come on.
-See what I got to deal with?

556
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:54,554
That's a landlubber.
What an idiot!

557
00:49:54,756 --> 00:49:57,668
Come on, Sully.
What are you, a fisherman or a farmer?

558
00:49:57,876 --> 00:49:59,389
Bugs, help him out.

559
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,826
Hurry up, before the captain sees.

560
00:50:02,116 --> 00:50:05,153
Okay, sure, I'll help him out.
What a screwup!

561
00:50:05,396 --> 00:50:08,513
-You're useless, Sully!
-Lay off, Bugs. You never screw up?

562
00:50:08,716 --> 00:50:11,389
You're nothing but a pimple
on the ass of progress.

563
00:50:11,596 --> 00:50:13,552
I've been on a better slab than this.

564
00:50:13,756 --> 00:50:15,269
I've had it with this.

565
00:50:24,076 --> 00:50:25,794
Take it easy.
It was an accident.

566
00:50:30,996 --> 00:50:34,113
You got the easiest Job on the boat,
and you manage to screw it up!

567
00:50:34,356 --> 00:50:37,234
Kiss my ass, you little runt.
And you--!

568
00:50:39,596 --> 00:50:40,506
Murph!

569
00:50:44,396 --> 00:50:46,512
Cap, man overboard!

570
00:50:55,076 --> 00:50:56,748
Take the wheel!

571
00:51:12,676 --> 00:51:14,189
Back her down slow.

572
00:51:58,956 --> 00:52:00,469
Come on, Murph.

573
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:04,274
We've got Murph!

574
00:52:13,036 --> 00:52:14,264
Come on!

575
00:52:32,836 --> 00:52:34,747
You all right? You all right?

576
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:40,505
Come on, Murph.

577
00:52:41,956 --> 00:52:42,991
Come on.

578
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:46,991
Come on.

579
00:53:03,276 --> 00:53:04,994
How was the water, Murph?

580
00:53:05,196 --> 00:53:07,107
Welcome back, Murph!

581
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:11,312
You did it, Murph.

582
00:53:18,036 --> 00:53:19,105
Hold on a minute.

583
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,953
All right, bend over.

584
00:53:29,036 --> 00:53:29,991
Tetanus.

585
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,228
Who's the hero?

586
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:37,627
Bobby and Sully.

587
00:53:38,836 --> 00:53:40,030
Sully?

588
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,828
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dale Murphy out of Cortez, Florida.

589
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:51,392
The only fish the Andrea Gail has
hooked in three days.

590
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:52,870
How you feeling?

591
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:54,191
All right.

592
00:53:55,596 --> 00:53:58,064
-Bobby, thank you.
-Don't worry about it.

593
00:54:01,236 --> 00:54:03,431
Sully was the first one to go in.

594
00:54:08,556 --> 00:54:11,832
So I guess you're the big hero here.

595
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:14,666
Well, you'd have done the same for me.

596
00:54:15,996 --> 00:54:17,588
Isn't that what I'm supposed to say?

597
00:54:20,196 --> 00:54:22,630
Well, you can say what you want. . .

598
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:25,626
. . .but I'm glad you know how to swim.

599
00:54:26,276 --> 00:54:27,948
That's real big of you, Murph.

600
00:54:29,836 --> 00:54:31,235
It's all I can manage now.

601
00:54:32,676 --> 00:54:33,904
All right?

602
00:54:35,036 --> 00:54:36,435
I'll work on it.

603
00:54:41,796 --> 00:54:43,070
Tough guy.

604
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,716
This weather fax Just came in.

605
00:54:57,476 --> 00:54:59,546
Edie, have a look at this.

606
00:55:00,636 --> 00:55:04,151
We have got to head in now!
Put it in at Watch Hill!

607
00:55:04,396 --> 00:55:06,068
In this stuff, harbor's too dangerous.

608
00:55:06,276 --> 00:55:07,026
Dangerous?

609
00:55:07,236 --> 00:55:09,306
Dash into shore,
cut across shipping lanes--

610
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:12,189
This is a hurricane
coming straight at us!

611
00:55:12,436 --> 00:55:15,348
Let me reduce sails, Sandy,
or even go back home.

612
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:16,511
This is my boat.

613
00:55:16,716 --> 00:55:19,469
We'll ride this thing out.
Not for fun, for safety.

614
00:55:19,676 --> 00:55:22,634
Do what I've always done:
Go with the flow.

615
00:55:37,996 --> 00:55:40,385
Holy shit! Rogue wave!

616
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:43,030
Look out!

617
00:55:57,356 --> 00:55:58,266
Everybody here?

618
00:56:09,796 --> 00:56:12,868
Captain, the boys would like
to have a word with you.

619
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:17,190
Take over.

620
00:56:36,556 --> 00:56:38,990
When this meeting's over,
straighten this crap up.

621
00:56:39,756 --> 00:56:41,235
So what's the word?

622
00:56:43,356 --> 00:56:45,916
We're starting to get
an unlucky feeling out here.

623
00:56:46,116 --> 00:56:48,755
Murph going over, the shark,
a rogue wave. . . .

624
00:56:48,956 --> 00:56:49,911
Yeah, what else?

625
00:56:51,516 --> 00:56:55,270
Never mind unlucky.
We're Just looking for some fish.

626
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:59,351
We had slumps before, you and l,
but nothing like this.

627
00:56:59,556 --> 00:57:02,866
You boys look like you got busted
in a brawl in Scollay Square.

628
00:57:03,076 --> 00:57:05,226
That's how we feel.
We want to go home.

629
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:10,555
You want to go home? You lonely for
that young mama who was all over you?

630
00:57:10,756 --> 00:57:12,712
My girl is none of your business.

631
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:16,226
But you are. If you don't like it,
get the hell off! All of you.

632
00:57:19,476 --> 00:57:22,866
I look around and all I see are
little boys sitting on their asses. . .

633
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:25,067
. . .too scared to go
and get some pay dirt.

634
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:28,552
Pay dirt? What are you talking about?
Where the hell is that?

635
00:57:28,756 --> 00:57:30,109
We covered the Grand Banks.

636
00:57:30,436 --> 00:57:33,155
The Grand Banks are west of us.
I'm headed east.

637
00:57:34,636 --> 00:57:35,705
The Flemish Cap.

638
00:57:38,836 --> 00:57:40,428
The Flemish Cap?

639
00:57:40,956 --> 00:57:43,868
Why don't we steam to Portugal
while we're at it?

640
00:57:48,676 --> 00:57:50,906
So this is the moment of truth.

641
00:57:53,836 --> 00:57:56,066
This is where they separate
the men from the boys.

642
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:01,630
How about it?

643
00:58:04,396 --> 00:58:06,114
-Are you Gloucestermen?
-Yeah.

644
00:58:06,356 --> 00:58:09,154
But why go all the way
to the Flemish Cap to prove it?

645
00:58:09,796 --> 00:58:11,275
Tell him, Alfred Pierre.

646
00:58:13,716 --> 00:58:15,229
That's where the fish are.

647
00:58:18,276 --> 00:58:19,834
Do we have any other choice?

648
00:58:20,516 --> 00:58:22,950
Yeah. Crawl home, busted.

649
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:32,827
-All right, skip.
-All right.

650
00:58:34,116 --> 00:58:35,231
All right.

651
00:58:41,356 --> 00:58:45,110
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8- 1,
do you read me+?

652
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:49,110
This is Andrea Gail, Whiskey-
Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8-1 . Hey, Linda.

653
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:52,515
What's happening+?

654
00:58:52,716 --> 00:58:54,069
Slim to none. Where are you+?

655
00:58:54,476 --> 00:58:57,752
Tail of the Banks.
Kicking up something wicked here.

656
00:58:57,956 --> 00:58:59,230
Made a couple of sets.

657
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:00,425
You doing any good?

658
00:59:00,636 --> 00:59:04,948
Nine, first set. Twelve--
No, make that a baker's dozen, second.

659
00:59:05,156 --> 00:59:07,192
Got a couple of markers to boot.

660
00:59:07,436 --> 00:59:10,075
Your hand is so hot,
I can feel the heat from here.

661
00:59:10,636 --> 00:59:13,867
-I've asked you to team up.
-I don 't like partners.

662
00:59:14,076 --> 00:59:15,475
Business-wise, that is.

663
00:59:15,676 --> 00:59:18,349
Okay, okay. What's your position?

664
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:20,831
46 north, 48 west.

665
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:22,709
You headed for the Flemish Cap?

666
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:26,431
The lady knows her coordinates.
Yeah, I'm steaming full-bore.

667
00:59:26,636 --> 00:59:28,513
The Flemish Cap is
nearly off the charts.

668
00:59:28,716 --> 00:59:30,274
What are you trying to prove?

669
00:59:30,516 --> 00:59:34,555
We got gale-force coming out
of Bermuda, stuff out of Sable lsland.

670
00:59:34,756 --> 00:59:37,475
As for me, I'm staring here
at solid white chop.

671
00:59:37,676 --> 00:59:39,234
This could be a triple-header.

672
00:59:39,636 --> 00:59:41,672
You're behind me.
So is your weather.

673
00:59:42,276 --> 00:59:45,348
Yeah, but you've gotta go
through it to get back.

674
00:59:46,076 --> 00:59:47,509
Good point.

675
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:50,514
Billy, you won't like this,
but I'm gonna say it anyway:

676
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:52,115
You be careful.

677
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:53,675
Yes, Mother.

678
00:59:55,996 --> 00:59:58,271
Why don't we pick this up later?
I'm out.

679
01:00:17,596 --> 01:00:19,951
-You guys use some company?
-Sure.

680
01:00:20,356 --> 01:00:22,153
-Coffee?
-Yeah, thanks.

681
01:00:23,756 --> 01:00:26,873
--in the mid-Atlantic,
moving rapidly northeast...

682
01:00:27,076 --> 01:00:28,634
...30-foot waves.

683
01:00:28,836 --> 01:00:29,825
What'd you hear?

684
01:00:30,036 --> 01:00:32,027
They're out on the Flemish Cap.

685
01:00:32,236 --> 01:00:34,625
I got it straight from big Bob Brown.

686
01:00:36,156 --> 01:00:37,271
Yeah.

687
01:00:37,836 --> 01:00:39,428
The Flemish Cap.

688
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:42,506
I went there, '62.

689
01:00:43,716 --> 01:00:45,229
Lots of fish.

690
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:48,034
And lots of weather.

691
01:00:48,556 --> 01:00:49,671
Hurricanes. . .

692
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:51,952
. . .squalls, huge seas.

693
01:00:52,156 --> 01:00:53,748
You're full of shit, Quentin.

694
01:00:55,436 --> 01:00:56,505
That's right.

695
01:00:57,516 --> 01:00:58,585
I am.

696
01:02:27,716 --> 01:02:30,992
-Where are you going?
-To point this boat up into the storm.

697
01:02:31,196 --> 01:02:32,948
And scream for help!

698
01:02:33,156 --> 01:02:36,831
We lie ahull, beam to the waves,
slip sideways. Standard procedure.

699
01:02:37,076 --> 01:02:40,671
Forget it, we won't make it!
Missy, get on the radio now!

700
01:02:40,876 --> 01:02:42,389
-We can make it.
-Mayday!

701
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:45,156
It's sopping wet!
She'll be weeping in the wind. No!

702
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:47,746
We stay below and ride this thing out.

703
01:02:47,956 --> 01:02:49,833
Remember, this is my boat!

704
01:02:50,036 --> 01:02:51,992
This is my life!

705
01:02:52,196 --> 01:02:52,992
Go, Melissa!

706
01:02:57,796 --> 01:02:58,831
Mayday!

707
01:02:59,036 --> 01:03:00,674
Mayday! Mayday!

708
01:03:04,436 --> 01:03:07,553
We're a 32-foot
sailing vessel, Mistral.

709
01:03:08,036 --> 01:03:09,833
Our position is. . .

710
01:03:11,436 --> 01:03:12,835
. . .39.49 north--

711
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:16,792
Mayday! Mayday!

712
01:03:18,876 --> 01:03:19,991
Over.

713
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:49,391
Hey, cap!

714
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:58,628
Ice machine's had it.
It's dead.

715
01:04:01,076 --> 01:04:02,668
-Check the evaporator?
-Yeah.

716
01:04:03,636 --> 01:04:05,069
-Freon?
-Plenty, but nowhere to flow.

717
01:04:05,556 --> 01:04:06,750
Use some spit and glue.

718
01:04:06,996 --> 01:04:09,305
I did. She's fried, skip.

719
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:11,074
I told Brown, get us a new one. . .

720
01:04:11,276 --> 01:04:13,551
. . .but he gets another overhaul,
son of a bitch!

721
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,465
Sorry.

722
01:04:27,236 --> 01:04:28,874
The ice machine's gone.

723
01:04:30,796 --> 01:04:32,115
Oh, fuck.

724
01:04:39,596 --> 01:04:41,666
All right,
we got good ice on them now.

725
01:04:41,956 --> 01:04:43,548
We seal the fish hold.

726
01:04:43,756 --> 01:04:46,509
With luck, we'll deliver
the catch and set the market.

727
01:04:48,196 --> 01:04:49,470
Pull up the gear.

728
01:04:51,556 --> 01:04:52,830
We're going home.

729
01:04:55,876 --> 01:04:58,549
Put these babies on ice,
and we're out of here!

730
01:05:17,356 --> 01:05:20,871
We are taking heavy waves.
Damage on deck.

731
01:05:23,436 --> 01:05:25,472
Need immediate assistance.

732
01:05:25,676 --> 01:05:28,827
We're beam to the sea
and taking on water.

733
01:05:29,036 --> 01:05:31,596
Just so you understand
what we're up against.

734
01:05:32,516 --> 01:05:36,794
We're looking at 40 to 50-foot waves,
gale-force winds. A real bad one.

735
01:05:36,996 --> 01:05:38,429
Right in our path.

736
01:05:39,116 --> 01:05:41,471
The Weather Service
is Jerking off again.

737
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:42,631
No.

738
01:05:43,756 --> 01:05:45,235
You're afraid?

739
01:05:45,596 --> 01:05:47,393
I never seen you scared.

740
01:05:48,116 --> 01:05:50,676
It's pretty rough stuff out there,
that's for sure.

741
01:05:51,716 --> 01:05:54,594
We either hang out here
for a few days till it calms down--

742
01:05:54,796 --> 01:05:55,911
But, cap. . .

743
01:05:56,116 --> 01:05:58,630
. . .we got 60,000 pounds of fish here.

744
01:05:58,836 --> 01:06:00,508
Are we gonna let it spoil?

745
01:06:00,716 --> 01:06:03,628
I thought we were gonna
set the market, make a killing.

746
01:06:03,836 --> 01:06:06,475
Or we say the hell with it.

747
01:06:07,116 --> 01:06:08,947
We drive right through it.

748
01:06:16,716 --> 01:06:18,627
You said we're Gloucestermen.

749
01:06:24,436 --> 01:06:25,915
What do you say, guys?

750
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:27,754
Are we or aren't we?

751
01:06:28,876 --> 01:06:30,195
Did we come out here for nothing?

752
01:06:30,436 --> 01:06:32,631
-It's a lot of money.
-Let's make some money.

753
01:06:32,836 --> 01:06:35,714
Come on. Let's hear it, Gloucester!

754
01:06:36,756 --> 01:06:40,351
Let's get her lashed down.
Bugs, put the birds in the water.

755
01:06:40,556 --> 01:06:42,433
Birds in. Got it, skip.

756
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:52,388
Look. Look at this.

757
01:06:53,396 --> 01:06:56,672
We got Hurricane Grace moving north
off the Atlantic seaboard.

758
01:06:57,196 --> 01:06:58,424
Huge. . .

759
01:06:58,636 --> 01:07:00,592
. . .getting massive.

760
01:07:00,796 --> 01:07:04,505
Two, this low south of Sable lsland,
ready to explode.

761
01:07:05,436 --> 01:07:06,585
Look at this.

762
01:07:07,076 --> 01:07:11,388
Three, a fresh cold front
swooping down from Canada.

763
01:07:12,036 --> 01:07:14,106
But it's caught a ride
on the Jet stream. . .

764
01:07:14,356 --> 01:07:16,995
. . .and is motoring hell-bent
towards the Atlantic.

765
01:07:17,636 --> 01:07:18,591
Cool.

766
01:07:18,876 --> 01:07:19,865
Wait, wait.

767
01:07:21,116 --> 01:07:23,505
What if Hurricane Grace
runs smack into it?

768
01:07:24,036 --> 01:07:28,109
Add to the scenario this baby off
Sable lsland, scrounging for energy.

769
01:07:28,396 --> 01:07:31,832
She'll start feeding off
both the Canadian cold front. . .

770
01:07:32,196 --> 01:07:34,107
. . .and Hurricane Grace.

771
01:07:34,756 --> 01:07:36,747
You could be a meteorologist
all your life. . .

772
01:07:36,956 --> 01:07:38,105
. . .and never see something like this.

773
01:07:40,087 --> 01:07:43,238
It would be a disaster
of epic proportions.

774
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:45,646
It would be...

775
01:07:45,847 --> 01:07:47,644
... the perfect storm.

776
01:07:58,687 --> 01:07:59,756
Let's get down below.

777
01:08:01,047 --> 01:08:02,002
Bobby?

778
01:08:02,807 --> 01:08:04,320
I want you up here with me.

779
01:08:19,207 --> 01:08:21,721
Mayday! Mayday!

780
01:08:26,087 --> 01:08:29,682
Sailing vessel Mistral,
this is Coast Guard rescue.

781
01:08:29,887 --> 01:08:31,036
Sandy!

782
01:08:33,687 --> 01:08:36,724
Edie, they heard me!
They're coming!

783
01:08:47,287 --> 01:08:49,198
Air Force rescue 2-3- 1.

784
01:08:49,407 --> 01:08:51,159
We've located the Mistral.

785
01:08:51,407 --> 01:08:53,637
Position: 39.49 north...

786
01:08:53,847 --> 01:08:55,883
... 69. 52 west.

787
01:08:58,407 --> 01:08:59,886
How far's that last position?

788
01:09:00,087 --> 01:09:01,918
About 20.3 miles, captain.

789
01:09:02,127 --> 01:09:03,958
OD, boatswain on the bridge.

790
01:09:08,927 --> 01:09:10,440
Tallyho, there they are.

791
01:09:15,767 --> 01:09:18,520
-Okay, guys, showtime.
-You got it.

792
01:09:18,967 --> 01:09:20,719
Mistral, this is 2-3-1 .

793
01:09:20,927 --> 01:09:24,078
We're gonna extract you
one at a time from the deck.

794
01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:26,557
Hey, Jeremy, I don't like this.

795
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:30,124
-Clock's ticking.
-Come on, we better get them off now.

796
01:09:30,327 --> 01:09:31,316
Get closer, Darryl.

797
01:09:31,647 --> 01:09:32,875
Just a little closer.

798
01:09:37,767 --> 01:09:39,758
Okay, deploying the basket.

799
01:09:40,727 --> 01:09:42,206
Close to 2:00.

800
01:09:42,447 --> 01:09:43,641
Let's come right to 5.

801
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:46,283
-Four. Three.
-Son of a bitch.

802
01:09:46,487 --> 01:09:48,318
Stop there. Hold your hover.

803
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:49,682
Goddamn it!

804
01:09:49,887 --> 01:09:52,162
Keep it steady, keep it steady.

805
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:54,996
Shit!

806
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:02,726
Man out!

807
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:05,437
-Shear the cable!
-No, I got it!

808
01:10:22,287 --> 01:10:23,242
Shit.

809
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,920
Bring up the basket!

810
01:10:28,447 --> 01:10:29,675
Sandy!

811
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:31,721
Hold on!

812
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,155
I got you!

813
01:10:33,487 --> 01:10:35,842
-Basket's in.
-Looks like I'm going for a swim.

814
01:10:36,047 --> 01:10:37,162
Okay, go get them.

815
01:10:37,407 --> 01:10:38,965
Mitchell off intercom.

816
01:10:39,927 --> 01:10:41,326
It's time to get wet.

817
01:10:43,527 --> 01:10:45,563
We're gonna be all right.

818
01:10:47,087 --> 01:10:48,042
Go.

819
01:11:22,207 --> 01:11:23,162
Altitude.

820
01:11:24,287 --> 01:11:26,323
Altitude. Get her up, get her up!

821
01:11:31,807 --> 01:11:32,922
He's in the water.

822
01:11:36,687 --> 01:11:38,245
I'm going after him!

823
01:11:38,447 --> 01:11:39,800
No, no, wait! Stand by!

824
01:11:42,007 --> 01:11:43,486
Jonesy, hold on.

825
01:11:52,047 --> 01:11:53,241
There! He's okay.

826
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:56,406
This isn't working.
They'll have to get in the water.

827
01:12:07,247 --> 01:12:09,238
Come on, come on!

828
01:12:10,087 --> 01:12:11,566
You're having a blast, huh?

829
01:12:11,767 --> 01:12:14,884
-Want a turn?
-No, Just watch. I want to watch.

830
01:12:15,087 --> 01:12:17,760
I'm studying up for the day
I get my own boat.

831
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:19,719
Your own boat, huh?

832
01:12:19,927 --> 01:12:22,236
Want to give me a hand?
Grab the throttle.

833
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:26,206
Hang on.

834
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:30,919
-Ah, shit!
-Seven K, six easy.

835
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:32,685
-Eight minimum.
-Ten.

836
01:12:33,127 --> 01:12:36,278
You know, I'm gonna get me
a new used Ford F-1 50. . .

837
01:12:36,527 --> 01:12:38,438
. . .take a ride to Digby with lrene.

838
01:12:38,647 --> 01:12:42,640
Going to get drunk, eat like a pig
and sleep like a child!

839
01:12:42,847 --> 01:12:44,246
Fish and fun-gee!

840
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:51,679
Okay, Jer, too risky to go lower.
You gotta Jump from here.

841
01:13:07,287 --> 01:13:10,643
Good afternoon, madam.
I'm Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell.

842
01:13:10,847 --> 01:13:13,122
I'll be your para-rescue Jumper today.

843
01:13:13,447 --> 01:13:14,846
How are you?

844
01:13:15,087 --> 01:13:16,600
Okay so far.

845
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:34,765
Keep your hands
and feet in the basket.

846
01:13:38,687 --> 01:13:39,915
-Careful.
-Okay!

847
01:13:40,127 --> 01:13:41,719
All right, here we go.

848
01:13:48,727 --> 01:13:49,637
You're next.

849
01:14:00,847 --> 01:14:02,485
That was nothing!

850
01:14:02,927 --> 01:14:03,916
Come on!

851
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:19,200
Oh, my God.

852
01:14:20,047 --> 01:14:21,560
It's happening.

853
01:14:57,727 --> 01:15:00,764
Andrea Gail, Andrea Gail.
This is Hannah Boden.

854
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,316
--Billy, over.

855
01:15:07,967 --> 01:15:09,082
Calling the Andrea Gail.

856
01:15:15,287 --> 01:15:17,596
Andrea Gail, do you read me?

857
01:15:17,807 --> 01:15:19,877
Do you read me? Come in!

858
01:15:20,087 --> 01:15:24,046
Come in, for God's sake, come in!
Billy, these storms have collided!

859
01:15:24,247 --> 01:15:25,600
They are exploding!

860
01:15:27,967 --> 01:15:29,195
Who is it?

861
01:15:29,847 --> 01:15:30,643
I don't know.

862
01:15:30,847 --> 01:15:32,599
Andrea Gail, come in!

863
01:15:33,807 --> 01:15:36,765
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1 , over.

864
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:38,400
Talk to me, Billy, over.

865
01:15:38,607 --> 01:15:40,916
I repeat,
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1 --

866
01:15:42,967 --> 01:15:45,276
Look at your fax, damn it!
Look at your fax!

867
01:15:45,487 --> 01:15:48,445
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1 , over!

868
01:15:48,647 --> 01:15:50,956
-Where are you, Billy+?
-Linda?

869
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,316
Give me the coordinates.

870
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:55,564
-44 north, 56.4 west.
-We're 44 north. . .

871
01:15:55,767 --> 01:15:58,406
... 56.4 west, headed west.

872
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:03,602
I repeat, 44 north,
56.4 west, headed--

873
01:16:04,447 --> 01:16:05,960
Over.

874
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:08,556
Billy, get out of there.

875
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:12,318
Come about! Let it carry you out!
What the hell are you doing?

876
01:16:12,567 --> 01:16:13,602
Hang on!

877
01:16:15,247 --> 01:16:18,444
Billy! Billy, for chrissake!

878
01:16:18,647 --> 01:16:22,037
You're steaming into a bomb!
Turn around, for chrissake!

879
01:16:24,407 --> 01:16:25,442
It's the antenna.

880
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:27,763
Billy, can you hear me?

881
01:16:28,087 --> 01:16:31,523
You're headed right
for the middle of the monster.

882
01:16:40,727 --> 01:16:42,479
Oh, my God.

883
01:16:51,087 --> 01:16:52,076
Hang on!

884
01:16:53,767 --> 01:16:54,916
Take the wheel.

885
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:56,726
No, I'll go.

886
01:16:58,687 --> 01:17:00,484
Mayday, mayday, mayday. . .

887
01:17:00,687 --> 01:17:02,325
. . .Coast Guard Boston.

888
01:17:03,127 --> 01:17:06,119
This is fishing vessel Hannah Boden
relaying a mayday. . .

889
01:17:06,327 --> 01:17:08,477
. . .for swordboat Andrea Gail.

890

891
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:15,283
. . .56.4 west, over.

892
01:17:16,247 --> 01:17:20,399
Advise you proceed to next incident
at your discretion, over.

893
01:17:20,607 --> 01:17:22,325
Yeah, roger, Boston.

894
01:17:22,527 --> 01:17:25,280
I Just got a mayday on a Gloucester
swordboat, the Andrea Gail.

895
01:17:25,527 --> 01:17:29,759
44 north, 56.4 west, headed west.

896
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,601
Jesus. That's straight into hell.

897
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:35,566
Gloucester.
They're always from Gloucester.

898
01:17:35,767 --> 01:17:39,396
It's an increased-risk mission,
so, you know, it's up to us.

899
01:17:39,607 --> 01:17:41,677
I'm getting
a little air-to-air feeling.

900
01:17:41,887 --> 01:17:43,764
Refuel in hell?
That's pretty sporty.

901
01:17:44,087 --> 01:17:45,998
Call the cutter.
We're coming in hot.

902
01:17:46,407 --> 01:17:49,126
People, slight change of plans!

903
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:52,400
We're gonna drop you on
the Coast Guard cutter Tamaroa.

904
01:17:52,607 --> 01:17:55,599
We got some swordfishermen
who have lost their way.

905
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,560
Or their minds.

906
01:18:37,207 --> 01:18:40,119
This is rescue 2-3- 1
on final approach.

907
01:18:40,327 --> 01:18:43,956
Rescue 2-3- 1, flight deck is green.

908
01:18:44,567 --> 01:18:46,876
There it is.
You're being waved in.

909
01:18:47,087 --> 01:18:48,645
Thirty meters and closing.

910
01:18:48,847 --> 01:18:51,122
Twenty-five meters, winds 43.

911
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:53,522
Set a line at 0-1 -0.

912
01:18:53,967 --> 01:18:56,242
Beautiful. We're coming.

913
01:18:56,447 --> 01:18:57,596
Watch this wave, cap.

914
01:18:57,807 --> 01:18:59,763
2-3- 1, looking good.
Transfer at will.

915
01:18:59,967 --> 01:19:01,002
Drop ladder.

916
01:19:04,087 --> 01:19:05,679
All right, send them down.

917
01:19:05,887 --> 01:19:07,002
Put your foot out.

918
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:08,517
Left leg out.

919
01:19:08,727 --> 01:19:10,524
Mind your helm, goddamn it.

920
01:19:12,927 --> 01:19:14,280
Watch the deck!

921
01:19:15,407 --> 01:19:16,601
Come on.

922
01:19:17,447 --> 01:19:19,085
First survivor on deck.

923
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:22,677
-Where's our fuel?
-Refueling tanker is on the way.

924
01:19:23,727 --> 01:19:25,604
Second survivor on deck.

925
01:19:25,847 --> 01:19:26,962
Jesus.

926
01:20:24,927 --> 01:20:25,882
It's gone.

927
01:20:28,247 --> 01:20:31,762
No antenna, no radio.
We're back in the 1 9th century.

928
01:20:35,687 --> 01:20:37,484
You want to call it quits,
turn around?

929
01:20:38,687 --> 01:20:39,676
What do you think?

930
01:20:41,567 --> 01:20:42,920
I think she's a hell of a boat.

931
01:20:43,487 --> 01:20:44,715
With a hell of a crew.

932
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,281
And a hell of a skipper.

933
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:52,764
All right then, Gloucester. . .

934
01:20:52,967 --> 01:20:54,320
. . .we're coming home!

935
01:21:13,727 --> 01:21:14,921
Take the wheel!

936
01:21:15,527 --> 01:21:16,437
Skipper, don't!

937
01:21:16,647 --> 01:21:19,525
Take the goddamn wheel!
That's an order!

938
01:21:29,847 --> 01:21:31,644
Damn, I can't see anything.

939
01:21:37,887 --> 01:21:39,718
What's the gauge say?

940
01:21:40,847 --> 01:21:43,520
It's low, Jonesy.
Where are they?

941
01:21:43,727 --> 01:21:46,525
-Tanker's on the way.
-How many stops are they making?

942
01:21:49,247 --> 01:21:50,202
No!

943
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:54,157
Come on! Not again.

944
01:21:54,727 --> 01:21:56,877
Hello? Ethel, thank God!

945
01:21:57,087 --> 01:22:00,557
I'm going crazy here.
Even the weather guy's gone bananas.

946
01:22:00,767 --> 01:22:03,645
Have you heard from--?
Hello? Ethel?

947
01:22:04,767 --> 01:22:05,802
Shit!

948
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:30,203
There she is! Thank God.

949
01:22:30,447 --> 01:22:33,405
Let's fill her up, save these yahoos
and get out of here.

950
01:22:33,727 --> 01:22:35,718
King 1 -2, we have visual.

951
01:22:35,967 --> 01:22:39,676
Air Force rescue 2-3-1 ,
you've got a wet hose.

952
01:23:30,007 --> 01:23:32,441
All right now, hold on!

953
01:23:48,407 --> 01:23:49,886
In the water!

954
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:52,000
Hold on, skip!

955
01:24:38,647 --> 01:24:39,921
Shit.

956
01:25:04,127 --> 01:25:05,116
Come on, skip!

957
01:25:08,767 --> 01:25:11,042
Come on, skip, come on!

958
01:25:37,927 --> 01:25:38,803
Yeah!

959
01:25:46,487 --> 01:25:47,806
Anything yet?

960
01:25:48,007 --> 01:25:49,042
Nothing about boats.

961
01:25:49,247 --> 01:25:51,602
-I got four nines.
-He's a liar.

962
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:52,956
Florence.

963
01:25:55,207 --> 01:25:57,437
Damage estimates
are in the high millions.

964
01:25:57,647 --> 01:25:59,239
Folks, the worst is yet to come.

965
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:01,159
The storm of the century.

966
01:26:01,407 --> 01:26:04,319
Residents, stay inside,
pack sandbags against door frames.

967
01:26:04,567 --> 01:26:08,003
A report here that Cape Ann
fishing industry is in tatters.

968
01:26:08,207 --> 01:26:11,199
Lobstermen from Gloucester to Scituate
have lost their traps.

969
01:26:11,487 --> 01:26:15,605
A missing swordboat, Andrea Gail,
out of Gloucester with a crew of six.

970
01:26:15,807 --> 01:26:18,924
An Air National Guard rescue
helicopter has been dispatched.

971
01:26:19,127 --> 01:26:22,437
At Logan lnternational Airport,
flooded runways.

972
01:26:30,607 --> 01:26:31,835
We did it!

973
01:26:40,527 --> 01:26:42,882
-Get those windows boarded up!
-All right, skip.

974
01:26:43,087 --> 01:26:44,759
Come on, board it up!

975
01:26:49,607 --> 01:26:52,565
Tell those guys forget it.
We'll get our gas somewhere else.

976
01:27:04,927 --> 01:27:05,962
What do you think?

977
01:27:13,207 --> 01:27:14,765
We're running on fumes.

978
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:18,839
King 1 -2, this isn't gonna work.

979
01:27:20,087 --> 01:27:21,759
This is not our night.

980
01:27:23,967 --> 01:27:27,926
We're issuing a mayday.
Give the Coast Guard our coordinates.

981
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:30,966
We're ditching.

982
01:27:34,487 --> 01:27:38,275
Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1
calling Coast Guard Tamaroa.

983
01:27:38,487 --> 01:27:42,321
Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1
calling Coast Guard Tamaroa.

984
01:27:43,127 --> 01:27:45,595
King 1 -2, departing the area.

985
01:27:49,647 --> 01:27:50,636
Come on!

986
01:27:50,967 --> 01:27:52,446
Let's get it up!

987
01:27:58,007 --> 01:27:59,804
All right, guys, get ready!

988
01:28:01,327 --> 01:28:02,555
Hold on!

989
01:28:02,807 --> 01:28:04,286
Get it up there!

990
01:28:07,607 --> 01:28:08,676
Get another one.

991
01:28:08,887 --> 01:28:09,956
Come on.

992
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:21,045
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Grab them, grab them!

993
01:28:23,327 --> 01:28:25,204
Hang on, there's a swell!

994
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:36,883
Come on, guys, try to get you close.

995
01:28:37,087 --> 01:28:39,123
-Stay together.
-Roger that.

996
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:45,522
Number 1 is out!

997
01:28:47,127 --> 01:28:48,446
Bail! Bail out!

998
01:28:48,807 --> 01:28:51,765
-Leave yourself enough time, okay?
-I'll be fine.

999
01:29:02,487 --> 01:29:03,636
Go, Jonesy, go!

1000
01:29:07,767 --> 01:29:09,246
You're next.

1001
01:29:12,607 --> 01:29:14,006
Hold on, hold on!

1002
01:29:25,247 --> 01:29:26,885
Now, Jeremy, now!
Go! Bail out!

1003
01:29:27,207 --> 01:29:28,686
See you, Darryl.

1004
01:29:40,647 --> 01:29:42,956
No, no, no, no. No!

1005
01:30:53,567 --> 01:30:54,920
Over here!

1006
01:30:55,127 --> 01:30:58,005
We're over here!

1007
01:31:10,687 --> 01:31:12,086
Have you seen Mitchell?

1008
01:31:13,047 --> 01:31:13,957
No.

1009
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:15,395
What about Jonesy?

1010
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:17,795
Nothing. Just you.

1011
01:31:18,967 --> 01:31:21,037
Goddamn it, we don't lose anybody!

1012
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:28,805
Come on, lay it on.

1013
01:31:29,527 --> 01:31:31,199
-Get it locked!
-Get them on!

1014
01:31:40,007 --> 01:31:41,645
They're not gonna make it!

1015
01:31:41,847 --> 01:31:43,724
Tell them to hold on.
I'll turn the boat.

1016
01:31:49,007 --> 01:31:50,281
Right now, let's go!

1017
01:31:55,567 --> 01:31:57,398
Come on, guys, you can do it!

1018
01:31:57,607 --> 01:31:59,598
It's Jammed! It's Jammed!

1019
01:32:03,447 --> 01:32:04,846
Lock it down!

1020
01:32:13,847 --> 01:32:15,075
I can't hold her!

1021
01:32:21,927 --> 01:32:23,155
Come on, get it up.

1022
01:32:23,647 --> 01:32:24,762
Put it on now!

1023
01:32:24,967 --> 01:32:26,320
Come on, this is it.

1024
01:32:27,647 --> 01:32:29,558
-Get it on.
-I'm trying!

1025
01:32:29,767 --> 01:32:30,597
Get it on.

1026
01:32:36,607 --> 01:32:38,006
It's loose. I got it!

1027
01:32:45,047 --> 01:32:45,957
Man overboard!

1028
01:32:46,647 --> 01:32:48,524
-What?!
-Two over the side.

1029
01:32:53,247 --> 01:32:55,078
Come on, help me!

1030
01:32:55,287 --> 01:32:56,402
Hold on, I got you!

1031
01:32:59,287 --> 01:33:00,720
Grab the line!

1032
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:13,961
Oh, God.

1033
01:33:14,567 --> 01:33:16,398
We lost Bugsy!

1034
01:33:25,807 --> 01:33:26,717
Bugsy!

1035
01:33:47,327 --> 01:33:48,999
Hold on. Grab this.

1036
01:33:57,887 --> 01:33:59,161
Hold on!

1037
01:34:02,447 --> 01:34:04,836
Come on, Bugsy. Grab it!

1038
01:34:11,327 --> 01:34:12,282
Grab it!

1039
01:34:14,127 --> 01:34:15,082
Bugsy!

1040
01:34:47,207 --> 01:34:48,720
There! Right there!

1041
01:34:48,927 --> 01:34:50,838
Come on, let's go!

1042
01:35:05,567 --> 01:35:08,320
I'm here, Jeremy, I'm here.
I got you. We're here.

1043
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:11,517
Hey, talk to me, J. Talk to me.

1044
01:35:11,727 --> 01:35:14,161
I'm all busted up, cap.

1045
01:35:14,527 --> 01:35:16,040
Can't breathe.

1046
01:35:16,247 --> 01:35:19,762
-Hey, Mitch, have you seen Jonesy?
-No.

1047
01:35:19,967 --> 01:35:22,800
Go find him. Go find Jonesy.
Go get him.

1048
01:36:01,647 --> 01:36:03,205
Boys, that's it.

1049
01:36:04,687 --> 01:36:05,915
We can't make it.

1050
01:36:12,047 --> 01:36:13,560
We're turning around.

1051
01:36:18,127 --> 01:36:19,958
Come on, cap, we can do it.

1052
01:36:20,607 --> 01:36:22,006
What about our catch?

1053
01:36:22,687 --> 01:36:24,166
We'll mug them next time.

1054
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:28,039
This piece of water belongs to us.

1055
01:36:29,407 --> 01:36:31,967
The fish will gather again
for the Andrea Gail...

1056
01:36:35,767 --> 01:36:36,677
. . .when we come back.

1057
01:36:38,687 --> 01:36:40,962
This is gonna be
the turnaround of all time.

1058
01:36:42,407 --> 01:36:43,681
Textbook.

1059
01:36:44,767 --> 01:36:46,325
So get ready.

1060
01:37:17,687 --> 01:37:20,201
If it were good news,
he would've called us.

1061
01:37:21,647 --> 01:37:25,242
The news is the rescue helicopter
had to ditch.

1062
01:37:25,487 --> 01:37:27,762
We can't raise the Andrea Gail.

1063
01:37:29,847 --> 01:37:30,962
What does that mean?

1064
01:37:31,647 --> 01:37:33,239
We don't know anything.

1065
01:37:33,767 --> 01:37:37,396
If anyone can survive this storm,
it's Billy Tyne. I'll give him that.

1066
01:37:37,607 --> 01:37:39,006
What do you want?

1067
01:37:39,567 --> 01:37:42,320
Credit for having the guts
to walk in here?

1068
01:37:42,567 --> 01:37:43,443
I do.

1069
01:37:44,127 --> 01:37:45,719
Give it to him.

1070
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:47,516
How you doing, Quentin?

1071
01:37:48,247 --> 01:37:49,839
Pretty good, governor.

1072
01:37:50,647 --> 01:37:52,603
You're counting your money.

1073
01:37:52,807 --> 01:37:57,244
And my guy is out there risking
his life for a bunch of stupid fish.

1074
01:37:57,807 --> 01:37:58,762
That's the game.

1075
01:37:59,927 --> 01:38:03,715
I hate the game.
I hate the goddamn game!

1076
01:38:03,927 --> 01:38:04,916
Do you hear me?!

1077
01:38:05,127 --> 01:38:07,960
Do you read me, governor?
Do you?!

1078
01:38:08,167 --> 01:38:09,805
Do you read me?!

1079
01:38:17,607 --> 01:38:19,199
Did you see him?

1080
01:38:19,447 --> 01:38:21,039
I don't see anything!

1081
01:38:25,287 --> 01:38:27,847
Look! There's the cutter.

1082
01:38:35,767 --> 01:38:38,725
-Have them put out the cargo net.
-Cargo net, aye, sir.

1083
01:38:40,007 --> 01:38:41,565
Put me alongside them.

1084
01:38:42,287 --> 01:38:45,723
I want five men on that net.
And get the light out there.

1085
01:38:45,927 --> 01:38:47,519
Okay, guys, hook in!

1086
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,326
Pick it up! Move!

1087
01:38:51,567 --> 01:38:53,319
Keep your light on those swimmers!

1088
01:38:53,567 --> 01:38:54,682
Get ready!

1089
01:38:55,807 --> 01:38:57,957
Release the net now!

1090
01:38:58,927 --> 01:39:01,236
Okay, now, Jeremy, swim!

1091
01:39:01,847 --> 01:39:03,519
Swim!

1092
01:39:14,487 --> 01:39:15,886
Give him a hand!

1093
01:39:16,087 --> 01:39:18,237
Get ready!

1094
01:39:18,487 --> 01:39:19,840
Come on!

1095
01:39:50,687 --> 01:39:53,520
All right! Let's do it again.

1096
01:39:53,727 --> 01:39:55,957
If they can't get to us,
we'll get to them.

1097
01:39:56,167 --> 01:39:58,237
Go up swell and drift down.

1098
01:39:58,487 --> 01:39:59,886
Broadside, captain?

1099
01:40:00,087 --> 01:40:02,396
Isn't it too dangerous?
It's too hairy.

1100
01:40:02,607 --> 01:40:04,120
I won't let two men drown!

1101
01:40:07,247 --> 01:40:09,681
Hold on, Jer. Just hold on.

1102
01:40:21,287 --> 01:40:23,642
When I say now, you go full throttle.
Got it?

1103
01:40:27,527 --> 01:40:29,438
We only get one chance at this.

1104
01:40:30,887 --> 01:40:31,797
And then?

1105
01:40:33,647 --> 01:40:34,716
We pray.

1106
01:40:51,727 --> 01:40:52,796
Wait.

1107
01:40:54,287 --> 01:40:55,242
Wait.

1108
01:41:04,807 --> 01:41:05,956
Wait.

1109
01:41:07,647 --> 01:41:08,602
Wait.

1110
01:41:19,567 --> 01:41:20,795
Now!

1111
01:41:30,007 --> 01:41:31,486
Faster!

1112
01:42:44,727 --> 01:42:46,126
We did it!

1113
01:42:47,687 --> 01:42:48,756
Guys, we're alive!

1114
01:42:49,287 --> 01:42:51,676
We made the turn! We did it!

1115
01:42:55,887 --> 01:42:58,447
Hey, skip, I'm giving you notice.

1116
01:42:58,647 --> 01:42:59,762
This is my last trip.

1117
01:42:59,967 --> 01:43:03,403
When we get back, I'm going right to
Salisbury Beach with Chris.

1118
01:43:03,607 --> 01:43:06,246
We're riding those go-carts,
full-time.

1119
01:43:09,567 --> 01:43:11,080
What do you think, skip?

1120
01:43:11,527 --> 01:43:13,404
We're doing 1 2 knots.

1121
01:43:13,727 --> 01:43:16,958
We keep this up,
make it through till dawn. . .

1122
01:43:17,767 --> 01:43:19,325
. . .we might get out of here.

1123
01:43:26,927 --> 01:43:28,440
They're coming around, Jeremy.

1124
01:43:28,647 --> 01:43:31,286
I can't make it, cap.
They're coming for you.

1125
01:43:31,527 --> 01:43:33,085
You're wrong, Jer!

1126
01:43:33,287 --> 01:43:34,561
They're coming for us.

1127
01:43:35,287 --> 01:43:37,642
I'm not gonna leave you here, Jer.

1128
01:43:38,647 --> 01:43:41,957
You have Just one chance to
grab ahold of those nets.

1129
01:43:42,167 --> 01:43:43,998
-You roger that?
-Okay.

1130
01:43:51,727 --> 01:43:53,763
-Back full!
-Back full on!

1131
01:44:04,007 --> 01:44:06,441
You gotta swim now, Jer!

1132
01:44:16,767 --> 01:44:18,803
Grab it, Jer, Just grab it!

1133
01:44:34,527 --> 01:44:35,676
Come on!

1134
01:44:45,447 --> 01:44:46,846
Climb! Climb!

1135
01:44:47,767 --> 01:44:48,756
Reach!

1136
01:44:55,127 --> 01:44:56,924
We lost one! Pick up the net!

1137
01:44:59,087 --> 01:45:02,124
Come on! Give me your hand!

1138
01:45:12,087 --> 01:45:16,603
Reach and grab it with everything
you got. Everything you've got!

1139
01:45:22,607 --> 01:45:23,881
Hold on!

1140
01:45:25,767 --> 01:45:27,246
Pull!

1141
01:45:31,247 --> 01:45:34,159
Yes! Get them inside
and clear this deck.

1142
01:45:38,967 --> 01:45:40,605
All right, let's go.

1143
01:45:42,287 --> 01:45:45,404
There's another man out there!
There's another man!

1144
01:45:45,607 --> 01:45:46,517
Jonesy!

1145
01:45:47,647 --> 01:45:49,877
Jonesy!

1146
01:46:50,047 --> 01:46:51,719
Skip, we're gonna make it.

1147
01:47:30,927 --> 01:47:32,883
She's not gonna let us out.

1148
01:47:58,447 --> 01:47:59,516
No.

1149
01:48:08,087 --> 01:48:10,396
Come on, you bitch!

1150
01:48:17,207 --> 01:48:19,163
Come on!

1151
01:48:29,207 --> 01:48:30,606
Come on!

1152
01:49:12,807 --> 01:49:14,877
Come on. We gotta get out.

1153
01:49:18,287 --> 01:49:19,800
How do we do this, skip?

1154
01:49:20,087 --> 01:49:21,679
No school for it.

1155
01:49:21,887 --> 01:49:23,002
Never was.

1156
01:49:45,567 --> 01:49:47,717
This is gonna be hard
on my little boy.

1157
01:50:04,087 --> 01:50:05,042
Bobby. . .

1158
01:50:06,447 --> 01:50:08,199
. . .I'm sorry I got you into this.

1159
01:50:10,207 --> 01:50:12,277
Skip, we made the right call.

1160
01:50:12,887 --> 01:50:14,320
We had to try.

1161
01:50:15,887 --> 01:50:17,400
We were so close.

1162
01:50:23,327 --> 01:50:25,795
It was a hell of a fight, though, huh?

1163
01:50:35,287 --> 01:50:37,084
Let's get out of here, huh?

1164
01:51:45,767 --> 01:51:47,200
Christina.

1165
01:51:48,247 --> 01:51:50,158
Christina, can you hear me+?

1166
01:51:51,687 --> 01:51:54,599
I don 't know if you can,
but I'm talking to you, baby.

1167
01:51:56,247 --> 01:51:58,317
Do you know how much I love you+?

1168
01:51:58,967 --> 01:52:01,197
I loved you the moment I saw you.

1169
01:52:01,767 --> 01:52:03,041
I love you now...

1170
01:52:04,047 --> 01:52:05,799
...and I'll love you forever.

1171
01:52:07,127 --> 01:52:08,480
No goodbye.

1172
01:52:09,687 --> 01:52:11,723
There's only love, Christina.

1173
01:52:12,727 --> 01:52:14,001
Only love.

1174
01:52:44,567 --> 01:52:47,286
It's been a week of round-the-clock
flights involving...

1175
01:52:47,487 --> 01:52:50,479
...efforts of half a dozen Northeast
air rescue stations.

1176
01:52:50,687 --> 01:52:54,475
However, as of this hour, the Coast
Guard has suspended its search...

1177
01:52:54,687 --> 01:52:58,123
...for Air National Guard
para-rescue jumper Millard Jones.

1178
01:52:58,327 --> 01:53:00,477
He leaves a wife and three daughters.

1179
01:53:00,687 --> 01:53:03,201
The search for the Andrea Gail
out of Gloucester...

1180
01:53:03,447 --> 01:53:06,484
...has also been suspended
after aircrafts covered...

1181
01:53:06,687 --> 01:53:09,440
... 1 16,000 square miles of ocean...

1182
01:53:09,647 --> 01:53:12,002
... without finding a single survivor.

1183
01:53:12,207 --> 01:53:14,801
We'll have more news
after these messages.

1184
01:54:07,647 --> 01:54:09,444
I knew Billy Tyne.

1185
01:54:10,527 --> 01:54:13,041
I did not know his crew very well.

1186
01:54:13,927 --> 01:54:17,806
But any man who sailed with him
must've been the better for it.

1187
01:54:19,487 --> 01:54:20,966

1194

. . .is of no consolation.

1197
01:54:49,847 --> 01:54:51,565
It can't be visited.

1198
01:54:51,967 --> 01:54:55,482
There is no headstone on which
to rest a bunch of flowers.

1199
01:54:55,807 --> 01:54:58,275
The only place we can revisit them. . .

1200
01:54:58,527 --> 01:55:01,485
. . .is in our hearts or in our dreams.

1201
01:55:04,327 --> 01:55:07,603
They say swordboatmen suffer from
a lack of dreams.

1202
01:55:08,687 --> 01:55:10,439
That's what begets their courage.

1203
01:55:12,447 --> 01:55:14,517
Well, we'll dream for you. . .

1204

1210
01:55:27,127 --> 01:55:28,765
Sleep well.

1211
01:55:29,247 --> 01:55:30,521
Good night.

1212
01:55:55,647 --> 01:55:57,205
I'll be asleep. . .

1213
01:55:57,407 --> 01:55:59,796
. . .and then all of a sudden,
there he is.

1214
01:56:01,327 --> 01:56:02,919
That big smile.

1215
01:56:03,127 --> 01:56:04,799
You know that smile.

1216
01:56:06,207 --> 01:56:09,040
And I say,
"Hey, Bobby, where you been?"

1217
01:56:09,767 --> 01:56:11,485
But he won't tell me.

1218
01:56:12,047 --> 01:56:14,515
He Just smiles and says:

1219
01:56:14,927 --> 01:56:17,839
"Remember I'll always love you,
Christina.

1220
01:56:18,247 --> 01:56:20,920
I love you now,
and I'll love you forever.

1221
01:56:21,487 --> 01:56:23,045
There's no goodbye.

1222
01:56:23,807 --> 01:56:25,206
Only love. "

1223
01:56:26,647 --> 01:56:28,160
And then he's gone.

1224
01:56:30,967 --> 01:56:33,322
But he's always happy when he goes.

1225
01:56:33,647 --> 01:56:36,878
So I know he's gotta be okay.

1226
01:56:38,087 --> 01:56:40,157
Absolutely okay.

1227
01:56:47,607 --> 01:56:49,438
I love your dream.

1228
01:56:58,407 --> 01:57:00,079
The fog's just lifting.

1229
01:57:00,727 --> 01:57:03,560
You throw off your bow line,
throw off your stern.

1230
01:57:03,847 --> 01:57:05,644
You head out the South Channel...

1231
01:57:05,847 --> 01:57:08,680
...past Rocky Neck,
Ten Pound lsland...

1232
01:57:08,887 --> 01:57:11,640
...past Niles Pond,
where I skated as a kid.

1233
01:57:12,327 --> 01:57:13,806
You blow your horn and wave to...

1234
01:57:14,007 --> 01:57:16,521
... the lighthouse keeper's kid
on Thatcher lsland.

1235
01:57:17,647 --> 01:57:19,399
Then the birds show up.

1236
01:57:19,727 --> 01:57:22,036
Black-backs and herring gulls...

1237
01:57:22,527 --> 01:57:23,801
...big dump ducks.

1238
01:57:24,407 --> 01:57:25,760
The sun hits you.

1239
01:57:25,967 --> 01:57:27,719
You head north, open up to 12.

1240
01:57:27,927 --> 01:57:29,406
You're steaming now.

1241
01:57:30,167 --> 01:57:32,601
The guys are busy,
you're in charge.

1242
01:57:33,327 --> 01:57:35,887
You know what+?
You're a goddamn swordboat captain.

1243
01:57:37,047 --> 01:57:39,003
Is there anything better in the world+?

1244
02:04:40,727 --> 02:04:41,716
