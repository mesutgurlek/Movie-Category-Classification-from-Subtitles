00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:07,040
lt might not be any of my business,

2
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,981
but JC's crew's headed this way
to bump you, and they all got shanks.

3
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,380

He kind of tight, too.

14
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:54,951
That shit don't mean nothing
round here though, player.

15
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:56,495
l've seen a whole lot of built motherfuckers

16
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:59,498

17
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:01,727
You understand what l'm telling you?

18
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:05,364
l'm talking to you, partner.

19
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:12,871
You got to the count of five.

20
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:16,839
-This motherfucker talking to me?
-One.

21
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:19,542
You hear this motherfucker?

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,345
Two.

23
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:25,585
-You hear this motherfucker?
-Three.

24
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,924
You just signed
your own death certificate, player.

25
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:31,654
Goddamn.

26
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:50,943
Shit.

27
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,553
l need you to deliver a message.

28
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:04,652
l want you to tell every motherfucker
behind these walls

29
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,564
that if they get the notion to fuck with me,

30
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:09,324
don't.

31
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:42,235
Man, you know it's hotter
than a motherfucker out here.

32
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:45,203
Then tell your mother to stick her fat ass
out the window and give us some shade.

33
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,206
Fuck you, nigga.

34
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:48,866
-Shit, here she comes.
-Hey!

35
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:50,000
Hi.

36
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:52,277
Are you tweaking? You all right?

37
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:53,369
Y'all holding?

38
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:56,244
-Yeah, what you think?
-Yeah, baby. You got some Swiss?

39
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,745
-Count this shit.
-Let me count that. Let me count that.

40
00:03:58,818 --> 00:03:59,807
-Make sure she does.
-Good?

41
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:02,548
All crinkled up and shit.
Yeah, give it to her.

42
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:03,680
Hey!

43
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:10,162
You all get off my block before l call
the police on your asses again.

44
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,393
Fuck you,
you old Fred Sanford-looking ass.

45
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:15,764
Yeah, yo. Take your ass back to TV Land,

46
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:18,736
you Nick-at-Nite-looking motherfucker.
Peace, homie.

47
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,383
Checkmate.

48
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:38,524
See, l told you l'm always thinking
three moves ahead.

49
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,158
Thanks, baby.

50
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:43,718
You know, this thinking generates heat.

51
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:02,344
Thank Jesus for the shade.

52
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:07,351
You looking for a room, mister?

53
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:08,710
Yeah.

54
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:11,280
Yeah, come on.

55
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:19,264
Hey, Tamara, there's a fellow here
looking for a room.

56
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:24,233
Jared, it's time for dinner, baby.

57
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:32,201
Can l help you?

58
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,574
Sign says ''Room for rent.''

59
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:42,987
lt may need a little airing out.

60
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:46,990
This is just fine.

61
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:50,562
You know, since l keep kids, l have rules.

62
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:55,394
No gangsters, no guns, no loud music

63
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:59,297
and no women in or out.

64
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:03,934
So this may not be the type of place
that you're looking for.

65
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:09,014
This seems like
just the kind of place l'm looking for.

66
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:12,981
So what's your name?

67
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,421
Call me Bone.

68
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,525
Well, Mr. Bone...

69
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:25,726
Ante up.

70
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:45,583
l'm not taking a chance on you, am l,
Mr. Bone?

71
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,142
No.

72
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:57,885
Bone.

73
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:51,941
Come on, big fella.

74
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:53,808
Yeah, baby.

75
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:00,886
Yeah, bust his fucking ass.

76
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:14,964
Dicks on the wall!

77
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:20,802
And the winner, coming straight from
the New York City penal system,

78
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,371
the homicidal homosexual,

79
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,110
the savage faggot,

80
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,415
the queer that inspires fear,

81
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,717
the butt-battling bandit,

82
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:32,857
Mommie Dearest!

83
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:36,422
Dicks on the walls, baby!

84
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:02,351
Here we go. You up next.

85
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:04,789
Hey, this is serious. This ain't no joke.

86
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:07,087
l'm ready.

87
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:21,031
Let's get this show on the road.

88
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,532
Yo. What up?

89
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:29,872
We got three to one.

90
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,327
Ladies and gentlemen,

91
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:51,870
niggas and bitches,

92
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:54,907
next up we got the man from
the Lone Star State,

93
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:58,137
the raging redneck, half man, half steer,

94
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:00,441
a shotgun and a bottle of beer, bitch.

95
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:04,279
This motherfucker,
this motherfucker right here's so raw,

96
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,444
he eats steaks directly off live bulls' asses.

97
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,648
l'm talking about the killer from
Dallas' grassy knoll.

98
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:15,126
Giddy-up, y'all, for the Cowboy!

99
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:18,725
Nigga better be on tonight,

00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:21,266
'cause he's going up against
the baddest of the bad.

101
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:25,866
Oh, yeah. l know you all know
what l'm talking about, right? Right?

102
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,772
l'm talking about the unholy combination

103
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:31,537
-from the Zulu nation.
-We got three to one.

104
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,271
Yeah, three to one.

105
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:36,814
You got 10 G on Hammer? All right.

106
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,877
We're in the pipe, baby. Five by five.

107
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,778
The Hammerman!

108
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,125
Okay, cuz, here we go.

That is a big motherfucker,
but you are faster, man.

110
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,789
You're way faster.
All you gotta do is stick and move,

111
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,857
stick and move, bob and weave,
like l told you.

112
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:57,027
Are you ready?

115
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:04,906
Dumbass motherfucker.

<i>K</i>nuckle up!

00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:50,655
And the winner, once again,

121
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:53,457
the Hammerman.

122
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,057
What can l say?

123
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:07,002
You've still got
one of the hardest hitters in the streets.

124
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:08,506
Tell me about it.

125
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,967
Well, ain't you gonna count it?

126
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:13,945
l trust you, Pinball.

127
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,943
Do l have a reason not to?

128
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,007
No.

129
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,746
Good.

130
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:29,150
Fuck.

131
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:40,694
Don't.

132
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:43,708
What the fuck you want?
What you want? My rims?

133
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:45,937
No, l don't want your rims.

134
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:47,945
Well, then, what the fuck?

135
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,712
l wanna fight with Hammerman.

136
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:53,013
Oh, yeah, and l wanna fuck Beyonce.

137
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,951
Looks like you need a new fighter.

138
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,221
So, you a fighter.

139
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,548
Yeah, you know what?

140
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,390
l could sling fifty cents of nickels
outside this car and hit ten fighters,

141
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:05,021
ain't one that can fuck with Hammerman.

142
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:07,089
What the fuck's so special about you?

143
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,726
Set me up a fight and l'll show you.

144
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:13,803
Well, first of all, it's gonna cost
at least 20 large to set up a fight.

145
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:16,171
Second, Hammer don't fuck with no scrubs.

146
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:18,039
You ain't got no name,
you ain't got nothing.

147
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:19,669
Who the fuck you think you are?

148
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,440
And third, you think
l'm gonna put up my own money

149
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:22,708
for a fighter l ain't never seen fight?

150
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:25,979
Shit, you must be smoking that
new kind of crack.

151
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:29,887
$260.

152
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:32,515
Get me a fight with anyone.

153
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:35,627
-What's in it for me?
-20% .

154
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:38,294
Use your own money, you get 40.

155
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:45,696
Yeah.

156
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:48,103
James, Franklin here.

157
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:52,167
l'd like you to pay
our old friend Darryl a visit tonight.

158
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:54,772

<i>-By the way, nice suit</i>

160
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:19,729
You out of here, James?

161
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:22,638
Yeah, a few things to take care of.
You know how it is.

162
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:32,707
You're looking kind of hard there,
ain't you, family?

163
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,610
Hard not to.

164
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:38,415
Yeah.

165
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:42,588
Angela.

166
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:07,341
James, you ain't met my new fighter
yet, huh? This is...

167
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,854
What the fuck they call you, anyway?

168
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,220
-Bone.
-Bone. Bone.

169
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:15,252
l call him Bone because
that's what he breaking when he hits.

170
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:17,489
ln your ass, little Asian Liberace.

171
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:34,168
Teddy.

172
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:36,571
Boys, let's break it up.

173
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:40,781
Let me give you a piece of advice.

174
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:42,821
You'd just as soon
glue mouse ears to your balls

175
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:44,617
and dangle them
in front of an angry alley cat

176
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,359
than fuck with that girl.

177
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:49,092
What?

178
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:51,823
Don't you ever do that again.

179
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:55,229
-What?
-Don't pretend like you don't know.

180
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:56,694
What?

181
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:01,365
Say ''what'' one more time.

182
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:05,444
Say ''what'' one more time
like you don't know.

183
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:10,741
What the fuck do you mean?

184
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,748
James, where we going?

185
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:20,686
Darryl's.

186
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:25,222
You all wanna go to Darryl's?

187
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:28,463
l hear Shelly's cooking.

188
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,072
Take her home.

189
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:38,174
Let's roll, let's roll.
Come on, Angela, let's go.

190
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:55,084
Man, l got $260. l got $260.
Give me ten to one.

191
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,651
-No, baby, no, baby. Five to one.
-Come on.

192
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,993
-Five to one.
-Huh? You killing me, D.

193
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:01,590
That's the best odds you're gonna get
for a scrub.

194
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,898
All right then. Let's do this.
Five to one, and that suit.

195
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,370
Hey, yo, gather round.
Gather round, everybody.

196
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,930
We got one more matchup tonight.

197
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:11,533
Gather round
because there's a new kid in town.

198
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,443
Y'all didn't know,
he was sent to serve somebody.

199
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:22,311
Yo, Big L, you ready?

200
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,455
Big L, whoop his ass!

201
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:29,956
Yeah, baby, break a bone, baby.
Break a bone.

202
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:31,257
All right, then.

203
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,723
<i>K</i>nuckle up!

204
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:58,251
Yo, Deke,
give me that motherfucking money...

205
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:04,262
We gonna make some money.
You and me, baby.

206
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,355
You and me, partner. No doubt.

207
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:09,560
l'm fucking getting this shit all together.
We're gonna start outside of town, right?

208
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:12,069
A few little fights, here and there.
You just gonna whoop some ass.

209
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:14,368
We're gonna stack our Swiss up just enough

210
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,499
that these greedy motherfuckers
around here don't know what's up.

211
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:17,735
Then we go straight for James.

212
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,438
Man, fuck that motherfucker,
we're going straight for James

213
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:22,481
'cause James is the real money around here.

214
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:24,914
Boy, you gotta treat
that psycho-ass nigga just right.

215
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:28,078
'Cause that motherfucker will kill your ass
just as much as talk to you.

216
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:30,315
But we gotta fuck with him just right.

217
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:33,790
Take it out of here just enough
so we get the odds that we want.

218
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:37,295
Then we drop that motherfucker down.
But, fuck, you know he got Hammerman.

219
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:38,660
But Hammerman ain't never put down.

220
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:42,667
That's when your ass comes in.
You gotta whoop that motherfucker's ass!

221
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:44,032
Yeah!

222
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:49,765
What can you tell me about the girl?

223
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:54,137
Fuck that. Hell no, no. No.

224
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:56,511
Get that shit out your head right now, man.
Fuck that.

225
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:58,914
You need to sit right there and have
a long, introspective conversation

226
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:01,316
-with your dick there, homes.
-Tell me about the girl.

227
00:19:01,387 --> 00:19:04,823
She's James's girl.
That's all the fuck you need to know.

228
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:09,958
Fuck me.

229
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:14,826
Angela Soto. All right, that's her name.

230
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,798
<i>James turned her real bad</i>

231
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,772
<i>She was married, matter of fact,</i>
<i>to a man, a choirboy</i>

232
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:23,534
<i>I forget his name</i>

233
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:25,274
Word on the street is,

234
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:29,280
James set him up, triple homicide,
sent his black ass to jail.

235
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:31,875
<i>James just swooped in,</i>
<i>snatched the girl for himself</i>

236
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,441
<i>But the fucked up thing is,</i>

237
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,248
l heard she was pregnant.

238
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:38,982
This motherfucker took her to a clinic
and got that baby...

239
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,525
After that,

240
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:43,924
she got hooked on the horse
and that's the end of that sordid tale.

241
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:46,226
Don't you ever tell me
to tell you that story again because

242
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:50,257
that's the type of shit that make a brother
lose all hope in humanity and shit.

243
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,133
You know what l'm saying?

244
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:53,193
Yeah.

245
00:19:56,942 --> 00:20:00,139
So this guy, first time up, first hole,

246
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:02,203
first game, he swears,

247
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:05,041
par five, shoots an eagle.

248
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,051
An eagle, first try!

249
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,412
-Couldn't believe it.
-Wait. That reminds me, Darryl,

250
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,353
you get that thing off to Franklin?

251
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:14,119
Franklin, dude,
don't even worry about that guy.

252
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,664
We could have some music.

253
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:20,926
-Yes.
-Good idea.

254
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,025
-Well, l'll get it, baby.
-Okay, okay.

255
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:26,001
Yeah, l'm usually shooting like a 79, 80.

256
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:28,539
This guy, 72, first game.

257
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:38,005
A little white-boy music to aid digestion?

258
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:41,916
What's wrong, you don't think that
brothers are down with Wang Chung?

259
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:44,217
<i>Take your baby by the hand</i>

260
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,951
See, he knows it.

don't take this personal.

274
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,489
What?

275
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:32,564
-Get over here!

What good are you anymore?

You ain't nothing but a junkie.

281
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,468
What is the music on that thing?

282
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:55,308
lt's a new joint, man.

283
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,781
By what's-his-name, you know,
the cat does the song, <i>Homegirl</i>

284
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:02,218
Yeah, well turn it off.
You know l don't like profanity in my home.

My bad. lt's off.

What is that thing anyway?

That, man, is the P<i>K</i>L 370.

288
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:10,926
Better known as the Pickle.

289
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:14,625
And check it. lf l call you up,
all you gotta do is press star 40,

290
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:19,163
and it automatically activates a GPS
that can find you anywhere by satellite.

291

lt's tight, huh?

292
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:24,197

One kick.

Folded up Big Lamont like a paper bag.

297

Where's he from?

298
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:47,494
Only cat that knows is Pinball.

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,489
Okay.

300
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:57,608
Here's my boy.

Sorry?

309
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:22,898
Just saying,
they're looking at me like Chinese takeout.

310
00:25:22,968 --> 00:25:25,732
lt's because you don't know
how to treat them.

311
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:30,974
Just like everything else, you just gotta
show them who their master is.

312
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:32,237
You ready?

313

For what?

Just tell me if you're ready.

Get them motherfucking dogs
away from me, man.

319
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:44,678
Stop.

320
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:49,220
What did l tell you about cursing?

321
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:55,124
Remember, profanity is a brutal vice.
He that uses it is no gentleman.

322
00:25:58,403 --> 00:26:01,861
l gotta warn you,
l'm always thinking three moves ahead.

323
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:08,705
-He's looking fresh today.
-Yeah, yeah, with his church shoes on.

324
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,145
Yeah, l mean, he likes this bike, right?

325
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,512
-l know you feeling it.
-See this?

326
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,107
-You see the bling?
-Bling, bling, bling.

327
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:15,745
You want that, right? You want that.
A fiend for that.

328
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:19,052
Jared! Get your little behind up here
right now.

329
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:24,223
Hey! You two good-for-nothings,
take that... Get off this block!

330
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:25,490
Man, fuck you,

331
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:28,055
you gray-haired,
Grandpa Moses-looking motherfucker.

332
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,431
You Metamucil-drinking-ass motherfucker.

333
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:33,137
You don't want me to come down there,
do you?

334
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:38,704
All right.

335
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,411
lt's all in the tone of your voice.

336
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:48,953
That's how you get things done around here.

337
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:51,016
Hey, yo, Bone!

338
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,818
Time to go, partner.

339
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:54,817
That's checkmate.

340
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,155
What? Checkmate?

341
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:58,162
l play four moves ahead.

342
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:08,695
Here.

343
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,599
Damn.

344
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:18,309
l'm not sure l approve
of the company you keep, Mr. Bone.

345
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,084
Me, neither.

346
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:36,623
Hey.

347
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,300
You know <i>Car Wash</i> is not just a movie.

348
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:44,699
This may seem like some old
underground fight club shit, low-key and all.

349
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:46,767
These motherfuckers can scrap, though.

350
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:56,784
You see that chick? l used to hit that.

351
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:58,447
Pretty hot for a fighter, huh?

352
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:05,020
Not anymore.

353
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:06,655
Shit.

354
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:12,697
And the winner is,

355
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:16,197
the vindictive Veretta Vendetta!

356
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:18,400
Don't get on her bad side, homies.

357
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:19,842
That's fucking right.

358
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:30,311
Tatt, what up?

359
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:31,917
-What's up, man?
-Chilling.

360
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:36,791
So, check this out. l got this new fighter.
l'll bet you $5000, what you think?

361
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:39,160
-Who?
-That man right there, Bone.

362
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:41,889
l'm talking about your best fighter
right now. Five G's.

363
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,992
-My best fighter?
-Your best fighter.

364
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:45,263
-All right, man.
-All right?

365
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,668
-Yeah.
-Five G's?

366
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:48,035
All right.

367
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:53,938
Okay, we got the next fight.

368
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,773
Over here we got this guy, Bone.

369
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,183
He seems to think he can come here
and take all our money.

370
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:06,657
But tonight, he's gotta put it all up
against the man with the golden grill.

371
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:10,792
Yeah. Now we already seen
what he does to a dude that he likes.

372
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:14,389
And l don't think he likes
this guy Bone very much, does he?

373
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:19,293
Okay. You guys ready?

374
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:21,861
Fight!

375
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,108
Holy shit.

376
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:32,514
What technique! What technique!

377
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,745
You ever see some shit like that?
l never seen no shit like that.

378
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,653
My man Bone will wreck shop
on your punk-ass fighters, man.

379
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:40,054
Two at a time, bitches! Two at a time!

380
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,820
-Pay me, Tattoo. Pay me.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

381
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:43,656
What'd you say, two at a time?

382
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:44,956
ls that what you said, two?

383
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,464
Hey, everybody heard that?
Two at a time, okay?

384
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:50,524
-That's the bet. Two at a time.
-No, no, no, no, what bet? What bet?

385
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:51,591
Hey, hey, calm down, homie.

386
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,797
That's what you just said,
two at a time, right?

387
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,134
Hey, Carlos, Manuel.

388
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:57,198
Hold on. No, no, wait.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

389
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:59,243
You said two at a time.

390
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:01,506
-What, you scared? You gonna forfeit?
-Fuck that, man. Fuck you!

391
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,911
Fuck you, homie.

392
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,243
Fuck you.

393
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:08,018
Your man as good as he says he is?
Let's do it.

394
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:10,714
-This is bullshit.
-Double or nothing.

395
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:14,054
No, no, no. Bone, Bone,
he owes us money right the fuck now!

396
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:15,650
Double or nothing.

397
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:19,925
Double or nothing.
Get this motherfucker, man.

398
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:45,245
What the fuck?

399
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,793
That's double.

400
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:52,261
-Wanna double up again?
-Hey, hey, hey.

401
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:55,662
David, Jesus, Lorenzo,
get this motherfucker, man.

402
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:05,842
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?

403
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:10,143
One, two, three!
<i>Uno, dos, tres,</i> homes, just like that. What?

404
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,518
First bet was $5000.

405
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:15,610
Double or nothing on the second made it 10.

406
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:17,216
No fucking way, homie.

407
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:19,348
-Double that made it 20.
-Hey.

408
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,549
-Hey!
-You wanna triple?

409
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,685
Hell no, motherfucker. Hell no!

410
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:25,662
Hey, you said this motherfucker
was a beginner.

411
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,129
You said he just got started, homie.

412
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,530
You said this motherfucker
was a beginner, homie.

413
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,158
-No. No, you took the bet.
-l ain't having it, man.

414
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:31,702
You took the action. Time to pay up!

415
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,897
You want your money, homie?
You want your money?

416
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:36,600
Give me the fucking money, man.
You want your money? You see it?

417
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,302
lt's right here, baby.

418
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:40,310
Come and get it.

419
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:43,380
What, motherfucker? Come and get it.

420
00:31:43,982 --> 00:31:46,951
Pussies. These pussy motherfuckers, man.

421
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:48,683
-Right here.
-What the...

422
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,243
Right here. What?

423
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:51,411
Right there!

424
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,900
What now? You all weren't expecting
no superhero shit like that, huh?

425
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:26,546
Call me.

426
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:35,361
Goddamn.

427
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,960
You just took out the whole village.
The whole fucking village.

428
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,170
You know where that's been, right?

429
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:45,869
Goddamn, you are one crazy son of a bitch.

430
00:32:45,944 --> 00:32:48,344
l never met no crazy motherfucker like you.
You know what l'm saying?

431
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:51,109
This motherfucker won't... Oh, shit!

432
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:55,312
Pussy motherfuckers, where you going?

433
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:57,555
Motherfuckers!

434
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,931
Ante up.

435
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,525
Break his hand.

436
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:58,402
Come on, break them off, man.
Break them off.

437
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:08,985
Get the money.

438
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:27,599
Man,

439
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:31,170
my whole life
motherfuckers played me for a mark.

440
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,108
Act like l'm some kind of punk.

441
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:36,579
lnside, l always felt like a baller

442
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:39,515
even though my pockets were flat.

443
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:42,380
And now it's all coming true.

444
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:44,251
And it's all because of you, B.

445
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,749
So what l'm trying to say is,

446
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,920
l love you, B.

447
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:58,429
l don't mean that in a homosexual,
l'm-trying-to-get-with-you kind of way.

448
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:00,130
l mean that in like...

449
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:02,338
Like a motherfucker who, now,

450
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:03,965
he-got-a-ride-to-match-his-rims
kind of way.

451
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:06,442
You know what l'm saying? That's love.

452
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:12,215
Damn. That was way mellow and shit.

453
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,788
What happened to you?

454
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:27,458
l had an accident.

455
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:30,057
What did you do,
trip and fall on someone's fist?

456
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:31,465
Come here.

457
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,434
Come here.

458
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:36,667
Sit down.

459
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:50,651
Are you always up this early?

460
00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:54,158
Yes. To make breakfast for the children.

461
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:59,428
You take good care of those kids.

462
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:04,558
Yeah, well, l do what l have to do to
stop them from being killers, thugs, hos,

463
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:06,302
street fighters.

464
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:12,837
You have any family, Mr. Bone?

465
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,370
Long time ago.

466
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:20,183
What happened?

467
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:25,351
So, how long you been
taking care of the kids?

468
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,785
Well...

469
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:32,295
Angel l've had for three years,

470
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:35,932
Regina, about a year and a half,

471
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:39,703
and Jared, about a year.

472
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:44,273
Why does Jared
always stand at the window?

473
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:49,837
He's waiting for his folks to come back.

474
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:57,119
As far as l know, his father's in jail.

475
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:01,457
But he does have a mother
out there somewhere.

476
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:08,829
Thank you.

477
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:14,838
You know l saw you doing tai chi out there.

478
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:21,003
l watch the old people do it in the park,
you know?

479
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:28,852
lt just always looks so beautiful,
so relaxing.

480
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:33,754
Come here.

481
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:40,188
Let me show you something.

482
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:46,025
Okay.

483
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:50,500
This is tai chi. This is called Push Hands.

484
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,367
Step with your right foot.

485
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:55,602
Put your hand here.

486
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:59,681
Now, this hand goes on my elbow.

487
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:03,487
Now, this is called Push Hands.

488
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:06,250
When l push, you yield,

489
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:09,959
roll back and push me.

490
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:12,594
Just like that.

491
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:15,494
And push with your hand.

492
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:18,096
And roll back.

493
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:21,127
There you go.

494
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:08,911
Checkmate.

495
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:23,899
Five moves ahead, young'un.

496
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:40,475
Shit!

497
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:44,245
Why you running?

498
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:46,214
You know you're gonna twist an ankle.

499
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,191
l didn't do it, James. l swear l didn't do it.

500
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,194
Do what? Why are you running?

501
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:55,426
'Cause l know he told you what you
think l did, but l didn't do it, James.

502
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:58,559
l swear.
l put that on my babies, James, please.

503
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:01,036
Then why don't you stop running
and tell me your side?

504
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:03,733
'Cause ain't nobody got no other side
with you, James!

505
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:05,867
You think l'm that one-sided?
l'm that one-sided?

506
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:08,104
Monique, l am hurt. l am hurt.

507
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:10,270
Will you stop climbing that fence?

508
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:12,873
You are giving me a complex over here.

509
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:15,784
You know what?

510
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,835
Man, James.

511
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:35,367
-She's messed up.
-Now l feel bad.

512
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:05,559
Come on, let's go.

513
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,742
Shit.

514
00:42:17,982 --> 00:42:20,507
<i>K</i>ind of motherfucking name is Bone?

515
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:23,043
He's about to get boned by the Hammer.

516
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:25,715
<i>K</i>now what l'm saying?

517
00:42:30,394 --> 00:42:32,328
-You ready for this?
-Yeah.

518
00:42:32,396 --> 00:42:33,556
Hold steady.

519
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:36,526
Just knock this motherfucker out.

520
00:42:37,201 --> 00:42:40,398
Afterwards, we'll get those little schoolgirls.
You know what l'm saying?

521
00:42:40,471 --> 00:42:42,564
You ready for this, Hammer? You ready?

522
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,164
-Yeah!
-Let's do this!

523
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,142
Let do this! l don't smell no Hammer.

524
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,041
l smell pussy! Are you a pussy?

525
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:49,670
No! No! You're the Hammerman!

526
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:50,975
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Yeah!

527
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:53,779
What's up, James? How you doing, fam?

528
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:55,375
Got your money?

529
00:42:57,855 --> 00:43:01,086
Well, there it is, just waiting for you
to give it a little company.

530
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:02,682
You need to count it?

531
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:08,630
Bring him up.

532
00:43:11,102 --> 00:43:15,163
Step to the rear,
'cause the Hammer is here! Yeah!

533
00:43:16,707 --> 00:43:19,835
You know that thing you always say
every time l fight?

534
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:21,970
What? You mean,

535
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:24,776
''They call him Bone because
that's what he break when he hits''?

536
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:27,215
-Yeah.
-Don't say that.

537
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:31,817
All right motherfuckers
and motherfuckettes,

538
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:33,413
it's time for the main event.

539
00:43:33,491 --> 00:43:37,518
Now, without further ado,
let me bring to you,

540
00:43:37,595 --> 00:43:39,825
coming straight from Skull lsland.

541
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:41,990
Y'all might know him
from his numerous appearances

542
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:43,966
atop the Empire State Building,

543
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:46,128
swatting down airplanes and shit,

544
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:48,671
the primate from another climate,

545
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:51,572
the Hammerman!

546
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:54,535
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

547
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:57,612
But now, coming from this corner,

548
00:43:57,682 --> 00:44:00,549
he's new on the scene,
but he's stacking much green.

549
00:44:00,618 --> 00:44:02,677
The one-technique knockout artist

550
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:06,086
who's breaking down pros
like they just got started.

551
00:44:06,157 --> 00:44:08,216
The brother man with death in each hand,

552
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:10,817
the man they call Bone, because...

553
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:14,924
Because that's what his parents named him.

554
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:16,466
Bone!

555
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:20,296
And now, you hedonistic savages,

556
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:22,269
knuckle up!

557
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:40,450
Come on, baby.

558
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:58,230
Shit.

559
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:01,202
Shit.

560
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:03,769
Tastes like a Timberland boot, bitch.

561
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:32,440
The man Bone! The winner is my man Bone!

562
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,308
Yo, Hammy, he just took
your juiced-up ass to college.

563
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:36,676
Bone, bitches.

564
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:39,212
Yeah, yeah, no, get the money, right.
Get the money.

565
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:42,081
That's the deal. Get the money, bitches.

566
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:44,815
That motherfucker Bones is the truth.

567
00:45:47,558 --> 00:45:51,187
What can l say, James?
Homeboy just got lucky.

568
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:54,197
Yeah, well, like they say,

569
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:56,657
every dog has its day.

570
00:45:57,902 --> 00:46:00,063
This is yours, l guess.

571
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,878
Watch his leg.

572
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:15,043
My leg, man.

573
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:18,555
-lt's just my leg.
-Put no weight on it.

574
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,750
Take it.

575
00:46:31,368 --> 00:46:34,701
Mr. Bone, that was one hell of a show.

576
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:40,367
l never seen anything like that
before in my life.

577
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:44,008
You know, you cost me a lot of money.

578
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:45,844
l hear you got a lot.

579
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:48,145
Not really.

580
00:46:48,919 --> 00:46:55,415
You know, why don't you and Pinball
come by my place, celebrate?

581
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:58,122
That way we can talk.

582
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:00,823
l'm sorry, James, we got some plans.

583
00:47:01,365 --> 00:47:02,696
We'll be there.

584
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:05,162
Good.

585
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:12,702
You know, invincibility lies in defense.

586
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,804
Possibility of victory in the attack.

587
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,088
You ain't got no qualm with the Asiatic.

588
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:33,256
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

589
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:35,931
Glad you two could make it.

590
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,763
Well, l didn't think you'd want to see us
after we won that money from you tonight.

591
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:42,169
Well, l guess it had to happen
sooner or later.

592
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:44,969
Didn't know you had a secret weapon.

593
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:48,901
Poor, old Hammer's at the hospital
straightening out his knee.

594
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,274
Hey, baby, come meet my man, Bone.

595
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,541
He just whooped the Hammerman.

596
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:05,993
Words can't describe
how little l give a damn.

597
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:24,336
Come, come, walk with me. Talk.

598
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:29,648
Where'd you learn how to fight?

599
00:48:30,421 --> 00:48:31,752
Here and there.

600
00:48:32,456 --> 00:48:33,684
Here and there.

601
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:38,520
l got something to show you.

602
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:44,599
l've always admired fighters
and the fight game.

603
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:48,033
A warrior's life, that's the life for me.

604
00:48:48,105 --> 00:48:50,471
There's honor and virtue.

605
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:54,403
A warrior's life must be pure in body
and in spirit.

606
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:57,845
That's why l don't drink,
l don't smoke, l don't use profanity.

607
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:01,908
Genghis <i>K</i>han once said,
the greatest pleasure

608
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:05,944
is to vanquish your enemies
and chase them before you,

609
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:11,257
to rob them of their wealth
and to have those dear to them

610
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:13,423
bathed in tears.

611
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:20,466
l am the punishment of God.

612
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:24,407
And if you had not committed great sins,

613
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:27,638
God would not have sent a punishment
like me upon you.

614
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:30,907
Genghis <i>K</i>han.

615
00:49:33,284 --> 00:49:34,581
You see?

616
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:39,848
l am not like the rest of those thugs
you see out there

617
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:44,690
smoking blunts and playing video games,
and neither are you.

618
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:47,663
l could see that right off.

619
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:50,196
Do you train with weapons?

620
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:53,025
Catch.

621
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:57,234
Hey, hey, hey.

622
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:01,440
Now, l guess you're thinking,

623
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:08,181
what does this street hustler know
about honor and nobility?

624
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:13,455
Well, the truth of the matter is,
not very much.

625
00:50:14,325 --> 00:50:15,849
But l am learning.

626
00:50:17,161 --> 00:50:19,186
l have a path, l have a vision, l have a plan

627
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,198
that l would very much like you
to be a part of.

628
00:50:24,234 --> 00:50:25,223
How so?

629
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:28,099
lnternational underground street fighting
is by far

630
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:32,302
the biggest moneymaking
fight game, period.

631
00:50:33,277 --> 00:50:36,246
lt is the pastime for a group of fat cats

632
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:39,771
who like to call themselves The Consortium.

633
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:43,308
This is the game
that l am trying to get into.

634
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:48,290
You got an in?

635
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:51,594
You ever hear of a man
called Franklin McVeigh?

636
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:52,686
No.

637
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:57,427
Franklin McVeigh is
an international arms dealer. Large.

638
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:01,938
lf there's a war in this world, that fool
is probably providing the party favors.

639
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:05,799
But he wasn't always this big.
He was a small-time thug from London,

640
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:07,844
selling pop guns
to the little black and brown kids

641
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:08,935
on the streets of America.

642
00:51:09,012 --> 00:51:11,606
Needless to say, that is where l met him.

643
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:13,710
Anyway,

644
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:19,312
Franklin McVeigh runs the international
fight game for The Consortium.

645
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:24,149
And he manages
the best fighter in the world.

646
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:30,364
<i>They call him Pretty Boy Price</i>

647
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:31,799
<i>Now, don't let his looks fool you</i>

648
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:34,531
<i>He has already killed four men in the ring</i>

649
00:51:36,106 --> 00:51:39,906
Pound for pound, he's considered
the best fighter in the world.

650
00:51:42,012 --> 00:51:45,846
lt costs five million dollars
to get in the ring with him.

651
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:52,479
Now, ordinarily, you would have to
work your way up the ranks

652
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:55,691
to get a fight with Price.

653
00:51:56,994 --> 00:51:58,461
But McVeigh owes me.

654
00:52:00,731 --> 00:52:05,395
l wanna do to Franklin McVeigh
what you and Pinball did to me.

655
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,131
You beat Price,

656
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:11,171
you can retire a very rich man.

657
00:52:12,576 --> 00:52:14,168
l'll think about it.

658
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:16,178
What is there to think about?

659
00:52:17,815 --> 00:52:20,682
Like l said, l'll think about it.

660
00:52:21,685 --> 00:52:24,279
Okay, my friend. You do that.

661
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:27,318
But you should know

662
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:32,026
l don't like people that say no to me.

663
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:35,331
Maybe you should get used to it.

664
00:53:16,874 --> 00:53:19,001
This what you're looking for?

665
00:53:22,012 --> 00:53:23,070
No.

666
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:25,341
l need you to do something for me first.

667
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:29,216
Come with me.

668
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:32,919
What now?

669
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:43,726
Do you see that man
that you keep looking at?

670
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:49,897
l want you...

671
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:56,913
Fuck you and the mule you rode in on.

672
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,973
Hey! What'd l tell you about that language?

673
00:54:01,251 --> 00:54:02,878
Fuck you.

674
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:05,482
Come here.

675
00:54:13,397 --> 00:54:15,695
Do you know what l can do to you?

676
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:19,259
Look at me.

677
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,664
No, really, look at me.

678
00:54:27,878 --> 00:54:30,506
Now, you know what l'm capable of, right?

679
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:36,318
And you know

680
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:39,884
that l'll do it, too.

681
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,033
<i>So why don't you go over there</i>

682
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:57,663
<i>and do what I told you to do?</i>

683
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,074
Come with me.

684
00:55:32,976 --> 00:55:36,742
''Take care of my wife and my kid.''

685
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:40,678
That's what he told me.

686
00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:45,116
That's the last thing he said before he died.

687
00:55:47,324 --> 00:55:48,416
Who?

688
00:55:53,797 --> 00:55:55,355
Who do you think?

689
00:56:02,673 --> 00:56:03,833
Danny.

690
00:56:34,604 --> 00:56:36,265
You knew Danny?

691
00:56:39,609 --> 00:56:41,042
How?

692
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:42,510
ln prison.

693
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:46,872
<i>He was my friend</i>

694
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:52,780
Well, sorry to do this to you, but...

695
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:55,788
Checkmate.

696
00:56:58,361 --> 00:56:59,487
Man.

697
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:03,796
Hey, check this out, man.

698
00:57:09,406 --> 00:57:11,738
lt's a beautiful picture, man.

699
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:13,465
That's my family.

700
00:57:14,444 --> 00:57:16,139
My wife and my son.

701
00:57:16,947 --> 00:57:20,144
Never got a chance to meet him,
but l'm gonna see him soon.

702
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:29,318
You know, you remind me of my brother.

703
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:31,587
Really? You have a brother?

704
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:34,020
Had a brother.

705
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:35,325
A twin.

706
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:39,263
What happened to him?

707
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:43,200
Somebody killed him.

708
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:45,802
Thought he was me.

709
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:56,109
Some chess.

710
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:02,717
Come here.

711
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:07,723
All inmates to their cells, now!

712
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:09,459
-Go!
-Lock it down, lock it down.

713
00:58:09,533 --> 00:58:10,966
Back in your cells!

714
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:20,237
Come here.

715
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:23,745
Tell me something.

716
00:58:23,814 --> 00:58:25,406
ls this the woman that Danny cried over

717
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:28,451
and begged me to look after
as he was dying?

718
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:30,478
Danny.

719
00:58:31,388 --> 00:58:33,652
Did you forget you had a son?

720
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:35,315
Don't you judge me.

721
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:37,451
Don't you fucking judge me!

722
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:42,697
The whole reason l'm in this shit
is because of Danny and my son.

723
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:46,629
l knew James set him up to get to me.

724
00:58:48,972 --> 00:58:51,805
l also knew that if he couldn't have me,

725
00:58:56,146 --> 00:58:58,637
he would've killed Danny and my son.

726
00:59:19,236 --> 00:59:22,433
l always hoped he'd get tired of me
and let me go.

727
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:25,202
l could find my son.

728
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,344
But that's all just a pipe dream.

729
00:59:31,181 --> 00:59:33,445
l don't know where my son is.

730
00:59:35,285 --> 00:59:37,446
l don't even know if he's alive.

731
00:59:46,229 --> 00:59:48,754
Your son is alive and l know where he is.

732
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:53,732
So let's get you cleaned up
and go get your son.

733
00:59:57,641 --> 01:00:00,405
So that's what
this whole thing is about, huh?

734
01:00:04,147 --> 01:00:07,412
You're my white knight here
to save me from the tower?

735
01:00:08,685 --> 01:00:11,415
Well, l don't know about white knight.

736
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:20,786
Okay, just play along, smile,
act like we just had a good time.

737
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:25,323
That's good.

738
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:30,128
So?

739
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:36,673
So l think l'm gonna like this organization.

740
01:00:40,317 --> 01:00:42,683
You don't look any worse for wear.

741
01:00:43,453 --> 01:00:44,920
Why should l?

742
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:49,856
lt feels good to make love to a real man.

743
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:54,992
Hey, listen.

744
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:57,757
lf you're tired of her,

745
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:02,427
why don't you let me take her off
your hands for a while?

746
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:10,211
Well, l might consider to do that.

747
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:14,008
Depends upon
what you're willing to do for me.

748
01:01:14,617 --> 01:01:16,175
What you think?

749
01:01:20,156 --> 01:01:22,181
Get your stuff together.

750
01:01:23,693 --> 01:01:26,093
You're going with Bone for a while.

751
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:30,197
And don't forget your medicine.

752
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:47,909
So we'll talk about this later, right?

753
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:52,052
All right?

754
01:02:02,766 --> 01:02:04,700
Where are you taking me?

755
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:09,094
Someplace where you can
get yourself back together.

756
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:11,638
Okay.

757
01:02:14,778 --> 01:02:16,109
So, what's up?

758
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:20,473
See all that?

759
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:24,978
All that is mine.

760
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:28,551
Every block, every sidewalk, every alley.

761
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:36,431
lt's all so

762
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:40,131
dark and unsophisticated.

763
01:02:40,203 --> 01:02:43,070
lt is not where l wanna be anymore.

764
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:49,271
-lt's anonymous, right?
-Absolutely, sir.

765
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:54,138
We're good.

766
01:02:55,185 --> 01:02:58,245
What about my son? l want to see my son.

767
01:02:58,688 --> 01:03:00,553
Not till you're straight.

768
01:03:03,993 --> 01:03:05,551
This way, miss.

769
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:10,188
Bone.

770
01:03:13,169 --> 01:03:14,500
Thank you.

771
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:58,607
Good to see you, James.
You should visit more often.

772
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:02,444
-l hear you've become quite the golfer.
-Yes.

773
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:06,414
But unfortunately,
l just lost my golfing partner.

774
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:09,981
You, my friend,
should learn the fine art of subtlety.

775
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:14,096
So what do l owe the pleasure of this visit?

776
01:04:19,903 --> 01:04:21,632
Five million dollars.

777
01:04:22,105 --> 01:04:23,538
What's this for?

778
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:27,040
l want a fight with your pretty boy.

779
01:04:27,844 --> 01:04:31,336
So we're looking to sit
at the grownups' table, are we?

780
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:33,306
l have a fighter.

781
01:04:35,018 --> 01:04:36,952
This guy's the real deal.

782
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,578
You're not talking about Hammerman,
are you?

783
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,486
He's not even in Price's league.

784
01:04:40,557 --> 01:04:43,651
No, this is a new guy. Best l've ever seen.

785
01:04:43,726 --> 01:04:45,455
And l've seen Price.

786
01:04:45,762 --> 01:04:48,060
Well, it's not as simple as that, James.

787
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:51,931
The Consortium
is owned by a private organization.

788
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:55,698
All newcomers have to be agreed upon
by committee.

789
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:57,399
Come on, Franklin.

790
01:04:58,841 --> 01:05:01,969
After all l've done for you,
you couldn't do me this one little thing?

791
01:05:02,045 --> 01:05:04,707
You're asking me to vouch for you.

792
01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:09,679
Well, the funny thing about vouching for
someone, James,

793
01:05:09,752 --> 01:05:11,913
is that when that someone
shows themselves

794
01:05:11,988 --> 01:05:14,218
to be less than what was promised,

795
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:18,056
every decision you take from that point
on is second-guessed.

796
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:21,263
And that, in my line of work,

797
01:05:21,598 --> 01:05:23,065
is suicide.

798
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:28,998
Besides, why does a cool,
mellow fellow like yourself

799
01:05:29,072 --> 01:05:33,532
want to hang around with a bunch of
stuffy, old white guys?

800
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:37,512
Same reason you wanna hang around
those stuffy, old white guys.

801
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:39,070
Power.

802
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:40,738
Connections.

803
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:42,409
But let's keep it real.

804
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:45,281
l'm just a cool, mellow fellow,

805
01:05:45,922 --> 01:05:47,890
just shucking and jiving,

806
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:51,954
crip-walking, basketball-playing,
singing and dancing

807
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:54,553
and taking out your garbage.

808
01:05:55,698 --> 01:05:58,462
That's what l am to you.

809
01:05:59,736 --> 01:06:01,101
You're right.

810
01:06:01,404 --> 01:06:05,500
You are African-American.

811
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:09,439
And myself and my friends,
for the most part,

812
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:14,241
don't care for the company
of African-Americans.

813
01:06:14,851 --> 01:06:18,480
Quite frankly, we're entertained by you.

814
01:06:18,855 --> 01:06:23,053
We're thrilled by your high-flying acrobatics
on the basketball court,

815
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:26,453
that wonderful sense of rhythm you have,

816
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:29,327
your animal athleticism.

817
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,089
But apart from that,

818
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:34,133
we have no use for you.

819
01:06:34,837 --> 01:06:36,168
Understand?

820
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:41,770
l mean, let's face it, James.

821
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:47,081
Do you set a place at your dinner table
for your pit bulls?

822
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:51,711
Now, is this keeping it real enough for you?

823
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:58,450
l have another theory on this subject matter
and it goes something like this.

824
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:00,654
l imagine several hundred years ago,

825
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:04,029
a group of very powerful men,
not unlike yourself,

826
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,591
were out conquering the known world.

827
01:07:07,103 --> 01:07:08,798
So they get to Africa,

828
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:10,202
feeling pretty good about themselves,

829
01:07:10,273 --> 01:07:15,233
definitely feeling superior to the savages
they see running in the jungle.

830
01:07:16,145 --> 01:07:20,411
That is, until one of the brothers
drops his loincloth.

831
01:07:22,452 --> 01:07:25,615
And then these powerful men
all of a sudden

832
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:28,646
come face to face, so to speak,

833
01:07:29,092 --> 01:07:31,822
with one of life's great inequities.

834
01:07:33,396 --> 01:07:37,799
Let's whip them out and l'll settle
that myth right here and now.

835
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:39,798
Let's go.

836
01:07:43,673 --> 01:07:45,231
Okay, my friend.

837
01:07:45,842 --> 01:07:48,709
l'll stick my neck out and vouch for you.

838
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:53,006
But if you let me down in front of my people,

839
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:58,416
life will become very lonely for you
out there on those streets.

840
01:08:00,757 --> 01:08:02,054
Am l clear?

841
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,493
Clear as water.

842
01:08:07,597 --> 01:08:11,658
l'm hosting a retreat for Consortium
members over the next three days.

843
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:14,032
Have your man ready in two.

844
01:08:15,705 --> 01:08:17,263
He'll be ready.

845
01:08:29,452 --> 01:08:30,441
Wait.

846
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,712
l know this man.

847
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:34,313
You know him?

848
01:08:35,158 --> 01:08:36,989
His name is Roberto.

849
01:08:38,428 --> 01:08:40,259
He liked to help kids.

850
01:08:53,676 --> 01:08:55,507
You hear about Roberto?

851
01:08:59,248 --> 01:09:02,183
Yeah. l saw him.

852
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:08,084
They put the dogs
on that poor, sweet old man.

853
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,255
Put the dogs on him.

854
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:17,588
Chewed him up like a piece of meat.

855
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:26,706
l just don't...

856
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:31,607
l don't understand this place anymore.

857
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,278
l don't.

858
01:09:36,919 --> 01:09:38,318
l'm just saddened.

859
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:44,717
lt'll get better.

860
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:02,505
Mr. Bone, someone's here to see you.

861
01:10:06,682 --> 01:10:08,513
Come on, baby, let's go.

862
01:10:12,555 --> 01:10:13,852
Cute kid.

863
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:16,948
Always wanted one of my own.

864
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:21,627
l gotta call you pimp of the year, player.

865
01:10:22,164 --> 01:10:24,564
l give you my best girl two days ago.

866
01:10:24,634 --> 01:10:28,570
l turn around,
find you putting it to the nanny.

867
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:31,736
What are you doing here?

868
01:10:33,342 --> 01:10:34,969
lt's on, brother.

869
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:37,877
lt is on.

870
01:10:39,715 --> 01:10:41,205
What is on?

871
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:45,446
The fight between you and Price.

872
01:10:48,224 --> 01:10:50,692
You put the money up for the fight?

873
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,489
Five million dollars.

874
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:55,961
But l never said l would fight.

875
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:57,894
Excuse me?

876
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:00,628
l told you l'd think about it.

877
01:11:01,337 --> 01:11:02,998
l thought about it.

878
01:11:03,406 --> 01:11:05,101
Decided not to fight.

879
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:10,601
Man, are you out of your fucking mind?

880
01:11:11,314 --> 01:11:14,579
Five million dollars.

881
01:11:16,352 --> 01:11:19,219
-Get it back.
-Get it back. Get it back.

882
01:11:19,722 --> 01:11:21,155
Do you know

883
01:11:22,258 --> 01:11:25,557
how much shit you are getting me in?

884
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:31,489
You're smarter than that.

885
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:36,001
You are in that fight.

886
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,837
Yes, motherfucker.

887
01:11:40,743 --> 01:11:42,438
You are in that fight

888
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:45,446
or somebody's gonna be dead.

889
01:11:50,953 --> 01:11:51,942
You're right.

890
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:53,981
Somebody might be.

891
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:56,516
No.

892
01:11:56,859 --> 01:11:59,259
Ease the fuck back there, motherfucker.

893
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:48,576
Look. Listen.

894
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:52,781
l want you to take this money,
take the kids and check into a hotel.

895
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:56,682
Stay there till you hear from me.
lt's too dangerous for you now.

896
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:58,814
l will.

897
01:13:00,156 --> 01:13:02,852
But when l come back, l want you gone.

898
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,961
Rustle up the crew now.

899
01:13:13,836 --> 01:13:15,463
l want every motherfucker with a gun

900
01:13:15,538 --> 01:13:18,939
locked, loaded and ready to regulate
in fifteen minutes.

901
01:13:19,008 --> 01:13:22,205
Get Bone, get Pinball, that bitch,

902
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:26,413
the nanny, all of them motherfuckers!

903
01:13:42,465 --> 01:13:46,060
You smell like watermelon bubblegum.

904
01:13:48,838 --> 01:13:51,102
Where that motherfucker, Bone?

905
01:13:55,745 --> 01:13:57,679
Well, the last time l saw him,

906
01:13:57,747 --> 01:14:01,877
l believe he was at your mother's house with
a box of condoms and a bucket of chicken.

907
01:14:03,419 --> 01:14:04,818
He got jokes.

908
01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:13,256
You done did it now.
Don't you know l'm from Pittsburgh?

909
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:14,956
We don't play that shit!

910
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:16,122
No!

911
01:14:18,367 --> 01:14:20,665
l said, where that nigga, Bone?

912
01:14:22,037 --> 01:14:23,698
Where that nigga...

913
01:14:25,574 --> 01:14:27,166
-...Bone?
-Hold on, slick.

914
01:14:27,243 --> 01:14:30,838
Where that nigga, Bone?
Where that nigga, Bone?

915
01:14:32,748 --> 01:14:35,216
Where that nigga, Bone?

916
01:14:35,284 --> 01:14:37,582
l said, where that nigga, Bone?

917
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:40,379
Where that nigga, Bone?

918
01:14:55,104 --> 01:14:58,130
Man, B, you're really good with that gun
as you are with your fists.

919
01:14:58,207 --> 01:14:59,834
You gonna tell me
what the hell's going on around here?

920
01:14:59,909 --> 01:15:02,469
You wanna talk about it here
or down at the police station?

921
01:15:02,545 --> 01:15:03,944
Yeah, let's talk about that later.

922
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:06,914
But help me get this side of beef off of me.

923
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:11,211
James.

924
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:13,687
Homegirl says she got the 41 1 on Angela.

925
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:16,717
Yeah, l seen that girl y'all was
talking about at the lntersection.

926
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:19,317
-What intersection?
-No, man the lntersection,

927
01:15:19,395 --> 01:15:23,354
back where the judge sent me to get clean.
She in there.

928
01:15:23,432 --> 01:15:25,195
That girl, she in there.

929
01:15:36,145 --> 01:15:37,442
Seven.

930
01:15:52,895 --> 01:15:54,089
Angela.

931
01:15:56,932 --> 01:15:58,422
Angela, come on, get up.

932
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,024
What's up, bitches?

933
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:01,433
The fuck you gonna do?

934
01:16:02,037 --> 01:16:05,632
Don't move. 'Cause l'd love
to bust a cap in one of your asses.

935
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:20,185
Get their cell phones.

936
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:35,135
-You got that bitch yet?
<i>-Yeah, I've got her</i>

937
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,004
-Bone?
<i>-Now I'm coming for you</i>

938
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:45,543
Fuck.

939
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:05,293
Okay, motherfucker.

940
01:17:07,636 --> 01:17:09,331
Okay, motherfucker.

941
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:14,373
-What's up?
-You wanna play games?

942
01:17:14,443 --> 01:17:17,412
Time to play
follow the motherfucking leader.

943
01:17:22,818 --> 01:17:24,945
Shit. He wants us to follow him.

944
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,455
And l think l know where.

945
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:33,184
Yeah, Franklin. James.

946
01:17:33,262 --> 01:17:36,322
That fight, it has to happen tonight.

947
01:18:34,056 --> 01:18:35,648
Good evening, sir.

948
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:37,453
This way, if you will.

949
01:18:50,706 --> 01:18:53,641
Mr. Bone, it's good of you to join us.

950
01:18:54,676 --> 01:18:58,237
Like l said, family, you are gonna fight.

951
01:18:59,214 --> 01:19:01,842
And you are gonna win me back my money.

952
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:05,386
And if l don't fight?

953
01:19:05,454 --> 01:19:07,217
Then you'll die.

954
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:12,057
And l'll go back to town
and l'll kill the nanny

955
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:16,063
and the three little brats
and your little rat, Pinball.

956
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:18,963
And this will hurt.

957
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:22,128
But l'll gut and filet Angela like a sea bass.

958
01:19:22,838 --> 01:19:24,635
Just like you killed Roberto.

959
01:19:24,706 --> 01:19:28,164
That stupid old man opened his mouth
one time too many.

960
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:32,373
And you killed my friend Danny in prison,
set him up for a murder he didn't commit.

961
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:34,006
You knew Danny?

962
01:19:35,117 --> 01:19:37,449
So that's what this is about.

963
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:39,845
Danny and Angela.

964
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:43,418
He was a stupid-ass boy.

965
01:19:44,259 --> 01:19:46,318
He didn't deserve Angela.

966
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:50,193
Well, l guess right about now
you'll be getting the picture

967
01:19:50,265 --> 01:19:52,358
about how the fuck we roll.

968
01:19:52,434 --> 01:19:55,460
James, you talk too much.

969
01:19:55,637 --> 01:19:57,901
Yes, you do.

970
01:20:01,977 --> 01:20:06,107
l wanna report a possible homicide,
4215 Westgate Terrace.

971
01:20:06,548 --> 01:20:09,312
Yeah, l'm about to send you a video.
All right.

972
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:18,186
So, you're ready to fight, Mr. Bone?

973
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:20,618
And if l don't?

974
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:23,995
Then l'll beat you where you stand.

975
01:20:24,066 --> 01:20:25,658
Need l say more?

976
01:20:26,135 --> 01:20:28,069
Do you want to change?

977
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:30,869
For what?

978
01:23:10,065 --> 01:23:11,362
Not bad.

979
01:23:58,947 --> 01:24:01,142
Winner by forfeit, Price.

980
01:24:05,387 --> 01:24:07,514
You motherfucker.

981
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:11,324
-James!
-Fuck you, too.

982
01:24:29,344 --> 01:24:30,538
O'Hara.

983
01:25:40,348 --> 01:25:42,543
-l'll see you later.
-Nobody move!

984
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:43,914
L.A.P.D.

985
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:46,545
L.A.P.D.! Everybody, stay where you are!

986
01:25:48,757 --> 01:25:52,693
lf l go down, you go down, too.

987
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:54,859
We'll see.

988
01:25:58,133 --> 01:25:58,533
<i>Hey, Bone, when I get out,</i>

989
01:25:58,533 --> 01:26:00,831
<i>Hey, Bone, when I get out,</i>

990
01:26:01,136 --> 01:26:03,366
you got family on the outside.

991
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,865
Believe that, big homie.

992
01:26:08,343 --> 01:26:09,674
Believe that.

993
01:26:31,633 --> 01:26:33,601
Wanna go see your mommy?

994
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:38,036
Go, baby.

995
01:26:53,788 --> 01:26:55,915
Never gonna leave you again.

996
01:26:59,127 --> 01:27:00,458
Never again.

997
01:27:12,574 --> 01:27:16,874
l know l said you had to leave,
but you can stay if you like.

998
01:27:19,614 --> 01:27:24,517
No, you were... You were right. l'm trouble.

999
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:30,050
You knew that boy was here the whole time,
didn't you?

1000
01:27:31,826 --> 01:27:33,794
And who his mother was

1001
01:27:34,429 --> 01:27:37,728
long before you ever came
and knocked on my door.

1002
01:27:40,869 --> 01:27:44,566
l've got some money in this envelope
for you.

1003
01:27:45,607 --> 01:27:47,336
Nobody's looking for it.

1004
01:27:49,377 --> 01:27:54,144
l'd like Angela to stay here with Jared
after she gets cleaned up.

1005
01:27:54,215 --> 01:27:56,911
-That's if it's all right with you.
-lt's all right.

1006
01:28:01,022 --> 01:28:04,685
You did all of this
just to keep a jailhouse promise?

1007
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:08,320
l like to keep my promises.

1008
01:28:13,435 --> 01:28:14,868
l gotta go.

1009
01:28:39,761 --> 01:28:41,160
Thank you.

1010
01:28:47,702 --> 01:28:49,363
Give you a lift?

1011
01:28:51,272 --> 01:28:52,569
No.

1012
01:28:53,241 --> 01:28:54,902
l think l'll walk.

1013
01:28:56,945 --> 01:28:59,778
Life in the city keep going, don't it?

1014
01:28:59,848 --> 01:29:01,179
Oh, yeah.

1015
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:02,438
Sure you don't wanna stick around?

1016
01:29:02,517 --> 01:29:06,248
l could set some fights up.
We could make some real money, man.

1017
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:09,950
Nope. Got some business to take care of.

1018
01:30:21,329 --> 01:30:22,887
Sit on my shank,
motherfucker.
