You've been on holiday, I understand.
Relaxing, I hope.

Hardly relaxing, but most satisfying.

It's an unusually fine Solera.

- Unmistakable.
- Precisely.

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,350
Tell me, Commander,
how far does your expertise

82
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,874
extend into the field of diamonds?

83
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,755
Hardest substance found in nature.
They cut glass. Suggest marriage.

84
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,957
They've replaced a dog
as a girl's best friend. That's it.

85
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,350
Refreshing to hear there's one subject
you're not an expert on.

86
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,594
Yes, well, perhaps I'd better give you
a brief background into our problem.

87
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,798
80 per cent of the world's diamonds
come from mines in South Africa.

88
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,917
<i>Most are dug out of shafts</i>
<i>of diamond-bearing clay</i>

89
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,833
<i>at depths of up to 3000 feet.</i>

90
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,879
<i>The whole process operates</i>
<i>under an airtight security system.</i>

91
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,791
<i>It's an essential precaution,</i>

92
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,228
<i>even though the industry prides itself on</i>
<i>the loyalty and devotion of its workers.</i>

93
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,836
<i>Naturally the security measures</i>
<i>tend to ensure that loyalty,</i>

94
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,469
<i>as do the extensive amenities</i>
<i>and social services we provide.</i>

95
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,553
<i>There's a permanent staff</i>
<i>of doctors and nurses, even dentists.</i>

96
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,475
<i>The whole process operates</i>
<i>under an airtight security system.</i>

97
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,232
<i>It's a necessary precaution,</i>

103

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,832

- Of course.

110
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,393
I'm not going to hurt you. Just open.
No, no, no, open wide.

111
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,950
Argh!

112
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,516
Curious how everyone who touches
those diamonds seems to die.

113
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,036
- <i>(man)</i> Stop right there. Who are you?
- Dr Tynan sent us.

114
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,634
- Why didn't he come himself?
- He was taken sick.

115
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,918
Bitten by the bug. He sent this for you.

116
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,916
If God had wanted man to fly...

117
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,675
He would have given him wings, Mr Kidd.

118
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,794
No security system is perfect. We've
always accepted a degree of smuggling.

119
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,829
But over the past two years, despite all
our precautions, it's gone up alarmingly.

120
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,391
- None of the stones reach the market.
- Sir Donald thinks someone's stockpiling.

121
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,634
What concerns us is someone dumping
the stones on the market, or...

122
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,553
Making you agree to perpetual blackmail.

123
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,631
Exactly.

124
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,919
What we need to know
is who the stockpilers are.

125
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,470
The letter U is for "umbrella".

126
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,275
We take it lest it rain.

127
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,399
We hope we shan't want it
till we're home again.

128
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,268
- Two men to see you, missy.
- <i>(teacher)</i> "Gentlemen", Joshua.

129

Where to this time?

131
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,070
- Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam, how lovely.

132
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,197
I'll have to bring back
some pictures for the children.

133
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,352
Ask, and ye shall receive, Mrs Whistler.

134
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,715
Thus endeth the lesson for today,
gentlemen.

135
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,634
Several recent murders in South Africa
have complicated matters.

136
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,757
If they shut down operations
before we discover them...

137
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,197
It would be catastrophic for us
and for the government.

138
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,193
- I've always fancied a trip to South Africa.
- You're going to Holland.

139
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,838
For some time now, we've had our eyes
on a professional smuggler, Peter Franks.

140
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,117
- He's due to leave for Amsterdam.
- Do we know his contacts?

141
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,749
We do function in your absence,
Commander.

142
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,795
Passport, sir?

143
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,910
Mr Franks, there's a message
for you at Passport Control.

144
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,037
That door over there.
You can park your car outside.

145
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,111
Thank you.

146
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,917
Mr Franks, your passport is quite in order.

147
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,311
Anyone seeing you in that outfit would
be discouraged from leaving the country.

148
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,595
What can I bring you back from Holland?

149
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,433
A diamond? In a ring?

150
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,869
Would you settle for a tulip?

151
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,835
Yes.

<i>Unfortunately they ran out of money. So</i>
<i>that is why it is called the Skinny Bridge.</i>

155
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,549
<i>On your right, those beautiful old houses</i>
<i>can be seen in Rembrandt's paintings.</i>

156
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:59,398
<i>And now, if you will look to your left</i>
<i>as we go down the Amstel, you can see...</i>

157
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,277
<i>Oh.</i>

158
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,749
Mrs Whistler did want some pictures
of the canals for the children.

159
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,960
How kind of you, Mr Kidd.
The children will be so thrilled.

160
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,237
- <i>(woman) Yes?</i>
- Franks. Peter Franks.

161
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,072
<i>Come up. Third floor.</i>

162
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,792
Make yourself at home.
I'll be out in a minute.

163
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,591
Help yourself to a drink.

164
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,671
Is Mr Case not at home?

165
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,356
There is no Mr Case. The T is for Tiffany.

166
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,797
Tiffany Case? Definitely distinctive.

167
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,908
I was born there, on the first floor, while
my mother looked for a wedding ring.

168
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,390
I'm glad for your sake
it wasn't Van Cleef and Arpels.

169
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,959
Weren't you a blonde when I came in?

170
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,678
Could be.

171
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,197
I tend to notice little things like that.
Whether a girl is a blonde or a brunette.

172
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,192
And which do you prefer?

173
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,590
Providing the collars and cuffs match...

174
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,150
We'll talk about that later.
Let me have your glass.

175
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,312
I'll get you some ice.

176
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,679
That's quite a nice little nothing
you're almost wearing. I approve.

177
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,754
I don't dress for the hired help.
Let's see your passport, Franks.

178
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,712
Occupation: Transport consultant?
That's a little cute, isn't it?

179
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,398
- I'll finish dressing.
- Don't. Not on my account.

180
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,917
I don't care much for redheads.
Terrible tempers.

181
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,959
- But somehow it seems to suit you.
- It's my own.

182
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,191
But it needs some soft lighting.
I know this restaurant...

183
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,670
- I never mix business with pleasure.
- Neither do I.

184
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,718
Good. We can start
by saving the cute remarks

185
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,951
until after you get
the diamonds into Los Angeles.

186
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,795
- Where are they now?
- Your problem is getting them in.

187
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,316
- How much is there?
- 50,000 carats.

188
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,837
At 142 carats an ounce, that's an awful lot
of ice. That won't be easy.

189
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,798
That's why you're being paid 50 grand.

190
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,838
What did you think it was going to be?
A pair of earrings?

191
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,072
And, Franks, for God's sakes,
come up with something original.

192
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,591
I've got to hand it to you, Q.
Quite ingenious.

193
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,911
An obvious little notion.
Thought it might come in handy.

194
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,912
By the way, M's been trying
to get in touch with you.

195
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,150
That Peter Franks has escaped.

196
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,990
<i>He killed one of the guards</i>
<i>on the way up to London.</i>

197
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,069
Hello?

198
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,592
Hello? Are you there?

199
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,908
Oh!

200
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,272
- <i>(Tiffany) Yes?</i>
- Peter Franks.

201
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,635
<i>Third floor.</i>

202
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,188
- <i>Guten abend.</i>
- Good evening.

203
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,390
<i>Bitte.</i>

204
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,678
- <i>(German accent)</i> You are English?
- Yes, I'm English.

205
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,955
I speak English.

206
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,594
- Who is your floor?
- Three, please.

207
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,237
- Is he dead?
- I sincerely hope so.

208
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,031
- Who is he?
- No idea.

209
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,351
This chap's been following me
all day today.

210
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,789
My God!

211
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,269
You've just killed James Bond.

212
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,949
Is that who it was?
It just proves no one's indestructible.

213
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,635
You don't kill James Bond and
sit waiting for the cops to arrive.

214
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,109
We've got to get
the diamonds out of here fast.

215
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,475
Where are they?

216
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,596
A little old lady dropped them by
yesterday morning.

217
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,271
Priceless.

218
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,910
I think we ought to let Mr Bond
carry the load from here on out.

219
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,629
It's funny. All the things one wanted to
say to one's brother when it's all too late.

220
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,393
Let me assure you
of our deepest condolences.

221
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,472
Would you please board the aircraft?

222
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,990
- We were inseparable, you know.
- Please, Mr Franks.

223
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:11,312
<i>(air stewardess) Lufthansa announce the</i>
<i>departure of flight, LH450 to Los Angeles.</i>

224
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,916
<i>Will you please fasten your seatbelts?</i>
<i>No smoking until airborne. Thank you.</i>

225
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,151
They're both aboard. I must say,
Miss Case seems quite attractive.

226
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,435
For a lady.

Follow me to Customs, please.

231
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,870
Peter Franks, Jerry.

232
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,517
Get some lunch, Jerry. I'll take over.

233
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,708
Death certificate, please, Mr Franks.

234
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,588
Well, well, well. Felix Leiter, you old fraud.

235
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,993
On behalf of the CIA, welcome to America.

236
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,470
Someone sent their brain trust
down to meet you.

237
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,878
I give up. I know the diamonds
are in the body, but where?

238
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,758
Alimentary, Dr Leiter.

239
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,510
So long, James. Keep in touch.

240
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,718
The rest of your luggage has been
cleared, Mr Franks. OK, fellas.

241
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,598
You wanna sit in the front, Mr Franks?

242
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,036
It's a lot smoother ride
in the front, Mr Franks.

243
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,918
Yes, I believe I'll sit in front.

244
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,471
The stiff... <i>(clears throat)</i> deceased
back there. Your brother, Mr Franks?

245
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,551
Yes, it was.

246
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,631
I got a brudder.

247
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,757
Small world.

248
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,231
<i>(soothing organ music)</i>

249
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,231
Mr Franks, I'm Morton Slumber.

250
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,632
Please accept my heartfelt
condolences at this most difficult hour.

251
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,110
Well, he is heading
for a better world, Mr Slumber.

252
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,555
There is some consolation in that.

253
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,838
Now then, if we're ready
to begin the final journey...

254
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,238
- May his soul rest in peace.
- Oh, yes. Amen.

255
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,472
If you would care to follow me into
my office, we will bring you the urn.

256
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,314
I'm happy you chose our half-couch,
hinged-panel, slumber-on casket.

257
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,198
I'm sure your brother
would have appreciated it.

258
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,714
I'm sure he did.

259
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,791
Please, be seated.

260
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,314
Ashes to ashes...

261
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,391
- Dust to dust.
- Exactly.

262
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,598
At a moment like this, I'm sure you'd
rather be left alone for reflection.

263
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,874
Most thoughtful.

264
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,316
We've selected a private niche
in our Garden of Remembrance.

265
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,110
It's the one with the restful chartreuse
curtains and the Angel's Breath gold trim.

266
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,274
- I hope you'll find everything in order.
- It has all been impeccable, Mr Slumber.

267
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,351
So far.

268
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,678
Very moving.

269
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,355
- Heart-warming, Mr Wint.
- A glowing tribute, Mr Kidd.

270
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,272
You dirty, double-crossin' limey fink.
Those goddamn diamonds are phonies.

271
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,189
Now, don't tell me. You're St Peter?

272
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,714
Paste, glass. Where's the real stuff?

273
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,998
Where's the real money? You wouldn't
burn up 50,000 real dollars, would you?

274
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,834
One last break, Franks.
Where are the real diamonds?

275
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,912
Get me the real money,
I'll bring you the real diamonds.

276
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,797
Where are you goin'?

277
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,952
I hear that the Hotel Tropicana
is quite comfortable.

278
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,554
My condolences, gentlemen.

279
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,518
Hello, Felix. Very comfortable.

280
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,990
There's one problem.
I want the real merchandise - quickly.

281
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,356
<i>Q has just arrived with it.</i>
<i>We'll be up with them in the morning.</i>

282
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,069
<i>So I'd sit tight, if I were you.</i>
<i>No sense in looking for trouble.</i>

283
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,789
<i>Just enjoy yourself, James.</i>
<i>I'm sure you know how.</i>

284
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,589
Quite. I'll probably
take in a show, or something.

285
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,151
<i>(distant laughter)</i>

286
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,149
<i>(man)</i> How do you like me so far?

287
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,708
People say I have
the body of Rock Hudson.

288
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,475
If he ever finds out what I'm doin' to it,
he'll be madder than hell.

289
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,518
I call these girls my Acorns.

290
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,956
They're a gift from Willard Whyte,
who is upstairs right now,

291
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,237
playing Monopoly with real buildings.

292
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,713
Tryin' to find Willard Whyte is like
tryin' to find a virgin in a maternity ward.

293
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,509
And on behalf of the Whyte House,
I wanna let you folks know,

294
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,469
you've been a lousy audience.
So get lost. See ya later.

295
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,755
<i>(Mr Wint)</i> Shady Tree.

296
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,798
Shady, we just adored your act.

297
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,792
- What taste, style.
- We have a few suggestions.

298
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,873
Critics and material I don't need.
I haven't changed my act in 40 years.

299
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,360
Hold it. Don't go in there.

300
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,714
We didn't get the real diamonds,
so we need Tree alive.

301
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,758
That's most annoying.

The loser...

304
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,752
That's it, pussycat. I shot the whole wad.

305
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,831
What do you say? Back to my place?

306
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,469
You're a nice person, Maxie.
Really, you are.

307
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,439
Why don't you go take a nap,
and I'll see you next year?

308
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,877
<i>(Bond)</i> May I have 5000 dollars?
No, make it 10,000. 2000 dollar limit.

309
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,112
- Is there some problem?
- Mr Saxby?

310
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,796
This gentleman wants 10,000 dollar credit
with a 2000 dollar limit.

311
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,316
My name is Franks. Peter Franks.

312
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,716
Mr Franks' credit's good.
Good luck to you, Mr Franks.

313
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,792
Thank you. I'll have two stacks now.

314
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,713
Give the gentleman 4000.

315
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,438
<i>(Bond)</i> Thank you.

316
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,318
- Hi. I'm Plenty.
- But of course you are.

317
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,757
- Plenty O'Toole.
- Named after your father, perhaps?

318
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,991
Would you like some help?
On the craps, I mean.

319
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,071
That's very kind of you.

320

<i>(croupier)</i> Coming up. Coming up.

321

Next shooter is a lady. Ladies are lucky.

322
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,950
Nine. Mark nine.

323
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,354
Seven, loser. The lucky lady craps out.

324
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,872
Your shot, Mr F.

325
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,470
- <i>(Southern accent) Willard Whyte.</i>
- Tree is dead. Turn on number two.

326
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,311
<i>(Saxby) It's Peter Franks.</i>

327
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,279
Twice ten. Hard ten. Ten's the number.

328
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,114
I'll take the full odds on the ten.
200 on the hard way.

329
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,193
The limit on all the numbers,
250 on the eleven. Thank you very much.

330
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,238
Say, you've played this game before.

331
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,311
Just once.

332
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,398
- <i>Now what do we do?</i>
- Don't bother me with details.

333
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,675
Just get me the diamonds.

334
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,193
You handle those cubes
like a monkey handles coconuts.

335
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,034
Thank you, gentlemen,
for such a sterling service.

336
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,190
Well, that's 50,000 dollars.

337
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,353
Minus 5000 for you. Leaves me 45,000,
and thank you very much.

338
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,874
Well, it was nothing, really.

339
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,919
You know something, Peter Franks?
You're a terrific guy.

340
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,514
A little weird, but a terrific guy.

341
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,194
Say, why don't we go someplace
and have a drink?

342
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,190
A drink?

343
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,235
If you'd like to come in, Plenty.

344
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,154
How pretty. What a super place you have.

345
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,311
<i>(Plenty)</i> Just give me one second, lover.

346
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,471
Good evening.

347
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,674
You've caught me
with more than my hands up.

348
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,753
What the hell is this?
A perverts' convention, or something?

349
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,958
Listen, you can't do this to me.
Stop that. I've got friends in this town.

350
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,239
Exceptionally fine shot.

351
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,312
I didn't know there was a pool down there.

352
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,072
All right. Let's get down to business.
I presume you've come for the real...

353
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,437
The real diamonds.

354
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,149
Good evening, Miss Case.

355
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,959
Sorry about your fulsome friend.
I'll bet you really missed something.

356
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,715
The evening may not be
a total loss after all.

357
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,075
Why don't we talk a bit first?

358
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,912
First?

359
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,072
Well, what would you like to talk about?

360
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,230
You pick a subject.

361
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,471
- Diamonds?
- Good boy.

362
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,758
And you want to know where they are,
and whether I'm working alone or not.

363
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,434
So far, so good. Keep going.

364
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,910
And if not, then with whom.

365
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,552
So you can inform your superiors
and acquire the diamonds.

366
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,996
Peter, I'm very impressed.

367
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,311
There's a lot more to you
than I had expected.

368
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,159
Presumably I'm the condemned man,
and obviously you're the hearty breakfast.

369
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,037
Right?

370
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,273
You're not going to tell me
where the diamonds are, are you?

371
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,273
- What diamonds?
- Sooner or later you'll have to talk.

372
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,351
They'll make you.

373
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,070
At the very least,
you'll never get out of town alive.

374
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,516
I can solve that little problem.

375
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,715
It's lucky for me that I ran into you.

376
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,910
A fifty-fifty split.

377
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,912
You get the diamonds, I get us out.

378
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,035
Us?

379
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,192
Well, I can't very well help you
and then stick around.

380
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,795
We could be on a plane and
out of the country by tomorrow night.

381
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,077
Rio, Hong Kong...

382
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,516
- I know a good tailor in Hong Kong.
- Hong Kong.

383
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,396
All right. I'll get the diamonds,
you get the plane tickets.

384
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,395
No. The airport's too obvious. A rented car
should do us fine for openers.

385
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,391
Good thinking.

386
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,268
And since you're the one who's
being watched, I'll get the diamonds,

387
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,555
you get the car.

388
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,518
- That's very good thinking.
- Oh, Peter.

389
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50,594
I have a feeling this is the beginning
of a wonderful relationship.

390
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,395
- Darling...
- Hm?

391
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,517
Where do I pick up the diamonds?

392
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,469
Well, when was the last time
you visited a circus?

393
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,995
Circus Circus proudly presents
the Flying Palacios.

394
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,635
- She's in the building.
- Right. Stand by.

395
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,269
James, next time pick a contact
point when you're standing up.

396
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,874
- If she gives your men the slip...
- Relax.

397
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,511
I've got upwards of 30 agents down there.
A mouse with sneakers on couldn't get by.

398
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,710
Give Maxwell his cue.

399
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,032
This is Quarterback.
Operation Passover, commence.

400
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,510
Quarterback to Tight End.
Operation Passover, commence.

401
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,237
Roger.

402
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,148
She's on her way. So far, so good.

403
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,232
- Good luck. I'll see you later.
- Where are you going?

404
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,677
The car rental agency.
Our little rendezvous?

405
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,514
You don't think she'll show up, do you?
That's a thousand-to-one shot.

406
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,436
More like even money: Her devotion to
larceny versus my incomparable charm.

407
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,073
<i>(man)</i> All right now, kiddy.
You ready? Aim, fire! Go ahead.

408
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,956
What did I tell you? Didn't I promise you
a winner every time? There you are.

409
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,909
All right, boys and girls, here we go again.
All you have to do is just take your gun...

410
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,516
All right, now here we have a little lady.
Here we have a little man.

411
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,718
And here we have a big lady. You're
a little out of your league, aren't you?

412
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,314
Come on, point the gun.
You know what to do.

413
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,632
All ready? Get set. Now hold it till I say go.

414
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,392
Go!

415
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,472
Come on. That's it.
Everybody point right at the clown.

416
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,676
Winner every time. Get 'em up there.

417
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,397
There we are. All right.
That's the way to do it.

418
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,948
Look at that. And we have another winner.

419
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,953
Annie Oakley on the end, huh?

420
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,838
Here we are. What an eye, what an eye.

421
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,514
Wait a second. Hold it.
I saw the whole thing.

422
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,068
The machine's fixed.
Who's she? Your mother?

423
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,958
Blow up your pants.

424
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,955
<i>(boy)</i> One win! She only had one win.

You're supposed to have 24
to win that dog.

426
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,310
Will you give it a rest, kid, huh? Boys and
girls, here we go. Everybody come on.

<i>She was captured</i>

<i>and will change very slowly</i>
<i>into a ferocious 450-pound gorilla.</i>

433
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,678
Please be very still, ladies and gentlemen.
We must have absolute silence,

434
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,470
so we wouldn't disturb Zambora
from her transcendental state.

435
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,510
We must warn you that in every scientific
experiment there's always a danger.

436
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,114
So keep in mind those curtains is an exit.

437
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,228
God forbid something should go wrong
over here, get outta here.

Now we start the transformation.

waiting for nonexistent diamonds.

And what the hell is my black wig
doing in the pool?

454

- She's...
- Dead.

Poor Plenty must have
stumbled in here looking for you.

458

I don't believe you.

They've missed me once, and you're next.

- You sound like a cop...

462
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,388
- Who's your connection?
- All I know is voices on a phone.

463

They got me this place
and told me to wait for instructions.

You'd find it hard to hear underwater.
Where's the stuff?

- Hi.

490
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,077
- I haven't seen you here before.
- Klaus Hergersheimer.

491
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,118
- New here?
- I've been here three years. G Section.

492
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,589
How are things in G Section?

493
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,752
Still the same old grind. Checking
radiation shields for replacement.

494
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,673
By the way, where's yours?

495
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,275
I've been waiting a couple of days
for you guys to deliver them.

496
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,955
Gee, I'm sorry.
You should have given us a phone call.

497
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,874
I've got one here.
Lucky for you, I carry spares.

498
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,191
You keep that on.
You can't be too careful about radiation.

499
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,751
- Absolutely. I feel much safer with this on.
- See you around.

500
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,350
Who are you? What do you want?

501
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,752
Klaus Hergersheimer. G Section.
Just checking on radiation shields.

502
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,628
- Now, let me see. You are...?
- Professor Dr Metz.

503
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,154
Our shields are fine. Now get out.

504
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:43,950
I'm sorry.
It won't take a moment, but I must verify.

505
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,476
Metz. How do you spell it?

506
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,677
Will you please leave, you irritating man?

507
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,070
Doctor, there's no reason
to run down the little people.

508
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,438
G Section may not be as important
as you are, but we do have our orders.

509
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,159
- Dr Metz, Willard Whyte for you.
- Right.

510
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,231
Out, out.

511
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,677
Hello, WW.

512
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,957
Yes, it's finally here.

513
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,429
Quite enough for completion.

514
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,512
We'll be through shortly.
No. No problems at all.

515
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,633
- Now will you get out of here?
- Certainly, Doctor.

516
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,757
I've seen everything I need to see.

517
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,115
Thank you very much.

You can drop me off at the next corner.
This whole thing is getting out of hand.

532

No regrets, but when you steal moon
machines from Willard Whyte, goodbye.

- Uh-huh.
- Well, what did he say?

557
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,510
Something about 20 years to life.
Nothing important.

558

Mr and Mrs Jones?

Yes. That's the name on the register,
Mr Leiter. What's the score with WW?

I'm cooperating, Mr Leiter. Really I am.

565
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,870
I can vouch for that.

566
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,430
This is not the real White House
and he's not the president.

567
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,751
- Why don't we just see him?
- The president I can get you in to see.

568

But until Washington believes
Whyte's a thief, that's the way it is.

569

In the mean time, I'm sure
you and Mrs Jones can amuse yourselves.

And just to make sure you're not
disturbed, I have a man upstairs.

And a miniature, transistorised version
is installed in his neck.

603
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,110
Or is it his neck? I never can remember.

604
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,953
Anyway, no matter. We both sound alike.

605
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,594
My congratulations to you both.

606
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,032
Nice little company.

607
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:45,113
Explosives, oil, electronics,
houses, aviation.

608
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,237
I've done well with it.
Tried to cut some of the fat off.

609
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:52,393
Actually, Mr Whyte's
a splendid administrator. <i>(laughs)</i>

610
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,233
- Damn thing runs itself.
- I suppose you killed him.

611
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,836
Nothing so melodramatic. I'm simply
holding him in cold storage, so to speak.

612
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,879
An insurance policy against
any outside interference with my plans.

613
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,033
Hm. The ideal kidnap victim.
No one's seen the man for five years.

614
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:12,398
- So who'd miss someone who's missing?
- How clever you are, Mr Bond.

615
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,917
Nice to see you haven't lost
that fine mental edge, 007.

616
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,949
Please don't get any foolish notions.
That missile is not a practical weapon.

617
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,912
It's hardly worth the effort.

618
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,037
After all, I wouldn't know
which one of you to kill.

619
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,680
We appreciate
your predicament, Mr Bond.

620
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,671
We deeply sympathise.

621
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,316
<i>(gun is cocked)</i>

622
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,593
Right idea, Mr Bond.

623
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,830
But wrong pussy.

624
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,038
I do so enjoy our little visits, Mr Bond.

625
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:07,274
However potentially painful they may be.
I'm afraid this one has come to an end.

626
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,557
What do you intend to do
with those diamonds?

627
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,756
An excellent question.

628
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,628
And one which will be hanging
on the lips of the world quite soon.

629
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,508
If I were to break the news to anyone,
it would be to you first, Mr Bond.

630
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:25,469
But it's late, I'm tired,
and there's so much left to do.

631
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,031
Good night, Mr Bond.

632
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,033
Well, go on, go on. It's merely a lift.

633
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,677
Or perhaps I should say "elevator".

634
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:50,471
You'll find it much more convenient than
mountaineering outside the Whyte House.

635
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:55,792
You press L, Mr Bond.
The word "lobby" begins with L.

636
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,717
<i>(hissing)</i>

637
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,391
<i>(Bond collapses)</i>

638
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,589
If at first you don't succeed, Mr Kidd...

639
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,274
Try, try again, Mr Wint.

640
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,115
<i>(bottle breaks)</i>

641

<i>(squeaking)</i>

643
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,957
One of us smells like a tart's handkerchief.

644
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,677
I'm afraid it's me.
Sorry about that, old boy.

01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,035
<i>(rat hisses)</i>

646

<i>(man)</i> I don't mind the machine
breaking down twice a day,

647
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:32,074
but why the hell does it always have to be
500 yards away from the nearest hatch?

648
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:37,948
All right, Charlie,
it's your turn to play hunchback.

649
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,593
Thank you very much.

650
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,753
I was walking my rat
and I seem to have lost my way.

651

<i>(phone rings)</i>

652

653
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,038
<i>(like Bert)</i> We got a problem.

654

<i>(as Blofeld) What's the matter with your</i>
<i>voice, Bert? Have you got a cold?</i>

655
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,673
<i>(more like Bert)</i> Never mind about that.
I just saw James Bond in the casino.

656
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,638
- That's impossible.
- <i>Yeah? Have a look for yourself.</i>

657
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:17,714
Hey, listen, if he's half the genius
they say he is, we're in for real trouble.

658
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:21,315
- <i>Now calm down, Bert.</i>
- It's a cinch he's not working alone.

659
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,951
This place must be crawling with agents.
I think we should move Willard Whyte.

660
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:29,476
<i>Nonsense. Mr Whyte is perfectly safe</i>
<i>at his own summerhouse.</i>

661
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,154
It's on the ridge,
about ten miles out of town.

662
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,710
<i>I'm a little surprised, Bert.</i>
<i>It's not like you to panic.</i>

663
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,190
I don't enjoy messing around
with a guy as tough as James Bond.

664
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,193
Never mind James Bond.
You get down to that house.

665
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,319
I'm afraid Mr Whyte has suddenly
outgrown his usefulness. Do it cleanly.

666
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:51,393
<i>(as Bert)</i> Don't worry.
Just leave everything to me.

667
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,359
<i>(as Bond)</i> That ridiculous contraption
actually seems to work, Q.

668
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,113
- You've surpassed yourself.
- Not a bit of it.

669
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,919
Made one of these
for the kids last Christmas.

670
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,199
James and I are heading for the house. Hit
the penthouse as soon as we find Whyte.

671
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,271
<i>(Blofeld)</i> Let me speak to Metz.

672
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:15,278
There's a change. Push all plans forward
by 24 hours. I'm joining you immediately.

673
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:25,673
Give me five minutes to get up there
and five minutes to find Whyte.

674
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,437
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

675
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,512
Ask me again in ten minutes' time.

676
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:37,272
Tell Maxwell to stand by
to hit the penthouse.

677
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,239
Well, hi there.

678
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,792
I'm Bambi.

679

Good morning, Bambi.

680
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:44,510
And I'm Thumper.
Is there something we can do for you?

681
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,672
I can think of several things offhand,

682
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,513
but at the moment
I'm looking for Willard Whyte.

683
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:54,195
Oh, Willie. Why, he's right out there.

684
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:00,313
And that's all there is to it?

685
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,595
Not quite.

686
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,468
First we're gonna have a ball.

687

You're on again, Bambi.

689
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,837
Thumper.

<i>(both)</i> Yah!

Wouldn't you know it?
Willard Whyte is about to be executed,

693
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,629
and guess who's giving
breaststroke lessons.

694
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:12,998

<i>(both gasp)</i>

696
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,279
Still haven't found out.

01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,431
Right.

698
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,993
FBI? CIA?

699
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,470
No. British Intelligence, Mr Whyte.
James Bond.

700
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,153
I see you've met my friends
Bambi and Thumper.

701
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,959
Yes, we did have a bit of a chat.

702
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,237
What the hell's happened to me
and what can I do about it?

703
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:13,233
Let's get out of here first
and I'll explain it to you en route.

01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,871
- Bert Saxby?
- Yeah.

709
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,191
Tell him he's fired.

710
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,115
Hi there, Mr Q. Are you having any luck?

711
01:26:55,200 --> 01:27:00,399
- I'm being somewhat successful, thanks.
- Listen, Mr Q, I was wondering.

712
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:04,712
Have you heard any talk
about me from Felix or James?

713
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,791
No, I'm afraid not.

714
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:12,034
I guess I'm working for the good guys
now, but I'm still two steps away from jail.

715
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:16,238
I thought you might be able
to put in a good word.

716
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,434
That's unbelievable.

717
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:33,837
An electromagnetic RPM controller.
Been aching to give it a try.

718
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,754
You see, pressure on the case here
when the desired symbols appear,

719
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:44,439
this causes the rotation of the cylinders to
stutter at the precise moment needed to...

720
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,109
Cab, lady?

721
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,511
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

722
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,795
I'm delighted to meet you, Miss Case.

723
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,668
I'd so dreaded the prospect of
making this tedious journey alone.

724
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:28,631
It was right here.
About six feet high, with a solar panel.

725
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,508
- It had these aerofoils that seemed to...
- Draw it for me.

726
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,114
Was Dr Metz on your payroll, Mr Whyte?

727
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,078
No, but I heard of him.
Everybody in our business has.

728
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,197
The world's leading expert
on laser refraction.

729
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,874
A committed idealist to peace.

730
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,590
And how in the hell Blofeld got
his hooks in him, I will never know.

731
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,194
How did he get security clearance
to work here?

732
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,636
From you, sir.
I talked to you personally about it.

733
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:57,029
I even recognised your voice just now.

734
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:02,831
I'm sure I told you not to keep the usual
duplicate microfilm records of the project.

735
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,070
Exactly.

736
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:08,596
Tom, what did <i>I tell you to do with this?

737
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,910
Send it to Vandenberg.

01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,117
Well, get 'em on the phone, now.

You won't believe this.

742
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,114
Wow.
This is a real honour, sir.

743
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,033
Shove it. Where's that satellite
I sent down there?

744
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,111
Blasted off 24 minutes ago, sir.

745
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:40,591
Perfect trajectory. All systems go.
We expect to enter orbit right on the nose.

746
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,555
- Wait. Something's happened.
- Just a moment, Mr Whyte.

747
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,835
The scanners have gone crazy.

748
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,639
- Premature separation.
- It doesn't make sense.

749
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,749
Stand by to abort.

750
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,274
- We can't control it, sir.
- Abort it.

751
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,072
- It's negative.
- We can't.

752
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:21,152
Something's taken over
the guidance systems.

753
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:26,189
- It's as if it had a will of its own.
- And there's not a damn thing we can do.

754
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,475
We're working on it. I'll call you back.

755
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,592
Well, whatever it is,
your friend Blofeld's controllin' it now.

756
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,839
A vast supply of diamonds manipulated
by an expert in light refraction.

757
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,309
The first beam was generated
through a diamond,

758
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:54,509
and if Metz deserves his reputation, the
power of that thing could be incredible.

759
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,591
And Blofeld's got it.

760
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:02,757
- Where is it now?
- <i>(man) Approaching North Dakota.</i>

761
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:06,594
- Alert Strategic Air Command.
- Give me an open line to SAC.

762
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,799
<i>(PA) Attention all personnel.</i>
<i>Attention all personnel.</i>

<i>Stand by for emergency procedure.</i>

764

<i>(phone rings)</i>

765
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,431
Willard Whyte.

766
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,271
Yes, General.

767
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:50,996
One of our missiles just accidentally
blew up in North Dakota.

768
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,833
Whatever's happenin',
Mr Bond, has started.

769
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,913
- Is this your herd?
- Mr Whyte, phone call from Washington.

770
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,992
- I'll catch it in the john.
- What about Blofeld?

771
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:24,072
- Not a trace, but we found a tunnel.
- Where's Tiffany?

772
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:28,950
Do you mind if we find Blofeld first?
Come on, let's hit that tunnel.

773
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,191
Argh!

774
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,999
Well, Washington just got word
from your friend with the cat.

775
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:02,868
Would you believe that this whole
country is bein' held for ransom

776
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,838
and we've got
till noon tomorrow to pay up?

777
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,913
So that's it, then.
Well, I'm sure you won't be alone.

778
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,996
An international auction, with nuclear
supremacy goin' to the highest bidder.

779
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:20,597
Tell me, what does he need
to control that satellite?

780
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:25,196
A simple set of tapes fed into a computer
bank. All he really needs is a building.

781
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:29,159
And these tapes? Large or small?

782
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:34,951
Conceivably any size,
from six inches to a cassette.

783
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:38,032
Assuming he's still using
your empire as a cover,

784
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:40,395
Blofeld could be anywhere on this map.

785
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,314
From Alaska to Florida,
from Maine to Oregon.

786
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,472
From Texas to Baja California.

787
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,511
Baja?

788
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:55,317
I haven't got anything at Baja.

789
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:05,636
<i>(radio) There is still no official explanation</i>
<i>of the simultaneous nuclear accidents</i>

Two more submarines
have taken up position.

797
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,560
Will those military aircraft
stand off forever?

798
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:37,349
What if they won't accept our ultimatum?
What if they decide to attack?

799
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:42,195
Calm yourself, Metz. This farcical show
of force was only to be expected.

800
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:46,990
The Great Powers flexing their muscles
like so many impotent beach boys.

801
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:51,551
I regret my threat to destroy a major city
unless they give in, but there it is,

802
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,838
the nuclear powers, like all bullies,
can only be intimidated by force.

803
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,071
- But how can...
- There's still an hour left to reply.

804
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:02,152
One hour for both of us
to achieve our common dream:

805
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:06,313
Total disarmament
and peace for the world.

806
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,237
- Sir, there's a single plane approaching.
- Range?

807
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,311
Two miles, and closing.

808
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,755
Stage One alert, please.

809
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,912

Good morning.
The Acme Pollution Inspection.

816
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:31,599
We're cleaning up the world and
thought this was a suitable starting point.

817
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,512
How disappointing. I was expecting
one head of state, at the very least.

818
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,636
Surely you haven't come to negotiate?

819
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:11,713
Your pitiful little island
hasn't even been threatened.

820
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:16,794
Search him from his toenails to the last
follicle on his head, then bring him to me.

821
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:33,468
<i>(~ "The British Grenadiers"</i>
<i>played by military band)</i>

822
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,992
I do so hate martial music.

823
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,631
But as usual, Mr Bond,
you were absolutely right.

824
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:52,157
You guessed correctly, that box contained
the master satellite control tape,

825
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:58,076
and you came aboard presumably
hoping to substitute this for the real thing.

826
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,513
So sorry to have ruined
the line of your suit for nothing.

827
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,555
Which line did you use on Miss Case?

828
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:12,076
Miss Case has taken
a reasonable attitude about all this.

829
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:16,950
Like any sensible animal, she's only
threatening when she's threatened.

830
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,999
It appears that you're holding all the aces,
down to the dragon lady here.

831
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:25,596
Jealousy? From you, Mr Bond?
I'm flattered.

832
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:31,357
As La Rochefoucauld observed,
"Humility is the worst form of conceit."

833
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,749
I do hold the winning hand.

834
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,391
Why don't you let me take you
on a little tour of our facilities?

835
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:42,359
Your chance to see
the real tape once again.

836
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:45,352
Can I tag along, Ernst?

837
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:49,274
I'd put something on
over that bikini first, my dear.

838
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:54,195
I've come too far to have the aim of my
crew affected by the sight of your body.

839
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:57,431
No word yet from anyone.

840
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,909
Only 12 minutes left.

841
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,357
Oh, well, I suppose
a little gentle prodding is called for.

842
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:08,672
As you see, Mr Bond,
the satellite is at present over...

843
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:10,959
Kansas.

844
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:16,114
But if we destroy Kansas,
the world may not hear about it for years.

845
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,953
Perhaps New York.
All that smut and traffic.

846
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,793
It would give them a chance
for a fresh start.

847
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:24,155
Washington, DC. Perfect.

848
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:27,516
Since we have not heard from them,
they will hear from us.

849
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:31,479
- See to it, Metz.
- Washington. Right.

850
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:36,076
And this, presumably,
is the control bank with the coded tape.

851
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:40,711
Right again, Mr Bond. All satellites
are controlled by a coded tape.

852
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,189
The trick is, of course, to have the code.

853
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,748
Obviously.
It all seems so perfectly simple.

854
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,879
I suppose one just presses that
and out it pops.

855
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:57,396
Put it back, Mr Bond. Immediately.

856
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,317
Hi, Ernst.

857
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:09,678
- Is Superman giving you any trouble?
- Put it back very carefully.

858
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,394
You've suddenly
become tiresome, Mr Bond.

859
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:20,153
Target fixed. Commence countdown.

860
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,708
Ten minutes and counting.

861
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:28,397
Take him away and throw him in the brig.
And search him again, just to make sure.

862
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:38,156
Bitch.

863
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:44,277
Your problems are all behind you now.

864
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,311
Stop him!

<i>(PA) Nine minutes and counting.</i>

866
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,834
I did it. I switched the tape in the machine.

867
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,913
- You twit. You put the real one back in.
- Come on, let's go.

868

870
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:03,951
There isn't a low-pressure area
within 200 miles of here. Let's go.

But I don't understand.
You said they wouldn't attack. You said...

878
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:39,919
The balloon was a signal. The fools must
think Mr Bond accomplished his mission.

879
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,468

Get them on the radio, Blofeld.
Tell them we give up.

886
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,390
Give up?
I've waited too long for this moment.

887

They'll pay dearly
for making a fool out of me.

Tiffany, my dear.

891
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:10,070
We're showing a bit more cheek
than usual, aren't we?

892
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,430
Take her below and
lock her up with Mr Bond.

What a pity. Such nice cheeks, too.

Destroy this, Metz.

01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,277
All systems interlock.

902
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,828
<i>Bathosub to crane: Commence lift.</i>

903
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,356
<i>Two minutes and counting.</i>

904
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,949
Power and breathing systems on.
Release catch is open.

905
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:20,555
Lower away.

906
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,672
<i>Bathosub to crane: Lower away.</i>

907
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,956
Wake up, man. Lower away.

908
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:37,228
You stupid idiot! You could've killed me.

909
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,151
<i>Disengage.</i>

910
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,157
<i>Disengage.</i>

911
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,039
<i>Disengage!</i>

912
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:50,793
Lower. Not up.

913
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:56,870
One minute and counting.

914
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:03,192
<i>Blofeld to Command Centre: Come in.</i>

915
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:07,313
<i>Blofeld to Command Centre: Come in.</i>

916
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,630
Damn you! Damn you.
Command Centre, come in.

917
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:25,072
<i>40 seconds and counting.</i>

918
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,315
Get the gun.

919
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,950
- Here.
- Shoot 'em.

920
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,153
Argh!

921
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,279
Jump!

922
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:58,075
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

923
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,629
So long, James.
I'll wire M you're on your way home.

924
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,359
Don't tell him which direction we've taken.

925
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:50,271
If you're havin' a good time,

926
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:54,831
let the captain know and I'll have him
steam around in circles.

927
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:13,388
James, there's something very important
I've been meaning to ask you. About us.

928
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,155
Oh?

929
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:21,236
I know in a relationship like ours, the girl's
not supposed to ask, but I can't help it.

930
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:25,950
And please think before answering.

931
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,873
- That I promise.
- James...

932
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,439
<i>(knock at door)</i>

933
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:45,710
There must be some mistake.
I didn't order anything.

934
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,552
No mistake, sir.

935
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:52,236
On the specific instructions and with
the compliments of Mr Willard Whyte.

936
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,471
Oysters Andaluz.

937
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,198
Shashlik.

938
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,831
Tidbits. Prime rib <i>en jus.</i>

939
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,831
Salade Utopia.

940
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,272
And for dessert, the <i>pièce de résistance,</i>

941
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:16,032
<i>la bombe surprise.</i>

942
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:17,917
Hm!

943
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,072
That looks fantastic. What's in it?

944
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:24,869
But then there would be no <i>surprise,</i>
would there, madame?

945
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,394
- If madam would care to be seated.
- Thank you.

946
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:31,473
This will just take a moment,
and then we will leave you in peace.

947
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:36,314
Wine, sir? Mouton Rothschild '55.

948
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,753
- May we begin?
- <i>(Bond)</i> Please do.

949
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:45,391
<i>(cork pops)</i>

950
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:56,113
- A happy selection, if I may say.
- I'll be the judge of that.

951
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:59,795
That's rather potent.
Not the cork - your aftershave.

952
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,599
Strong enough to bury anything.

953
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:09,239
But the wine is quite excellent.

954
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:13,313
Although, for such a grand meal,
I had rather expected a claret.

955
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:18,474
Of course. Unfortunately, our cellar
is rather poorly stocked with clarets.

956
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,595
Mouton Rothschild is a claret.

957
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:28,429
And I've smelt that aftershave before.
And both times I've smelt a rat.

958
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,309
Yee!

959
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,316
<i>(screams)</i>

960
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,318
Whooh.

961
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:16,799
Whooooh!

962
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:21,515
Whoa!

963
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:31,279
He certainly left
with his tails between his legs.

964
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:33,635
Oh, James.

965
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:37,156
Yes, what were you about to ask me?

966
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:39,071
James...

967
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:43,153
how the hell do we get
those diamonds down again?

968
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:50,915
<i>~ Diamonds are forever</i>

969
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:56,438
<i>~ Sparkling round my little finger</i>

970
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:00,957
<i>~ Unlike men, the diamonds linger</i>

971
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:08,515
<i>~ Men are mere mortals</i>
<i>who are not worth going to your grave for</i>

972
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:14,596
<i>~ I don't need love</i>

973
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:19,196
<i>~ For what good would love do me?</i>

974
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:23,432
<i>~ Diamonds never lie to me</i>

975
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:29,720
<i>~ For when love's gone</i>

976
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:33,509
<i>~ They'll lustre on</i>

977
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:40,111
<i>~ Diamonds are forever, forever, forever</i>

978
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:44,711
<i>~ Diamonds are forever, forever, forever</i>

979
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:49,271
<i>~ Forever</i>

980
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:52,909
<i>~ And ever</i>

981
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:58,952
