1
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,809
Boy...

2
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,053
Bring us the walking stick
of that blind bone-setter.

3
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,099
We'll pay you.

4
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,528
Watch out.Silence,he will hear you.

5
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,133
Thanks.

6
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,653
GO GO!

7
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,253
Go away,you son of a..!

8
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,772
Icci!

9
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,498
Even you...

10
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,770
...were fooled
by an innocent child!

11
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,336
Even the teacher...

12
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,532
...is weak
without his sword.

13
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,648
SEMETERY

14
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,538
Drink!

15
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,213
What are you doing?

16
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,139
You were working for Naruto.
Don't you recognise us?

17
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,136
Of the Naruto family?

18
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,813
I am the daughter!

19
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,490
What do you want again?
We've paid for this month!

20
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,890
You haven't paid for today.

21
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,459
Now you 're gonna pay
each time we come by.

22
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,091
-We wont be able to survive.
-Dont protest!

23
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,139
Shut up and pay.

24
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,129
Things were really bad with
the Funahatsi gang.

25
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,969
-Ginjo makes our life real hell!
-Damn you!

26
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,056
Unbelievable spectacle!

27
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,930
I guide a blind bone-setter
who curries my vegetable.

28
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,093
I wish i could see that!

29
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,209
You did a big favour for me.

30
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,330
Drink some tea.

31
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,290
-It's hot.
-Thanks.

32
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,412
Without your help...

33
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,099
...i couldn't bring them home.

34
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,691
Where are you sleaping tonight?

35
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,570
It will be the first time that you come.

36
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,896
You're welcome to stay.
I live alone.

37
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,409
Don't get any ideas.

38
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,289
I don't even thing about it.

39
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,973
-Is it too strong?
-No,it's just as it should be.

40
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,051
I can't thing that our
town is doomed.

41
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,019
Ginjo and Oggi are fine together.

42
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,854
They do us they want with us.

43
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,934
Really?You have such punks?

44
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,730
They teriffy the farmers.

45
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,170
and the town people.

46
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,617
They demand money for protection
every day.

47
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,618
If it keep going like this...

48
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,455
...the more we work,
the poorer we get.

49
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,419
You pay for protection each day?

50
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,889
We didnt use to.

51
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,213
We were paying each month.

52
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,130
Big difference.
Eacg month,each day.

53
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,098
Exactly.

54
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,572
Are you allright;

55
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,490
We'll stay here for a while.

56
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,660
I will work again as a bodyguard.

57
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,650
Don't you worry about me.

58
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,893
Don't do that job for me.

59
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,494
One day i'll become a clerk again.

60
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,978
Stop worrying.
You need some rest.

61
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,339
Eh,old man!

62
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,093
Where is Grandfather;

63
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,213
He's sick today.
HE won't come.

64
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,731
-You make him work toomuch.
-I'm sorry.

65
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,852
You must take care of him more.

66
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,294
Sake is awful,as always.

67
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,299
Can't get any better.

68
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,298
Same old story for 10 years!

69
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,055
Can you give it to that guy?

70
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,415
I'm not your clerk!

71
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,577
What a nerve!

72
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,975
Can't you take the by yourself?

73
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,169
Drink at the bench!

74
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,848
W-w-welcome.

75
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,736
Leave the "welcomes".

76
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,931
Where is this month's money?

77
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,138
Please,
giveme some time.

78
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,012
What a joke!

79
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,653
We never wait!

80
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,451
I'll find the money.

81
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,333
Say hello to your boss.

82
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,779
Your sake sucks!

83
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,499
Shut up!

84
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,257
What do you want?

85
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,896
Send a message to your boss.

86
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,172
Capable RONIN looks for bodyguard job.

87
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,658
Samurai...

88
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,177
It's late.

89
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,778
Ginjo boss probably
won't come.

90
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,891
Samurai,you're the one that seeks
for a master to protect?As a bodyguard?

91
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,089
Show me what you can do.

92
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,457
Well..

93
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,730
Not the rope.
Look at your leg.

94
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,654
Bone-setter,i'm off to the fields.

95
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,851
Tell me,lady...

96
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,130
Can i do something to help?

97
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,129
Thank you for offering your help...

98
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,730
...but i cannot ask from a blind
man to cut the woods.

99
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,535
Don't you care about it.You get some rest.

100
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,097
My dear...

101
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,293
You came back late last night.

102
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,858
-Anything happened?
-I found a good job.

103
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,413
As a bodyguard again?

104
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,338
I beg you,don't do it for me.

105
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,774
I beg you,stop doing this kind of jobs.

106
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,730
Don't be fool.

107
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,933
With the money you may get well.

108
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,128
Tell me...

109
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,174
You hired that RONIN?

110
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,688
Yes.

111
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,534
We have 2 problems to solve.

112
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,097
We must clean Ijutsu and Funahatsi.

113
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,448
After that the town will be yours,boss.

114
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,932
Try not to be very hard.

115
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,019
Yes.

116
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,251
Don't you worry.

117
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,816
Really...Do you have any news
on the Heihatsi murder?

118
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,929
Some rumours.It is said
that he was kill by a geisa.

119
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,493
That's what we know for now.

120
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,211
A bit more,bone-setter?

121
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,939
No,thank you.

122
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,251
I've had enough.Thanks again.

123
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,935
My lady,while i was cutting woods...

124
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,331
...someone was running round the house.

125
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,731
What was he?

126
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,377
Neighbour's son.
He's crazy with a certificate.

127
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,451
Don't you pay to him.

128
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,897
He imagines that he's a samurai.
He runs like that all day.

129
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,933
Samurai!

130
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,132
So...

131
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,939
-I'll be out for a while.
-For work?

132
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,938
Not exactly.

133
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,973
For this.

134
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,100
What?You gamble?

135
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,176
Better stay away from that.

136
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,650
My nephew is addicted to gambling.

137
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,898
He refuses to work,
he gambles all day.

138
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,177
WHat can i say...
He's lost from the face of the earth.

139
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,534
For me,it's a pleasure.

140
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,449
Some pleasures can be 
very dangerous.

141
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,458
What do u think?

142
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,334
This sword cost me a fortune.

143
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,015
Yes,mr.Oggi,a wonderfull sword.

144
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,978
I will give it back to Lord Sakai.

145
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,853
He will be very please to 
do work with us.

146
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,008
Sure.

147
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,696
I'd say that you test it on the
first beggar that comes by.

148
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,729
-Who?Me?
-Yes,you!

149
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,256
Thanx you,master,
but you better do it.

150
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,055
No way!
I'm not makin my kimono dirty!

151
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,979
You do it!

152
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,051
Why don't you take a RONIN?

153
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,375
You fool!

154
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,810
Hire a RONIN
to test a sword?

155
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,693
-Do as i say!
-But...

156
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,413
Someone's coming!

157
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,292
Slaughter that blind man.

158
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,213
Do it fast!

159
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,778
Are you afraid of a blind man?

160
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,498
My...sword!

161
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,015
I'm sorry!

162
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,249
You fool!

163
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,655
Are we playing!

164
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,051
3 plus 1,even.

165
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,293
New game!

166
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,412
Any objections?

167
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,255
A blind man?

168
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,814
-Sit here,blind man.
-I am a bone-setter.

169
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,817
-Even.
-No more bets.

170
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,332
We're playing.

171
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,091
3 plus 2,odd.

172
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,777
I'm unlucky.

173
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,419
New game.

174
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,014
Any objections?

175
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,939
Any objections?

176
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,299
Odd.

177
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,854
-You don't bet?
-Just watch.for now.

178
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,615
You watch?But you are blind.

179
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,050
1 plus 1,even.

180
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,533
Boss!

181
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,252
The bodyguard is here.

182
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,334
Place your bets.

183
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,809
Odd.

184
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,734
Even.

185
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,053
End of bets.

186
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,489
We're playing.

187
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,331
4 plus 2,even.

188
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,617
Any objections?

189
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,976
Any objections?

190
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,253
Them?

191
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,899
Yes.

192
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,296
Stop!Please,don't!

193
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,973
It's over.

194
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,973
Mr.Oggi's problems
are over for now.

195
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,213
There he is.

196
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,894
A bit of sake..

197
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,528
Old man...

198
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,376
May i have some sake?

199
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,653
Samurai...

200
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,413
Bone-setter...

201
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,328
Your walking stick!I'm sorry.

202
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,449
What a lovely walking stick.

203
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,058
Bone-stter...

204
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,890
I'm not a usual bone-setter.

205
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,295
You also stink blood yourself.

206
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,130
It's a bit uncomfortable in here.

207
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,372
No use pulling your sword like that.

208
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,818
My dear...

209
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,737
You had to kill again?

210
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,009
You fool!

211
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,854
It's a bot early for a fuss like that.

212
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,698
Go home.

213
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,936
The battle is over.

214
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,010
My bone-setter didn't come back last night.

215
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,534
Maybe he found a woman.

216
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,455
OGGI

217
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,739
SIR!

218
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,450
I'm going to Lord Sakai.

219
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,573
Hold on.

220
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,738
On your way back...

221
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,373
...get something tasty to eat.

222
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,459
Thank you,sir!

223
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,375
Next!Kaneko Hishiro!

224
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,931
Some RONIN are really strong.

225
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,816
Hatori will gace them.

226
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,694
You coward!

227
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,013
The art of battle is not the walking stick.

228
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,538
The real samurai uses his sword!

229
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,331
Are you Yamatzi Isaburo?

230
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,459
Yes.

231
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,376
Who are you?

232
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,375
Hatori Genosouke.

233
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,499
I must kill you to regain my honur.

234
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,811
Grab your sword!

235
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,935
Kill me if you want.

236
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,211
I never...

237
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,419
...owned a sword.

238
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,336
Where do you find honour...

239
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,049
..in killing a crippled man like me?

240
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,217
The art of battle is not the walking stick!

241
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,132
A real samurai uses his sword!

242
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,133
He's half-dead.
No point in killing him.

243
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,937
Come,quickly!

244
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,539
Why you're such a rush?

245
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,175
Shut up!I wanted to see you.

246
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,295
It is better like this,ain't it?

247
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,931
2 plus 3,odd.

248
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,059
New game.

249
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,012
Any objections?

250
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,611
Place your bets.

251
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,456
Bet in what?

252
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,053
Odd.

253
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,172
May i join?

254
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,694
Odd!

255
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,379
End of bets.

256
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,053
We're playing.

257
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,290
4 plus 1,odd.

258
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,857
Yes!Here!

259
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,414
Bone-setter...

260
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,850
Its full of beautiful women.

261
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,252
You must win.

262
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,128
Thanks to that bone-setter,
i've gathered a fortune.

263
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,090
SO,you wanna pay for one night with us?

264
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,813
Bone-setter...

265
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,295
Wannna have some fan?

266
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,010
I'll talk to the mistress.

267
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,496
I'll find5-6 geisas.

268
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,091
I'll take care of it,young master.

269
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,538
You stay here.I'll go.

270
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,097
Ah!It hurts!

271
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,697
I am not a rabbit!

272
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,689
Dont'pull my ears!

273
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,772
No violence!

274
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,853
Don't be naughty!

275
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,697
That much?Not possible!

276
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,216
Ah!It hurts!

277
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,291
Can i stand a small needle?

278
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,133
No,the smaller the needle...

279
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,536
...the greater the pain!

280
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,495
Very funny!Come over.

281
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,698
-Drink something.
-Thank you.

282
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,538
Really funny!
Seen that,bone-setter?

283
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,498
Can't see much.

284
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,334
Osei,are you ready to dance?

285
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,936
Dance!Great!

286
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,296
Come on,dance!

287
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,811
Miss Okinu...

288
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,819
...why u pulled out the strings?

289
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,655
You want our money?

290
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,100
And you,miss Osei...

291
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,290
...aren't you a guy?

292
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,690
You don't smell a woman.

293
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,979
Blind men...

294
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,215
are sensitive in that matters.

295
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,376
Hidden sword?

296
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,855
What all these mean?

297
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,211
Bone-setter...

298
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,049
you may think i am lying...

299
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,490
...but i'm gonna tell you the truth.

300
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,331
Our father...

301
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,294
...was a rich rise.

302
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,738
Come and see Snowy.

303
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,458
Don't tell anyone.

304
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,972
Heihatsi...

305
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,538
You pulled through for 7 years.

306
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,377
Heihatsi,where are they hidden?

307
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,815
-Here.
-How many are they?

308
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,018
The Narutos,both their children
3 maids και 4 guys that help them.

309
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,651
Tasitsi,what have u found?

310
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,659
8 safes full of money.
They've gathered a fortune!

311
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,011
Inosuke,we're rich for the rest of our lives!

312
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,211
Call the boss Kutsinawa.

313
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,530
You killed them all?

314
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,099
The kids?

315
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,136
We did'nt find them anywhere.

316
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,778
You full!

317
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,211
We don't have time.Let's go.

318
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,370
We've hunted Heihatsi,the servant.

319
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,293
What are you doing?

320
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,060
You were working for Naruto.
Don't you recognise us?

321
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,011
Of the Naruto family?

322
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,057
I am the daughter!

323
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,454
As far as the others concerned,
i only know their names.

324
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,418
Tell me their names.

325
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,974
Inosuke and Tasitsi.

326
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,577
They also mentioned the boss Kutsinawa.

327
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,291
That's what we know.

328
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,218
And all these years you were searching?

329
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,259
Even.

330
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,057
Wrong again!

331
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,058
I'll try with my eyes closed.
Like him.

332
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,651
How does he do that by only hearing?

333
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,297
I am so unlucky!

334
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,574
One got away!

335
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,857
That's the problem.

336
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,259
Odd.

337
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,532
Even.

338
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,415
I thinkk i got it.

339
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,017
My senses work better with my eyes closed.

340
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,332
Good!

341
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,973
Sinkitsi!

342
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,614
You're sitting with your eyes closed.

343
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,856
Won't you bet?

344
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,170
I 'm listening.

345
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,737
To what;

346
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,853
You're sitting here and listen?

347
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,452
I have the right to hear.

348
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,452
You were asking for it.

349
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,179
Don't play tough on me!

350
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,610
This dump needs customers.

351
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,378
You bastard!

352
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,736
Take it easy,Sinkitsi!

353
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,817
You can listen and bet.

354
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,736
You're calling me with my first name?
You shouldn't be talkin like that to a customer!

355
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,699
Customer?

356
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,776
You used to work for me.

357
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,657
Shut up and bet!

358
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,855
Bad for you.

359
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,889
Last sound was...

360
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,178
OK.

361
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,059
Odd!

362
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,373
Odd.

363
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,292
We're playing.

364
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,015
4 plus 2,even!

365
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,619
So?

366
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,373
Message for your boss.

367
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,575
What?

368
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,572
Go to hell!

369
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,855
-Is miss Ijutsu here?
-One moment,please.

370
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,252
May i ask what are youlooking for here?

371
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,060
Your late husband
owes money from gambling.

372
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,531
I am taking your store.

373
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,333
You got 3 days to go.

374
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,413
Not a day more.

375
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,971
-this is madness!
-Shut up!

376
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,253
Don't get involved ni our business!

377
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,611
You see those dolls?

378
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,738
-You know them?
-No.

379
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,137
I wish i new them!
The red one is hot.

380
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,817
Some more sake,please.

381
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,979
Osei...

382
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,296
Should we ask for job?

383
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,538
Sir...

384
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,579
You know if we can offer
our services anywhere?

385
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,897
We don't have jobs.
-You know anyone?

386
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,657
You can try at Mr.Oggi.

387
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,930
He's in charge now,
thanks to Ginjo.

388
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,651
To that mr.Oggi...

389
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,697
Can u introduce us to him?

390
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,976
Old man,help the ladies.

391
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,491
Grandfather,go find Oggi.

392
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,934
Go yourself,you bastard!
Don't take advantage of the old man!

393
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,618
Fast!

394
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,170
I present you the windmill!

395
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,816
Look how it spins.

396
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,018
Boss!

397
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,217
The tavern owner introduces
you to two geisas.

398
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,650
They are free tonight.

399
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,892
Great.Send them.

400
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,177
You two,go away!

401
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,772
Lord Sakai,in a while we will have
2 lovely geisas for company.

402
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,849
Fast.

403
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,419
What time are we playing?

404
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,208
Even.

405
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,934
Even!

406
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,653
End of bets.

407
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,455
We're playing.

408
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,299
5 plus 3,even.

409
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,019
I won!

410
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,779
Oggi!

411
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,097
I have to watch this for a long time?

412
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,411
Lets watch some dancing.

413
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,615
The show is over.Go away!

414
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,695
Time to dance,ladies.

415
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,779
Quickly!Dance!

416
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,933
Odd.

417
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,851
End of bets.

418
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,374
We're playing.

419
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,378
4 plus 1,odd.

420
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,013
Bone-setter,
should we bet everything?

421
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,579
New game.

422
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,658
Any objections?

423
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,933
Eh!

424
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,808
The dice don't sound the same.

425
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,773
You damn bone-setter!

426
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,534
Master.

427
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,255
A bone-setter has turned the club upside-down.

428
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,775
Boss wants you to go.

429
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,493
A bone-setter?

430
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,492
Please,sir.

431
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,014
Let's go.

432
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,659
Leave me.

433
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,373
Come on.

434
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,088
Do as he says!

435
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,579
Don't touch me!

436
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,379
Are you ok?

437
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,658
Be careful where you're stepping at.

438
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,058
Watch out!

439
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,133
What are youlooking at?

440
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,413
Bone-setter...

441
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,009
Wait here.
I go see what's happening.

442
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,408
Ah!

443
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,497
Girls,this way!

444
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,499
Quickly!

445
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,578
That Oggi guy is horrible!

446
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,577
I hit him and we left when 
the customer went to take Osei.

447
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,298
We had troubles in Ginjo store.

448
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,415
But the bone-setter had put
everybody to the ground.

449
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,738
It was unbelievable.
Who are you,anyway?

450
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,733
If we stay here,they'll find us shortly .

451
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,297
Lets go to my aunt's.

452
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,533
Not possible.Ginjo's men
are all over the place.

453
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,129
That's true.

454
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,577
I have an idea.
Okinu,you got any make-up?

455
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,413
Of course.

456
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,291
Bone-setter,come here.

457
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,579
Don't move.

458
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,492
-What is it?
-I paint eyes.

459
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,418
For me?

460
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,819
open!

461
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,136
Who's that this kind of hour?

462
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,939
-Who's that?
-Your nephew,Sinkitsi.

463
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,817
He probaly lost everything again.

464
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,893
Come in.

465
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,018
Who are these guys?

466
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,613
Watch out,bone-setter.

467
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,657
-Bone-setter!
-Yes,its me.

468
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,339
You are useless!

469
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,451
What happened to the bodyguard?

470
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:06,013
Everything was over when he came.
The bone-setter was allready gone.

471
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,809
Who's that bone-setter?

472
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,291
Don't really know.A bone-setter.

473
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,450
That punk,Sinkitsi,was with him.

474
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,574
He often goes the club.

475
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,933
It wouldn't be hard to track him.

476
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:27,452
We'll get the bone-setter too.

477
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,694
Firstly we must make the Funahatsi
gang extinct.

478
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,690
Don't you say...

479
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,129
We were suddenly going from town to town.

480
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,412
Cheating men and robbing them.

481
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,409
Ten years?

482
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,216
These punks must live differently now.

483
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,653
Hold on.

484
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,494
Wasn't Oggi here ten years ago?

485
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,418
Right.

486
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,694
Indeed,that Oggi...
Something's not right about him.

487
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,854
I saw his arm.

488
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,409
He has a snake tattoo.

489
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,097
One moment...

490
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,331
The names u just told...

491
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,538
You mentined someone named Kutsinawa?

492
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,414
Yes,right.

493
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,812
Kutsinawa means "rotten rope".

494
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,410
Maybe it means snake.

495
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,737
Right;

496
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,051
Bone setter!

497
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,095
Don't look me with these eyes!

498
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,060
I've heard about last night.

499
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:17,817
A bone-setter ruined your store.

500
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,658
Yes.

501
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,698
We run with the bodyguard.

502
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,295
But we were late.

503
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,177
Oggi...

504
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,129
How were those ladies?

505
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,654
Lord Sakai tried to take one.

506
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,293
But the other one hit me hard.

507
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,974
The way i saw them acting...

508
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,859
...i am sure they are not real geisas.

509
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:49,892
Listen...

510
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,093
Learn anything you can about 
that bone-setter and the geisas.

511
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,013
We're playing.

512
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,251
Even.

513
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,418
Odd.

514
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,412
I won.

515
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,212
This is my home.
Go!Go away!

516
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,699
You're still eating?

517
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,256
I told you to clean up!

518
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,456
Young Seitaro,
master wants to see you.

519
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,768
You,clean up this mess!

520
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,896
Come with me,Seitaro.

521
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,889
You are so lovely!

522
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,172
from now on you will be my boy.

523
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,818
If you do what i say...

524
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:57,452
...your sister and you are
welcome to live here.

525
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,698
You want to live here?
I'll buy you some beautiful kimonos.

526
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:09,775
What are you doing there?

527
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,499
Stay away from the master's room!

528
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,129
No!

529
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,409
Sir...

530
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:55,889
You want to spent some time with me?

531
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,293
Osei...

532
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,091
Time for practise.

533
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,412
Sister...

534
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,371
WHat's wrong?

535
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,209
Nothing.

536
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,331
Are you ok?

537
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:56,493
Aunt,you have an umbrela?

538
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,332
Over there.

539
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,970
I'm going to see what's happening downtown.

540
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,414
Thank you.

541
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,939
Grandfather,where is the old man today?

542
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:18,529
He had something to take care of.

543
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:22,575
That dull man?

544
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:26,849
Why you're working in this dump?
Don't have any family?

545
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,898
Exactly.

546
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:33,496
He picked me from the streets
and offered my a job.

547
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:36,370
I was treated good.

548
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,609
I'm thankful for what he hs done for me.

549
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:46,496
It's better begging than working in here!

550
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:52,008
If you sit outside in the ground,
you'll earn more for sure.

551
01:12:07,311 --> 01:12:09,063
5 plus 1,even.

552
01:12:16,311 --> 01:12:17,630
New game.

553
01:12:19,311 --> 01:12:21,063
Any ojections?

554
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:37,586
What are you doing here,bastards?

555
01:12:38,311 --> 01:12:40,188
Pay,if you wanna play.

556
01:12:40,311 --> 01:12:41,426
Watch out.

557
01:12:42,311 --> 01:12:44,029
We were here first.

558
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,949
You're looking for trouble,bastard?

559
01:12:56,311 --> 01:12:57,505
You're looking for trouble?

560
01:13:10,311 --> 01:13:14,224
Ginjo wants to compete.

561
01:13:38,311 --> 01:13:39,585
Stay back.

562
01:14:30,231 --> 01:14:31,664
Oh my God!

563
01:15:01,311 --> 01:15:02,744
Hold on...

564
01:15:07,311 --> 01:15:09,029
It's over.

565
01:15:27,311 --> 01:15:29,461
That bone-setter...

566
01:15:29,551 --> 01:15:31,621
Do u think he's Zatoichi?

567
01:15:33,311 --> 01:15:35,779
And that geisas...

568
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:38,427
..must be from the Naruto family.

569
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:41,347
Naruto's taking down...

570
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,983
When did this happen?

571
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:47,506
Ten years ago.

572
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:50,790
I see.

573
01:15:52,311 --> 01:15:55,701
If the kids survive,
they must be grownups now.

574
01:16:00,351 --> 01:16:01,943
I wonder...

575
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:05,461
That bodyguard...

576
01:16:05,551 --> 01:16:08,145
' ' '
...is he capable of winning
Zatoichi?

577
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:24,790
Where is Oggi?

578
01:16:57,311 --> 01:16:58,949
Boss Ginjo himself!

579
01:16:59,311 --> 01:17:00,903
I'm glad you came!

580
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,710
This way please.

581
01:17:07,311 --> 01:17:09,302
I've heard your business go well.

582
01:17:11,311 --> 01:17:14,223
-I told you not to come here.
-don't worry.

583
01:17:15,271 --> 01:17:18,502
Funahatsis are past.
We're in charge now.

584
01:17:19,311 --> 01:17:22,030
The only thing left is to
make our pockets full.

585
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:32,784
Clean up in here!

586
01:17:47,311 --> 01:17:48,744
Great news!

587
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,822
Funahatsi gang is extincted.

588
01:17:51,311 --> 01:17:54,747
Ginjo gang and the bodyguard
slaughtered them all.

589
01:17:58,311 --> 01:18:02,065
That Ginjo guy pays for that
tromendous bodyguard!

590
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:07,428
Bone-setter,you better
don't go to the town.

591
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:13,862
Sinkitsi,that bodyguard is
really so strong?

592
01:18:14,311 --> 01:18:16,302
He's unbelievable.

593
01:18:18,271 --> 01:18:22,787
If we had to face each other at night,
who would be the winner?

594
01:18:26,311 --> 01:18:29,940
If it was so dark,
noone would see a thing.

595
01:18:30,311 --> 01:18:32,586
The winner would be probably you.

596
01:18:42,311 --> 01:18:45,109
You think it's funny?

597
01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:50,940
Let's see you now.
I'll train you.Come!

598
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:54,427
I'teach you the art of battle.

599
01:18:57,311 --> 01:18:59,188
Concentrate.

600
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:01,823
We start.

601
01:19:03,311 --> 01:19:05,267
Attack from all sides.

602
01:19:10,311 --> 01:19:12,620
Not all at the same time!

603
01:19:14,311 --> 01:19:15,903
Let's try again.

604
01:19:16,311 --> 01:19:19,109
For safety,let's plan the moves.
Listen to me.

605
01:19:21,231 --> 01:19:22,425
Me first...

606
01:19:22,511 --> 01:19:23,466
Like that...

607
01:19:24,311 --> 01:19:25,983
You hit here.

608
01:19:28,311 --> 01:19:29,585
Then...

609
01:19:30,311 --> 01:19:32,745
...you!

610
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:35,620
And then,you.

611
01:19:35,711 --> 01:19:37,190
Good.

612
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:39,541
Let's try.

613
01:19:41,391 --> 01:19:42,710
You see?

614
01:19:47,231 --> 01:19:50,780
You see what you can do?
Faster now.

615
01:19:54,311 --> 01:19:56,871
Good.That's it!

616
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:02,460
Not like that!

617
01:20:02,551 --> 01:20:03,984
It hurts,you fool!

618
01:20:04,311 --> 01:20:06,586
End of leston.

619
01:20:09,311 --> 01:20:10,790
You jerks!

620
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:19,063
What are you doing

621
01:20:19,311 --> 01:20:21,108
You fool!Go home!

622
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:34,267
-I'll have a bath.
-Me too.

623
01:20:35,311 --> 01:20:37,188
No!Men first.

624
01:20:37,311 --> 01:20:39,506
I'm a man myself!

625
01:20:58,311 --> 01:20:59,983
Bone-setter...

626
01:21:01,311 --> 01:21:04,621
I'm thinkin of paying a visit to Oggi,again.

627
01:21:10,311 --> 01:21:13,860
I have to know if he was one of the thiefs.

628
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:25,030
Water is cold.Boil it better!

629
01:21:25,311 --> 01:21:27,666
Don't get on my nervers!Ain't it too much
allready you bathing yourself at daylight!

630
01:21:28,311 --> 01:21:29,869
You're useless!

631
01:21:30,311 --> 01:21:32,586
It isnt good cold.
Please,boil it a bit more.

632
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:34,389
That's what i'm doing!

633
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:43,546
I confess it's unbelievable.

634
01:21:43,631 --> 01:21:46,270
You really look like a woman.

635
01:21:47,311 --> 01:21:49,745
Make-up makes men more beautiful?

636
01:21:51,311 --> 01:21:53,620
Not all.

637
01:21:54,311 --> 01:21:56,586
Depends on the face.

638
01:22:37,311 --> 01:22:38,949
Welcome.

639
01:22:44,231 --> 01:22:47,780
We wanna ask sorry
from mr.Oggi.

640
01:22:48,311 --> 01:22:52,065
He paid us to dance for him and
we treated him disrespectful.

641
01:22:52,311 --> 01:22:53,630
Really?

642
01:22:54,311 --> 01:22:57,144
Can you tell him we said sorry?

643
01:22:58,311 --> 01:22:59,664
Sit down.

644
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:04,462
Oggi drinks too much.He probably 
has allready forgotten abou it.

645
01:23:05,311 --> 01:23:07,984
-Don't you worry.
-I hope you're right.

646
01:23:09,311 --> 01:23:11,620
We haven't see you lately.

647
01:23:12,311 --> 01:23:15,144
-Where do you live?
-At ms.Ume's house.

648
01:23:17,271 --> 01:23:19,068
Is there a bone-setter living with you?

649
01:23:25,311 --> 01:23:27,506
Are you allright,grandfather?

650
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:33,024
Throw'em out.

651
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:41,142
drink something.

652
01:23:42,311 --> 01:23:43,585
Thank you.

653
01:23:45,231 --> 01:23:49,224
Oggi and Ginjo are friends now.
They are preparing something.

654
01:23:50,311 --> 01:23:52,461
But their job has nothing
to do with you.

655
01:23:53,351 --> 01:23:54,670
One more?

656
01:23:55,311 --> 01:23:56,744
Not yet.

657
01:24:01,311 --> 01:24:04,986
I'm off to Oggi's.
I'll be late.

658
01:24:05,311 --> 01:24:06,903
You wait here.

659
01:24:56,311 --> 01:24:59,587
Oggi says he's not angry at all.

660
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:02,231
He likes you and wants to see you both.

661
01:25:02,311 --> 01:25:04,029
thanx you very much.

662
01:25:04,311 --> 01:25:06,222
Thank you for the sake.

663
01:25:08,311 --> 01:25:09,903
Good luck.

664
01:25:20,311 --> 01:25:22,506
Where are the others?

665
01:25:23,311 --> 01:25:25,586
They 're off to the city.

666
01:25:28,391 --> 01:25:30,268
What are youdoing over there?

667
01:25:34,311 --> 01:25:36,620
Are you mad?

668
01:25:38,231 --> 01:25:41,029
I wanna be beautiful,like Osei.

669
01:25:41,311 --> 01:25:42,630
What are you craving for!

670
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:26,869
What's all this fuss?

671
01:27:27,311 --> 01:27:28,824
You're back,silly kid?

672
01:27:31,311 --> 01:27:33,905
-Where is the bone-setter?
-Who are you?

673
01:27:34,271 --> 01:27:36,102
We want the bone-setter.

674
01:27:36,311 --> 01:27:38,700
-He's not here.
-You cannot hide him from us.

675
01:27:39,311 --> 01:27:40,585
But he's not here.

676
01:27:42,311 --> 01:27:44,381
We''ll burn down the house and he will appear.

677
01:27:44,471 --> 01:27:46,109
Burn it!

678
01:27:47,311 --> 01:27:48,539

689
01:29:44,311 --> 01:29:46,506
Thinks are not alwys what they
seem too be,Inosouke.

690
01:29:46,591 --> 01:29:50,743
Don't use that old name.
The walls have ears here.

691

Myname now is Ginjo.

Keep dancing.

694
01:30:06,311 --> 01:30:08,461
We know it all.

695
01:30:08,551 --> 01:30:11,304
You're Naruto's kids.

696
01:31:05,231 --> 01:31:07,791
-Bone-setter!
-Girls,go now.

697
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:24,790

Inosouke,where are you heading at?

699
01:32:58,391 --> 01:33:00,063
-Where is the bodyguard?

01:33:00,311 --> 01:33:01,903

On top of mama-turtle
goes the baby-turtle.

703
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:47,143
On top of baby-turtle
goes the baby-baby-turtle.

704
01:36:47,311 --> 01:36:49,905
On top of baby-turtle
goes the baby-baby-baby-turtle.

705
01:36:50,311 --> 01:36:51,630
Mama-turtle goes down...

706
01:36:52,311 --> 01:36:54,222
...baby-turtle goes down,baby-baby-turtle

707
01:37:53,311 --> 01:37:55,029
All the thiefs are dead.

708
01:37:58,311 --> 01:38:00,108
Except boss Kutsinawa.

709
01:38:02,311 --> 01:38:05,030
He must be really old now.

710
01:38:06,351 --> 01:38:08,501
He'll be dead shortly anyway.

711
01:38:11,231 --> 01:38:14,746
Don't think about him.
You better think about your future.

712
01:38:18,311 --> 01:38:21,030
You can stay here.

713
01:38:22,311 --> 01:38:24,427
You can become a man again.

714
01:38:25,351 --> 01:38:27,501
I'm fine as i am now.

715
01:38:33,311 --> 01:38:35,506
Where is the bone setter?

716
01:38:37,311 --> 01:38:40,189
He must be somewhere around here.

717
01:38:43,311 --> 01:38:45,108
But the fest starts today.

718
01:39:57,311 --> 01:39:59,188
You found me.

719
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:00,983
How did you know?

720
01:40:02,311 --> 01:40:03,790
Bitch.

721
01:40:05,311 --> 01:40:07,142
You may change as much as u want...

722
01:40:07,311 --> 01:40:09,506
...this awful smell will always stay the same.

723
01:40:10,311 --> 01:40:12,905
Stop bullshitting,blind man!

724
01:40:14,311 --> 01:40:17,667
I proudly accept that i am 
boss Kutsinawa.

725
01:40:19,311 --> 01:40:21,586
A blind man like yourself...

726
01:40:21,671 --> 01:40:23,468
...Will not slaughter me easily!

727
01:40:30,311 --> 01:40:33,508
WHat the hell!You're not blind?

728
01:40:33,591 --> 01:40:36,981
-Not at all.
-Thwn why you pretend to be blind?

729
01:40:39,311 --> 01:40:42,906
Cause blind men can 
sense the world better.

730
01:42:40,311 --> 01:42:42,142
I knew you could see!

731
01:42:42,311 --> 01:42:45,064
I knew it from the first
time you came here.

732
01:42:46,311 --> 01:42:48,506
You killed my men.

733
01:42:49,311 --> 01:42:51,541
And Torakitsi

734
01:42:52,311 --> 01:42:54,142
You kille dthe tavern man..

735
01:42:57,311 --> 01:43:02,669
It was a kid from the streets.
I picked him up many years ago.

736
01:43:04,271 --> 01:43:08,583
I taught him the business so
he could be my successor.

737
01:43:09,271 --> 01:43:11,341
All my gang is gone...

738
01:43:11,431 --> 01:43:14,662
...from a wandering
bone-setter like yourself.

739
01:43:22,311 --> 01:43:26,543
How did u know that i was the
real boss Kutsinawa;

740
01:43:29,311 --> 01:43:32,701
From the time you threw your walking
stick, to see the sword.

741
01:43:34,311 --> 01:43:36,984
Your the worst
gangster of all.

742
01:43:38,311 --> 01:43:40,267
Really;

743
01:43:41,231 --> 01:43:44,701
I m like a cripple now.
My retirement time has arrived.

744
01:43:46,311 --> 01:43:49,109
But i lived a full life.

745
01:43:51,311 --> 01:43:53,222
I regret for nothing.

746
01:43:55,311 --> 01:43:57,506
Come on, kill me!

747
01:44:05,311 --> 01:44:07,541
U dont deserve death.

748
01:44:07,631 --> 01:44:10,464
Finish your life as blind man!

749
01:47:55,311 --> 01:47:57,745
Even with my eyes
wide open...

750
01:47:58,311 --> 01:48:00,745
... I can't see anything!

751
01:48:03,231 --> 01:48:06,029
