1
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We lost 300 gold pieces,
thanks to your meddling.

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,240
I can't go back empty-handed.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,360
You won't have to go back
completely empty-handed. Bite?

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Is it true they hired you
for only twenty gold pieces?

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,240
Yes.

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,600
The sword we stole was
a treasure given to them by the Shogun.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,120
And they'll only pay twenty
pieces to get it back?

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You fool!

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They're a poor,
small clan.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,720
Trying to swindle 300 gold pieces
for a sword is asking too much.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,720
You're the fool.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,640
- Shut up! Damn you!

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,600
Looks like a nasty
storm's brewing...

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,080
Can't waste my time here!

15
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,560
Hello there.

16
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That was one terrible storm!

17
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It sure was! The roof got blown off
and scared my wife so bad...

18
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
that she went into labor.

19
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It was really something.

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's your seventh kid, right?

21
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,600
No, my ninth.

22
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,320
You must really love your wife!

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,160
Isn't that Sakichi's daughter
from Shimoda Village?

24
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,960
What's wrong with her?

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
Are you sick?

26
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
All...dead...

27
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,880
All dead in Shimoda.

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,320
Dead?!

29
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,640
Plague...
A great evil force has come.

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,800
Don't go near her!

31
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,880
This area's off limits!
No one goes through!

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This highway's closed
until the epidemic is over.

33
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,480
Epidemic?!

34
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,520
What is it?

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,840
Sir, my scout saw
a strange group of men...

36
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
ride toward Shimoda Village
late last night.

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It might have something
to do with this epidemic...

38
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,640
so I came to tell you,
Chamberlain.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,800
Meaning what?
That they spread a plague...

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,640
as they passed
through the village?

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,680
Preposterous!
Don't even waste my time!

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
Something's fishy.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Let it alone.

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,640
Yes, sir.
l just thought I'd tell you.

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
On second thought,
we can't.

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is the order to all
of you in the Koga ninja team.

47
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,200
Go to Shimoda Village and
find what really happened.

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Sir!

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,240
One more thing. If any of
your people get infected...

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Understood, sir.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,640
The first group will follow the
Shirakawa River from the north.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,960
The second will cross
Taro Pass from the west.

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You'll reach Shimoda Village
in about an hour. Understand?

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,360
Hikoza saw them. There were only eight.
No match for us.

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,720
Our real enemy is
this epidemic disease.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,720
Hardly worth it.

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Kagero...

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,760
Why are you here?

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,600
You intend to leave
me behind, Hanza?

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
You have your
own duties, don't you?

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,200
Poison tasting is very important.
Don't forget that.

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,720
While our lord is away from his domain,
the work isn't necessary.

63
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Until he returns...
l am one of the Koga ninja!

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But it is too dangerous.

65
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,480
You all could be
killed out there.

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How can l...

67
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,440
just sit and
wait here alone?!

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,560
Kagero's gotten
even more beautiful.

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,400
All the more
reason to pity her.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's her destiny.
She must hate it.

71
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,720
Enough. Where are
Hikoza and the others?

72
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,880
They were right behind us.
I'lI have a look.

73
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,040
Hey! What are you doing?

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
What the...?!

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,320
There!

76
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,440
Damn you!

77
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,800
Kagero, get back and
tell the chamberlain!

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,880
While you still can!

79
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,680
Shut up, and perhaps I'll let you
live just a little bit longer.

80
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,200
Don't think that I wouldn't mind
raping a dead girl.

81
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,640
That's better.

82
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,080
I'm busy here.
Get lost!

83
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,840
Didn't you hear me?

84
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,640
The highway's out and I had
to make a detour, but now I'm lost.

85
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,560
Can you tell me
how to get to Kakio?

86
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,560
My best hat!

87
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,040
I warned you to get out.

88
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Forget it. Once I get
rid of this meddler...

89
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,440
I'll take my
time killing you.

90
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,280
What's wrong? Sorry you
didn't run when I told you to?

91
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,600
No, just thinking...
About your body.

92
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,760
Your body can't be
rock hard everywhere!

93
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,400
Move it!

94
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,280
Jump!

95
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,360
Tessai!

96
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,480
You are indeed a sorry sight.
But no need to pursue him so.

97
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll kill him!

98
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,760
No, you shan't.
Don't forget our mission.

99
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,680
Consider my word
as Lord Gemma's order.

100
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,520
Understood?

101
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,560
Shall we go?

102
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,840
Who was that freak?

103
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Forget it. I don't want
to see him again, anyway.

104
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,160
I'm grateful to you.
l am Kagero of the Koga ninja.

105
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,760
Jubei. Kibagami Jubei.
Are you all right?

106
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't need your concern!

107
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,280
The town of Kakio is in the west.
Our paths part here.

108
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Who is it?

109
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,560
Kagero of the Koga.
There's trouble.

110
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
What's wrong?

111
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Twenty ninja led by Hanza
attempted to infiltrate...

112
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,480
Shimoda Village a little
while ago. They were wiped out.

113
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,600
Really? All of them?
Who killed them?

114
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,280
A very formidable opponent.
Beyond that, I cannot say.

115
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,920
Useless, all of them.

116
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,280
And you're
the only survivor?

117
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

118
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Until we learn who he is
and what he's up to...

119
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,360
we can't risk sending our
men to that plague village.

120
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,680
is THIS way!

121
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,240
Ow... Okay, it's out of your
system. Are we even now?

122
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,080
Not yet. I still owe you.

123
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,960
That's just excessive.

124
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,960
If we keep this up,
one of us is going to die.

125
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,640
"One of us?"

126
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,880
There's no reason we
should kill each other.

127
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,800
If you're not going
to end this...l will!

128
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,480
Like hell!

129
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,120
Strange skill you have.
But it can't hurt my body.

130
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,680
Seems that way.

131
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,320
What's wrong, monster?
Your skin's starting to crumble!

132
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,240
Die!

133
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,240
Splendid! Your sword flew
swift as the wind itself...

134
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,080
and slashed your enemy
like a cyclone's touch.

135
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
He was no match for you.
Why don't you join me?

136
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,800
Your skills will be of great help for me
to fight the likes of him.

137
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,520
You're joking. Who'd want to
fight a monster like him again?

138
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,520
You act as if you have a choice.
They won't leave you alone.

139
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
You've just killed one of
the Eight Devils of Kimon.

140
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,720
You didn't beat him
by yourself, though.

141
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,360
That Koga ninja woman...
lnteresting technique she uses.

142
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,040
Lord Gemma. Everything
is proceeding as planned.

143
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,640
It arrives from the Shogun of the Dark
by six tomorrow evening.

144
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,480
Very well.
Write to him in return.

145
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,520
"We return in three days.
There's nothing to worry about".

146
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,400
At once.

147
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Isn't Tessai back yet, Zakuro?

148
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Benisato went to look for him.
We're all alone.

149
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,480
Yurimaru...
I've always loved you.

150
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't need your love.

151
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,200
You're of no interest to me.
Now go and stand watch.

152
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,640
So, it's true.

153
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,080
May your dreams be pleasant
ones in Gemma's arms.

154
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,440
However, Yurimaru, Gemma makes
love to both men and women.

155
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,640
Do you know he makes
love to Benisato?

156
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,680
Apparently not.

157
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,320
Where are you headed, stranger?

158
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,240
No place in particular.
You?

159
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,600
I'm looking for somebody, and
you look exactly like him, so...

160
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,400
Strangers can look alike.
I'm Kibagami Jubei, a wanderer.

161
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It was most
certainly your face.

162
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,880
Tessai was able to make
an impression of it.

163
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,040
His death is your fault.

164
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,240
Die!

165
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,440
Weave your spells on someone else!

166
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,720
A cast-off skin.

167
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,600
She shed it like
a snake and escaped.

168
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,320
A gang of freaks,
one and all.

169
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,360
You've no obligation. I just
didn't want you to die yet.

170
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,560
Who are these
Eight Devils of Kimon?

171
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
A group of ninja who work for
the Shogun of the Dark.

172
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You know of
the Shogun of the Dark?

173
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
He wants to rebuild the House
of Toyotomi, the ex-ruler of Japan.

174
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,720
He has 16 lords behind him
and is trying to expand his influence.

175
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,160
The most dangerous enemy
of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

176
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,440
His power is supported in the shadows
by the Eight Devils.

177
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,640
What are they up to
here in Mochizuki?

178
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,280
That's what I came here to
find out. It's a tough job.

179
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Why don't you work for me,
for 100 gold pieces?

180
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,600
A Tokugawa spy wants
to hire a ninja?

181
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm afraid I have no choice.
It's an emergency.

182
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,880
Only I managed to make
it here to Mochizuki.

183
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The Eight Devils killed everyone else
in my party on our way here.

184
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I need your
help by all means!

185
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
You'll never get away
from them.

186
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You'lI have to fight
them sooner or later.

187
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,280
Join me. You can kill
two birds with one stone, right?

188
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,360
I don't think so.
Now why don't you just leave me alone?

189
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,680
I see. Too bad.

190
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,640
Such a pity...

191
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,160
Such a young man,
throwing away his life like this.

192
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,720
You're stubborn.

193
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,840
No, what I speak of is literally
of life or death importance to you.

194
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,280
You see, the point of that
throwing star was poisoned.

195
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It won't kill you instantly,
but in a day and a night...

196
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
when it starts to work,
nothing can stop it.

197
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,360
Unless you get the antidote.
And only I know what it is.

198
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Work for me and I'll tell you
the antidote along with the...

199
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,880
hundred gold pieces
when the job is done.

200
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,720
You're bluffing.

201
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,800
I speak the truth.

202
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,440
Tell me now.
What's the antidote?

203
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,600
Not until you work for me.
Kill me and you've killed yourself.

204
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Now you'll need
the antidote for yourself.

205
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,560
Poor boy...
You've so much to learn.

206
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,400
That isn't the one
that hit you.

207
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,960
I threw THAT one away.

208
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,280
Shit!

209
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,720
Kibagami Jubei...
You've lost...amateur!

210
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,440
My name is Dakuan.
How do you do?

211
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So, Benisato...

212
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,680
This man, Kibagami Jubei,
is a remnant of the Shogunate's spies?

213
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Possibly.

214
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,040
Why didn't you kill him?

215
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Someone interfered.

216
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,520
No excuses!

217
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,120
If he's a government spy,
he'll show up here soon.

218
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Be sure to kill him
next time!

219
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,560
I don't need
your advice to do that.

220
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,480
Yurimaru... I'll tell Gemma
about this in bed. Do you mind?

221
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,520
Not at all.

222
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Jubei...

223
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,640
There's something
I've been wondering.

224
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Are you, by any chance,
the ninja who killed...

225
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
the chief retainers
of the Yamashiro clan five years ago?

226
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
He was supposedly
a master swordsman, like you.

227
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
The retainers who were killed
had gorged themselves with gold...

228
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,800
they secretly dug
out of a hidden mine.

229
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The ninja must have killed them
by order of the lord...

230
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
who wanted to report to
the government about the mine.

231
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Because if the government found
the hidden gold mine first...

232
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
the lord would have
lost his fief.

233
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,680
But does that ninja know that
after the retainers were killed...

234
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,200
the government received
no report about the mine?

235
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,160
Why? If a government spy
like you knows all that...

236
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,520
then why don't
you do something?

237
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,640
No... Even the government can't
move without definite evidence.

238
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,200
Our spies tried many times
to infiltrate the clan...

239
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,920
to find evidence,
but none returned alive.

240
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
The Shogun of the Dark...

241
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,760
He stopped them by
using the Kimon ninja.

242
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,400
Why is the Shogun of the Dark
helping the Yamashiro clan?

243
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,840
Simple. He wants
the gold mine for himself.

244
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,560
Do you know how he found the gold mine
before the government?

245
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,800
Because somebody gave him
the information.

246
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,640
Somebody who was the leader of the ninja
of the Yamashiro clan.

247
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,720
Himuro...Gemma?!

248
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,480
Precisely.

249
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,920
I doubt that. He isn't
in this world anymore.

250
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,360
No, he's still very much alive.
And you'lI see him soon.

251
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Himuro Gemma is the boss
of the Kimon monsters.

252
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
What?!

253
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,760
Shh! Not so loud!

254
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You can't trick me
the same way again!

255
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,840
Don't be hasty.
You'll soon know the truth.

256
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,360
But you must admit that you
and he share a strange fate.

257
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,480
Stop! You'd kill
your own friend?!

258
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,800
- The lord orders it!
- As did our leader!

259
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's a trick! Now that we know
the traitors' secret...

260
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,480
they want to get rid of us
by making us kill each other.

261
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,160
This is a trap for all of us.
Shinkuro, believe me!

262
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,880
Jubei... Forgive me.

263
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,440
Shinkuro!

264
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
His word...

265
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,480
is law!

266
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,480
I avenged Shinkuro and others
myself. Gemma can't be alive.

267
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,640
We're getting close. This place
is thick with ghosts and blood.

268
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,040
Beyond lies hell itself.

269
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,840
Heaven must have sent
this mist to help us.

270
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,240
Hey!

271
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,720
Where did he go?

272
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,160
Stinking, godforsaken mist!

273
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,720
How could he have
dodged Shijima's claw?

274
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,560
Who are you?

275
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I heard a voice
chanting the sutra.

276
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,600
I was praying for
the dead villagers.

277
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,200
Don't you know an epidemic
is plaguing this village?

278
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,080
Poor soul! You'll never
leave this village alive.

279
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,160
Here now, let us go to
the land of Buddha together.

280
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,560
Have you seen
a traveling monk here?

281
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,160
He'll meet Buddha soon enough.
I'll send him there.

282
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,040
Such a benevolent nun...

283
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,240
Shit!
Another cast-off skin!

284
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,640
Gone... He uses
a strange technique...

285
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,360
As do you.
Very strange indeed!

286
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,440
Answer me. Are there any others
with you besides the monk?

287
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,640
Of course.
And not just ten or twenty.

288
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,240
You can send a snake for each
and it won't be enough.

289
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,280
Liar!

290
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,520
All right!
I'll tell you the truth.

291
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,160
There's two. One's the traveling monk.
The other...

292
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
is right behind you.

293
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,640
Lose the snakes.
Down to the last one!

294
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,880
You'll be dead soon.

295
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,720
Get rid of them!

296
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Now it's your turn to answer.

297
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,760
What are you doing
in this village? Talk!

298
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,200
Twice failed.
Unforgivable.

299
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,440
I cast another line onto your neck,
but you didn't notice.

300
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,520
In the end,
just a foolish amateur.

301
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Idiot! There's still time
to suck the poison out!

302
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,120
Poison doesn't work on me.
My body's immune to it.

303
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I think I've cleared
my debt to you.

304
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,800
Yes. You saved me.

305
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,360
Your name's Kagero, right?
What are you going to do now?

306
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,200
That's none of your concern.

307
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,080
If it isn't, then what
the hell am I doing here?!

308
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,280
I have to discover their plan.

309
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,040
By yourself? lmpossible!

310
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
They're too strong.
Think this over.

311
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,840
Stay out of my way.

312
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,680
I've no reason to
take orders from you.

313
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Hold a moment,
ninja woman of Koga.

314
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,760
My name is Dakuan.
Why don't you join us?

315
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,600
This man is
my trustworthy assistant.

316
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,960
I wasn't planning on
helping a government spy.

317
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,920
Oh, quit complaining!

318
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
What do you say, woman?

319
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,320
Our aims may differ, but we
three share a common enemy.

320
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,360
And three is mightier
than one.

321
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And I happen to have some
information you don't know.

322
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,720
Such as who is giving them
their orders.

323
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,080
I'll tell you on the way.

324
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I need no friends.

325
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,400
But I may need
your information.

326
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,480
Very well.

327
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,080
My, she's a lovely,
sexy little thing, isn't she!

328
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
What's running through
that twisted skull of yours?

329
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,120
Well now, that ninja girl
could prove very useful.

330
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,280
She has a technique to poison
the man she sleeps with.

331
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,040
The big guy you killed
had been poisoned by her.

332
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,480
Anyone who makes
love to her dies.

333
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,680
A perfect woman
for this hellish world.

334
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Your skill is as marvelous as ever.

335
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
No... He was able to kill
a mighty ninja like Tessai.

336
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,960
Don't be off guard.
It's possible he got away.

337
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
The four of you
will check it out.

338
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You're a cautious one,
Yurimaru.

339
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,880
We have an important mission.
We take every precaution.

340
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I know, I know.
Don't worry.

341
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,400
Then go.

342
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,200
Yurimaru, Benisato's death...
How fortunate for you!

343
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Only things he killed were the fish.

344
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Good. Otherwise we
wouldn't get our chance.

345
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's getting quite
interesting, isn't it?

346
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
They poisoned the wells
and killed the villagers.

347
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,800
And then blamed it
on an epidemic disease.

348
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,120
This was their method
of keeping the curious away.

349
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,080
They're planning something...
very extraordinary.

350
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'd like to
know what it is.

351
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,400
That's fine. Just don't get
yourseIf involved too deeply.

352
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,920
It could prove fatal.

353
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,400
I see. Guide the others.

354
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Run for it!

355
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,920
We can't outrun them.

356
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,440
Kagero...

357
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So, the pollen is mixed
with a sleeping potion.

358
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,560
But how long will
it hold them back?

359
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,560
Why, you...!

360
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,280
Girl!

361
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You have to hold them off
till Jubei kills him!

362
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,920
Do whatever it takes!

363
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,880
Call off your wasps!

364
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,480
I'm afraid you
must beat me first.

365
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You don't know
anything, do you?

366
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,760
Do you think I ran
in here to escape you?

367
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,560
No, I don't.

368
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I have lots of questions for you,
but no time to ask them.

369
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,160
No, just one thing.
Tell me, is Himuro Gemma alive?

370
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,760
So what if he is?

371
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Because I sent him
to hell before.

372
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,760
Is that so?
Then I'lI have to be careful.

373
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,640
Unlike Gemma, I don't have
the technique to reincarnate myself.

374
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,640
Reincarnation?

375
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,320
Fool! You've
damaged the hive!

376
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,240
The second you come up for air
is the second you die!

377
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,520
He's mine!
Keep your hands off him!

378
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
What about the ninja girl
and the monk?

379
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,600
My wasps should
finish them off soon.

380
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
How far is he trying to run?
What a poor loser!

381
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,600
Desperately stinging his body
as they do so... Mushizo's lost.

382
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,120
Took his time about it,
but he finally killed him.

383
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,080
Reincarnation? Did he mean
Himuro Gemma's come back to life?

384
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,520
Impossible!

385
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,960
Reincarnation?
I've heard about the technique.

386
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,680
You must control your flesh and blood
down to the tiniest bones.

387
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
If your limbs or even
your head were cut off...

388
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,400
you'd be able
to rejoin them.

389
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Reincarnation...
That's a technique of immortality.

390
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It can never be achieved
by a human being.

391
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,640
It's terrible,
but it seems Gemma can.

392
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,080
Anyway, the Kimon monsters
are now all after you.

393
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,240
That means I can move easily.

394
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,480
If you're lucky,
we'll meet again.

395
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,400
- Right.
- Why did you join him?

396
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,520
He hired me...
For 100 gold pieces.

397
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,440
You're a mercenary ninja?
One who'd do anything for money?

398
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,840
You could say that.

399
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,680
But he suckered me into it.
Trapped me.

400
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,600
I'll die of his poison
in haIf a day.

401
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
He promised me an antidote
along with the gold.

402
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,040
That's why I work for him.
l can't back out now.

403
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,320
You'd better run for it
while I divert their attention.

404
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,800
I can't do that.
I'd owe you another debt.

405
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Forget about any debts.

406
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And I told you I don't
have to take orders from you.

407
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,600
Besides, I'm ready
to die any moment.

408
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You don't have to convince me
you're tough.

409
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,200
Oh?

410
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It's this humid weather!

411
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,600
I wish a storm would come
and cool off that hot head of yours.

412
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,720
You're in no position
to worry about me.

413
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I remember...

414
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,840
They came on the night
of that big storm...

415
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,960
Hey, where can I get
a good look at this area?

416
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
How about there?

417
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,400
Nothing.

418
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,600
Keep looking!

419
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Hanza...

420
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,280
Wait!

421
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,320
Hanza!

422
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,640
There's a cliff
in front of you! Stop!

423
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,400
Damn...!

424
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Gotcha!

425
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,440
Look out!

426
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,280
Fools! They got you so soon?
We stilI had a lot to do.

427
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
The scent of blasted flesh,
grilled to perfection...

428
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,880
Such a lovely smell.

429
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,680
Don't...move...

430
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
That's enough. Let me go.

431
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,560
It's my fault I fell
for their trap.

432
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,880
Shut up! Don't talk!

433
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,600
Let go of me!
l don't want your help.

434
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,640
Grab the line!

435
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,360
Just gonna hang onto me all day?

436
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,360
I am Utsutsu Mujuro.
I've been longing to challenge you.

437
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,240
He's here for me.
Stay here.

438
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,320
You lured me here because I'm blind?
ls that your plan?

439
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,040
If you want to kill me,
then don't make a sound.

440
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,840
The only sound you'll hear is the sound
of your own voice screaming.

441
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,040
I told you to stay back!

442
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,200
Your sight is your weakness.

443
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,640
Outta the way!

444
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,600
Impossible...

445
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,520
Would you give it a rest?!
What the hell were you thinking?!

446
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,720
Why have you become
so desperate to die?

447
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,720
Shut up! You're the one obsessed
with repaying me for saving you!

448
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,040
You act like you've got
some kind of death wish!

449
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,160
Is it because of your body?

450
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,280
Is it true the men you sleep
with die from the poison?

451
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,360
Embrace me
and you'll find out.

452
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Idiot!

453
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,440
My body is saturated
with poison.

454
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,480
It's so strong that a touch of my lips
will kill instantly.

455
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,040
No one can touch me.
Anyone who dares to...dies.

456
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,600
Did the poison twist
your heart, too?

457
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,600
How dare you!

458
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,960
I hate people who don't
value their own lives.

459
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,800
You've no idea...
You couldn't understand!

460
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
The cargo from the ship that ran aground
in the storm two days ago.

461
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
That's what they're after.

462
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,080
They butchered the villagers
like animals for it.

463
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,120
Where does this road lead?

464
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,560
Chamberlain!

465
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Lord Hyobu, is it true?
That the Koga ninja who...

466
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,280
went to investigate
Shimoda Village were wiped out?

467
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,400
Exactly.

468
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,480
But how...?!
This is an emergency.

469
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I'll take my men
to the village immediately.

470
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
No!

471
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,800
If this is serious
enough to jeopardize...

472
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
the safety of our clan,
we must move very carefully.

473
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
That's how small clans
like ours can survive.

474
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
But...

475
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,560
The ninja woman who survived
is continuing the investigation.

476
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,880
Wait for her report.

477
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You're tired from being
tensed up all the time.

478
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,880
Get some more sleep.

479
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,800
Those wheel tracks lead
to Kashima Harbor.

480
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
They're probably going to
transport the cargo out by boat.

481
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
If I don't stop them...

482
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,600
the dead villagers and Koga
ninja will never rest in peace.

483
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,040
I'll cooperate with you
till the mission's over.

484
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,440
But if you insult me again,
I'll kill you where you stand!

485
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,280
Listen well, you who labor
for the Shogun of the Dark.

486
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,920
This mission could very
well decide our fate!

487
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
This ship will reach
the Mochizuki domain in a few hours.

488
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,680
We must retrieve
the cargo at any cost!

489
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,040
Understood? At any cost!

490
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
The townspeople must have cleared out
out fear of the epidemic.

491
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,080
One dead horse was enough
to scare them all away.

492
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,800
So, you're still alive.
I've been worried.

493
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's nice to see you, too.

494
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,120
They're waiting for a boat
to transport the cargo.

495
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Did you check
what the cargo is?

496
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,200
No, I couldn't reach it.
But I can guess what it is.

497
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Actually, I guessed before
l came here to Mochizuki.

498
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
What is it?!

499
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
You haven't figured it out?

500
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,920
It's something that has
to do with your past.

501
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,600
It's gold, boy. Gold produced
from that secret Yamashiro mine.

502
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
The ship ran aground
during the storm...

503
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,800
Probably on its way to the Shogun
of the Dark with caskets of gold.

504
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,400
Gold that's probably been
hidden for the last five years.

505
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
If it reaches his hands,
he'll be powerful enough...

506
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,680
to topple
the Tokugawa government...

507
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and plunge the country
into another civil war.

508
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,360
We have to stop it
at any cost!

509
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Dakuan, someone's followed you.

510
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,320
What?!

511
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,120
Girl, what are you doing?!

512
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,240
I'm calling a Koga ninja bird
that's in this village.

513
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Calling a bird? What for?

514
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It'll carry my message
to the castle chamberlain.

515
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I've discovered
what they're after.

516
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,960
In two hours, his army
will surround the town.

517
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It's not as easy
as you think.

518
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
The Mochizuki clan will probably
pretend they didn't know.

519
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,280
Why?!

520
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
The future of the clan
is at stake.

521
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
This is a power struggle between
the Tokugawa and the Shogun of the Dark.

522
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,840
If a small clan like the Mochizuki
got involved, it will be smashed!

523
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,640
See nothing, hear nothing.
That's the best course for the clan.

524
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,480
We'll find out soon whether
or not the Mochizuki will move.

525
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So, now what are
you playing at?

526
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,160
The man you hired is going
to die from your poison.

527
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Tell me how to save him.

528
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,320
Amazing! You've fallen in love
with Jubei, haven't you?

529
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,120
Fool! I'm only doing it
to clear my debt with him!

530
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,760
I don't think so.

531
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,320
Imagine a ninja woman
who believes she falling in love!

532
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,800
If you kill me,
there'll be no saving him.

533
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,680
Yes, that's true, but your mission
won't be accomplished either.

534
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,400
Damn it!

535
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,720
Calm down!
That's the real cure for him.

536
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
If you want to save his life,
there's no other way.

537
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,680
It's up to you.

538
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,440
Oh, no...

539
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,160
It must have happened
when I went off for a moment.

540
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
She's most likely dead.

541
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,160
Well, we've got work to do.

542
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,800
We'll get no help
from the Mochizuki clan.

543
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Don't fall for their trap.

544
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,280
Wait!

545
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,880
What if their ship comes
while you're at it?

546
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,280
Let her alone! A dead ninja
girl isn't that important!

547
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Not important compared
to the great mission?

548
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
You're as terrible as they are!

549
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Fool!
When you fight monsters...

550
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,880
you become one yourself
or you can't win.

551
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,720
You damn fool boy!
Go ahead! GO TO HELL!

552
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,800
Are you all right?

553
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,360
Kagero!

554
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,200
You're hard to kill.
Woman, relieve him of his pain.

555
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,400
Ninja...

556
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,760
Yurimaru, report.

557
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,680
Lord Gemma,
all three have been killed.

558
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Idiot! They still live.

559
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I'll kill them myself!

560
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,120
Stay where you are.
Lure them there and kill them.

561
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Understand?

562
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,240
Yes.

563
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,880
Never would I have
imagined to see him here.

564
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,800
I look forward to
seeing you again, Jubei.

565
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,320
Gemma!

566
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,480
I'm sorry.

567
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,800
Forget it. I take it the castle
retainers haven't taken any action?

568
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,880
It's been two hours.

569
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,320
I see.

570
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,040
You knew it was a trap,
yet you came to help me.

571
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,760
It was stupid.
Why risk your life for me?

572
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Because you're my comrade.

573
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,400
Comrade?

574
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,440
Yes. We've saved each other
over and over since yesterday.

575
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,800
You're my comrade.

576
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Stay!

577
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,840
The Mochizuki clan
is sitting this one out.

578
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,920
Your mission is over.

579
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,680
No, it isn't.
I'm still in debt to you.

580
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,120
You can pay it back later.

581
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,840
Not if you're dead!

582
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,840
I'll repay it here!

583
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,840
What are you doing?

584
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,080
The old man told me how
to counteract the poison.

585
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
"Kill poison with poison".

586
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,040
He said if you make love
to me, you'll be cured.

587
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,480
Take me...

588
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,320
Why?!
You'll die if you don't!

589
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,640
Why...? JUBEl!

590
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,960
We've been waiting!
Load the ship immediately!

591
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,480
You! Well,
l warned you, didn't l?

592
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,960
We're screwed.
We'll never beat that many men.

593
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,400
I don't intend to let them go.
We'll make our stand soon.

594
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
What are you planning?

595
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,120
When they finish loading
the gold onto the ship...

596
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
go to the tower
and ring the bell.

597
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
While they're distracted,
I'll sneak onboard the ship.

598
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
When we're out at sea,
we won't need any storm.

599
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,880
I'll sink it myself.

600
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,480
Very well.

601
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,040
By the way, did you make love
to the ninja girl?

602
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,800
None of your damn business!
Now get going!

603
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,560
Gemma... Where are you?

604
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,800
When I die, I'll take you
to hell with me!

605
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,240
Huh?

606
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,760
The Mochizuki clan
made a move after all!

607
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Ah, Kagero!
You've done a fine job.

608
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,120
Hurry, before they get away!
Where are the others?

609
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,920
Don't worry. We've got
this place surrounded.

610
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,520
Then hurry!

611
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,400
Jubei...

612
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,360
Kagero!

613
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,800
Stop! It's a trap!

614
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,640
Fools! Sakaki Hyobu
died two days ago.

615
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I killed him personally.

616
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,400
GEMMA!!!

617
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,720
Sir, please get
aboard the ship quickly.

618
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,200
The retainers of the
Shogun of the Dark are waiting.

619
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,120
Leave Jubei to me.
Upon my honor, I will not fail.

620
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,320
Please grant me
this one wish.

621
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,840
Very well then. Go.

622
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Go away.
You're a failure.

623
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,920
Don't hang around me anymore.
You disgust me!

624
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,800
So, you are Gemma?

625
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,880
The Mochizuki clan
suspect nothing, correct?

626
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,760
Yes. All is well.

627
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,400
You've done a splendid job.
l admire you Devils of Kimon.

628
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,680
The Shogun of the Dark
will be pleased.

629
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,280
Do you feel the agony,
Jubei?

630
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Yurimaru seems to have
suffered some ill fortune!

631
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,040
How careless of him
to have fallen into my trap.

632
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,400
Now he's the Queen of the Devils!

633
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,440
Let's go.

634
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,360
Kagero!

635
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,800
Don't die! Kagero!

636
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,400
Jubei...

637
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I told you not to come.

638
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,560
I owed you a favor.
Remember, Jubei?

639
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,040
It was the first time...

640
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
anyone ever treated me
as a woman...

641
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,400
and not as a ninja warrior
who was completely expendable.

642
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,840
I knew I would become more attracted
to you if we stayed together...

643
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
but I needed that from you.
Please, forgive me.

644
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,480
I'm sorry.

645
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,600
You were the only person
who didn't care about my poison soul!

646
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,240
Whether for an antidote...
or just from compassion...

647
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,760
I wish we could have
made love just once.

648
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,280
I was not honest.
l was weak.

649
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,760
I...needed...you!

650
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
No!
It's not over yet!

651
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,400
Jubei...
I'm glad...l met you...

652
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,520
Gemma, with the gold's help,
our dream will soon be reality.

653
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
"Our" dream?

654
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,800
Our great dream
to topple the Shogunate...

655
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
and restore the reign
of the House of Toyotomi.

656
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
You don't understand...

657
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
how we, the former retainers
of Toyotomi, have suffered.

658
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,480
Now it'll be the Tokugawa who
suffer the agony and torment.

659
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
We'll use the gold to buy
the most advanced weapons from Spain...

660
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,640
and defeat
the Tokugawa government.

661
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,800
That is the dream of all of us
who work for the Shogun of the Dark.

662
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,440
Nonsense.

663
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,800
What did you say?!

664
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I said nonsense.

665
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,640
Hold your tongue!
You're a mere ninja!

666
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,960
My dream is different.

667
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
The gold isn't going
to the Shogun of the Dark.

668
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
What?!

669
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
We, the Devils of Kimon,
will take the gold.

670
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,720
You impudent...!

671
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,560
I'll use it to organize
the most powerful army of ninja ever.

672
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,760
And we'll rule the country
with terror and power from the shadows.

673
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,960
Anyone who opposes me,
Tokugawa or Toyotomi...

674
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,120
even the Shogun of the Dark
himself, shall die.

675
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,120
Meaning the true
Shogun of the Dark... will be me.

676
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,280
Well, now, you're here!
l was just wishing you'd come.

677
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I'm glad to hear that.

678
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,480
Of course.

679
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,120
Without your help,
sinking a big ship like this...

680
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
would be impossible!

681
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,720
Ruin your plans?

682
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,520
Not at all.

683
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,600
What's wrong?

684
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,520
Fire in the hold!
We're gonna sink!

685
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Idiot!
Put out the fire!

686
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Impossible!
It's a sea of flame!

687
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,920
Put it out! Fight it!

688
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,760
Move it! Move it!

689
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,680
Forget it! Run!

690
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Master Gemma!

691
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Pass this message to everyone:

692
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,640
"Abandon ship and hide yourselves
I'll call for you someday".

693
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,760
- Now go!
- Sir!

694
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,880
Jump for your lives!

695
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,320
Gemma!

696
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,480
Did you miss the flames of hell?
ls that why you came here?

697
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Kibagami Jubei...

698
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,840
I should've finished you
with my own hands.

699
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,440
Stop your whining.
It's too late.

700
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,760
You want to avenge
the ninja girl Kagero?

701
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,680
She's nothing compared to what
I'm going to lose with this ship.

702
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,440
Prepare to lose your life as well.

703
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,160
I won't kill you yet.
Not before I make you suffer.

704
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I'll make you pay
for smashing my dream.

705
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,760
Your dream? That you were going to be
the true Shogun of the Dark?

706
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,880
Don't make me laugh.

707
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,360
If you became shogun,
you'd make this a world of devils.

708
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,600
If you enjoy
their company so much...

709
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,040
then go back to hell!

710
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,760
I'll kill you...!

711
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,840
No one can kill me.

712
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,680
You of all people
should know by now...

713
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,640
I am immortal.

714
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,520
Is that so?

715
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,480
If you keep coming
back to life...

716
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,040
then I'll kill you
as many times as it takes!

717
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,560
I can't die!

718
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,360
GEMMA! BURN lN YOUR GOLDEN HELL!

719
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,320
Jubei!

720
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,160
You seem to be rid
of the poison, thanks to Kagero.

721
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
The combination of
a poison-tasting ninja girl and...

722
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,760
a talented lone woIf worked out
even better than I had planned.

723
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,400
Go away.

724
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,560
By the way, I'm sorry
about losing Kagero. A real pity, that!

725
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
But for a scant few moments,
she was able to...

726
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,960
be an ordinary girl
and make love with you.

727
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,400
Was that part
of your plan, too?

728
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Exactly. To read and control
people's hearts...

729
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,520
is the true secret
of the ninja.

730
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,200
Still, only true sincerity
can move the human heart.

731
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,920
A twisted old bastard
like me couldn't do it.

732
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,880
You're a hell of a guy.
l really admire you.

733
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
As promised, I'll be waiting in Edo
with your 100 gold pieces.

734
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,680
Come and get it,
if you're still alive.

735
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
That makes us even.
Now never cross my path again.

736
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,600
You've beaten me. I thought I'd
shut your mouth in Edo, but...

737
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,840
still, in your condition you likely
won't even make it to the shore.

738
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,640
Everything will end
just as I planned.

739
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,840
Come with me, let's go out
to see the stars

740
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,200
Evening has only
just begun

741
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,480
I don't want anything
Only for you

742
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,600
To be at my side
A smile on your face

743
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,560
A distant summer
The two of us alone

744
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,560
Sitting on the beach
we used to walk

745
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,440
Trying to retrieve
the gentleness

746
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,840
That we left behind

747
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,640
A distant ballad sung
to no one at all

748
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,240
I can still
hear it even now

749
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,320
It embraces
my wandering heart

750
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,280
Just like
the cool night wind

751
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,040
Looking at you
Only you

752
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,400
Saying things
hard for us to say

753
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,440
Times may have changed
But I know

754
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,640
My feelings are
still the same for you

755
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,640
A distant ballad sung
to no one at all

756
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,240
I can still
hear it even now

757
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,320
It embraces
my wandering heart

758
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,280
Just like
the cool night wind
