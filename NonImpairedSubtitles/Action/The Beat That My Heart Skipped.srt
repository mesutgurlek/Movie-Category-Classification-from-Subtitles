1
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,757
You knew my dad, right?

2
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:29,293
He wasn't senile.
More of a bossy go-getter.

3
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,790
Then he started to bug me, bigtime.

4
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:36,694
He bugged me as a whole,
but this was new.

5
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:41,430
Before, he'd only pretend to consult me.
He'd say 'Do this'

6
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:42,939
and I'd do it.

7
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,101
Now he starts asking
my advice on everything,

8
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,042
what I'd do if I were him...

9
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,878
even what I think of him
balling his female staff!

10
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,542
I hated it. It grossed me out.

11
00:00:55,855 --> 00:01:00,314
He went on like we were buddies.
It drove me nuts!

12
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,063
Then it clicked.
This wasn't my dad, here.

13
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,830
He'd become like a kid
that I was responsible for.

14
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:15,634
Like I was the dad, see?

15
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,771
See what happens?

16
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:25,543
You wake up one morning
and things have switched places.

17
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,813
Gimme a light.

18
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,022
The bitch of it is, you're helpless.

19
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,823
You can scream and kick
the walls, it's no goddamn use.

20
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,232
Time's moved on,
your dad's an old man,

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,334
you're not immortal anymore.

22
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,334
Do you believe in God?

23
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,031
Times like that
make you start to believe.

24
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,409
Finally, you learn to put up with it.

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,250
Then my dad fell sick and I...

26
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,013
I nursed him like a baby.

27
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:06,516
Wiped his ass, fed him,
cleaned his mouth...

28
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,132
The worst thing was,
I didn't want it to stop.

29
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,532
The year after that,
I had my first kid.

30
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,485
THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED

31
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,150
I don't see why.

32
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,094
I really don't see why.

33
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,823
I told you about a house
on Rue Carrel.

34
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:22,297
On the east side.
You didn't mention the west side.

35
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,934
Whichever side,
you knew it was my patch!

36
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,767
Why not the whole region?

37
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,466
You pulled a fast one on me,
admit it.

38
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,671
Can't you kill the sound
and your cigar?

39
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,644
- How much d'you want?
- Dunno.

40
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:37,942
Don't know?

41
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,078
50-50?

42
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:44,017
50-50? I set up the deal
and you take half for nothing?

43
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,314
Hot stuff!

44
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,959
Hang on!
I can bring know-how and cash.

45
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,053
Sure! Take a lot of know-how
to make me swallow that.

46
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,400
What's your offer?

47
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,566
Nothing. Nada!

48
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:00,500
You're the one sweating it.
I don't need you.

49
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:02,701
That's a new one!

50
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:03,933
Hear that, Sami?

51
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,010
I don't give a shit.
Do your business.

52
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,444
Do your deal
and stop crapping about it.

53
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,715
I'll give you 'I don't need you.'

54
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,551
In the last six months...
Who found the warehouses?

55
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,021
Without me, you'd still be
haggling with that old bag.

56
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,987
- And the tennis courts...
- Tennis courts?

57
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,191
The acre along the highway.

58
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,995
If you don't remember that,
what you need is a doctor!

59
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,174
So what's your offer?

60
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,368
I told you, 50-50.

61
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,970
OK, plus half of the Belgrand deal.

62
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,082
Like fuck!
Belgrand's worth four times Massy!

63
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,740
Don't give me that!

64
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,048
If Massy's worth shit,
why make such a big deal of it?

65
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,649
- This it?
- On the left.

66
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,099
Cut it out!

67
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,942
You go that way.

68
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,210
Two floors up.

69
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,619
I can't see!
Gimme a flashlight. You have a spare.

70
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,298
What's going on up there?

71
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,664
Search me. A rat must've bit him.

72
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,507
The asshole scared me!

73
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,673
- What's up, Sami?
- It ran up my leg and bit me!

74
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,250
Where? Let me see.

75
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,853
- Fuckin' bit me all over!
- I can't see.

76
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,250
- What do you want?
- My smokes.

77
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,556
OK, fuck you.

78
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,691
Fuck you!

79
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,663
I've thought it over. It's a deal.

80
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,405
- What's a deal?
- What we said.

81
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,704
Massy and the Belgrand place, 50-50.

82
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,613
- When's the due date?
- 22nd.

83
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,414
- How much under the table?
- 500,000.

84
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,350
250,000 each. OK with you?

85
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,287
One thing I don't get about Beefy.

86
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,090
If he hates rats,
why does he plant them?

87
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,994
- Why not plant something else?
- What, snakes?

88
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,531
Or his mother?

89
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,335
- Feeling better?
- And you?

90
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,126
Go away!

91
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,806
When will you be done?

92
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,307
This part tonight.
The rest in two days, minimum.

93
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,909
Thursday?

94
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,974
I'm signing the deal at 11 AM.
Get me the plans by 8.

95
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,310
- I can't.
- Course you can!

96
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,647
What's the rush?
We can beat him down.

97
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,726
He owes Martens 60,000.
I'll tell Martens to collect.

98
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:50,192
Why would he?

99
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:53,059
I know him. He owes me one.

100
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:56,657
If he finds out,
we'll find ourselves buying from him.

101
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:58,861
Don't be paranoid. He won't know.

102
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:06,570
You handle Martens,
I'll fix the lawyer and City Hall.

103
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,820
You can't go in there!
You're trespassing!

104
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,692
They broke the lock!

105
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,295
You're trespassing on private property!

106
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,728
Where are you going? Get out!

107
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,367
- What's your problem?
- I own this place!

108
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,297
Clear out.

109
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,564
- You're crazy!
- No, I'm the owner.

110
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,102
- No entry!
- I live here.

111
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,005
No! No, you don't.

112
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,144
Where were you?

113
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,939
Stuck in traffic. I came quick...

114
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:45,015
Can't you ever do what you say?

115
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,378
I was stuck in traffic!

116
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,612
Bullshit! The watchman says
you never came here once.

117
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,821
And now look!

118
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,148
Get this zoo out of here!

119
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:56,358
- Who are you?
- Leave them alone.

120
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,290
Who are you?

121
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,624
Housing Rights group.
You the owners?

122
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:00,925
Guess!

123
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,261
This is illegal.

124
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,928
The law's on our side.

125
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,128
They've been here 48 hours.

126
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,604
There's water, power.
It's their home now.

127
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,572
You want your building back,

128
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,574
find a place to rehouse them.

129
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,178
We can get the cops.

130
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,942
The cops are right there. Go get them!

131
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,518
They're not squatters, they're families.
That's the point.

132
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,350
They've only occupied the street side,
not the back yet.

133
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:31,087
Get Lesrec and his guys here quick
or we're stuck for six months.

134
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,378
How many apartments are there?

135
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,156
Won't be so easy now!

136
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,419
Halfass!

137
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,313
Hi.

138
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:02,785
Did you order?

139
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,420
I was waiting for you.

140
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,289
Boy, that looks... What is it?

141
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,787
Electro.

142
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,023
Try it?

143
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,871
You dig this for real?

144
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,602
Seriously?

145
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,875
I listen to it!

146
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,953
What's this shit called again?

147
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,954
Why are you jumpy? Balls itch?

148
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:47,496
You wanted to talk.

149
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:52,828
What if I got married again?

150
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:57,640
Do I know her?

151
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,841
Not yet. I asked her
to come meet you.

152
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,142
Wait till you see her.
A beaut!

153
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,216
She's got tits...

154
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,447
legs up to her chin...
and an ass!

155
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,557
That should do.

156
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,158
Am I making you awkward?

157
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,223
Do you have to marry her?

158
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,725
Have to?

159
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,425
No, why?

160
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,496
She's not pregnant.

161
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,875
That's not what I meant.

162
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,674
Tell me straight.
You say no, I won't.

163
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,679
Do it, Dad.
If that's what you want.

164
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,543
If it makes you happy, do it.

165
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,412
Sure! Do it.

166
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,818
One other thing.

167
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:47,049
There's a couscous joint
owes me six months' rent.

168
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,091
Every time I ask for it, he whines,

169
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,253
'My wife's pregnant,
my daughter's getting married,' etc.

170
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:56,231
Guess what? The rat's buying
tax-deductible real estate!

171
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:01,168
He's fleecing me
and lining his nest with it!

172
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,638
Can you fix him?

173
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,910
- It won't take you a minute.
- I said OK.

174
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,649
I wrote it all down here.

175
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,889
Here comes Gorgeous!

176
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,752
My son Thomas, Chris.

177
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:30,332
I have a call to make.
Sit there, I won't be long.

178
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,868
- Want a drink?
- A kir.

179
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,802
- You?
- I'm fine.

180
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,747
So you're Robert's son?

181
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,549
What do you do?

182
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,424
I model, for catalogs.

183
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:00,231
And commercials, if I can.
I auditioned for one this morning.

184
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,201
Competition must be stiff.

185
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,363
All those East European girls.

186
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,664
Why East European?

187
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,503
It's just the way I heard it.

188
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,845
You're in real estate, like Robert?

189
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,052
- How's business?
- OK.

190
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,923
So what's Chris short for?

191
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,230
Yvonne?

192
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,226
No, Christine.

193
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,936
Are you getting at me?
Did I offend you?

194
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,230
Why are you getting at me?

195
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:43,806
Just kidding.
Are you serious about Robert?

196
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,734
I think so.

197
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,141
We haven't known each other long.

198
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:52,540
We go out and have fun.
He makes me laugh.

199
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,680
Introduces me to people.

200
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,451
I love my dad.

201
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:04,952
I don't want him taken for a ride
and have to pick up the pieces.

202
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,754
Did you order?

203
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,055
I can't stay.

204
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,138
Order, I'll be back.

205
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,869
Why are you leaving?

206
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,046
I forgot an appointment.

207
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,580
How do you like her?

208
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,150
You're the one marrying her.

209
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,288
I know, but what do you think?

210
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,547
Nothing.

211
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,281
What's that mean?

212
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,315
She's a whore, Dad.

213
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,462
Why? Because she
models and stuff?

214
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:39,085
Because she's a whore!

215
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,822
You asked me, I answered.

216
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:43,594
Hey, forget it.

217
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,832
Forget it. Sorry I spoke.

218
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,541
Mr. Fox!

219
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,487
Could you ask that gentleman...

220
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,964
Don't you recognize me?
Thomas Seyr.

221
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,494
Sonia's son?

222
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:25,266
Tom, right?

223
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,271
- How old are you now?
- 28.

224
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,232
You're here for the concert?

225
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,372
- Did you hear him play at Pleyel?
- I missed it.

226
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,743
You'll see he's very good.
I'm his manager.

227
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,048
Have you kept it up?

228
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,308
Music?

229
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,581
Do you still play the piano?

230
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,486
Yes... and no.

231
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,884
It got complicated after Mom died.

232
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,794
That's a shame.
You had talent.

233
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,832
I remember you
played something for me.

234
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,594
A Haydn sonata, number 32.

235
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,666
It's starting.

236
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:02,772
I'll be off.

237
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,205
Here's my card.

238
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,572
Come play piano for me.

239
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,006
Come for an audition.

240
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,081
Call my assistant and set a date.

241
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,645
Don't let me down.

242
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,588
I can't focus.

243
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,720
Try again?

244
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,470
I'm too...
My heart's beating too hard.

245
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,313
No good!

246
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,048
I'm too nervous. I can't do it.

247
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,370
- It's not perfect.
- Very close.

248
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,864
Close but not quite!

249
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,004
It looks easy but...

250
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,413
It's very clean.

251
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,316
But the emotion is not very generous.

252
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,277
Can I help you?

253
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:12,017
- You last played when?
- About ten years ago.

254
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,590
Ten years without practice?

255
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,216
I practice.
I never gave up completely.

256
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:20,593
I play for myself,
when I'm in the mood, or for friends.

257
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,060
And now you're auditioning?

258
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,896
That's right.

259
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:27,436
You're too old for the conservatory.

260
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,502
For a competition?

261
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,642
For an agent. A manager.

262
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,834
Manager?

263
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,409
So he'll take me on.

264
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:36,341
I'm confused.

265
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:38,608
You're not a professional pianist?

266
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,682
So why a manager?

267
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,489
He offered to audition me.

268
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:50,059
My mother was a concert pianist...
He managed her concerts.

269
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:54,096
I grew up with music.
There was always a piano at home...

270
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:56,797
I know about it.

271
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,303
If I'm good,
I think he'll take me on.

272
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,234
As what? A pianist?

273
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,471
A concert pianist?

274
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,712
May I ask what you do?

275
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,716
I work.

276
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,184
In what field?

277
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,687
I work in real estate.

278
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,256
I'm a broker, see?

279
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:25,255
I plant rats in buildings,
cut off the water and power.

280
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,332
Sometimes me and my pals
go in with baseball bats

281
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,470
and force people out of their homes.

282
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,228
What exactly do you want?

283
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,375
Play me something, go on.

284
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,337
- What are you doing?
- Fuck you, prick!

285
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,003
What's the big idea?

286
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,542
It's an agency downtown.

287
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,779
Call Madame Bouffera.
I spoke with her.

288
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:55,957
06-22-68-90-12

289
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,890
I told you about it. I'm not wacko.

290
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,195
Tell her I sent you and call me back.

291
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,973
What do you want?

292
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:15,237
I heard you talking to our teacher.

293
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,114
You want piano lessons?

294
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,147
Just someone to judge my playing.

295
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,448
I have a friend, a pianist.

296
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,520
Her name is Miao Lin.
She just arrived in Paris.

297
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,419
She studied at the Beijing Conservatory

298
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,719
and won a two-year scholarship.

299
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,859
She has given lessons and concerts.

300
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,030
Are you interested?

301
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:38,703
Depends.

302
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,738
If so, call this number
and ask for Jean-Pierre.

303
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,537
- Who's Jean-Pierre?
- Me.

304
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,453
What's this rathole?

305
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,150
I've got business nearby.

306
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,455
How's it going?

307
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,496
A strange thing happened.

308
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,899
Remember Mr. Fox?
He managed Mom's concerts.

309
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,265
Tall, faggoty jerk?

310
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,872
I ran into him, we talked.
Guess what?

311
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,968
He asked me for an audition.

312
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:22,235
Audition? You?

313
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,746
Why not me?

314
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,244
Think I'm not up to it?

315
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,316
Audition for what?

316
00:26:30,354 --> 00:26:32,915
I don't know yet. Depends.

317
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:34,957
Depends on what?

318
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,292
Look how your mom ended up.

319
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,892
Don't talk about her that way.

320
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,657
What way do you want?

321
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,793
Your Fox is a pimp.

322
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,935
He didn't deal
with her fits like I did.

323
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,836
At the end, you didn't even see her.
It was me she talked to.

324
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,271
Don't give me that shit.

325
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,713
What's it to be?

326
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,373
Same as him.

327
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,919
Remember that favor I asked you?

328
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,685
What favor?

329
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,628
The couscous jerk
who owes me six months rent.

330
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:12,821
Sorry, no time.

331
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,222
No time?

332
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:19,632
Time to see that fag
and get psyched up about pianos,

333
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,771
but not 20 minutes for me.

334
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:25,041
Don't get anal about it. I forgot.

335
00:27:25,242 --> 00:27:26,903
I'll see him, end of story.

336
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,307
That's handy. He's across the street.

337
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,651
I don't believe it!
How can you pull this on me?

338
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,655
You said you'd do it, do it.

339
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,794
Is this payback time or what?

340
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,322
Will you do it or not?

341
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,227
No way! Not like this.

342
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,731
Fix your own shit.

343
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,227
Right.

344
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:15,956
Asshole.

345
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,961
Beat it!

346
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,512
Mounir! The kitchen's on fire!

347
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,377
Quick! There's a fire!

348
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:29,555
Freeze!

349
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:32,759
My dad's money!

350
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,438
Touch my dad again, I'll kill you.

351
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,565
Here.

352
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,264
Not so hard, was it?

353
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:10,701
Do me a favor.
Forget me for a while.

354
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,403
Is that how you want it?

355
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,540
How else do you want it?

356
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,881
Dammit, Dad!

357
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,029
My friend, Miao Lin.

358
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,499
What is your name?

359
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,384
What do you need exactly?

360
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:03,042
For an audition,
to know where I stand.

361
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,025
Hold it. Doesn't
she speak French?

362
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,058
She only just got here.

363
00:32:12,696 --> 00:32:13,890
Only Chinese?

364
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:17,295
Chinese, Viet, and a little English.

365
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,134
Does it matter, no French?

366
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,909
No smoking, no talking?
Pain in the...

367
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:32,044
We will work it out, don't worry.

368
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,946
She can coach you real well.

369
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,947
She has coached musicians
for competitions.

370
00:32:39,423 --> 00:32:40,823
She is very good.

371
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,488
Do you need some tea?

372
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,229
What about timing and money?

373
00:32:54,372 --> 00:33:00,436
Mornings she has classes,
otherwise she's free.

374
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,545
Every day at 2 PM, OK?

375
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,592
That one looks good.

376
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,558
It's pushing it, sizewise.

377
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:22,223
Over 350 square meters,
City Hall may poke its nose in.

378
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,236
You're trading business
premises for housing...

379
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,136
Can you show me
Montmorency Villas again?

380
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,469
Same problem.

381
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,166
I have an architect friend...

382
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,411
I'm Thomas Seyr.
Mr. Fox asked me to call.

383
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,352
He told you?

384
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,855
An audition, yes.

385
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,785
Date?

386
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,287
I don't know.

387
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,061
What's available?

388
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,126
I'll hold.

389
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,863
We've made a shortlist.

390
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,564
I forgot something.

391
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,468
Seyr again. We got cut off.
Go on, I'm listening.

392
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,011
The 23rd? 11 o'clock?

393
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,608
Suits me fine.

394
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,150
Where? What's the address?

395
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,431
Are you busy tonight?

396
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:02,621
Why?

397
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,826
I told Aline we're having dinner.

398
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:05,834
Again?

399
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,133
She'll believe it if she sees you.
Pick me up from home.

400
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,933
I cross town so you get laid?

401
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,076
Attaboy!

402
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,335
- Who is she?
- Who cares?

403
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,979
Tell me or I won't come.

404
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:17,875
The realty chick from uptown.

405
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:20,074
- Same as before?
- The other one.

406
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:22,850
- I won't do it.
- Asshole!

407
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,163
- You've come for him?
- We're running late.

408
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,163
Dinner with a client?

409
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,268
- How've you been?
- OK.

410
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,425
Will you be out late?

411
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,169
Not very.

412
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,739
- Does he know I'm here?
- He's on the phone.

413
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,437
- Fabrice! Tom's here.
- Coming!

414
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,682
Night, honey.

415
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,148
I won't be late.

416
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,357
Bye.

417
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,554
She suspects something.

418
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,292
She doesn't suspect, in fact...

419
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:11,901
she's happy I'm with you.

420
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,695
Next time, know what?

421
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,032
We change tactics. You drive me home.

422
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,671
To save me from driving home drunk.
Dig it?

423
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,177
Is that all?

424
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,545
You smug, skirt-chasing smartass!

425
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,812
Don't you have any class?

426
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,946
Don't forget the bank tomorrow.

427
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,150
The loan for the Massy place.
You want half, do half the work.

428
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,056
- What time?
- 11.

429
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:47,366
Horowitz was the magician
who revealed all the piano's magic...

430
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,573
and especially its sparkle.

431
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,908
He had the most
marvelous pianist's hands...

432
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:03,742
like a delicately muscled racehorse.

433
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,285
I can't do it.

434
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,690
Having somebody
behind me puts me off.

435
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:49,299
I can't take it. It won't work.
I'm not used to it.

436
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,467
Come over here. Stand here.

437
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:56,939
Look that way.

438
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,427
Two Jacks on the rocks.

439
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,331
Guess what? Verodin told me
he wants to build on the east side.

440
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,072
He's tight with the Illouz
brothers, so I kept quiet.

441
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,505
But he came on strong,
'I want to work with you guys.'

442
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,779
I told him about
the Bussy flour mills.

443
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:48,548
Guess what? He said he's through
with the Illouz brothers.

444
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,847
He's sick of getting shafted.

445
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,690
That's Number 172,

446
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,726
with the vacant lot.

447
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,737
The homeowner's getting divorced.
He'll need dough.

448
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,631
Stick our card in his mailbox,
he'll call us next week.

449
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:48,878
- That's not my car.
- It's mine.

450
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:52,448
If you puke, you go in the trunk.

451
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,320
Stand up!

452
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,489
Is that you?

453
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,655
Who else?

454
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,591
Everything OK?

455
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:12,960
I am.

456
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:17,732
I put him there.
You want him in the bedroom?

457
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:18,670
That's fine.

458
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:21,334
- Well, I'll...
- Wait a sec.

459
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,285
Fabrice said he may sell this place.
Is it true?

460
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,417
He didn't tell me.

461
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,358
Is business bad?

462
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,027
Not good.

463
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,125
Another drink?

464
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,692
Yeah, OK.

465
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,532
One more and I'll go.

466
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,635
Like this?

467
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,369
Yeah, I know.

468
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,076
Like this?

469
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,089
Excuse me.
I need to talk to my partner.

470
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:20,951
There's a room next door.

471
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,793
Are you trying to screw me?

472
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,427
It's not what we said.

473
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,659
It's not the same price.

474
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,800
What's my call to Martens worth?

475
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:33,533
Name a price.

476
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,198
You're a rat!

477
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,605
Stop right there!

478
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:43,406
Rats are lazy slobs
who live off other people's work!

479
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:47,414
You want to redraft the contract
and meet with your lawyer?

480
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:11,567
It's me.

481
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:01,507
Hi there!

482
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,503
Been out on the town?

483
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,705
I went to a movie.

484
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,078
Which one?
Hungry? They're closing.

485
00:48:08,684 --> 00:48:09,708
I'm OK.

486
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,482
Have a seat.

487
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,251
You've been eating?

488
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,590
What's the matter?

489
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,195
That's odd.

490
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,658
What?

491
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,326
Isn't Fabrice with you?

492
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:29,199
No, why?

493
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:33,600
We're eating later but I got hungry.

494
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,802
I skipped lunch.

495
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:37,469
We're meeting with a client uptown...

496
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,116
That's it.

497
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:48,786
How will you warn him?

498
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:52,891
Call him on your cell phone
from the john?

499
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:56,296
'She's here, help!
What do I do? '

500
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,363
How long have you been fooling me?

501
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:08,776
Fooling you? How?

502
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,472
Skip it.

503
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:15,315
How long's it been going on?

504
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,715
I dunno.

505
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,155
How can you not know?

506
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,392
Since day one, I guess.

507
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,894
Whenever he says he's going out
with you, he's getting laid?

508
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,398
Listen...

509
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,165
One girl or several?

510
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,708
Gimme a break! I don't fuckin' know.

511
00:49:40,912 --> 00:49:43,676
- You never see them?
- No, and I don't care!

512
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:48,078
- Don't care?
- I don't give a shit.

513
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,049
Why do you do it?

514
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,253
Why I do it?

515
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:54,956
You wouldn't understand.

516
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:04,094
Listen...

517
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,110
Aline, wait!

518
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,279
Stay away from me!

519
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:21,408
Wait!

520
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:23,844
Fuck off!

521
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,716
Why do I cover for him?

522
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,383
- Because I love you.
- Get lost.

523
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,957
Did you hear me? I love you!

524
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,060
That's how it is. I want you.

525
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:42,900
Did you never feel it?

526
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,870
- What?
- Something between us.

527
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,602
So it's all in my mind?

528
00:50:50,513 --> 00:50:51,878
- Yes.
- It can't be!

529
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:55,745
Whenever we meet, we're tongue-tied
and shy, like two little kids.

530
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:59,252
Is that normal?
Am I making it up?

531
00:50:59,655 --> 00:51:01,487
Honestly, am I?

532
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:06,993
Idiot.

533
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,424
You know I'm not making it up.

534
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:26,247
- So, what now?
- I don't know.

535
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:20,164
I have to go. He'll be home soon.

536
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,697
What do you care? Stay.

537
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,802
Stay.

538
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,038
I can't.

539
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,798
I'm leaving. Let's call each other.

540
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:01,195
That's good.

541
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,333
God, you're making my day.

542
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:17,046
If you're so damn good, show me.

543
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,233
I play like that?

544
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:48,541
No, come off it.

545
00:55:58,888 --> 00:55:59,854
I get it!

546
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,023
Of course!

547
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:03,088
Move over.

548
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:26,474
Faucet.

549
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,355
And this?

550
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,321
Glass.

551
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,516
Wrong. Cup.

552
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:41,524
And this?

553
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:44,692
Matches.

554
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,667
What's this?

555
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:53,032
Saucepan.

556
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,303
Bad!

557
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,797
If you couldn't make the meeting,
why didn't you call me?

558
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,661
Did you make it to the bank?

559
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,735
You got the files, didn't you?

560
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,495
For fuck's sake...

561
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,102
His secretary's gonna try and catch him.

562
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,739
Anything else you maybe forgot?

563
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,812
- All right already.
- What's all right?

564
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,981
I messed up. Nobody died.

565
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:35,049
- If we lose the permit, we're fucked.
- I realize that.

566
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,752
- So what do we do?
- You got his secretary. What can I do?

567
00:57:40,022 --> 00:57:42,457
Nothing. It's the best thing.

568
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,251
I'm sick of this. Later.

569
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,359
So what's going on? Because...

570
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,123
Nothing.

571
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:55,564
Nothing?
You don't want to tell me?

572
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:57,330
Tell you what?

573
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,973
Playing piano is making you flip?

574
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:01,771
Stop it. Now!

575
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:05,039
Nothing's making me flip.
I'm not flipping.

576
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,509
I'm having a ball. I feel fantastic!

577
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,517
Don't you see?

578
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,018
It's important. I'm serious about it.

579
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:14,145
It's wicked.

580
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,052
You gonna make dough from pianos?

581
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,954
Not pianos. The piano!

582
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,652
It's not about making money.
It's about art.

583
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:22,827
What's in it for us?

584
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,765
You coming to meetings all mellow?

585
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,530
'Hi guys, I've been playing piano.'

586
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,274
Shit, I'll take up the banjo.

587
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:36,074
- It's over your head.
- It isn't at all.

588
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,371
Do what you like to relax after hours.

589
00:58:38,547 --> 00:58:44,043
I make balsa models with my kids
and I still keep my appointments.

590
00:58:44,253 --> 00:58:48,247
But it's not about appointments.
You don't seem on the ball.

591
00:58:49,725 --> 00:58:52,058
Get on the ball, then do what you want.

592
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:55,129
Collect Panini figures, baseball cards,

593
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,460
do your piano, nobody cares.

594
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,126
Did you tell your dad?

595
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,168
- Yeah.
- What did he say?

596
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,470
- It grabs him.
- Grabs him?

597
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:13,873
It's me.

598
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,278
How's it going?

599
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,877
What are you doing now?

600
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,555
Thinking of me?

601
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:21,885
All the time?

602
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,653
Think of me all the time.
I think of you.

603
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,462
I need to see you.

604
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:29,029
Please!

605
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:32,961
I've had a shitty day.
Don't you start.

606
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,467
What are you wearing?

607
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:37,600
It matters. Pants? A dress?

608
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:42,004
God, I knew it!

609
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:44,039
What underneath?

610
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:45,874
Stockings? Panties?

611
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,982
You don't have to shout. Whisper.

612
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,484
Pantyhose? Any panties?

613
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:08,531
Do you love me or not?

614
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,239
You love me!

615
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,216
Do you still fuck him?

616
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,383
Do you still fuck Fabrice?

617
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,655
What's wrong with you?

618
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,759
I'm only asking if you fuck.
Yes or no?

619
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:32,894
You have no right to ask me that.

620
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,394
So that's it!

621
01:00:35,564 --> 01:00:38,431
When you leave me, you fuck him.

622
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:40,093
He's my husband!

623
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:42,465
I know. And what am I?

624
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,003
Why not ask me
if I fuck someone else?

625
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:47,472
It's none of my business.

626
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,579
Of course it is, if you love me.

627
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:54,746
- Do you fuck someone else?
- Yeah.

628
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,383
You fuck someone else?

629
01:00:58,454 --> 01:00:59,512
Careful!

630
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:25,905
Shut up.

631
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:29,577
Get off my ass!

632
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:32,554
I don't understand you!

633
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:35,713
This is all useless!
I'm sick of it!

634
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,165
Where? I can't see you.

635
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:22,796
What bus shelter?

636
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:24,839
I'm there.

637
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,446
I see you. I'm coming.

638
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,300
Is it bad?
Need a hospital?

639
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,966
Take me home.

640
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,605
Get a move on!

641
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,287
Lean forward.

642
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:20,827
Breathe deep.

643
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,604
What do you care
what happened to me?

644
01:03:40,949 --> 01:03:42,645
We're done talking, right?

645
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:56,161
You gonna sit there all day
staring at me like a mutt?

646
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:02,032
Suit yourself.
See if I care.

647
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:10,944
Shit!

648
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,620
What's the matter with you?

649
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:57,781
Stop it!

650
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:03,792
OK, now.

651
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:15,506
I was set to get half the site
just by putting up the cash deposit.

652
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:22,580
The site was valued at two million
but easily worth double.

653
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:24,848
Gently!

654
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,178
That hurt?

655
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:28,415
- Want another pill?
- I'm OK.

656
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:35,729
I figured a profit of 2.5 million
on 300,000...

657
01:05:36,398 --> 01:05:37,865
wasn't bad.

658
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,732
So I put up the cash and we signed.

659
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:49,336
A month later, I heard
the city had blocked the sale

660
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:52,915
so I asked him to pay back my cash.

661
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:57,575
He said sure, Monday, no problem.

662
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:00,384
Come Monday, zilch.

663
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:01,887
How long ago was it?

664
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,492
About... three months.

665
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:09,259
I kept at him
but he stopped taking my calls.

666
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,934
- Socks?
- Leave them on.

667
01:06:14,204 --> 01:06:17,661
When I heard he was in town,
I went there.

668
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:19,507
Who is he?

669
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:22,572
His name is...

670
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,071
Minskov.

671
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,143
You don't know him.
He's a Russian.

672
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,184
Where did you find him?

673
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:32,851
The Riviera, where else?

674
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,014
You don't say.

675
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,957
Can you handle it?

676
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:40,661
No answer?

677
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,686
What do you expect me to say?

678
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:49,427
- How's your fiancée?
- It's over.

679
01:06:58,948 --> 01:06:59,972
Call me!

680
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,882
What happened with my dad?

681
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,851
- That's why you wanted to see me?
- Not specially.

682
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:12,654
But I need to know what happened.
Shouldn't I care about him?

683
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:16,025
- No. He's the father, not you.
- I'm not sure anymore.

684
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:18,728
Did you walk out?

685
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,568
He dumped me.

686
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:26,165
Beat me to it by an inch.
He'd become a total pain.

687
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:28,502
Always griping and yelling at me.

688
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,076
You said you had fun.

689
01:07:31,046 --> 01:07:33,514
At first. It wore off.

690
01:07:37,085 --> 01:07:39,020
I'm going to ask you something.

691
01:07:40,188 --> 01:07:41,314
Go back to him.

692
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:43,655
Are you crazy?

693
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:45,417
Wait, I know what you'll say.

694
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:47,262
- I say no.
- Wait.

695
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:53,263
Think of it as a contract,

696
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:56,101
like a role in a film.

697
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,497
You act.
I'm the producer, I cough up.

698
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,865
How much do you get as a model?

699
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:05,077
I'll pay you the same.
No, double! It's worth it.

700
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:07,974
Just stick with him,

701
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:09,445
watch what he gets up to.

702
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:13,611
I'll call you twice a day
and you'll tell me if he's doing OK.

703
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:14,991
That's all.

704
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:18,149
If something goes wrong
or he starts acting weird

705
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:20,557
or you lose him,

706
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:22,028
give me a call.

707
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:24,258
See? Nothing to it, right?

708
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,860
I'm not a whore, you know.

709
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:33,729
What do you mean?
Who says you're a whore?

710
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,165
You.

711
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,905
You did. Robert told me.

712
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:41,577
I'm his son, right?
Can't expect miracles!

713
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:19,811
I know.

714
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,862
Mr. Minskov, please.

715
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,102
Did Mr. Minskov go out?

716
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:13,098
He's in the pool.
Should I call him?

717
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:14,868
Don't bother him.

718
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,932
St. James Albany Hotel?
Mr. Minskov, please.

719
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:47,873
It's personal.

720
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:57,678
Mr. Minskov?

721
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,585
I'm Mr. Seyr's son.
You don't know me...

722
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:04,919
Don't you speak French?

723
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,725
Don't speak French, asshole?
What an asshole!

724
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,599
You understand scumbag,
motherfucker?

725
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,634
I'll ram French up your ass!

726
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,136
Understand that?

727
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,236
Gloogloo?

728
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,636
You look pretty glooey!

729
01:11:21,776 --> 01:11:24,109
Listen! Money.
You understand that?

730
01:11:25,346 --> 01:11:27,541
Remember Robert Seyr, fuckwit?

731
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,151
Listen, Gloogloo...

732
01:12:30,011 --> 01:12:31,945
Can I talk to you, Miss?

733
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:34,673
- Hang on, there's a guy...
- I need to talk.

734
01:12:37,251 --> 01:12:39,049
Lotsa love. See you tomorrow.

735
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:40,644
Bye-bye.

736
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,414
- What?
- Minskov owes me money.

737
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,117
What do I care?

738
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:50,091
- Are those two apes always with him?
- I'm not talking to you.

739
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,062
You could answer my question!

740
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:53,496
Hands off!

741
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,498
I just want to meet Minskov.

742
01:12:57,674 --> 01:12:59,437
You're getting boring.

743
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,404
Minskov can drop dead.

744
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:02,908
Matter of fact,

745
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,604
I just need to call him and you're dead.

746
01:13:07,117 --> 01:13:08,208
I get it.

747
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,649
That's why you stay with him.

748
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:17,953
So you can say shit like
'I call him, you're dead.' What a buzz!

749
01:13:18,793 --> 01:13:19,987
I get it.

750
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:23,655
But it's the opposite, right?
You're scared shitless.

751
01:13:23,831 --> 01:13:25,891
You're shaking.
You have goosebumps.

752
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:29,469
- Wild, right?
- You need his permission to breathe.

753
01:13:30,138 --> 01:13:31,264
Are you done?

754
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:32,838
Fuck off.

755
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:55,462
- It's me.
- Again? Go away or I'll scream.

756
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:58,293
- No need to scream.
- You're a pain!

757
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:02,963
Tell me one thing.
I don't understand.

758
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:06,574
How old are you?
22, 23, 24?

759
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,573
You're young, not dumb.

760
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,710
Why stick with him?
You don't even speak Russian.

761
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:17,982
You don't need to.
He just fucks you and slaps you around.

762
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:23,254
Forget it.

763
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:26,290
Speak up. I can't hear you.
We're all alone.

764
01:14:26,494 --> 01:14:28,792
We can't see each other.
Just say...

765
01:14:31,699 --> 01:14:34,999
Whatever. I'm interested.
What did you do before?

766
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:40,465
I didn't hear. Say it again.

767
01:14:40,775 --> 01:14:43,244
I said I should stop...

768
01:14:45,446 --> 01:14:47,415
What are you doing?
Where are you?

769
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:49,411
You've moved!

770
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:51,781
What on earth...

771
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:52,979
Make room for me.

772
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:54,485
Move over!

773
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:57,286
Here I come!

774
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:03,759
What do you mean,
you only had him on the phone?

775
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:06,196
What did the bastard come up with?

776
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:09,064
Dad, you're gonna have
to forget your money.

777
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:11,368
Forget it.

778
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,871
Stop thinking about it,
stop counting it at night.

779
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:17,501
Write it off and move on.

780
01:15:18,346 --> 01:15:19,143
Why?

781
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,908
The guy's dangerous.
He's a thug, a killer.

782
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:25,483
He's not the Illouz brothers.
He's not one of us.

783
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:28,588
You crossed his path.
It was a mistake.

784
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,524
Forget it.

785
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:38,126
Hold on.
What did you talk about on the phone?

786
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:40,661
Just bullshit.

787
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:42,667
Didn't you try anything?

788
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,172
I told you, there's no way.

789
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:52,171
I fucked his girlfriend.

790
01:15:52,782 --> 01:15:54,646
You fucked his girlfriend?

791
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:01,216
I just told you.

792
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:05,717
I ask you to get my money back
and all you do is fuck his chick?

793
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:10,564
I don't believe it.
You're turning dumb.

794
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,265
You're turning very dumb.

795
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:20,802
You there, Dad?

796
01:17:15,363 --> 01:17:18,197
She said she'd gone off sex
since they split up.

797
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:20,163
I thought, no chance.

798
01:17:20,401 --> 01:17:23,963
We snort a line in the john.
Like hitting a magic button. Pow!

799
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:27,199
She goes sex-crazy.
Grabs my dick and sucks it.

800
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:30,176
Can't you say excuse me?

801
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:31,107
Sorry.

802
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,807
A real friend!

803
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,581
We went on to her girlfriend's place.

804
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:41,211
Her girlfriend, man!
We're at it till 5 AM.

805
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:45,754
I'm seeing her tonight.
I told Aline I'm eating with you.

806
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:48,919
OK, right.

807
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,374
Don't move.

808
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:07,776
Stay like that.

809
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,984
- What's the matter?
- Wait, please.

810
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:12,981
I'm cold.

811
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:14,813
Wait a second.

812
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:30,256
Really?

813
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,312
I'm off.

814
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,362
You think this'll help?

815
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:42,592
Thanks.

816
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,251
I heard you.

817
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,349
I know you're in there!

818
01:22:12,059 --> 01:22:13,084
Open up!

819
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:15,796
I've been ringing for hours!

820
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:17,954
- I was asleep.
- Get dressed and come.

821
01:22:18,132 --> 01:22:20,567
Verodin's buying the whole site!

822
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:23,568
- So?
- He's ready to sign tonight. Come on!

823
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:26,400
I'm not going out.
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

824
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:31,011
You heard me? Verodin's buying!
He's leaving tomorrow for two weeks.

825
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:34,843
- It can wait two weeks.
- It can't. He's waiting to sign now.

826
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,349
Move your foot please.

827
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,918
Come off it!
You know what Verodin's worth?

828
01:22:39,088 --> 01:22:42,079
Fuck him!
I need sleep. Move your foot.

829
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,655
Is this your piano crap?

830
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,488
- What's keeping you?
- He won't come, God knows why.

831
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:49,656
- Are you in there?
- I'm not going out.

832
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:52,833
Mind explaining?

833
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:55,195
I don't want to.
I have a big day tomorrow.

834
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:57,835
What's big about tomorrow?

835
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:00,964
Does it concern Sami and me?

836
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:02,910
Go to hell.

837
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:04,569
What's he up to?

838
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:08,313
Where are you?

839
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,476
Cut the crap. Open up!

840
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:15,352
It's not only your money, it's ours too.
You can't do this to us!

841
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:20,324
Open this fucking door.

842
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:24,626
I'll kick it in. And your head!

843
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,063
Stop it! They'll call the cops.

844
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:33,934
- Which way?
- Don't ask me!

845
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:42,981
OK, got it!

846
01:24:10,544 --> 01:24:12,979
Wait! He wants to
see the place again.

847
01:24:13,313 --> 01:24:14,372
He wants another look.

848
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,345
- Now?
- Now. Come on.

849
01:24:16,517 --> 01:24:17,951
For Christ's sake!

850
01:25:23,484 --> 01:25:25,646
- Bring the keys.
- For fuck's sake!

851
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:27,516
Gimme the keys.

852
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:32,216
Get a move on!

853
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,352
- What's up?
- Some jerks moved in upstairs.

854
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:38,021
- What are you going to do?
- Guess.

855
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:45,601
Move it!

856
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:12,225
Rise and shine!
Snap, crackle, pop!

857
01:26:14,635 --> 01:26:17,001
You got music? Cool!

858
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:00,403
Thomas Seyr?

859
01:28:01,008 --> 01:28:02,498
You're next.

860
01:28:03,077 --> 01:28:04,942
The Toccata in E minor, right?

861
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:09,044
You can sit there if you like.

862
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:39,713
Call me, we'll meet.

863
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:41,315
Don't let me down.

864
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:46,214
Thomas Seyr is here.

865
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:48,578
Come!

866
01:28:51,592 --> 01:28:52,991
All set?

867
01:28:53,462 --> 01:28:56,226
You're going to play
the Toccata in E Minor?

868
01:28:56,398 --> 01:28:58,591
Mind starting with the fugue?

869
01:28:58,732 --> 01:29:00,131
No, sure.

870
01:29:55,524 --> 01:29:57,013
Want to start over?

871
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,459
I don't understand it.

872
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,157
I can play this piece.

873
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:40,466
By myself, I play it fine.

874
01:30:41,804 --> 01:30:44,830
Don't worry.
Call me when you're ready.

875
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:14,629
I'm sorry.

876
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:40,652
Dad?

877
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:57,292
Two years later

878
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:01,618
- Hear me?
- Yes, Mr. Seyr.

879
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:04,356
I'm done. Don't let
anybody on stage.

880
01:35:04,531 --> 01:35:05,931
OK, Mr. Seyr.

881
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:13,829
Everything OK?

882
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:17,177
- How did it go?
- OK.

883
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:18,902
Did they take pictures?

884
01:35:19,947 --> 01:35:21,381
Were they nice to you?

885
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:26,714
- Want to sit in the back?
- No, in front with you.

886
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:46,965
- How do you feel?
- I'm aching all over.

887
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,500
Are we late?

888
01:35:49,909 --> 01:35:51,103
We're fine.

889
01:35:53,379 --> 01:35:56,349
I changed the tour dates
for Lyon and Geneva.

890
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:59,110
Did I mention the dinner with EMI UK?

891
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,416
Eyvind Johnson's in Paris next week.

892
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:03,784
He wants to see you.

893
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:05,619
Which evening's best?

894
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:06,919
I don't know.

895
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:08,753
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

896
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:12,355
Is it still sore?

897
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:15,061
Let me.

898
01:36:35,022 --> 01:36:36,182
Umbrella!

899
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:40,790
I'll park and come.

900
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:46,363
Door, dammit!

901
01:38:03,676 --> 01:38:04,974
What is it?

902
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,507
Do I know you?

903
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,152
Minskov?
