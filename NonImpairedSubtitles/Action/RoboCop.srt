1
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Enjoy!

2
00:00:57,822 --> 00:01:00,207
What if I told you
that even the worst

3
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:04,155
neighborhood in America
could be made completely safe.

4
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,048
What if I told you that
this could be accomplished

5
00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:10,917
without risking the life
of one single law enforcement officer.

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,599
How do I know this? Because
this is happening right now.

7
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,358
In every country in the world but this one

8
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:25,396
I'm Pat Novak, and welcome to the Novak
Element.

9
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:30,065
In tonight's State of
the Union segment,

10
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,870
we'll be joined by
General, "Curtis Monroe"

11
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,300
live from the war room in the Pentagon.

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,100
General "Monroe", Welcome back.

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,599
Good to see you, "Pat".

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,599
Thank you for this unprecedented
access to your operations.

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Can you walk us through
what we're seeing here.

16
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,199
This is a routine
operation, We found that

17
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:53,354
random patrols help
the local population.

18
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:55,599
Feel safer, and to trust us.

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,661
It's amazing.

20
00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:00,600
And, what are these colored dots
that we're seeing here general?

21
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,120
These are our assets on the ground.

22
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,347
In green we got the "ED209s"
They're the big boys.

23
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:09,421
They secure the perimeter.

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,365
Purple are the smaller "EM
208s" They sweep and mop up.

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,313
And the red dots Pat that's your film crew.

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,316
It's great to see
American machines helping

27
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,625
to promote peace and
freedom abroad.

28
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,600
This is standard Op alright, there
is no opposition expected.

29
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,729
I'm gonna set your markers to code red.

30
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,193
All our drones are going to give
top priority to your safety.

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,562
No red assets have ever been lost.

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
OK

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
Does this make you feel better?

34
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,417
But listen, keep those
bracelets on you completely safe.

35
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:45,167
Okay? Good.

36
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
Enjoy the show!

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,600
Alright, let's go.

38
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:02,100
(Robotic voice) May peace be upon you.

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,480
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised.

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,297
For a non-evasive
scanning procedure.

41
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:10,743
No one will be harmed.

42
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,386
Please exit your homes
with your arms raised.

43
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,459
For a non-evasive
scanning procedure.

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,209
Scott, get me a shot of this.

45
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:52,307
Incredible. Incredible!

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,429
Not long ago that would
have been American

47
00:03:55,455 --> 00:03:58,089
men and women
risking their lives.

48
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,600
To pacify these people.

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,001
General, care to comment on this?

50
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,516
Well, Pat, We had Vietnam, we
had Iraq we had Afghanistan,

51
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:14,494
Never again. From a military
perspective this has been invaluable.

52
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,407
We can accomplish our objectives
without any loss to American lives.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,040
And I think the honest people
over there really appreciate it.

54
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,600
Why wouldn't they?

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,641
For the first time in their lives, they
get to watch their children grow up.

56
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:33,562
In an environment of safety and security.

57
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Let's go

58
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,256
Kelly, can you
hear me out there?

59
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,485
Loud and clear Pat.
I'm here in Sunny Tehran.

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,521
Where locals have clearly
embraced these routine scans.

61
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,391
As you can see behind me, they are
working in collaboration with the robots.

62
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,990
And obviously their safety
is everyone's top priority.

63
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,027
You'll notice children in the streets
as well, this is every day life.

64
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,600
Happening in perfect harmony.

65
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,198
Oh great, here here, stay put, stay put.
It's fine don't worry my guys got it.

66
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:08,522
Drop your weapon.

67
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
"Kelly, Kelly," Are you alright?

68
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,099
"Kelly."

69
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,600
We're okay, Pat.

70
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
I'm sorry Kelly but

71
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:25,234
for security reasons the Pentagon
is going to cut our feed to Tehran.

72
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,422
But Please be careful.

73
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,100
Yeah, I'll continue to stand by.

74
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Now you see how fundamental these
robots are to our foreign policy.

75
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:42,240
So then tell me, why can't we use
these machines here at home?

76
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:47,600
Why is America so robophobic?

77
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,350
On the one hand, we have Raymond Sellers.

78
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,251
An entrepreneur,

79
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,146
And true American, who's product
just saved my colleague's life.

80
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,600
On the other, "Hubert Dreyfuss".

81
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,469
A man with both feet
planted firmly in the past

82
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,844
who's bill prohibits the
use of drones on US soil.

83
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:15,428
The American people
support the Dreyfuss act.

84
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,824
Because they haven't

85
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,625
experienced this technology.

86
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:21,600
And they fear what they don't understand.

87
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,245
We at the Novak Element
support Mr. Seller's

88
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,402
to make our country and our viewers safer.

89
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,501
After all, what's more important then
the safety of the American people?

90
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Hey "Murphy".

91
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Hey.

92
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,033
How is Jack?

93
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
We don't know yet.

94
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
How's it going?

95
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Good.

96
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
What the hell are they doing here?

97
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:24,600
Six in the morgue, Louis in hospital.

98
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,600
This was the mother of all bad ideas.

99
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:28,931
We got a lead on Anton
Vallon, we took it.

100
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:30,600
What lead?

101
00:09:30,795 --> 00:09:32,600
Not in front of them.

102
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:33,820
This is bullshit.

103
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,618
Yeah?

104
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,233
Yeah, you got something to say Murphy?

105
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,277
Vallon's our case.

106
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:40,020
You got two years without
no arrests, no nothin.

107
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:41,823
He's got to be dumb or dirty.

108
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:44,600
You got something on us?
Or is this personal?

109
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:46,600
No, it's nothin personal.

110
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,599
Although I don't like you as a person.

111
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Okay, you two, out.

112
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,600
No problem.

113
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,669
Maybe if you hadn't gone
off the reservation

114
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,442
your partner would
still be standing.

115
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,100
What did you say to me?
That's enough!

116
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Okay, "Alex".

117
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
It's just you and me now.

118
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,354
Me and jack, we've been
doing some street buys.

119
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,354
We get a line on some guns.

120
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,106
And we met with this low
level G called Jerry who

121
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:18,536
ends up having a peace
he's not suppose to have.

122
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,907
Where the hell you get
a gun like that, Jerry

123
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:23,016
I can get you two whole crates full, man.

124
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Two crates?

125
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:27,412
No disrespect Jay, but how a clown
like you get so much product, man?

126
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:29,016
What's it matter
where it comes from?

127
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,912
It matters, we don't want
no dirty guns Jerry.

128
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:33,178
These guns got bodies on them Jerry?

129
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,849
They're clean alright. You
gonna buy this shit or not?

130
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,224
Why you acting so nervous man?

131
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,833
You fishin on us Jerry?

132
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
What'd you say?

133
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
You think he's fishin D'?

134
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:43,272
I think he's fishin on us.

135
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:44,599
What the hell are
they talkin about man?

136
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,021
Let me see your phone,
let me see your phone

137
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,776
I'm not showing you my phone, man.

138
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:49,443
Are you recording this?

139
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,406
What?

140
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,599
I think you're a God Damn cop.

141
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
What the hell are you talking about, man?

142
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,599
Lie down to the ground.

143
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Put your gun down.

144
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,599
We're not cops alright, we
work for, "Anton Vallon".

145
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Hey, Hey, Hey!

146
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,990
Shut up, shut up, what did you say?

147
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,599
Ends up he works for "Vallon".

148
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Before the meeting we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.

149
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:09,188
They were supposed to
be in our evidence room.

150
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:11,910
Not out on the street.
The intake

151
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:14,213
papers were blank,
no signatures.

152
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
What have you got?

153
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Nothing.

154
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,188
How do you think that happened?

155
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,599
I tell you Murphy this is a mistake.

156
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,667
These guys will shoot you
just to see if they gun work.

157
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
We need backup.

158
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:30,350
We call for backup words going
to get around the station.

159
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,823
And he's going to disappear.

160
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,600
It's gonna be alright.

161
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,402
We told Vallon we were gun
buyers, and he bought it.

162
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,369
What do you two need
with that much product?

163
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:41,625
You plotting a coup?

164
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:45,323
Hey, don't trip. We ain't gonna
bust a single shot in your town.

165
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:47,802
We got some problems back
home with Chicago PD.

166
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:48,438
Yeah,

167
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
I heard you don't like cops.

168
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Hey, boss.

169
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,943
What do you got for me?

170
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:57,823
Really.

171
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,599
Just about to close the deal.

172
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,896
Someone tipped him off.

173
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,381
Gentlemen I gotta deal with this.

174
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,917
Few minutes.

175
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:14,282
Make sure you kill them both.

176
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,584
I've got two handguns, one automatic.

177
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,089
You've gotta get out of here, I'm
going to take the automatic.

178
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,225
You sure of this?

179
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,152
You ready?

180
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Move

181
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Louis.

182
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,547
Officer down, officer down, 331 Hamilton.

183
00:13:56,678 --> 00:14:00,026
This is detective Alex Murphy in need
of immediate medical assistance.

184
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:02,537
331 Hamilton Road.

185
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
"Jack."

186
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
"Jack," come on "Jack,"
Do you hear me?

187
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
"Jack," Stay with me.

188
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
"Jack."

189
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:18,600
"Alex," you don't do something like
this unless you bring it to me first.

190
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:24,395
Vallon's connected. I'm warning you don't
make any more moves until I vet this.

191
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,130
If officers are supplying them guns.

192
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:27,975
That's up to IAD.

193
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:30,073
I'll handle it.

194
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Washington, DC

195
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,600
I don't care how sophisticated
these machines are Mr. Sellers.

196
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:45,230
A machine does not know what
it feels like to be human.

197
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,495
Can't understand the value of human life.
Why should it be aloud to take one?

198
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:57,428
To legislate over life and death, we need
people who understand right from wrong.

199
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,954
What do your machines feel?

200
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:05,521
Well, they feel no anger, the feel
no prejudice, they feel no fatigue.

201
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,515
Which makes them ideal
for law enforcement.

202
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:15,761
Putting these machines on the streets
will save countless American lives.

203
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:17,547
Your evading the question.
No I'm not.

204
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,823
Yes, your evading the question. I
asked "What do these machines feel?"

205
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,558
If one of them, uh,
killed a child.

206
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,811
What would it feel?

207
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Nothing.

208
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:34,099
That's the problem.

209
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:40,105
That's why 72 percent of Americans will not
stand for a robot pulling the trigger.

210
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,381
America is the world's most valuable
market, and we can't touch it.

211
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:55,474
With a domestic expansion we'd clear
600 billion dollars per annual.

212
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,589
In other words, every second that law
is in existence we're hemorrhaging money.

213
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,901
What do you want me to do?
We've thrown cash at

214
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:05,161
senators on both sides of the isle.
Nobody's budging.

215
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,196
They don't want to
vote against their

216
00:16:07,222 --> 00:16:09,625
constituents, so unless
we sway public opinion.

217
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:12,130
The battles lost.
Now to that effect.

218
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,457
My team have come up with a
pretty aggressive new campaign.

219
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Wow factor off the charts.

220
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:22,600
We need to give the Americans
a product they can love.

221
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:24,600
A figure they can rally behind.

222
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:26,402
Sir, I have dissected this bill.

223
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:30,339
There are no loop holes. We can't
put a machine on the street.

224
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,600
Forget the machine,
you saw the polls.

225
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:35,396
Americans don't want a machine.

226
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,600
They want a product with a conscious.

227
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,308
They want.

228
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:46,218
Something that knows.

229
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:51,707
What it feels like to be human.

230
00:16:57,963 --> 00:17:00,672
We're gonna put a man
inside the machine.

231
00:17:04,176 --> 00:17:08,160
You're not you because of your
legs, your arms, your hands.

232
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,864
You're you because of your brain.
It's your brain's

233
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,501
capacity to process information
that makes you who you are.

234
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Relax, and just do what
you've always done.

235
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:25,600
I've never played with these.

236
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:30,443
The music doesn't come from your fingers
Michael, it comes from your mind.

237
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,047
All you have to do is let it out.

238
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,600
Please.

239
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:07,387
Oh my God.

240
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
That's okay.

241
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,428
His emotions are peaking, the
readings are getting clouded.

242
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,787
It's okay.

243
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,182
Relax, if you get too
emotional, it'll change the

244
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:25,972
chemistry in your brain.
It'll throw the system out.

245
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,391
You're doing great. Come on.

246
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:47,600
I need emotion to play.

247
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,129
(Speaking french)

248
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:54,600
It's a beautiful piece,
Dennett can we have a moment?

249
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Thank you.

250
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,389
We have agreed on this a
long time ago Raymond.

251
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,779
I, I, I wouldn't be asked to
develop combat application.

252
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:07,504
My work here is driven
by it's own question.

253
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,454
And your work is brilliant, but
your ideas are being underutilized.

254
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Look, I think I found a way.

255
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,051
To put real revenue stream
behind your research,

256
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:21,010
and to save thousands of
lives in the process.

257
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,428
You're not keeping up your end,
making me exposed like that.

258
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:38,448
Detective Murphy's just
a little impulsive.

259
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:41,118
So, put him on the payroll, Why
are we talking about this?

260
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,425
It won't work. And now that his partner
got hit he's never going to let it go.

261
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,482
What is that?

262
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:48,383
Louis' hospital.
Alex is dropping by this afternoon.

263
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:50,408
In case you want to send flowers.

264
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,949
Yeah.

265
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:59,256
Kill a cop, look over my
shoulder the rest of my life.

266
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:01,486
It's not good for business.

267
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,621
Who do you thinks going
to be investigating you"?

268
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:11,881
I'm going to go hard after them, Dennis.

269
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:17,052
And have them in bracelets within a month.

270
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:21,037
Hey, Vallon I'm locking up right now.

271
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Camera's off?

272
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Clear.

273
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,636
You were right, we should've had backup.

274
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,146
I'm sorry.

275
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
You're not really sleeping are you?

276
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Asshole.

277
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,381
Sergeant, "Thomas Ryan," NYPD,
paralyzed from the waist down.

278
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,287
He has let himself go a little.

279
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Since the accident.

280
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:54,319
Pass Yep, yeah,

281
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:55,596
fair enough.

282
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:59,100
The officer "Alfred Miller", Denver.

283
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,599
Severe...

284
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,372
Seri, cerebellerd..

285
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:04,011
Cerebellum ataxia.

286
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:05,599
That's why you're the Doctor, Doctor.

287
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:09,433
He scored through the roof
with our urban demos.

288
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
Lets keep this one in
mind, I like this guy.

289
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Very good sir, I saved the best for last.

290
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:19,365
I give you Sargent "Jack
Freeman" Masculinity incarnate.

291
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:23,401
Led Pittsburgh Swat for five years, now.

292
00:21:23,485 --> 00:21:25,178
Confined to a wheel chair.

293
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,600
I think I can see the appeal.

294
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
No.

295
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
What? Why?

296
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:35,433
I checked the Psych evaluations.
He's far too unstable.

297
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:37,401
He's trying to say, that he has a temper.

298
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,177
Have you any idea what we'd
be putting him through?

299
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:43,600
The psychological strain requires
someone emotionally balanced.

300
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,068
We have to be scientific.

301
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,282
We're not selling a soft-drink here are we?

302
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,968
You're right, okay,
Keep looking.

303
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,599
"David," What did I say?

304
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,317
Not until you're finished.

305
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,599
Hey guys.

306
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Hi dad.

307
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,287
Hey little monkey.

308
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,881
How's the game buddy?

309
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:10,099
Dane got rejected, but we
have a two man advantage.

310
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,391
Oh yeah? That's fantastic.

311
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,235
Hey D, why don't you head upstairs,
start getting ready for bed?

312
00:22:16,495 --> 00:22:18,292
But he just got home.

313
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,235
I'll be up in a second to tuck you in okay?

314
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Alright?

315
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:27,600
Now give your Mom a kiss.

316
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,899
Good night baby.

317
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,600
Too slow boy.

318
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
You're just too slow.

319
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,187
How is Jack holding up?

320
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,230
They said a week till
he's back on his feet.

321
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
It's my fault, we shouldn't
have even been there.

322
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Here.

323
00:23:55,574 --> 00:23:57,574
(Car alarm)
Somebody's gotta fix that.

324
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Stop.

325
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,454
Let's not wake up David.

326
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,900
He's suffering 4th degree burns
over 80 percent of his body.

327
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,900
Lower spine has been severed.

328
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,351
If he survives.

329
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,900
He'll be paralyzed from the waist
down, confined to a wheel chair.

330
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Mrs. Murphy.

331
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,900
We don't have to do this.

332
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,900
I need to know everything
before I make a decision.

333
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,384
Please continue.

334
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:31,269
Consider the cochlear optic nerves
have been critically damaged.

335
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
He'll be blind in one eye.

336
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,956
And most likely deaf.

337
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:40,763
Frankly, Dr. Norton and the Omni
foundation are the leaders in this field.

338
00:25:41,154 --> 00:25:44,866
In my opinion, this is the
only chance your husband has.

339
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:47,236
I'd seriously
consider their offer.

340
00:25:49,978 --> 00:25:52,353
I'm sorry, Doctor.

341
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:53,727
I need time to think

342
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:57,988
I'm afraid Mrs. Murphy, time
is one thing you don't have.

343
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,165
You say you can save him,
but what does that mean?

344
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,389
What kind of life will he have?

345
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Thanks.

346
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Thanks buddy.

347
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,505
You know this is going
to make me dance again.

348
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,257
Now that I gotta see.

349
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:34,699
You don't wanna see that.

350
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,699
Here she comes now.

351
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,069
Hold on to that.

352
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:39,501
Good idea partner.

353
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Every time.

354
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:47,700
Get er' boy!

355
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:07,690
Subject is still dreaming.

356
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:13,500
He's retrieving memories, trying to make
sense of sensory stimulation package 37.

357
00:27:14,374 --> 00:27:16,249
Perfect Kim.

358
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,170
Let's reconnect the spine.

359
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Time to wake him up.

360
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,500
Excuse me?

361
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:53,500
What are you doing here?

362
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:55,500
Babe, where are you going?

363
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
"Louis."

364
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,651
Subject regaining cognitive functions.

365
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:16,500
Whats happening?

366
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Where am I?

367
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:21,676
You were in an explosion, Alex.

368
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:23,500
You're in a hospital.

369
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Where?

370
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,327
Where's "Claire" My wife? Where is my wife?

371
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I want you to calm down Alex, listen to
me, you're okay. You're family's fine.

372
00:28:33,604 --> 00:28:35,500
Both your wife and your son.

373
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,499
Who the hell are you?

374
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton

375
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,499
I'm treating you.

376
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Heart rate rising.

377
00:28:45,341 --> 00:28:46,825
I can't move.

378
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,499
I can't move. What the hell is all that?

379
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,499
Visual input, unstable.

380
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
I want you to relax.

381
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:56,979
Subject's dumping too much
epinephrine, should we purge him?

382
00:28:57,046 --> 00:28:58,046
Not yet.

383
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
Unlock vertebrate.

384
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,217
Go ahead, Kim. Unlock
Upper, Lower extremities.

385
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:25,119
What kind of suit is this?

386
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
It's life.

387
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Your suit "Alex".

388
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
It's You.

389
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:39,036
This was the only option, We're here,
all of us, to make you whole again.

390
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Full body

391
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,260
I want you to walk, now Alex.

392
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
You can do that

393
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
seems so real

394
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:18,161
Alex it's very important you
understand what's happening.

395
00:30:18,437 --> 00:30:22,291
This is real. It's not a dream,
it's not drugs, or anesthetics.

396
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,911
I know I'm dreaming, because
I can feel all of this.

397
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:27,577
Alex, Amputees can often feel
their missing appendages.

398
00:30:27,603 --> 00:30:29,337
It's called Phantom
Limb sensation.

399
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,276
What do you mean amputee?
What the hell did you do to me?

400
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:33,385
Alex you need to relax.

401
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,499
Take this off of me now.

402
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,380
Alex you need to relax

403
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:38,640
I need to get out of this thing.
What did you do to me?

404
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:40,045
What have you done to me?

405
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:43,499
Alex, HEY!

406
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,499
Shut him down!

407
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,770
No! Let him run, Let him run!

408
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Where am I?

409
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
"Alex," Please.

410
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Stop.

411
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,911
"Alex," you have to stop.

412
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Please.

413
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
"Alex."

414
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Please stop.

415
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,365
Stay where you are, and
we'll come and pick you up.

416
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Okay, "Kim".

417
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,360
Shut him down.

418
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
"Alex."

419
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:00,922
You can't run from this.

420
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,500
You have to understand the
reality of the situation.

421
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:12,097
Show me.

422
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
"Kim."

423
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
No.

424
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:42,249
Holy Christ.

425
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:44,500
Holy Christ!

426
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,488
Holy Christ there's nothing left!

427
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Your body may have gone,
but your still here.

428
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:07,628
That's not even my brain.

429
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:10,505
We had to repair the damaged areas.

430
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:13,500
But we didn't interfere with
your emotion, or your intellect.

431
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:15,499
You understand me, Alex.

432
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,662
You're, You're in control

433
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:21,982
I'm in control?

434
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:23,310
Yes.

435
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:27,034
Okay,

436
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:31,116
If I'm in control.

437
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Then, I want to die.

438
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:42,447
Just unplug what ever it is keeping
me alive and end this nightmare!

439
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:47,991
Let's say I did that, which as a doctor
would be almost impossible for me.

440
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:50,016
But, say I did.

441
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:53,500
What do I say to your wife?

442
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,499
What does she say to your son?

443
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
That it didn't work.

444
00:34:57,138 --> 00:35:01,409
That you tried, but something went wrong.

445
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:06,294
You did everything you could but...

446
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,499
I died.

447
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,656
And so, after all they've
been through all the pain.

448
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:17,536
All their hope restored,
we just rip that away?

449
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:22,500
Your wife loves you Alex. She
singed the consent forms, herself.

450
00:35:22,682 --> 00:35:27,005
Otherwise you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.

451
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:40,794
She loves you and she
gave you a second chance.

452
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,684
I need you to take it.

453
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:53,802
I don't want to see myself like this again.

454
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:55,953
Ever.

455
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,500
The same goes for my family.

456
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:08,738
Put me back in.

457
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,832
Zoom in.

458
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,406
Stop.

459
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:20,432
Zoom in.

460
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
Stop.

461
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:31,399
Accept the connection.

462
00:36:35,983 --> 00:36:38,499
It's so good to finally see you.

463
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,753
I was gonna have to say the same thing.

464
00:36:42,823 --> 00:36:43,823
I'm sorry

465
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:46,770
I know how I must look to you.

466
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
I think you look beautiful.

467
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:55,698
Are they treating you okay, babe?

468
00:36:56,473 --> 00:36:57,473
So far.

469
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Dr. Norton seems like a nice guy.

470
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:03,452
Does David know you're calling?

471
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,592
He misses you.
I can go get him, I just.

472
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:11,608
No

473
00:37:12,753 --> 00:37:15,500
I don't want him to see me like this.

474
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Not yet.

475
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:19,901
Sure.

476
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,442
We're going to get through this baby.

477
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,500
We're going to make it like it was.

478
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,666
When are you coming home?

479
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:41,500
We still got some tests.

480
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:46,373
But they are saying it's going really well.

481
00:37:46,614 --> 00:37:48,614
The minute they let me

482
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:52,500
I gotta go

483
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I love you.

484
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:58,051
End the connection.

485
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:15,500
Okay, blood cleansing initiated.

486
00:38:16,048 --> 00:38:20,500
Viral, and bacterial
screening activated.

487
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,499
Releasing proteins.

488
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Fats, Minerals, and Carbs.

489
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Energy in-flow is at 1320 Kilo-Calories.

490
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:44,494
Now starting Anti-inflammatory corticoid,
hormones and antibiotic protocols.

491
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Standard daily intake.

492
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:51,500
Who has Anti-depressants?

493
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:55,494
Let's give him a nice dream.

494
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:08,343
Alright, here's what you're dealing with.

495
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Modified M2 Battle Rifle.

496
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,097
50 caliber Beowulf ammunition,
and 30 round clips.

497
00:39:14,123 --> 00:39:15,525
3 Shot burst or full auto.

498
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:18,499
Heavy Duty.

499
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,140
TSR-66 Cartridge driven taser pistol.

500
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:24,228
Each projectile releases
up to 200,000 volts.

501
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,499
It can stun, it can kill, it's nasty shit.

502
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,093
Your armor. State of the
art but not invulnerable.

503
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:33,875
50 caliber or larger can
penetrate and kill, multiple

504
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:37,988
hits and guess who ends
up in the recycling bin.

505
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
If you sense you need a
weapon, or are threatened.

506
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:47,203
The visor goes down, and the
system makes the weapon available.

507
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,064
Gotta remember, it's not
the weapons that count.

508
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,499
It's who's handling them.

509
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,499
Or in your case ..What..

510
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Do you think you can do this?

511
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,030
Just stick to your job.

512
00:39:57,055 --> 00:39:58,499
Just stick to my job?

513
00:39:58,593 --> 00:40:01,473
Combat robots are my job doc.
Rio, Congo, you name it.

514
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,499
I was there. Our machines run perfectly.

515
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,500
You ask me, sticking an organic in
the system is a huge step backwards.

516
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,663
I don't care how well you
design this thing, without

517
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:12,499
my sign off it better
start learning chinese.

518
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Because it ain't never going home.

519
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,947
It's nice to meet you too.

520
00:40:25,004 --> 00:40:28,526
Lets do this, Tin man.

521
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,499
Quality control EM208, Vs. Tin man..

522
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,244
Rendering Scenario one, now.

523
00:40:41,515 --> 00:40:46,973
Hey, Doc. I hope you don't mind.
I like a little music while I'm working.

524
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,499
Alright, Alright, lets
uh, let the games begin.

525
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Rock and roll.

526
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Commence scenario.

527
00:41:31,474 --> 00:41:33,474
Lag in the corners.

528
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Did you see that? What my robot did.
That's how you do it.

529
00:41:39,484 --> 00:41:41,499
Your products afraid.

530
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,499
2.3 seconds behind.

531
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Great.

532
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Drop your gun!

533
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,499
Drop your gun!

534
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,499
Drop your weapon let the kid go.

535
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,499
He's worried that the
kids going to get hurt.

536
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Let the kid go!

537
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:05,223
Well, there you have it 5.6 seconds behind.
Scenario failure.

538
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,389
I wouldn't buy that for a dollar.

539
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,499
Let's do it again.

540
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
It's your funeral.

541
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,156
Detective, "Alex Murphy".

542
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,499
Search results: Detective Alex
Murphy making a speedy recovery.

543
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
"Alex Murphy" Man or machine.

544
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,181
Thrust into the spotlight,
Clair Murphy won't talk.

545
00:42:30,754 --> 00:42:32,499
"Anton Vallon."

546
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,239
Search Results: DPD says Anton
Vallon is no longer suspect.

547
00:42:36,385 --> 00:42:38,385
Due to lack of evidence

548
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,380
Detroit free press.

549
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:45,562
Unfortunately Murphy's
investigation into

550
00:42:45,588 --> 00:42:48,967
Anton Vallon wasn't authorized
in the first place.

551
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:51,499
Murphy was simply over zealous, Okay?

552
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,088
We have absolutely no evidence linking
Vallon to the attempt on his life.

553
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,232
All I'm gonna say is that my
partner's a great cop. And I won't

554
00:42:58,258 --> 00:43:01,207
rest until the men who tried to
kill him are brought to justice.

555
00:43:03,979 --> 00:43:05,979
What's wrong with him?

556
00:43:06,004 --> 00:43:08,004
No, Nothing, Nothing.

557
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:11,729
Watch the procedure bar on the 20A.

558
00:43:12,343 --> 00:43:16,223
Our machine assesses
the threat and acts.

559
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,056
That's it, two steps. Now watch Alex.

560
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,838
The software assesses the
threat just like robots.

561
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,499
And it sends the information to the brain.
Alex's brain receives.

562
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,975
The information and then
decides what to do with

563
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:34,500
it based on his emotional
and cognitive abilities.

564
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:38,500
Then the brain relates
this to the AI module.

565
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,499
And...

566
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,499
Yeah, like a year later.

567
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
Computers finish the job, a brain...

568
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:46,500
You wanted a man inside a machine!

569
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:50,265
That's what you've got, but the human
element will always be present.

570
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,760
Fear, instinct, bias, compassion. They
will always interfere with the system.

571
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:55,499
Okay, but Dennett

572
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,455
I've gotta give the
American people something

573
00:43:58,481 --> 00:44:01,243
they can root for.
Something aspirational. Right?

574
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,950
They have to believe in this thing.
Pretty good,

575
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:06,125
that's not-I don't
know how to sell okay.

576
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,500
We, you and I, have got a release date.
We've gotta make it, okay"?

577
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,499
I don't care how you do it, I'm asking you.
Come on can you help me? Just get him -

578
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,739
to do that. Him to do that.

579
00:44:16,764 --> 00:44:17,498
He's a machine

580
00:44:17,499 --> 00:44:19,499
I know but it's a man inside of a machine.

581
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,499
That's a man inside a machine.

582
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,499
His life depends on it, and the
future of Omnicorp depends on it.

583
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,796
So, get your ass back to
China and get it fixed.

584
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:30,479
I don't care how you do it, just go do it.

585
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,500
Tastes like peanut butter

586
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,508
I can't get it out of my mouth.

587
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:56,499
You don't like peanut butter?

588
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,500
No.

589
00:44:59,161 --> 00:45:00,499
You like peanut butter Kim?

590
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,500
I love it.

591
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,500
OK

592
00:45:05,895 --> 00:45:07,499
I'm gonna put you to sleep now Alex.

593
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,500
OK

594
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,603
Put him under, Kim.

595
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,460
What are you planning to do?

596
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:27,020
Consciousness is nothing more then
the processing of information.

597
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
I'm going to him.

598
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,180
He won't know the difference

599
00:45:45,437 --> 00:45:46,437
Raymond.

600
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,499
Yeah.

601
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,500
We just ran focus groups at
Ryan Correctional facility.

602
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,500
We call this combat mode.

603
00:45:54,777 --> 00:45:57,329
It really put the fear of
God into the prisoners.

604
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,499
Yeah, that's okay.

605
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
Get a load of this.

606
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,499
What is that?

607
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,213
He transforms. Kids love it.

608
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,499
Really?

609
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,390
Focus group numbers, through the roof.

610
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,499
Really?

611
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,499
That's really embarrassing.

612
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,499
What is this?

613
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,499
You know what,

614
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,322
People don't really know what they want
until you show it to them most of the time.

615
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:24,427
Make him more uh.. tactical
Make him look uhh...

616
00:46:24,973 --> 00:46:27,500
Let's go with black.

617
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,170
Yeah.

618
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,499
"Alex."

619
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,796
He looks like a billion dollars.

620
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
$2.6 billion.

621
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
"Raymond Sells"

622
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:14,920
I've looked forward to
meeting you detective.

623
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,264
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.

624
00:47:17,343 --> 00:47:22,177
Well, We've found this program to
give men like you a second chance.

625
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,937
You just do your best today.

626
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,499
Shall we?

627
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,500
Alright.

628
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,026
Mr. Sellers We're ready for you.

629
00:47:31,203 --> 00:47:32,203
Okay great.

630
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:33,499
This is a detective "Sherman".

631
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,500
Good morning folks.

632
00:47:37,504 --> 00:47:39,848
Okay, so this is how it's gonna be.

633
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,958
We're going toe to toe.

634
00:47:42,124 --> 00:47:43,405
The last man standing wins.

635
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,813
If I hit you, you go back
to the drawing board.

636
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:49,109
You hit me
You get a ticket back home.

637
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:51,648
My guys are going to be
shooting .47 rounds.

638
00:47:51,674 --> 00:47:54,218
Do a little damage, but
they can't take you out.

639
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:57,556
But make no mistake, Tin Man. My gun will.

640
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:14,835
Alex, listen to me.

641
00:48:14,836 --> 00:48:17,490
The EM208s will try to maneuver you.

642
00:48:17,491 --> 00:48:19,621
So Mattox can get a clear shot.

643
00:48:19,622 --> 00:48:21,620
Do not let that happen.

644
00:48:22,254 --> 00:48:25,595
If Mattox hits you everything but
your life support will shut down.

645
00:48:25,596 --> 00:48:28,606
You will feel more pain then
you've ever felt in your life.

646
00:48:28,607 --> 00:48:31,554
I don't know about that
I've been through a lot.

647
00:48:37,734 --> 00:48:39,035
Alright.

648
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,436
I say we go on Three.

649
00:48:41,437 --> 00:48:42,738
Three.

650
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,862
How's it going down there?

651
00:49:08,474 --> 00:49:11,425
Whatever you do, don't
get shot in the face.

652
00:49:48,024 --> 00:49:51,115
Dr. Norton, how is he doing that?

653
00:49:51,538 --> 00:49:55,249
His software is faster,
his hardware is stronger.

654
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,631
He is a better machine.

655
00:49:59,402 --> 00:50:01,323
But you said
that humans hesitate.

656
00:50:01,324 --> 00:50:05,752
Only when there making decisions.
He's not making decisions?

657
00:50:06,393 --> 00:50:08,016
Yes and no.

658
00:50:08,556 --> 00:50:11,211
In his every day life
man rules over machine.

659
00:50:11,237 --> 00:50:12,968
Alex makes his own decisions.

660
00:50:13,709 --> 00:50:17,083
When he engages in battle
the visor comes down

661
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:21,354
and the software takes over
and, uh, the machine does everything.

662
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:24,589
Alex is a passenger,
just along for the ride.

663
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:29,937
But, if the machine
is in control how is

664
00:50:29,963 --> 00:50:32,080
Murphy accountable? Who's
pulling the trigger?

665
00:50:32,081 --> 00:50:36,262
When the machine fights the system
releases signals into Alex's brain.

666
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:38,965
Making him think he's doing what
our computers are actually doing.

667
00:50:38,966 --> 00:50:41,493
I mean, Alex believes right
now he is in control.

668
00:50:41,494 --> 00:50:45,533
But, he's not. It's the
illusion of free will.

669
00:50:55,245 --> 00:50:56,631
Crap.

670
00:51:18,551 --> 00:51:21,680
You circumvented the law by creating
a machine that thinks it's a man.

671
00:51:21,681 --> 00:51:24,158
- But that's illegal.
- No, no.

672
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,981
It is a machine that
think it's Alex Murphy.

673
00:51:27,982 --> 00:51:30,847
And in my book - That's legal.

674
00:51:33,235 --> 00:51:34,550
Well done.

675
00:51:36,168 --> 00:51:37,889
Well done.

676
00:51:40,707 --> 00:51:42,820
Hey Doctor what
happens if I tase an

677
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:45,529
exoskeleton with a little
asshole on the side?

678
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:50,439
I think We're all curious to find out.

679
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,751
Go ahead.

680
00:52:28,668 --> 00:52:31,193
If I had a pulse, it
would be racing.

681
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:33,940
She's been waiting for months.

682
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:36,399
I'm sure hers is too.

683
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:39,972
You're gonna do fine.

684
00:52:49,076 --> 00:52:51,685
I love your sign D.

685
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:56,538
Hey.

686
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,866
There's nothin to be nervous about.

687
00:53:07,274 --> 00:53:10,981
Thank you, Dennett.
It's been a privilege.

688
00:54:45,569 --> 00:54:47,017
Hi, Dad.

689
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:53,691
I missed you, buddy. Me too.

690
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,644
Want to feel it?

691
00:55:06,277 --> 00:55:07,934
What is it?

692
00:55:08,797 --> 00:55:10,295
It's okay, sweety.

693
00:55:22,003 --> 00:55:24,911
Saved all the redwings
games on my computer.

694
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,543
You did?

695
00:55:30,296 --> 00:55:32,268
- How'd they do?
- I don't know.

696
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:34,095
I've been waiting to
watch them with you.

697
00:55:36,097 --> 00:55:37,480
I'd love to kiddo.

698
00:55:37,965 --> 00:55:42,878
But I can't tonight.
Daddy's suit needs some.

699
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:46,543
Special handling.

700
00:55:47,765 --> 00:55:49,606
You understand?

701
00:56:20,497 --> 00:56:23,692
Thanks for coming, Jack.
I heard you went home already.

702
00:56:23,693 --> 00:56:25,634
Clara should be
thrilled to have you back.

703
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,384
I saw Clara.

704
00:56:26,385 --> 00:56:28,790
And David.

705
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,267
That ain't my home right now.

706
00:56:35,293 --> 00:56:39,126
It's in a damn lab across the hall
I'm sorry, Alex.

707
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,113
Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna take
down Vallon and his whole damn crew.

708
00:56:43,114 --> 00:56:45,341
I was waiting to
hear you say that.

709
00:56:49,767 --> 00:56:52,569
At least I know you're
the right color now.

710
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:29,550
Cooler temperatures here today certainly
have not stopped people from showing up.

711
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:32,944
We're expecting people from every
corner of the city here in detroit.

712
00:57:32,945 --> 00:57:36,587
To come out and show their support
for Detective Alex Murphy.

713
00:57:36,588 --> 00:57:40,398
You know, a lot of questions on people's
minds today is "What will he look like?"

714
00:57:40,399 --> 00:57:44,188
"Is he a changed man?"
Rumor has it he is in the building.

715
00:57:44,189 --> 00:57:45,677
Preparing to come out.

716
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:52,009
Alex, We're going to upload the
entire DPD database into your brain.

717
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:56,389
That means you'll have instantaneous
access to criminal records.

718
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:00,373
Plus an archive of CCTV footage
from 2011 to the present.

719
00:58:00,774 --> 00:58:03,629
Alright, Hit me.

720
00:58:04,854 --> 00:58:06,672
Kim, it's all yours.

721
00:58:08,629 --> 00:58:10,908
Archive footage uploading successfully.

722
00:58:10,909 --> 00:58:14,360
You're system draws
connections automatically.

723
00:58:14,361 --> 00:58:16,602
It will link perpetrators
to the crimes and

724
00:58:16,628 --> 00:58:18,970
give you exact locations,
whenever available.

725
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:23,308
I have evidence to make 138
I don't know.

726
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:25,026
166 arrests.

727
00:58:26,353 --> 00:58:28,094
His emotions are stable.

728
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:31,298
This is incredible.

729
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,872
You will notice his family is
here in the building as well.

730
00:58:34,873 --> 00:58:38,167
The mayor is standing on stage
behind me, also Raymond Sellers,

731
00:58:38,168 --> 00:58:40,916
from Omnicorp. They seem
like great friends. Obviously

732
00:58:40,942 --> 00:58:43,281
echoing the partnership
they brought together.

733
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:46,387
How much longer will this take?
Well the

734
00:58:46,413 --> 00:58:48,232
feed from the database
is almost done.

735
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,932
We're approaching present day.

736
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:54,257
634 pending arrests.

737
00:58:54,649 --> 00:58:56,434
We're gonna need a bigger prison.

738
00:58:59,256 --> 00:59:02,387
He's on top of her..
Doctor Norton he's getting to emotional.

739
00:59:02,388 --> 00:59:05,868
I've gotta do something.
Alex, calm down.

740
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,513
Take a breath. Relax.

741
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:13,770
Kim, what are the readings?
I haven't seen them at levels like this.

742
00:59:13,771 --> 00:59:16,996
He's gonna shoot him!
Alex, relax.

743
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:19,858
Relax.

744
00:59:20,246 --> 00:59:22,845
Alex... What is it?

745
00:59:22,846 --> 00:59:26,067
A computer glitch?
No that's his own crime scene.

746
00:59:26,068 --> 00:59:28,628
He's spiking all over the place
Alex!

747
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:30,606
Alex!

748
00:59:30,607 --> 00:59:33,103
The system is crashing Doctor.
Alex, can you hear me?

749
00:59:33,298 --> 00:59:34,654
Alex, Alex.

750
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:36,727
I'm not sure he can handle this.
Do something.

751
00:59:37,129 --> 00:59:39,150
He's emotionally Overload!
Unlock Me!

752
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:42,506
Stop it! Stop it!
He's having a seizure.

753
00:59:42,507 --> 00:59:45,312
Kim, shut it down. Alex!

754
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:47,650
Give me a live feed
I can't do it. Doctor Norton..

755
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:50,070
- Now!
- Jesus Christ!

756
00:59:50,071 --> 00:59:51,937
Dr. Norton? What?

757
00:59:51,973 --> 00:59:54,303
The press is waiting.
We have to get him up there now.

758
00:59:54,337 --> 00:59:57,007
What do you want me to do?
I don't know, fix him.

759
00:59:57,008 --> 00:59:58,226
Do what you have to do.

760
00:59:58,252 --> 01:00:01,376
Your reputation is on the line
every bit as much as ours.

761
01:00:02,822 --> 01:00:04,301
We're running out of time.

762
01:00:05,762 --> 01:00:07,267
Okay.

763
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:10,336
Everybody out.

764
01:00:10,939 --> 01:00:12,328
OUT!

765
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:14,220
Mayor Duran
Is about to take to the stage

766
01:00:14,222 --> 01:00:17,635
and introduce Detroit's newest
weapon in the war on crime.

767
01:00:17,636 --> 01:00:20,625
I'm actually getting word that
he's ready to go right now.

768
01:00:25,232 --> 01:00:27,621
Heart rate rising, he might
start spiking Doctor.

769
01:00:27,622 --> 01:00:30,497
To absorb
dopamine and noradrenaline.

770
01:00:30,498 --> 01:00:33,781
But you'll be taking away his emotions.
Drop the levels until I tell you to stop.

771
01:00:33,782 --> 01:00:36,187
Doctor you'll be taking away
his ability to feel anything.

772
01:00:36,213 --> 01:00:36,875
Now, please.

773
01:00:42,842 --> 01:00:45,332
Hold the footage, put it on a loop.

774
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:49,899
- Dopamine levels 20 %.
- More.

775
01:00:52,637 --> 01:00:55,007
- Dopamine levels 10 %.
- More.

776
01:00:56,274 --> 01:00:57,487
- Dopamine levels 5 %
- Lower.

777
01:00:57,513 --> 01:00:59,696
You're flatting him out. Lower!

778
01:01:02,717 --> 01:01:04,578
2 %. Hold it there.

779
01:01:11,981 --> 01:01:13,282
Alex?

780
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,899
Alex, how do you feel?

781
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:22,313
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

782
01:01:23,816 --> 01:01:28,174
Today, I'm not here to talk
about crime prevention.

783
01:01:29,233 --> 01:01:32,667
I am here to give you the cure.

784
01:01:41,063 --> 01:01:42,725
Hi, Dad.

785
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,122
Dad?

786
01:01:47,932 --> 01:01:49,351
NO DANGER

787
01:01:51,794 --> 01:01:55,707
Ladies and gentlemen,
the revolution begins right now,

788
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:58,754
with Detective Alex Murphy.

789
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:33,658
What's he doing?
He looks like a Zombie.

790
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,777
I think he accessing
Criminal data.

791
01:02:43,814 --> 01:02:45,806
Thomas King!
You're under arrest.

792
01:03:03,553 --> 01:03:06,976
Until today, Thomas King was
a convicted felon

793
01:03:06,977 --> 01:03:10,394
wanted for rape, arson, and murder.

794
01:03:11,195 --> 01:03:14,671
This man has torn apart
American families.

795
01:03:15,411 --> 01:03:18,555
On the loose for 6 years.

796
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:24,526
And where was this criminal
mastermind hiding?

797
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:32,533
Right in front of
the police headquarters.

798
01:03:33,228 --> 01:03:37,256
Here he is just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.

799
01:03:37,842 --> 01:03:41,525
These two officers
are completely unaware

800
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,762
of the monster in their midst.

801
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:50,026
And then, in 60 seconds..

802
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:53,662
I repeat, just 60 seconds.

803
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,577
Detective Murphy brings him down.

804
01:03:57,578 --> 01:04:00,015
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can not afford an attorney.

805
01:04:00,016 --> 01:04:01,631
One will be provided for you.

806
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:07,548
This, my friends, is the
future of American justice.

807
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:12,214
How many like Thomas King
will pay for their crimes now

808
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:15,536
that RoboCop is here.

809
01:04:15,537 --> 01:04:16,888
Yes!

810
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:20,813
Let's not shy away from
what this means people.

811
01:04:21,372 --> 01:04:25,639
Men weren't up to the task.

812
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:30,609
But Alex Murphy,
a robot cop was.

813
01:04:31,979 --> 01:04:35,062
We can't take him off the street.
This is what I'm saying.

814
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:36,891
He's a hit. A big
fat stinking hit.

815
01:04:36,892 --> 01:04:38,984
Until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

816
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:40,976
Hey we all knew there
would be issues.

817
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:45,243
It was inevitable. Dennett You're my guy.
I just need you to get a handle on this.

818
01:04:45,244 --> 01:04:48,847
I need more time. Scientifically,
we're in uncharted water.

819
01:04:48,848 --> 01:04:51,611
We need to take him back to the
lab and do more tests,

820
01:04:51,612 --> 01:04:54,648
It was like, something was
interfering with our system.

821
01:04:54,649 --> 01:04:57,481
Something beyond
chemistry or physics.

822
01:04:57,482 --> 01:04:58,814
Like what? His soul?

823
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,721
Hey look this train
has left the station.

824
01:05:01,722 --> 01:05:04,134
We can't exactly go out
to the world and say.

825
01:05:04,135 --> 01:05:06,846
"Sorry, we released
a defective product."

826
01:05:06,847 --> 01:05:09,845
So no matter what we do, we just
need to keep him on the streets.

827
01:05:09,846 --> 01:05:13,514
What about the interviews?
Cancel them, cancel all of them.

828
01:05:14,138 --> 01:05:17,739
Everything. In fact, Dennett...

829
01:05:18,423 --> 01:05:20,360
Let's uh...

830
01:05:20,361 --> 01:05:22,978
Let's keep the wife at a
distance for now as well.

831
01:05:24,422 --> 01:05:27,817
I would like to see him.
Can you arrange that?

832
01:05:27,818 --> 01:05:29,371
Look, I won't lie to you

833
01:05:30,642 --> 01:05:34,102
Alex was so nervous
we had to sedate him.

834
01:05:34,103 --> 01:05:36,623
I looked in his eyes
and I couldn't see my husband.

835
01:05:36,624 --> 01:05:39,038
And then he just shoots a
man in front of our son.

836
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,340
That's not sedation.

837
01:05:41,911 --> 01:05:44,596
He's responding to
drugs differently now.

838
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:51,829
We both knew from day one there
would be complications.

839
01:05:56,776 --> 01:06:01,160
Just give me a little more time.
I promise...

840
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:04,363
You'll have your husband back.

841
01:06:06,873 --> 01:06:10,449
This goes for every squad
in every department.

842
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:13,993
Detective Murphy will have full
access all investigations.

843
01:06:14,312 --> 01:06:17,342
Robberies, narcotics, homicide.

844
01:06:17,343 --> 01:06:21,761
If he requests to take over a case,
the case will be handed to him.

845
01:06:21,762 --> 01:06:23,481
No arguments, No complaints.

846
01:06:23,482 --> 01:06:26,436
This is Bullshit!
I said "no complaints"!

847
01:06:26,437 --> 01:06:27,897
And I mean it!

848
01:06:29,158 --> 01:06:31,962
Good morning, chief Dean.
Good morning, officers.

849
01:06:31,963 --> 01:06:35,587
I selected 13 targets today, all
wanted for murder.

850
01:06:35,588 --> 01:06:38,932
John Biggs is # 1.
I will be taking over this case.

851
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:43,012
Ambulances detention vehicles and coroners
should be ready to move in on my request.

852
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,348
I wish you all a very good day.

853
01:06:53,163 --> 01:06:54,837
Murphy...

854
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:56,798
You okay man?

855
01:06:56,824 --> 01:06:59,688
I'm fine sargent.

856
01:07:00,398 --> 01:07:03,349
Can't wait to get back to work
Thinkin Daniels is -

857
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:05,654
Excuse me, I have casework.

858
01:07:57,002 --> 01:07:59,174
Don't shoot!

859
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,030
Don't shoot!

860
01:08:06,885 --> 01:08:08,753
Walter Karrel, look at me.

861
01:08:08,754 --> 01:08:14,182
You have two options Option 1:
I shoot you with 50,000 volts.

862
01:08:14,183 --> 01:08:16,311
Which can cause respiratory failure.

863
01:08:16,312 --> 01:08:18,806
Organ malfunction,
internal burns,

864
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:21,892
and loss of bowl and bladder control.
And then, I arrest you.

865
01:08:22,242 --> 01:08:25,679
Option 2: You tell me where
John Biggs drug lab is located.

866
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:28,093
And then I arrest you.

867
01:08:29,101 --> 01:08:31,085
You have two seconds to decide.

868
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:43,786
Totally justifiable.
We are going to make a lot of money.

869
01:09:43,787 --> 01:09:47,905
Nothing. No fear, no increase
heart-rate,

870
01:09:47,906 --> 01:09:50,864
no traces of anger, whatsoever.

871
01:09:51,237 --> 01:09:55,689
Congratulations, Doctor.
You did it.

872
01:09:56,646 --> 01:09:58,076
Yes, I did.

873
01:10:06,256 --> 01:10:10,776
I told you, sir. Norton clearly
never had control of the product.

874
01:10:10,777 --> 01:10:13,549
I agree. And that's why
I called you here.

875
01:10:13,985 --> 01:10:16,848
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.

876
01:10:16,849 --> 01:10:20,484
Okay, I'll need a feed
from the Tin Man's head.

877
01:10:20,485 --> 01:10:22,541
Plus full surveillance of the lab.

878
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:25,228
You're gonna have full
access to everything.

879
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:26,506
If anything comes up

880
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,723
I'll be in Washington.

881
01:10:32,577 --> 01:10:36,401
He brought peace to this
country's most violent city.

882
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,613
He showed us all that
Detroit and America

883
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:41,544
can have a brighter future

884
01:10:41,545 --> 01:10:43,384
a future of economic growth.

885
01:10:43,385 --> 01:10:45,378
Freedom and happiness.

886
01:10:45,379 --> 01:10:49,074
On tonight's show, a
visionary and true patriot.

887
01:10:49,075 --> 01:10:53,726
The CEO of Omnicorp,
Raymond Sellers.

888
01:10:55,322 --> 01:10:56,379
Hello, Pat - Raymond.

889
01:10:56,405 --> 01:10:57,714
Thanks for having me.

890
01:10:57,715 --> 01:11:00,717
You must be doing a
victory lap about now.

891
01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:05,017
Two weeks ago, Omni stock
went through the roof.

892
01:11:05,383 --> 01:11:10,178
And the Senate finally agreed to vote
on the repeal of the Dreyfuss act.

893
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,201
Well, look, I mean the tide
is definitely turning.

894
01:11:13,695 --> 01:11:16,654
I just feel certain that soon we'll
be keeping all Americans safe.

895
01:11:16,655 --> 01:11:21,356
I certainly hope so. But I think our next
guest will have a different point of view.

896
01:11:22,116 --> 01:11:26,011
Hubert Dreyfuss. Senator,
thank you for attending.

897
01:11:26,012 --> 01:11:27,895
Hello, Pat. Mr. Sellers.

898
01:11:27,896 --> 01:11:30,273
Senator, do you know what this is?

899
01:11:30,274 --> 01:11:34,199
The American public is
divided on the Dreyfuss act.

900
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:38,603
Our polls at Novakelement.com are tight.

901
01:11:38,604 --> 01:11:39,904
50 % to 50 %.

902
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:43,770
There is no doubt Omnicorp
created a sensation,

903
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:47,459
But this bill is not
about Alex Murphy.

904
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,873
It's about weather America's
willing to give robots

905
01:11:49,874 --> 01:11:51,770
the authority over human lives.

906
01:11:51,771 --> 01:11:54,154
Look.

907
01:11:54,155 --> 01:11:57,560
This uh C-change we're witnessing.
And it is a C-change.

908
01:11:57,561 --> 01:12:00,919
Shows that Americans don't really
care if our law enforcement systems

909
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:05,695
manned or unmanned. What they care about
is efficiency, and they care about safety.

910
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,093
You're clouding the issue.

911
01:12:07,094 --> 01:12:11,699
This is clearly an attempt to sway
public opinion with a marketing stunt.

912
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,894
What's clear is, with
just one system in place.

913
01:12:14,895 --> 01:12:18,738
We've cut crime by 80 %.
Just Imagine if we put...

914
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:20,860
I don't know, lets say
100 systems in place.

915
01:12:20,861 --> 01:12:24,456
And then I want you to ask yourself.
Why are you holding us back?

916
01:12:24,457 --> 01:12:26,055
Is that your pla-
Thank you, Senator.

917
01:12:26,056 --> 01:12:28,142
And thank you, Raymond.
Thank you, Pat.

918
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:31,216
Well, there you have it.

919
01:12:31,217 --> 01:12:35,148
Who could argue with that?
Which begs the question.

920
01:12:36,029 --> 01:12:40,885
Has the US Senate become Pro-Crime?

921
01:12:50,226 --> 01:12:52,949
Yeah Hi No. 5000.

922
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:55,497
Call me tomorrow.

923
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:00,282
Hey guys. Vallons
waiting for you inside.

924
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,341
What, you're too busy to walk us in?
I'm out here making money.

925
01:13:04,342 --> 01:13:07,041
Where are my trip wires?
I gotta do this myself?

926
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:11,042
- What took you so long?
- What the hell is all this shit?

927
01:13:11,043 --> 01:13:13,368
I can't move any product with
this thing on the streets.

928
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:15,893
What are you doing
to protect me?

929
01:13:15,894 --> 01:13:19,977
- Relax, the guys a walking zombie.
- Tell me your phones are off.

930
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:22,299
He's not going after you,
we've covered our tracks.

931
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,969
Can't manufacture
evidence out of thin air.

932
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:26,396
If he does, I'm ready for him.

933
01:13:34,698 --> 01:13:36,000
Well?

934
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:42,189
I've been getting calls.
From whom?

935
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:48,160
Clara. We need to let her
see her husband. She has rights.

936
01:13:49,194 --> 01:13:51,773
That's not your decision.
That's legal's call.

937
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:55,979
But it is only a question of time
until she turns up on television.

938
01:13:56,941 --> 01:13:58,919
She can try.

939
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,593
I'll issue a gag order before
I'll let her see her husband.

940
01:14:03,124 --> 01:14:04,987
I'd hop to it.

941
01:14:06,328 --> 01:14:08,502
Alex. Alex!

942
01:14:10,365 --> 01:14:11,959
Alex.

943
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,823
You need to come home.
Clara, please stand aside.

944
01:14:14,824 --> 01:14:16,299
Need to speak to your son.

945
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,673
Right now I see 3
crimes in progress.

946
01:14:18,674 --> 01:14:20,111
Alex, listen to me.

947
01:14:21,489 --> 01:14:22,800
I know your in there.

948
01:14:24,925 --> 01:14:26,717
David won't show his face at school.

949
01:14:27,698 --> 01:14:29,697
He's having nightmares.

950
01:14:31,043 --> 01:14:33,848
He's falling apart
I'm falling apart.

951
01:14:35,316 --> 01:14:36,617
Please...

952
01:14:38,084 --> 01:14:40,496
I can't do this on my own.

953
01:14:40,497 --> 01:14:43,912
He's been scared ever
since that night.

954
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:57,145
What do you think she's gonna do?
What's he gonna do?

955
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:20,731
You Okay? David?

956
01:15:45,568 --> 01:15:47,569
He's supposed to be watching this.

957
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:51,383
Instead, he's accessing
images of Clara and David

958
01:15:51,384 --> 01:15:53,716
arriving at school
over and over again.

959
01:15:53,717 --> 01:15:58,195
Somehow he's overriding
the system's priorities.

960
01:16:08,613 --> 01:16:10,868
You want me to shut him down?
No.

961
01:16:10,869 --> 01:16:12,451
Not yet.

962
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:15,667
I want to see what happens.

963
01:16:35,613 --> 01:16:37,424
What's he doing at his house?

964
01:16:39,991 --> 01:16:43,134
Look, He's disobeying protocol.
You have to shut him down.

965
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,996
As far as I can tell he's
still doing his job.

966
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,411
Adrian, give me
an image of his brain.

967
01:17:50,233 --> 01:17:52,886
He's undoing what we did to him.

968
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:56,078
His Dopamine levels it
are coming back to normal.

969
01:17:56,079 --> 01:18:01,518
How is that even possible?
I haven't the faintest idea.

970
01:18:02,622 --> 01:18:04,039
Alex?

971
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:32,374
Alex, please
return to the station.

972
01:18:33,637 --> 01:18:35,379
I want to run some tests.

973
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,592
Well this should be interesting.

974
01:18:55,947 --> 01:18:58,680
We're not cops alright, we
work for Antoine Vallon!

975
01:18:59,758 --> 01:19:01,059
What did you say?

976
01:19:01,968 --> 01:19:03,611
We work for Antoine Vallon.

977
01:19:32,311 --> 01:19:33,823
My hand, man!

978
01:19:33,824 --> 01:19:36,280
Where is Antoine Vallon?
You broke my hand man!

979
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:38,900
I know you remember me, Jerry.

980
01:19:43,066 --> 01:19:44,894
Where's Vallon? Wait!

981
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,822
If I tell you where Vallon is
he'll kill my wife and kid man.

982
01:19:49,397 --> 01:19:52,788
Your wife left you in 2019 after filing
charges on you for domestic abuse.

983
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:54,465
And you don't have a kid.

984
01:19:55,536 --> 01:19:57,211
But I do.

985
01:19:58,052 --> 01:19:59,505
I'm not asking again!

986
01:19:59,506 --> 01:20:01,809
Look, I swear man, I don't
know where Vallon is okay?

987
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,869
The only guy I talk to
is his driver Marcus.

988
01:20:03,895 --> 01:20:05,038
That's it man that's it!

989
01:20:05,763 --> 01:20:07,284
Does he have a phone number?

990
01:20:23,509 --> 01:20:26,400
We have a problem.
Alex is breaking protocol.

991
01:20:26,435 --> 01:20:28,355
What's he doing?

992
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:30,584
He's off solving his own murder.

993
01:20:30,585 --> 01:20:35,188
That is genius. Why
didn't I think of that?

994
01:20:42,195 --> 01:20:44,096
How long until he gets here?

995
01:20:44,097 --> 01:20:46,042
5 minutes.- Alright.

996
01:20:46,499 --> 01:20:48,300
Johnny, you stay
on these monitors.

997
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:49,602
What happened?

998
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:53,655
Some idiot used an
unencrypted phone.

999
01:20:54,805 --> 01:20:56,207
Shit!

1000
01:21:04,214 --> 01:21:05,816
Alright, everyone listen up!

1001
01:21:06,417 --> 01:21:07,818
He's coming.

1002
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:10,820
If he leaves alive, you don't!

1003
01:21:11,621 --> 01:21:13,272
How do we stop him?

1004
01:21:14,623 --> 01:21:18,226
With 50 caliber and above.
Aim for the head.

1005
01:21:29,837 --> 01:21:31,238
This one's set.

1006
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:33,140
Go! Go!

1007
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:34,642
Run!

1008
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:37,043
Come on!

1009
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:40,947
Ready to go!

1010
01:21:41,648 --> 01:21:43,149
They're all set.

1011
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:12,178
Finish it!

1012
01:23:26,641 --> 01:23:27,943
Free shot!

1013
01:24:16,107 --> 01:24:18,887
Watch out.

1014
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:22,791
Need me to call a doctor?
Come on Jack you're gonna like this.

1015
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,760
What's going on?
What the hell you doin here?

1016
01:24:25,785 --> 01:24:27,997
Y'all gonna play
good cop bad cop?

1017
01:24:27,998 --> 01:24:30,350
No, Daniels. Bad cop, RoboCop

1018
01:24:32,008 --> 01:24:35,553
I've recovered 26 guns
from Vallon's warehouse

1019
01:24:35,554 --> 01:24:37,604
13 serial numbers match

1020
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:40,559
weapons missing from evidence, and
I got your prints all over them.

1021
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,309
- This is bullshit!
- I also..

1022
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:45,311
I also have CCTV footage of
you and Vallon the same day

1023
01:24:45,312 --> 01:24:46,814
he tried to kill me.

1024
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:48,316
Why don't we talk about this?

1025
01:24:48,317 --> 01:24:51,817
It won't work, now that his partners
hit he's not gonna let it go.

1026
01:24:51,818 --> 01:24:53,319
His hospital.

1027
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,320
Murphy's dropping by this afternoon.

1028
01:24:55,321 --> 01:24:57,395
If I kill a cop I'm looking
over my shoulder..

1029
01:24:57,421 --> 01:24:59,424
You know what they do
to cops in prison man?

1030
01:24:59,425 --> 01:25:03,429
You get locked up with the
same doods you put in there.

1031
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:08,883
Think before he gives you up.

1032
01:25:11,876 --> 01:25:13,837
Don't shoot me.

1033
01:25:15,338 --> 01:25:18,140
I swear to Christ it was dean.

1034
01:25:18,141 --> 01:25:21,194
He helped pull those guns.
Just don't shoot me.

1035
01:25:23,445 --> 01:25:25,447
Thank you for your cooperation.

1036
01:25:27,349 --> 01:25:29,051
You can cuff him now, Jack.

1037
01:25:37,579 --> 01:25:40,360
Now I know why we
couldn't get an arrest.

1038
01:25:41,335 --> 01:25:43,239
Vallon was protected
from up on high.

1039
01:25:43,266 --> 01:25:45,265
Alex, I can explain.

1040
01:25:45,966 --> 01:25:48,318
- You tipped him off today.
- Come on, man don't do this.

1041
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:49,969
You tried to kill me twice!

1042
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:54,173
I trusted you, and you
destroyed my family.

1043
01:25:54,673 --> 01:25:55,983
Confess. Now

1044
01:25:56,675 --> 01:25:58,277
in front of everyone.

1045
01:25:58,278 --> 01:25:59,779
Confess!

1046
01:26:09,387 --> 01:26:11,689
What happened? Tin man is down.

1047
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:13,591
Had to be done. Why?

1048
01:26:13,592 --> 01:26:15,195
Product shot a corrupt cop.

1049
01:26:15,196 --> 01:26:17,092
2 more seconds the Chief's
brains would have

1050
01:26:17,118 --> 01:26:18,970
been splattered across
the 6 O'clock news.

1051
01:26:19,596 --> 01:26:20,896
We got anything on her?

1052
01:26:20,897 --> 01:26:23,899
No, she's Chief of
the Detroit Police Department.

1053
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,401
What do you think?

1054
01:26:28,903 --> 01:26:30,305
You know what?

1055
01:26:31,606 --> 01:26:34,809
This might actually tip this
thing right into the net.

1056
01:26:41,415 --> 01:26:44,518
Alex, I don't know
if you can hear me

1057
01:26:44,519 --> 01:26:48,271
but tonight you uncovered
a nest of vipers,

1058
01:26:48,272 --> 01:26:50,524
Inside the Detroit Police Department.

1059
01:26:50,525 --> 01:26:54,927
And in so doing, you shed
light on an invaluable truth.

1060
01:26:55,728 --> 01:26:57,229
Even the police,

1061
01:26:57,230 --> 01:27:01,482
the men and women
sworn to keep us safe,

1062
01:27:01,483 --> 01:27:03,934
they can be bribed.

1063
01:27:03,935 --> 01:27:07,438
They can be bought.

1064
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:13,243
Machines, however,
are corruption free.

1065
01:27:13,794 --> 01:27:17,147
Americans could be living in a
country where law enforcement

1066
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:19,249
is not only efficient,

1067
01:27:19,749 --> 01:27:21,351
but incorruptible.

1068
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:24,854
Thank you Alex for all you've done.

1069
01:27:24,855 --> 01:27:26,857
And for all that you are.

1070
01:27:27,356 --> 01:27:30,559
Detective Murphy is currently
in critical condition.

1071
01:27:31,059 --> 01:27:33,961
Our Doctors are working ceaselessly.

1072
01:27:33,962 --> 01:27:36,816
But this time, it is unclear
if he will survive.

1073
01:27:37,365 --> 01:27:40,167
Mrs. Klein how do you think
the attempt on Detective

1074
01:27:40,168 --> 01:27:44,622
Alex Murphy's life will effect
tomorrow's vote for the Dreyfuss act?

1075
01:27:44,623 --> 01:27:46,473
At this time Omnicorp's soul concern is.

1076
01:27:46,474 --> 01:27:48,727
The full recovery of
Detective Alex Murphy.

1077
01:27:49,675 --> 01:27:54,080
How many times does Detective Murphy
have to give his life for his country?

1078
01:27:54,605 --> 01:27:58,584
I sincerely hope
the Senate makes the right vote

1079
01:27:58,585 --> 01:28:02,288
so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices.

1080
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:04,690
Will not have been in vain.

1081
01:28:09,293 --> 01:28:11,295
Senator Dreyfuss is my friend

1082
01:28:11,296 --> 01:28:16,423
he has been my mentor and my strength
in times of difficulty on this floor.

1083
01:28:17,351 --> 01:28:19,954
But despite all that, I
work for the state of Ohio

1084
01:28:19,955 --> 01:28:23,506
and the safety of It's
citizens is my top priority.

1085
01:28:24,006 --> 01:28:27,209
So, I vote yes. The Dreyfuss
act must be repealed.

1086
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:30,312
That's us ahead 39 to 10

1087
01:28:30,313 --> 01:28:31,965
I spoke to the senate liaison.

1088
01:28:31,966 --> 01:28:34,469
It looks like it's in the bag,
but we still have to tred

1089
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:35,971
carefully with the politicians.

1090
01:28:37,175 --> 01:28:40,276
We're here live at DPD headquarters.

1091
01:28:40,277 --> 01:28:42,379
Where moments ago Clara Murphy

1092
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,224
made a shocking statement.

1093
01:28:44,225 --> 01:28:47,427
Omnicorp as denied me and my son

1094
01:28:47,428 --> 01:28:49,181
access to Alex for weeks.

1095
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:51,983
I demand to know why.

1096
01:28:53,033 --> 01:28:55,034
This treatment is inhumane

1097
01:28:55,035 --> 01:28:58,038
and someone has to be
held accountable.

1098
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,841
We're fucked.

1099
01:29:00,842 --> 01:29:04,042
No, you only need 12 votes.
She shouldn't make much difference.

1100
01:29:04,043 --> 01:29:05,745
What about after the vote?

1101
01:29:05,746 --> 01:29:10,548
Those two should not be aloud contact. If
she starts putting ideas in his head..

1102
01:29:10,549 --> 01:29:13,851
Bring her in. I'll
handle the explanation.

1103
01:29:13,852 --> 01:29:18,255
What about Alex? Unfortunately
we can't just keep him on ice.

1104
01:29:18,256 --> 01:29:20,857
The shooting at the station
spooked some of the politicians.

1105
01:29:20,858 --> 01:29:23,461
They're our clients we
have to take care of them.

1106
01:29:23,462 --> 01:29:26,061
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate

1107
01:29:26,062 --> 01:29:29,266
when a man is
investigating city politics

1108
01:29:29,267 --> 01:29:30,567
they get nervous.

1109
01:29:30,568 --> 01:29:33,068
Alright.
First, it's not a man okay?

1110
01:29:33,069 --> 01:29:34,771
It's property of Omnicorp.

1111
01:29:34,772 --> 01:29:37,273
And politicians are the
least of your concern.

1112
01:29:37,274 --> 01:29:39,178
I mean this thing
solved it's own murder.

1113
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:41,832
How long until it realizes you
haven't been on the level with it.

1114
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:44,569
If that happens,
every journalist in this country

1115
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:47,381
is dying to speak with him
I mean We created a hero.

1116
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:50,885
What happens
when he opens his mouth?

1117
01:29:54,388 --> 01:29:56,291
What's bigger then a hero?

1118
01:30:07,899 --> 01:30:09,400
A dead hero.

1119
01:30:13,605 --> 01:30:15,306
Get me Doctor Norton.

1120
01:30:24,315 --> 01:30:26,015
What is this, Raymond?

1121
01:30:26,716 --> 01:30:28,418
You have Mattox spying on me

1122
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:30,720
and now this bullshit about
critical condition?

1123
01:30:30,721 --> 01:30:33,923
You and I know
that Alex is fine!

1124
01:30:33,924 --> 01:30:36,125
Calm down, Dennett.

1125
01:30:36,126 --> 01:30:39,527
- Your work is so good that...
- It is not my work!

1126
01:30:39,528 --> 01:30:41,729
You saw the woman on TV!

1127
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:43,432
This has to stop!

1128
01:30:45,432 --> 01:30:49,338
You're right, but
Let me ask you something.

1129
01:30:49,339 --> 01:30:52,242
What kind of life have we
really given Alex Murphy?

1130
01:30:52,243 --> 01:30:55,842
He's never going to be a normal man,
a father, a husband.

1131
01:30:55,843 --> 01:30:59,946
By the time we put the other units on
the street he's just Dennett...

1132
01:31:02,148 --> 01:31:05,651
Face it. We failed him.

1133
01:31:07,502 --> 01:31:09,454
We failed Alex Murphy.

1134
01:31:09,455 --> 01:31:11,325
But I want you to think
about the bigger picture.

1135
01:31:11,351 --> 01:31:12,858
Because that's what
we're talking about.

1136
01:31:12,859 --> 01:31:15,861
The work you've done with him is
going to be studied for decades.

1137
01:31:15,862 --> 01:31:18,012
You've changed the face of history Dennett.

1138
01:31:18,013 --> 01:31:22,566
No Policeman is ever going to
die in the line of duty again.

1139
01:31:22,567 --> 01:31:24,268
Because of you.

1140
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:27,872
Think about that!

1141
01:31:36,078 --> 01:31:40,182
I want that family
taken care of.

1142
01:31:40,183 --> 01:31:42,784
Beyond their wildest dreams.
We owe them that.

1143
01:31:42,785 --> 01:31:44,384
I agree.

1144
01:31:44,385 --> 01:31:47,438
I want full funding. 10 years.

1145
01:31:48,188 --> 01:31:50,290
New staff. All my own people.

1146
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:53,895
Fantastic. Deal!

1147
01:32:04,203 --> 01:32:06,305
Hey, what's going on?
Security's here their

1148
01:32:06,306 --> 01:32:07,607
clearing everyone out.

1149
01:32:07,608 --> 01:32:11,409
Their not waking him up. What ever
you do don't leave him alone.

1150
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:13,378
What do you mean their not waking him up?

1151
01:32:14,515 --> 01:32:18,416
The voting period has ended.
The clerks have tabulated the results.

1152
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:23,020
The yeas are 63
The neighs are 22.

1153
01:32:23,721 --> 01:32:26,124
The majority of senators have
voted in the affirmative.

1154
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:29,925
The Dreyfuss act has been
repealed by congress.

1155
01:32:34,872 --> 01:32:38,434
God, you guys are slow.
Like a bunch of girls.

1156
01:32:38,435 --> 01:32:40,720
This is Mattox.
Dennetts on board.

1157
01:32:40,747 --> 01:32:42,240
It's about time.

1158
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:49,147
Call it.

1159
01:32:49,148 --> 01:32:50,650
Get it done.

1160
01:32:51,429 --> 01:32:53,421
My pleasure.

1161
01:33:01,572 --> 01:33:02,229
Mrs. Murphy.

1162
01:33:02,255 --> 01:33:04,407
You can come here as much as you want

1163
01:33:04,408 --> 01:33:07,660
you can threaten me, you can
sue me, you can take my home

1164
01:33:07,661 --> 01:33:09,757
but I'm not going to stop
until I see my husband.

1165
01:33:09,783 --> 01:33:10,763
Do you understand that?

1166
01:33:10,764 --> 01:33:13,166
Mr. Sellers would very
much like to see you.

1167
01:33:15,046 --> 01:33:15,690
Is Alex okay?

1168
01:33:15,716 --> 01:33:18,069
He has important information
to share with you.

1169
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:20,272
Will you accompany me?

1170
01:33:22,473 --> 01:33:23,976
David...

1171
01:33:25,339 --> 01:33:27,695
We gotta go, can you
grab your coat?

1172
01:33:29,121 --> 01:33:29,830
Hey!

1173
01:33:29,856 --> 01:33:32,267
I'm in the elevator on my way down.
I need access to the lab.

1174
01:33:32,287 --> 01:33:34,586
That's insane, they're still here.

1175
01:33:34,587 --> 01:33:36,389
Distract them.

1176
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:37,691
Okay.

1177
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:41,909
- I can not...
- There's a lady in here going hysterical.

1178
01:33:41,936 --> 01:33:44,072
She will not let us in,
she's got the codes for the door.

1179
01:33:44,099 --> 01:33:46,001
I repeat she will not let us in.

1180
01:33:46,002 --> 01:33:48,179
Lady, you need to let us in there now.
We have to get in there.

1181
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:49,967
Are you not understanding what I'm saying?

1182
01:33:49,968 --> 01:33:53,071
Do you want to be responsible for the
death of everyone in this building?

1183
01:33:53,072 --> 01:33:54,573
Hey! Stop!

1184
01:33:58,088 --> 01:34:00,540
- Don't shoot!
- Step outside.

1185
01:34:06,565 --> 01:34:09,615
Unlock the transmitter!

1186
01:34:10,617 --> 01:34:12,317
Transmitter unlocked.

1187
01:34:18,513 --> 01:34:22,326
Send in Mrs. Murphy please.
Right away sir.

1188
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:26,139
Wake him up

1189
01:34:26,531 --> 01:34:29,233
Alex!

1190
01:34:29,506 --> 01:34:32,836
Alex, it's Doctor Norton.
You have to wake up!

1191
01:34:32,837 --> 01:34:34,639
Alex, can you hear me?

1192
01:34:35,756 --> 01:34:37,157
These men are here to kill us!

1193
01:34:37,341 --> 01:34:39,942
They're here to kill
us for Christ sakes!

1194
01:34:44,847 --> 01:34:48,169
Ms. Murphy, last night,
Alex had a psychotic break.

1195
01:34:48,170 --> 01:34:50,802
He killed an unarmed colleague

1196
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,354
later suffered a seizure.

1197
01:34:54,205 --> 01:34:57,758
We did everything,
everything, we could

1198
01:34:57,759 --> 01:34:59,560
but the doctors couldn't save him.

1199
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,164
Very sorry Mrs Murphy.

1200
01:35:02,165 --> 01:35:04,967
We're going to be making
the announcement shortly.

1201
01:35:05,615 --> 01:35:08,217
You shut me down.
I was about to get a confession.

1202
01:35:08,618 --> 01:35:10,369
Mattox shut you down.

1203
01:35:11,141 --> 01:35:14,473
I removed your transmitter
so that he wouldn't do it again.

1204
01:35:14,873 --> 01:35:17,075
Sellers can not afford to wake you up.

1205
01:35:17,876 --> 01:35:20,677
He sent these guys to pull the plug.

1206
01:35:20,678 --> 01:35:24,031
He wants you dead Alex.
You understand?

1207
01:35:24,382 --> 01:35:27,884
Sorry, if there is anything we can
do for you and David, we'll do it.

1208
01:35:27,885 --> 01:35:29,587
I want nothing from you.

1209
01:35:30,989 --> 01:35:32,388
I Understand.

1210
01:35:32,789 --> 01:35:35,192
You stay out of our lives.

1211
01:35:36,392 --> 01:35:39,795
- You and your company.
- If that's what you think is best.

1212
01:35:40,797 --> 01:35:43,999
There's one more thing, I think it
will be to the benefit of everyone

1213
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,402
especially David,
if we kept this matter private.

1214
01:35:47,403 --> 01:35:50,205
We don't want to
damage Alex's legacy.

1215
01:35:53,108 --> 01:35:55,010
Alex... Alex

1216
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:56,713
Alex I can fix this.

1217
01:35:56,714 --> 01:35:59,914
You lied to me
You lied to my wife.

1218
01:35:59,915 --> 01:36:01,532
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me?

1219
01:36:01,558 --> 01:36:02,468
You want me to trust you Doctor?

1220
01:36:02,469 --> 01:36:04,617
Alex I can go to the press!

1221
01:36:06,269 --> 01:36:08,871
Alex, I can tell them the whole story!

1222
01:36:08,872 --> 01:36:10,374
Alex!

1223
01:36:11,274 --> 01:36:12,875
Listen to me, please!

1224
01:36:13,826 --> 01:36:16,428
Alex! Alex!

1225
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,591
What the hell?

1226
01:36:38,412 --> 01:36:41,951
Give all of our systems a green light. For
Christ sakes get Sellers on the phone.

1227
01:36:42,351 --> 01:36:45,055
Roger that Damn, Damn, Damn...

1228
01:36:46,354 --> 01:36:48,056
Look at this city.

1229
01:36:49,758 --> 01:36:51,460
So beautiful.

1230
01:36:52,361 --> 01:36:55,262
It's become so peaceful.

1231
01:36:57,865 --> 01:37:02,469
I wish I had good news
for Detroit.

1232
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:04,671
I have very sad news.

1233
01:37:04,672 --> 01:37:07,473
Despite our best
efforts to save him.

1234
01:37:07,924 --> 01:37:10,476
Alex Murphy passed
away just hours ago.

1235
01:37:10,477 --> 01:37:12,778
- Alex Murphy...
- Mr. Sellers.

1236
01:37:13,278 --> 01:37:15,531
What is it? Mattox just called.

1237
01:37:15,532 --> 01:37:17,734
We need you to come with us now.

1238
01:37:23,289 --> 01:37:25,060
Ma'am, I need you to
turn around and go the

1239
01:37:25,086 --> 01:37:26,690
other way please -What
are you talking about?

1240
01:37:26,691 --> 01:37:29,693
We've got a security situation here. I need
you to turn around and go the other way.

1241
01:37:29,694 --> 01:37:32,896
Sir, there is a car outside...
That area is locked down, now go!

1242
01:37:32,897 --> 01:37:34,698
- What's happening?
- I said go!

1243
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:37,101
I want to talk to Mr. Sellers.

1244
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,705
- Mr. Sellers.
- How close is the helicopter?

1245
01:37:42,706 --> 01:37:44,307
About 10 minutes sir.

1246
01:38:01,221 --> 01:38:02,622
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1247
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,926
I need to speak with
with Sergeant Jack Lewis.

1248
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:06,428
It's an emergency.

1249
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:10,601
Stand by. Mr. Sellers, apparently
there is a Clara Murphy in the lobby.

1250
01:38:10,631 --> 01:38:11,932
- What?
- Raymond...

1251
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:15,034
If she sees him we are dead in the water.
What do you want to do?

1252
01:38:15,035 --> 01:38:17,387
Bring Ms. Murphy up here.
Yes, sir.

1253
01:38:20,904 --> 01:38:24,342
Norton said that they may be
using drones for protection.

1254
01:38:24,343 --> 01:38:26,544
So, what ever you do, do
not draw your weapons.

1255
01:38:26,545 --> 01:38:28,546
They won't shoot if we're unarmed.

1256
01:38:28,547 --> 01:38:30,199
Clear? Clear!

1257
01:38:46,562 --> 01:38:48,064
Hold it right there!

1258
01:38:49,365 --> 01:38:50,766
Don't move!

1259
01:38:52,868 --> 01:38:54,920
This is private property!

1260
01:38:54,921 --> 01:38:57,372
You are not authorized
to be here!

1261
01:39:01,325 --> 01:39:03,477
I would put those guns
down now if I were you.

1262
01:39:03,478 --> 01:39:05,379
Stand down, stand down.
Alright, okay..

1263
01:39:51,621 --> 01:39:53,321
Head to the lower level!

1264
01:39:54,623 --> 01:39:57,325
- Hold up! Hold up!
- Ram it!

1265
01:40:57,183 --> 01:40:58,810
Gun it!

1266
01:40:59,424 --> 01:41:01,283
Go, go, go!

1267
01:41:17,599 --> 01:41:19,010
Alex, run!

1268
01:41:20,085 --> 01:41:22,546
Omnicorp security!
Drop your weapons!

1269
01:41:22,547 --> 01:41:24,147
Drop your weapons.

1270
01:41:24,148 --> 01:41:27,803
Keep your hands on your head
and no one will be harmed.

1271
01:41:42,379 --> 01:41:43,081
What's going on?

1272
01:41:43,107 --> 01:41:45,298
Mrs Murphy I want you to
listen to me carefully.

1273
01:41:45,627 --> 01:41:48,606
The organic part of your
husband, Alex, is dead.

1274
01:41:48,607 --> 01:41:50,860
The robotic part of him
is malfunctioning.

1275
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:52,821
And he's shooting at the building.
So we gotta

1276
01:41:52,847 --> 01:41:54,618
get you and your son out
of here right away.

1277
01:41:54,619 --> 01:41:56,020
I gotta take this call.

1278
01:41:57,198 --> 01:41:59,272
He just left the lobby.
He's headed our way.

1279
01:41:59,273 --> 01:42:00,674
Roger that Sir.

1280
01:42:01,188 --> 01:42:04,683
Don't shoot my robot, you just flank.
Got it.

1281
01:42:04,684 --> 01:42:06,197
Tin Man.

1282
01:42:08,255 --> 01:42:09,973
Tin Man!

1283
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:12,020
Tin Man!

1284
01:42:12,336 --> 01:42:13,737
There it is.

1285
01:42:14,344 --> 01:42:15,745
You look like crap.

1286
01:42:18,253 --> 01:42:20,675
What's the matter? Can't shoot?

1287
01:42:23,894 --> 01:42:26,280
What were you thinking?
This isn't a drill.

1288
01:42:26,281 --> 01:42:29,385
You're a robot.
I am a Red asset.

1289
01:42:29,386 --> 01:42:30,865
I wrote that myself.

1290
01:42:30,866 --> 01:42:32,213
What do you think?

1291
01:42:32,214 --> 01:42:34,830
Come on Tin Man
just pull the trigger.

1292
01:42:34,955 --> 01:42:36,701
Pull it.

1293
01:42:36,819 --> 01:42:40,011
You can run. Go on.

1294
01:42:40,012 --> 01:42:41,812
Run!

1295
01:42:41,813 --> 01:42:43,345
Run.

1296
01:42:43,346 --> 01:42:44,780
There you go Run!

1297
01:42:45,302 --> 01:42:47,011
Run! Run!

1298
01:42:51,357 --> 01:42:53,209
Stings like a bitch, don't' it?

1299
01:42:53,579 --> 01:42:56,541
Lucky, lucky, I didn't
have my gun set to kill.

1300
01:42:58,357 --> 01:43:01,292
Listen, this isn't personal.

1301
01:43:02,537 --> 01:43:05,623
Well, Maybe a little.

1302
01:43:06,068 --> 01:43:08,036
I'm gonna put you out of your misery.

1303
01:43:19,594 --> 01:43:22,483
Helicopters approaching
Mr. Sellers boards first.

1304
01:43:22,771 --> 01:43:25,872
No, no. Mrs. Murphy.
You and your son can get on first.

1305
01:43:31,368 --> 01:43:34,766
Officer down, mechanical
room, Omnicorp Building.

1306
01:43:34,767 --> 01:43:36,746
Roger that, EMS on the way.

1307
01:43:38,513 --> 01:43:41,407
You're going to be okay Jack.
Non fatal.

1308
01:43:41,849 --> 01:43:43,880
Go, go!

1309
01:43:44,845 --> 01:43:47,391
Omni LZ - Helot-1 on approach to deck.

1310
01:43:54,201 --> 01:43:55,602
What's that?

1311
01:43:56,387 --> 01:43:58,182
He's got a gun! What?

1312
01:43:58,201 --> 01:43:59,898
Pull up! Pull up!

1313
01:44:04,166 --> 01:44:06,880
What the hell is he doing?
Sorry, sir, I don't know.

1314
01:44:12,395 --> 01:44:13,911
- Alex?
- Dad?

1315
01:44:17,922 --> 01:44:19,323
Clara, David...

1316
01:44:20,469 --> 01:44:22,476
Wait...

1317
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:25,635
Get out of the way.
Alex put down the gun.

1318
01:44:25,636 --> 01:44:27,954
Clara, take David
and get out of the way now!

1319
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:33,114
Raymond Sellers, you're under arrest for
the attempted murder of a police officer.

1320
01:44:36,267 --> 01:44:39,009
You're here to cuff me? Alright.

1321
01:44:39,557 --> 01:44:41,175
Go ahead. Cuff me.

1322
01:44:42,218 --> 01:44:45,262
You can't, you're not programmed that way.

1323
01:44:45,263 --> 01:44:48,332
If you go against the program
the entire system shuts down.

1324
01:44:48,379 --> 01:44:50,739
You don't even have a warrant.
We'll overlook this little...

1325
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:53,060
Get down on the ground and put
your hands behind your back.

1326
01:44:53,242 --> 01:44:54,957
- I'm just from marketing.
- NOW!

1327
01:44:54,958 --> 01:44:56,596
Okay, Yep, yep yep yep...

1328
01:44:56,597 --> 01:44:59,002
Alex, we need work together.

1329
01:44:59,003 --> 01:45:02,507
Because I'm the one with the
technology to keep you alive.

1330
01:45:03,242 --> 01:45:05,340
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

1331
01:45:10,211 --> 01:45:11,612
Right.

1332
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,412
Weapon

1333
01:45:14,323 --> 01:45:17,819
Alex, honestly, I
mean you no harm.

1334
01:45:17,872 --> 01:45:20,387
If I wanted to I could have
killed you along time ago.

1335
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:22,333
I just aim this right at
your head and blow it off.

1336
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:24,175
Sellers, please Don't!

1337
01:45:24,202 --> 01:45:27,262
I mean if I wanted to, I could just
aim this at your little family.

1338
01:45:27,953 --> 01:45:29,264
And I could just kill them too.

1339
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:32,462
And really there's nothing you
can do about it because lets face it.

1340
01:45:33,455 --> 01:45:36,252
You're a robot.

1341
01:45:36,364 --> 01:45:37,795
You understand that?

1342
01:45:42,273 --> 01:45:44,273
Alex.

1343
01:45:46,068 --> 01:45:47,726
Dad!

1344
01:45:58,118 --> 01:46:00,118
Hey,

1345
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:05,216
Everything's gonna be alright.

1346
01:46:05,505 --> 01:46:07,341
Everything's gonna be alright.

1347
01:46:57,850 --> 01:46:59,701
How you feeling, Alex?

1348
01:47:01,223 --> 01:47:02,666
I'm ready.

1349
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:41,946
He's ready.

1350
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:20,210
There's still no word from
Omnicorp parent company OCP.

1351
01:48:20,824 --> 01:48:24,514
And although the government says
they are rebuilding Alex Murphy.

1352
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:27,519
Rumors continue to swirly
about his condition.

1353
01:48:27,648 --> 01:48:31,960
But we have obtained exclusive
video taken by a cell phone.

1354
01:48:32,025 --> 01:48:34,937
That shows the people of
Detroit may have Alex

1355
01:48:34,963 --> 01:48:37,997
Murphy back on the street
sooner then they think.

1356
01:48:40,155 --> 01:48:43,518
The real tragedy here is that
our President

1357
01:48:43,596 --> 01:48:46,887
chose to uphold the Dreyfuss act.

1358
01:48:47,883 --> 01:48:52,612
I have no doubt that he
was manipulated by bias media.

1359
01:48:52,695 --> 01:48:56,830
And by whistle blower Dennett Norton.

1360
01:48:56,888 --> 01:49:00,708
I acknowledged we know
less then we thought.

1361
01:49:01,622 --> 01:49:04,783
But I do believe my
research program is sound.

1362
01:49:05,957 --> 01:49:08,372
What I did with it.

1363
01:49:08,461 --> 01:49:10,177
Was wrong.

1364
01:49:10,204 --> 01:49:13,033
The fact that this mother F****

1365
01:49:13,074 --> 01:49:16,766
is not serving time in
some federal penitentiary

1366
01:49:16,792 --> 01:49:19,867
is a huge hot heaping
pile of horse sh**

1367
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:30,723
I know some of you may think that
this kind of thinking is dangerous.

1368
01:49:30,802 --> 01:49:34,203
And these machines violate
your civil liberties.

1369
01:49:34,244 --> 01:49:38,405
Some of you even believe that the
use of these drones overseas

1370
01:49:38,458 --> 01:49:43,426
makes us the same kind
of bullying imperialist

1371
01:49:43,688 --> 01:49:46,093
that our forefathers were trying to escape.

1372
01:49:46,704 --> 01:49:51,893
To you I say: Stop whining!

1373
01:49:53,839 --> 01:49:58,955
America is now, and
always will be

1374
01:49:59,036 --> 01:50:03,474
the greatest country on
the face of the earth!

1375
01:50:07,507 --> 01:50:09,544
I'm Pat Novak.

1376
01:50:10,661 --> 01:50:11,724
Good night.

1377
01:50:11,749 --> 01:50:19,749
Thanks for watching!
