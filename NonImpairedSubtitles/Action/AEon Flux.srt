Lieutenant?

661
01:05:10,685 --> 01:05:13,324
We need weapons.
We need to get back into the Citadel.

662
01:05:13,445 --> 01:05:14,594
LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir.

663
01:05:24,325 --> 01:05:26,441
MALE ANNOUNCER: Attention.
Please return to your home...

664
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:28,123
and wait for further instructions.

665
01:05:28,245 --> 01:05:29,837
You will be updated frequently.

666
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:33,799
This is an announcement from the
Council and Chairman Oren Goodchild.

667
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:39,804
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

668
01:05:43,685 --> 01:05:45,676
- We're getting closer.
- Wait.

669
01:06:04,845 --> 01:06:06,039
Trevor.

670
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:10,162
The name you called me...

671
01:06:12,965 --> 01:06:14,193
Katherine.

672
01:06:15,445 --> 01:06:16,958
That was my name.

673
01:06:20,405 --> 01:06:21,918
You were my wife.

674
01:06:26,325 --> 01:06:29,203
We had a life together,
just like anybody else.

675
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:30,674
Wait.

676
01:06:31,965 --> 01:06:33,603
You need to tell me.

677
01:06:35,685 --> 01:06:39,439
I lost you during the disease,
and you couldn't be brought back.

678
01:06:40,005 --> 01:06:42,963
I've lived and died
seven times since then.

679
01:06:44,685 --> 01:06:47,245
TREVOR: And each time
I taught myself about you.

680
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:50,121
You were an idea I kept alive.

681
01:06:50,605 --> 01:06:52,561
Something I had to imagine.

682
01:06:57,565 --> 01:06:59,283
But when I saw you...

683
01:07:02,045 --> 01:07:03,763
what I felt was real.

684
01:07:04,605 --> 01:07:05,924
I knew you.

685
01:07:07,685 --> 01:07:09,198
I remembered you.

686
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:13,513
What we had then survived in us
past death, past everything.

687
01:07:15,685 --> 01:07:17,437
I was looking for you.

688
01:07:18,685 --> 01:07:20,243
I've been waiting.

689
01:07:21,805 --> 01:07:23,682
AEON: We were different people.

690
01:07:24,485 --> 01:07:25,634
TREVOR: We were.

691
01:07:26,405 --> 01:07:28,077
AEON: Those people are gone.

692
01:07:29,805 --> 01:07:32,000
But something in them came back.

693
01:07:33,245 --> 01:07:34,200
Yes.

694
01:07:49,405 --> 01:07:50,633
I remember.

695
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:54,797
It's chaos out there.

696
01:07:54,925 --> 01:07:56,802
There's a coup against Goodchild.

697
01:07:56,925 --> 01:07:58,802
Made it easier to slip in.

698
01:07:59,005 --> 01:08:00,358
Did you bring a way to find her?

699
01:08:00,485 --> 01:08:03,397
As long as there's a trace of the pill
in her, we can track her.

700
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:14,394
No.

701
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,640
Freya.

702
01:08:39,605 --> 01:08:40,833
It's gone.

703
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:44,444
I had cured it.

704
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:46,482
I'd found the answer.

705
01:08:46,965 --> 01:08:48,364
It's all gone.

706
01:08:51,285 --> 01:08:53,037
We have to keep moving.

707
01:09:01,685 --> 01:09:04,040
AEON: There's still
one more thing to do.

708
01:09:04,565 --> 01:09:08,194
There's nothing left to do.
You and I need to get out of here.

709
01:09:09,165 --> 01:09:12,237
We go outside the wall.
We'll find a way to live.

710
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:15,721
There's one more thing to do.
I need to destroy it.

711
01:09:16,525 --> 01:09:17,480
No.

712
01:09:19,965 --> 01:09:21,557
This isn't the answer, Aeon.

713
01:09:21,685 --> 01:09:23,915
There's no guarantee
I can find the cure again.

714
01:09:24,045 --> 01:09:26,923
- The cloning is all we have.
- It's not enough.

715
01:09:27,445 --> 01:09:30,960
Our minds are unravelling, and every
time you bring us back it gets worse.

716
01:09:31,085 --> 01:09:32,882
If you do this, we end.

717
01:09:33,365 --> 01:09:35,037
We're meant to die.

718
01:09:36,565 --> 01:09:39,159
It's what makes
anything about us matter.

719
01:09:41,365 --> 01:09:43,321
Living like this is torture.

720
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:45,003
We're just ghosts.

721
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:48,523
That's not how I feel.

722
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:51,720
Not now.

723
01:09:59,525 --> 01:10:01,038
Let's be careful.

724
01:10:01,525 --> 01:10:03,641
You know who we're up against.

725
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,683
- This is an empty gesture.
- It's a leap of faith.

726
01:10:12,805 --> 01:10:14,761
It's not for you to decide.

727
01:10:15,725 --> 01:10:19,081
Aeon, I don't want to lose you again.

728
01:10:20,445 --> 01:10:22,037
You don't have to.

729
01:10:23,245 --> 01:10:25,201
You'll find the cure again.

730
01:10:26,525 --> 01:10:28,117
OREN: It's over, Trevor.

731
01:10:35,525 --> 01:10:37,959
WEAVER: Moving into position
on the south spire.

732
01:10:40,645 --> 01:10:43,113
It goes so much deeper than your cure.

733
01:10:43,645 --> 01:10:46,205
Other women have been
getting pregnant naturally...

734
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,316
outside of your experiments.

735
01:10:48,525 --> 01:10:50,277
More and more of them.

736
01:10:51,365 --> 01:10:53,162
They healed themselves.

737
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,878
- And you killed them, too?
- I had to stop it.

738
01:10:57,765 --> 01:10:58,993
How many?

739
01:11:03,245 --> 01:11:04,439
How many, Oren?

740
01:11:05,165 --> 01:11:08,282
It doesn't matter.
Nature's finally found a way.

741
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:13,117
- In position.
- In position.

742
01:11:13,245 --> 01:11:14,519
GARDENER: Position acquired.

743
01:11:14,885 --> 01:11:17,683
Nature's the one who's obsolete, not us.

744
01:11:18,925 --> 01:11:22,918
OREN: How can you not understand
the beauty of what you made? I do.

745
01:11:24,205 --> 01:11:25,797
Situation's getting complicated.

746
01:11:32,365 --> 01:11:34,401
You told me she was gone.

747
01:11:38,725 --> 01:11:40,443
There was nothing that they could do.

748
01:11:43,965 --> 01:11:46,001
I ordered her DNA destroyed.

749
01:11:47,525 --> 01:11:49,800
You were a different man
with her, Trevor.

750
01:11:49,925 --> 01:11:52,962
She would've stopped you
from doing what needed to be done.

751
01:11:54,045 --> 01:11:55,842
- Like she's stopping you now.
- No, Oren.

752
01:11:55,965 --> 01:11:56,954
Yes.

753
01:11:57,285 --> 01:11:59,037
- Waiting for the go.
- On my signal.

754
01:11:59,165 --> 01:12:01,281
This world, our world, is beautiful.

755
01:12:01,925 --> 01:12:03,916
Worth preserving at any cost.

756
01:12:04,045 --> 01:12:06,354
It can't last. It's falling apart.

757
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,922
WEAVER: Sithandra, give us the signal.

758
01:12:13,805 --> 01:12:16,080
- Sithandra.
- Take Flux down first.

759
01:12:16,205 --> 01:12:17,240
You're wrong in this, Oren.

760
01:12:17,365 --> 01:12:19,640
We've beaten death, beaten nature.

761
01:12:20,805 --> 01:12:22,397
We've gone beyond you.

762
01:12:23,045 --> 01:12:24,956
And now I need to be free of you.

763
01:12:34,805 --> 01:12:35,840
Wait.

You know how much we're all suffering.

767
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:00,995
I'm trying to end it, and so is Trevor.

768
01:13:01,645 --> 01:13:03,476
I would never betray you.

Stay alive, Aeon.

826
01:19:34,445 --> 01:19:35,878
You are needed.

827
01:20:26,005 --> 01:20:27,154
Look!

828
01:20:38,285 --> 01:20:39,638
[Screaming]

829
01:20:44,045 --> 01:20:45,114
[Groans]

830
01:21:31,965 --> 01:21:33,876
AEON: Now we can move forward...

831
01:21:35,005 --> 01:21:38,281
to live once for real...

832
01:21:40,205 --> 01:21:44,676
and then give way to people
who might do it better.

833
01:21:52,085 --> 01:21:53,757
Hey, Katherine.

834
01:21:57,365 --> 01:21:59,083
Will I see you again?

835
01:22:09,365 --> 01:22:11,037
AEON: To live only once...

836
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,558
but with hope.
