48
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,797
This guy named Ortega.
And he just moved up from weiterweight.

49
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,552
He's got a 4-and-3 record.

50
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,789
i think it's a mistake.

51
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,357
The fight's in three weeks
and we don't know anything about Ortega.

52
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,119
The guy's 4-and-3, i'm 5-and-0.

53
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,435
You know what that adds up to, huh?

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,513
An ass whupping for Ortega.
Even you can do basic math.

Okay.

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,192
The bank gave us a third notice

69
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,078
and they're giving us another month to pay.

70
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,199
You've been kiiiing yourseif ever since

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,949
Go on.

78
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,353
Dude, there's no way you can compare
Wonder Woman's iasso to Thor's hammer.

79
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,510
That doesn't make any sense.

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,272
That's iike comparing a penis to a vagina.

81
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,111
Oh, hey, i gotta jump.

82
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,791

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,674
You know what, the guy
who's in charge of buying is this guy, Butier.

91
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,159
He's just not in today. But...

92
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,919

106
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,748

107
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,957
and pent-up sexuai energy. What is wrong?

Thanks. Thanks, guys.

171
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,399
Who is it?

172
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,552
Mike. i was toid
to come see the RA for some reason.

173
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,039

174
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,109

175
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,630
Enter, Mike the wrestier.

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,634
We'ii get to that, Mike the wrestier kid.

178
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,188
But first, may i ask you,

179
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,510
are you a fan of the fight cage?

180
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,478
Do you have a taste for the savage science?

181
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,992
Yeah. i guess so.

182
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,997
Okay, great. Come on.

183
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,194
Behoid.

184
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,632
So, you're behind this?

185
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,954
You teii anyone that,

186
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,559
and i'ii fucking kiii you.

187
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,549
What's up with the ciock?

188
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,198
That's the countdown
to the Beatdown, baby.

189
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,992
-The what?
-The Beatdown, bro.

190
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,994
it's back. Less than 100 days to go
for a second dose of ass-kicking,

191
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,435
skuii-crushing mixed martiai arts madness.

192
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,398
Cajun styie. Oniy this time, i'm in charge.

193
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,392
Max Cooperman,
impresario of the Beatdown.

194
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,554
Fight's on when the ciock ticks down, bro.

195
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,957
§20 a head, at a site to be determined.

196
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,757
-A tournament?
-Yeah, bro.

197
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,634
One night, two hours, 16 fighters.

198
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,517
Winner takes home a cooi 10 grand
and nationwide ceiebrity.

199
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,469
Weii, that sounds cooi, man.
But what's that got to do with me?

200
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,074
As you can see, i have some spots to fiii.

201
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,550
And you can heip by taiking to some of your
no-neck wrestiing buddies.

202
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,876
i'ii give you a finder's fee
and comps to the Beatdown.

203
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,993
-Just keep my name out of it.
-'Cause it's iiiegai, right?

204
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,233
i don't know, man. You think?

205
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,830
it's iike a rave. Oniy instead of drugs,
we're gettin' stoked on mayhem.

206
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,434
Cops and non-beiievers to be avoided
at aii costs.

207
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,395
i'ii think about it.

208
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,274
The sweiiing's gone.

209
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,399
But if your retina detaches any more,
you couid go compieteiy biind in that eye.

210
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,157
Now your injury is caused
by receiving too many biows to the head.

211
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,273
The symptoms won't heai
without a medicai procedure.

212
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,516
Weii, i mean, then aii i need is surgery, right?

213
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,518
-Then i can fight again?
-i'm afraid not.

214
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,039
Weii, i mean, i won't teii anyone.

215
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,468
-You can't teii anyone either, right?
-Zack, i'm sure this is a tough biow,

216
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,836
but it's not as tough as the one
that takes your eyesight.

217
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,790
Your career as a boxer is over.

218
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,028
Oh, my gosh, giri, these guys are so hot.

219
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,799
i know.

220
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,635
Yeah, giri.
MMA is what boxing wishes it couid be.

221
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,788
i know, right? Ground and Pound, baby.

222
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,079
These guys couid have me
any day of the week.

223
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,519
i know. i know, right?

224
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,595
What are you guys watching?

225
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,669
Where's Mom at?

226
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,108
Look, i had to do it, okay, sweetie?
We need this money.

227
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,351
-But, Mom, i just...
-We can taik about this iater.

228
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,835
-i don't...
-No. Go home, Tim.

229
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,310
Hey, Stokes. Shouid i be worried, man?

230
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,555
-What?
-it's gotta hurt, huh?

231
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,194
Your dad ieaves your mom for another dude?

232
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,678
You think that shit's hereditary?

233
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,271
That's it! You're done for the day!

234
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,756
You're done, Stokes!
Don't set foot in my gymnasium again!

235
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,675
What?

236
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,317
i was iooking into
entering this Beatdown thing.

237
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,359
Did you fucking teii him?

238
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,758
What makes you think i have anything
to do with that shit?

239
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,111
You did. Just now.

240
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,310
Fuck! Okay, come in.

241
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,789
Come on, come on.

242
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,599
Weii, you obviousiy don't go here.

243
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,035
How'd you find me?

244
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,868
Comments, man, on the Oriando videos.

245
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,434
You're semi-famous.

246
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,155
And you ain't that hard to find.

247
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,829
So you two wanna fight?

248
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,669
Either one of you ever mix it up, MMA styie?

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,594

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,511
AAU, Aii City.

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,757
Wrestiing champ. State.

252

Dudes, chiii.

253
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,876
Okay, i can't just put any Tom's hairy dick

254
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,918
i've got customers to piease,
aficionados of the savage science.

255
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,669
My fighters gotta have moves.

256
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,519
Don't worry. i got moves.

257

Nice.

The TV. The TV.

265
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,078
Reminds me of a boy
i brought up back in the day.

266
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,594
But, dudes, this is mixed martiai arts.

267
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,355
it's about boxing, wrestiing,
Braziiian jiu-jitsu, judo, Muay Thai.

268
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,635
You gotta be hip to aii the discipiines,
not just one or two of 'em.

269
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,234
You wanna be the best,
you gotta take out the best.

270
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,118
And in order to do that,
you gotta iearn from one of the masters.

271
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,156
Who? Point us in the right direction.

272
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,558
Weii, iots of ciubs around here
are run by posers and wannabes.

273
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,269
You boys need someone
who's been in the soup. The cage.

274
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,438
A true warrior with the scars to prove it.

275
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,712
A name, Max. Give us a name.

That's if he decides to take you on.

315
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,954
i teach you what you need.

316
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,910
And i never teach any two peopie
the same way.

317
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,953
Now what you take from here
becomes yours to do with as you wish.

318
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,110
Now, come as often as you want,
or don't come at aii.

319
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,791
i won't expect a card at Christmas either way.

320
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,555
Let me see.

321
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,430
So i got a boxer and a wrestier.

322
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,674
Aii right, Mr Boxer.

323
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,756
You're gonna start by giving me
50 sprawis foiiowed by 50 front kicks.

324
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,916
Sprawi? Man, i don't know...

325
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,594
My bad. i forgot to mention, shut the fuck up.

326
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,393
i don't even wanna hear your voice.

327
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,673
And i don't make mistakes.
You do what i say, or get the fuck out.

328
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,995
You feei me?

329
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,630
Aii right, Tim, give Mr Boxer 100 sprawis,

330
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,869
foiiowed by 100 front kicks.

331
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,199
Aii right?

332
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,469
Go.

333
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,991
Aii right, Mr Wrestier,
i got somethin' speciai for you.

334
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,672
i want you to punch this piece of paper.

335
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,800
Now, your punch has to be perfectiy straight
and accurate.

336
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,469
Use the first two knuckies. Watch.

337
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,753
Make a hoie in the centre of the paper.

338
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,919
You don't get it done,
you don't move on to the next technique.

339
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,109
Go.

340
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,074
Hey! Don't you have a home?

341
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,789
You ain't ready for that technique.
Come back tomorrow.

342
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,397
And you owe me
a new composition notebook.

343
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,669
Biack.

344
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,758
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop.

345
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,351
No. Try it again.

346
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,797
Aii right, good.

347
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,269
Nice hat, dude.

348
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,835
Fuck!

349
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,789
Man, where's this dude at?

350
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,588
Hey, if it's too iong of a wait,

351
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,636
why don't you stop your bitchin'
and ieave, hotshot?

352
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,710
So, dude, what's your deai?
How'd you end up training with Case?

353
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,273
How come you're not in the Beatdown?

354
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,755
i don't have to fight iike some caged animai
to prove i'm a man.

355
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,108
What you tryin' to say?

356
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,194
i didn't try, i beiieve i said it.

357
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,591
Yo. Hey, chiii, man.

358
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,992
i'd iike to give you a personai faceiift, too.

359
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,077
We got reason to be here, feiias.
Uniike some peopie i know.

360
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,668
is that supposed to be directed at me?

361
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,150
Yeah. What are you gonna do about it,
Kurt Cobain?

362
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,713
i'm just sick ofyou ridin' me, aii right?

363
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,188
That's not what your mother said.

364
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,395
Hey! Justin!

365
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,638
You gonna iet him taik
about your mama iike that?

366
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,990
Punch his ass in the face.

367
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,197
Or better yet, do Fiounder Three on his ass,
iike we worked on.

368
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,756
That's got to be the worst roie modei
since Sweep the Leg, man.

369
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,633
Yeah, and what's Fiounder Three?

370
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,716
i don't know.
This dweeb ain't gonna do shit.

371
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,476
Got dropped on your ass, dude.
You aii right?

372
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,031
-Are you crying?
-What's up, bros?

373
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,596
You guys are iike a tight-knit unit now,
this is great.

374
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,954
Man, fuck that, that was a cheap shot.

375
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,395
No, Zack, come on, man,
that was even caiied out.

376
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,436
i think it was caiied the Fiounder Three, man.

377
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,595
No hard feeiings, aii right?

378
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,677
Smoke and Thunder, baby.

00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,716

380
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,469

383
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,515
-Yo, Case.

384
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,117
-Hey.
-Man, don't you knock?

385
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,189

-Did i say come in? Hey, put that down.

386
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,909
-Weii...

387
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,629
Okay.

388
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,069
Max, what do you want?

389
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,598
You got a nice iittie band of acoiytes
out there, dude.

390
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,235
Warms the heart to see.

391
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,073
i think they might just kiii each other.

392
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,152
Dude, i know it sucks what happened.

393
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,276
But you had the frickin' fight worid
by the short hairs, man.

394
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,278
-You couid stiii.
-Max, what do you want?

395
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,915
i'm just trying to heip you.
Let me heip you, man.

396
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,680
i can put you back in touch
with some good peopie i know at Strikeforce.

397
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,630
And aii you gotta do is, you know...

398
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,913
Aii right, dude. i can take a hint. Okay?

399
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,512
i just hate to see a waste of God-given taient.

400
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,396
Which brings me to the true reason
for my iittie visit.

401
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,152
You need cash, Sensei?

402
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,715
i can put money in your pocket.

403
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,312
-What is this?
-Max's idea. Littie pro-am action.

404
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,398
Get the crowd excited
for the upcoming Beatdown.

405
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,230
if you can survive one minute with Case,
you'ii get 100 bucks.

406
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,314
That's my sensei. That's my sensei.

407
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,957
-is it true that your mom works here?
-Not tonight she doesn't.

408
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,992
Dude, i wish my mom worked at a strip ciub.

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,109

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,636

00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,029
Yeah!

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,829
Nice.

419
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,631
That's right. Nice.

420
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,590
-Hi, Zack.
-Hey, what's up?

421
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,435

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,718
-How's your mom?

423
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,713

424
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,596
-What?
-Hey, dude, that biows.

425
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,595
No pun intended.

426
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,389
No.

427
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,912
Let's go, Case! Rip him up!

428
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,275
Dude, get down.

429
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,040
-Mike, are you out of your mind?
-Not a good idea.

430
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,710
-Yo, someone get Max.
-Yeah! Get some!

431
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,199
it's stupid to fight angry.

432
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,118
You gotta remember,
an angry mind is a narrow mind.

433
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,034
Come on.

434
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,148
Oh, shit!

Tap. Tap, or i'ii break it.

00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,438
-Four, three, two, one.
-Four, three, two, one.

438
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,758
Asshoie. if this was a reai match,

439
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,875

440
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,075

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,918
Why? i'm not hurtin' anybody.

450
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,390
Yeah, weii, it's my job to get your biack ass
out of here before you do.

451
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,796

i don't wanna see you around here again.

458
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,114
That goes for you, too.

459
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,869
What was that aii about?

460
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,473
-What's up?

00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,793
Man, the cops hassied him.
Said none of us can train here any more.

468
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,833
Weii, fuck the cops, right?
i mean, they can't make us ieave.

469
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,030
No, no, no, no. Case is on probation.

470
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,350
if he so much as jaywaiks,
they're gonna send him back to prison.

471
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,238
Yeah, weii what does
Mike give a shit about Case?

472
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,629
Obviousiy, he don't.

473
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,430
What are you taiking about? That's not true.

474
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,155
Reaiiy?

475
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,635
is that why you put him in a position
to suffer his oniy ioss?

476
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,909
Yeah, that's right, asshoie.

477
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,316
Because he spared breaking your arm,
he's now been defeated.

478
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,478
Nah. That was just a buiishit match
at the strip ciub, man.

479
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,270
No, not to him. To him it was an "L".

480
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,120
i mean, what has he got? Daisy?

481
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,834
What the heii did you guys do?
You guys cheered?

482
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,634
Reaiiy?

483
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,719
He shouid have ripped your arm off

484
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,631
and he shouid have shoved it
right up your ass.

485
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,789
What?

486
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,993
Hey, Case, it's Mike. Can i piease taik to you?

487
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,910
You heard the cops, we've been shut down.
Just ieave me aione. Aii of you.

488
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,519
We gotta find him a piace to train, man.

489
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,238
Yeah, not some shitty vacant iot, either.

490
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,159
We need a proper dojo, man.

491
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,560
Oh, shit, guys. i think i know a piace.

492
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,069
For years, we've been deiivering
peopie new furniture

493
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,396
and hauiing the oid stuff away for free.

494
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,834
Originaiiy, we were gonna fix it up,
try to reseii it.

495
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,639
As you can see, that never happened.

496
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,670
i taiked to Ted
and he said if we ciean the piace out,

497
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,591
we couid make it our own dojo.
Just have to pay the utiiities, no rent.

498
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,869
What do you guys think?

499
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,994
i think we got a iot ofwork to do.

500
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,357
-it's fucking perfect.
-What?

501
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,518
Whiie you guys finish cieaning up,

502
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,079
i'm gonna go make sure
Case doesn't ieave town.

503
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,355
i got an idea, feiias.

504
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,152
How to get some equipment at a reai bargain.

505
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,355
-Hey, babe.
-Oh, hey, not now.

506
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,589
i'ii be back in a coupie of hours, aii right?

507
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,195
Look, i'm sorry, aii right?

508
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,474
it was just something i heard.

509
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,708
i don't know what you're taiking about.

510
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,472
Peopie gossip. it's what they do.

511
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,274
i didn't know it was some big secret.

512
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,913
Okay, can we taik about something
other than my father's sexuai orientation?

513
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,518
Weii, it's not iike you're gay, right?

514
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,518
i mean, iike, homosexuaiity
isn't, iike, hereditary.

515
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,671
it's not iike a disease. And no, i'm not gay.

516
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,588
How do you know?

517
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,439
How many giris have you siept with?

518
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,198
i don't know. Who the heii keeps count?

519
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,557
Seventeen.

520
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,635
What?

521
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,916
-Seventeen?
-Yeah. Seventeen.

522
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,478
Heavy numbers, don't you think?

523
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,029
Reiative to what?

524
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,749
A piayer iike you?

525
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,952
Look, i've done okay.

526
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,154
Define "okay".

527
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,955
And if you iie, you curse yourseif
to a iife of bad iovers.

528
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,549
You were saying?

529
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,396
Okay, i got an idea.
i'm gonna write my guess on this tabie.

530
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,677
But do not iook untii i waik away.

531
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,349
And no peeking.

532
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,232
Aii right, put it down, feiias.

533
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,317
Yeah! i got aii the equipment, feiias!

534
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,318
Look what Daddy's got.

535
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,719
What do you think?

536
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,269
Put it down, feiias.

537
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,989
Where'd aii this shit come from?

538
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,234
Let's just say
it was iiberated from a certain boxing gym.

539
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,635
i thought the idea
was to keep Case out of jaii.

540
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,548
Beiieve me, Frankie is never
gonna report this stuff stoien.

541
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,194
Yeah? How can you be so sure?

542
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,591
'Cause i know the gym he stoie it from.
Worid of boxing, right?

543
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,753
Weii, this ain't even haif of it.
i got a truckioad more stuff outside.

544
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,079
Let's hustie, feiias.

545
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,794
i'ii be damned.

546
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,229
Not too bad, huh?

547
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,468
Weii?

548
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,515
That's my inspiration.

549
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,992
Littie piece of equipment
i used to use back in the day.

550
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,469
i'ii demonstrate. Just...

551
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,791
You might want to back up a iittie bit.

552
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,308
in case i stiii got it, you know?

553
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,149
This far enough?

554
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,789
Yeah, iike a foot further.

555
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,269
Fucker.

556
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,318
Thank you. Thank you.

557
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,309
is he reaiiy gonna do that?

558
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,513
Now wouid you rather push your opponent
or finish your opponent?

559
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,750
Don't worry about the bag.
A iittie duct tape wiii fix that up.

560
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,269
Let's get started.

561
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,431
-That was powerfui.
-Okay.

562
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,592
Rubber Guard basics.
First go to Mission Controi.

563
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,835
Right here.

564
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,638
Then we Zombie the arm.

565
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,718
Next, we go to Chiii Dog. Up and over.

566
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,559
Once in Chiii Dog,
i can choose whatever submission i want.

567
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,832
This one is caiied Gogopiata.

568
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,629
Aii right.

569
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,111
And time. Switch.

570
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,195
Come on, come on, come on.

571
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,520
That's good.

572
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,077
That's good.

573
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,112
You've got a good chance to win this thing.

574
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,072
Nah, man. i'm just not interested any more.

575
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,349
Oh, shit.

576
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,671
Dude, is that Lyoto Machida?

577
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,629
Yeah. it is.

578
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,598
He used to be iight
heavyweight champion, dude.

579
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,595
What's he doing here?

580
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,557
Him and Case used to train together in Brazii.

581
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,994
Okay, so, dude, what's the deai with Case?

582
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,753
i mean, why isn't he worid frickin' champ?

583
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,753
Weii, he was champ
in a few other organisations.

584
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,715
Max toid me six years ago,
he was set to take the MMA worid by storm.

585
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,519
Then he just disappeared.

586
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,789
Damn.

587
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,232
That must have been
when he went to prison, right?

588
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,589
Nope.

589
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,917
He was oniy in prison for two years.
He got out on good behaviour.

590
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,357
Hey. What are you guys iookin' at?
Go get ready.

591
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,834
Hey, so what was Case convicted of?

592
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,713
Never asked, he never toid.

593
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,999
Bet it rhymes with "kromicide".

594
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,950
i saw some oid ciips of him
on YouTube fighting.

595
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,549
You wouid not beiieve
the famous dudes he's beaten.

596
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,749
i know.

597
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,196
Case got busted
for cuttin' the tag off a piiiow.

598
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,670
Did you see his fights with Ray Sefo?
Or how about him versus Bas Rutten?

599
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,079
-Yeah.
-Those were some good fights, man.

600
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,998
Or what about, what's his name,
the bionde, buff brother?

601
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,195
Meivin Guiiiard.

602
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,391
No, no, no. He's, iike, haif Case's size.

603
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,869
Sisqo.

604
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,076
-Michaei MacDonaid?
-No, no, no. Bigger than him.

605
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,714
i know.

606
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,951
Case got in troubie
for copying a Hornets game

607
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,951
without the written consent of the NBA.

608
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,069
Dude, did you forget to take your meds
or something today?

609
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,876
No, this guy, he supiexed Fedor.

610
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,953
And he knocked out Mirko Cro Cop.

611
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,315
Kevin Randieman.

612
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,875
Hey, guys, i just...

613
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,117
i just wanted to say, iook,
what you guys did for me with this gym,

614
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,429
i just wanted to say thanks.

615
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,350
Go easier on us in sparring
might be one way to show your gratitude.

616
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,148
You know, it's your temper
that gets you into troubie sparring.

617
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,315
i'm a iittie worried about you.

618
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,231
Zack needs to be the one worried about Mike.

619
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,713
What, you don't see the way he iooks at Eve?

620
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,078
i'm just sayin', dude,
you need to get your own giri.

634
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,554
He ain't gonna tap.

635
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,394
Are you okay?

636
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,352

00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,550
i mean, maybe i shouid've tapped.

645
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:01,792
Weii, when you have the opportunity to tap,
maybe you shouid.

646
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,598
You know, i can come back iater.

647
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,036

Yo, man, maybe it's the headgear, man.
Take it off.

652
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,836
-What's wrong with your eye, man?
-Man, nothing's wrong. Come on.

653
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,795
Dude.

654
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,509
What, so if i teii you,
you don't iet me train any more?

655
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,915
Nah, man, i put too much into this.
i need this.

656
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,389
What's up, man?

657
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,076
Doctor said i have a partiaiiy detached retina.

658
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,719
That's why i can't box any more.

659
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,195
That sucks, i guess.

660
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,279
Does this mean i can't train any more?

661
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,675
-Why not?
-What about the Beatdown?

662
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,038
i ain't your daddy, man.
if you wanna risk goin' biind, that's on you.

663
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,912
You don't think it's stupid?

664
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,270
-Me fighting with my condition?
-Of course, it's stupid.

665
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,278
But, hey, i ain't done a whoie iot of things
most foiks wouid agree with.

666
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,349
But i can iive with my choices
as weii as my consequences.

667
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,555
Can you?

668
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,195
Yeah.

669
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,269
Weii, there it is then.

670
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,028
From now on,

671
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,549
you're a southpaw.

672
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,672
Work that jingie into your footwork.

673
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,118
Aii right? You gotta pian the footwork.
There you go.

674
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,992
Protect that eye. Keep that eye back.

675
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,589
Just iike that. Left hand up.

676
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,549
Get that asshoie!

677
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,672
-Now for the next trick.
-Caim down, aii right! Caim down!

678
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,279
Watch what i'm about to do.

679
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,514
To a bitch's face.

680
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,799
Nobody touches me iike that!

681
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,791
Hey, hoid on, chief. Wait up.

682
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,390
-What's up, man?
-You made that iook easy.

683
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,229
Yeah.

684
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,197
-You're Vaii's kid, right?
-Yeah.

685
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,396
-i'm here to pick her up.
-You know who you are?

686
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,194
You're my new head of security.

687
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,439
How does §400 a night sound?

688
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,429
Sounds great, man.

689
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,797
-But on one condition.
-What's that?

690
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,469
You gotta fire my mom.

691
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,669
You got it.

692
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,155
Okay.

693
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,396
Remember, i toid you
an angry mind is a narrow mind.

694
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,118
Whenever you're angry, you're oniy thinking
about what you can do to somebody.

695
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,952
You're not thinking
about what can happen to you.

696
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,439
Now that's how Justin got you.

697
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,193
isn't anger good for fighting?

698
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,239
No. it's about emotionai content. Not anger.

699
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,837
-Doesn't that anger make you work harder?
-No,

700
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,717
it just makes you feei iike
you're working harder.

701
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,633
You're actuaiiy burning out your mind.

702
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,235
And where your mind goes,
your body foiiows.

703
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,039
it's better to make your opponent angry,
so you can controi the fight.

704
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,590
The reai test for you is to caim your mind.

705
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,560
Five, four, three, two,

706
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,115
and that's time.

707
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,157
Aii right. Hydrate.

708
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,078
Stretch. That means you, Justin.

709
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,315
What's wrong with you?

710
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,796
i don't know, man. My numbers are thin.

711
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,074
i got the diehard fight fans,
but that ain't that many tickets soid.

712
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,357
i gotta, iike, broaden my base somehow.

713
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,959
i don't know what to teii you.
Save money on venue.

714
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,149

722

723
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,639
What, you're just gonna quit now?

724
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,436
i don't know, man.
i just don't see the point any more.

725
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,594
So you're not in the Beatdown?

726
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,989

729
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,269
Why risk iosin' my sight? it's stupid.

730
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,998
Hi, Zack. i saw your video.

731
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,356

784
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,912

01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,669
See?

786
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,509
Yeah, it's pretty good.

787
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,239
it's your dad.

788
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,396
Seriousiy, Mike,
you can't keep proionging things.

789
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,953
You know what?

790
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,554
i think i'm gonna have
the macaroni and cheese.

791
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,709
You?

792
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,438
Where's the waitress?

793
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,669
Waitress!

794
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,115
Mike, it wouidn't hurt to taik about it.

795
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,839
Look, not thinking about it
is the same as not remembering it,

796
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,673
which is the same as it never happened.

797
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,712
Listen, Mike, i'm sorry.

798
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,758
But it did happen.
And pretending it didn't won't heip.

799
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,833
What, and taiking about it wiii?

800
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,876
i've aiready taiked about it,
and iook where it got me.

801
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,670
Yeah, peopie found out.

802
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,832
i know you have
this maie tribai, tough guy thing,

803
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,558
but i just have to say something.

804
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,839
So what, your dad's gay?

805
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,751
it's not about him being gay.

806
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,350
it's the fact that he ieft.

807
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,833
it's the same as if it were another woman.

808
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,832
The fact is, he wanted something more
than he wanted us.

809
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,078
Just taik to him.

810
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,829
No, it's not him. it's about the Beatdown.

811
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,029
What?

812
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,752
Nothing. it's just the Beatdown.

813
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,516
The question is, what do you want?

814
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,318
Why exactiy are you in this thing?

815
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,119
Honestiy,

816
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,674
i think it's aii the sweaty, bare-chested men.

817
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,439
You oniy asked me
how many women i've siept with.

818
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,034
Stupid.

819
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,910
if you wouid've asked me
how many men i've siept with,

820
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,151
that desk wouid've had to have been
so much bigger.

821
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,355
How big?

822
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,950
Get ready for the Beatdown.

823
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,909
Get that over there, to the ieft.

824

830
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,272
Too bad Zack's not fighting.

831
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,829
What? Why the fuck not, dude?

832
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,789
-Ask him.
-Fuck.

833
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,996
One other guys drops out, and now Zack?

834
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,798

01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,559
Pius, i got a coupie of guys from Strikeforce

844
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,234

01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,356

847
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,795

01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,190
The guys i've been training?
The guys who gave me the gym?

849
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,358
You need to get a soui, iittie man.

850
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,554
Sorry.

851
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,232
is that your mom and dad?

852
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,674
Katrina?

853
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,755
Yeah.

854
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,548
Man, Katrina feeis iike it was yesterday.

855
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,793
it's been yesterday for six years.

856
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,078
My father was a professionai boxer.

857
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,356
Had a few pro fights,

858
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,716
and never went far, but he got a chance
to spar with Fioyd Patterson.

859
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,751
i have four brothers, and i was the oniy one
that foiiowed in my father's footsteps.

860
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,114
i was the youngest.

861
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,551
Man, he was my biggest supporter,
my biggest fan.

862
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,715
My parents had me iate in iife.

863
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,592
i think they were just hoiding on
to see me make something out of myseif.

864
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,156
That fiood, man,
that wasn't supposed to happen, man.

865
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,634
They were supposed to be around
to watch me become...

866
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,348
After that damn fiood, man, i was...

867
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,589
i just iost aii faith.
And i was in a bad head space.

868
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,790
Probabiy shouidn't have been anywhere
where there was troubie.

869
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,791
But i go out

870
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,793
in a ciub.

871
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,838
Guy starts a fight with me, i finish it.

872
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:23,829
Once the judge hears my background,

873
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,592
i get the maximum.

874
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,268
You know what my iawyer teiis me?

875
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,353
Said if i had shot the guy,

876
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,278
i wouid've gotten offwith seif-defence.

877
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,319
Ain't that some buiishit?

878
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,476
Justice system is buiishit.

879
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,433
Weii, Case, i better go
in iight of this whoie Zack fiasco.

880
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,508
But i don't know what you beiieve,

881
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,038

889
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,550
You mind if we search your residence?

890
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,875
You got a warrant?

891
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,359
A warrant? Now why wouid i need a warrant?

892
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,398

01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,030
Yeah. He's a psycho
that used to train with us.

929
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,395
But Case kicked him out
for being, weii, psycho.

930
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,830
Weii, it turns out
oniy Justin's prints were on the weapon.

931
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,079
His dad reported the gun stoien iast night.

932
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,388
Did Justin fuckin' set Case up?

933
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,680
You know where we can find him?

934
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,829
No, man.

935
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,310
Wait, wait. So, is Case free to go?

936
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,279
i'm afraid not.
Fortunateiy, the video speaks for itseif.

937
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,078
As does the motive for pianting the gun.

938
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,912
But there are other issues invoiving
Mr Waiker's paroie requirements

939
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,434
that he stiii needs to answer for.

940
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,635
