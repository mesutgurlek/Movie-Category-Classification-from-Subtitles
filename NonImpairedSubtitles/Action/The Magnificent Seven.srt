1
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,236
Hilario.

2
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,036
Papa!

3
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,596
Sotero! My good friend.

4
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,915
How are ya?

5
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,150
You have a drink?

6
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,676
l can't tell you what a pleasure
it is to see a village like this.

7
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,310
Santos!

8
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,238
So much restlessness
and change in the outside world.

9
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,352
People no longer content
with their station in life.

10
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,199
Women's fashions? Shameless.

11
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,791
Cigar.

12
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,797
<i>#Mire!</i> Religion!

13
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,879
You'd weep if you saw how true religion
is now a thing of the past.

14
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,512
Last month we were in San Juan -
a rich town. Sit down.

15
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,428
Rich town, much blessed by God.

16
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,915
Big church.

17
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,830
Not like here - little church,
priest comes twice a year. Big one!

18
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,669
You think we find gold candlesticks,
poor box filled to overflowing?

19
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,631
You know what we found?

20
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,957
Brass candlesticks,
almost nothing in the poor box.

21
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,794
But we took it anyway.

22
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,878
l know we took it anyway.

23
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,879
l'm trying to show him how little religion
some people now have.

24
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,230
That l could see for myself.

25
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,676
Don't see!

26
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,796
What if you had to carry my load, huh?

27
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,913
The need to provide food, like a father,
to fill the mouths of his hungry men.

28
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,996
Guns. Ammunition.

29
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,989
You know how much money
that costs? Huh? Huh?!

30
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,633
No.

31
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,876
The days of good hunting are over.

32
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,790
Once there was horses, cattle,
gold, fruit from the trees. No more.

33
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,511
Now l must hunt with a price
on my head, <i>rurales</i> at my heels.

34
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,476
l'll be back.

35
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,636
Enough!

36
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,920
We'll get the rest when we come back.

37
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,835
l love this village.

38
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,959
- l know you have your problems...
- Murderer! Thief!

39
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,596
Rafael!

40
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,396
Stupid!

41
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,836
Stupid!

42
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,592
We have to have
another discussion very soon.

43
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,759
lt's always a pleasure to hear
the views of my good friend Sotero.

44
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,554
Maybe when l come back, hm?

45
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,715
#Adios!

46
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,796
Let's go!

47
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,356
Help me bring him in.

48
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,030
lf he steals our harvest again,

49
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,596
we might as well
cut our throats and be done with it!

50
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,154
Leave the valley. That's what we must do.

51
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,229
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us? Our farms?

52
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,868
We could hide some food.

53
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,793
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.

54
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,277
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.

55
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,356
We could beg him to leave us more.

56
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,678
No, no. That would make him more angry.
l don't think we should do anything.

57
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,473
We must do something!

58
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,194
Like Rafael? Talk sense.

59
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,790
We break our backs in the fields,
and our bellies stay empty.

60
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,549
- We must do something!
- We must do something.

61
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,791
But what?

62
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,876
l don't know.

63
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,275
We'll ask the old man.

64
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,470
He'll know.

65
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,512
Fight.

66
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,154
You must fight. Fight!

67
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,235
With machetes and bare hands
against guns?!

68
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,749
- Buy guns.
- Buy?

69
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,634
Go to the border. Guns are plentiful there.

70
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,752
But what are we going to use for money?

71
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,837
Sell that.

72
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,520
And anything else you can collect.

73
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,591
Even if we had the guns,

74
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,316
we know how to plant and grow -
we don't know how to kill.

75
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,715
Then learn.

76
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,796
Or die.

77
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,753
Hey! l've been waitin' for you.

78
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,520
Oh, you did a wonderful job.

79
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,757
- l'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?!

80
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,078
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as
ready as the embalmer can make him,

81
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,556
- but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't l pay you enough?

82
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,231
lt's not a question of money. For $20, l'd
plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.

83
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,159
But the funeral's off.

84
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,236
Well, how d'ya like that?!

85
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,638
l want him buried. You want him buried.
lf he could talk, he'd second the motion.

86
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,231
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...

87
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,828
Now, look. l'm not lookin' for any praise.

88
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,230
l'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.

89
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,874
l'm walking down the street
and a man drops dead.

90
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,470
For two hours people stepped over him,
without lifting a finger.

91
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,631
l'm doing what any decent man would.

92
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,433
- Come on, Henry...
- No! This man has to be buried.

93
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,599
- Soon. He's not turning into a nosegay.
- l know. l would if l could, but

94
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,117
- there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects? To what?

95
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,313
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What? ln Boot Hill?

96
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,876
There's nothing there but murderers,
cutthroats and barflies.

97
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,798
And if they ever felt exclusive,
they're past it now.

98
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,480
They happen to be white, friend.

99
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,556
And old Sam...

100
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,069
Well, old Sam was an lndian.

101
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,235
Well, l'll be damned!

102
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,035
l never knew you had to be anything
but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.

103
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,119
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.

104
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,708
lt's not my doin', boys.
l don't like it. No, sir.

105
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,037
l've always treated every man
as another future customer.

106
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,436
- ln that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.

107
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,519
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- lf it comes to gettin' his head blown off.

108
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,155
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it! So here.

109
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,353
Oh, hell! lf that's all that's
holding things up, l'll drive the rig.

110
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,508
Can l borrow that scatter-gun?

111
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,835
You're more than welcome.

112
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,273
Hey! Wait a minute there. This hearse cost
me $840. lt's the only one in the county.

113
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,188
- l'll be darned if l let it be shot at.
- l'll pay for the damages.

114
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,278
- l wanna see this.
- Me, too!

115
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,799
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.

116
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,474
Let her buck.

117
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,590
- New in town?
- Yeah.

118
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,951
- Where are you from?
- Dodge. You?

119
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,672
Tombstone. See any action up there?

120
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,554
- Tombstone?
- Same. People all settled down, like.

121
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,035
- Same all over.
- lnjun lovers!

122
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,720
Easy. Just wind.

123
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,153
- We'll get there.
- lt's not gettin' up there that bothers me.

124
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,635
lt's stayin' up there that l mind.

125
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,156
Comin' up behind us on the left.

126
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,150
l don't think so.

127
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,750
Second-storey window. Curtain moved.

128
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,077
l'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.

129
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,955
- You elected?
- No.

130
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,435
l got nominated real good.

131
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,272
Boys, why don't you just turn around
now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?

132
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,153
Soon, huh?

133
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,438
The reception committee is forming.

134
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,953
Hold it.

135
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,275
Hold it right there.

136
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,836
Anything wrong?

137
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,511
Turn that rig around
and get it down the hill.

138
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,789
l need six men up here.

139
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,592
Boys, the drinks are on me!

140
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,632
l'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.

141
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,517
Thanks.

142
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,790
Where are you from?

143
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,155
Oh, yeah. Where are you goin'?

144
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,436
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.

145
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,873
Boy, that was really something.
l won't forget that if l live to be a hundred.

146
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,798
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!

147
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,232
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.

148
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,590
Henry! The stage! Come on!

149
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,670
You keep this.

150
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,271
- Where are you headed?
- l'm drifting south, more or less.

151
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,152
You?

152
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,077
Just driftin'.

153
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,553
- Any action here?
- Yeah.

154
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,196
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those
bars across the street, if that's your taste.

155
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,949
Yeah.

156
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,036
Well, see ya.

157
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,795
Say, what's your name?

158
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,276
Make it Vin.

159
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,834
- What's yours?
- Chris.

160
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,875
Yes?

161
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,839
We think you are a man we can trust.

162
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,795
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.

163
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,117
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief. A murderer.

164
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,869
He and his men, they steal our food,
and then they leave us to starve.

165
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,276
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait. Just a minute.

166
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,279
- lf you need protection, go to the <i>rurales.</i>
- We did. Twice.

167
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,275
But they can't station men in a small
village for... who knows how long?

168
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,515
So they left.

169
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,599
And when they left, he came again -
Calvera - and every year since.

170
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,473
He will do so until he is stopped.

171
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,991
Sit down.

172
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,039
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.

173
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,993
We know nothing about them.

174
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,350
Will you buy guns for us?

175
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,438
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.

176
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,000
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?

177
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,590
Gunmen. Nowadays men
are cheaper than guns.

178
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,429
- Will you go?
- lt will be a blessing if you help us.

179
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,834
- Sorry, l'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no. We offer more than that.

180
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,793
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.

181
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,876
What's that?

182
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,958
We can sell this for gold.

183
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,036
Everything we own.

184
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,276
Everything of value in the village.

185
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,791
l've been offered a lot for my work,
but never everything.

186
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,911
Will it be enough?

187
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,669
You see, if we could
drive the bandits away,

188
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,394
life could be very good in our village.

189
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,071
But as it is, we ourselves
could stand it a little longer,

190
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,431
but the children,
they cry because they're hungry.

191
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,195
Do you understand what it means
when you start something like this?

192
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,470
We will fight, too. Every one of us.

193
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,478
When Calvera comes,
the church bell will ring the alarm.

194
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,068
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.

195
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,829
lf we don't, with machetes,
axes, clubs, anything!

196
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,237
Once you begin,

197
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,318
you have to be prepared
for killing and more killing.

198
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,113
And still more killing -
until the reason for it has gone.

199
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,118
- We understand.
- We've considered that.

200
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,959
Does every man in the village
feel the same?

201
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,036
Every man.

202
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,833
- l'll see what l can do for you.
- <i>Gracias.</i> You know...

203
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,110
Now, wait. l didn't say l'll go.

204
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,753
l'll pass the word around
that you're looking for men.

205
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,112
lt won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.

206
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,110
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.

207
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,471
But good men?
That's something else again.

208
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,955
How can you tell they are good?

209
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,676
There are ways.

210
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,275
Come in.

211
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,510
The word is out you're looking for men.

212
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,234
That's right. Men who are good with that.

213
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,318
- l'm good with it.
- Fast?

214
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,198
- Try me.
- l aim to. Step in closer.

215
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,200
Now, hold your hands like that.

216
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,196
Now, clap.

217
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,878
Faster.

218
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,150
Now, as fast as you can.

219
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,590
Now you try it.

220
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,359
Very young and... and very proud.

221
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,350
The graveyards are full of boys
who were very young and very proud.

222
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,236
Come in.

223
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,358
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry! lt's good to see you again.

224
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,789
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?

225
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,276
- l heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.

226
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,392
A dollar bill always looks
as big to me as a bedspread.

227
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,999
lt's just eating money.

228
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,318
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.

229
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,672
You old Cajun! You don't talk so good,
but you always know what's goin' on.

230
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,756
Oh, Harry.

231
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,030
With your permission.

232
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,669
All right. All that's on top.
What's underneath?

233
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,554
- Only what l told you.
- Gold? Cattle? Payroll?

234
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,468
- Only what l told you.
- Sure, never mind. Tell me when you can.

235
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,558
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!

236
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,148
l said never mind. l'm in.

237
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,236
You dirty dog!

238
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,236
Place your bets.

239
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,676
Five.

240
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,676
Five.

241
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,830
Eight.

242
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,795
Eights again. Ten at the point.

243
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,112
The cowpoke that just walked in
in the stovepipe chaps,

244
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,391
- l'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!

245
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,229
<i>Valgame Dios.</i> There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.

246
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,397
The man for us
is the one who gave him that face.

247
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,829
Hey, you learn fast.

248
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,350
Next bet comin' up.

249
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,396
Crap.

250
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,350
Next man.

251
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,798
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.

252
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,310
- Vin.
- Howdy.

253
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,035
- l'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.

254
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,390
Have you anything lined up?

255
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,149
Yeah. l'm gonna take a job
in a grocery store.

256
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,909
Fella says l'm gonna
make a crackerjack clerk.

257
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,792
Crackerjack.

258
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,070
lf that's your taste...

259
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,553
l heard of a job shooin' some flies away
from a village, but l don't know the pay.

260
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,557
$20.

261
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,399
- A week?
- Six weeks<i>:</i> the whole job.

262
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,636
Well, that's ridiculous.

263
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,193
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.

264
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,517
Shooing some flies away
from a little village.

265
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,956
Their village.

266
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,396
lt pays $20?

267
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,709
l'm looking for men right now.

268
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,829
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.

269
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,032
We understand. You could get
much more in a grocery store,

270
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,116
and it's good, steady work.

271
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,796
Yep.

272
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,755
How many you got?

273
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,551
Looking for O'Reilly.

274
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,708
Don't know his name, but there's a fella
in back choppin' wood for his breakfast.

275
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,396
Mornin'.

276
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,716
l'm a friend of Harry Luck's.

277
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,796
He tells me you're broke.

278
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,356
Nah, l'm doing this because
l'm an eccentric millionaire!

279
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,235
There's a job for six men, watching over
a village, south of the border.

280
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,508
How big's the opposition?

281
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,790
Thirty guns.

282
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,436
l admire your notion of fair odds, mister.

283
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,836
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds
in the Travis County war.

284
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,509
Well, they paid me $<i>6</i>00 for that one.

285
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,154
He said you got that Salinas thing
cleared up.

286
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,919
They paid me $800 for that one.

287
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,430
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...

288
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,994
That's right, l cost a lot.

289
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,108
The offer is $20.

290
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,116
$20?

291
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,988
Right now, that's a lot.

292
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,396
- Where can l reach you?
- Right here.

293
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,680
- l still say he can't.
- And l tell you he can.

294
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,110
- lf he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud. He might hear you.

295
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,879
l don't give a damn if he hears me or not.

296
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,878
l got two months' salary comin'.
l'll bet it all it ain't so.

297
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,434
- Well, you ain't bettin' with me.
- Me either.

298
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,551
l told you what he said, and l believe him.

299
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,877
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.

300
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,590
Britt. Britt, wake up.

301
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,749
l'm talkin' to ya! Look at me!

302
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,631
Filene told me what you said.
l say you're wrong. What d'you say?

303
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,799
What's the matter? You afraid?
Afraid to tell me l'm wrong?!

304
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,116
Call it.

305
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,590
Well, you see, l won.

306
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,790
Well, how about it?

307
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,276
Well?

308
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,078
- Filene, how about it?
- l don't know. lt was mighty close.

309
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,876
Close? What d'you mean, close? You all
got eyes. You saw what happened. l won!

310
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,151
You tell 'em. l won, didn't l?

311
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,236
You lost.

312
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,195
You're a liar.

313
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,790
l said you're a liar!

314
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,515
l said you're a coward and a liar!

315
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,118
Get up. Let's do it for real.

316
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,759
Get up!

317
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,348
Get up, l said!

318
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,189
So help me, l'll let you have it
right where you are.

319
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,876
- Call it!
- l want nothin' to do with this.

320
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,956
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace. Forget it.

321
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,719
Get away from me.

322
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,276
Call it.

323
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,111
- Britt.
- Chris.

324
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,954
Can l have a word with you?

325
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,110
Did you have any luck?

326
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,277
Found a man
who would have been perfect.

327
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,871
Gun or knife, you couldn't
want any better. Wasn't interested.

328
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,116
The money? lt wasn't enough?

329
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,670
He doesn't care a hoot about money.

330
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,076
A man in this line of work
who doesn't care about money?!

331
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,876
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.

332
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,276
Others, for reasons of their own,
enjoy only the danger.

333
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,197
And the competition.

334
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,916
lf he's the best with a knife and a gun,
with whom does he compete?

335
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,598
Himself.

336
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,796
You.

337
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,390
- l've been looking for you!
- What have we got here?

338
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,238
Never mind.

339
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,316
He knows.

340
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,112
Clap hands, he says.

341
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,755
Clap your hands,
and let's see how fast you are.

342
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,556
Clap hands!

343
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,358
A man comes to him cos he respects him,

344
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,038
cos he'd be proud to work with him.

345
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,193
He makes me look like two cents
with some damned kids' game!

346
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,393
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?

347
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,510
Come on, now,

348
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,029
and let's see how fast you are.

349
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,039
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!

350
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,677
Just draw.

351
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,234
Come on. Come on, draw!

352
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,636
<i>- Campesino.</i> Come on!
- You say <i>campesino</i> to me?!

353
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,552
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!

354
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,320
You don't think l mean it, huh?

355
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,355
You think l'm just talking, huh?

356
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,350
Hey, get up.

357
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,355
Do you hear me?

358
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,995
Get up and face me!

359
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,156
Do you hear?!

360
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,876
Hey,

361
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,955
give him my gun, huh?

362
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,994
Sorry this happened, friend.

363
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,429
Let him sleep it off.

364
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,269
When he wakes up,
let him have his gun back.

365
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,073
And give him a drink.

366
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,358
l changed my mind.

367
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,037
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.

368
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,590
Remember me?

369
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,556
Yep.

370
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,750
You need men to do a job in Mexico.

371
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,871
- That's right.
- How long?

372
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,592
Four, six weeks.

373
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,269
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?

374
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,150
l thought you were looking
for the Johnson brothers.

375
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,510
l found them.

376
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,349
- How much does the job pay?
- 20. We leave tomorrow.

377
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,873
l'll have the money before l leave.

378
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,912
lt'll just take care of
my last two days' rent.

379
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,510
$20? You must be livin' in style.

380
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,073
Yes.

381
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,830
l have the most stylish corner
of the filthy storeroom out back.

382
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,076
That, and one plate of beans<i>:</i>

383
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,512
$<i>1</i>0 a day.

384
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,957
Yeah, things do get high when
they find out you're on the run.

385
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,640
There's a dry wash south of town.

386
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,510
Pick me up there.

387
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,668
He's a good gun.

388
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,074
And we aren't heading for a church social.

389
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,356
Chris.

390
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,153
Yeah. He picked us up at dawn.

391
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,396
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah. That kid from the saloon.

392
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,718
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?

393
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,872
l'm getting a stiff neck
keepin' track of him.

394
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,992
lf you can't forget him,
why don't you ride side-saddle?

395
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,839
Ah, well, he won't last much longer.

396
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,110
That so?

397
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,874
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat -
what a chucklehead!

398
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,195
Yeah. Not smart like us!

399
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,996
Yep.

400
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,518
Suppose our friend over there
has got anything to eat?

401
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,155
- How about l bring him some?
- lt isn't food he's hungry for.

402
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,398
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch l can't scratch.

403
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,592
Leave him alone. lt's a free country.

404
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,676
And it's his.

405
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,354
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, l kinda miss him.

406
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,275
Where is everybody?

407
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,319
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis! Asuncion! Demetrio!

408
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,750
Emilio! Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?

409
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,556
Come out! Come out and make them
welcome, before we die of shame.

410
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,989
Hilario, stop your shouting.

411
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,231
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?!

412
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,635
Come in. You must be thirsty.

413
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,232
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.

414
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,715
They are afraid of everyone
and everything.

415
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,354
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...

416
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,308
The summer may be too hot,
the winter - too cold.

417
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,910
The sow has no pigs,
the farmer is afraid he may starve.

418
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,998
She has too many,
he's afraid she may starve.

419
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,357
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.

420
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,189
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of the founding of the village.

421
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,279
They will be celebrating -
then, you will see them in a better light.

422
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,548
Who sounded the alarm?

423
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,194
Who sounded the alarm?!

424
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,909
l did.

425
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,836
Thank you, amigos,
for coming out to greet us.

426
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,554
Thank you for letting us see
your beautiful faces!

427
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,513
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!

428
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,760
You come running out like chickens!

429
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,674
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.

430
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,592
And you?

431
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,836
You hide from us!

432
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,792
Hide from us!

433
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,675
But it's a different story
when you're in danger, huh?

434
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,268
You might lose your precious crops.

435
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,834
Then you flock to us. Huh?

436
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,750
Well, we're here, my compadres and l.

437
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,319
And here we stay.

438
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,951
And you?

439
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,278
You prove to us
that you're worth fighting for.

440
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,109
Now get back to your houses,
back to work. Go on! Go back.

441
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,711
We'll let you know when to fight and how
to fight. Go back! All of you, go back!

442
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,671
Go back!

443
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,636
Now we're seven.

444
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,993
You know, l've been in some towns
where the girls aren't very pretty.

445
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,113
As a matter of fact, l've been in some
towns where they were downright ugly.

446
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,630
But this is the first time l've been
in a town where there's no girls at all.

447
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,751
Except little ones.

448
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,429
lf we're not careful,
we can have quite a social life here!

449
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,917
lt's not so bad. l fell in with a fast crowd
that hangs out near the fountain.

450
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,192
We got to predictin' the weather for today
and didn't break up till twilight.

451
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,590
Stop the music! Bring out the other bull!

452
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,796
Hilario!

453
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,236
Britt.

454
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,551
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.

455
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,716
Lee.

456
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,798
- Get one alive.
- Yes.

457
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,156
l'll show you where.

458
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,918
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.

459
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,273
- l'm sorry, Britt. l didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!

460
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,356
That was the greatest shot l've ever seen.

461
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,391
The worst.

462
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,795
l was aiming at the horse.

463
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,752
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.

464
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,553
lt's almost certain they saw us.

465
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,269
Whatever they learned
will be buried with them.

466
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,516
<i>#Valgame Dios!</i> lf he comes now...

467
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,311
He'd never send men ahead
if he was near enough to see for himself.

468
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:31,070
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.

469
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,236
lf he rides in with no idea of
the reception we can prepare for him,

470
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,955
l promise you, we'll all teach him
something about the price of corn.

471
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,671
Aim,

472
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,950
squeeze,

473
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,878
cock.

474
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,718
Aim,

475
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,796
squeeze,

476
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,754
cock.

477
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,794
Settle down. Now, you miss the first
chance, you may not get a second.

478
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,313
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
lf you don't, two things will happen.

479
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,876
One<i>:</i> you'll waste a bullet.
Two<i>:</i> you'll break your arm.

480
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,233
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.

481
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,995
Fire.

482
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,917
That rock?

483
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,235
No, that man you're gonna kill.

484
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,717
Good!

485
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,308
lf only we had more guns,
think what we could do!

486
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,000
- You'll get more guns.
- How?

487
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,157
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.

488
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,669
The ones who spied on us brought them.

489
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,075
Like three kings bearing gifts.

490
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,635
lf Calvera does not come now,
after all of this,

491
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,830
what a waste!

492
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,235
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?

493
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,238
Senor, not a fox. A coyote!

494
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,272
How did he ever find out
about the gold mine?

495
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,356
Gold mine?

496
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,590
- What gold mine, senor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.

497
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,952
- ln our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.

498
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,595
Say, come to think of it,
it was a silver mine.

499
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,429
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.

500
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,348
- l mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.

501
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,870
Where did you hear
of this gold and silver, hm?

502
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,630
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?

503
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,316
<i>Toro.</i>

504
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,715
Come on, little bull!

505
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,436
You do anything to me
and l'll kill you while you are doing it.

506
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:01,270
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go. Let me go!

507
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,914
You bite me and l'll bite you!

508
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,990
l got a good mind
to throw you in the water.

509
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,634
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!

510
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,910
Shut up. Shut up!

511
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,639
- Where are the others? Huh?
- l'll never tell you.

512
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,235
Look what l found.

513
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,391
- Who is she?
- From our village.

514
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,272
So that's where they were. You hid them.

515
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,960
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.

516
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,390
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him - all of us.

517
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,115
Farmers! Their families
told them we'd rape them.

518
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,235
Well, we might.

519
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,592
ln my opinion, though, you might have
given us the benefit of the doubt.

520
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,154
But... just as you please.

521
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,755
As long as you were out there,
why didn't you bring 'em all in?

522
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,348
What for? Leave them out there.

523
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,948
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.

524
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,195
Bring them in.

525
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,276
Show him the way.

526
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,356
Ma'am.

527
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,713
Come on, little angel!

528
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,356
Gently, boy.

529
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,156
Gently.

530
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:53,193
l can't tell you how wonderful it was
for you senoritas to fix dinner for us.

531
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,872
- How's the food?
- Great.

532
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,470
Chicken enchiladas, <i>carne asada</i>
and Spanish rice. Looks good.

533
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,831
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.

534
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,350
Do you know what the villagers
have been eating since we got here?

535
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,199
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.

536
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,829
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

537
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,594
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

538
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,757
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

539
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,871
Do you have an older,
grateful sister at home?

540
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,515
- No, sir. Many thanks.
- You're welcome.

541
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,993
Many thanks.

542
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,959
One, two, three, four.

543
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,073
One, two, three, four.

544
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,039
One, two, three, four.

545
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,158
One, two, three, four.

546
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,358
One, two, three, four.

547
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,799
One, two,

548
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,194
three, four.

549
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,073
One, two, three, four.

550
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,436
Squeeze.

551
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,391
Miguel, didn't l tell you to squeeze? Hm?

552
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,875
Just like when
you're milking a goat, Miguel.

553
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,276
- lt's that l get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!

554
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,748
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.

555
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,075
All right, squeeze.

556
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,712
Squeeze!

557
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,355
l'll tell you what. Don't shoot the gun.

558
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,109
You take the gun like this
and you use it like a club. All right?

559
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,195
Right.

560
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,276
Flaco!

561
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,956
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

562
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,679
Good afternoon.

563
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,028
Howdy.

564
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,754
We've come to move you into the village.

565
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,714
- Move into the village?! Me?!
- Everybody who lives outside.

566
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,672
Oh, no.

567
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,756
We can't protect you out here.

568
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,474
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.

569
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,513
Rojas?! His conversation
would bore me to death!

570
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,036
Yeah, well,

571
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,993
- maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.

572
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,829
Farmers talk of nothing
but fertiliser and women.

573
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,714
l've never shared
their enthusiasm for fertiliser.

574
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:45,550
As for women,
l became indifferent when l was 83.

575
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,550
l am staying here.

576
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,911
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do
when Calvera comes?

577
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,873
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.

578
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,910
Don't worry. Why would he kill me?

579
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,039
Bullets cost money.

580
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,152
All right. Have it your way.

581
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,836
You worry about yourself.

582
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,030
Are you ready for him?

583
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,276
What if he comes now, eh?

584
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,119
lt's like that fella
who fell off a ten-storey building.

585
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,992
What about him?

586
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,113
As he was falling, people on each floor
heard him say ''So far, so good.''

587
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,390
So far, so good!

588
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,399
First of all, they'll see that ditch.

589
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,670
More water for the corn.

590
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,192
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.

591
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,516
Hey, Chris,

592
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,915
what about that net, eh?

593
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,600
Well, if he's not looking for it...

594
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,915
lf he rides in unsuspecting.

595
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,716
lf, brother!

596
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,796
lf!

597
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,197
Yeah.

598
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,276
Yeah!

599
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:58,070
l should have guessed. When my men
didn't come back, l should have guessed.

600
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,191
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.

601
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,877
New wall!

602
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,309
There are lots of new walls. All around.

603
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,276
They won't keep me out.

604
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,994
They were built to keep you in.

605
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,240
Did you hear that? We're trapped!

606
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,271
All forty of us! By these three.

607
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,836
Or is it four? They couldn't afford
to hire more than that.

608
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,474
We come cheaper by the bunch.

609
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,238
Five!

610
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,954
Even five won't give us too much trouble.

611
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,233
There won't be any trouble -
if you ride on.

612
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,759
Ride on?

613
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,032
l'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am l going to get food for my men?

614
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,276
Buy it or grow it.

615
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,675
Or maybe even work for it!

616
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,631
Seven!

617
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,917
Somehow,
l don't think you've solved my problem.

618
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,634
Solving your problems isn't our line.

619
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,990
We deal in lead, friend.

620
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,078
So do l. We're in the same business, huh?

621
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,674
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?

622
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,756
Suppose l offer you equal shares?

623
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,236
- ln what?
- Everything. To the last grain.

624
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,193
And the people in the village?
What about them?

625
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,076
l leave it to you.

626
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,590
Can men of our profession
worry about things like that?

627
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,439
May even be sacrilegious.

628
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,715
lf God didn't want them sheared,
he would not have made them sheep.

629
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,752
- What do you say?
- Ride on.

630
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,515
You hear that, Sotero?

631
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,835
You hear what he said?

632
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,791
Ride on.

633
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,876
To me!

634
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,675
You tell him to ride on
before l become angry.

635
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,836
Him, and the others!

636
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,636
Because, if l leave with empty hands,

637
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,231
everybody in this village
will answer to me - when l come back!

638
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,511
- You won't come back.
- Why not?

639
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,876
You won't have any guns.

640
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,398
Take them off right now and drop them.

641
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,438
Generosity. That was my first mistake!

642
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,480
l leave these people a little bit extra
and they hire these men to make trouble.

643
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:49,310
lt shows you<i>:</i> sooner or later,
you must answer for every good deed.

644
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,272
You were safe.

645
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,837
l was face to face with them as they
rode toward me. Ten of them, screaming.

646
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,555
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!

647
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,671
Ten. Ten!

648
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,356
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- lf they try it again, they'll get another!

649
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:43,837
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all. Calvera too, huh?!

650
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,317
Any sign of 'em?

651
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,750
- No.
- That is bad luck.

652
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,156
Can you imagine? l knew him
when he was a mouse!

653
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,318
l was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.

654
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:05,433
- l would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.

655
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,357
- You think so?
- Of course.

656
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,278
He'll go away. There are other villages -

657
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,960
other villages that don't sting
the way we do.

658
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,149
Senor!

659
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,077
Neighbours, l drink to our friends.

660
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:31,154
They armed us, fought at our sides,
and will forever live in our hearts.

661
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,275
They haven't gone, then.

662
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,718
- See the gun flashin'?
- No.

663
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,878
- l make it two of them.
- Three.

664
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,396
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.

665
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,997
Chico! Stay put.

666
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,748
- Three?
- Three.

667
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,309
O'Reilly? Do you see them?

668
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:45,274
No. They're too far back in the trees.

669
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,398
- Chris.
- Yeah?

670
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,957
Try and make it up to those rocks.
l'll cover you.

671
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,715
Chico, cover the back door.

672
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,876
Get back!

673
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,310
Get back! Go on!

674
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,829
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?

675
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,269
Get down. Now stay down!

676
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,471
Crazy kids! You might have been hurt.

677
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,797
- So might you.
- lt's not the same thing.

678
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,151
- This is my work.
- lt's our work, too.

679
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,716
Everyone tells us
''Hide! Get back! Stay out of sight!''

680
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,310
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave. lt's the truth.

681
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,274
So is he.
We all are - every boy in the village.

682
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,910
We had a meeting
and we drew straws and we got you.

683
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,319
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?

684
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,795
lf you get killed, we avenge you.

685
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,152
And we see to it that there's always
fresh flowers on your grave.

686
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,873
That's a mighty big comfort!

687
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,833
l told you he would appreciate that.

688
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,270
Don't you kids be too disappointed
if your plans don't work out.

689
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,278
We won't. lf you stay alive,
we'll be just as happy.

690
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,470
Maybe even happier.

691
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,991
Maybe.

692
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,435
Can you see them?

693
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,516
No.

694
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:13,992
Do your hands sweat before a fight?

695
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,595
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.

696
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,516
Funny...

697
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,954
Hands sweat,

698
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,548
mouth is dry.

699
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,831
You'd think it would be
the other way around.

700
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,876
Does my talking annoy you?

701
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,436
lt's because l'm...

702
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,830
l'm frightened, you know?

703
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,794
Yeah. l guess you kinda wish
you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?

704
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,876
Yes

705
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,116
and no.

706
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,150
Both at the same time.

707
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,751
Yes, when l think of,

708
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,836
of what he might do.

709
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,396
No, when l remember the feeling
in my chest this morning

710
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,556
as l saw him run away.

711
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,396
From us.

712
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,356
Man,

713
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,954
that's a feeling worth dying for!

714
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,557
Have you ever felt something like that?

715
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,030
Not for a long, long time.

716
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,671
l envy you.

717
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,113
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.

718
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,993
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.

719
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,429
All right, l won't. But go back.

720
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,319
- Does it hurt?
- What?

721
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,952
No.

722
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,433
l'm sorry l did it, but l thought...

723
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,910
- You know what l thought.
- Yes, yes. l know.

724
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,472
l wasn't afraid of you. lt's my father.

725
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,875
He says ''Stay away from those men.''

726
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,229
''They are brutes. They are cruel.''

727
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,193
He's right. Do you know that? He's right.

728
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,790
Well, go back home now.

729
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,438
He is wrong.

730
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,316
Well, go home anyway,

731
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,635
before he finds out you're here.

732
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,150
He already knows.

733
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:59,556
He said he'd punish me
for being so shameless.

734
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,556
But l don't care.

735
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,033
They got them. They got them all!

736
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,515
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?

737
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:24,156
l doubt it. For all they know,
we're still out there ready to jump them.

738
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,475
He didn't go. Calvera didn't go?

739
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,034
Did you think it would be that easy?

740
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,397
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?

741
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,557
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.

742
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,760
What else is there to do but wait?

743
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,675
- lt's Calvera's move.
- Right.

744
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,712
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.

745
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,558
- lf you were Calvera,
- Yes?

746
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:52,549
you'd go away, wouldn't you?
lf you'd paid the price we make him pay.

747
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,875
- Yes, l would, only...
- Only what?

748
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,031
Only l'm not Calvera.

749
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,153
Take the rifles and the <i>bandoleras</i>
and pass 'em out.

750
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,589
Now, let's get out there on duty.

751
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,077
Food, woman.

752
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,156
They'll be hungry.

753
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,548
That was... that was the greatest...

754
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,069
New hat for you, sonny.

755
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,631
- How do l look? Huh?
- Big improvement.

756
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,795
You know what? They'll make up a song
about you and this hat.

757
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:09,994
Villages like this make up a song about
every big thing. They sing them for years.

758
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:13,032
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?

759
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:18,109
lt's only a matter of knowing how
to shoot a gun. Nothing big about that.

760
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,268
Hey, how can you talk like this?

761
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,392
Your gun has got you
everything you have. lsn't that true?

762
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,110
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure. Everything.

763
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:40,756
After a while you can call bartenders
by their first name. Maybe 200 of 'em.

764
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,953
Rented rooms you live in<i>:</i> 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses<i>: 1</i> ,000.

765
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,594
Home<i>:</i> none. Wife<i>:</i> none. Kids<i>:</i>

766
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,076
none.

767
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,236
Prospects<i>:</i> zero.

768
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,394
- Suppose l left anything out?
- Yeah.

769
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:01,034
Places you are tied down to<i>:</i> none.

770
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,115
People with a hold on you<i>:</i> none.

771
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,800
Men you step aside for<i>:</i> none.

772
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,070
lnsults swallowed<i>:</i>

773
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,952
none.

774
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,230
Enemies<i>:</i> none.

775
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,040
No enemies?

776
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,074
Alive.

777
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,670
Well! This is the kind of arithmetic l like!

778
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,916
Yeah, so did l at your age.

779
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,634
Give these to someone
who knows how to use them.

780
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,955
Yeah.

781
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,992
Why don't you ask Calvera
what he has in mind for tonight?

782
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:39,317
Yes, do that.
And l'll write a song for you myself.

783
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,469
Andrs,
Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.

784
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,556
That's three.

785
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,793
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.

786
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,913
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where
they were caught by that cursed net.

787
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,189
Damn them!

788
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,675
Five and six.

789
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,758
Emilio going over the wall.

790
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,313
Seven.

791
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,715
Jos near the fountain.

792
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,118
Eight.

793
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,708
Gregorio near the fountain.

794
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,436
That's nine.

795
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,638
Nine.

796
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,830
Fortuno by the water ditch.

797
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,635
Rico in the fields,
where they slashed him to pieces!

798
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,957
That's <i>1</i>0 and <i>1 1</i> .

799
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,628
Go on.

800
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,478
Talk.

801
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,556
Talk! Talk!

802
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:53,311
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.

803
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:57,110
There's still plenty of us here
to make them pay.

804
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,910
Our friends down below.

805
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,756
Please, no!

806
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,395
lt's all right. You're all right.

807
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,353
You had a dream. Just a bad dream.

808
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,630
Have no fear.

809
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,076
''Have no fear''?

810
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,516
My very words.

811
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,516
<i>1</i>0,000 times a day.

812
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,794
Senor, don't punish yourself.

813
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:59,232
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.

814
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,315
Until the day you lose your nerve.

815
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,876
You feel it.

816
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,156
And then you wait,

817
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:21,431
for the bullet in the gun
that is faster than yours.

818
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:25,348
- Senor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.

819
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,549
No enemies<i>:</i>

820
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,636
alive.

821
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,718
l have lost count of my enemies.

822
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:41,030
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.

823
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,799
The final, supreme idiocy<i>:</i>

824
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,270
comin' here to hide.

825
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:53,675
The deserter, hidin' out
in the middle of a battlefield.

826
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,436
One.

827
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,311
There was a time
when l woulda caught all three.

828
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,268
We know what fear is.

829
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,834
We live with it all our lives.

830
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,230
Only the dead are without fear.

831
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,676
Rico!

832
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,355
Rico!

833
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,710
One minute, Mother!

834
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,994
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep,
and then we'll be back on duty.

835
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,510
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.

836
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,790
You're too young. Come on.

837
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,676
Bernardo O'Reilly!

838
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,590
You've been adopted.

839
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,158
Yeah, it's my real name.

840
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:24,478
Mexican on one side, lrish on the other,
and me in the middle.

841
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,110
Now, watch carefully. Here we go.

842
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,639
See? All three, right side up.

843
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,991
- Think you can do it?
- Of course. That's very easy.

844
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:41,669
Would you care to make
a friendly wager? A little bet?

845
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,758
- You know we have no money.
- lt doesn't have to be money.

846
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:48,998
Whatever you have hidden away,
buried out where Calvera can't find it.

847
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,519
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?!

848
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:55,031
Yeah. They tell me a lotta precious stones
have been dug out of the mountains.

849
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:57,799
Opals, emeralds, sapphires.

850
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,390
- Oh, yes. Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.

851
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,239
Well, then!

852
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,672
No! When you're finished,
they should all be right side up.

853
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,950
Let me try it again, eh?

854
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,437
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?

855
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,120
As you say, senor, in the mountains.

856
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:25,357
- Where in the mountains?
- That l couldn't tell you.

857
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,198
There! l got it!

858
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:30,278
Never mind that. Why can't you tell me?

859
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,960
Because l never have found
any precious stones.

860
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:38,797
Wait. You mean Aztec treasure buried in
the hills, from when the Spaniards came?

861
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:42,071
That's exactly what l mean.
Aztec treasure. Have you found some?

862
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,313
Would to God we had!
l would not be sitting here.

863
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,073
l'd be living in a big city, in a palace.

864
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:52,590
Then tell me this - how come Calvera
keeps hangin' around here?

865
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:56,599
Calvera... We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.

866
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,790
No, he will not.

867
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,558
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?

868
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,989
Calvera isn't worried
about food for winter.

869
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,750
He's worried about the food his men
haven't eaten for the last three days.

870
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,194
The price of corn is going up.

871
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,517
- They're starving.
- How do you know?

872
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,474
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?!

873
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,236
l've been up there.

874
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,594
Well, we'd better be ready for them.

875
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:36,157
- Because they gotta die or win.
<i>- Valgame Dios</i> if they do win.

876
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:39,511
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?

877
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,518
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered. What are we to do?

878
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,949
Keep on fighting.

879
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,230
Do you want to see us
killed off one by one?

880
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,828
That is not what you were hired for.

881
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:53,670
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and l told him!

882
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,358
l don't care.

883
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:58,711
Go away. All of you.
Get on your horses and go.

884
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,308
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.

885
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,637
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet! And listen to me!

886
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:07,115
No! lt is easy for them to say fight.

887
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:10,550
They have no sons,
no daughters, no wives.

888
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,955
Go. Now, before it's too late.

889
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,670
ls that what you want?

890
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,673
Answer me!

891
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:28,710
Who's for going on and who's for
giving up? l want to know now.

892
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:38,035
Don't be fools! You'll turn our village
into a graveyard.

893
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,311
Tell them to go.
lt's the only thing for them to do.

894
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:43,550
l'll tell you what l can do.

895
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:47,434
l can kill the first man who so much
as whispers a word about giving up.

896
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:51,314
The very first man,
so help me, l'll blow his head off!

897
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:19,592
We started this fight,
and we're gonna finish it!

898
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,756
With or without you.

899
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,036
l'm not sayin' we bit off
more than we can chew,

900
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:41,152
but we oughta talk about
what we're gonna do.

901
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,714
We start acting like
we had some good sense.

902
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,549
We figured to raise the ante just enough
to make Calvera play someplace else.

903
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,911
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.

904
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,395
- A man can't call 'em all.
- l didn't say he could.

905
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:57,672
All l'm saying is that sometimes
you bend with the breeze, or you break.

906
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,998
D'you wanna go?

907
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:07,353
There comes a time to get out. The village
will be no worse off than before we came.

908
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:10,756
You forget one thing. We took a contract.

909
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:14,668
- lt's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.

910
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,076
A noble thought,
but the way things are right now,

911
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,310
- l don't know.
- The odds are too high.

912
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,317
- Much too high.
- Then we go?

913
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,396
No.

914
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:31,150
We lower the odds.

915
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,555
Right up into the hills,

916
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,636
past the men on guard,

917
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,796
right into their camp.

918
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:44,557
l sat there, l smoked a cigarette
with them, we discussed a few things.

919
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,676
We, you know...

920
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,712
All of a sudden,
there was Calvera himself.

921
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,115
Right beside me.
When l brought back the news,

922
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:02,677
you should have seen the look l got
from Britt - and from Chris.

923
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,588
They have seen a thing or two
in their time, and done them too.

924
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:10,429
They're not men
you can impress easily. Oh, no.

925
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,678
But when they looked at me,
l knew l was one of them at last.

926
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,637
Well,

927
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,354
you'd better take a look at me, too.

928
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:28,393
Am l the kind of man
who'd live in a place like this? Hm?

929
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:31,754
Digging my life away out in the fields?

930
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,030
Me, a farmer - a peasant?

931
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,834
You know what l'm saying, huh?

932
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,555
Wherever they go -
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -

933
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:45,875
l go with them.

934
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:52,553
And if you think you, or anything you do,
could make me change my mind, forget it.

935
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:57,070
l want you to understand that.

936
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:01,400
l want you to understand that

937
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,476
this

938
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,588
will get you nothing but this.

939
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,158
We're going to hit Calvera,

940
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:25,238
maybe drive off some of his horses.

941
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,828
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.

942
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,190
l'll go with you. l know every rock.

943
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,675
No, you stay. You're in charge here.

944
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,995
You can count on me.

945
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,756
l know l can.

946
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:36,119
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.

947
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,515
We'd have heard shots.

948
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,877
They've gone.

949
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:16,830
Good evening.

950
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,350
You'll be dead. All of you!

951
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:42,559
Like that!

952
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,989
lf that's what you want.

953
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,350
Do we have a choice?

954
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,230
Of course.

955
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:54,191
Sit down.

956
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,276
Let's talk.

957
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:01,718
Things are turned around now, uh?

958
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:04,559
You're wondering how.

959
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:07,797
Your friends, they don't like you
very much any more.

960
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,434
You force them
to make too many decisions.

961
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,949
With me, only one decision.

962
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,071
Do what l say.

963
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,350
You should not be surprised.

964
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:21,758
My good friend Sotero,
he arranged to let me come in.

965
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,476
Understand?

966
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,795
Well, anyway,

967
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,354
to business!

968
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:35,119
l could kill you all. You agree?

969
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:48,395
Well, you don't disagree.

970
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:54,276
- Anyway, l don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?

971
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:58,318
Practical. They hear about it up north.

972
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,432
Maybe some friends of yours
make more trouble for me.

973
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:04,313
A man who never wants no trouble.

974
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,909
We have a saying here.

975
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:12,158
A thief who steals from a thief
is pardoned for <i>1</i>00 years.

976
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:16,159
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. l pardon you.

977
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:20,712
- Ride on.
- Just like that?

978
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:22,878
Just like...

979
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,073
l'll make it easy for you. You want food?

980
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,792
Give them food.

981
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:31,275
Water? All right. Water.

982
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,233
Horses? Saddled and waiting.

983
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,316
Guns?

984
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:41,555
The guns... the gun belts,
you take off and put here now.

985
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:50,240
What about these people?

986
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:55,229
What happens to these people will
happen whether l kill you first or not.

987
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:04,836
Just a little gesture, huh?

988
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,435
To show these people
who the real boss is.

989
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:12,518
You go, then l give you the guns back.

990
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:16,193
l know you won't
use those guns against me.

991
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,551
Only a crazy man
makes the same mistake twice.

992
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:51,638
l don't understand why a man like you
took the job in the first place. Hm? Why?

993
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:56,072
- l wonder myself.
- No, come on. Come on, tell me why.

994
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:59,795
A fella l knew in El Paso took all
his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.

995
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,990
l asked him the same question<i>:</i> why?

996
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,113
And?

997
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:07,994
He said ''lt seemed to be
a good idea at the time.''

998
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,876
Good!

999
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,358
Right.

1000
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:53,519
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.

1001
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:56,154
Your friends in there
owe you at least that much.

1002
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:59,795
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.

1003
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:17,357
You know, the first time
l took a job as a hired gun,

1004
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:21,155
a fella told me
''Vin, you can't afford to care.''

1005
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,512
There's your problem.

1006
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:26,438
One thing l don't need
is somebody telling me my problem.

1007
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:28,915
Like l said before, that's your problem.

1008
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:32,794
You got involved in this village
and the people in it.

1009
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:37,470
Do you ever get tired
of hearing yourself talk?

1010
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:41,513
The reason l understand
your problem so well

1011
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:44,632
is that l walked into the same trap myself.

1012
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,073
Yeah.

1013
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:50,431
The first day we got here,
l started thinking

1014
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:54,473
maybe l could put my gun away
and settle down and get a little land,

1015
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,192
raise some cattle.

1016
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:00,791
The things that these people know
about me wouldn't work against me.

1017
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:05,710
l just didn't want you to think
you were the only sucker in town.

1018
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,754
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.

1019
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:28,599
- You like us, don't you?
- l guess so.

1020
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:32,235
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, l'm one of us all right.

1021
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:34,749
- Take us with you! Please?!
- No!

1022
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,998
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are cowards.

1023
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:45,791
Don't ever say that again
about your fathers.

1024
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,672
They are not cowards!

1025
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:52,748
You think l am brave
because l carry a gun.

1026
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:56,509
Your fathers are much braver
because they carry responsibility.

1027
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:59,313
For you, your brothers,
your sisters and your mothers.

1028
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,910
This responsibility
is like a big rock that weighs a ton.

1029
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:07,113
lt bends and it twists them until finally
it buries them under the ground.

1030
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:11,358
Nobody says they have to do it. They do it
because they love you and they want to.

1031
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:16,510
l have never had this kind of courage.

1032
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:19,471
Running a farm,

1033
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:24,833
working like a mule, with no guarantee
what will become of it - this is bravery.

1034
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:29,873
That's why l never
even started anything like that.

1035
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,956
That's why l never will.

1036
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,357
You'll do much better
on the other side of the border.

1037
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:52,517
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.

1038
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:56,428
All you have to face is a sheriff,
a marshal.

1039
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,755
Once l rob a bank in Texas.

1040
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:02,270
Your government got after me
with a whole army. A whole army!

1041
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:05,796
One little bank. lt's clear, the meaning?

1042
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:09,157
ln Texas, only Texans can rob banks!

1043
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,799
#Adios!

1044
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,631
#Adios!

1045
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,238
l could have told you they'd sell us out.

1046
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,916
Farmers...

1047
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:34,674
Farmers!

1048
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:37,473
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.

1049
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,869
All they care about is their precious crops
and the miserable dirt they dig in.

1050
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,390
l hate 'em.

1051
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:52,712
- l hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.

1052
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:58,116
Because you come
from a village just like that one.

1053
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,435
You yourself are a farmer.

1054
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,836
Yes.

1055
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,390
Yes, l'm one of them.

1056
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:11,314
But who made us the way we are? Hm?

1057
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:14,190
Men with guns.

1058
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,833
Men like Calvera and

1059
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:20,430
men like you.

1060
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,869
And now me.

1061
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:29,469
So what d'you expect us to be?

1062
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:39,277
Nobody throws me my own guns
and says run. Nobody.

1063
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:44,558
lt took me a long, long time
to learn my elbow from a hot rock.

1064
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:50,031
Right now, l belong back in that
border town, sleepin' on white sheets.

1065
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:56,077
l think l'll ride back to that village.

1066
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:01,749
You're crazy, all of ya! They won't lift
a finger to help. Think of the odds.

1067
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,998
Harry, nobody's asking you to go back.

1068
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,838
Ride on, Harry. lt's all right.

1069
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:12,520
Bet your sweet life, l will!

1070
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:21,273
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed? Let 'em.

1071
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:25,279
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.

1072
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:28,950
Except to myself.

1073
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,795
You're crazy! All of ya!

1074
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,876
Come on.

1075
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:22,876
Hold on, Chris, l'll get ya outta there!

1076
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:03,674
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?

1077
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:05,756
l'd hate to die a sucker.

1078
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:09,589
We didn't come here just to keep an eye
on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.

1079
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:12,518
There was something else
all the time, wasn't there?

1080
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:16,235
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.

1081
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:17,998
l knew it.

1082
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:20,111
What was it?

1083
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,071
Gold.

1084
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:26,352
- Sacks of it.
- Sounds beautiful!

1085
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:30,590
- How much?
- At least a half a million.

1086
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:34,429
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.

1087
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:38,080
l'll be damned!

1088
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,070
Maybe you won't be.

1089
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:17,675
You came back.

1090
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:20,155
For a place like this.

1091
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:22,756
Why?

1092
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,831
A man like you?!

1093
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:28,076
Why?

1094
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:04,799
- Bernardo! Bernardo!
- No. No, get back. Go on! Get back.

1095
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,069
We didn't... We didn't mean to do it.

1096
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,430
We didn't mean to do it.

1097
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:27,150
You see?

1098
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:30,397
l told you. You see your fathers?

1099
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,236
What's my name?

1100
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:44,318
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!

1101
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:48,189
You're damn right.

1102
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:37,990
You could stay, you know.

1103
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:40,998
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.

1104
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:46,634
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes. The fighting is over.

1105
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,716
Your work is done.

1106
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:51,559
For them, each season has its tasks.

1107
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:56,993
lf there were a season for gratitude,
they'd show it more.

1108
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:01,755
We didn't get any more
than we expected, old man.

1109
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:05,030
Only the farmers have won.

1110
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:08,389
They remain for ever.

1111
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:11,114
They are like the land itself.

1112
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:14,788
You helped to rid them of Calvera,

1113
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:18,755
the way a strong wind
helps rid them of locusts.

1114
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,636
You are like the wind,

1115
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:26,356
blowing over the land and passing on.

1116
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,675
God be with you.

1117
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:37,268
Adios.

1118
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:19,876
Adios.

1119
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:26,868
Adios.

1120
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:00,229
The old man was right.

1121
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:02,396
Only the farmers won.

1122
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,476
We lost.

1123
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:07,355
We always lose.

1124
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:42,796
