1
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:12,990
He was just

2
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:15,728
all alone.

3
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:21,131
He couldn't enjoy a game with anyone else.

4
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:24,596
Like living inside a dream...

5
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:27,540
That's the kind of man he was.

6
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:34,310
Wake up.

7
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:37,112
Wake up!

8
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,724
Alright?

9
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:51,661
The world is like a steaming pot of stew.

10
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:55,094
lnside the mixed-up stew.

11
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:56,934
no ingerdient is any more
important than another.

12
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,706
ln the end, all you see is the combined product,

13
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:04,638
but there is one thing that you can't forget.

14
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:07,445
Do you know what that one thing is?

15
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:09,876
Meat?

16
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,208
Everyone thinks that,

17
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:17,852
but if there's no stew base, it's not a stew.

18
00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:21,625
With the same ingredients,
it could become a curry,

19
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:24,053
The stew base is on that counter over there...

20
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:25,762
l'm not talking about that!

21
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:30,002
Damn that robber bitches a lot.

22
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:32,271
Spike, let's go.

23
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:34,569
l'm going in from the back

24
00:01:35,142 --> 00:01:36,404
Alright.

25
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:40,313
lf you're waithin for the police,
it's useless,

26
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:43,113
We know all the security around here.

27
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:44,745
Why do you think we do this?

28
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,612
Engine, hurry, up and do it!

29
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:50,255
This is the mark of a security firm.

30
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,114
l was an employee there.

31
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:53,590
l see.

32
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:56,925
l was laid off and became'a robber.

33
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,490
lsn't that funny?

34
00:01:58,965 --> 00:01:59,761
l see...

35
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:01,499
Laugh.

36
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:02,732
ls it funny?

37
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,895
lt is funny huh?

38
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:09,436
l didn't tell you to laugh!

39
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:15,612
Hey! This place is closed.

40
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:16,973
Go somewhere else.

41
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,017
lf you understand, them hurry up
and put the money in this money card.

42
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:31,792
Who the fuck are you?

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,927
Hey! Can't you hear me?

44
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:37,431
Shit...

45
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:45,105
Hey! Take those off and listen to me!

46
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,039
l'll take this.

47
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,320
You bitch!

48
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:10,331
Spike!

49
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:11,769
Yeah?

50
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:16,772
Can you put the tab for the donut on them?

51
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:28,986
Don't move!

52
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,180
Jet...

53
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:33,253
Yeah?

54
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:35,126
You said three people.

55
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:36,890
Drop your weapons!

56
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:40,259
To deceive an enemy,
you start with your ally.

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,728
How does deceiving me help?

58
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:43,066
Are you listening?

59
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:45,370
Most of all, you took too long taking a shit!

60
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:48,239
Shut up! Don't you care if she dies?

61
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:57,478
Are you listening?

62
00:03:58,385 --> 00:03:58,976
You're ignoring me?

63
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:00,250
Can't you see her?

64
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,447
l'm sorry, Grandma.

65
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,153
We're not police or security guards

66
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:08,953
We don't think about saving civilinan lives.

67
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:10,427
What?

68
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:13,222
Seems it's not your day.

69
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,192
Damn it, he's a cowboy.

70
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,127
Hey! Hey! What are you saying?

71
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:18,826
You low life!

72
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,415
You're a cowboy?

73
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,416
Who...

74
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,744
Who are you?

75
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:40,857
Just your average bounty hunter.

76
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,618
Hurry up and go, Jet.

77
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:56,525
Don't rush me.

78
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:06,963
Huh?

79
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:09,669
Why don't you think before you go?

80
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:11,467
Hurry up...

81
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:14,379
ln the game of Shougi,

82
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:18,674
you think ahead and predict
the opponen't s moves.

83
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:21,111
Moves!

84
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,815
When the timing is right,
be where your opponent wants to be.

85
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,353
Being one step ahead is true purpose.

86
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:31,558
lt doesn't mean that you can just move
wherever you want.

87
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,967
l want to move here.

88
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:38,733
With just rules, you can't win at Shougi,

89
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:41,439
You don't get it, do you?

90
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:44,843
Alright, Spike, ln Shougi,

91
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,806
your personality shows in the game.

92
00:07:47,313 --> 00:07:51,010
lf you just play around when you feel like it and...

93
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:52,649
Hurry up...

94
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:56,852
Spike, if the hostage had been shot,
what were you going to do?

95
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,580
lt happens...

96
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:04,659
As usual, for a 125,000 wulong criminal,
there's too much risk involved

97
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:09,062
Bounty hunting is harder than just that.

98
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:13,365
Before l teamed up with you,
l lived a normal life.

99
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:23,209
Yes! Yes! That's the move l was going to make!

100
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:25,208
How about that, Spike?

101
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:31,154
Found him! Found him! Found him!

102
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,497
Knock knock, chick!

103
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,169
Ship number 12 took route 8 going into the city.

104
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:23,907
Okay.

105
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:25,768
Send me the car and the criminal's information.

106
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:27,545
Yes, yes.

107
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,211
Underaged, huh?

108
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,714
l hate taking care of kids.

109
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,105
lt's not him?

110
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:54,053
lt's time for CBC News.

111
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:56,624
Starting with today's top news...

112
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,759
At 10:00 am, on Albea City Number7 Highway
in the Red Hills Residential Area

113
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:06,730
an exploding gas tanker killed 72 people
and injured 15 more.

114
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,664
The impact was devastating.

115
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,976
Now to Ms, Lai Lee ,who is live at the scene.

116
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:14,343
l'm on site here, where

117
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:19,115
rescuers are searching for vicims,
and experts are analyzing the disater area.

118
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:22,050
After the original accident,
another incident occurred.

119
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:26,720
People up to three kilometers from the scene
started to lose consciousness and collapse.

120
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:29,390
For a short period, there was extreme panic,

121
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:34,591
Now, three hours later ,
things have started to calm down.

122
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:39,435
There must have been some sort of chemical
inside the tanker.

123
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:44,507
Yes, The police have told us that
the chemicals ignited and caused the explosion.

124
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,411
There is chance that this was a biological attack,

125
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:49,178
so because of that, no one can enter
the area of the accident,

126
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:52,247
Has the reaon for the explosion been confirmed yet?

127
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:55,613
At the moment, we don't know any of the details,

128
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:59,081
However, the gas tanker was reported stolen.

129
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:04,325
The police think that there is a possibility
of biological terrorism.

130
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:08,259
That's all for now. This was live from
the scene of the accident.

131
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:11,195
Every station is talking about this.

132
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:14,372
Again...

133
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,263
Huh?

134
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:19,600
lt seems like last night was also Cup Ramen.

135
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,903
Don't be an idiot,

136
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:25,442
Yesterday, and the day before,
all 3 meals were Cup Ramen.

137
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,083
Did you forget?

138
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,318
l see...

139
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:29,882
l thought it was a dream.

140
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,754
lf you prefer something else, l have others.

141
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:36,457
Cup Udon... Cup Soba...
lf you pull the string it's really hot.

142
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:42,396
We also have Cup Sushi, but that expired a year ago.

143
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:43,964
lf that's okay...

144
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:45,668
Thank yo for the food!

145
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:59,810
Humans can't always eat dried food.

146
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,778
We also need protein.

147
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:04,381
What are you talking about?

148
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:06,851
l'm saying meat tastes good.

149
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:11,857
Next time, you should catch a bigger one
instead of a smallre one.

150
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:18,397
Hey, Fays! How was it?

151
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:21,599
How was it? Listen to what l have to say.

152
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:27,540
So he's simple-minded hacker?
l'll get him after l go to the derby.

153
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:30,045
There was a weird explosion,

154
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:32,944
Well l'm taking one...

155
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,923
Yeah, this.

156
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:40,419
You were there?

157
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:44,229
So there's a big fuss about this, huh?

158
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:52,203
Huh? Virus? Weapon? Oh, l see...

159
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,767
Huh?

160
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:56,535
Hey, what's this?

161
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:58,371
Hey you guys! Even Ein?

162
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:02,641
You're dirty! Bacteria! Bacteria!

163
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:04,175
What was that?

164
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:05,781
Ah! Please, no! Stop!

165
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:07,107
Stop it! Stop it already!

166
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,148
Government officials have decided to put
a 300,00,000 wulong bounty

167
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,055
on the head of the perpetrator of this crime.

168
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:13,685
300,000,000?

169
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,023
Huh?

170
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:43,954
What's the meaning of this?

171
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,186
Even there?

172
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:46,149
Yeah.

173
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:54,431
How was it?

174
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:57,530
lt's strange,
l've never seen anything like this.

175
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:01,537
On most of the patients,
l can see brain activity.

176
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:03,601
There's absoulutely no clue as to what did it though.

177
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,409
We have no idea whatsoever.

178
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,344
l don't know any more than you do.

179
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:13,374
ln every patient, there was normal bodily activity,

180
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:16,450
but now they're all like new born babies.

181
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:18,953
ltjust gets worse.

182
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,923
Worse than natural causes, or the ebola virus?

183
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,493
lf anything, it's more like AlDS.

184
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:27,796
We can't tell what it is though.

185
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:29,632
What's that supposed to mean?

186
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,526
There's no evidence of anything ever being there.

187
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:35,269
lt's annoying that there aren't any clues.

188
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,910
The only thing that we can think of is

189
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,873
a new type of virus, or a biological weapon,

190
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,747
lt is ...

191
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:47,976
tremendously powerful.

192
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:50,518
Huh?

193
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,396
l'm sorry, it's my allergies.

194
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:11,640
l thought they were gone.

195
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:13,907
Maybe it has something to do with the virus.

196
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:18,782
Perhaps smeone is spreading it.

197
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:22,085
Ah... this is a smoke-free section.

198
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:27,386
He's teasting us.

199
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,527
Are you sure this is safe?

200
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,265
Even if it's not, you're coming with me.

201
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:36,696
l got it!

202
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,730
Bio-terrorism...

203
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:41,130
Spike, look at this.

204
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,598
l have no choice, huh?

205
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:43,840
Just to let you know,

206
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:45,301
my information isn't cheap.

207
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:46,667
l know

208
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,138
Hurry up and show me.

209
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:49,742
lt's very rare information.

210
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:51,639
Can you do it for us, Ed?

211
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:52,712
Alrighty!

212
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:55,150
This is the hacker, Lee Samsung.

213
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,217
He has a bounty of 5,00,000 wulongs.

214
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,253
and l've found his fake money card.

215
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:02,951
How did you do that?

216
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:05,388
l hacked into the card company.

217
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:09,523
Someone used it,
and the truck suddenly exploded.

218
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,435
The guy that was on it wan't Lee.

219
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:13,997
Maybe he was an ally.

220
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:16,436
l can't really tell.

221
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:19,404
What wouderful information...

222
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:24,612
You think we can catch him
with that messed up picture?

223
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,882
What are you saying?

224
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:28,651
l remember his face perfectly

225
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:30,616
Here you go!

226
00:18:31,123 --> 00:18:35,082
Use this pen.
You can write on the monitor with it.

227
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:38,722
On top of that, how can we be sure that
he's the criminal?

228
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:43,090
By being there without using a gas mask,
he'd already be dead.

229
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:44,967
That man is not dead.

230
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:46,596
How can you tell?

231
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:48,903
l just know...

232
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,903
You just know?

233
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:53,478
lt's kone.

234
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:54,540
Huh?

235
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:55,744
What's this?

236
00:18:56,482 --> 00:18:59,007
An Abangld's face or something?

237
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:02,046
This is great!

238
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:06,024
lf you can catch him with this drawing,
l'll pay the bounty!

239
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:07,324
ls that so...

240
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:08,851
lt doesn't matter anymore.

241
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:11,855
l 'll go catch him myself.

242
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:15,264
Ah, well that was a waster of time.

243
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:18,733
l'll go look around.

244
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,369
You do something?
What's the world coming to?

245
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:24,667
A woman's hunch can't be ignored

246
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:26,008
But...

247
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:29,537
Besides, sometimes l like to eat something
that's not inside a cup.

248
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:42,750
Back in the day,
there were planes flying all over the place.

249
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:44,349
Yeah, there sure were.

250
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,791
l used to fly a military transport

251
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:51,919
What are you talking about?

252
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:55,528
You flew a crop duster!

253
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:57,397
Really?

254
00:20:57,903 --> 00:20:59,302
Do you have a moment?

255
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:02,037
l have some questions.

256
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:06,239
We're too deaf to hear anything
so that's impossible

257
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:07,773
Do you know of a seed shop?

258
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,580
They sell seeds everywhere around here.

259
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:13,750
A store that doesn't sell seeds around here...

260
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:15,813
Police aren't welcome.

261
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:17,983
Do l look like a cop?

262
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,381
More like a Yakuza...

263
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,317
Same thing.

264
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:24,355
l'm a bounty hunter.

265
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,396
So you're a cowboy, huh?

266
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,859
l loved them a long time ago...

267
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:31,394
Then you know what l'm here for.

268
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:33,131
You're welcome even less now.

269
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:53,591
Are you the one looking for the seed plant?

270
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,658
Do you have one that can't be seen
by the naked eye?

271
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:05,160
Of course.

272
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:07,698
You can get anything on a Moroccan street.

273
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,239
lsn't that why you came here?

274
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:53,842
Do you want bean starch? Almonds?

275
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,552
This one's Carbaru seed,

276
00:22:57,056 --> 00:23:01,425
to get back at your wife when she's unfaithful

277
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:04,660
To see if it's a good or a bad seed, eat it fast.

278
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:06,587
lf it's poisonous,
you can throw it back up.

279
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:08,863
lf you eat it slowly,
the poison will go through your body,

280
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:11,327
and kill you before you can throw it back up.

281
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:12,695
l don't have a wife.

282
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:14,596
You're living in bliss then.

283
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,200
What l want to know is...

284
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:17,574
That seed is bad.

285
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:20,103
Pitacras died because of it.]

286
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:22,609
You can't make light of seeds.

287
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:31,949
The one l'm looking for is the virus
used in the ranker incident,

288
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:37,493
Do you believe in demons?

289
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:38,826
Huh?

290
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:42,725
ln this world, there are things
that exist an things that don't.

291
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:45,501
Why do people worry about things they can't see?

292
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:51,672
Why do people love the air
and want to fly into space?

293
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:56,041
lt's bacause we all used to be able to fly.

294
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:59,442
So this place is a path to the heavens?

295
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,610
Anything you can see in your mind can exist.

296
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:05,213
Even if you can't see it.

297
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:08,455
So there is a virus.

298
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:11,989
That's nothing like a virus.

299
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:53,299
Reachio! l've got something good.

300
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:55,433
This one suits you perfectly.

301
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,734
No, this pot fits perfectly for his man.

302
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:00,836
Huh?

303
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:03,611
Yes, this pot fits you perfectly.

304
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:05,377
How does it suit me perfectly?

305
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:08,377
You should always take what suits you.

306
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:11,846
Hey! l'm not here to shop.

307
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:14,054
You just bought something

308
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:15,017
Good bye

309
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:16,361
Hey, wait a minute!

310
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:17,658
En Chara!

311
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,826
Hey!

312
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:20,391
Wait! Hey!

313
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,138
20th century games are really good,

314
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:08,536
Games from this century are getting boring.

315
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:12,116
l'm enjoying old school games like this one.

316
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:16,176
Back in the day,
games like this were enought for everyone,

317
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:18,345
Hackers are the same.

318
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,350
lt was better when there weren't many.

319
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,491
Small things like that got you left
in the history books.

320
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:28,396
Now, protection is tighter everywhere.

321
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,325
lf you don't do something big,
no one will recoginze you.

322
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:34,538
That's why l'm grateful to you, seriously.

323
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:36,663
l always wanted to

324
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,208
try being a terrorist,

325
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:58,625
Aww, l died.

326
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,994
Let me see your license.

327
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:04,433
Where are you going?

328
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:07,164
From this point on there's only storage space.

329
00:27:13,946 --> 00:27:16,176
Aww, he died.

330
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,207
lf they can actually see the enemy,

331
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:46,037
Sheriffs can take care of things easily,

332
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:49,910
Well, that was inside the tanker?

333
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:53,283
Nothing.

334
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:55,309
What's that suppose to mean?

335
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,052
That's what it means.

336
00:27:57,456 --> 00:28:00,721
lt seems they've never heard of,
or seen it, before.

337
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:14,404
This is ?

338
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:18,469
Near the asteroids, we found a space truck.

339
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:21,269
The driver died instantly.

340
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,045
He was a convicted criminal.

341
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:24,609
A run-away?

342
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:29,350
The truck's owner was from a company
called Cherious Medical,

343
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:33,279
but they didn't even file a theft report.

344
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:36,157
There was a rumor that they had something critical

345
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:38,392
inside the truck that no one could find out about.

346
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:40,661
Then the tanker incident happened soon after.

347
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:42,396
Smessl fishy,

348
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:45,931
Even for a midical corpration
they have a heavy guard.

349
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:48,429
Why don't you forcefully investigate?

350
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,336
You can use any reason to get in.

351
00:28:51,877 --> 00:28:55,142
Things have changed since you left.

352
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:59,349
The lSSP is full of corrupt hyenas
who are just looking for money.

353
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:03,450
The higher ranks want more power.

354
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,815
The low lifes just get in with the Yakuza.

355
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:09,524
lf we get picked on,
it's not gonna be pretty.

356
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:11,092
Stinks like shit...

357
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:14,664
lt hasn't changed.

358
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:18,168
That's why l quit.

359
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:53,395
Do you know about Dengoku?

360
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:58,438
The place between Heaven and Hell.

361
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:04,944
lt is a place where people are left behind
and canot ascend into Heaven.

362
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:09,181
Yes, lt is about this world.

363
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,714
ls this all?

364
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:17,995
ln this one capsule,
there is 30,000 of them.

365
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:21,393
lf you open the capsule it will
create copies of itself.

366
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:24,364
Hey, be careful with it!

367
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:27,137
What about the money?

368
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,770
lsn't this different from your offer?

369
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:38,649
You'll get the other half after the party.

370
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:41,349
You can do with the rest as you please.

371
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:43,452
uh, yeah...

372
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:45,755
l'll be saying good bye to this cheap life.

373
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,190
Can l ask you a question?

374
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:53,057
Why on Halloween?

375
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:55,294
ln the old days,

376
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,864
Halloween was a day when people prayed
for souls to go to Heaven.

377
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:05,200
You should pray.

378
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:23,051
Amigo!

379
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:28,062
Everyone in the Milky Way wants
to get that 300,000,000!~

380
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:31,593
Just like every day, it's time for the Big shot!

381
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:35,636
Like always, we'll be giving out information on bounties!

382
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,807
Today, we'll be on air twenty minutes longer then usual!

383
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:43,375
All because of the main target
of you bounty hunters,

384
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:46,912
and because he's worth 300,000,000 wulongs!

385
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:50,516
He's the galaxy's highest bounty ever!

386
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:54,450
The only problem is that we don't know who he is,
or what he looks like!

387
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:55,954
Don't we have any information to give out?

388
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:57,192
Nope!

389
00:31:57,596 --> 00:31:59,496
We don't even know what was spread out
from the explosion!

390
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:01,160
There's no one living who saw the incident!

391
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:04,027
Then what are we supposed to be doing?

392
00:32:04,469 --> 00:32:06,437
Because of this, we'll be taking calls!

393
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:10,239
We'll be giving this gift go anyone
with information!

394
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:13,842
You can us with this number!

395
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:15,703
First come, first served!

396
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:23,677
Ahem...

397
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:26,852
Well, for now, commerical break!

398
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:29,519
Well, that was useless.

399
00:32:30,128 --> 00:32:31,322
Faye! Faye!

400
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:32,491
Huh?

401
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:34,263
Can you look?

402
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,058
The previous shot.

403
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:45,707
Tattoo?

404
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:49,204
l looked for the same mark,

405
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:52,844
Which one is ti?

406
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:56,685
Which on is it...

407
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:57,718
lt's this one.

408
00:32:58,123 --> 00:32:59,454
ls that right?

409
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:02,583
Yeah, it's this one for sure.

410
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:07,730
Mars Special Force Fleet number 7.

411
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,359
Special Force mark, huh?

412
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:11,464
A military man...

413
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:14,100
lt was disbanded three years ago.

414
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:16,368
Do you have any date on this Force?

415
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:17,605
Yeah.

416
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,044
Huh?

417
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,074
What' this?

418
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:24,847
They're almost all dead.

419
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:27,277
Go to the next one.

420
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,144
What's wrong, Ein?

421
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:32,854
Really?

422
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:34,191
What? Hurry up!

423
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,251
Ein said it's him.

424
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,953
How does Ein know?

425
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:43,395
Look, he died in the Titan War.

426
00:33:44,736 --> 00:33:46,601
Damn it l quit, Clean it up.

427
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:48,096
Okay...

428
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:50,998
Finding information this way doesn't suit me.

429
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:57,509
Living life easily and not doing
much suits me a lot more.

430
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,311
Faye!

431
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:04,087
Why do l have to be with these peolpe
and lose my beautiful 20's years?

432
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:05,617
Faye! Faye!

433
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:07,584
l wonder... where did l go wrong?

434
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:09,960
Lee used the card again!

435
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:12,189
Oh! l forgot about that!

436
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:16,796
Hey, What's that, pottery?

437
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:18,233
Yeah, something like that.

438
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:26,408
Oh? ls my gift an octopus pot?

439
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:27,439
Well, yeah...

440
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:28,970
Who's this?

441
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:34,007
Ein said it's this person,
but Faye doesn't believe him.

442
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:35,283
Huh?

443
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:38,178
She says it's one of these five.

444
00:34:38,523 --> 00:34:40,923
Vincent Boraju...

445
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:42,723
Spike...

446
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:44,026
Did you find anything?

447
00:34:47,198 --> 00:34:48,290
What's this thing?

448
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,997
lt's the pot''best suited'' for me.

449
00:34:50,535 --> 00:34:51,365
How about you?

450
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:55,102
The western was really good.

451
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:57,103
Hey...

452
00:34:57,475 --> 00:34:59,375
Let Ed see too!

453
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:05,879
Very amusing.

454
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:08,276
We should sell her to the circus.

455
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,283
l asked the detective,
but l only found out that

456
00:35:12,824 --> 00:35:15,987
there's a weird chemical place

457
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,886
There's something inside.

458
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:22,933
What's this?

459
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:36,710
Hey, you're pretty good.

460
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:38,780
Here they come.

461
00:35:40,952 --> 00:35:42,351
Are you alone?

462
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:44,414
lf you want, l can play with you.

463
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:45,753
You're right,

464
00:35:46,224 --> 00:35:48,283
but not these virtual games,
l prefer reality.

465
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:50,119
Reality?

466
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,429
We finally meet, hacker boy.

467
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:59,403
l was only 500 points away

468
00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:02,302
from meeting Spooky Donkey.

469
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:04,699
Are you listening?

470
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:06,837
Damn it.

471
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:09,337
You alomost never get to him.

472
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:13,574
How are you going to pay for this,

473
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,476
bounty hunting lady?

474
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:17,717
Do you have any idea what kind of
situation you're in now?

475
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:20,487
Game over, boy.

476
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:24,256
Revenge for Spooky Donkey is great.

477
00:36:26,898 --> 00:36:27,694
Huh?

478
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,900
What? What''s going on?

479
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:36,740
Wati!

480
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:47,774
What? Wait!

481
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:13,103
lt's a weird shape.

482
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:16,247
So, what's inside?

483
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:19,578
lt's a lyn lyn lymphocyte.

484
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:23,086
Lymphocyte? The ones that are in your blood?

485
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:26,616
This one has a weird shape though.

486
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:28,084
How so?

487
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:30,720
l don't really know anything about these.

488
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:34,229
This is the real lymphocyte,

489
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:37,396
but this one's a bit different.

490
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:40,231
How is it different?

491
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:42,103
Zoom in.

492
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:47,475
l still don't understand.

493
00:37:48,046 --> 00:37:49,741
Then let's microwave it.

494
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:50,842
What?

495
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:54,546
lt's a really weird shape.

496
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,092
What?

497
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:13,828
What's that?

498
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:54,770
Hello? Total Clean Corporation?

499
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:16,199
Please continue with your report.

500
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:21,833
The lSSP is investigating this incident
as a terrorist attack.

501
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,435
They have no idea who's behind it though.

502
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:29,811
The ''object '' they're investigating is a virus.

503
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:32,645
They won't be able to find out anything for a while.

504
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,010
However, we must be cautious.

505
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:41,190
ln the Moroccan street, there was
some information given about the accident.

506
00:39:41,592 --> 00:39:45,426
We have encountered the spy,
but Mendel went into hiding.

507
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:50,559
We must solve every problem for this case.

508
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:53,803
lt's a problem that will affect
the whole nation.

509
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:58,572
Did Vincent really use ''that?''

510
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:04,245
That is a demon that can't be seen.

511
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:07,244
lt's something that shouldn't exist,

512
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:11,749
and is forbidden from living.

513
00:40:12,256 --> 00:40:14,053
Vincent and Mendel...

514
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:16,989
Do you understand?

515
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:18,419
Yes.

516
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:25,391
Do you know where my car is?

517
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:28,201
Didn't you just leave?

518
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:14,614
Put your hands in the air.

519
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:20,718
l've seen that face before.

520
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,425
You look pretty good.

521
00:41:25,563 --> 00:41:27,053
That doesn't make you look good.

522
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:28,092
ls that so?

523
00:41:28,933 --> 00:41:30,161
Look backwards.

524
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,047
What do you know?

525
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:53,618
Do you want to pick?

526
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:55,822
lf it's heads, l'll speak honestly.

527
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:12,139
For a medical lab office lady,
you're pretty strong.

528
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:15,677
Knowin too much is sure to shorten your life.

529
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:18,072
Strong girls are my type.

530
00:42:50,248 --> 00:42:51,078
Hurry!

531
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:16,096
Happy Halloween, trick or treat?

532
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,793
lf you don't give me something good,
l'll do something bad.

533
00:44:20,237 --> 00:44:22,797
l'm smaller then what you know

534
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,232
l can't be seen by your eyes.

535
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:27,867
Flesh and bones are also made from me.

536
00:44:28,846 --> 00:44:31,041
What does he mean?

537
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:35,245
l don't understand, but in biological terms,
there are a lot of meanings.

538
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:38,320
Did you guys see an out of fashion hat?

539
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:40,379
This is more important.

540
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,952
There was a message from the bounty.

541
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:44,452
Maybe it's a trick.

542
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:46,862
l would have thought the same way,

543
00:44:47,298 --> 00:44:48,890
if l hadn't seen what was in the pot.

544
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:50,062
Pot?

545
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:55,069
From its appearance,
it looks like a lymphocyte.

546
00:44:55,539 --> 00:44:58,474
ln reality, it's made up of thousands
of tiny machines.

547
00:44:59,243 --> 00:45:01,871
These are what they call ''nano-machines.''

548
00:45:02,246 --> 00:45:02,905
Nano-machines?

549
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:04,405
l see...

550
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:05,476
What do you know about it?

551
00:45:05,783 --> 00:45:06,374
Nothing.

552
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:08,308
What was that?

553
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:12,311
Well, it's a machine so small that
it can't be seen by human eyes.

554
00:45:12,757 --> 00:45:15,225
On top of that, they are made of proteins.

555
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:19,126
Your favorite proteins.

556
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,565
They can't be eaten, and are only used
for medical purposes...

557
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:26,936
Why was that thing inside the pot?

558
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:33,639
Anyway, lymphocytes aren't suppose
to be made of protein.

559
00:45:34,078 --> 00:45:34,908
And?

560
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:38,804
Whoever wrote this message
knows exactly what this is.

561
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:40,114
And?

562
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:41,877
That's it.

563
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,412
You have no idea what it is.

564
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:47,890
This was a waste of time.

565
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:51,193
How was the medical lab?

566
00:45:51,796 --> 00:45:53,491
lt's one great place.

567
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:56,092
They make some powerful medicines there.

568
00:45:57,168 --> 00:45:59,932
All of their guards are equipped with G-21s.

569
00:46:00,337 --> 00:46:03,329
G-21s? Those are military issue machine guns!

570
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:06,308
The public can't buy them.

571
00:46:06,877 --> 00:46:09,573
There was a girl with
the same tattoo as Vincent.

572
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:12,113
That girl...

573
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:14,084
What about her?

574
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:15,646
She's pretty fine.

575
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:19,515
Anyway...

576
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:22,620
lf it involves the Army, the story changes a lot.

577
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:26,986
Solving one mystery has only made
the whole thing more mysterious.

578
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:30,566
Hey, what are you doing?

579
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:33,934
At times like this, it's best to sleep.

580
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:35,229
Hey...

581
00:46:35,606 --> 00:46:36,868
Treasures should sleep and wait.

582
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:39,542
Oh yeah, l forgot.

583
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:41,778
l came here to look for a hat.

584
00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:42,805
Do you know anything about it?

585
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:43,942
No.

586
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:46,315
Where did it go?

587
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:51,748
Smells weird...

588
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:54,083
Do you know, Ein?

589
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:23,948
l wonder if it's here.

590
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:33,185
Trick or treat? Give me something
or l'll do a trick.

591
00:47:33,597 --> 00:47:35,895
Shut up! Halloween's tomorrow!

592
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:45,870
That's not it.

593
00:47:48,946 --> 00:47:51,312
l'm going to do a trick.

594
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,346
Oh really? Go ahead.

595
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:56,815
Gimme!

596
00:47:57,254 --> 00:47:59,518
Maybe l should do a trick, little boy.

597
00:47:59,957 --> 00:48:00,889
l'm not a little boy.

598
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,589
l'm a girl.

599
00:48:05,062 --> 00:48:08,589
What? l have no use for girls. Go home!

600
00:48:13,404 --> 00:48:14,701
lt's not this one either.

601
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:35,380
Found him!

602
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:44,030
Yes? Yes? Hello?

603
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:45,663
Found him! l found him!

604
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:46,694
What?

605
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:48,128
Ed, what's going on?

606
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:51,201
l found Lee! l found him!

607
00:48:51,475 --> 00:48:52,601
Greatjob.

608
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:54,942
l always knew you weren'tjust an average kid.

609
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:55,903
Where are you now?

610
00:48:56,313 --> 00:48:58,338
l'm sending you my current location.

611
00:48:59,483 --> 00:49:02,941
Stay there and don't move. l'm on my way!

612
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,784
Ohay, got it.

613
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:06,315
Bye bye!

614
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:15,992
l finished level one.

615
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,298
Easy as cake.

616
00:49:18,802 --> 00:49:20,497
You're playing the same game?

617
00:49:21,138 --> 00:49:22,105
is it fun?

618
00:49:22,506 --> 00:49:23,598
What kind of game is it?

619
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:29,477
She's just a little kid, damn it.

620
00:49:30,914 --> 00:49:34,907
Those mornos... Which building?
Which room?

621
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:41,224
ln solitaire,
every ball you jump gets taken away.

622
00:49:42,192 --> 00:49:45,093
Then, if you are left with
only one ball, you win.

623
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:47,654
Ah, it's over.

624
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:49,157
So you win?

625
00:49:53,203 --> 00:49:54,932
The game's climax is about to start.

626
00:49:56,173 --> 00:49:57,299
What are you talking about?

627
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:03,677
Wait a minute, is that ball...

628
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:05,547
lt is only a game.

629
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:11,652
lt can't be...

630
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:15,814
You're kidding, right?

631
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:18,957
There is only one left.

632
00:51:09,713 --> 00:51:11,476
l can't meet...

633
00:51:11,882 --> 00:51:14,476
Spooky... Donkey...

634
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,147
Hey!

635
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:19,083
lt's not good for me if you die!

636
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,321
Get up!

637
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:23,689
Please restart...

638
00:52:44,808 --> 00:52:46,469
Emergency call from Alpha One.

639
00:52:47,077 --> 00:52:48,772
We have located Humpty Dumpty.

640
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,415
Current location is 24 point one five.

641
00:52:52,783 --> 00:52:53,943
He's moving.

642
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:55,342
l'll come right over.

643
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:57,380
Don't do anything until l get there.

644
00:52:57,988 --> 00:52:59,148
But l will.

645
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:05,885
He's entered between one seven
and one eight.

646
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,999
He's heading towards the central station.

647
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:35,991
This way! l'll go with you!

648
00:53:36,593 --> 00:53:37,855
l'll be fine alone.

649
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:38,784
But...

650
00:53:39,129 --> 00:53:40,061
Take care of my car.

651
00:55:03,547 --> 00:55:04,275
Vincent!

652
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:07,546
l don't know your face.

653
00:55:07,985 --> 00:55:12,547
but l can tell by your smell,
you reek of blood.

654
00:55:13,624 --> 00:55:15,558
You're a bounty hunter?

655
00:55:16,026 --> 00:55:17,323
Don't think badly of me.

656
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:23,499
lt's your fault for getting
a 300,000,000 bounty put on your head.

657
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:09,912
Why don't you shoot?

658
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:11,073
What?

659
00:56:11,715 --> 00:56:12,511
What's wrong?

660
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:14,744
You only talk at the start?

661
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,412
Do it.

662
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:19,878
l won't kill you.

663
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:21,824
l don't want to lose the bounty.

664
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:24,688
l do not fear death.

665
00:56:25,362 --> 00:56:27,489
You quietly watch a dream.

666
00:56:28,532 --> 00:56:31,000
A dream that continues forever.

667
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:35,032
What a messed up guy.

668
00:57:43,907 --> 00:57:45,431
ls that all?

669
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:32,516
What is your name?

670
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:35,950
Spike...Spiegal.

671
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:39,791
l'll meet you at the end of this world.

672
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:40,997
Vincent!

673
00:59:18,468 --> 00:59:20,163
Vincent...

674
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:24,605
You...about me...

675
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:04,010
Why?

676
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:17,719
Vincent...

677
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,189
You know what, Spike?

678
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:52,393
That was a close call.

679
01:00:54,731 --> 01:00:56,198
He died.

680
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:59,427
No. He was already dead.

681
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:03,462
Just like you.

682
01:01:26,863 --> 01:01:30,822
The man who sank his body in the river.

683
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:33,564
His eyes found you.

684
01:01:39,843 --> 01:01:41,003
Thanks.

685
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:45,874
What did you see?

686
01:01:46,316 --> 01:01:48,443
Your eyes are half closed.

687
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:53,285
l was... watching a dream.

688
01:01:56,793 --> 01:02:00,991
l never knew what a dream was,

689
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:06,862
and for the first time l tasted fear.

690
01:02:08,905 --> 01:02:12,306
Just a little something was off.

691
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:15,167
l was dead.

692
01:02:17,414 --> 01:02:21,714
lt wasn't a good day for you to die.

693
01:02:27,123 --> 01:02:29,614
A swimming bird.

694
01:02:30,493 --> 01:02:33,826
Those blue dreams see through everything.

695
01:02:34,164 --> 01:02:36,098
The past, the future,

696
01:02:36,633 --> 01:02:38,260
and also now.

697
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:43,463
Everything flows and everything is connected.

698
01:02:43,973 --> 01:02:46,840
These eyes aren't looking at reality.

699
01:02:47,343 --> 01:02:49,903
lt's feeling the truth.

700
01:02:51,548 --> 01:02:54,039
Open the true eyes.

701
01:02:54,551 --> 01:02:57,452
You have nothing to fear.

702
01:02:59,722 --> 01:03:03,590
Yeah, l know...

703
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:24,974
Seems like you're alive.

704
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:30,277
What about him?

705
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:32,744
Vincent...

706
01:03:34,057 --> 01:03:35,422
He disappeared,

707
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:38,687
as though he was never here.

708
01:03:41,598 --> 01:03:45,056
We put ourselves in great danger.

709
01:03:46,436 --> 01:03:47,596
Yeah.

710
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:50,165
My father use to say this:

711
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:55,901
A ship that goes out to sea either
goes on sailing or sinks.

712
01:03:57,313 --> 01:04:04,116
We're only bountly hunters.
This is something that we can't handle.

713
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:07,151
We can still get out now.

714
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,549
Our involvement in this case is over.

715
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:10,950
Alright, Spike?

716
01:04:12,629 --> 01:04:13,687
Hey...

717
01:04:18,701 --> 01:04:20,566
You sure do sleep a lot.
