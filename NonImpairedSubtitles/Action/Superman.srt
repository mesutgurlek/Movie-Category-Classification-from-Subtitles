1
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:44,888
"In the decade of the 1930s
even the great city of Metropolis...

2
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,053
"...was not spared the ravages
of the world-wide depression.

3
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:51,127
"In the times of fear and confusion...

4
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:55,264
"...the job of informing the public
was the responsibility...

5
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:56,767
"...of the Daily planet.

6
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:59,099
"A great metropolitan newspaper...

7
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:04,302
"...whose reputation for clarity and truth
had become a symbol of hope...

8
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,400
"...for the city of Metropolis. "

9
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:43,107
This is no fantasy.

10
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:47,377
No careless product of wild imagination.

11
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,044
No, my good friends...

12
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:53,786
...these indictments...

13
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:57,461
...I’ve brought you today...

14
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:02,490
...specific charges listed herein
against the individuals...

15
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:07,337
...their acts of treason.
Their ultimate aim of sedition.

16
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:11,634
These...

17
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:16,641
...are matters of undeniable fact.

18
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:23,151
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

19
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:25,983
...on those accused.

20
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:34,959
On this...

21
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,731
...this mindless aberration...

22
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:42,032
...whose only means of expression
are wanton violence and destruction.

23
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,741
On the woman Ursa...

24
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,375
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

25
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:54,350
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

26
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:05,086
Finally, General Zod.

27
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:08,564
Once trusted by this Council...

28
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:12,496
...charged with maintaining the defense
of the planet Krypton itself.

29
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:17,069
Chief Architect of this intended revolution
and author of this insidious plot...

30
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:20,410
...to establish a new order amongst us...

31
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:24,611
...with himself as absolute ruler.

32
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:29,014
You have heard the evidence.

33
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:32,956
The decision of the Council
will now be heard.

34
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:33,820
Guilty!

35
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:37,054
Guilty!

36
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,619
Guilty!

37
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,932
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

38
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:48,268
It has therefore now become your decision.

39
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:50,866
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

40
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:53,770
...and you alone will be held responsible
by me!

41
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:03,617
Join us!

42
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,882
You have been known to disagree
with the Council before.

43
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:13,754
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order, second only to my own!

44
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:18,059
I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El!

45
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:20,430
Take it! Join us!

46
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,504
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

47
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:28,106
I swear it!
No matter that it takes an eternity!

48
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,048
You will bow down before me!

49
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,983
Both you and then one day...

50
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,349
...your heirs!

51
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:09,269
Forgive me, forgive me....

52
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:31,128
An unpleasant duty
has been masterly performed, Jor-El.

53
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:34,300
They have received the fate they deserved.

54
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:37,363
Isolation in the phantom Zone...

55
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,569
...an eternal living death.

56
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:43,742
A chance for life, nonetheless.

57
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:45,908
As opposed to us.

58
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:48,814
It’s suicide.

59
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,148
No, it’s worse, it’s genocide.

60
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:54,222
Be warned, Jor-El.

61
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:58,685
The Council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

62
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:03,394
My friends, you know me
to be neither rash nor impulsive.

63
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:08,605
I am not given
to wild unsupported statements...

64
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:12,970
...and I tell you that we must evacuate
this planet immediately.

65
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:17,281
Jor-El, you are one
of Krypton’s greatest scientists.

66
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:19,312
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.

67
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,214
I don’t question your data.

68
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,348
The facts are undeniable.

69
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,662
It’s your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

70
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:40,694
This planet will explode within 30 days.

71
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,028
If not sooner.

72
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:45,308
I tell you Krypton
is simply shifting its orbit.

73
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:47,007
Jor-El...

74
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:49,411
...be reasonable.

75
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,509
My friend...

76
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:58,447
...l have never been otherwise.
This madness is yours.

77
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,485
This discussion is terminated.

78
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:04,627
The decision of the Council is final.

79
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:26,408
Any attempt by you to create...

80
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:30,250
...a climate of fear and panic
among the populace...

81
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:34,119
...must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

82
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,884
You would accuse me of insurrection?

83
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:40,653
Has it now become a crime to cherish life?

84
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:44,900
You would be banished
to endless imprisonment...

85
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,935
...in the phantom Zone:

86
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:48,839
The eternal void...

87
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:52,000
...which you, yourself discovered.

88
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:57,511
Will you abide by the Council’s decision?

89
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,578
I will remain silent.

90
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:07,749
Neither l...

91
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:11,086
...nor my wife, will leave Krypton.

92
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:08,377
Have you finished?

93
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:12,485
Nearly.

94
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:20,023
It’s the only answer, Lara.

95
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:21,961
If he remains here with us...

96
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,459
...he will die as surely as we will.

97
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:26,934
But why Earth, Jor-El?

98
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:29,772
They’re primitives,
thousands of years behind us.

99
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:32,472
He will need that advantage to survive.

100
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,573
Their atmosphere will...

101
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,440
...sustain him.

102
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,422
He will defy their gravity.

103
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:51,527
He will look like one of them.

104
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:54,428
He won’t be one of them.

105
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:55,896
No.

106
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:59,998
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

107
00:16:01,806 --> 00:16:04,274
He’ll be odd. Different.

108
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:09,538
He’ll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

109
00:16:11,115 --> 00:16:13,845
Isolated. Alone.

110
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:19,554
He will not be alone.

111
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:27,491
He will never be alone.

112
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:40,209
The energy input to Jor-El’s quarters
is now in excess.

113
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:43,607
Our data indicates the loss
is due to a misuse of energy.

114
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:45,676
Investigate.

115
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:49,476
And if the investigation proves correct?

116
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:53,782
He knew the penalty he faced.

117
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:57,361
He even is a member of this Council.

118
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:01,698
The law will be upheld.

119
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:47,066
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

120
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:51,071
But we will never leave you.

121
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:54,412
Even in the face of our death...

122
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,685
...the richness of our lives...

123
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,023
...shall be yours.

124
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,761
All that I have, all that I’ve learned,
everything I feel...

125
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:08,856
...all this and more, l...

126
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:12,964
...l bequeath you, my son.

127
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:18,607
You will carry me inside you...

128
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:21,878
...all the days of your life.

129
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:25,782
You will make my strength your own...

130
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:29,142
...see my life through your eyes...

131
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:32,219
...as your life will be seen through mine.

132
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:37,954
The son becomes the father,
and the father...

133
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,361
...the son.

134
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:45,532
This is all l...

135
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:52,270
...all I can send you, Kal-El.

136
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:14,129
...which Einstein called his theory
of relativity.

137
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,007
Embedded in the crystals before you...

138
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:20,840
...is the total accumulation of all literature
and scientific fact...

139
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:22,943
...from dozens of other worlds...

140
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:25,311
...spanning the 28 known galaxies.

141
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,029
Early Chinese writings point out
the complex relationship between....

142
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,643
By carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power, my son....

143
00:24:01,051 --> 00:24:03,349
Chief among these powers
will be your sight...

144
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:05,581
...your strength, your hearing...

145
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:09,121
...your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed.

146
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:15,121
The early history four universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.

147
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:18,428
Each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through...

148
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:21,500
...contain their own individual law
of space and time.

149
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:24,837
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

150
00:24:58,175 --> 00:24:59,665
-What!
-What was that?

151
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:27,028
Now wouldn’t that beat all get out.
Well, you....

152
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:38,038
Oh, pa !

153
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:39,846
Oh, my.

154
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,643
All these years, as happy as we’ve been...

155
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:19,382
...how I’ve prayed the good Lord
would see fit to give us a child.

156
00:26:21,758 --> 00:26:24,124
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.

157
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:26,018
You take things easy now.

158
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:28,724
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

159
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:37,904
Now the first thing we’ve got to do
when we get home is find out...

160
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:40,540
...who that boy’s proper family is.

161
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:44,313
He hasn’t got any.
Not around here, anyway.

162
00:26:48,785 --> 00:26:51,185
Are you thinking
what I think you are thinking?

163
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:56,085
We could say he’s the child of my cousin
in North Dakota...

164
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,350
...and just now orphaned.

165
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:03,057
Jonathan, he’s only a baby.

166
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:06,896
Martha, now you saw how we found him.

167
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:13,072
Martha Clark Kent,
are you listening to what I’m saying?

168
00:27:46,443 --> 00:27:47,535
Come on, gang.

169
00:27:50,948 --> 00:27:52,813
That was a great game.

170
00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:55,040
All right.

171
00:27:57,254 --> 00:28:00,018
Come on, hustle. Let’s go.
Stack your helmets neatly.

172
00:28:00,657 --> 00:28:03,751
Remember about those uniforms,
cleaned and washed by tomorrow...

173
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:05,727
...and looking like a football team.

174
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:09,296
Clark, let’s have those clothes washed
and ready for tomorrow’s game.

175
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:10,993
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.

176
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:12,866
Can you give me a lift?

177
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:20,507
Lana?

178
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:24,511
Don’t bother with these.
I’ll take them in with the other equipment.

179
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:28,044
-Thank you, Clark.
-Sure.

180
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:32,155
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up
to Mary Ellen’s.

181
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:35,655
play some records.
Would you like to come?

182
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:38,591
Sure.

183
00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:40,720
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

184
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:43,362
Kent can’t make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

185
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:46,864
What are you talking about?
I’ve just finished stacking....

186
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:48,026
All that?

187
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:50,166
Oh, Brad!

188
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:52,741
Hey, come on, Lana.

189
00:28:55,045 --> 00:28:55,977
Let’s go.

190
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:58,947
-He has to clean up.
-’Bye, Clark.

191
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:01,207
-’Bye, Lana.
-Clean this up, Clark.

192
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:05,046
’Bye, Clark.

193
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:12,388
’Bye, Clark.

194
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:15,031
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

195
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:28,736
Mommy, I saw a boy out there
run as fast as the train!

196
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:30,304
Faster even!

197
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:34,669
Lois Lane,
you have a writer’s gift for invention.

198
00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:36,736
-I’ll say that for you.
-But--

199
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:39,208
Lois, please read your book.

200
00:30:40,283 --> 00:30:41,682
No one ever believes me.

201
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,615
Hey, look, there’s Clark!

202
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:19,644
Clark?

203
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:22,316
How did you get here so fast?

204
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,392
I ran.

205
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:25,889
Ran, huh?

206
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:29,065
Told you he was an oddball.
Let’s get out of here.

207
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:38,300
Been showing off a bit, haven’t you, Son?

208
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:53,051
I didn’t mean to show off, pa.

209
00:31:56,827 --> 00:32:00,490
It’s just that guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

210
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:01,588
Yeah, I know.

211
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,066
Yeah, I know I shouldn’t.

212
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,965
Yeah, I know you can do
all these amazing things...

213
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:09,835
...and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust...

214
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,874
...unless you can tell people about it.

215
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,204
-Yeah.
-That’s right.

216
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,279
I mean, every time I get the football
I can make a touchdown.

217
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:18,176
-That’s for sure.
-Every time.

218
00:32:18,515 --> 00:32:22,042
Is it showing off when somebody’s doing
the things he’s capable of doing?

219
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:24,153
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

220
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:26,949
No, no. Now, you listen to me.

221
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:31,491
When you came to us, we thought
people would take you away...

222
00:32:32,162 --> 00:32:34,528
...when they found out
the things that you do.

223
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,595
It worried us a lot.

224
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:39,997
Then when a man gets older
and he thinks very differently.

225
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:42,027
And things get very clear.

226
00:32:42,739 --> 00:32:47,472
And there’s one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

227
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:50,873
I don’t know whose reason,
or whatever the reason is...

228
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:52,505
...maybe it’s because....

229
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:57,779
I don’t know.

230
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:03,718
But I do know one thing.
It’s not to score touchdowns.

231
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,322
Thanks, Dad.

232
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,695
I’ll race you to it. Yeah.

233
00:33:11,968 --> 00:33:12,900
You will?

234
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:15,204
Come on, papa. Run. Come on. Move.

235
00:33:15,438 --> 00:33:18,236
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.

236
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:51,173
Jonathan!

237
00:33:57,514 --> 00:33:58,503
Dad.

238
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,657
All those things I can do...

239
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,504
...all those powers...

240
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:59,932
...and I couldn’t even save him.

241
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:01,891
Clark, get up.

242
00:38:06,362 --> 00:38:08,159
Good morning, Smiley.

243
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:11,592
Clark, breakfast.

244
00:38:15,405 --> 00:38:17,600
Are you going to sleep all day?

245
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:21,706
Clark, come on. Get up.

246
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:24,000
I have to leave.

247
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,439
I knew this time would come.

248
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:36,413
We both knew it
from the day we found you.

249
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:50,389
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.

250
00:39:52,402 --> 00:39:56,566
He said that he’d be happy
to help out from now on.

251
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:06,605
Mother!

252
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:09,443
I know, Son.

253
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:13,044
I know.

254
00:40:17,427 --> 00:40:20,225
Do you know where you’re headed?

255
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:25,823
North.

256
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:33,003
Remember us, Son.

257
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:36,844
Always remember us.

258
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:14,942
My son...

259
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,020
...you do not remember me.

260
00:46:25,628 --> 00:46:26,754
I am Jor-El.

261
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:29,828
I am your father.

262
00:46:32,335 --> 00:46:34,963
By now you will have reached
your eighteenth year...

263
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:37,298
...as it is measured on Earth.

264
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:39,997
By that reckoning...

265
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:44,136
...l will have been dead
for many thousands of your years.

266
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:47,944
The knowledge...

267
00:46:49,218 --> 00:46:52,381
...that I have of matters,
physical and historical...

268
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:56,085
...I have given you fully on your voyage
to your new home.

269
00:46:57,326 --> 00:46:59,487
These are important matters to be sure...

270
00:47:00,363 --> 00:47:02,558
...but still matters of mere fact.

271
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,131
There are questions to be asked...

272
00:47:07,236 --> 00:47:09,864
...and it is time for you to do so.

273
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:14,036
Here, in this...

274
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:18,036
...this fortress of solitude...

275
00:47:19,782 --> 00:47:22,046
...we shall try to find the answers together.

276
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:25,313
So, my son...

277
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:27,586
...speak.

278
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:30,388
Who am l?

279
00:47:31,794 --> 00:47:33,091
Your name is Kal-El.

280
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:37,858
You are the only survivor
of the Planet Krypton.

281
00:47:38,834 --> 00:47:42,793
Even though you were raised
as a human, you are not one of them.

282
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:47,804
You have great powers,
only some of which you have...

283
00:47:48,444 --> 00:47:49,843
...as yet discovered.

284
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:54,407
Come with me now, my son...

285
00:47:54,483 --> 00:47:57,452
...as we break through the bars
of your earthly confinement.

286
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,647
Traveling through time and space.

287
00:48:01,257 --> 00:48:04,988
Your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men.

288
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,824
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

289
00:48:07,963 --> 00:48:11,126
Rather let your leadership stir others to.

290
00:48:13,068 --> 00:48:16,970
In the next year,
we shall examine the human heart.

291
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:20,166
It is more fragile than your own.

292
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:26,370
As we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy...

293
00:48:27,082 --> 00:48:29,607
...we will enter the realm
of the red Krypton sun...

294
00:48:29,685 --> 00:48:32,017
...source of your strength
and nourishment...

295
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:34,621
...and cause of our eventual destruction.

296
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:38,582
The Planet Krypton, my son...

297
00:48:39,462 --> 00:48:41,657
...your home as it was.

298
00:48:43,766 --> 00:48:47,566
This year we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality...

299
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:49,971
...and their basis in actual fact.

300
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,270
The total accumulation of all knowledge
spanning the 28 known galaxies...

301
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:58,941
...is embedded in the crystals
which I have sent along with you.

302
00:48:59,348 --> 00:49:00,975
Study them well, my son.

303
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:07,681
By the time you return to the confines
of your galaxy...

304
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:10,352
...twelve of your years will have passed.

305
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:12,756
For this reason, among others...

306
00:49:13,896 --> 00:49:15,864
...I have chosen Earth for you.

307
00:49:16,131 --> 00:49:18,929
It is now time for you to rejoin
your new world...

308
00:49:19,802 --> 00:49:22,100
...and to serve its collective humanity.

309
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:25,563
Live as one of them, Kal-El...

310
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:29,400
...and discover where your strength
and your power are needed.

311
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:34,509
But always hold in your heart the pride
of your special heritage.

312
00:49:35,885 --> 00:49:38,581
They can be a great people, Kal-El,
they wish to be.

313
00:49:39,655 --> 00:49:41,953
They only lack the light to show the way.

314
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:47,054
For this reason, above all,
their capacity for good...

315
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:50,054
...I have sent them you...

316
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:53,493
...my only son.

317
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:32,500
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.

318
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:36,842
Fresh fruit!
Hey, how about a tomato, lady?

319
00:50:37,446 --> 00:50:39,607
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.

320
00:51:12,014 --> 00:51:12,946
Smile.

321
00:51:15,451 --> 00:51:17,214
How many "T’s" in "bloodletting"?

322
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:18,217
Two.

323
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,091
What are you writing?

324
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:28,459
An ode to spring.
How do you spell "massacre"?

325
00:51:29,498 --> 00:51:33,935
M-a-s-s-a-c-r-e.

326
00:51:34,603 --> 00:51:35,627
Thanks.

327
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:38,396
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

328
00:51:38,474 --> 00:51:40,635
A good reporter doesn’t get great stories.

329
00:51:40,709 --> 00:51:42,176
A good reporter makes them great.

330
00:51:42,244 --> 00:51:44,337
Chief, here’s that story on the murder case.

331
00:51:44,413 --> 00:51:47,746
The way I see it, it’s a headline
on the front page with my picture--

332
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:51,377
There’s only one "p" in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

333
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,310
Hello, Miss Lane, how are--

334
00:51:57,726 --> 00:51:59,887
How are you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

335
00:51:59,962 --> 00:52:01,793
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.

336
00:52:03,365 --> 00:52:05,959
It’s got everything:
sex, violence, the ethnic angle.

337
00:52:06,235 --> 00:52:08,635
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

338
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:10,865
-Kent, can you open this?
-Sure, Mr. White.

339
00:52:10,939 --> 00:52:13,203
This could be the basis
for a series of articles:

340
00:52:13,275 --> 00:52:16,039
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings"
by Lois Lane.

341
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:18,973
We get psychologists,
sociologists, interviews....

342
00:52:19,048 --> 00:52:22,506
Lois, you’re pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

343
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:24,876
The Daily Planet has a tradition....

344
00:52:24,953 --> 00:52:26,420
Oh, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

345
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:29,323
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean
to shake it up like that.

346
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:31,222
Of course not, Lois.

347
00:52:31,827 --> 00:52:34,955
Why would any one want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

348
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:38,257
I’ll take that.

349
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,198
Thanks. I’m sorry, Mr. White.

350
00:52:40,269 --> 00:52:43,830
Why do I pay you $40 a week when
I should have you arrested for loitering?

351
00:52:43,906 --> 00:52:45,430
-Go get Mr... a towel.
-Kent.

352
00:52:45,507 --> 00:52:46,997
-Move, kid, move.
-Right, Chief.

353
00:52:47,076 --> 00:52:49,135
-Make mine black, no sugar.
-Right, Chief.

354
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:50,678
And don’t call me sugar.

355
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:53,743
Right.... Sugar.

356
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:56,611
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I’ll take tea with lemon.

357
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,153
Lois, why don’t you take Kent out
to meet everybody, huh?

358
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:04,124
Just introduce him around.
He’s starting on the paper today.

359
00:53:04,326 --> 00:53:05,918
I’m giving him the City beat.

360
00:53:06,695 --> 00:53:07,491
Chief!

361
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,697
That’s my beat!

362
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:13,728
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like
just a mild-mannered reporter...

363
00:53:13,936 --> 00:53:17,997
...but not only does he know how to treat
his Chief with the proper respect...

364
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:20,803
...not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style...

365
00:53:20,876 --> 00:53:24,869
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business,
the fastest typist I have ever seen.

366
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:25,936
That’s great.

367
00:53:26,715 --> 00:53:28,444
Here, you forgot my article.

368
00:53:32,154 --> 00:53:34,418
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...

369
00:53:34,523 --> 00:53:36,923
...if you could arrange for half my salary...

370
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:39,526
...to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

371
00:53:39,995 --> 00:53:40,825
Your bookie, right?

372
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:41,691
My what?

373
00:53:41,797 --> 00:53:42,786
Don’t tell me!

374
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:45,800
He sends a check every week
to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

375
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,595
Actually, she’s silver-haired.

376
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:51,305
I’ll see what I can do.

377
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,837
Thank you very much, Mr. White.

378
00:53:58,313 --> 00:53:59,007
Well?

379
00:54:01,016 --> 00:54:02,483
Any more at home like you?

380
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:04,411
Not really, no.

381
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:08,853
I didn’t think so.

382
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:12,757
Well, get yourself a desk over here.

383
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:14,518
Over here?

384
00:54:14,596 --> 00:54:17,360
Here, there’s some paper
and a file right there.

385
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:18,465
Sorry.

386
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:38,181
-Hi, Bill Breesen.
-Hi, Clark Kent.

387
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:40,585
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome aboard.

388
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:44,586
-Here’s your towel, Mr. Clark.
-Kent.

389
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,684
-What?
-Kent.

390
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:48,662
-Clark Kent.
-Jimmy Olsen.

391
00:54:54,937 --> 00:54:57,906
-I met this really great guy, you know.
-Hey, fabulous.

392
00:54:57,973 --> 00:55:01,409
We had this fabulous weekend.
I met him at this dude ranch.

393
00:55:01,476 --> 00:55:03,103
I haven’t been since I was seven.

394
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:06,045
-I got to mail these letters.
-Good luck tonight.

395
00:55:06,114 --> 00:55:07,604
-Hi, Clark.
-Hi, Lois.

396
00:55:07,683 --> 00:55:10,117
How did you like your first day on the job?

397
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:13,413
The hours were sort of longer
than I expected...

398
00:55:13,488 --> 00:55:16,753
...but on the whole, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White....

399
00:55:16,825 --> 00:55:18,986
Gosh, on a whole, I’d say it’s been swell.

400
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:20,426
-"Swell"?
-Yup.

401
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:23,524
You know, Clark...

402
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,334
...there are very few people left
in the world...

403
00:55:27,402 --> 00:55:29,461
...who feel comfortable saying that word.

404
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:30,800
-What word?
-Swell.

405
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:33,398
Really? I always thought
it was kind of natural.

406
00:55:35,644 --> 00:55:37,339
-Sorry.
-Clark.

407
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,641
-Sorry, Lois.
-Hi, Rex.

408
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:45,918
-Did you see anything good today?
-Not until you came along.

409
00:55:46,188 --> 00:55:47,280
Rex, this is....

410
00:55:47,356 --> 00:55:49,324
-Clark Kent. How do--
-See you around.

411
00:55:51,593 --> 00:55:52,457
Lois?

412
00:55:53,495 --> 00:55:54,826
Hey, where you going?

413
00:55:54,897 --> 00:55:56,296
Can I help you with your coat?

414
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:58,162
-Thanks. Can you get that?
-Sure.

415
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,632
Did you like Mr. White?

416
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:01,965
He was a nice guy
and Jimmy was fantastic.

417
00:56:02,804 --> 00:56:04,567
Come here. Come on.

418
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,232
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.

419
00:56:06,308 --> 00:56:09,539
-We’d better get out of here.
-We’d better do what he says, Lois.

420
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:11,335
Come on, get in here, quick.

421
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:14,314
Don’t, don’t do anything.
It’s all right, I’m coming.

422
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,678
We’re coming.

423
00:56:15,851 --> 00:56:16,875
Excuse me.

424
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:18,344
-Here?
-Yeah, yeah.

425
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,446
Don’t point that at me, sir.
You could hurt somebody with that.

426
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:24,350
Okay, okay. Hold it there.

427
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:25,582
Just a minute.

428
00:56:25,861 --> 00:56:27,123
Now I realize that...

429
00:56:27,195 --> 00:56:30,494
...times are tough for some these days,
but this isn’t the answer.

430
00:56:30,565 --> 00:56:33,932
You can’t solve society’s problems
with a gun.

431
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:36,595
You know, buddy, you’re right.

432
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:40,534
-I’m going to turn over a new leaf.
-Good for you, sir. That’s the spirit.

433
00:56:40,642 --> 00:56:42,667
He doesn’t really want to hurt anyone.

434
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:45,672
Right after I rip off this lady’s purse.

435
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:46,611
Of course!

436
00:56:47,015 --> 00:56:48,710
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

437
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,085
Lois, I think you’d better....

438
00:56:55,557 --> 00:56:57,149
Lois! What are you doing?

439
00:57:15,544 --> 00:57:16,943
Are you all right?

440
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,038
What happened?

441
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:23,179
-Golly, I guess I must have fainted.
-Fainted?

442
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,082
-You fainted!
-I’m sorry.

443
00:57:40,035 --> 00:57:42,503
Really, Lois,
supposing that man had shot you?

444
00:57:42,571 --> 00:57:44,630
Is it worth risking your life over $10...

445
00:57:44,706 --> 00:57:47,072
...two credit cards,
a hairbrush and a lipstick?

446
00:57:47,909 --> 00:57:49,706
-How did you know that?
-Know what?

447
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,812
You described the exact contents
of my purse.

448
00:57:58,186 --> 00:57:59,084
Wild guess.

449
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:03,821
Taxi!

450
00:58:08,764 --> 00:58:10,129
-Hey!
-Hi, Otis.

451
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:23,204
So, what’s happening, partner?

452
00:58:23,412 --> 00:58:24,606
Look what we got.

453
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,238
Let’s take him.

454
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:27,915
Wait a minute.

455
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:30,247
Maybe he’ll lead us to the big man himself.

456
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:31,608
Lex Luthor?

457
00:58:31,987 --> 00:58:33,249
You got it, Aramus.

458
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:36,320
We’ll make Captain by midnight.

459
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:42,159
Hey, what do you read?
XK-101 rocket to be used.

460
00:58:43,065 --> 00:58:44,532
Hey, what do you read?

461
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,629
-Hey, Matt.
-Hi, Otis.

462
00:58:46,701 --> 00:58:48,601
Just getting a Daily Planet here.

463
00:58:54,643 --> 00:58:56,076
Okay. All right.

464
00:58:56,611 --> 00:58:58,943
See, I’m paying him,
and I got a pretzel, too.

465
00:58:59,014 --> 00:59:00,106
Thanks, Otis.

466
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:02,246
How many bags, Shutzy?

467
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:07,813
This is Metropolis 46. We’re on foot.
Over and out.

468
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,022
Let’s go.

469
00:59:14,096 --> 00:59:16,428
Your attention, please.

470
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:18,295
Your attention, please.

471
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,665
The Metropolis Flyer is now ready
for departure...

472
00:59:22,037 --> 00:59:24,699
...on the upper level. Track 6.

473
00:59:26,575 --> 00:59:29,738
He’s going down on a train platform.
I’m going after him.

474
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:32,439
Okay, I’ll call for backup.
Be careful now, will you?

475
00:59:32,514 --> 00:59:34,209
All right, Aramus. All right.

476
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:38,548
Now boarding on the lower level....

477
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:43,820
Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars,
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie....

478
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:45,683
Board now. All aboard.

479
00:59:45,994 --> 00:59:49,521
Metropolis Transportation
to Buffalo, Syracuse....

480
00:59:50,565 --> 00:59:53,125
Smoking cars are forward,
move along now.

481
00:59:53,735 --> 00:59:54,997
Luggage at the top.

482
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:58,496
Smoking cars are forward.
All aboard, boarding.

483
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:28,834
Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22.

484
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:32,536
I’ve seen him and I’m right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.

485
01:01:09,644 --> 01:01:10,906
So that’s it!

486
01:01:27,128 --> 01:01:30,825
It’s amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

487
01:02:12,974 --> 01:02:13,770
Harry....

488
01:02:16,378 --> 01:02:18,539
Harry, where are you? Harry?

489
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:39,661
Sick!

490
01:02:48,877 --> 01:02:50,504
Sick, you’re really sick!

491
01:02:51,379 --> 01:02:52,937
I’m sick, Ms. Teschmacher?

492
01:02:53,081 --> 01:02:56,107
Sick when we’re days
from executing the crime of the century?

493
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:58,983
No, no, no. Step away from that, please.

494
01:03:00,588 --> 01:03:04,217
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

495
01:03:04,726 --> 01:03:06,523
Do you tell me that I’m brilliant?

496
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:09,620
Oh, no, that would be too obvious,
I grant you.

497
01:03:09,864 --> 01:03:10,831
Charismatic?

498
01:03:11,433 --> 01:03:12,730
Fiendishly gifted?

499
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:15,402
Try twisted!

500
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:23,302
Get away from that, get away!

501
01:03:25,413 --> 01:03:26,880
Tell me, Lex.

502
01:03:27,048 --> 01:03:30,074
Why do so many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

503
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:31,448
Why? You ask why?

504
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:34,920
Why does the phone always ring
when you’re in the bathtub?

505
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:39,690
Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader
of our time...

506
01:03:40,395 --> 01:03:42,693
...surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

507
01:03:42,764 --> 01:03:44,061
I’m back, Mr. Luthor.

508
01:03:44,766 --> 01:03:46,734
I was just talking about you.

509
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:49,236
You were followed again.

510
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:55,642
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.

511
01:04:00,615 --> 01:04:02,412
Mr. Luthor, I’m sorry.

512
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:06,987
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

513
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:08,988
Yes.

514
01:04:09,924 --> 01:04:11,551
Then why am I not reading it?

515
01:04:13,461 --> 01:04:15,429
Because I haven’t given it to you yet?

516
01:04:15,764 --> 01:04:16,560
Right.

517
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,067
At last it’s official.

518
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:26,300
Thanks to the help of the US Government...

519
01:04:26,374 --> 01:04:30,174
...we are about to be involved in
the greatest real-estate swindle of all time.

520
01:04:30,512 --> 01:04:31,809
Lex, what is this...

521
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,008
...obsession with real estate?
All the time, "land, land, land."

522
01:04:35,316 --> 01:04:38,183
When I was 6 years old,
my father said to me--

523
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:39,183
"Get out! "

524
01:04:40,989 --> 01:04:44,618
Before that, he said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall...

525
01:04:44,692 --> 01:04:47,525
"...utilities and transportation systems
may collapse...

526
01:04:47,595 --> 01:04:50,689
"...people are no damn good,
but they’ll always need land...

527
01:04:50,765 --> 01:04:53,097
"...they’ll pay through the nose to get it."

528
01:04:53,168 --> 01:04:55,398
-"Remember," my father said--
-"Land."

529
01:04:58,706 --> 01:05:01,072
It’s a pity that he didn’t see...

530
01:05:01,142 --> 01:05:04,077
...from such humble beginnings
how I’ve created this empire.

531
01:05:04,145 --> 01:05:05,442
An empire. This?

532
01:05:06,714 --> 01:05:11,344
How many girls do you know
have a park Avenue address like this?

533
01:05:12,053 --> 01:05:15,181
park Avenue address, 200 feet below?

534
01:05:15,523 --> 01:05:18,185
Do you realize
what people are shelling out up there...

535
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,054
...for a few miserable rooms
off a common elevator.

536
01:05:21,629 --> 01:05:23,563
What more could anyone ask?

537
01:05:31,673 --> 01:05:34,642
Get this Loch Ness update
right into composing.

538
01:05:35,043 --> 01:05:38,171
Yeah. No, that’s it, Roth.
put it to bed. Right.

539
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:41,244
-Why are you standing here for?
-I’m not.

540
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:43,777
-I wasn’t going to say it.
-Go.

541
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:50,858
The sex maniac profile.

542
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:54,324
Right. Nine to five it’s
a Pulitzer prize winner. What do you bet?

543
01:05:54,395 --> 01:05:56,022
There’s no "Z" in "brassiere."

544
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:58,529
Nice job on that union scandal, Kent.

545
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,232
Gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

546
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:06,337
Hi, Clark. Good night.

547
01:06:06,407 --> 01:06:09,205
-Here, let me carry that for you.
-Thanks a lot.

548
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:11,378
Lois, have you got a minute?

549
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,006
Excuse me, please.

550
01:06:14,282 --> 01:06:17,649
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, okay?

551
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,784
I was wondering
if you’d have dinner with me?

552
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:22,789
I’m sorry, I’m booked.

553
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:27,325
Air Force One is landing at the airport.
This kid'll be there to make sure...

554
01:06:27,395 --> 01:06:30,455
...you-know-who answers the questions
he would rather duck.

555
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:31,897
Don’t you ever let up?

556
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:35,034
What for? I mean I’ve seen
how the other half lives.

557
01:06:35,136 --> 01:06:38,970
My sister, for instance.
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.

558
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,372
I would go bananas in a week.

559
01:06:41,509 --> 01:06:44,307
-Can I take you to the airport?
-Not unless you can fly.

560
01:06:47,582 --> 01:06:50,346
"Ladies." I have to change, thank you.
Goodbye.

561
01:06:50,418 --> 01:06:51,612
Maybe we could--

562
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:02,161
-Would you mail that for me? Thanks.
-Sure.

563
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:03,386
Good night.

564
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:11,402
Going down, please, going down.

565
01:07:14,776 --> 01:07:15,834
Going down?

566
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,275
Going up. Up, up.

567
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:20,236
Good night.

568
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,521
Daily planet, Copter One. This is ground.

569
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:35,961
Planet One, go ahead.

570
01:07:36,164 --> 01:07:40,533
Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport
to meet Air Force One. It’s a hurry flight.

571
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:44,996
We ’re on our way over the river.
Have one aboard for transfer. Over.

572
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:50,141
Roger, Planet One. You’re clear to land.
Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9.

573
01:07:50,511 --> 01:07:51,808
Roger, Over and out.

574
01:08:53,074 --> 01:08:54,666
A malfunction, can’t get lift off.

575
01:08:54,742 --> 01:08:57,210
-You’ve hooked a cable.
-What’s happening?

576
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,804
Set it down.

577
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:01,678
My God, we’ve lost motor control.

578
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:02,841
I can’t hold it.

579
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:10,616
I can’t hold it.

580
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,027
He’s lost it.

581
01:09:27,809 --> 01:09:28,707
Wake up.

582
01:09:31,879 --> 01:09:33,506
Help!

583
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:53,430
Step back, folks.

584
01:09:54,168 --> 01:09:56,728
Get back. Move over
to the other side of the street.

585
01:09:59,707 --> 01:10:02,540
Bring the canvas here. Get it up there.

586
01:10:02,777 --> 01:10:04,335
There’s helicopter up there.

587
01:10:10,718 --> 01:10:11,776
Help me.

588
01:10:20,628 --> 01:10:22,994
All right, folks. Let’s move back.

589
01:10:23,965 --> 01:10:25,592
Let these firemen get in here.

590
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:29,198
Help me!

591
01:10:35,476 --> 01:10:36,773
Hold it. Get back.

592
01:10:40,848 --> 01:10:42,839
Get off the street, folks.

593
01:10:57,365 --> 01:11:00,664
All right, get along there.
Get away from the side of the building.

594
01:11:03,404 --> 01:11:05,531
Hold these crowds back. Move.

595
01:11:08,075 --> 01:11:08,871
Help!

596
01:11:25,526 --> 01:11:26,493
Say, Jim....

597
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:27,991
Excuse me.

598
01:11:28,062 --> 01:11:29,529
That’s a bad outfit.

599
01:11:31,232 --> 01:11:32,699
Okay, move these people.

600
01:11:42,543 --> 01:11:44,010
Oh, my God! Look up there.

601
01:11:46,013 --> 01:11:47,275
What the hell’s that?

602
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:50,941
Easy, miss. I’ve got you.

603
01:11:51,052 --> 01:11:54,021
You’ve got me? Who’s got you?

604
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:59,749
I can’t believe it, I just cannot believe it.
He got her.

605
01:12:44,572 --> 01:12:46,597
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

606
01:12:48,576 --> 01:12:51,602
I hope this little incident
hasn’t put you off flying, miss.

607
01:12:53,347 --> 01:12:56,783
Statistically speaking, of course,
it’s still the safest way to travel.

608
01:12:57,985 --> 01:12:58,781
Right.

609
01:12:59,854 --> 01:13:00,843
Wait!

610
01:13:05,526 --> 01:13:06,652
Who are you?

611
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:08,562
A friend.

612
01:13:13,901 --> 01:13:14,890
’Bye.

613
01:14:28,409 --> 01:14:30,240
Something wrong with the elevator?

614
01:14:37,718 --> 01:14:38,650
Going down?

615
01:14:51,432 --> 01:14:52,330
Officer.

616
01:14:55,736 --> 01:14:58,068
Good evening, Officer Mooney.

617
01:14:58,806 --> 01:15:00,933
They say confession is good for the soul.

618
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:05,779
I’d listen to this man. Take him away.

619
01:15:51,826 --> 01:15:53,521
Come on, let’s get out of here.

620
01:16:04,071 --> 01:16:05,538
Move your ass! Come on!

621
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,967
Okay, let’s go. Let’s go.

622
01:16:08,676 --> 01:16:11,474
Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons.

623
01:16:11,712 --> 01:16:14,340
Bullshit! Come on, let’s get out of here.

624
01:16:14,548 --> 01:16:16,516
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.

625
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:18,182
Okay, freeze, you turkeys.

626
01:16:18,252 --> 01:16:20,379
-Don’t shoot!
-Keep your cool. You got us.

627
01:16:45,112 --> 01:16:46,238
Bad vibrations?

628
01:16:46,914 --> 01:16:50,042
Sergeant, you don’t believe me.
I swear it, flying.

629
01:16:50,518 --> 01:16:53,043
With a big red cape
and bright red boots as well.

630
01:16:53,521 --> 01:16:57,821
Quick as a wink he was gone. He flew up
in the air again, he did, like a big blue bird.

631
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,059
-A big blue bird?
-You don’t believe me!

632
01:17:00,127 --> 01:17:01,526
With bright red boots?

633
01:17:01,762 --> 01:17:02,956
Take the night off.

634
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:05,658
Go back to Murphy’s bar
and continue what you started.

635
01:17:05,933 --> 01:17:08,868
I’ll be off in a few minutes
and I’ll meet you there.

636
01:17:20,014 --> 01:17:22,414
The first bottle’s on me.
Let me get my hat.

637
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:35,791
Frisky, will you come down from there.

638
01:17:38,065 --> 01:17:39,532
Hi. I’ll get him.

639
01:17:44,572 --> 01:17:46,164
Come on, it’s all right.

640
01:17:47,775 --> 01:17:50,642
-Here you go, miss.
-Gee, thanks, mister.

641
01:17:53,247 --> 01:17:55,272
Goodbye, Frisky. So long now.

642
01:17:58,953 --> 01:17:59,749
’Bye.

643
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,918
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.

644
01:18:06,126 --> 01:18:08,924
Then this man swooped out of the sky
and gave him to me.

645
01:18:09,196 --> 01:18:11,960
Haven’t I told you to stop telling lies.

646
01:18:17,004 --> 01:18:20,963
Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One.
Could we have the latest weather report?

647
01:18:21,175 --> 01:18:25,077
Metropolis currently ceiling 500,
overcast 700 broken...

648
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:29,409
... visibility one half in showers.
Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8.

649
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:30,413
Roger.

650
01:18:31,885 --> 01:18:33,785
Doesn’t look good. What do you think?

651
01:18:35,489 --> 01:18:38,856
-What the hell was that?
-You’ve lost power in number one.

652
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:40,984
Lost power? We’ve lost the whole engine.

653
01:18:41,495 --> 01:18:43,588
-pressure’s going.
-Shut down number one.

654
01:18:43,664 --> 01:18:44,756
Bring up two and three.

655
01:18:44,832 --> 01:18:47,130
We haven’t got enough pressure
to keep going.

656
01:18:48,702 --> 01:18:52,001
Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.

657
01:18:52,306 --> 01:18:55,275
We have lost port outboard engine
and part of wing.

658
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:58,375
Request emergency landing.
What’s the position?

659
01:18:58,512 --> 01:19:00,673
Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.

660
01:19:00,748 --> 01:19:02,306
Notify them the president’s on board.

661
01:19:02,383 --> 01:19:06,251
present position 10 miles, that’s 10 miles
southwest of Metropolis Airport.

662
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,756
Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet.

663
01:19:29,343 --> 01:19:31,777
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?

664
01:19:32,146 --> 01:19:34,080
What the hell’s going on out there?

665
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:37,409
Fly, don’t look, just fly.

666
01:19:37,785 --> 01:19:39,309
We got something.

667
01:19:40,054 --> 01:19:43,319
I’m not saying what it is, just trust me.

668
01:19:55,871 --> 01:19:57,702
You enjoyed it.

669
01:20:01,476 --> 01:20:03,341
I don’t know what to say, Father.

670
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:05,442
I am afraid just got carried away.

671
01:20:06,548 --> 01:20:09,312
-I anticipated this, my son.
-You couldn’t have.

672
01:20:10,519 --> 01:20:12,180
You couldn’t have imagined....

673
01:20:13,589 --> 01:20:14,851
How good it felt?

674
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:19,320
You are revealed to the world.

675
01:20:21,496 --> 01:20:22,463
Very well.

676
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:24,060
So be it.

677
01:20:25,467 --> 01:20:28,095
But you still must keep
your secret identity.

678
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:29,759
Why?

679
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:31,701
The reasons are two.

680
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:35,576
First.: You cannot serve humanity
28hours a day.

681
01:20:37,145 --> 01:20:38,703
24.

682
01:20:40,115 --> 01:20:41,514
As it is, it won’t happen.

683
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:45,978
Your help will be called for endlessly.

684
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:49,455
Even for those tasks that human beings
can solve themselves.

685
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:53,561
They’re happy to abuse the resources
of the world.

686
01:20:54,096 --> 01:20:55,154
And secondly?

687
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,219
Secondly.:

688
01:20:56,632 --> 01:20:58,259
Your enemies will discover...

689
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:01,164
...their only way to hurt you...

690
01:21:01,603 --> 01:21:03,594
...by hurting the people you care for.

691
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:06,232
Thank you, Father.

692
01:21:06,575 --> 01:21:07,564
Lastly.:

693
01:21:10,278 --> 01:21:12,803
Do not punish yourself
with your feelings of vanity.

694
01:21:13,548 --> 01:21:15,209
Simply learn to control them.

695
01:21:15,684 --> 01:21:18,551
It is an affliction common to all,
even on Krypton.

696
01:21:19,554 --> 01:21:22,887
Our destruction could have been avoided
but for the vanity of some...

697
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:25,449
...who considered us indestructible.

698
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:27,918
Were it not for vanity...

699
01:21:29,564 --> 01:21:31,259
...at this very moment...

700
01:21:35,604 --> 01:21:37,834
...l could embrace you in my arms...

701
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:43,443
...my son.

702
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:18,170
Reports are coming in
of a miraculous saving of Air Force One...

703
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:20,747
...from almost certain destruction.

704
01:22:21,183 --> 01:22:25,313
Rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter
from the Daily planet, with one hand...

705
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:28,785
...and a crashed helicopter with the other.

706
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:33,185
That’ll be the day.

707
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:37,024
That’ll be the day when a guy could fly.

708
01:22:37,866 --> 01:22:40,198
I don’t know. You would be surprised.

709
01:22:42,704 --> 01:22:44,365
Some sort of fantastic hoax.

710
01:22:45,073 --> 01:22:47,541
Your guess is as good as anybody’s.
True or false?

711
01:22:47,609 --> 01:22:49,702
Miracle or fraud? The answer--

712
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:51,506
-Miss Teschmacher!
-Man or myth?

713
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,272
Turn it off.
