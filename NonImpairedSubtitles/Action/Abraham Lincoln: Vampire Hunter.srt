1
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,080
Thy name shall be Abraham, for I will
make thee a father of many nations.

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,680
The Book of Genesis, Chapter 17, verse 5.

3
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,080
<i>History prefers legends to men.</i>

4
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,320
<i>It prefers nobility, to brutality.</i>

5
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,320
<i>Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.</i>

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,520
<i>History remembers the
battle, and forgets the blood.</i>

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,000
<i>Whatever history remembers of me,
if it remembers anything at all...</i>

8
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:25,365
<i>It shall only be a fraction of the truth.</i>

9
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,965
<i>For whatever else I am, a
husband, a lawyer, a president...</i>

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
<i>I shall always think of myself as a
man who struggled against darkness.</i>

11
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,400
<i>I leave in your trusted
hands, my dear friend Henry,</i>

12
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:51,280
<i>this record that begins
when I was just a boy.</i>

13
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,965
Come on there, hurry up!
Get them down there, let's go!

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,480
Please sir, no! It's some kind
of a mistake, I ain't no slave.

15
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,120
No! Let them go!
- Go back inside!

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,365
Will! - Be quiet!
- He's my friend!

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,480
Look away Abraham, it's
not our place. Look away.

18
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,800
Oh my God! Abraham!

19
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Are you alright?

20
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,780
Did you strike my friend here?
- He was beating my son!

21
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,280
Did you strike him, Lincoln?
- They're not slaves, and you know it.

22
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,720
I suggest you get back to your work before
you find yourself led away in chains.

23
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:04,285
Until every man is free, we are all slaves.

24
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,460
Very well then. Since y'all
are so concerned with freedom,

25
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:12,007
you may consider yourself free
from the burden of my employ.

26
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:15,520
Come on, let's go.
- And the debt you've been working off,

27
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:21,520
I'd like it paid in full,
with interests. Now please.

28
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,080
If you get one more
penny from me, Mr. Barts,

29
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,120
it will come with a fist wrapped around it.

30
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,965
Alright Mr. Lincoln.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There are other ways to collect a debt.

32
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,000
What's happening to her
father?! Please, help her!

33
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:54,080
You got to do something, father!

34
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,280
Easy child.
- Look away Abraham.

35
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I've never seen anything
like this. Strange.

36
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:08,800
Promise me...

37
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,600
Let's step outside.

38
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Abraham, come and lay next to me.

39
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,400
I've been writing, mama.

40
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,880
Days are swift as an indian arrow.

41
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,480
Flying like a shooting star.

42
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,360
The present day is here.

43
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:57,857
Then slides away in haste.

44
00:05:57,892 --> 00:06:02,320
That we can never say is ours.

45
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:08,600
But only say is past.

46
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,520
Mother?

47
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,280
<i>Mama once told me that I
hadn't cried when I was born.</i>

48
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,720
<i>That I simply opened my eyes,
looked at her smiling face,</i>

49
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:37,165
<i>and smiled back. My light was gone.</i>

50
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,280
I don't know how he did it...
- Abraham, you promised me.

51
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,520
You promised me you won't
go and do nothing foolish.

52
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,920
<i>Nine years later, my
father joined her in death.</i>

53
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:58,840
<i>No longer bound by my
promise, I tried to fortify</i>

54
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,720
<i>the nerve to pursue my vengeance.</i>

55
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,800
Haven't you had enough?

56
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,480
A boy only gets this drunk
when he wants to kiss a girl,

57
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,800
or kill a man.

58
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,685
Adam, let me explain.
- Last one Barts.

59
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,480
I'm not coming up here to
clean up your messes any more.

60
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,365
So, where's Henry?

61
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Ah yes, we've been looking all
over sir, searching high and low.

62
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:57,680
Low is more likely. Just find him Barts.

63
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,080
Oh and, send a fresh crop south,
we have a lot of mouths to feed.

64
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,600
Yes sir.

65
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,800
For my mother.

66
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,320
Well that was unlucky. Might
have put me out of my misery.

67
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:55,920
Where the hell are you running to?!

68
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,565
Nobody likes chasing chickens.

69
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Little boy all grown up,
come to avenge his dear mama.

70
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,965
There are 2 kinds of men Mr. Lincoln,

71
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,200
those that have the guts to pull
the trigger, and those who do not.

72
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,200
Powder, patch, ball, don't mess it up.

73
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:22,720
You weren't asleep that night, were you?

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,700
You dropped the ball Mr. Lincoln.

75
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,400
Your mama's blood was sickly sweet.

76
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:36,720
Hope yours taste better!

77
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,920
Might I suggest that we
begin by, closing the door?

78
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:21,680
Yes, I'm sorry.

79
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,800
I didn't see anything.

80
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,680
Can we dive right in?

81
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,280
Or are you finding
Gabrielle too distracting?

82
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,365
I'm sorry sir but, who are you?

83
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,200
Who I am is Henry Sturges,
where you are is my home.

84
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:50,365
What has happened...

85
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,520
I saved your life, during your more than
pathetic attempt of taking another's.

86
00:12:55,555 --> 00:13:00,000
What were you doing there and how
did you know I tried to kill Barts?

87
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,565
How? I watched boy carry out
his first long awaited mission,

88
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,480
drunk might I add, and I think you've
waisted your time on this one Henry.

89
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,480
He's not a promising recruit, he is just a

90
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,480
selfish boy with his
heart set on vengeance.

91
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,400
You did not realize that
his boy is a goddamn idiot!

92
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,700
I doubt he even knew
his target was a vampire.

93
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:37,365
A vampire?
- Yes, immortal, bloodsucking demons.

94
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,800
Fortunately for you Mr. Lincoln,
hunting them is something of a hobby.

95
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:45,280
Vampires are just myths.
- Myths don't beat you senseless

96
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,880
after you put a bullet
in their brain. Thank you.

97
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,600
No Mr. Lincoln, vampires are
real, they exist in every city,

98
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:58,000
in every state, in the Union.

99
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,280
If what you say is true,
you could help me kill him,

100
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,000
I could pay you to kill him.
- My services are not for sale.

101
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:07,085
And word you are looking
for is "destroyed",

102
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,000
it is quite a feat to kill
that which is already dead.

103
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,400
But you don't understand,
my mother was murdered.

104
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,480
And if I teach you how
to murder her murderer,

105
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,600
so what? How will that honor her memory?

106
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,200
How will that benefit the
next boy whose mother is taken?

107
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:37,520
If vengeance is all you
seek, seek it elsewhere.

108
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,680
Teach me to fight as you do,
please, I'll do anything you say.

109
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,600
You promise to cast aside
all notions of vengeance?

110
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:48,117
And commit to the life of a hunter?

111
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:51,600
You will have no friends, no family.

112
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,680
<i>I told him what he wanted to
hear, but all I cared about</i>

113
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:59,000
<i>was killing the monster
that took my mother.</i>

114
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm in.

115
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,400
Clearly you don't hate him that much.

116
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:12,765
Tell me what you hate.

117
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
I hate that my mother was taken away.

118
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,480
Inadequate.
- I hate that we were afraid.

119
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,480
And? - That my mother, father,
everyone that we knew lived in fear.

120
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,280
Pathetic.
- I hate that I was too small.

121
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,485
Too weak.
- Yes.

122
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,800
And that you failed, to protect her.
- Yes!

123
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:38,600
And that you let her die.

124
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,080
Power Lincoln, real power

125
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,080
comes not from hate, but from truth.

126
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,200
Before you can protect others from darkness,
you must first be able to protect yourself.

127
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,920
Your enemies have the power
to render themselves invisible.

128
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:16,720
You must have the ability to
fight blind, to see without seeing.

129
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,400
Again.

130
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,085
<i>In the weeks that
followed, Henry endeavored</i>

131
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,365
<i>to impart a lifetime of
vampire hunting secrets.</i>

132
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,400
<i>Their ability to adapt to sunlight, the
power to render themselves invisible.</i>

133
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:13,285
<i>But most of all, he taught
me how to destroy them.</i>

134
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,480
When Judas betrayed Jesus, his
reward was 30 pieces of silver.

135
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,800
At that moment those pieces became
the symbol of betraying God, of evil.

136
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:28,320
And silver became a curse, upon the cursed.

137
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,400
You'll never see a vampire
with silver on his person.

138
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,080
You'll not see them reflected in mirrors.

139
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,680
The one thing God placed
beyond the reach of a vampire.

140
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,320
The one thing he can never poses, and
the only thing that renders him powerless.

141
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,285
Henry it's Jack Barts...

142
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,800
I give you the targets, that was our deal.

143
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:55,200
This is not only about Jack Barts.

144
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,485
Vadoma, ruthless enforcer.

145
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,680
And her brother.
- Wait, I've seen him before,

146
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,520
I saw him with Jack Barts.
- They call him Adam.

147
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,965
He from whom all others are made.

148
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,200
Vampires have been in the
new world for centuries.

149
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,240
Slaughtering native
tribes, and early settlers.

150
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:24,400
But when the Europeans
arrived with their slaves,

151
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:28,600
the dead saw a sinister opportunity.

152
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,080
They built an empire in the south.

153
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,600
In recent years they pressed
north, leaving death in their wake.

154
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:42,165
It falls to us Abraham, the hunters,

155
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,320
to keep the balance, to ensure
that this remains a nation of men.

156
00:18:48,355 --> 00:18:50,365
And not monsters.

157
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,320
What we do, we do not for one man,
but for the good of all mankind.

158
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,680
<i>Henry sent me off into
the world with a reminder.</i>

159
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,680
<i>No attachments, no distractions,
no friends or family.</i>

160
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,960
<i>Besides, who could I
trust? Anyone in this well</i>

161
00:19:08,995 --> 00:19:12,200
<i>mannered city might
very well be one of them.</i>

162
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:15,320
You son of a bitch!

163
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,800
If I ever see you here again I will
have your balls as a coin purse!

164
00:19:23,835 --> 00:19:27,200
I will get you! I'll get you some day!

165
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,000
Good afternoon sir, Joshua
Speed at your service.

166
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:40,565
Abraham, Lincoln.

167
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,485
I need a bit of help.
- Alright.

168
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,600
A friend in need, is a friend
of Speed, what can I get for you?

169
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:50,680
I don't suppose you know of
any rooms for rent, Mr. Speed?

170
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,865
What sort of a room are you
looking for, Mr. Lincoln?

171
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,400
Cheap one, as I've spent all of my money on
law books have none to spare at the moment.

172
00:19:56,435 --> 00:20:00,880
As you say you have none, am I to take
your meaning as cheap or free of charge?

173
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,200
On credit. - All the same, I don't think
you'll find such a room in Springfield,

174
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:07,920
people here are strangely
accustomed of being compensated.

175
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,800
Good day.

176
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,365
There is one room, Mr. Lincoln.

177
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,320
I was recently forced to part ways
with a thieving prick of an associate,

178
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:31,565
and am therefor in need of a replacement.

179
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,800
There's a room upstairs, it isn't much
but, I suppose it could be had on credit.

180
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:41,165
If you intend or are willing
to work here in return.

181
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,165
<i>Dear Henry, life in Springfield
is less than desirous.</i>

182
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,400
<i>Fear not, my pittance of a salary doesn't
allow me to deviate from your rules.</i>

183
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:53,565
<i>No friends, no family.</i>

184
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,120
<i>And certainly no woman would
find me and my existence enticing.</i>

185
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,400
Excuse me?

186
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,485
Excuse me, I'll be needing these.
- Just one second ma'am.

187
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,000
Well, you needn't call me ma'am
as if I'm some haggard spinster.

188
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:18,680
I'm sorry ma'am...

189
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,080
I mean, miss.

190
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm Abraham, Lincoln.

191
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,600
Mary Todd.

192
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,085
Darling, there you are.

193
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,765
You mustn't clip from
store to store so quickly.

194
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,000
Perhaps if you didn't stop for jaw
with every gentleman in Springfield...

195
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:44,285
I could say the same for you.

196
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,200
Steven Douglas, how do you do.
- Abraham Lincoln.

197
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,165
Are you a voting man Mr. Lincoln?

198
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,800
How do you feel about keeping slavery out
of Illinois I'm running for the legislature.

199
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,817
I'm sure he'd love to
hear your campaign speech,

200
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:04,626
but Mr. Lincoln was just
about to attend to my list.

201
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,400
We were talking dear, slavery,
it's a complicated issue.

202
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:11,120
I couldn't disagree with
you more Mr. Douglas.

203
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Mr. Douglas, miss Todd, you met my new
associate Abraham, a letter came for you.

204
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,120
<i>Dear Abe, your prescription
awaits you at the local pharmacy.</i>

205
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,800
<i>Ask for Aaron Stibble, jr.</i>

206
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:40,717
Mr. Lincoln?

207
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm so sorry.

208
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,480
Good day work, Abraham.
- Thank you.

209
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,885
<i>But don't forget.</i>

210
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,800
<i>Always have a contingency plan.</i>

211
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,080
Aaron Stibble junior?
- Yes?

212
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,200
Don't worry, it'll only
hurt for a second or two.

213
00:24:59,235 --> 00:25:02,600
Did you eat today?

214
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,880
<i>I had killed a monster,
and I would kill again.</i>

215
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,520
<i>But no amount of death
could make me forget.</i>

216
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,080
Merciful Christ Lincoln,
what happened to your face?

217
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,400
I'm alright, I'll still be able to work.
- Work? To hell with work.

218
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:03,485
We got invited to a ball.

219
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,280
Could be your chance to save
Mary Todd from a life of boredom.

220
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,460
This suit makes me look ridiculous.
- Nonsense,

221
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:13,600
but that hat makes you
look ridiculous, come on.

222
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,080
There she is. Mr. Douglas,
Joshua Speed, nice to see you.

223
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,765
Marry you look lovely as usual.

224
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,140
He is still missing.
- Who is that?

225
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:28,480
Aaron Stibble.
- Junior or senior?

226
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,485
Junior.

227
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,800
Who is that man?
- I don't know.

228
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,365
Mr. Douglas, you know
senator Nolan of course?

229
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,880
Ah yes, Steven good to see you.
- Have you heard the news?

230
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,720
We're looking into it. Rest
assured, this kind of lawlessness

231
00:26:50,755 --> 00:26:54,480
won't stand in the noble state of Illinois.

232
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,085
It's called a dance.

233
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,320
If we were meant to sit alone they
would have called it something else.

234
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:14,480
Yes, I suppose they would have.

235
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,920
Come Mr. Lincoln, you'll ruin
upholstery if you sit there any longer.

236
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,800
I'm sure you're a very nice
man Mr. Lincoln, but you're a...

237
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:30,880
A shop keeper in a borrowed suit.

238
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,920
No, it's not a matter of means, really, no.

239
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,080
Actually I'm looking for someone different,

240
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,920
someone whose life is a bit
more, adventurous, and well...

241
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:45,365
My apologies, I'm never this...
- Honest? - Rude.

242
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,885
Miss Todd, may I speak candid?
I too came here to better myself,

243
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,860
That's why I've taken an interest in
the law and why, if I may be so bold,

244
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:59,800
I've taken an interest in you.
And as for the adventure that you seek,

245
00:27:59,835 --> 00:28:03,520
I suspect that few men could
ever hope to provide that for you.

246
00:28:03,555 --> 00:28:07,277
Least of all your fiancee, Steven Douglas.

247
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:11,000
Mr. Lincoln, you are full of surprises.

248
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,200
Miss Todd, you have no idea.

249
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,920
<i>Dear Abraham, I've made a
deposit at the local bank.</i>

250
00:28:21,955 --> 00:28:26,320
<i>Be careful, it can quickly disappear.</i>

251
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,165
<i>Henry, there are more than
I ever thought possible.</i>

252
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,000
<i>Pharmacists, inn keepers, pastors...
That's more than a man can bear.</i>

253
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,200
Well, I see I'm such interesting company.
- I'm sorry.

254
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,260
I've been working nights.

255
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:47,765
Really? Is that true?

256
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,600
Do you really want to know the truth, Mary?

257
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,400
Each and every night, I go out.

258
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,200
Hunting vampires.

259
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,885
Well, how do you hunt these vampires?

260
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:22,000
With an axe, special silver axe, of course.

261
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:24,480
Of course.

262
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,680
And how many would you
reckon you've killed?

263
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,565
Five, no, six.

264
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,680
I've killed six vampires.

265
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,000
My goodness.

266
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,965
Abe.

267
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,200
You, here I thought you
were a honest man, really.

268
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,280
I had a wonderful day, Abe.
- As did I, Mary.

269
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,000
Miss Todd, you are a woman
of ravishing resourcefulness.

270
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:31,600
Mr. Lincoln, you have no idea.

271
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,880
<i>You have no friends, no family.</i>

272
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,000
I should be going, it's late.

273
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,800
<i>How could I bring her into this world?
A world of demons, of danger?</i>

274
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:58,800
Good night then, Lincoln.
- Good night, Mary.

275
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:02,080
Happy hunting.

276
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,200
<i>If I truly cared for her,
the kindest thing I could do,</i>

277
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:12,200
<i>was walk away.</i>

278
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,080
This, hunter, is another
of Henry's disciples?

279
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,880
They say he's a madman.

280
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,080
I can't wait to meet him.

281
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Stock boy reading a law book.
What, studying to be a lawyer?

282
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:25,965
As a matter of fact, I am.

283
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,520
Alright, what about a little test? What's
the law for free slaves in the north?

284
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:34,925
According to the Fugitive
Slave Act of 1793,

285
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,400
enforcing article 4, section 2
of the United States Constitution,

286
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:41,765
all runaway slaves must be
returned to their owners.

287
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,800
However, Personal Liberty law
states that anyone who was born free

288
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:49,800
can not be taken under this act.
- I heard a good woman once say,

289
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:54,000
"Until all men are free, we're all slaves".

290
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,480
Will? Will Johnson?!

291
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,365
How did you...
- I was back home.

292
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,885
Heard you moved here,
studying to be a lawyer.

293
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,400
That's good, I'm in need of a good lawyer.
- Are you in some kind of trouble?

294
00:34:11,435 --> 00:34:14,320
I was freeing slaves down
south on the rail road,

295
00:34:14,355 --> 00:34:16,285
hoping to find my brother down there.

296
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,480
Some bounty hunters got after
me, said I was a runaway.

297
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,520
I need a writ Abe, saying I was born free.

298
00:34:25,555 --> 00:34:28,400
You know Will, come on.

299
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,320
Speed, this is Will Johnson,
my oldest friend in the world.

300
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,965
Store isn't gonna run itself Abe.

301
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,280
I'll have him back as soon as
possible, Mr. Speed, I promise.

302
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,800
You're getting tall Abe, look
you still don't eat much either.

303
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:52,400
Still afraid of the dark too?
- Not so much anymore.

304
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,920
That's him Abe, that's the
guy that's been chasing me.

305
00:34:56,955 --> 00:35:01,085
Gentlemen, gentlemen I'm
sure we can work this out.

306
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,000
I suggest you walk away son.
- No sir, I suggest you do.

307
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,600
I've sent word to senator
Nolan, I'll have you out soon.

308
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:26,565
You're far too kind Miss Todd.

309
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,500
And he's far too ugly
to have a woman like you.

310
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,200
I think that common looking
people are the best in the world.

311
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:37,280
That's why the Lord makes so many of them.

312
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,480
I just thank God he was there.

313
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,800
I won't always be there, Mary.

314
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,320
What if something was going
on, something terrible...

315
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,000
And you knew that there was no way
on Earth that one man could stop it?

316
00:35:57,035 --> 00:36:00,480
What would you do?

317
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,200
I wouldn't back away from what's
right, just because it's hard.

318
00:36:07,235 --> 00:36:12,720
My father used to say: "Plant
your feet, and stand firm."

319
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:17,880
The only question is
where to put your feet.

320
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,880
We may fail in this fight, we may only
shatter trankful veil of oppression,

321
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,485
but we must not be detoured!

322
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,485
For ours is a just and noble
cause, the cause of freedom,

323
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,880
the very cause upon which our founding
fathers built this great nation.

324
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,120
Voice like that, it's too
strong to be stuck keeping shop.

325
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:51,485
I'm actually studying to be a lawyer.

326
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,120
Mr. Lincoln, maybe it's time
you thought about politics.

327
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,400
I can connect you with the right people.
- Thank you senator Nolan.

328
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,680
A pleasure, young man. - Same.
- You're on your way, Mr. Lincoln.

329
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,800
I sent you to Springfield to
hunt vampires, not to chase votes.

330
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:18,880
Lesson 1: Always have a contingency plan.

331
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,800
If vampire hunting doesn't pan out,
I'll need a career to fall back on.

332
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,480
I'm being serious.
- So am I, Henry.

333
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,685
I have done everything you've asked of me.

334
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,400
Every letter, every name, but
never the letter I wait for,

335
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:36,217
and never the name I want most.

336
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:40,000
When do I get to kill Jack Barts?

337
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,600
Barts knows about Mary, it's time.

338
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,480
Abraham.

339
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Be careful.

340
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,400
Abraham fucking Lincoln...

341
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:31,565
Miss again!

342
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,280
Hope you're better with an
axe than you were with a gun!

343
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,720
Come on Lincoln!

344
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,200
Catch me before I get to Mary!

345
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,480
Catch me if you can boy!

346
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,365
There's thousands of us here...

347
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,800
He won't stop until this
whole country is ours.

348
00:41:28,835 --> 00:41:35,200
They're coming for you
now, ask your friend, Henry.

349
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,285
Shut your mouth you stupid whore, give me

350
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,520
what I'm here for or
I'll knock your teeth out!

351
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,480
You lying son of a bitch.

352
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,880
Goddammit!

353
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,880
No Abe! Stop!

354
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,540
You weren't ready to know.
- What, that you are a vampire?!

355
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:48,600
You are not the only one who
has lost everything to vampires.

356
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,800
Just because the carriage stops,

357
00:42:57,835 --> 00:43:01,520
doesn't mean we have to.

358
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,000
Get in the carriage.

359
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,120
Take this. Run, just run.

360
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,240
Her soul is pure.

361
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:12,000
But yours, Henry...

362
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,200
It's one of God's little tricks.

363
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:34,217
Vampires cannot kill their own kind.

364
00:45:34,252 --> 00:45:38,200
Only the living can kill the dead.

365
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,320
Welcome to the family.

366
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:01,000
You can't save the world and the ones you
love, Lincoln. You need to make a choice.

367
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,520
I'm sorry. But goodbye.

368
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,880
Abe?!
- Mary?!

369
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,260
What on earth are you doing?
- Come on in.

370
00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:55,565
What are you hiding?
- Nothing. - Abe?

371
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,000
It's nothing.
- Abe I know when you're lying.

372
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:02,565
What are you hiding from me?
- Alright.

373
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,800
I didn't want to tell you this way,
this is not the way that I planned it.

374
00:47:06,835 --> 00:47:10,800
But if you really must know...

375
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,485
Mary Todd...

376
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,400
Will you make me the happiest of men?

377
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:01,440
And do you, Abraham, promise to love
her, comfort her, be honorable and honest

378
00:48:01,475 --> 00:48:07,520
with her in all things, in sickness
and health, 'till death do you part?

379
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,965
I do.

380
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,400
Then by the power vested in me by almighty
God, and the great state of Illinois,

381
00:48:14,435 --> 00:48:18,480
I now pronounce you man and wife.

382
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,200
You may kiss the bride.

383
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,480
Your mother would be so proud.
- Thank you, Will.

384
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,480
I'm happy you could be here,
you're the only family I have.

385
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,480
Except for this one.
- Congratulations.

386
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,320
May I introduce, Mr.
Henry Sturges, my wife

387
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:48,080
Mary, and my dear friend Will Johnson.

388
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,965
Heavens Mr. Sturges, you're
as chilly as the winter wind.

389
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,200
Henry please. I'm afraid that's the
hazard of carrying one's own bottle.

390
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:59,365
You know what they say, cold hands
warm heart. - I highly doubt that.

391
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,000
Mr. Sturges is a business associate. - And
I thought we could talk a little business.

392
00:49:03,035 --> 00:49:06,720
Of course, excuse me.

393
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,880
What the hell are you doing here?
- Be cautious Abraham,

394
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,520
one forgets how easily we can
lose the most precious things.

395
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,000
They don't even know, who I am.

396
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,725
Go up river, and invite this,

397
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,600
Mr. Lincoln, to join
us at the plantation.

398
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,880
We're gonna throw a ball in his honor.

399
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,000
What makes you think he'll accept?

400
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,080
I think we can find a way to tempt him.

401
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,120
Abe, we got a problem.

402
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,720
They took Will.

403
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,480
What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna accept his invitation.

404
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,860
<i>Speed deserved to know to truth
what we were about to face.</i>

405
00:51:06,895 --> 00:51:10,447
<i>I told him everything, not
knowing if he would believe me</i>

406
00:51:10,482 --> 00:51:14,000
<i>or think me mad, not knowing
if he would have the courage</i>

407
00:51:14,035 --> 00:51:17,280
<i>to face the monsters that
I had come to know.</i>

408
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,280
You and me Abraham, together
we can accomplish anything.

409
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,200
NEW ORLEANS

410
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,800
There are no slaves, where are they?

411
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:50,400
I was just wondering that.

412
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,485
Something isn't right about this, Abe.
- Yeah.

413
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,720
I don't know how to dance.
- Don't worry, I'll teach you.

414
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,920
Wait here.

415
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,400
Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served.

416
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,940
Bravo, Mr. Lincoln. Bravo.

417
00:54:39,975 --> 00:54:44,480
Even better than I'd heard.

418
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,000
Shame to sacrifice so many of my best men,
I needed to know if you were up to the task.

419
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,877
What do you want with me?
- To see you liberated.

420
00:54:52,912 --> 00:54:56,685
To see you rise up and
destroy your oppressor.

421
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,085
That's interesting advice,
coming from a slave owner.

422
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:04,000
Man have enslaved each other since they
invented gods to forgive them for doing it.

423
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:09,800
I have seen Jews build Egypt's glory.

424
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,880
Seen Christians thrown
to lions with my own eyes.

425
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,740
And I have seen Africans sell
their own kind to Europeans.

426
00:55:24,775 --> 00:55:30,080
May I share, one of the
revelations of my 5.000 years?

427
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,680
We are all slaves to something.

428
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,600
I to eternity, you to your convictions,
others to the colour of their skin.

429
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:45,520
All I ever wanted was to see my
kind granted their rightful place.

430
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:50,200
But there are those of us,
those like your friend Henry,

431
00:55:50,235 --> 00:55:53,165
who enjoy living in the dark.

432
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,480
As you're doubtless aware, I cannot
personally destroy him, nor he I.

433
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,680
You, Mr. Lincoln,

434
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,120
you could eliminate those
last pockets of resistance

435
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:10,480
beginning with Henry Sturges himself.

436
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:14,080
All I ask...

437
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,200
Is for you to break your chains.

438
00:56:18,235 --> 00:56:21,800
Kill your master, be free.

439
00:56:21,835 --> 00:56:24,765
And if I refuse?

440
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,800
Then you can go on your merry way.

441
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,040
After I make you one of us.

442
00:56:32,075 --> 00:56:36,000
And spoon feed you your friend.

443
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,760
Simple yes or no will suffice.

444
00:56:41,795 --> 00:56:46,285
Kill Henry, save your friend.

445
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,600
Feel free to take your time to decide, 5...

446
00:56:49,635 --> 00:56:53,680
4, 3,

447
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,120
2, 1.

448
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,520
Come on!

449
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,680
This way!

450
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,280
Miss Tubman, we've been waiting for you.

451
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,800
Come quickly.

452
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,000
People getting killed every
day, slaves disappearing,

453
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:28,800
some people talk abut monsters and demons.

454
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,520
Good morning, how can I assist
you on this beautiful day?

455
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,565
We're looking for three men.

456
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,320
You know, I did see
someone ride down that way.

457
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,680
You're welcome to come in if you'd
like, my service is about to begin.

458
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,840
I take it y'all came from up north?
- Yes ma'am.

459
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:10,480
I suggest you get back
there as fast as you can.

460
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:15,520
There's a war coming, a war
for the soul of the country.

461
00:59:15,555 --> 00:59:19,800
Gonna be all colors of blood spilled.

462
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,400
Their labor, their blood! More blood
than you could possibly imagine!

463
00:59:29,435 --> 00:59:32,285
I have seen this horror
of the south, first hand.

464
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,200
I say the need for peace
outweighs the needs of the blacks,

465
00:59:36,235 --> 00:59:40,080
I say that if the people of
this great nation want slavery,

466
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,400
then let them have it. - The demon of
slavery is tearing our country apart.

467
00:59:44,435 --> 00:59:48,480
We must stand up, we must
stand strong and fight,

468
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,765
fight for the very soul of our nation

469
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:57,520
Until every man is free, we are all slaves!

470
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,765
You cannot take on slavery, Abraham!

471
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,480
You cannot take on the whole south!
- Why? Because of Adam?

472
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,685
No.
- Are you afraid of him?

473
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,000
Because it is the only thing that has
kept them satiated for all these years.

474
01:00:13,035 --> 01:00:15,757
And you take that away,
then no one is safe.

475
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:18,480
So you get to choose
who lives and who dies.

476
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,085
A great man once said,
what we do, we do not for

477
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,680
ourselves, not for one man,
but for the good of all mankind!

478
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:28,600
Not all mankind, Abraham!
- Abe?

479
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,500
May I have my husband back?

480
01:00:33,535 --> 01:00:36,400
He is all yours, Mrs. Lincoln.

481
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,765
<i>Henry only saw the struggle his way.</i>

482
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,365
<i>But I began at last to see it another.</i>

483
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:50,080
<i>To see and to feel the
even grater issues at stake.</i>

484
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,365
<i>So he and I would go our separate ways.</i>

485
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:59,520
<i>As the Bible says, the time had come
for me to put aside childish things.</i>

486
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:04,600
<i>I would fight not with an
axe, but with words and ideals.</i>

487
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,800
<i>For a time, they proved a stronger weapon.</i>

488
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,165
In compliance with a custom as
old as the Government itself...

489
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:34,080
I appear before you to to take in
your presence the oath prescribed...

490
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,365
by the Constitution of the United States,

491
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:43,000
to be taken by the President "before he
enters on the execution of this office."

492
01:01:43,035 --> 01:01:47,680
The question of slavery is better
settled with a pen than with a sword!

493
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,280
<i>Through twists of fate, I
found myself at 50 years of age,</i>

494
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:13,965
<i>a father of a nation, that
was tearing itself apart.</i>

495
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,320
<i>While trying to be the father to a boy, not
much older than I was when I lost my mother.</i>

496
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:25,280
Three thousand more, dead.

497
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,400
When was the last time you had something
to eat? - Not hungry, thank you.

498
01:02:40,435 --> 01:02:45,000
You got to eat Abe, you're only human.

499
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,720
Come along, Willie.

500
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,600
Willie?

501
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,200
Brother?

502
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:22,200
If you do this, there
is no turning back, Abe.

503
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,200
I know.

504
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,700
I'm trying to protect
the freedom of a nation.

505
01:03:29,735 --> 01:03:33,800
If this war is truly a stand against evil,

506
01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:37,885
then let it stand for something.

507
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,600
If it is a war for the freedom of men,
why not give all men a reason to fight it?!

508
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,165
All persons held as slaves, within any
State or designated part of a State,

509
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,200
the people whereof shall be in rebellion
against the United States shall be then...

510
01:03:54,235 --> 01:03:58,720
Thenceforward shall be, free.

511
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,680
Morning.

512
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,485
Precious little one.

513
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,080
What's your name?
- Willie.

514
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:28,880
And your father, what's his?
- Abraham.

515
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,800
How is our little soldier faring?

516
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:19,120
I've never seen anything
like it. I'm sorry.

517
01:05:19,155 --> 01:05:22,480
I don't know what else to do.

518
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,365
Abe...

519
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,280
Mary's calling for you.

520
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:23,200
I'm so sorry Abraham.

521
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,280
Why didn't they take me?
- Because they know.

522
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,800
It is a fate much worse than death.

523
01:07:34,835 --> 01:07:38,165
Mary...

524
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,320
Is inconsolable.

525
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,165
She says she doesn't
want to go on without him.

526
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,000
There is a way Abraham, you
know that I can restore the dead.

527
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,480
Do it.

528
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,520
Do it.
- Mary?

529
01:08:01,555 --> 01:08:04,965
Do it.

530
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
That journal, the one you always
kept in your coat pocket...

531
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,000
I know I shouldn't have Abe, but I
needed to know what you were hiding.

532
01:08:15,035 --> 01:08:20,000
If what you say is true, I beg you...

533
01:08:20,035 --> 01:08:22,765
Give us our little boy back.

534
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,965
Mary, he wouldn't be our little boy.

535
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,565
He would be something
else, something terrible.

536
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,080
Trust me, you don't want that.
- You're asking me to trust you,

537
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,480
after you lied to me for all these years?!

538
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,880
I did it to protect you,
to protect our family.

539
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:42,765
And how did that work out?!
You did this Abe!

540
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:48,720
You did this! You brought this on
him! You brought this on our boy!

541
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,485
Let me go to them, make a truce with Adam.

542
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,280
We must stop this war, Willie's
death is just the beginning.

543
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,280
Don't you dare say his name.
- I warned you.

544
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:11,280
You didn't heed me. How many more boys
will have to die before you listen to me?

545
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,400
These boys are dying in vein.
We should pull the troops back.

546
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:30,400
Abraham, this war has cost us countless
lives, not to mention millions of dollars.

547
01:09:30,435 --> 01:09:35,200
I thought we were gonna make this
country great, not tear it apart.

548
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:39,400
This is the only way we can
save the country now, Speed.

549
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,080
Send in troops.

550
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,200
Union troops are flooding onto the field.

551
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:00,600
We are now outnumbered, and
ill-equipped compared to the North.

552
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,600
We'll support you, but you
will need to support us.

553
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,565
No, thank you.

554
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,280
Rest assured, Mr. Davis.

555
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,920
You'll have as many of my kind as you need.

556
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,600
Fire!

557
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,360
Ready!

558
01:10:57,395 --> 01:10:59,920
Aim!

559
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,600
Here they come!

560
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,280
Fire!

561
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,200
Why did they drop their rifles?!

562
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,200
Fire!

563
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,280
The first day of Gettysburg.

564
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,000
It's been a disaster. I don't
think the army can survive another.

565
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,400
If the rebels break through
they'll be here, in days.

566
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:25,360
Generals think we should
evacuate Washington,

567
01:12:25,395 --> 01:12:30,000
run north for New York
or Boston if need be.

568
01:12:30,035 --> 01:12:34,000
You have to win this war.

569
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:38,565
If you don't then all of it...

570
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,400
Then our son's death will have been for
nothing. - How can I win a war,

571
01:12:42,435 --> 01:12:45,085
when I can't even protect my own family?

572
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,080
Our men have no way of defending
themselves against this enemy.

573
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:53,280
When our bullets are useless, our
bayonets are as powerless as this fork!

574
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,400
This...

575
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,280
Will! Speed!

576
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:08,200
This, this is what me need.

577
01:13:08,235 --> 01:13:11,685
A fork.
- Silver.

578
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,720
OK, how much do we need?

579
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,880
All of it.

580
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,200
And why are telling me this, Mr.
Speed? Why betray your friend?

581
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:46,880
He is my friend, but I
love this country even more.

582
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:52,000
And he, more than anyone, is responsible
for tearing this nation apart.

583
01:13:52,035 --> 01:13:56,000
You've done the right thing.

584
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,280
I know.

585
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:04,565
32, 33, 34, 35...

586
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,000
That is a lot of silver Abe.

587
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,800
But how are we gonna get all this there?

588
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,200
I'm sorry, Mary.

589
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,600
I'm sorry I've kept you in
the dark all these years.

590
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:53,200
I need you Mary.

591
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,400
I've waited a long time to
hear you say those words.

592
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,720
I want you to leave Washington, Mary.

593
01:15:21,755 --> 01:15:24,880
Evelyn, please have some tea.

594
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,120
I very much appreciate you
coming to speak with me today.

595
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,240
Things have not been easy with my...

596
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:36,365
The death of my son and the war...

597
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:41,120
I need to get out of Washington,
and I need a lot of help.

598
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:44,720
This war, ends tonight.

599
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:53,280
And with it, our millennium of darkness.

600
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:57,400
We have to do this on our own, no
one can know what's on that train.

601
01:16:57,435 --> 01:17:00,400
If we don't get those weapons
to those boys as Gettysburg,

602
01:17:00,435 --> 01:17:04,000
war is over.

603
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,400
It's time we had a nation of our own.

604
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,685
Come.

605
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,565
We have a train to catch.

606
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,280
It's 80 miles from here to Gettysburg.

607
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:24,480
80 miles will decide whether this
nation belongs to the living,

608
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,520
or the dead.

609
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,600
Is everything alright Speed?

610
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,800
I just can't believe you're
still writing in that book.

611
01:18:02,835 --> 01:18:07,000
It's all in here Speed, good with the bad.

612
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,600
What's this?
- They're fleeing the nest,

613
01:18:31,635 --> 01:18:35,720
leaving Washington free for us.

614
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,800
Look at me.

615
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,880
I said, look at me.
- Leave her, don't want to miss this train.

616
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,005
Henry, what the hell are you doing here?

617
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,465
I just wanted to see how far
your foolishness would take you.

618
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,280
I don't have time to argue.
- I didn't come here to argue with you.

619
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:40,080
I came here to tell you that
your dear friend Speed back there,

620
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:43,085
is a traitor.

621
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,885
He betrayed you Abe, Speed is leading..

622
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,720
You have no idea what you're talking about.

623
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,520
Well, that's all according to plan.

624
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,685
They're here Abe. A whole heap of them.

625
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,920
We can't let them stop this train.
- You go through there and you're dead!

626
01:20:31,955 --> 01:20:35,920
Get out now, it's your last chance.

627
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,800
You loaded that thing?

628
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:45,520
We gotta come away from the locomotive.

629
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,900
Why don't you let him go, Lincoln?
Emancipate yourselves.

630
01:23:47,935 --> 01:23:52,280
I'll never follow you.
- You don't have to follow me Abe.

631
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,300
I have the train, I have your silver.

632
01:23:55,335 --> 01:23:58,280
Soon I'll have the whole country.

633
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,480
I'm gonna destroy a
myth of Abraham Lincoln,

634
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:07,520
so that history will forever know
you not as a man, but as a monster!

635
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,720
Lincoln set us up.
We've been tricked, Adam.

636
01:25:16,755 --> 01:25:20,600
There is no silver on this train.

637
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,480
Abe!

638
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,480
Abe!

639
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Abe!

640
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:10,480
Hello, Speed. Where's the silver?

641
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:14,020
Silver? It should be here.

642
01:26:14,055 --> 01:26:17,485
Why did you lie to me?!

643
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,400
Get you all on one place, to finish you.
- Speed?!

644
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,600
No!

645
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,565
Mr. President!

646
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,200
You have nowhere left to run, Lincoln!

647
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,000
Where is it?! Where's the silver?!

648
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:45,120
Right here!

649
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,565
Thank you Henry.

650
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:33,600
I suppose some vampires can be trusted.

651
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:38,080
As can some men, Abraham.

652
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:43,520
If the train was a decoy,
where is the silver?

653
01:29:43,555 --> 01:29:47,597
This isn't the only rail road.

654
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:51,605
A wise man once taught me,

655
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:55,520
always have a contingency plan.

656
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,200
Bayonets, bayonets for Springfield muskets.

657
01:30:02,235 --> 01:30:05,520
Springfield muskets!

658
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,200
Fire!

659
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,365
Four score and seven years ago,

660
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:26,080
our fathers brought forth on
this continent a new nation,

661
01:31:26,115 --> 01:31:30,760
conceived in liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition

662
01:31:30,795 --> 01:31:35,280
that all men are created equal.

663
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:39,560
Now we are engaged in a great civil war,

664
01:31:39,595 --> 01:31:44,197
testing whether that nation, or any nation,

665
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:48,800
so conceived and so
dedicated, can long endure.

666
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:00,320
It is for us the living, rather, to be
dedicated here to the unfinished work

667
01:32:00,355 --> 01:32:05,885
which they who fought here
have thus far so nobly advanced.

668
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:12,200
It is rather for us to be here dedicated
to the great task remaining before us

669
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:16,480
that from these honored dead we
take increased devotion to that cause

670
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:21,165
for which they gave the last
full measure of devotion,

671
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:27,200
that we here highly resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain,

672
01:32:27,235 --> 01:32:33,417
that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom,

673
01:32:33,452 --> 01:32:39,600
and that government of the people,
by the people, for the people,

674
01:32:39,635 --> 01:32:44,400
shall not perish from the earth.

675
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,480
<i>Our enemies have made their exodus.</i>

676
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:05,365
<i>Some back to Europe, some to
South America and the Orient.</i>

677
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:10,720
<i>They've seen that America shall
forever be a nation of living men,</i>

678
01:33:10,755 --> 01:33:14,800
<i>a nation of free men.</i>

679
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,280
We make rather a good team, you and I.

680
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:21,400
One can't help but think of all the
good we could do if we had more time.

681
01:33:21,435 --> 01:33:28,400
Limitless time.
- Yes well, time waits for no man.

682
01:33:28,435 --> 01:33:31,520
We're gonna be late for the theatre.

683
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:37,920
Hold on to this for me, Henry.

684
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,480
Mary, darling, have you seen my hat?

685
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:51,280
On your desk, in the office.

686
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:56,000
Have you seen my hat?
- Abraham, let me make you immortal.

687
01:33:56,035 --> 01:33:58,285
Let us fight through
the ages, side by side.

688
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:02,320
Vampires are not the only
things that live forever.

689
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:22,965
<i>History prefers legends to men.</i>

690
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,480
<i>It prefers nobility, to brutality.</i>

691
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:30,080
<i>Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.</i>

692
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:34,660
<i>History remembers the
battle, and forgets the blood.</i>

693
01:34:34,695 --> 01:34:39,200
<i>However history remembers of
me, if it does at all...</i>

694
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:46,000
<i>It shall only remember,
a fraction of the truth.</i>

695
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,520
One more.

696
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:16,480
A guy only gets that drunk when he
wants to kiss a girl or kill a man.

697
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
So which is it?

698
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,000
