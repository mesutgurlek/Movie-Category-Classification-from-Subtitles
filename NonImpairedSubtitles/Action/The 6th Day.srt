G.P.S. ?  EMERGENCY BEACONS ?
YEAH.

141
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,787
ALL RIGHT,
ANY QUESTIONS ?

142
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,290
YEAH, I GOT A QUESTION.
EXCUSE ME.
HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE REPETS ?

143
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,292
YEAH, I GOT A DOG.
I GOT A SNAKE.

144
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,295
- I GOT YOUR POINT.
- DOGS, SNAKES OR AT LEAST
KNOWS SOMEBODY WHO HAS ONE ?

145
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,298
- I KNOW SOMEBODY, YEAH.

PROUD OF YOURSELF ?
- VERY.

148
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,309
SEE YOU GUYS.

149
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,320
I KNOW YOU'RE OLD SCHOOL,
BUT ALL THE KIDS TODAY,
THEY GREW UP WITH REPETS.

150
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,824
- THESE DAYS
IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL.
- NOT TO ME.

151
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:26,829
NOT TO YOU.  YOU WANT YOUR KID
CRYING BECAUSE HER DOG DIED ?
DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

152
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,832
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S EVEN A LITTLE BIT CREEPY ?
NO.

153
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,834
I DON'T.

154
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,337
LET'S TEST THE REMOTE.
SEE IF YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH ME.

155
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,340
ALL RIGHTY, HERE WE GO.

156
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,850
THESE REPETS,
THEY COME BACK TO YOU,
YOU CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

157
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,352
- TRUST ME, I HAD IT DONE.
- BULLSHIT.

[ Hank ]
I'M SERIOUS !
SADIE, MY CAT.

00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,360
- SHE'S A REPET.
- YOU HAD YOUR CAT CLONED ?

160
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,363
- YEAH, SHE FELL OUT
OF MY CONDO WINDOW.
-OUCH.

YOU DID WELL.
THANK YOU.

HOW LONG ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO KEEP ME AT KELLY'S ?
TILL 7:00.  WHY ?

166
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,408
MAYBE WE SHOULD
CHECK OUT REPET.

167
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,929
GOOD MORNING.
YOU GENTLEMEN THE OWNERS ?

168
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,931
YEP, THAT'S US.
EXCELLENT.

00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,934
LARRY STERN.
I'M WITH MR. DRUCKER'S
ADVANCE TEAM.

I'VE GOT A CONTRACT HERE.
I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT
PRETTY STANDARD EXCEPT FOR--

WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL.

173

- HERE FOR THE BLOOD TEST ?
- NO.  MY TECHNICIAN
IS SET UP IN YOUR OFFICE.

YOU SAID THESE FORMS
ARE STANDARD EXCEPT WHAT ?

176
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,458
IT'S OUR NORMAL
CHARTER CONTRACT.
IT HAS A NONDISCLOSURE CLAUSE.

177
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,460
DURING THE FLIGHT,
YOU MAY OVERHEAR
MR. DRUCKER'S PHONE CALLS.

IT COULD BE ANYTHING
FROM BIG MERGERS TO INSIDE

REGARDLESS, WE HAVE
A LEGAL OBLIGATION
TO PROTECT THAT STUFF.

WHAT DOES THIS GUY THINK ?
HE'S THE PRESIDENT ?

181
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,474
NO, HE CONSIDERS HER
TO BE THE WORLD'S SECOND
MOST IMPORTANT PERSON.

OOH, THAT'S BIG STUFF.

ALL FOR A DAY
OF SNOWBOARDING ?

184
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,985
THE BLOOD TEST WAS AGONY.
SERIOUSLY, I WAS SCREAMING.

185
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,988
SHE'S JUST KIDDING.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

IT REALLY DOESN'T HURT.
JUST PRESS YOUR THUMB HERE.

- RIGHT HERE ?
-YES, JUST LIKE THAT.

- ALL DONE.
- DIDN'T FEEL A THING.

189

NEED TO CHECK YOUR VISION.
PLACE YOUR CHIN HERE.
LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD.

- RIGHT HERE ?
- MM-HMM.

ANYONE WHO COMES IN CONTACT
WITH MR. DRUCKER.

00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,515
- ALL RIGHT, I PRESS HERE ?

00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,518
AND HERE.

196
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,025
PERFECT, BOTH OF YOU.

197
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,528
AFTER THIS, I'M GOING TO TOWN
TO TEST A CHEF AND TWO WAITERS.

198
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:53,035
THE PINK COPY
OF THE CONTRACT IS YOURS.
I'LL TAKE THE REST.

00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,037
HERE WE GO.
HAVE A NICE FLIGHT,

TA-TA.

201
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,543
YOU KNOW, I COULD
TAKE CARE OF DRUCKER.

202
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,046
THAT WAY, YOU COULD HAVE
TIME TO GET OLIVER CLONED.

203
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,548
I'M NOT GETTING THE DOG CLONED.
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK IT OUT.

204
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,551
I KNOW, BUT ONCE YOU SEE IT,
YOU'RE GONNA SAY YES.

205
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,553
I KNOW DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
YOU'RE A SOFTY.

206
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:16,558
UM, THEY SPECIFICALLY
ASKED FOR ADAM BY NAME.
I KNOW WHAT SPECIFICALLY MEANS.

207
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:21,063
I ALSO KNOW THAT THE BODYGUARDS
CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
THEY NEVER GOT OUR NAMES.

208
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,564
OH !
THAT'S TRUE.

209
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,067
I KNOW THAT
I SCREW AROUND A LOT.

210
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,570
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FLYING,
YOU KNOW I'M SERIOUS.
I COULD DO IT.

211
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,073
GO ENJOY YOUR BIRTHDAY.

212
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,077
IF YOU WANT TO BE ME,
TRY TO ACT
A LITTLE BIT MORE MANLY.

OKAY ?  CHEST OUT.

HI, I'M MICHAEL DRUCKER.
YOU MUST BE ADAM GIBSON.

218
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,099
THAT'S RIGHT.
ADAM'S THE NAME
AND FLYING'S THE GAME.

HE SAYS YOU KNOW
THE MOUNTAINS LIKE NOBODY ELSE.

TRUE FOR EVERYONE EXCEPT

I PAY YOUR LAW FIRM,
SO I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

STOP THE CLONING.
SAY NO TO REPET.

241
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,725
WE CAN CLONE YOUR
FOUR-LEGGED LOVED ONE
IN JUST A FEW SHORT HOURS.

242
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,729
HOW CAN WE DO IT ?
IT ALL BEGINS WITH
THE GROWING OF BLANKS,

243
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,232
ANIMAL DRONES
STRIPPED OF ALL
CHARACTERISTIC D.N.A.,

244
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,235
IN EMBRYONIC TANKS
AT THE REPET FACTORY.

245
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:17,739
IN STAGE TWO, YOUR PET'S D.N.A.
IS EXTRACTED FROM A LOCK OF FUR
OR DROP OF BLOOD...

246
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,743
AND THEN INFUSED
ON A CELLULAR LEVEL
INTO THE BLANK.

247
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,247
IN THE FINAL STAGE,
USING REPET'S PATENTED
CEREBRAL SYNCORDING PROCESS,

248
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,250
ALL OF YOUR PET'S THOUGHTS,
MEMORIES AND INSTINCTS...

249
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,752
ARE PAINLESSLY TRANSPLANTED
VIA THE OPTIC NERVE.

250
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:35,757
STILL CAN'T MAKE UP
YOUR MIND, HUH ?

251
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,260
YOU LOST A DOG, RIGHT ?

252
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,763
YES.  MY DAUGHTER'S.
OH, WHAT A HEARTBREAK.

253
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,766
WHAT'D YOU SAY
HIS NAME WAS AGAIN ?
OLIVER.

254
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:50,772
WELL, OLIVER'S IN LUCK.
WE'RE HAVING A SPECIAL
THIS WEEK, 20% OFF.

255
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,275
WHEN DID OLIVER DIE ?
SOMETIME THIS MORNING.

256
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,777
THAT'S PERFECT.
WE CAN STILL DO
A POSTMORTEM SYNCORDING.

257
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,281
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO ACT FAST.
'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY A 12-HOUR
WINDOW ON DECEASED BRAINS.

258
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,783
I HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT WHOLE IDEA.

259
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,786
I MEAN, SUPPOSE
THAT CLONES HAVE NO SOUL,
OR THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

260
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:10,292
CLONE PETS ARE EVERY BIT
AS SAFE AS REAL PETS.
PLUS... THEY'RE INSURED.

261
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:15,297
IF IT IS SO SAFE,
THEN WHY IS IT AGAINST THE LAW
TO CLONE HUMAN BEINGS ?

262
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,300
BECAUSE THE HUMAN BRAIN
IS MUCH TOO COMPLICATED
TO SYNCORD.

263
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,302
NOW, YOU REMEMBER THAT
EXPERIMENT THEY DID, RIGHT ?

264
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,306
YES.
THAT'S WHY THAT DIDN'T WORK.
NOW IT'S ILLEGAL TO EVEN TRY.

265
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,309
BUT WITH PETS,
IT'S A TOTALLY PROVEN
TECHNOLOGY.

266
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,313
YOUR REPET, OLIVER, WILL BE
EXACTLY THE SAME DOG.

267
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:35,817
HE'LL KNOW ALL THE
SAME TRICKS YOU TAUGHT HIM,
WHERE THE BONES ARE BURIED.

268
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:40,822
HE WON'T EVEN KNOW HE'S A CLONE.
AND, DID I MENTION ?
THEY'RE INSURED.

269
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,824
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE INSURANCE.

270
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,328
I CARE ABOUT IF I CAN TRUST
MY DAUGHTER WITH A LARGE ANIMAL
WITH SHARP TEETH.

271
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,832
WE CAN MAKE HIM SMALLER
IF YOU WANT, WITH SOFTER TEETH.
YOU CAN ?

272
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,337
WE CAN EVEN COLOR COORDINATE HIM
TO MATCH YOUR DECORATING SCHEME.

273
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,840
-[ P.A. System ]  SIM-PAL,
THE BEST FRIEND MONEY CAN BUY.
- LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT.

274
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:03,845
-TREAT YOUR KIDS
TO A SIM-PAL TODAY.
- I MIGHT BE BACK.

275
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,847
YOU'LL BE BACK.

276
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,350
YOUR DAUGHTER WILL THINK
YOU'RE THE BEST DAD.

277
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,853
MY KID SISTER HAS TWO OF
THESE, AND SHE LOVES THEM.
