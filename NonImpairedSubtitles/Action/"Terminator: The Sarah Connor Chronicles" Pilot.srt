1
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:25,457
<i>There are those who believe that a child
in her womb shares his mother's dreams.</i>

2
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:27,715
<i>Her love for him.</i>

3
00:00:27,974 --> 00:00:29,682
<i>Her hopes for his future.</i>

4
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:33,496
<i>Is it told to him in pictures
while he sleeps inside her?</i>

5
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:36,393
<i>Is that why he reaches for her
in that first moment</i>

6
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:37,806
<i>and cries for her touch?</i>

7
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:42,584
<i>But what if you'd known since he was
inside you what his life held for him?</i>

8
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:44,268
<i>That he would be hunted.</i>

9
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:46,838
<i>That his fate was tied
to the fate of millions.</i>

10
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:50,368
<i>That every moment of your life
will be spent keeping him alive.</i>

11
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:53,221
<i>Would he understand
why you were so hard?</i>

12
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:55,984
<i>Why you held on so tight?</i>

13
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,179
<i>Will he still reach for you
if the only dream</i>

14
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,461
<i>you've ever shared
with him was a nightmare?</i>

15
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:08,267
<i>Would he know my love
runs through him like blood?</i>

16
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:12,090
John, now.

17
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:14,180
Now!

18
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:21,794
The cops make you at the diner?

19
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:23,612
I don't know. Maybe.

20
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,563
Yes.

21
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:34,770
Definitely.

22
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:37,758
Sarah Connor! John Connor!

23
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,393
Drop what you're carrying.

24
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:41,214
Put your hands on your head

25
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,922
and kneel on the ground.

26
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:44,544
Now!

27
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:23,849
Do me a favor, will you?

28
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:25,152
Fix it.

29
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,810
Drop your weapon!

30
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:08,301
Go!

31
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,140
You run!

32
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,270
Run!

33
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:06,443
Do it!

34
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,440
Do it! Kill me!

35
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,316
Nothing matters anymore.

36
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:12,873
Kill me!

37
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:14,718
You're right.

38
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:17,740
Nothing matters anymore.

39
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,253
Only the boy.

40
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:21,208
The future is ours.

41
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:22,658
And it begins

42
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,244
now.

43
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:04,736
You yelled, or something?

44
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:06,174
No.

45
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:12,424
Let me see it.

46
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:15,301
Did you forget?

47
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:22,144
No, I didn't forget.
I just am not used to it yet.

48
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:24,938
You sure we don't need
to have it sized?

49
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:28,107
No. It's perfect.

50
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,513
Just make sure it fits.

51
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:07,864
The Projet-SG Team
v. 1.1

52
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:09,314
<i>Special thanks to Herb.</i>

53
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,271
Mom, how many times have I told you?
It's freaky when you do that.

54
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:26,437
I'm sorry.

55
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:29,739
What time is it?

56
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:31,066
It's almost nine.

57
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:33,672
You're gonna be late for work.

58
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:38,516
What's going on?

59
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,331
We can't stay here, John.

60
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:47,839
What?

61
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:49,634
It's not safe.

62
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:52,610
Not safe from who?

63
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:54,940
Who mom? No one knows us.

64
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,755
No one asks questions.
It's been almost two years.

65
00:06:57,977 --> 00:06:59,735
School starts in like three weeks.

66
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,790
- We need to go.
- No, we don't need to go.

67
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,925
You need to go.

68
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,423
You're scared.
He gave you a ring, you're freakin out.

69
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:07,967
- I know you like him.
- So do you, mom!

70
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,709
So do you. You love him.
I know you do.

71
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,887
Listen to me,
the cops will never find us.

72
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,029
We're safe!

73
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:17,796
Don't you think that, John!

74
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:20,513
Don't you ever think that!
Look at me!

75
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:23,021
No one is ever safe.

76
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,347
Half an hour.

77
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:35,499
One bag.

78
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:37,430
Plus the guns.

79
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,483
I'll make pancakes.

80
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:54,299
<i>Every family has rules.</i>

81
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,069
<i>And we had ours.</i>

82
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:57,938
<i>Keep your head down.</i>

83
00:07:58,282 --> 00:07:59,438
<i>Keep your eyes up.</i>

84
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:02,634
<i>Resist the urge
to be seen as important or special.</i>

85
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:07,144
<i>Know your exits.</i>

86
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:12,210
I mean, she's not actually missing,
right?

87
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,350
- The way you explain it, she...
- Right.

88
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,017
The way I expain it,
she's not missing, she left.

89
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,944
- It happens more often than you think.
- You don't know her.

90
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:22,760
I can say the same about you,
Mr. Daniels.

91
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,273
F.B.I.?

92
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,334
You've been together long?

93
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,359
Six months, maybe.
A bit of a whirlwind.

94
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:38,881
You have no idea of the whirlwind.

95
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:40,164
Tell me.

96
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:44,167
Does the Skynet Defense System
mean anything to you?

97
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:48,771
How about this guy?

98
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:51,082
Miles Dyson.
I've never seen him before.

99
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:52,779
That's because he's dead.

100
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,159
Your fiancée,

101
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,130
firstly escaped from
the Pescadero Mental Hospital.

102
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,905
Blew him apart, two years ago.

103
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:02,801
Leveled a 4 storied research lab
along with him.

104
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:06,267
But since there's no lethal injection
for the destruction of property,

105
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:10,011
we'd stick with the murder of one of our
country's brightest computer scientists.

106
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,224
and...

107
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:14,748
a dedicated family man.

108
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:16,965
That's...

109
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:18,686
That's just not...

110
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,204
- Why would she do that?
- Well, Mr. Daniels,

111
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,876
it's the robots!

112
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:28,261
The ones from the future.

113
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,884
The ones Skynet sent to kill her son.

114
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:35,277
- Robots...
- Which makes total sense.

115
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:37,730
Because in the future,
John is not just her son...

116
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,335
He's the... I'm sorry, excuse me.

117
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:42,923
The leader of the resistance,

118
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:45,381
fighting artificially intelligent
machines,

119
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,533
determined to annihilate

120
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,101
the human race.

121
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,231
Skynet...

122
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:52,038
Did he strike you that way?

123
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:55,042
John!

124
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:57,570
A leader of a scrappy band of rebels?

125
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,960
- Luke Skywalker type.
- Don't be ridiculous.

126
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:05,120
I came here for help.
You can't really be asking me this.

127
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:06,656
No, I'm not.

128
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:10,804
This is just my pattern, Mr. Daniels.

129
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,168
This is just me,
impressing upon you

130
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:15,973
that I'm not here
because you lost your fiancée,

131
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,191
the love of your life,
and all around good time girl.

132
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:22,454
I'm here because my boss,
the United States of America,

133
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:25,406
thinks Sarah Connor
is a deluded, dangerous

134
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:27,152
Grade A wacko-mo

135
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:29,564
who killed a man because she believed
that in the future,

136
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:32,600
he will invent a computer system
that declares war on the world.

137
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,714
So...

138
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,667
let's start with her name, shall we?

139
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:42,113
I understand

140
00:10:43,157 --> 00:10:44,320
it's not Connor.

141
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:42,634
You'll be responsible
for three chapters a week,

142
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:44,270
you have a quiz each Friday,

143
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,171
you'll be allowed one makeup test
with a parent's note.

144
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,270
What's your name?

145
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:53,146
- John.
- Cameron.

146
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:57,144
And no talking while I'm talking.

147
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:06,086
John?

148
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:09,368
- Hey.
- Haven't seen you around here before.

149
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,251
- Did you just move here?
- Yeah.

150
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:13,615
Sucks for you.

151
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:17,241
My dad sells tractors.

152
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,481
- What about yours?
- Insurance.

153
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:21,361
Really? What kind?

154
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:24,019
Boring kind.

155
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:27,912
It's the kind of tractors my dad sells.

156
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:29,517
What about your mom?

157
00:12:30,873 --> 00:12:31,955
My mom stays home.

158
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,980
You know, I've really
got to get to the next class, so...

159
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:39,448
So...

160
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:41,271
Maybe I'll see you later?

161
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,718
Sure. Yeah.

162
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:46,576
Bye.

163
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:31,648
This is a hick town, mom.

164
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:33,927
We've been in worse places.

165
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:35,293
A lot worse.

166
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,742
All my clothes are wrong.

167
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:40,048
I need like...
some different shirts.

168
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:42,374
You know here,
everyone wears boots.

169
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:43,912
Like cow-boy boots.

170
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:45,867
Hate cow-boy boots!

171
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:48,668
I'll see what I can do.

172
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,208
Their computers are like
in the 40, 50's, or something.

173
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:53,652
Their computers?

174
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:56,152
- I thought we agreed?
- No, no, it wasn't my fault.

175
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:57,305
They switched my class.

176
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,344
Last thing I need
is you getting caught hacking.

177
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,612
I'm not hacking, mom.
God, I know the rules.

178
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:04,795
They're like, written on the inside
of my eyeballs, right?

179
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:21,184
Hey!

180
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:29,891
You meet any pretty girls?

181
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:32,872
No.

182
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,931
I'm telling you, it's a hick town.

183
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:43,115
Come on.

184
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,559
Agent Ellison.

185
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:08,106
Welcome to New Mexico.

186
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:21,034
The sheriff's detached me to hustle
you around in your business here,

187
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,945
whatever that is, he wouldn't say.

188
00:15:23,468 --> 00:15:24,797
He doesn't know.

189
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:43,734
I lied to you yesterday.

190
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:47,114
My dad doesn't sell insurance.

191
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:48,785
He's dead.

192
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,744
He was a soldier,
he was killed on a mission.

193
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:55,515
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,534
It's... it's all right. My mom

195
00:15:57,654 --> 00:16:00,250
was pregnant with me when it happened,
I never even knew him.

196
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,353
So, it's all right.

197
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,246
My mom...

198
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:07,815
she, she... she's kinda uptight.

199
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:09,688
Actually, no. She's...

200
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:13,083
She's really uptight. She likes me
to come home straight after school

201
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,849
and hang out wit her,
that kinda thing, you know?

202
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:18,355
I'm all she's got.

203
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,367
Thank you for explaining.

204
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:28,614
That'll be our secret.

205
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:40,034
Mr. Ferguson is ill today.

206
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,685
My name is Cromartie.

207
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,213
Is that your only name, like Madonna?

208
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:47,980
Madonna?

209
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,680
Why? No.

210
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,528
Let's take attendance, then.

211
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,700
- Mary Buoy?
- Here.

212
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,019
- Donald Chase?
- Yeah.

213
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,308
- Franklin Lane?
- Yeah.

214
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:11,637
- Cynthia Nolan?
- Here.

215
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:15,006
- Wayne Parker?
- Here.

216
00:17:16,023 --> 00:17:17,371
Cameron Philips?

217
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:21,263
Cameron?

218
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:23,880
Here.

219
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:27,304
Reese?

220
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,158
Do we have a John...

221
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:30,661
Reese?

222
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,584
Excellent.

223
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:03,748
Class dismissed.

224
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:47,849
<i>This breaking news just in.</i>

225
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:50,924
<i>Violence striking close to home
here in New Mexico.</i>

226
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:53,131
<i>Witnesses are reporting gun fire</i>

227
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:56,993
<i>just minutes ago, at Crest View
High School in Red Valley. Police...</i>

228
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,753
Come with me if you wanna live.

229
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,458
Now, the science teacher.

230
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,619
Very dead.

231
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:32,671
What about her?

232
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,565
She blew at the diner.

233
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,471
Into the wind.

234
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,887
Do you know why anyone
would wanna kill that boy?

235
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:43,572
No.

236
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,633
Someone wanted to kill that boy.

237
00:20:49,424 --> 00:20:50,470
Damn!

238
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:32,828
Sarah Connor.

239
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,058
Where is he?

240
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:35,828
What have you done with him?

241
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:42,554
You don't know.

242
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:44,190
You don't know.

243
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:46,931
Killing yourself is the best strategy.

244
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:50,387
If you're alive,
I can use you against him.

245
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,510
- John?
- <i>Hello, Mom? Mom?</i>

246
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:01,468
- I tried to call you.
- <i>I have been trying to call you!</i>

247
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:02,850
<i>Mom, it's back, you gotta...</i>

248
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:04,026
<i>All these kids...</i>

249
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:05,862
John, slow down.

250
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,934
- Where are you?
- <i>I'm going to the house.</i>

251
00:22:08,054 --> 00:22:09,521
- I'll be right there.
- <i>Mom.</i>

252
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:10,768
I love you.

253
00:22:11,026 --> 00:22:12,169
Stay right there.

254
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:35,433
John?

255
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,503
John?

256
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:45,344
- Are you OK?
- Mom?

257
00:22:45,737 --> 00:22:46,893
- John?
- Mom?

258
00:22:49,265 --> 00:22:50,275
John!

259
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:51,409
No!

260
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:52,843
John!

261
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:57,444
Neat trick.

262
00:22:57,564 --> 00:22:58,635
You like?

263
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:51,902
Next time you do
what you're trained to do!

264
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:53,562
You run! Go!

265
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,974
- Did you stop him?
- 120 seconds and the system reboots.

266
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,552
- I was sent here to protect John.
- Not now!

267
00:24:40,774 --> 00:24:41,806
Not yet!

268
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:33,400
You might want to put those back
in the holster.

269
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:40,824
We should be good here
two more hours.

270
00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:44,340
Hit the border at lunch time.

271
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,041
What year are you from?

272
00:25:49,372 --> 00:25:50,541
2027.

273
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:56,036
How long have you been looking for us?

274
00:25:56,713 --> 00:25:58,005
73 days.

275
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:01,405
And the war?

276
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:03,072
The Skynet Missile Defense System

277
00:26:03,192 --> 00:26:05,944
goes online April 19th, 2011,

278
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:10,289
declares war on mankind and triggers
a nuclear apocalypse two days later.

279
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,235
Miles Dyson died.

280
00:26:14,763 --> 00:26:16,423
Someone else built Skynet.

281
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:20,542
Who?

282
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:22,624
We don't know.

283
00:26:22,744 --> 00:26:25,346
You don't know who builds
the computer that blows up the world?

284
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:26,796
I wasn't sent here for that.

285
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:27,933
No.

286
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,802
You were sent here to keep
my son from being assassinated.

287
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:34,810
Your fiancé went to the police.

288
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:38,424
You should have changed your alias.

289
00:26:38,978 --> 00:26:40,195
Go to hell!

290
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:47,115
They'd have found you anyway.

291
00:26:47,578 --> 00:26:48,771
They always do.

292
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:17,719
It's kevlar in that chair.

293
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:21,115
APB's statewide but it's been...

294
00:27:21,235 --> 00:27:22,392
19 hours.

295
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,286
What the hell happened here?

296
00:27:28,527 --> 00:27:30,224
Like, why don't we have any bodies?

297
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:31,957
Where is the blood?

298
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:36,261
22 witnesses, deputy Ridge.

299
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,044
22 of your good town folk.

300
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:43,048
That's a whole football team.

301
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:45,384
Guess what 19 of them saw?

302
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:47,955
A shooter with some kind of robot leg.

303
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:49,270
A shooter

304
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,593
with some kind of robot leg...

305
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:30,084
Why is this happening again?

306
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:37,524
I don't know.

307
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:40,007
You stopped it.

308
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:43,634
I guess I didn't.

309
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:51,913
But you can.

310
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:58,053
Look, you changed the future.
You just didn't change it enough.

311
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,486
So you can do it again.

312
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:01,220
I don't know, John.

313
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:07,220
Because I can't keep running.
I can't keep doing this.

314
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,463
I'm not who they think I am, OK ?

315
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:16,149
Some messiah.

316
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,928
You don't know that.

317
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,925
I know.

318
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:25,704
I can't lead an army.

319
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:29,717
Maybe that's you but it'll never be me.
So you've got to stop it.

320
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,856
All right?

321
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:31,987
Please.

322
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:38,434
Mom.

323
00:29:43,555 --> 00:29:44,587
All right.

324
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,293
All right.

325
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:54,024
All right what?

326
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:55,973
I'll stop it.

327
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,312
We're not going across the border.

328
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:08,935
Where are we going?

329
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,321
To find Skynet.

330
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:28,540
<i>Two years ago, I had to tell Miles Dyson</i>

331
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,110
<i>his research at Cyberdyne
would lead to the birth of Skynet.</i>

332
00:30:32,234 --> 00:30:36,157
<i>I had to tell him he was the unknowing
father of a nuclear apocalypse.</i>

333
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,080
<i>He refused to accept his fate
and died trying to change it.</i>

334
00:30:40,682 --> 00:30:43,719
<i>And if I'm to have any chance
of tracking down Skynet again,</i>

335
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:47,618
<i>I have to tell his widow that
even though Miles changed his own fate,</i>

336
00:30:48,687 --> 00:30:50,323
<i>he didn't change ours.</i>

337
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:53,111
Sorry, Miles.

338
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:56,124
Mom! Pizza's here!

339
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,890
Mom! The pizza!

340
00:31:03,924 --> 00:31:04,981
Mom?

341
00:31:07,428 --> 00:31:09,678
- You!
- We need to talk about Miles, Theresa.

342
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:11,276
Danny, go to your room.

343
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:12,715
Right now.

344
00:31:13,994 --> 00:31:16,073
- How dare you come here?
- I know what they told you

345
00:31:16,193 --> 00:31:18,924
- but it didn't happen that way.
- Get the hell out of here.

346
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,010
- Now!
- It didn't happen that way.

347
00:31:26,106 --> 00:31:27,434
I can't let you do that.

348
00:31:27,704 --> 00:31:28,971
- Let go!
- Listen to me!

349
00:31:30,213 --> 00:31:31,491
I didn't kill Miles.

350
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:34,824
I didn't do it.

351
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:38,949
I would never.

352
00:31:40,104 --> 00:31:41,531
Miles was a hero.

353
00:31:42,354 --> 00:31:43,891
But why are you here?

354
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:46,166
We're back.

355
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,409
You told me there'd be no more machines.

356
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:06,250
It's happening again.
Everything we fought to stop.

357
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,986
Miles' work at Cyberdyne
is the only link we have.

358
00:32:10,106 --> 00:32:11,221
Is there anyone...

359
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:13,705
anywhere, who's shown
an interest in his work?

360
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:15,551
Anyone he could have told,
someone

361
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:16,802
he forgot.

362
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:19,009
There is nobody. It's all gone.

363
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:20,865
You destroyed it all.

364
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:23,423
You and Miles destroyed...

365
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,036
You destroyed everything.

366
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:34,380
We have to go.

367
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:36,016
Now!

368
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:52,688
Help me.

369
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,791
Help my son.

370
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:20,482
Mom!

371
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,128
Oh, God!

372
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:22,911
What time is it?

373
00:34:23,224 --> 00:34:24,429
7:52

374
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:26,715
How are you feeling?

375
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:28,449
Better.

376
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:30,679
Good.

377
00:34:31,786 --> 00:34:32,966
We need to go.

378
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:34,196
Where?

379
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,036
I'll show you.

380
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,633
Tell me what's going on.

381
00:34:42,753 --> 00:34:44,334
We're making a withdrawal.

382
00:34:48,182 --> 00:34:50,046
Do you have an account here ?

383
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,760
Safety deposit box.

384
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:53,382
When did you open that?

385
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,288
1963.

386
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:05,207
Everybody on the floor!

387
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:06,488
Please.

388
00:35:15,828 --> 00:35:17,745
Keys of the safety deposit boxes.

389
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:28,456
- Get inside.
- Keys.

390
00:35:33,804 --> 00:35:36,044
Lock us in, and then
get away from the door.

391
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,526
I'll know if you don't.

392
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,314
You said you had a safety deposit box.

393
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:56,257
I do.

394
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:20,932
Open these boxes.

395
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,781
Put everything you find on the table.

396
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:26,002
Carefully.

397
00:37:06,242 --> 00:37:07,362
Hey, James!

398
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:08,881
You gotta see this.

399
00:37:13,151 --> 00:37:15,087
The alarm tripped seven minutes ago.

400
00:37:15,714 --> 00:37:18,714
The camera dumped a digital copy
to the LAPD servers.

401
00:37:19,398 --> 00:37:20,594
Don't you know 'em?

402
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:24,553
Less and less all the time.

403
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:28,806
Is that from the future?

404
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:31,698
Can't bring anything through
when you come.

405
00:37:31,818 --> 00:37:34,217
No weapons, no clothing, nothing.

406
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,856
You sent someone back to build it.

407
00:37:43,046 --> 00:37:44,166
What is it?

408
00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:45,970
Hope.

409
00:38:14,512 --> 00:38:15,952
Is that the police?

410
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:18,139
- No. Get away from the door.
- Why?

411
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:21,671
That's why.

412
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:38,581
That'd better be what I think it is.

413
00:38:38,922 --> 00:38:40,498
One of our best engineers.

414
00:38:40,678 --> 00:38:42,539
To be made once he scavenged the parts.

415
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:44,950
When the isotope solution turns red,

416
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,962
- you can fire.
- Isotope...

417
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,192
- Is this nuclear?
- No, not really.

418
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,845
I don't get why you locked us in,
we didn't have to get trapped like rats.

419
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:02,005
We're not trapped.

420
00:39:11,446 --> 00:39:12,528
What is that?

421
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:14,845
Engineer got a job building the vault.

422
00:39:17,782 --> 00:39:20,080
So we'd always have a way back home.

423
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:30,173
What have you done?

424
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,496
You want to find Skynet?
You want to stop Skynet?

425
00:39:35,195 --> 00:39:37,746
- This is the way.
- You don't know who built it.

426
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:40,214
No. But we know where
and we know when.

427
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:42,296
We can go kill it before it's born.

428
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:45,030
We can stop running.
Stay in one place.

429
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,264
Fight.

430
00:40:12,836 --> 00:40:14,602
Mom!
We gotta go. Now!

431
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,881
Mom!

432
00:40:23,061 --> 00:40:24,067
Do it!

433
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:04,401
Where are we?

434
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:05,977
Same where.

435
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:07,856
Different when.

436
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:25,237
Check this out!

437
00:42:26,063 --> 00:42:27,427
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

438
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:30,323
Hey, baby.
I got something for you.

439
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:49,024
So this is where it all starts?

440
00:42:50,714 --> 00:42:52,176
This is where Skynet begins?

441
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,441
Somewhere in there.

442
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:58,991
And nobody knows we're here?

443
00:43:10,192 --> 00:43:11,293
You're safe.

444
00:43:14,464 --> 00:43:16,353
- No one is ever safe.
- No one is ever safe.

445
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:26,849
Come on.

446
00:43:36,926 --> 00:43:39,679
<i>It is said that the death
of any one person</i>

447
00:43:39,812 --> 00:43:41,920
<i>is the death of an entire world.</i>

448
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,809
<i>Certainly for parents,</i>

449
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:47,199
<i>the death of a child
is no less than a holocaust.</i>

450
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:48,906
<i>In the case of my son,</i>

451
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,241
<i>these words are literally true.</i>

452
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:55,442
<i>And finally tonight, an amateur video
of what we can only assume</i>

453
00:43:55,562 --> 00:43:57,454
<i>is a college prank gone wrong.</i>

454
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,765
Hi! Did you hear me?

455
00:44:02,296 --> 00:44:03,346
We're late.

456
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:05,827
- Come on, babe.
- I heard you, were late.

457
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,415
<i>And even though
we've traveled through time,</i>

458
00:44:08,535 --> 00:44:09,757
<i>bent the rules of nature...</i>

459
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:13,759
<i>In the end,</i>

460
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:15,734
<i>no one lives forever.</i>

461
00:44:18,012 --> 00:44:19,930
<i>They will keep coming for him,</i>

462
00:44:20,651 --> 00:44:22,379
<i>keep trying to kill him.</i>

463
00:44:23,547 --> 00:44:25,085
<i>But until that day,</i>

464
00:44:27,506 --> 00:44:29,794
<i>it's gonna be a goddamn dogfight.</i>

465
