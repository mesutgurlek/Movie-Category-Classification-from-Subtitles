1
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:38,999
<i>Vor uns liegt Deutschland...</i>

2
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:44,684
<i>...in uns marschiert Deutschland,
und hinter uns kommt Deutschland!</i>

3
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:10,166
<i>Feuer!</i>

4
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:06,635
<i>Please! He's my son!</i>

5
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:11,718
Mama! Mama!

6
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:14,844
Mama! Mama! Mama!

7
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:33,043
- What do we do?
- Shut up.

8
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:35,800
We've got to get home. Go!

9
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:44,678
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

10
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:48,165
Oh, my!

11
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,358
<i>Papa!</i>

12
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:16,078
<i>Aron.</i>

13
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,926
Come. It's safe.

14
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:57,317
Let's go.

15
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,317
<i>Stop it.</i>

16
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:14,002
<i>Asael! Stop it!</i>

17
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,518
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

18
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:25,485
You want to cry? Stop! Stop!

19
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:38,680
Let's go. Aron. Let's go.

20
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,680
Tuvia! It's Tuvia.

21
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:16,486
If I was a German, you would be dead.

22
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:23,437
- Papa and Mama... They killed them!
- I know.

23
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:30,878
Aron.

24
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:37,480
Big brother returns.

25
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:43,966
You saw them?

26
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:08,161
<i>Where is your wife and child?</i>

27
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:12,240
Horodyszcze. Hiding in a cellar.
I'll bring them when it is safe.

28
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:14,921
- And Rifka?
- Novogrudok.

29
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,397
- She wouldn't leave.
- You are still...

30
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:21,923
- She's still my wife.
- A rich wife.

31
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:26,564
Tell me, Tuvia,
why have you come back?

32
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:30,405
- Do you have a plan?
- No.

33
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:33,126
Do you?

34
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:41,361
- The police will be after us.
- We've run from them our whole life.

35
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:44,598
- You think this is a good time to stop?
- We know these woods.

36
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,803
They'll never find us in here.

37
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:51,125
Aron!

38
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:54,525
Aron!

39
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,876
I told him to stay here.

40
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:19,002
I miss Papa.

41
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,679
I can't believe he's dead.

42
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:30,875
- Bernicki.
- We don't know he did it.

43
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,520
- The police captain?
- He always had it in for Papa.

44
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:37,644
- But we don't know that he did it.
- So we will go and ask him.

45
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,843
Koscik has a pistol. He showed me once.

46
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:43,203
One pistol is nothing.
We need rifles, machine guns.

47
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:46,324
- You'll take on the whole German army?
- Just because...

48
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:54,204
- The child is hurt.
- Please, lay her down here.

49
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,760
Tuvia.

50
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:45,916
We cannot feed them.

51
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,318
- I'll go ask Koscik for food.
- And the pistol.

52
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:52,805
And the pistol.

53
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:14,117
I only have four bullets.

54
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:23,121
Thank you.

55
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,165
Your father was a good man.

56
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:29,686
<i>He said the same of you.</i>

57
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,765
Ignore the bitch. To the dead.

58
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:36,320
God rest their souls.

59
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:49,640
I live with this. Can you imagine?

60
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:54,596
The barn.

61
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,242
<i>Oh, God!</i>

62
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,005
Be quiet!

63
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:29,318
Ah!

64
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:04,323
- I'm sorry, they have to go with you.
- What am I supposed to do with them?

65
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:13,360
Those policemen... were they the ones
who killed my parents?

66
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:24,486
You people. Why is it so fucking hard
being friends with a Jew?

67
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:27,920
Try being one.

68
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:36,446
<i>- Who is he?
- Come on.</i>

69
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:39,678
Thank you. Come. Come.

70
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:49,605
You sat at the back, in school.
I am Shimon H'aretz.

71
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:53,362
<i>- I thought you were dead.
- I am at least half dead.</i>

72
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:57,156
I heard you speaking of your parents.
I am very sorry.

73
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:01,278
The other brothers.
What was his name, the wild one?

74
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:05,155
- Zus. He's with the other two.
- You are hiding here in the forest?

75
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:12,924
There has been trouble before, maybe?
With the police?

76
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:16,443
So you go to the forest. A wise choice.

77
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:19,439
A wise choice... For a stupid schoolboy.

78
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:23,202
My whole life, I presumed to teach
others the right way to live.

79
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:26,438
I had no doubt.
"This is God's way, this isn't."

80
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:31,362
You'll forgive me if recent events
have somewhat shaken my resolve.

81
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:36,077
Just like school. I have no idea
what you are talking about.

82
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,078
Please, let's go.

83
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,046
Here. You're not hungry?

84
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:04,925
Your little one does not talk.

85
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:08,486
He saw things.

86
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:21,521
I send you for food
and you bring more mouths to feed.

87
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:24,360
- You send me?
- Oh, please.

88
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:28,915
It was Bernicki who killed Papa.

89
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:32,918
Did you at least get the pistol?

90
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:36,038
Only four bullets.

91
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:38,595
Then, we'll have to make them count.

92
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:12,326
For my parents, David and Beila Bielski.

93
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,399
For my brothers, and for all the others.

94
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,285
Shit!

95
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:38,283
- Only one left.
- His sons.

96
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,278
How was it?

97
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,922
- How was what?
- To kill them.

98
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,358
- It was good, no?
- Shut up.

99
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:00,957
- And what about these others?
- I don't know.

100
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:04,198
Women will slow us down.
Your old teacher...

101
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:08,166
What, you afraid he's gonna spank you
for forgetting your homework?

102
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:16,561
We have to be able to move, Tuvia,
and quickly.

103
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:18,956
I agree. But they're here.

104
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:27,840
We'll sleep further up the trail. If
someone comes, they'll find them first...

105
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:30,441
...and the gunshots
should give us time to escape.

106
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:33,963
Alright... But no more.

107
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,965
No more.

108
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,718
I know. I know!

109
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:50,077
Tamara, you remember Cousin Zus.
Please, go and sit by the fire.

110
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,397
- Lazar. He's Isabel's youngest.
- Hello.

111
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:55,047
- And this is Isaac Malbin.
- Hello.

112
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,355
- He's from Minsk.
- Tuvia.

113
00:19:56,447 --> 00:20:00,156
- Asael! Find them something to eat.
- I have pity for them all, but...

114
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:02,920
- They're family!
- And how will we feed this family?

115
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:04,679
We'll water the soup.

116
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:11,442
And this one... She is family?

117
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:13,518
- No.
- Oh.

118
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:26,436
<i>Whoa!</i>

119
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:30,440
What the fuck?
Have you never used a hammer before?

120
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:34,122
- Er... No.
- What is it you do?

121
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:40,924
I suppose you'd have to say I was,
am, an intellectual.

122
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:44,997
<i>This is a job?</i>

123
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:47,476
I published a small magazine.

124
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,762
- Ah.
- Actually, a journal.

125
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:52,759
- Hm.
- More like a pamphlet.

126
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:54,485
<i>Tuvia?</i>

127
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:59,081
This is Lila. Lila is my forest wife.

128
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,158
I see.

129
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:05,602
Congratulations.

130
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:09,599
Interesting concept.

131
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:12,121
As long as his village wife
stays in hiding.

132
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:26,002
- Hello, boys. What can we do for you?
- Food. We want food.

133
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:32,839
These little shits are holding us up.
Do you have the balls to shoot me?

134
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:34,645
We have food. We'll share.

135
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,924
No. I want to see if the little shit
has the balls to shoot me.

136
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,475
You like to shoot Jews, little shit?
Huh?

137
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,956
- You are Jews?
- No, we're the Gestapo.

138
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:45,800
- Put down the gun.
- Before I shove it up your ass.

139
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,560
- Hey! Look at me! Where you from?
- Horodyszcze.

140
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:53,800
We haven't eaten in two days.
My name is Paretz.

141
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,479
This is Jacov.

142
00:21:56,287 --> 00:22:00,803
Two days ago there were 3,000 Jews
in Horodyszcze. And now... There are 50.

143
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:03,242
Me and him, we hid in a wall.

144
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,842
Do you know a woman... Sonia Bielski?

145
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:12,755
We knew her.

146
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,479
There was a child.

147
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,646
My child...
I should have protected them!

148
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:11,400
- No.
- I... Sonia!

149
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,920
Mama!

150
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:22,841
Papa!

151
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:29,801
- So many dead!
- I know.

152
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:31,756
Why not us?

153
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,319
I don't know.

154
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,162
Better to be hiding in the woods...

155
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,598
...like rabbits...

156
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:46,000
...hunted. No.

157
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:55,118
We're looking for partisans.
What is the name of your otriad?

158
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:57,562
- What is an otriad?
- It's an armed brigade.

159
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,445
We heard the Russians
are beginning to organise.

160
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:03,405
- Here?
- And also in Lipicanska.

161
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:06,957
Then we are the Bielski Otriad.
You want to join?

162
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:11,044
- The Russians are fighters.
- But you need a gun to join them.

163
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:13,436
They sabotage railroads
and kill Germans.

164
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:17,076
You want to kill Germans?
Come with me.

165
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,125
Unless you're still afraid
to use that rifle.

166
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:22,198
Stay there. Stay there!

167
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:27,477
We must get what we need
without killing.

168
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:32,083
- This will not bring your family back.
- Blood for blood.

169
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:35,567
- You had yours.
- And I can still see their faces.

170
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:40,198
- "Vengeance is mine." Who said that?
- This is God's work you're doing now?

171
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:43,199
No, only you can do that.
Take a few lives, spare others.

172
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:46,484
- We must not become like them.
- No, but we can kill like them.

173
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:50,885
Are you coming with us or not?

174
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,681
It's coming! It's coming!

175
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:03,485
Truck!

176
00:26:04,447 --> 00:26:06,165
Hurry, hurry! Go!

177
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:10,566
Here!

178
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:07,119
Hey!

179
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:24,075
<i>Nein! Nein!</i>

180
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:30,806
<i>Hey, I got one!</i>

181
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:46,196
A- Ha!

182
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:50,202
- Vodka!
- Hey, now we are real partisans!

183
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:53,279
<i>To the Bielski Otriad!</i>

184
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,358
Cigarettes!

185
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,445
Asael!

186
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:17,756
<i>Asael!</i>

187
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:25,999
Get his rifle!

188
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:49,756
Shit! He's going the wrong way!

189
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:09,037
- Come on!
- We can't just leave him!

190
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:12,005
We have no choice! Go!

191
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:14,362
- Asael!
- No! No!

192
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:04,565
They thought you were bringing food.
Farmers stop you?

193
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:08,837
- Hm? They had guns? Dogs?
- No.

194
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:13,357
<i>I don't understand.</i>

195
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:17,759
The Talmud says, if you save a life,
you must take responsibility for it.

196
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:20,281
Again, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

197
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:24,440
Oh, yes. I think you do.
And now your little brother is gone.

198
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,525
- How did you get past Lazar?
- Who?

199
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:37,275
Fucking shit...
You worthless piece of shit!

200
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,085
<i>Enough!</i>

201
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:41,840
He walked by you!
Someone could have been killed!

202
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:44,760
I said enough! Get up! Get up!

203
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:47,919
He should be shot. If we
were real partisans, he'd be shot...

204
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:50,282
...you stupid little piece of!

205
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,446
He made a mistake!

206
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:56,446
Mistake?

207
00:30:57,207 --> 00:31:00,040
- We cannot make mistakes, Tuvia.
- Like last night, Zus.

208
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,038
First they will torture Asael...

209
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:06,199
...and then they will hang him.

210
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,959
You are Tuvia Bielski?

211
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:17,002
- You know me?
- We heard of you in Vilna.

212
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:19,726
- My sister lives in Vilna!
- My family is there!

213
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:22,799
- The SD came without warning.
- Oh, God!

214
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:27,005
<i>Oh, God! Oh, God!</i>

215
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:30,875
- We'll be better off in the ghetto!
- At least here we are safe.

216
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:33,276
- There, we had had hope.
- Here we have hope!

217
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:34,846
- Do we?
- We have no food!

218
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,919
- Tomorrow will be another mission.
- Like last time?

219
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:40,999
- We won't make that mistake again.
- How do you know?

220
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,920
<i>We may be here a long time.</i>

221
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:45,918
- We have to prepare.
- How?

222
00:31:46,007 --> 00:31:48,680
Better security,
better at getting food...

223
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,645
We don't have weapons.
People are getting sick.

224
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:05,405
Whatever it takes,
we all have to participate!

225
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:08,718
<i>We can't work against each other!</i>

226
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:28,046
We cannot afford revenge. Not now!

227
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:33,006
We cannot afford to lose friends
like Jacov and Peretz.

228
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:34,520
Or Asael.

229
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,478
We cannot lose anyone.

230
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:11,682
We will map out where we have been...

231
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:15,321
...so as not to visit
the same farms too often...

232
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:18,444
...and we will take only from those
who can afford to give...

233
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:21,485
...and we will leave those who can't alone.

234
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:24,045
Our revenge...

235
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:27,885
...is to live.
- The poorest farmer has more than us.

236
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:31,437
Quiet. What I am saying is,
we are not thieves or murderers.

237
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:36,957
We may be hunted like animals,
but we will not become animals.

238
00:33:38,887 --> 00:33:40,400
We have all chosen this...

239
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,923
...to live here free, like human beings,
for as long as we can.

240
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:49,565
Every day of freedom
is like an act of faith.

241
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:55,043
And if we should die,
trying to live...

242
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,806
...then at least we die
like human beings.

243
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:26,522
Thank God. Come here! Come here!

244
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:29,326
Come, Asael!

245
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:36,159
<i>Zus... Zus, I can't breathe.</i>

246
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:40,001
I can't breathe.
Look. Look. Look what we found.

247
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:41,998
Where did you get these?

248
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:43,756
Hello.

249
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:48,602
- It is alright. Please come.
- Please.

250
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:51,155
<i>- It is alright.
- Come on.</i>

251
00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:52,475
Give me that.

252
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:59,726
- Asael, you've been busy!
- Shut up.

253
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,959
Hello. I am Zus.

254
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:04,800
This is Bella and this is Chaya.

255
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:07,560
- Please, come. You must be hungry.
- Thank you.

256
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,884
And then, we fell into
this horrible bog...

257
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:23,435
...and Chaya saved me. I can't swim at all.

258
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:28,078
- Well, we'll have to teach you.
- We must have got lost a dozen times.

259
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:31,876
I was resigned to die. Tell him, Chaya.
Was it not the absolute worst?

260
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:34,879
- And that farmer, a Mr er...
- Koscik.

261
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:37,356
Yes.
He kept making the most vulgar jokes.

262
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:44,560
So you're trying to tell me
that all politics is meaningless?

263
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:47,241
In the West,
the monster with the little moustache.

264
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:50,603
In the East, the monster with
the big moustache. That is politics.

265
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:53,565
Your Messiah will have a moustache,
too, and a full beard.

266
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:56,764
No. The messiahs are all in politics,
and they are killing us.

267
00:36:56,847 --> 00:37:00,726
- No...
- What's killing me is all your talking.

268
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:09,357
<i>And Roosevelt?
He has no moustache.</i>

269
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:11,244
We need to know about the villages...

270
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:13,761
...where the Germans are,
who the informers are.

271
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:18,482
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes. Yes.

272
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,325
- What's her name?
- Chaya.

273
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,956
Chaya!

274
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,241
What are you doing?

275
00:37:30,327 --> 00:37:31,965
- Talk to her.
- I hardly know her.

276
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:34,117
You spent three days in a cellar
with her.

277
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:36,437
Malbin says
the Piznarski granary is full.

278
00:37:36,527 --> 00:37:39,405
- But we still need two guns at least.
- Whose turn is it to go?

279
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:42,001
- Zus.
- You go with him.

280
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:43,759
Make sure he understands my orders.

281
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:48,637
Go! Go and talk to her! Go!

282
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,080
Hello. How are you?

283
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:56,316
- Fine.
- Good.

284
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:07,078
Ssh...

285
00:38:25,087 --> 00:38:29,524
Leave half. He cannot go to the
Germans empty-handed. Tuvia's orders.

286
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:50,201
Halt! Who goes there?

287
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,597
You know who goes there, Lazar.
We go there.

288
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:57,157
You only say "Who goes there?"
When you don't know who goes there.

289
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:00,237
Sorry, Zus.

290
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:03,637
Milk! And eggs! Chaya, our brave men
have brought us a feast.

291
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:06,525
<i>You can make me blintzes.</i>

292
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:10,646
Hey... Hey! I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

293
00:39:10,727 --> 00:39:12,957
- Hello.
- Arkady Lubczanski.

294
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:14,924
- You are Chaya.
- Yes.

295
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:18,522
You're getting along alright?
Anything you need? An extra blanket?

296
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,121
Er, no, thank you. I am fine.

297
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:26,042
- Oh. Something nice... And soft?
- No, it is alright.

298
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:29,636
You don't have a husband yet.

299
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:31,922
- Yet?
- A forest husband.

300
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:36,239
All the other women have chosen
already. They haven't told you?

301
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:39,478
No, they haven't.
Thank you for explaining it.

302
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:42,604
Descartes provided for
the subjective nature of experience.

303
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:45,884
Yes. You annoy me, therefore I exist.

304
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,958
Ben Zion?

305
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:57,761
The new ones have just arrived.
They are from Novogrudok.

306
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,720
Your wife...
They say she was killed last week.

307
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:07,043
I'm sorry.

308
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:16,045
Thank you for telling me.

309
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,161
Can I join you?

310
00:40:58,087 --> 00:40:59,998
Of course.

311
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:14,163
- Oh, I... I never...
- You never what?

312
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:29,960
Do you get lonely out here?

313
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:33,521
I like the woods.

314
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:37,996
I get a little bit scared sometimes.

315
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:45,685
Tell me something. Why is there a rule
against women having guns?

316
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:49,559
- There aren't enough for the men.
- Women need guns, too.

317
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:51,795
What for?

318
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:55,715
For... Protection.

319
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:59,198
Women have men for protection.

320
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:10,238
I want protection.

321
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:57,997
<i>Men with guns! Men with guns! Up!</i>

322
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:03,764
Take weapons and ammunition only!

323
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,680
- Lova, Ben Zion, with us. Asael!
- Yes!

324
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,361
Keep them moving! Don't stop!
Keep them moving!

325
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:12,280
Go, go. Move! Come on!
Quickly, quickly!

326
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:13,595
Zus! No!

327
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:23,801
Quick, quick.

328
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:38,480
Come!

329
00:43:43,047 --> 00:43:46,722
<i>Don't stop till you reach the fields!</i>

330
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:49,879
- Move, move!
- Keep them moving. Zus! Asael!

331
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:51,844
Ben Zion, there!

332
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:44,806
Give up Bielski,
and the rest of you can go free!

333
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:48,277
You're from Belorussia! Why do
you work against your own people?

334
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:51,518
For the same reason
you steal from the poor!

335
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,006
To survive!

336
00:44:55,327 --> 00:44:58,125
- Shit!
- Next one's to the head!

337
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:03,842
It will be dark soon.
How will you find your way home then?

338
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:25,396
They'll be back.
We will have to build a new camp.

339
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:30,196
- Next time you can draw them a map.
- And what does that mean?

340
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:33,245
It means we should have killed
the fucking milkman.

341
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:35,921
Your policy of diplomacy is shit.

342
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:40,158
Winter is coming,
and now we have no shelter. Why?

343
00:45:41,127 --> 00:45:44,278
Because you don't have the stomach
to do what must be done.

344
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:52,678
Go! Move.

345
00:46:52,127 --> 00:46:55,802
Where is he taking us?
My feet are going to fall off.

346
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,721
I need volunteers for a scouting party.

347
00:47:48,727 --> 00:47:49,921
Ah!

348
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,763
- So now we are partisans.
- We'll see.

349
00:50:06,487 --> 00:50:08,876
- Here.
- Thank you.

350
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:12,243
If my friends at the New Socialist Club
could see me now!

351
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:14,204
I haven't read a book in months.

352
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:16,439
I don't read much.

353
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,517
- You can ask Shimon.
- I did.

354
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:24,365
- Yet you accept me as commander?
- Who else?

355
00:50:27,927 --> 00:50:31,681
- Might I make an observation?
- Please! Observe away.

356
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:35,041
We need to be strong, yes. But...

357
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:38,485
But?

358
00:50:39,247 --> 00:50:43,399
- Other things are important, too.
- Such as?

359
00:50:44,887 --> 00:50:46,081
Community.

360
00:50:49,527 --> 00:50:53,725
You have ideas about, er...
about community?

361
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:56,115
A few.

362
00:51:00,847 --> 00:51:03,042
Oh! More mouths to feed.

363
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:06,244
And more young bodies
to keep us warm.

364
00:51:13,807 --> 00:51:16,879
- Which one is Tuvia Bielski?
- Tuvia!

365
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:20,238
I'm Tuvia.

366
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:23,446
Hello.

367
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:25,643
None of us knew if you really existed.

368
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:29,995
Excuse me.
My name is Yitzhak Shulman.

369
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,885
- Welcome, Yitzhak.
- I am from Baranowicze.

370
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,316
The ghetto is being liquidated.

371
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,643
The Germans said everyone
will be executed if anyone is missing.

372
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:46,039
So the council stops us
from leaving. But, er...

373
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:50,524
...every day, more people are killed.

374
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:53,438
My parents!

375
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,756
- We will do what we can.
- Thank you.

376
00:51:59,847 --> 00:52:00,962
No!

377
00:52:01,047 --> 00:52:02,844
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

378
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:10,686
- Please, will you help my parents?
- I, er...

379
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:12,166
I've seen you looking at me.

380
00:52:12,247 --> 00:52:14,886
If you were to rescue them,
I will do anything for you.

381
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:17,435
- No!
- Anything. Please!

382
00:52:17,527 --> 00:52:20,678
And what does it mean,
"do what we can"?

383
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:24,123
We will send for everyone
who is left alive.

384
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:27,722
- And if there are hundreds, Tuvia?
- Then we will provide.

385
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:30,321
And when the Germans
follow these hundreds?

386
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:32,602
- I won't let that happen.
- You won't?

387
00:52:32,687 --> 00:52:35,485
- No. I will bring them out myself.
- From the ghetto?

388
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:38,240
- Yes!
- So, now you are Moses, huh?

389
00:52:39,847 --> 00:52:43,760
- Go back to work. You're wasting time.
- I'm not the one who's wasting time.

390
00:52:43,847 --> 00:52:46,645
I cannot have you questioning me
in front of the others.

391
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:52,205
- We're family. We stick together.
- Why?

392
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:55,962
So we can die alongside
these... Malbushim?

393
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:59,642
- Don't call them that. They're Jews.
- Pretentious Jews.

394
00:52:59,727 --> 00:53:01,638
Jews who stuck up their noses at us.

395
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:06,879
Jews who would lock their daughters
away from our dirty hands.

396
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:09,843
You are nothing to them, Tuvia.

397
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:13,476
They only follow you because they're
too weak to fight for themselves.

398
00:53:15,327 --> 00:53:16,601
And what about Bella?

399
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:20,046
She'd be with you
if this wasn't happening?

400
00:53:22,247 --> 00:53:24,124
- Don't.
- Is it love, Zus?

401
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:41,715
Tuvia...

402
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:27,441
Tuvia!

403
00:54:58,287 --> 00:55:01,279
Lova, Ben Zion...

404
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:06,479
And anyone else who'd rather fight
than wait to be killed...

405
00:55:08,407 --> 00:55:10,921
...we're leaving to join those who fight.

406
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:17,446
Are you coming?

407
00:55:20,647 --> 00:55:21,682
No.

408
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:41,758
<i>We are not so naive to think
they won't kill some of us...</i>

409
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:45,237
...but all the Jews? It makes no sense.

410
00:56:45,327 --> 00:56:49,605
They need us to work in the factories,
in the labour camps.

411
00:56:49,687 --> 00:56:51,086
They're death camps.

412
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:56,446
We, too, have heard of such places.

413
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,597
But have you seen them yourself?

414
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:04,156
Can you tell me with absolute certainty
that we won't just as likely die.

415
00:57:04,247 --> 00:57:07,364
...out there with you in the woods,
with winter coming on?

416
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:15,116
Do you think we haven't all considered
running away?

417
00:57:15,207 --> 00:57:18,005
For every one who leaves, they kill 20.

418
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:21,477
How can I sacrifice thousands
for the sake of a few?

419
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:24,806
What if we take you all?

420
00:57:26,607 --> 00:57:29,326
The old? The sick? How will we live?

421
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:32,797
We will protect you. We have alliances
with Russian partisans.

422
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:37,358
They're as bad as the Germans!
You're too young to know the pogroms.

423
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:40,996
Our only weapon is time.

424
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:43,362
If I can buy more, we will have won.

425
00:57:43,447 --> 00:57:46,120
You want time?

426
00:57:46,207 --> 00:57:49,244
Fine. I'll give you time.

427
00:57:49,327 --> 00:57:53,718
A day, a month, maybe even a year.
To live.

428
00:57:56,687 --> 00:57:59,121
Your daughter, Chaya. She is with us.

429
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,400
Your husband is waiting for you.

430
00:58:03,487 --> 00:58:05,876
Rabbi... Rabbi, please.

431
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:08,083
We're waiting for God.

432
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,278
<i>I am going.</i>

433
00:58:20,127 --> 00:58:23,805
<i>I am going.</i>

434
00:58:24,887 --> 00:58:26,240
I am going.

435
00:58:27,847 --> 00:58:29,075
<i>Me, too.</i>

436
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,480
Wait.

437
00:58:57,807 --> 00:58:59,718
Come on. Come.

438
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,684
Move forward! Come along, please!
Come forward!

439
00:59:28,767 --> 00:59:31,964
Please have your valuables out
and ready. Keep moving.

440
00:59:32,047 --> 00:59:34,436
Come! We're not going to bite you.

441
00:59:36,247 --> 00:59:37,805
Mama! Papa!

442
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:44,083
- Ah! What about you, Tateh?
- I am a watchmaker.

443
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,919
Can you repair guns?

444
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:51,637
- The trigger.
- Maybe.

445
00:59:53,487 --> 00:59:56,957
Come forward. Have your things out
and ready. Please...

446
00:59:58,927 --> 01:00:02,363
- They were my grandmother's.
- And now they belong to the Otriad.

447
01:00:02,447 --> 01:00:05,200
Everyone sacrifices
for the sake of the collective!

448
01:00:05,287 --> 01:00:07,721
We can trade this
for food or weapons. Next!

449
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,286
How about carpenters?

450
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:12,484
- Any bootmakers? Seamstresses?
- I am an accountant.

451
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:16,166
- Well, that should come in handy!
- Alright!

452
01:00:21,647 --> 01:00:24,400
<i>You have a new profession.</i>

453
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,603
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

454
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:29,359
- Next!
- I am a shoemaker.

455
01:00:29,447 --> 01:00:32,325
- Good. You are welcome.
- Yes, please?

456
01:00:32,407 --> 01:00:36,958
- I am a nurse.
- Ah! Good. You are most welcome.

457
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:40,919
Friends!
This is the happiest day of my life...

458
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:44,556
...to see you here, safely amongst us.

459
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:48,325
But there are a few things
you must learn about living here.

460
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:55,239
When you are rested and settled,
you will be assigned work duties.

461
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:57,602
Everyone will work.
There are no exceptions.

462
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:01,236
We will help supply
our Russian partisan comrades.

463
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:04,763
We will mend clothes.
We will repair weapons.

464
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:08,681
Women will learn to shoot,
and they will fight alongside men.

465
01:01:10,127 --> 01:01:11,924
Pregnancies are forbidden.

466
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:15,044
We cannot accommodate
an infant's needs here.

467
01:01:20,647 --> 01:01:25,880
Today... we will start rebuilding
the lives you have all lost.

468
01:01:30,447 --> 01:01:35,077
This is the one place in all
of Belorussia where a Jew can be free.

469
01:01:40,127 --> 01:01:42,436
We welcome you into our community.

470
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:53,805
- He is a Jew?
- Yes.

471
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:57,682

01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:06,599
This is not a gun!
To you, it is Bar Kochba's spear.

473
01:02:06,687 --> 01:02:10,202
It is Samson's jawbone.
It is Ehud's sword.

474
01:02:11,407 --> 01:02:14,922
It is the slingshot young David used
to bring down the monster Goliath.

475
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:18,558
And we will become warriors...

476
01:02:20,047 --> 01:02:23,357
...like the Maccabees and the Sicarii...

477
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:27,076
...brave men and women
fighting for their freedom.

478
01:02:28,647 --> 01:02:29,875
As they were.

479
01:02:32,407 --> 01:02:33,601
Fire!

480
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,159
Good.

481
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,726
Boom!

482
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:36,077
Now, this here... This is a knight.

483
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:39,000
It can move one, two, forward,
and one to the side.

484
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:43,846
Yesterday potato with beets,
today beets with potatoes...

485
01:03:43,927 --> 01:03:45,963
Tomorrow, special treat. Potato soup.

486
01:03:46,047 --> 01:03:50,086
Stop complaining, you wenches,
and keep mashing.

487
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:53,318
- We love potatoes, don't we, boys?
- Yes, sir!

488
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:55,443
We like latkes, blintzes...

489
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:59,156
Thank you! Sit down.
Put some hairs on your chest.

490
01:04:00,367 --> 01:04:02,676
If you want to be a soldier, you drink!

491
01:04:03,647 --> 01:04:06,036
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

492
01:04:06,127 --> 01:04:08,595
<i>He's having a little drink.</i>

493
01:04:09,687 --> 01:04:12,997
So... A little bird told me.

494
01:04:13,087 --> 01:04:16,602
...that a certain someone is waiting
for another certain someone.

495
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,882
...to ask a certain question.

496
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:32,917
- Hello, Chaya.
- Hello, Asael.

497
01:04:33,007 --> 01:04:34,281
- Let me take it.
- No, no.

498
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:37,200
- Are you sure?
- I am fine. Thank you.

499
01:04:42,847 --> 01:04:44,326
May I help you?

500
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:49,525
Chaya, I was wondering if...
maybe...

501
01:04:49,607 --> 01:04:51,518
...you... I mean...

502
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:54,804
...you and I... if... we...

503
01:04:54,887 --> 01:04:57,924
- I accept.
- You do?

504
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:00,802
I do.

505
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:11,797
<i>Blessed art Thou, our God,
king of the universe...</i>

506
01:05:11,887 --> 01:05:14,196
...who created man in His own image...

507
01:05:15,247 --> 01:05:21,595
...and out of Himself fashioned
for us a lasting place.

508
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:25,043
Blessed art Thou, our God,
king of the universe...

509
01:05:25,127 --> 01:05:28,244
...who created all things for His glory.

510
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:32,440
Oh, gladden these loving mates.

511
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:36,964
...as Thou did anciently gladden
Thy creatures in Eden.

512
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:40,042
<i>Blessed art Thou, O God...</i>

513
01:05:40,127 --> 01:05:44,040
...who gladdens the bridegroom
and the bride.

514
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:47,881
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

515
01:06:05,407 --> 01:06:08,399
With this ring
you are consecrated to me.

516
01:06:08,487 --> 01:06:11,240
...according to the law of Moses
and Israel.

517
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:28,806
<i>Mazel tov!</i>
