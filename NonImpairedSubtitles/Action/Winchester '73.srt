00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:35,419
[ Man ]
Uh, 7.58, 9.

303
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,717
I went for the whole kit.

304
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:43,194
We'll take three six-guns
and some 44-40s
for my Winchester!

305
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:47,255
What'll it be?
$300!

306
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:50,324
Three hundred?
Why, you two-bit thief!

307
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,461
I ought to wrap 'em
around your neck!

308
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:55,996
A six-gun doesn't bring
better than $25
anywhere in the territory!

309
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,269
- Does for me!
- Why--

310
00:24:58,343 --> 00:25:02,404
Wait a minute, Dutch!
You got no call
to insult this gentleman!

311
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:04,915
Gentleman!
All right! So he's
an Indian trader!

312
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:08,043
I know of a lot
worse things!
What, for instance?

313
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,486
That you're not gonna get
the price down that way!

314
00:25:10,556 --> 00:25:15,118
I'm sick and tired
of goin' around naked!
Dutch, we need guns!

315
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:17,128
We got $82!
What'll that bring?

316
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,762
Mind if I look
at your Winchester?

317
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,579
I can use
a four-pound steak!
Or will that cost 300?

318
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,580
No, I get my beef cheap!

319
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:39,583
Have one on the house
while you're waiting!

320
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:42,916
One of a Thousand!

321
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:46,515
I've heard of'em,
but this is the first I see!

322
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:57,831
Play your red six
on the black seven!

323
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:03,774
The red six!
[ Chuckles ]

324
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,776
Thanks!

325
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:08,608
I'm not much of a hand
at cards!

326
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,946
Just killin' a little time
until Young Bull
sends his man down!

327
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:16,613
Yes, sir,
that's a real fine gun!

328
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,622
Don't suppose
you wanna sell?

329
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,682
I'm buyin', not sellin'!

330
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,694
Your black jack
on the queen!

331
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:25,696
What's Young Bull doin'
this far north?

332
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:28,460
I wouldn't know!
But he wants guns!

333
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,798
They all want repeaters
since the Little Big Horn!

334
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,169
Thought I'd clean up
and get out!

335
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,698
Might go ranchin'
up Montana way!

336
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:40,711
What happened
at Little Big Horn?

337
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:43,179
Haven't you heard?
Sioux jumped Custer!

338
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:46,615
Wiped out his whole command!

339
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:50,177
Yes, sir, gettin' to be mighty
tough country to travel!!!

340
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:53,053
without a gun!

341
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,059
So I see!

342
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,793
Now, that gun there,

343
00:26:58,864 --> 00:27:01,765
I'd be willing to give you
300 in gold!!!

344
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,994
and let you take your pick
of six-guns and repeaters!

345
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:08,365
Might even throw in
50 rounds of shells!

346
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:12,101
Move your king over
and get 'em all up!

347
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:16,513
I'm not tradin'!

348
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:26,584
You're about ready
to fall outta that saddle!

349
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:28,592
Why don't we
rest up for a little?

350
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,594
I'm not that tired!

351
00:27:30,662 --> 00:27:33,187
Four or five hours ain't
gonna make any difference!

352
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:37,599
We've been chasin' him
since-- since
I can't remember!

353
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:40,194
That's right!
We've never been
this close before!

354
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:50,943
It might just be
that Young Bull's man
won't show up!

355
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:52,950
Might be!

356
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:56,112
You'll be stuck
with those guns!
Yeah!

357
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:11,168
After that meal,
I'm down to $80!

358
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:14,433
That's still enough
to play poker with
if you fellas want cards!

359
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:16,633
I lost one place
that way!

360
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:19,142
Since then I've reformed!

361
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:22,305
Well, I'm not much
at poker myself!

362
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:26,408
Still, if it's only
for a dollar or two--

363
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:31,513
Who knows? You might win
another 20 and have the price
of one gun! That the idea?

364
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,684
Three guns,
if your Indian friend
doesn't show!

365
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:42,433
Well, cut!

366
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:54,238
First jack deals,
anything opens, right?

367
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:59,515
Do you mind?
No, not at all!

368
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:01,449
Your deal!

369
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:29,813
Drink?

370
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:36,320
Would it do any good
for me to suggest that
we bed down for a while?

371
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:39,846
Nope!
That's what I thought!

372
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,753
When do we sleep?
As soon as we get to Riker's,
we'll sleep then!

373
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:47,992
Could be Dutch
didn't go to Riker's!

374
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:51,900
Wyatt only said if he was Dutch,
he'd go to Riker's, providin'
he was goin' to Tascosa,

375
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,838
which is only what somebody
said they heard Dutch say
where he was going to!

376
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:57,841
I think you better spit!

377
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:59,843
Huh?
Spit!

378
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,845
[ Spits ]

379
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:05,212
Just wanted to get your tongue
straightened around!
You know what I mean!

380
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:08,218
That's the reason
we're goin' to Riker's!
Come on!

381
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:13,185
Call!
Three kings!

382
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:15,192
[ Chuckles ]

383
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,594
I've heard of beginner's luck,
but I didn't know
it could be this good!

384
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:24,192
That clean you out?
Yeah!

385
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:27,670
At least we ate!
I'm about
to give mine back!

386
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:32,403
I could act like an Injun trader
and lower the price,
but I won't!

387
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:37,972
Offer still goes--
300 in gold for your Winchester,
whatever you pick!
No deal!

388
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,246
I'm a very patient man,
but you're talkin' like a fool!
Give him the gun!

389
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,312
- I said no deal!
- Be smart! It's a long, hungry
ride to Tascosa without money!

390
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,449
Again, I don't wanna sound
like an Injun trader,

391
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:50,586
but with all that smoke in
the hills and you with no guns--

392
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:54,098
Why don't you shut up?
The man's right!
Give him the gun!

393
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:59,036
You bought a gun!

394
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:10,476
Now all I need is a beaver hat
and I'll be dressed for Easter!

395
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:13,848
I'll be happy to find
one of these things
that works!

396
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,752
No wonder the Indians
try to shoot around trees!

397
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:18,755
Your deal!

398
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:21,155
Aren't you ever satisfied?

399
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:23,160
Not till I get
my gun back!

400
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:27,890
Deal!
Want me to pick out one
for you, Dutch?

401
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:31,696
Find one that won't
crack open in my face!

402
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,704
You got any Winchesters?

403
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:35,706
Ah, there's nothin' here
but a bunch of junk!

404
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:44,640
I won't need a rifle!
Just get me a six-gun!

405
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:51,617
It's gonna cost you
300 to draw cards!

406
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,250
Well, we weren't playin'
for that kind of money!

407
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:56,487
Playin' table stakes,
aren't we?

408
00:31:56,561 --> 00:32:00,088
Three hundred to draw cards!

409
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:03,498
Well, I may be foolish,
but I feel lucky!

410
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:10,740
How many?

411
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:12,743
I'll play these!

412
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:14,745
Now I don't feel so lucky!

413
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,951
Your bet!
Give me your guns!

414
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,393
Oh, no!
Table stakes!

415
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:37,901
Aces full on eights!
Just missed being
a dead man's hand!

416
00:32:37,969 --> 00:32:40,096
Not enough!
Four threes!

417
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:45,102
Drop it!

418
00:32:51,016 --> 00:32:53,541
You hadn't ought
to done that, Dutch!

419
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:56,644
You know I run a decent place!

420
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,746
One on the house
before you leave!

421
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:02,554
- Who said I was leaving?
- You're leavin'!

422
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:16,903
Don't forget your shells!

423
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:18,909
You may need 'em!

424
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:38,495
Open 'em up!

425
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:45,231
Young Bull, sorry to see you
all wearing war paint!

426
00:33:45,303 --> 00:33:47,533
What's the matter?
Trouble between the tribes?

427
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,835
We will look at the guns!

428
00:33:57,882 --> 00:34:01,716
They are old, worn out!

429
00:34:01,786 --> 00:34:04,118
They are not the guns
of which we spoke!

430
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:06,123
I'll admit
they're not Winchesters,

431
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:09,524
but everyone's a repeater,
and they'll all shoot true!

432
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:12,461
You lie!

433
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,623
If you were a white man,
I wouldn't take that!

434
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,964
But you're an Injun, so--
Yes, I am an Indian!

435
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:21,164
So it is wise
to listen in silence
while you wait to cheat me!

436
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,003
All white men are thieves!

437
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,509
In peace,
they steal our land!

438
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,876
In war,
they kill our women!

439
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:31,177
And you are a white man!

440
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:34,850
If you want my gold,

441
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:38,685
bring me the guns
with which Crazy Horse
and the Sioux of the north!!!

442
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:41,851
made their war
at the Little Big Horn!

443
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:44,258
Then you know
about Custer, huh?

444
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:47,590
[ Horse Whinnies ]

445
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:59,235
This is gun I want!

446
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,837
There isn't enough money
in your whole tribe
to buy that gun!

447
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:05,007
This is gun I want!

448
00:35:22,634 --> 00:35:26,593
There's a thousand in gold
and my gun!

449
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:35,879
You missed him!
If I did, he's deaf!

450

That's the trouble
with these old Henrys!
Takes 'em too long to kill!

451
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,889
Let's go down and get a gun
