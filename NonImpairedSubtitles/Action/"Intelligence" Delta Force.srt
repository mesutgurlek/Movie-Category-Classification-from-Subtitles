assassinated in Bolivia
in the past month.

9
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,908
The situation down there
has been a mess

10
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,541
since President Carrizales
took over.

11
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,176
So you think
that President Carrizales

12
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,946
is taking out his enemies
to ensure his re-election?

13
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,180
It appears that way.

14
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,548
But many countries
are about to have

15

a renewed interest in Bolivia,
including the U.S.

The leader who controls Bolivia
will have the power

And we're hoping that leader
will be Javier León.

22

He's a moderate,

This is a series of photos

outside of LA Paz

00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,214
just moments after the vicente
assassination in the brothel.

00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,215
I know it's hard
to make him out here.

60
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,050
We don't have
a positive I.D. yet,

but we believe that
it's the same man seen here.

Same hat, same jacket.

And this was taken a little
while after the second killing.

If he committed

He's a hero, and now our

Gabriel possesses
a rare genetic mutation

that allowed us to implant
a microchip in his brain.

We connected his mind directly
to the information grid.

It's something the chip does
that nobody expected.

So, how does this work?

164
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,791
I'll bring you
to a secure safe house,

165
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,192
and you'll remain with me there

166
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,928
until the undersecretary and his
team have arrived in country.

167
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,531
Agent Jameson will then take you
to the location of the meeting.

168
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,266
And where will that be?

169
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,234
It's better
if we don't tell you that yet.

170
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:34,171
At this point,
any information is need-to-know.

171
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,306
You don't trust me,
señor Vaughn?

172
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,208
Respectfully, sir,
we don't know your team.

173
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,311
This is my wife's brother,
nestor.

174
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:44,814
He's the primary reason
we're still alive.

175
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:49,686
You played two seasons as
a midfielder for Banda Roja.

176
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:52,355
- You follow LA Paz football?
- A little bit.

177
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:54,858
- Gabriel.
- Mucho gusto.

178
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,695
And what will you be doing,
Agent Vaughn,

179
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:01,865
while Señor Jameson is
keeping us so safe?

180
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,566
I'm gonna find the man
who wants you dead.

181
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,836
No matter how I feel about
the men who have been killed,

182
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:10,039
assassination is the lowest form
of political protest.

183
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,875
When you find those
who are responsible

184
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:16,546
for the murder of my opponents,
please bring them to justice.

185
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,081
We'll do our best, sir.

186
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:24,921
The package is safe
and on its way to the kitchen.

187
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:27,023
<i>And you're certain nobody</i>
<i>was following you?</i>

188
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,525
As certain as I can be,
given we didn't set up the meet.

189
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,361
Is your guy Cogan reliable?

190
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,129
Of course.

191
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:36,566
<i>He's also our only covert asset</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

192
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,502
<i>If anyone would have the intel on
Norris, it would be Agent Cogan.</i>

193
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,370
Well, we're about to meet him.

194
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,439
Nice digs.

195
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,808
When you guys say “clandestine”"
you really mean it.

196
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,878
<i>Talk to you crazy kids later.</i>

197
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,881
I don't appreciate his manner.

198
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:55,084
You'll get used to it.
Sort of.

199
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:06,595
You sightseeing?

200
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:10,399
It's a secret service tick.

201
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,902
I don't like going into places
where the only exit I know of

202
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:14,570
is the door we're walking in.

203
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,206
Relax. Uncle Sam pays the rent.
It's all wired.

204
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,208
There's a security camera
above that door.

205
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,844
I'm looking back at us
right now. Say “cheese”"

206
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:25,047
let's go.

207
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,456
Something's wrong.
Get behind me.

208
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,891
<i>You</i> get behind me.

209
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:37,526
Riley.
Gabriel.

210
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:40,662
Together, then.
One, two...

211
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:43,365
Three.

212
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,401
- Is that Cogan?
- It's him.

213
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:52,107
Norris!

214
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:55,410
Norris!

215
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:59,915
Norris is in the back
of the house.

216
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,516
[High-pitched whirring]
Gabriel!

217
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,684
You tripped something.

218
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,720
[Rapid beeping] Run!

00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,799
Are you okay?

222
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,735
Ugh. I think so.

223
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:22,137
Are you?

224
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:24,639
[Both groan]

225
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:27,843
That was close.

226

[Sighs]

227
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:36,184
He's gone.

228
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,522
We lost him.

229
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:46,704
[Breathing heavily]

230
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:48,573
[Dog barking in distance]

231
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:50,541
So, what's our theory on this?

232
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,844
Norris found out
the CIA was tracking him,

233
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:53,945
so he killed Cogan.

234
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:55,546
And booby-traps the apartment
to take out

235
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,048
any other spook
who shows up there.

236
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,017
Now that he's seen me,
it just got personal.

237
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,219
And for you, is it personal?

238
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:02,920
No.

239
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:06,224
He's just a guy we have to
bring down, nothing more.

240
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:07,992
Who are you calling?

241
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:10,628
C-doc. We have to tell them
Norris killed Cogan.

242
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,963
I have a better idea.

243
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,832
Let's call Norris.

244
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,767
How do you plan on doing that?

245
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,002
He's got a cellphone on him.

246
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:19,437
I caught the digits
right before the room blew.

247
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:20,605
Can you use it to track him?

248
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:23,007
He's too smart
to use a next-gen phone.

249
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,175
What do you mean?

250
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:26,510
The older ones don't have GPS...
harder to track.

251
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:28,613
We'd have to triangulate
off three towers.

252
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,314
And we're in Bolivia.
We're lucky we have one.

253
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:32,416

So you're just gonna call him?

254

Why not?

you running to, Johnny?

So what's your game, brah?
Who are you working for?

263
00:13:56,876 --> 00:14:00,210
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

264
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,313
We need to meet.
I want to talk.

265
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:05,883
No, we don't need to talk.
You need to step off.

00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:07,551
Or what, Johnny?

267
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:10,320

Like what?

324
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:03,892
Straight to the books, no matter
how awful the situation.

325
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:06,128
And what is so awful?

326
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,332
That we have to be in a place
like this, hiding like cowards.

327
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:14,369
When Cleopatra was at war
with her brother

328
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:16,004
for the throne of Alexandria,

329
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:19,107
there was one prize
that she needed first.

330
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,076
Caesar.

331
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:23,412
If she could seduce Caesar...

332
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:26,148
Mm... She'd have a
titan for an ally.

333
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,085
And are you prepared to lift
your dress for America?

334
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:31,687
Jameson:
Okay, your men are outside.

335
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,822
Nestor will remain
in the house with us.

336

What do you have there?

337
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,593
It's a blueprint. There's
a control room downstairs.

338
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:48,904
The Bolivians officially
ejected the U.S. in '84.

339
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:50,338
The CIA needed to protect

340
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,440
their people who were still
in the country,

341
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,209
so they built
these safe houses.

342
00:17:58,014 --> 00:18:01,449
[Chuckles]
Technology's a little outdated.

343
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,952
It should still work.

344
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:08,089
Now we have eyes.

345
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:11,059
What about communication?

346
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:14,729
Well, there's no cell tower
in the area.

347
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:16,598
Fortunately,
we brought our own.

348
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,099
A mobile satellite terminal.

349
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:19,467
With this puppy,
we'll be able to remain

350
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,970
in direct communication
with our team at all times.

351
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:23,972
Okay, you two should
get some rest.

352
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:25,907
The undersecretary will be here
in the morning.

353
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:27,775
Here?
It's the perfect location.

354
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:30,879
It's rural, secluded, and
it's completely off the grid.

355
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,348
Sounds like the making
of a ghost story.

[Chuckles]

Riley: Do you think Cogan
had anything on his computer

358
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:39,821
that will help us find Norris?

359

If he did, we'll never know it.
This thing's too far gone.

I can't get anything off it.

361
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:47,428
You said that you and Norris
were once best friends.

362
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,896
What happened?

363

[Sighs]

364

Fallujah.

Fubar clusterbang
if I ever saw one.

366

We shouldn't have survived it,
but we did.

367
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:03,244
After that,
our backs were glued together.

368

No.

It reveals them.

371
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:15,022
Killing a human being
for the first time

372
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:17,124
makes a normal person
sick to the stomach.

373
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:18,993
For others, it's an appetizer.

374
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:20,928
It makes them hungry for more.

375
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,497
And that's Norris.

376
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:26,967
By the time I left
my last tour,

377
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:29,737
he wasn't the same guy I knew.

378
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,038
I'd lost him.

379
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,309
There's just one thing
I can't wrap my head around.

380
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:36,510
What's that?

381
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:38,279
Why didn't he kill us?

What are you talking about?

383
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:41,515
He set a trap for us
at the apartment.

384
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:42,716
Almost blew our heads off.

385
00:19:42,718 --> 00:19:45,219
That trip laser wasn't meant
for us specifically.

386
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:47,688
Norris got what he needed,

set a trap for whoever else
came in.

388

It just happened to be us.

389
00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:53,027
But when he saw your face,

390
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,562
he could have headed us off
and taken us out, but he didn't.

What are you thinking?

You just said Norris
got what he needed from Cogan.

You could never see, Javi.
