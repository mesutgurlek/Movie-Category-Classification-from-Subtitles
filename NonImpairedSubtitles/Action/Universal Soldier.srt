1
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,745
A soldier does not speak...

2
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:02,624
...until spoken to by a superior officer.

3
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:06,857
A soldier shows no mercy.

4
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,858
Mercy is weakness.

5
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:11,898
Weakness is death.

6
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,462
The Forces are his family.

7
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,504
He is most happy...

8
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:29,538
...when following orders.

9
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:31,902
A soldier lives to kill.

10
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:44,456
A soldier needs no friend or family.

11
00:02:44,986 --> 00:02:46,419
War is his friend.

12
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:48,742
The Forces are his family.

13
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:05,418
Sir, Colonel Mekum has
his new batch unpacked.

14
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:07,776
l think he wants to show them off.

15
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:23,901
Well....

16
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:28,497
-They're pretty.
-What's so hot about them?

17
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,736
They're very much improved, Captain.

18
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,175
Colonel Mekum from HQ.
He's their commanding officer.

19
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:35,096
Sir.

20
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,579
'"lmproved.'" How?

21
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:42,584
ln every way possible.

22
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:45,820
You see, your old ones,
they're selected at birth.

23
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:48,545
With my new ones,
we're talking recombination.

24
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:52,222
They're practically manufactured,
using DNA profiles...

25
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:54,337
...and some manipulation.

26
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:57,503
More endurance, quicker responses...

27
00:07:57,586 --> 00:07:58,814
...better hand-eye...

28
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,817
...improved technical training.

29
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,897
lt's a whole different standard.

30
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:06,457
My daddy was in maintenance...

31
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:08,464
...and he had a saying:

32
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:10,742
'"lf it ain't broke, don't fix it.'"

33
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:12,940
'"Maintenance.'"

34
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,300
l'm afraid l don't get your point.

35
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:18,945
The veterans you see...

36
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:22,655
...standing before you here
have been through all kinds of heavy shit.

37
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:24,543
They've always got the job done.

38
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:28,221
Your new soldiers, these hotshots,
how much action have they seen?

39
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:30,304
And are they battle-tested?

40
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:35,064
How about a few tests,
just to get you on board?

41
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:37,424
Make you a believer.

42
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:55,861
Ninety-nine percent. That's...

43
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:57,580
...very good.

44
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:06,098
Seen enough, Captain?

45
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:08,898
What about endurance?

46
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,504
Caine 607, forward.

47
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:45,021
Sir!

48
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,302
Fifteen miles, 607, on the run.

49
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,104
You've got 60 minutes.

50
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:51,056
Go.

51
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:01,824
My man left exactly...

52
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,784
...20 minutes after yours.

53
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:05,545
Make a note of that.

54
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:58,742
Age is a factor. But the real factor
is the training program.

55
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,703
Especially the psychological.

56
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:03,540
The mind controls the body, after all.

57
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:07,544
And we're doing such wonderful things
with the mind.

58
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:16,182
Sir!

59
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,865
At ease, Soldier.

60
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:22,256
What is the price of all that speed?

61
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:24,064
ls your soldier tired?

62
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:26,375
'"Tired?'"

63
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:28,942
Todd ran the pace
he's been taught to run...

64
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:30,857
...and he's still strong.

65
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:35,263
Send him up the chain, Rube.

66
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,378
Soldier! Up the chain!

67
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:38,741
Sir!

68
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,542
607, on the double, up the chain.

69
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,456
Sir!

70
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:18,418
What about spirit?

71
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,784
l believe you mean AQ, Captain.
Aggressive qualities.

72
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,776
Much higher.

73
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,015
Much better.

74
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,905
What if they fought?

75
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,019
You mean up there?

76
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:30,460
Go ahead, Rube.

77
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,624
Tell Todd to take him.

78
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:33,582
No.

79
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:37,421
'"No?'"

80
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:40,055
Not fair.

81
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,781
No contest.

82
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:44,136
Send two more of your old ones up.

83
00:12:47,106 --> 00:12:49,222
Romero, Goines, up the chain!

84
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:17,780
Get him, men!

85
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,545
Get down here.

86
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:05,420
Get down here!

87
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:09,096
Get your ass down here on the double!

88
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:11,495
Come on, double up! Down, down!

89
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:14,455
Sir!

90
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:17,660
Look at you.

91
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:22,661
Do you know how much it cost
to breed you, you big moron?

92
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:24,660
To train you?

93
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:26,501
To feed you?

94
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,138
What good is this man now?

95
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:36,937
He's got no depth perception!

96
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:41,942
All he can do is walk, point,
and take the first hit!

97
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:49,940
-What about the bodies?
-Waste disposal.

98
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:56,776
Fall in.

99
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:57,821
Sir!

100
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,384
Todd was our best man.

101
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:12,822
You still don't get it, do you?

102
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:18,381
Your men...

103
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:20,585
...are obsolete.

104
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,975
You'll write this up as a training accident...

105
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:33,820
...and you'll make sure these bodies
get dumped a long way from here.

106
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:36,545
We don't want any unnecessary questions.

107
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,139
Someone, please...

108
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:12,182
...let us know what's going on!

109
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,621
Hawkins!

110
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:15,499
Give us something! Anything!

111
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:17,065
Quiet, please!

112
00:22:17,906 --> 00:22:18,861
Quiet!

113
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:21,618
How many of them are there?

114
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:23,139
There is one man...

115
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:24,455
...unarmed.

116
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:27,864
How could there only be one?
How could he get here?

117
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:30,776
He was unconscious when we found him.

118
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:33,303
We couldn't ask him anything.

119
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:35,744
Hang on. Jimmy's back!

120
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:38,218
There's nothing out there.

121
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:40,218
l couldn't see nobody.

122
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:43,026
Couldn't see no vehicles, no ship, nothing.

123
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:45,496
Plus the wind's up again real strong.

124
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:48,023
Everybody, calm down.

125
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:52,696
We have an injured man among us.

126
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:55,103
We all want to do the decent thing.

127
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:57,177
The decent thing is to help him.

128
00:22:57,906 --> 00:23:00,864
Sandra, Mace's wife,
is looking after him now.

129
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:04,944
Now, l'd like a vote of support
from all of you.

130
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:10,023
You keep an eye on him, Mace.

131
00:23:10,426 --> 00:23:11,495
Watch him.

132
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:12,296
There are words on his shoulder.

133
00:24:13,346 --> 00:24:14,779
'"Tannhauser Gate...

134
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:17,104
'"...Argentine Sector...

135
00:24:17,346 --> 00:24:18,779
'"...Shanghai 2012.'"

136
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:24,580
Sandra, the Tannhauser Gate was a battle.

137
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:26,585
He's a soldier.

138
00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:44,414
Where's Nathan?

139
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:01,981
Tiger!

140
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:03,658
Nathan, there's another tiger.

141
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:05,384
Help, help, help!

142
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:25,542
We're sorry if we woke you.

143
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:27,657
Just playing with the boy.

144
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:31,575
Sergeant...

145
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:33,497
...l made something for you.

146
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:43,816
lt's to help you walk, you see?

147
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:45,739
lsn't it? Like this.

148
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,541
See?

149
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:16,855
Here you go.

150
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:35,342
l don't see how you cannot remember
how you got here, Sergeant.

151
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:40,140
You're not a deserter, are you, Sergeant?

152
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:50,900
No, sir.

153
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:53,699
Why aren't you with your unit?

154
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:55,742
Come on, Slade, let the man eat.

155
00:26:55,826 --> 00:26:57,942
lt's not an unreasonable question.

156
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,264
How about it, Sergeant?

157
00:27:07,746 --> 00:27:09,259
l was replaced.

158
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:12,421
'"Replaced?'"

159
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:18,418
By a better soldier, sir.

160
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:29,424
When we left Earth 12 years ago,
we never thought we'd end up here.

161
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:32,465
When we crashed, a lot of people died.

162
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:37,141
A few years later, when the dumpers
started coming and dropping stuff...

163
00:27:37,226 --> 00:27:40,855
...people tried to get their attention
with fires and explosions.

164
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:42,584
But it didn't work.

165
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:44,822
They must be unmanned or...

166
00:27:46,026 --> 00:27:47,937
...maybe they just don't care.

167
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:52,296
So, we had to forget about a better life
on the Trinity Moons.

168
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:54,144
One good thing though:

169
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:56,618
Nobody bothers us.

170
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:00,500
Who'd fight for a godforsaken place
like this?

171
00:28:15,306 --> 00:28:16,261
But...

172
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,096
...l guess you like the fighting.

173
00:28:20,626 --> 00:28:21,661
You must.

174
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:22,781
You're...

175
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:25,220
...a soldier.

176
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:33,823
The biannual security sweep.

177
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,301
We'll be patrolling the Arcadia system.

178
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:39,185
We're going to set up
unmanned monitoring stations here...

179
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:41,018
...here, here, here.

180
00:28:41,546 --> 00:28:44,106
Now, we send the new soldiers out
on patrol.

181
00:28:44,586 --> 00:28:47,578
Routine stuff as you say, Captain,
but good experience and...

182
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:50,578
...l'll have a chance to see them
in a non-training environment.

183
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:51,860
You're coming?

184
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:53,939
Yes, Captain.

185
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,134
l want to observe these men at close hand.

186
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:00,017
Well, what about opposition?

187
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:03,620
lt's all deserted.
We're just confirming that.

188
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:05,776
But say we do encounter activity.

189
00:29:06,106 --> 00:29:08,097
Miners, refugees of some sort?

190
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:09,665
Well, we won't.

191
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:13,218
lf so, they'll be officially classifiable
as hostiles.

192
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,145
Just by being there?

193
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:18,977
We don't want paperwork,
and we certainly don't want passengers.

194
00:29:19,786 --> 00:29:21,060
Understood?

195
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:49,458
You have to watch out for those.

196
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:52,185
They probably wouldn't kill someone
your size.

197
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:54,981
But someone smaller, like me...

198
00:29:56,906 --> 00:29:58,225
...or Nathan....

199
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:00,058
He was bitten once...

200
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:01,744
...and he almost died.

201
00:30:02,946 --> 00:30:04,777
He was sick for a long time.

202
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:07,137
That's why he can't speak.

203
00:30:08,626 --> 00:30:09,456
Here.

204
00:30:10,546 --> 00:30:11,695
You try one.

205
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:15,301
Here.

206
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:39,775
Everything we own, Sergeant,
everything in the entire village...

207
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:42,380
...we've had to salvage from out here.

208
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:46,980
-You're all set, Jimmy.
-Back in a minute.

209
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:53,500
Whatever looks useful,
if we can get a chain to it...

210
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:55,417
...we're going to go for it.

211
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:02,225
You hear that?

212
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:04,541
That means she's really close.

213
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:06,055
She's going to blow!

214
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:07,465
On my way!

215
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:10,214
Line up!

216
00:31:16,946 --> 00:31:18,174
Come on, Jimmy!

217
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:21,105
Jimmy, come on!

218
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,774
Come on!

219
00:31:30,826 --> 00:31:32,259
Hurry up! Let's go!

220
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:37,899
-Mace!
-Give me your hand!

221
00:31:37,986 --> 00:31:39,499
-Too strong!
-Stretch!

222
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:40,985
Reach, Jimmy!

223
00:31:43,826 --> 00:31:45,145
l can't reach!

224
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:48,301
Help!

225
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:50,461
Help!

226
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:53,861
Pull!

227
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:00,665
Mace! Help!

228
00:32:07,106 --> 00:32:08,061
Pull!

229
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:18,258
All right, we got him!

230
00:32:34,906 --> 00:32:37,340
You were almost bacon on that one.

231
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:55,535
Thank you.

232
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:21,899
They're dumpers.

233
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:24,857
They come every 20 or 30 days.

234
00:33:26,946 --> 00:33:29,016
Sergeant, the gun. Please.

235
00:33:37,506 --> 00:33:38,825
Thanks, partner!

236
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:46,135
Them no-goods would've let me
blow away.

237
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:01,985
Sergeant Todd...

238
00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:05,939
...what's it like?

239
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:09,382
What's it like being a soldier?

240
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:12,178
What do you think about?

241
00:36:15,546 --> 00:36:17,457
You must think about something.

242
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,422
What about feelings, then?

243
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:26,262
You must feel something.

244
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:45,021
Fear.

245
00:36:49,746 --> 00:36:50,781
'"Fear?'"

246
00:36:52,426 --> 00:36:54,178
Fear and discipline.

247
00:36:58,866 --> 00:36:59,821
Now?

248
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:01,335
Always.

249
00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:07,181
Oh, my God.

250
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:32,464
Merry Christmas!

251
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,378
Merry Christmas, Sergeant!

252
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:26,342
l was going to give this scarf to him
last night, but he disappeared.

253
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:28,018
lt's beautiful, Jimmy.

254
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:29,815
He'll love it.

255
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:33,023
Well, he saved my life out there.
l guess Mace told you.

256
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:36,382
You should give it to him yourself.

257
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:38,138
He's in the meeting room.

258
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:40,223
He's doing exercises.

259
00:40:08,546 --> 00:40:09,695
Children....

260
00:40:11,866 --> 00:40:14,300
You're supposed to be doing your lessons.

261
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:26,775
Scarf!

262
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:03,336
People are upset about him.

263
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:07,337
There's going to be a meeting.

264
00:42:08,106 --> 00:42:09,983
He's not fully recovered.

265
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:12,458
That's what scares people.

266
00:42:13,786 --> 00:42:15,538
He gets stronger every day.

267
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,582
Are you scared of him, Mace?

268
00:42:30,546 --> 00:42:31,501
Yes.

269
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,463
l've never been afraid of anyone before.
Not like this.

270
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:40,620
l feel he could break me in half
with no real effort and no real...

271
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:42,981
...feeling.

272
00:43:32,186 --> 00:43:34,859
He is most happy when following orders.

273
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:37,703
A soldier shows no mercy.

274
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,424
Mercy is weakness.

275
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:42,378
Weakness is death.

276
00:43:43,106 --> 00:43:45,256
A soldier needs no friend or family.

277
00:43:46,186 --> 00:43:47,699
War is his friend.

278
00:43:47,906 --> 00:43:49,624
The Forces are his family.

279
00:44:44,546 --> 00:44:46,935
What the hell do you think you're doing?

280
00:44:47,426 --> 00:44:49,144
You could have killed him.

281
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:01,658
No one here has any animosity
towards you, Sergeant.

282
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:03,697
None of us here is your enemy.

283
00:45:04,706 --> 00:45:06,742
Furthermore, we respect your qualities.

284
00:45:06,826 --> 00:45:09,101
We have no doubt that you are a very...

285
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:10,824
...very good soldier.

286
00:45:11,306 --> 00:45:12,864
But because of your training...

287
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:16,495
...we don't think you'll ever be able
to function in a group like this:

288
00:45:16,586 --> 00:45:18,304
A community of families...

289
00:45:18,386 --> 00:45:19,739
...of children...

290
00:45:20,226 --> 00:45:23,855
...where the ability to fight is not
the sole purpose of existence.

291
00:45:24,186 --> 00:45:26,302
You're different from us, Sergeant.

292
00:45:26,466 --> 00:45:28,218
We don't hate you for that.

293
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:31,306
But we have agreed
that to try to include you...

294
00:45:31,386 --> 00:45:34,583
...would pose an intolerable risk
to the community itself.

295
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:39,136
We'll give you any tools you need:

296
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:43,179
Some warm clothing,
some boots, a good knife.

297
00:45:52,906 --> 00:45:54,737
Sergeant, you're our friend.

298
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,740
lt's just....

299
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:13,580
lf you need us, you can ask us for help.

300
00:47:58,186 --> 00:48:00,984
Command, we are on course
for Arcadia 234.

301
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:06,017
-How will you find him?
-He'll have stayed close to the wire.

302
00:49:06,106 --> 00:49:07,937
What'll l tell the council?

303
00:49:08,466 --> 00:49:09,535
We all voted.

304
00:49:09,626 --> 00:49:10,979
We voted wrong.

305
00:49:57,226 --> 00:49:58,375
We were wrong.

306
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:03,059
We made a mistake.

307
00:50:09,346 --> 00:50:10,381
We're sorry.

308
00:50:36,546 --> 00:50:38,582
lt's some kind of landing party.

309
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:40,265
Hey! Over here!

310
00:50:54,786 --> 00:50:56,265
Stay with me, sir.

311
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:40,063
All units stand by
for Arcadia 234 security sweep.

312
00:51:41,546 --> 00:51:44,185
Any trespassers will be considered hostile.

313
00:52:11,706 --> 00:52:12,900
Wait! What's going on?

314
00:52:12,986 --> 00:52:15,739
Somebody's landing!
Jimmy Pig spotted a ship!

315
00:52:41,386 --> 00:52:43,217
Two hostiles at 12:00.

316
00:53:22,186 --> 00:53:23,665
Hostiles eliminated.

317
00:54:14,306 --> 00:54:15,534
lt's no good.

318
00:54:15,706 --> 00:54:17,378
l've lost too much blood.

319
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:19,821
Why?

320
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:25,059
Was it a mistake?

321
00:54:39,426 --> 00:54:40,745
Oh, God, no!

322
00:54:41,826 --> 00:54:43,145
Not Sandra.

323
00:54:43,586 --> 00:54:44,575
Please...

324
00:54:45,226 --> 00:54:46,420
...not Nathan.

325
00:54:47,226 --> 00:54:48,295
Please....

326
00:55:10,586 --> 00:55:11,541
People!

327
00:55:11,906 --> 00:55:13,259
They spotted people!

328
00:55:13,346 --> 00:55:14,825
Two civilians, unarmed.

329
00:55:14,906 --> 00:55:18,182
They killed both of them. They spotted
smoke from some sort of camp.

330
00:55:18,266 --> 00:55:19,779
Jesus Christ! A camp?

331
00:55:19,986 --> 00:55:20,896
Excellent.

332
00:55:20,986 --> 00:55:23,136
This'll be very good experience
for the men.

333
00:55:23,226 --> 00:55:24,500
Let's see how they do.

334
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:26,178
Civilians need to be protected.

335
00:55:26,266 --> 00:55:30,145
Whoever they are, they don't belong there.
Officially, they're hostiles.

336
00:55:39,066 --> 00:55:40,818
Three-man fire team only.

337
00:55:41,426 --> 00:55:42,825
Prepare to deploy.

338
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:47,335
Everybody!

339
00:55:47,506 --> 00:55:48,825
Calm down!

340
00:55:49,506 --> 00:55:50,734
Calm down.

341
00:55:51,746 --> 00:55:53,976
l'm going to go out and talk to them.

342
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:57,065
Those of you with weapons,
prepare to defend us.

343
00:56:15,786 --> 00:56:16,980
God, help us.

344
00:56:47,786 --> 00:56:49,777
Three-man fire team in position.

345
00:56:51,346 --> 00:56:52,859
Crawler to fire team.

346
00:56:53,506 --> 00:56:54,461
Engage.

347
00:56:57,786 --> 00:57:00,141
Report from Crawler 1 :
Everything under control.

348
00:57:00,226 --> 00:57:02,262
-ls there resistance?
-lneffectual.

349
00:57:02,346 --> 00:57:04,257
Three men are going in to clean them out.

350
00:57:04,346 --> 00:57:06,621
Caine's ordered the rest to hold back.

351
00:57:06,706 --> 00:57:08,822
Sounds reckless. Three against 50.

352
00:57:09,346 --> 00:57:11,985
l can tell these men
have no combat experience.

353
00:57:12,426 --> 00:57:14,303
The old ones, the veterans...

354
00:57:14,426 --> 00:57:17,384
...they would've called for support,
just in case.

355
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:18,899
Speaking of the old ones...

356
00:57:18,986 --> 00:57:22,615
...why don't we have Riley and his crew
put up the monitoring unit?

357
00:57:24,746 --> 00:57:26,065
Atten-hut!

358
00:57:29,466 --> 00:57:30,421
Sir.

359
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:32,621
Riley?

360
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:35,300
-Will we be issued weapons, sir?
-No, Riley.

361
00:57:35,386 --> 00:57:37,058
Only soldiers get weapons.

362
00:57:37,346 --> 00:57:38,495
Yes, sir!

363
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,226
You don't even have
to salute anymore, Riley.

364
00:58:16,266 --> 00:58:17,221
Now!

365
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,858
You need any help, partner?

366
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:05,381
Riley and team deploying monitor unit.

367
00:59:13,186 --> 00:59:14,335
Don't panic!

368
00:59:14,826 --> 00:59:16,737
Up the stairs. Come on.

369
00:59:17,106 --> 00:59:18,334
Will, take him.

370
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:27,422
Go, go!

371
00:59:27,506 --> 00:59:29,144
Get inside the bedroom!

372
01:00:32,826 --> 01:00:34,498
Come in, Unit 703.

373
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:37,063
Unit 703, do you copy?

374
01:00:44,666 --> 01:00:45,735
A growl?

375
01:00:46,946 --> 01:00:48,345
He heard a growl?

376
01:00:48,466 --> 01:00:49,376
Well...

377
01:00:49,506 --> 01:00:52,339
...he didn't say the word '"growl.'"
He said, '"a throat noise.'"

378
01:00:52,426 --> 01:00:56,419
But l asked him to imitate it,
and it sounded like a growl to me.

379
01:00:59,506 --> 01:01:02,976
We're obviously up against
a significant military presence here.

380
01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:06,901
Well, let's send in the rest of the men.

381
01:01:06,986 --> 01:01:08,214
Absolutely not.

382
01:01:09,626 --> 01:01:12,459
Those bastards are just waiting
for us in there.

383
01:01:13,266 --> 01:01:14,062
No.

384
01:01:14,266 --> 01:01:16,063
We don't fall for an ambush.

385
01:01:16,146 --> 01:01:17,215
Colonel...

386
01:01:17,626 --> 01:01:19,105
...my daddy always said:

387
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:21,746
'"When you want to insert a nail
into a piece of wood...

388
01:01:21,826 --> 01:01:24,101
'"...you don't do anything
fancy or glamorous.

389
01:01:24,186 --> 01:01:27,417
'"Just take the damn hammer
and hit the son of a bitch till it's in.'"

390
01:01:27,506 --> 01:01:30,498
What exactly does that crap mean
in English, Captain?

391
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:32,258
Withdraw your men.

392
01:01:32,706 --> 01:01:34,298
Load them up with heavy artillery.

393
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:38,777
At night, they'll go back and pound
that place with mortars, rockets, cannons...

394
01:01:39,106 --> 01:01:40,744
...everything we got...

395
01:01:41,066 --> 01:01:42,977
...from a safe distance.

396
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,745
lt ain't fancy...

397
01:01:44,986 --> 01:01:48,342
...but it will sure take care
of your hostile military force.

398
01:01:48,506 --> 01:01:50,462
All right, do it. Withdraw the men.

399
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:02,896
Push really hard, okay? Hard.

400
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:43,543
They killed him, didn't they?

401
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:14,064
How do you know they'll be back?

402
01:03:14,146 --> 01:03:16,137
Because they're soldiers, sir...

403
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:17,421
...like me.

404
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:21,663
-Why are they doing this?
-They're obeying orders, sir.

405
01:03:22,186 --> 01:03:23,505
lt's their duty.

406
01:03:24,866 --> 01:03:26,458
Do you know how many they'll be?

407
01:03:26,546 --> 01:03:27,979
Seventeen more, sir.

408
01:03:28,066 --> 01:03:30,341
You can't fight 17 on your own.

409
01:03:31,226 --> 01:03:33,740
You have to organize us.
We're not cowards.

410
01:03:35,386 --> 01:03:36,660
We'll do as you tell us.

411
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:38,304
-We'll fight.
-No.

412
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,015
Why not?

413
01:03:43,466 --> 01:03:45,696
Soldiers deserve soldiers, sir.

414
01:03:46,466 --> 01:03:47,865
But one soldier...

415
01:03:49,386 --> 01:03:50,865
...against 17?

416
01:03:52,426 --> 01:03:54,098
What are you going to do?

417
01:03:57,546 --> 01:03:59,537
l'm going to kill them all, sir.

418
01:04:11,066 --> 01:04:12,658
Crawlers 1 and 2...

419
01:04:12,866 --> 01:04:14,504
...proceed to settlement...

420
01:04:14,586 --> 01:04:16,417
...and commence bombardment.

421
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,025
Crawler 1, we are red.

422
01:04:41,106 --> 01:04:42,334
We are red.

423
01:04:42,946 --> 01:04:44,584
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1 :

424
01:04:44,906 --> 01:04:47,215
-Report.
-Crawler 2, we are two down.

425
01:04:47,306 --> 01:04:48,819
Responding to sniper activity.

426
01:04:48,906 --> 01:04:50,817
Crawlers 1 and 2, split up.

427
01:04:50,986 --> 01:04:53,341
Crawler 1, locate and neutralize the sniper.

428
01:04:53,426 --> 01:04:54,415
Caine 607...

429
01:04:54,506 --> 01:04:56,815
...proceed to the settlement
and commence bombardment.

430
01:04:56,906 --> 01:04:59,181
Roger, 1 . We're proceeding to target.

431
01:05:13,386 --> 01:05:15,502
Crawler 1, deploying ground forces.

432
01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:01,855
All units...

433
01:08:02,026 --> 01:08:03,095
...report.

434
01:08:03,786 --> 01:08:05,265
438, negative.

435
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,145
515, negative.

436
01:08:09,706 --> 01:08:11,185
523, negative.

437
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:20,736
Squad 1, to your 9:00!
Squad 2, stand by with covering fire!

438
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,544
Enemy sniper at 12:00!

439
01:08:40,626 --> 01:08:41,900
Sniper located!

440
01:09:18,026 --> 01:09:19,584
-Ambush!
-Retreat!

441
01:10:13,986 --> 01:10:17,501
l think we have to assume
that the missing men are down.

442
01:10:17,986 --> 01:10:20,898
Maybe you should've made them smart
instead of fast.

443
01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:31,143
Squad 1, do you copy?

444
01:10:31,706 --> 01:10:33,503
Squad 2, do you copy?

445
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:35,943
Squad 3, do you copy?

446
01:10:36,586 --> 01:10:39,054
607 to Command.
1.5 clicks from settlement.

447
01:10:39,426 --> 01:10:41,815
Will engage enemy in two minutes.

448
01:10:42,786 --> 01:10:44,139
Roger, 607.

449
01:10:48,986 --> 01:10:50,305
Crawler 1 to Command.

450
01:10:50,386 --> 01:10:53,139
We have lost radio contact
with all ground units.

451
01:10:53,306 --> 01:10:55,581
We are still searching for the sniper.

452
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:02,656
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1 . Come in, 1 .

453
01:13:02,906 --> 01:13:03,702
One.

454
01:13:03,906 --> 01:13:07,216
Two to one. Take your port to our 9:00
and commence firing.

455
01:13:07,546 --> 01:13:10,538
Affirmative, 2.
Port to 9:00 and commence firing.

456
01:13:27,746 --> 01:13:29,145
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1 .

457
01:13:29,226 --> 01:13:31,182
Again, proceed to Port 9:00.

458
01:13:31,826 --> 01:13:32,781
Affirmative.

459
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:34,424
Proceed to Port 9:00.

460
01:13:41,506 --> 01:13:42,905
Where's my father?

461
01:13:52,426 --> 01:13:53,620
Two to one.

462
01:13:54,186 --> 01:13:56,461
You're still on 12:00. Correct: 9:00.

463
01:13:57,146 --> 01:13:58,625
Affirmative, 2.

464
01:14:06,746 --> 01:14:07,815
Crawler 1!

465
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:10,580
You're on a collision course with me!

466
01:14:10,786 --> 01:14:12,014
Affirmative, 2.

467
01:14:52,986 --> 01:14:54,624
Crawler 1, do you copy?

468
01:14:55,426 --> 01:14:57,223
Crawler 2, do you copy?

469
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:59,703
Are any ofyou men out there?

470
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:02,543
Can any ofyou men hear me?

471
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:05,665
Your men...

472
01:15:06,066 --> 01:15:07,340
...are obsolete.

473
01:15:10,746 --> 01:15:13,214
-Try Number 1 .
-l tried Number 1 ! l can't get either!

474
01:15:13,306 --> 01:15:16,298
This is bad. We don't know
what we're up against. How many?

475
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:18,616
They couldn't get figures on enemy troops.

476
01:15:18,706 --> 01:15:21,345
We're sitting ducks.
There could be a few divisions out there.

477
01:15:21,426 --> 01:15:23,940
We don't even have the weapons
to arm the old soldiers.

478
01:15:24,026 --> 01:15:25,379
ls that a recrimination?

479
01:15:25,466 --> 01:15:27,696
Because if it is,
l will have you court-martialed.

480
01:15:27,786 --> 01:15:30,346
-No, sir.
-All right, don't panic. Don't panic.

481
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:32,144
l am not panicking!

482
01:16:15,986 --> 01:16:17,055
Captain...

483
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,215
...you must have some
of those new DX-57s on board.

484
01:16:20,306 --> 01:16:21,978
Planet killers, you mean.

485
01:16:22,186 --> 01:16:23,335
We carry 15.

486
01:16:23,506 --> 01:16:24,700
One's enough.

487
01:16:25,746 --> 01:16:28,499
We set it on a short fuse
and we get out of here.

488
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:30,585
Boom. We win.

489
01:16:42,066 --> 01:16:45,058
Brave. lt means that even
when you're scared...

490
01:16:45,506 --> 01:16:47,383
...you control your emotions.

491
01:16:47,586 --> 01:16:50,100
You make the fear be really small and tiny.

492
01:16:51,346 --> 01:16:52,301
Oh, no!

493
01:17:36,746 --> 01:17:38,145
We should go, sir.

494
01:17:57,986 --> 01:17:59,021
Take him.

495
01:18:04,466 --> 01:18:05,421
Go back.

496
01:18:12,226 --> 01:18:13,625
Go back! Go back!

497
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:46,505
Right horizontal.

498
01:22:47,226 --> 01:22:49,501
Roger. Right horizontal checks green.

499
01:22:49,866 --> 01:22:50,981
What are we waiting for?

500
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:52,135
Give us a go.

501
01:22:52,226 --> 01:22:54,581
We'll give Riley and his men

505
01:23:04,826 --> 01:23:07,181
Losing men in combat is one thing,
abandoning them--

506
01:23:07,266 --> 01:23:09,655
l'm not going to die
because of your pompous bullshit.

507

Let's launch this thing.

Come on! On the double! Let's go!

Close up the lower hatch.

513
01:23:47,186 --> 01:23:49,063
Punch up your port power cluster.

514
01:23:49,146 --> 01:23:50,101
What was that?

515
01:23:50,186 --> 01:23:51,380
What was what?

516
01:23:57,626 --> 01:23:58,695
Get off of me!

517
01:23:58,786 --> 01:24:02,904
Fucking morons! Get your hands off me!
Ten minutes to go, understand?

518
01:24:03,466 --> 01:24:05,297
You're killing yourselves!

519
01:24:05,826 --> 01:24:07,259
What are you doing?

520
01:24:17,706 --> 01:24:18,582
You?

521

No!

524

Don't leave us!

525
01:25:23,626 --> 01:25:25,218
We must get out of here!

526
01:25:25,306 --> 01:25:26,500
Colonel!

527
01:25:55,186 --> 01:25:57,905

We must stop it!

-Get out of the way!

There.

Aye-aye, sir.
