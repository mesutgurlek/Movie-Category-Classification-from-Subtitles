don't know. For now, let's hook and book.

What have I got?

§ Last night in cold blood
My young brother got shot

167
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,829
(Hodges) And there they are.
The Ville. Crips. Crip de Ville.

168
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,039
Stone fuckin' killers. They'll walk in your
house, blow you away, sit down to eat...

169
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,310
Then leave.

170
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,755
That's right. You get them off the street.

171
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,597
- Lady, we're trying.
- You need more help! (laughs)

172
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,952
- So, what's up, Rocky-o?
- Yo, yo, yo, put it here.

173
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,314
Get your hand outta my face, all right?

174
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,475
Oh.

175
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,556
Hodges, you back, huh?

176
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,593
- What's up, homes?
- Hey, turn the music down, man.

177
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,998
- Hey, fuck that! That ain't my job.
- You better watch your back, man.

178
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,953
Nice ride, man. I didn't make it.

179
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,471
- Why you sneakin' up on us like that?
- You wanna get back on the sidewalk?

180
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,436
- You're all buffed out. Been to the joint?
- Just County. Missed you for a while.

181
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,114
You out on good time? What's this?

182
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,998
Oh, this here's my Hopalong Cassidy rag.

183
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,793
- Get rid of it.
- (voices arguing)

184
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,710
- Find better friends. You're in violation.
- Hey, I live right there. I'm just passin' by.

185
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,629
- What's the matter with him?
- Who, Rocket?

186
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,276
- Don't he like it around here?
- Cuz is down for the hood, man.

187
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,836
Y'all got any dope today?

188
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,476
Not us. We just say no to drugs.

189
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,708
- You go get some. I'll be right back.
- All right, man. Get some for us.

190
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,998
Yeah, you bet.

191
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,317
Hey, later on, Hodges.
Take care of yourself, homeboy.

192
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,396
They ain't got nothin', cuz.

193
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,836
Hodges has a new partner.

194
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,515
Fuckin' Melindez, man. I cannot
believe I'm back out here. Man!

195
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,553
I worked CRASH for five years.
I did my time. Finally made it up to Juvie.

196

Home at night with the wife. Get to
help somebody every once in a while...

200
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,236
Freeze.

201
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,710
Stop, asshole!

202
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,711
Fuckhead!

203
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,918
Don't move.

204
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,873
That's what you get
for messin' with the police.

205
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,039
Hands behind your heads, interlock your
fingers, down on your knees. Let's go.

206
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,116
Cross your ankles. Don't move.

207

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,516
Go on!

212
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,236
Bring him out here, McGavin.

213
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,749
Homes, what d'you think I'm gonna
find when I look under that car, huh?

214
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,632
Huh?

215
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,191
You don't run from

Oh, man, you smell good, homes.
What is that? Eau de doo-dah-day?

217
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,916
I saw him toss it.

218
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,070
What the hell were you runnin' for?

219
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,471
Answer me, asshole.

220
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,476
Answer me.

221
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,190
What's your name?

222
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,440
- What's your name?
- Clarence Brown.

223
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,389
- Don't lie to me.
- Clarence Brown.

224
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,274
- How old are you?
- 18.

225

14.

227
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,231
What else do they call you?
What's your name on the street?

228
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,316
Give me another name.

229
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,870
- High Top.
- Why do they call you that?

230
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,198
You a second-storey man, High Top?
You go down on basketball players?

231
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,239
What do you hang out with this loser for?
Wanna be like him? You do, don't you?

232
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,918
No.

233
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,472
- What's your heart beatin' for?
- I'm scared, man.

234
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,075
I thought you were runnin' a marathon.

235
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,875
Got it.

236
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,355
Stand up. Let's see your tattoos.

237

- (boy) What?

239
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,679
- Recognise this?
- (Crip) Cancel Christmas. You're dead.

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,156
- You on parole or probation?
- No.

241
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,078
Well, I got you on my file now.

242
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,949
If I catch you here again, I'm gonna shove
this up your ass. How would that feel?

243
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,157
uncuff him.

244
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,236
uncuff him.

245
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,636
You heard me.

246
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,079
- I'm Hodges. Ask around who I am.
- Yeah.

247
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,031
- You owe me one, OK?
- Yeah.

248
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,116
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.

249
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,956
Say it.

250
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,750
- I owe you one.
- OK.

251
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,836
Get outta here.

252
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,110
This alley is hot.

253
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,196
It's no longer yours, it's mine.

254
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,357
If I catch you here again,
I'm gonna arrest you.

255
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,233
Be straight with me,
I'll be straight with you.

256
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,193
Now, all of you, get lost.
Let's go. Come on. Out!

257
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,038
- Come on, man. Let's go.
- Go on.

258
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,310
- We'll get him round the corner.
- Right on.

259
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,590
I'm down for that.

260
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,716
I'll drive.

261
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,429
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

262
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,028
I made a righteous collar
back there, partner.

263
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,073
If I do something, I expect you to back
me up and I hope you expect the same.

264
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,749
Oh. You don't even know the area, yet you
wanna drag him in for a pissy little rock...

265
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,997
...and spend the rest of the shift
doin' paperwork? Is that a plan?

266
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,350
- You wanna hear a plan? I got a plan.
- Yeah.

267
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,069
We get him for rock,
then for somethin' else,...

268
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,637
...and when he does something serious,
it's not a first fuckin' offence!

Shit.

271
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,359
OK, that's your plan. All right.
Now you wanna hear mine?

272
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,278
You're full of fuckin' adrenaline, man.
You know...

273
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,597
You're not chasin' around
Mickey Mouse crimes any more.

274
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,514
Now, the plan as I see it
is to get to know these guys,...

275
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,598
...so then when somethin' big
does come along...

276
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,232
You wanna listen or what?

277
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,073
What?

278
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,112
You wanna look at pussy
or learn about this job? Which is it?

279
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,475
You heard the one about the two bulls?

280
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,436
Not yet.

281
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,516
Not yet, huh?

282
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,479
These two bulls are sittin' on a knoll
overlookin' a herd of Guernseys,...

283
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,277
...and the baby bull says "Hey, Pop, let's
run down and fuck one of those cows."

284
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,960
But the papa bull says "No, Son."

285
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,756
"Let's walk down."

286
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,836
"Fuck 'em all."

287
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,833
(dispatcher) Unit 15,
what is your location?

288
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,878
- When d'you get outta jail?
- (chuckles) What?

289
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,075
I could put a word in with Parole.

290
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,116
- What's your name?
- Louisa.

291
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,558
Danny.

292
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,671
Hi, Danny.

293
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,678
So you get time off for good behaviour?

294
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,076
You ever go out with a cop?

295
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,556
You don't like cops, do you?

296
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,238
No.

297
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,557
- No what?
- No sale. Let's go.

298
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,159
Yeah, sure.

299
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,030
I will be back.

300
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,470
I really love... your coffee, Louisa.

301
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,311
Bye.

302
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,396
Bye.

303
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,914
- You're jealous.
- That's right.

304
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,237
But I got a wife at home
whom I love, and three kids.

305
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,911
- Yeah, well, that don't mean shit.
- That's why I'm jealous.

306
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,274
You don't wanna get laid, man.

307
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,836
It leads to kissin',
and pretty soon you gotta talk to 'em.

308

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,675
I don't know if you remember -
they threatened that lady DA last year.

310
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,670
- (McGavin)? Que pasó, homes?
- What's up?

311
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,712
- (McGavin) Nice ride.
- Hodges, what's happenin'?

312
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,558
Not much.

313
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,672
You still smokin' that PCP?
Make you stupid, man.

314
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,997
No, I don't fuck with juice. This is weed.

315
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,076
Peewees smoke that shit. I don't.

316
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,070
You seen any... gang members around?

317
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,029
Who, me? I ain't seen any gang members.

318
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,116
You seen any gang members?

319
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,515
Check these vatos.

320
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,389
(police dispatcher on radio)

321
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,478
- 21st Street on our list?
- Nah.

322
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,114
Poor fuckers are professional victims.

323
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,391
Get their ass kicked constantly.

324
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,476
Kind of a mixed gang.

325
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,351
You got Diamond Street there, the Ville,
and the projects on the west.

326
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,438
So they gotta fight their way in
and fight their way out.

327
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,597
- They're fucked, huh?
- They are fucked.

328
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,156
- (thud)
- Jesus!

329
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,990
What're you gonna do? Stand in the street
and wave your fist? Let's go. Come on!

330
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,436
(§ hip-hop music)

331
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,593
(laughter)

332
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,956
Hey, what you guys doin'?

333
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,553
Stay where you are.
Drop and you're dead, buddy.

334
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,996
(music stops)

335
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,831
OK. All right, let's line up.
Come on, let's go.

336
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,030
Come on. Right up here. Let's go.

337
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,116
Let's go. Come on.

338
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,436
All right.

339
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,549
What's the matter with you?
Put that fuckin' thing away!

340
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,997
Asshole.

341
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,588
Hey, get your hands outta your pockets.
Put your hands behind your neck.

342
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,392
Come on. And you.

343
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,718
Are you guys stupid or what? Throwin'
rocks at our car... This is my office.

344
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,991
What are you, crazy?

345
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,198
Get your hands up.
Gimme your fingers, man.

346
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,556
Spread your legs. Wider.

347
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,877
Spread your fuckin' legs, homes.

348
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,118
Who threw the rock?

349
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,232
Oh.

350
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,669
We can have it any way you want.
You wanna have an understanding?

351
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,360
Are we gonna have
some kind of rapport or what?

352
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,190
- What's that?
- Cigarettes.

353
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,272
- You have any fuckin' primos in there?
- Chale, homes.

354
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,356
OK, get out.

355
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,156
What do you wanna have?

356
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,958
- Hodges, still with that rapport shit, huh?
- Hey. How you doin'?

357
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,997
What's my little brother
doin' up in that tree?

358
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,074
- Thinks he's a monkey vato, eh?
- Stay up there.

359
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,156
You heard the man.

360
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,672
- Little brother?
- Sí, mon.

361
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,276
What's your name, little brother?

362
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,029
- Tell him your name, homes.
- Felipe.

363
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,517
- That's my partner, McGavin.
- What's your name, man?

364
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,676
- Huh?
- Larry.

365
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,552
Larry.

366
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,156
New partner.

367
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,236
OK, Larry. Get over there.

368
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,916
Larry Sylvester. Looney Tunes.

369
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,270
What's the matter
with the peewees, homes?

370
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,836
- What?
- They threw a rock at my brand-new car.

371
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,230
Who threw the rock?

372
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,036
Who threw it?!

373
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,192
- You're a stupid fuck, you know that?
- No future in it, homie.

374
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,670
- So you're back in the jungles, homes?
- This ain't the jungle. This is Disneyland.

375
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,596
So how we gonna teach them?

376
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,195
I don't know, Hodges. I don't know, man.

377
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,232
I don't know about this
younger generation, homes.

378
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,919
You come down, Felipe.
I'm gonna beat your ass.

379
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,239
Well, keep the homeboys in line, all right?

380
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,716
Yes, sir.

381
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,436
Have a good day.

382
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,428
All right, homes.

383
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,758
I didn't mean to jump on your case,
it's just you were blowin' my deal.

384
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,916
Our community have kids out there
who are dying over colours.

385
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,397
I mean, actually dying over red or blue.
And what we need is your help.

386
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,876
We need you to testify when
you see something going on out there.

387
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,549
We're outnumbered, we're outgunned,
we're tired. We need your help.

388
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,194
You mean the cops
don't have enough guns? Shit!

389
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,472
- You wanna know why they pull this shit?
- Cos there ain't no jobs out there!

390
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,275
Hell with 'em all!
Throw all the motherfuckers in jail, huh?

391
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,075
I know all about bein' outgunned,
all right? I mean, I was in Vietnam.

392
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,349
Yeah!

393
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,870
It ain't about what you got in your hand.
It's about what the people want.

394
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,629
That's what it is, man.
You're doggone right that's what it is.

395
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,673
- It's what the people want.
- Wait. Let the man talk, all right?

396
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,509
I used to run with a gang, all right?
Now I work with 'em.

397
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,710
I just wanna make a point here.

398
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,719
The reality on the streets is
the dope dealer has the Mercedes-Benz,...

399
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,436
...the money and the women. Now, these
kids have eyes. They see what's goin' on.

400
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,872
And that is their socialisation.
It's the values that they respect.

401
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,468
We don't educate 'em.
We don't give 'em jobs.

402
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,398
We know all that.
Why don't you do somethin' about it?

403
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,353
Look, what we need
is some damn protection.

404
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,393
- Then you've got to get involved.
- Why the fuck d'you think we're here?

405
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,239
We're fed up! We're sick of this shit!

406
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,828
The police are never gonna get anywhere.

407
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,396
Shakin' people down,
shinin' their lights in our eyes.

408
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,990
Treatin' all of us like criminals
cos of where we live!

409
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,874
- And right in front of our kids!
- D'you know where your kids are now?

410
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,034
Fuck you!

411
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,958

- You don't go botherin' me about my kid.

00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,274
...greet the congregation and
all the rest of you who have chosen...

...to grace our church on this special day.

434
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,709
What makes this day so special?
"What is so special?" you ask.

Another black boy bites the dust
to which thou art returned.

436
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,749
I knew this boy, this Robert Craig,...

437
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,189
...whose mama brought him up
as best she could.

438
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,392
- It wasn't lack of love that killed him.
- (choir) Amen!

439
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,988
It was the scourge of drugs and gangs.

440
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,076
(congregation) That's right.

441
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,310
And what makes this day so special is, we
have now declared war upon this plague!

442
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,395
Yeah!

443
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,036
Till we see that this scourge of
gang violence is driven from our streets!

444
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,350
We've been bullied too long
by these sawed-off gangsters.

445
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,278
These gangbangers,
as they call themselves.

446
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,796
And now it is time for decent folk,...

447
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,230
- ...for people of God, to start bangin' back.
- Amen!

00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,632
- Are we afraid of these hoodlums?
- (congregation) No.

00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,115
Get these cops. Fuck 'em up!

462
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,196
Air 18, respond to shots fired.

463
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,155
That fuckin' bitch can drive, man.

464
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,029
(helicopter pilot) Air 18.
Code six. Have three suspects...

465
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,111
Assholes. Fuck. Crips, Bloods...

466
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,950
Oh, shit!

467
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,636
(winded gasps)

468
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,395
My wife, uh...
says she wants to meet you.

469
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,590
She says, uh,...

470
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,075
- ...you can bring a date.
- Thanks.

471
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,194
- Jesus Christ!
- (Hodges chuckles)

472
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,029
So we had Linda, you know.
She's 18 now, right?

473
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,550
And then Bobby said
"Well, why don't we try for a boy?"

474
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,672
So I thought Tommie for sure
was gonna be our last one, but...

475
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,951
- (baby gurgles)
- ...these things happen!

476
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,710
Well, they better not.

477
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,876
Oh, no. You heard what he said?

478
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,039
Jumbo shrimp! There's a contradiction.

479
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,833
- $14.95 a pound.
- Bobby...!

480
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,871
Hey, he's my partner.

481
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,788
What's money to two highly paid
professionals of LA's best? Right?

482
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,672
- Right.
- Let me go help you.

483
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,429
- No, honey. Sit down.
- It's OK. I'll just come. Later, dear.

484
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,950
Prick. Bastard.

485
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,638
You dog.

486
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,117
You better treat her right,
or her Mexican mama's gonna chop it off.

487
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,913
- A fuckin' angel.
- I know.

488
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,759
Pretty fancy drivin'
the other day, McGavin.

489
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,074
I mean, we didn't
have to try and catch 'em.

490
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,634
Are you sayin' I wouldn't have?

491
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,957
Well, if I was you,
a year before pension,...

492
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,389
...a wife like that, a kid...

493
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,670
Three kids. That's bullshit.

494
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,040
D'you wanna get into this now?

495
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,356
I don't understand you. I really don't.

496
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,637
You wanna psychoanalyse me?

497
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,594
- Where'd you get your fuckin' hard-on?
- Ask me if I loved my mother.

498
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,712
I used to get jacked up
cos I thought I needed that edge.

499
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,075
Well, maybe you don't, maybe I do.
Maybe we're just different.

500
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,271
What I remember most from that time
is nothing but regrets.

501
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,279
Let me tell you something: you can't
prove anything out on the streets.

502
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,110
What you do is a job. You can try to be a
professional - that's the best you can do.

503
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,036
Now in 19 years I've learned one thing.

504
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,358
If you try to fight every jerk on the street,
you'll be one sad, sorry son of a bitch.

505
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,630
And you'll never last 20 years.

506
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,435
And God forbid if you ever get married
and take it out on your wife.

507
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,915
She will walk. She will fucking leave you.

508
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,870
So why make it worse all the time?

509
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,230
- Is that one thing?
- Yeah, one thing.

510
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,396
It's all one thing.

511
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,239
- The other day...
- This isn't to do with that.

512
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,193
- Shut up! uh, do I get to talk?
- Talk.

513
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,313
I'm sorry about the car.
I fuckin' wiped out. What can I say?

514
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,238
You want me to say
it's not gonna happen again?

515
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,468
I know what you're saying
and trying to do,...

516
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,230
...but I didn't volunteer for CRASH to play
games and be nice to these assholes.

517
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,878
Think you get respect? They laugh and
fuck somebody up. I can't deal with that.

518
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,152
If you don't think you can deal with me,
well, I understand that, too.

519
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,552
- Well?
- (Louisa) What?

520
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,116
- So tell me about him.
- Well, I will tell you later.

521
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,755
- Gimme the baby. Louisa?
- No, it's all right. I enjoy it.

522
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,155
How do you want me
to cook those shrimp?

523
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,635
Oh, butterfly 'em.

524
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,196
What's up?

525
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,637
Nothin'.

526
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,512
You OK?

527
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,392
Yeah.

Yeah, he thinks maybe you're smart
enough to walk away from this bullshit.

Fuck Hodges, man!

00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,069
- I'll registrate your ass.
- Take all you bluecoats to try.

615
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,637
- Let's go get some of this juicy booty.
- Juicy booty!

616
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,591
Come on, we ain't goin' in that.

617

meet 1-Mary-10...

618
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,310
How'd you get involved?

619
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,591
Shit. Sheriff's got
the best intelligence, man.

620
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,549
We the ones called you in.

00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,875
Yeah?

622
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,790
I noticed all those gangbang assholes
drivin' fire extinguishers off the docks.

623
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,160
I couldn't figure out why they was so
concerned about puttin' out a fuckin' fire.

624
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,034
So I'm checkin' out the fire extinguishers,
and it goes off in my hands.

625
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,397
They put the coke in the holes, you
know? So the evidence gets destroyed.

626
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,678
I nearly froze my fuckin' balls off.

641
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,916

Hey, now, Oso.

650
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,195
- Oso means "bear" in Spanish, huh, Oso?
- Sí, mon.

651
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,278
Well, ain't this a fuckin' bear, Oso?

652
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,556
You know what I want from you, man?

653
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,078
Five names.

654
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,235
You ain't shit. We'll fuck you.
Send you to county jail.

655
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,474
Or you give us five names,
stand back of court, and walk.

656
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,795
Is that understood?

657
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,516
We ain't talkin' no DA deal now.

658
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,833
I don't know anybody, officer.

659
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,192
Search warrant. Resistin' arrest. Want
more? You're messin' with a sheriff now.

660
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,595
If I talk?

661
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,359
Gun clean, you walk,
right here, right now.

662
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,318
Fuck it. Sheriff,
you got Chango, Mosca and Trian.

663
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,316
That's good. I know those assholes
as well as I know my own.

664
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,591
Now, who take it to the city?
For my friends here.

665
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,432
Who take the coke out the hose?
Who is Smokey the Bear?

666
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,637
A cat named Winky and High Top.

667
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,871
- High Top?
- I'm not lyin', man.

668
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,958
I don't owe them pinche myates

669
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,676
Let's go. Come on. You been a good bear.
You can go hibernate for a while.

670
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,955
- High Top.
- I fuckin' had the motherfucker.

671
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,119
Had what? What did we have?
A piece of rock. Big deal.

672
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,595
Did we know he was tied in here?

673
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,712
Oh, hey, what?
uncle Bob make a mistake?

674
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,110
- You wanna go and second-guess me?
- No, I wanna go and bust him.

675
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,954
So you gonna pull a fire extinguisher
out of his ass?

676
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,957
I'll plant one there if I have to,...

677
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,870
...then you can pull it out so you don't
have to dick around in the car all the time.

678
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,436
You wanna fuckin' die? Spit it out!

679
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,830
Spit it out!

680
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,389
Face the wall. Down on your knees.
On your knees!

681
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,557
Spit it out! Spit it out!
You're gonna fuckin' die.

682
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,713
- Spit it out!
- That's enough, McGavin. Enough!

683
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,958
My partner doesn't fuckin' care if you
die either. Fuckin' stand up. Stand up!

684
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,036
Keep your hands behind your head.

685
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,476
Get down!

686
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,868
(chokes)

687
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,232
Your homeboy is gonna fuckin' die, OK?
He's gonna start turnin' blue and dyin'.

688
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,477
If somebody gives a fuck,
they'll bring him to the hospital.

689
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,957
- Don't fuckin' dance on me, OK?
- Enough. McGavin! Enough, hotshot.

690
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,396
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

691
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:27,036
Hold on. What are you doin', Picasso?
Crossin' out the names of your friends?

692
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,709
Not gonna like that, are they?
Put your hands on your head.

693
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,875
You at war with these guys now?

694
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,870
Well, they're not gonna
like that one bit, my friend.

695
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,236
I'll tell you what.

696
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,876
Turn around, White Fence.

697
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,357
Why don't you graffiti on this mural?
Why don't you do that?

698
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,434
Cos they'll kill your fuckin' ass
and you know that, right, homes?

699
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,473
Now, if I were you, I'd get out
of this neighbourhood right away.

700
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,632
Hey.

701
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,636
This is a misdemeanour.

702
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,515
We could take you to jail for this.

703
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:10,191
But I got a plan. We can work somethin'
out. Ever heard of Earl Scheib, homes?

704
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,036
That's enough of that shit!

705
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,711
What should I have done?
Put masking tape on his ears?

706
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,716
Go on, get outta here.

707
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,956
Fuck you, Pac-Man!

708
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,833
- Here's your lemonade.
- Thank you, darlin'.

709
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,112
So, like I was sayin', everything's
goin' all right. You're doin' a good job.

710
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,074
You down for your crime,
so don't worry about nothin', man.

711
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,158
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Yes.

712
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,876
Pac-Man!

713
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,396
Stand up.

714
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,956
I said stand up!

715
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,836
Get your hands behind your head.

716
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,348
Where your friends goin', dealer man?

717
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,631
You're usin' ten-year-olds
to carry your dope now?

718
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,636
What's this? You a brain surgeon?

719
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,716
Dr Feelgood?

720
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,870
Look at this shit.

721
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,998
- Where'd you get this?
- My auntie.

722
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,796
Man, I'm just kickin' it here. I'm just
chillin' out. What Pac-Man on me for?

723
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,476
(beeping)

724
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,992
Keep your hands behind your head
and turn around.

725
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,071
Who do you call when that beeper goes
off? Who's the nice man who calls you?

726
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,874
Huh?

727
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,514
Who's your connection? High Top?

728
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,596
What are you lookin' at, huh?

729
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,236
(outraged shouts from bystanders)

730
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,113
Don't you ever gimme no hard looks, cuz!

00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,595
- Just for that you're goin' to jail, homes.
- Goin' to jail?!

733
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,672
Aagh!

But I ain't did nothin'.

00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:34,314
- Man, these handcuffs is too tight!
- Well, they're not built for comfort, pal.

737
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,752
- Listen, man, you ain't got nothin' on me!
- I got handcuffs on you.

738
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,235
Say, man, you ain't got to grab my hair!

739
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,269
Ah, shit! Man, you ain't got shit on me!

740
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,550

741
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,910
Soon I'll be out of this motherfucker, man!

742
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,237
All that old punk shit you doin',
that ain't nothin'!

743
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,479
That ain't shit!

744
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:06,355
Say, man, a fuckin' parole violation? I'll
be out of this motherfucker in six months.

745
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,552
- Shut up.
- These handcuffs are too tight.

746
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,513
Want me to do a little
tap dance on your head? Shut up.

747
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,517
This fuckin' guy...

748
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,038
- What's the matter?
- I'm too old for your shit.

749
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,188
- I'm not gonna argue with that.
- Oh, yeah?

750
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,073
You think you can handle me?
You think I'm over the hill?

751
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,357
You want a fuckin' piece of me?!
Right now, huh?

752
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,554
You think you got the market cornered?
You think I'm not fuckin' crazy? Try me.

753
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,511
Try me, you fuck.

754
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,190
What are you talkin' about?

755
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,311
That's what I thought.

756
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,032
Hey, Hodges.

757
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,594
uncle Bob.
I don't have any problem with you.

758
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,152
Oh, no? You got problems with
the whole fuckin' world, and I'm in it.

759
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,952
And I don't like it.

760
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,358
Why don't you just chill out a little bit
and figure out which side you're on?

761
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,835
I would if I could.

762
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,474
But you're just like them, Pac-Man.

763
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,840
Nothin' but a gangster.

764
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:28,829
Now, you've been to my house, that's
where I live. Any time. Any fuckin' time!

765
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,870
You better bring your lunch.

766
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,875
- Will you just come out to talk?
- No!

767
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,150
- Why?
- You OK?

768
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,956
Yeah, I'm fine.

769
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,717

- Nothing. Just... go away!

771

No kidding? Well, thank you.

773
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,955
Will you just tell me what I did?

774
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,991
They hate you, McGavin.

McGavin? Oh.

You see that badge?

777
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,878
I wear it. That's my job. That's what I do.

778
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,796
So what do you want?

779
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,912
The other day you caught this boy
and put paint all over his face.

780
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,515
Well, he's my cousin.

781
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,916
Oh, that's funny?

782
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,275
I didn't know you had such a big family.

783
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,311
I'm sorry. OK?

784
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,396
I'm sorry.

785
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,516
You know what he was doin'?

786
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,670
He was crossing out the names
of East LA gang members on the wall.

787
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,360
You know what that means
when they do that?

788
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,279
It means they're gonna kill someone.

789
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,632
So I'm sorry if I sprayed the kid's face.
Maybe I saved his life that way.

790
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,910
- But I swear...
- I don't care!

791

That's mean, Danny. You're sadistic.

792
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,676
I am not with you.

793
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,593
I am with them, Danny. I'm a homegirl.

Did they threaten you?

No.

It's you who threaten me, Danny.

798
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,156
You have a mean heart.

799
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,595
What's up? What can I do for you?

800
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,437
- Thanks for comin' by.
- I called you because Felipe's got...

801
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,518
Felipe got all fucked up on PCP, homes.

802
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,028
He got whacked on that juice.

803
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,630
But he's straight, homes.
He goes to school.

804
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,117
Now they got him on this gang file shit
and he ain't banging, homes.

Hodges, I'm telling you this. You gotta
get him off the computer file, homes.

807
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,992
Well, he's gonna have
to go to Juvie Hall anyway.

808
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,236
Might do him some good.
Scare him a little.

809
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,909
Ah, he's scared. He's scared
of what I'm gonna do, homes.

810
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:02,194
Listen, get him out of the gang file. You'll
fuck up his life sure as I live, homes.

811
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,510
I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him, OK?

812
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,715
Orale! I know the routine, homes.

813
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,478
I owe you one.

- What's that?
- Credit.

Hey, homes, I was gonna pay those.

Want me to raise your bail, man?

Driver, put both hands out the window.

918
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,676
Both hands!

919
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,158
Keep your right hand out the window.
Take your left hand,...

920
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,397
...cross it over your body
and take the keys out of the ignition.

921
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,510
I wanna see the keys in your hand.

922

(helicopter pilot) Air Two. I have
two units, code six, on the suspect.

923
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,198
Now, with one hand,
open the right-hand door.

924
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,116
I want it all the way open.

925
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,636
Same hand, open the other door.

926
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,753
Now get your hand back up.

927
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,031
(helicopter pilot) Air Two.
We have two suspects. Male, black.

928

Passenger,...

929
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:04,518
...slowly climb over the driver's side.
Exit with your hands in the air.

930
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,910
Put your hands in sight above your head.

931
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,756
Face forward.

932
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,830
Hey, RJ, these guys look pretty scary.
You feelin' like a hero? Cuff 'em up.

933
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,479
This is the van that ol' Rocket was driving
when he shot up Robert Craig.

934
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,558
- Read 'em their rights.
- What for?

935
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,193
(cop) All right, keep your head still.

936
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:43,154
OK, move 'em over. That's it.
What you got? Nice and easy now.

937
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,714
- See my flashlight?
- Tell me what you got.

938
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,389
- OK, what do we got here?
- Don't want no surprises.

939
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,592
Don't worry. They got no diseases.

940

(helicopter pilot) Air Two.
Code four. Suspects in custody.

941
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,194
How long have you known Rocket?

942
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,595
A year? Ten years?

943
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,479
- About one year, I guess.
- About one year, you guess.

944
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,750
Where does his lady live?

945

I don't know.

946

Hey, don't pull my fuckin' dick, stupid.

947
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,836
I don't. I don't know where she lives.

948
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,156
OK, look. Somebody
wants to kill Rocket, let's say.

949
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:32,149
And old fat Willie's gotta let him know, be
a hero to him. Now, how do you find him?

950
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,398
I don't know.

951

Oh, man, homes.

We can do this all fuckin' night.
What is Rocket's girlfriend's name?

953
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,599
I don't know his girlfriend's name.

954

Hey, look.

955

You're not talkin' to some fool now.

956

We're talkin' about your freedom.

957
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,873
You don't know her.
What's her girlfriend's name?

958
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,512
- What girlfriend?
- Any one. Pick one.

959
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,916
Don't tell me you don't know
the little bitches' names in the hood.

Big strong boy like you.

Huh?

962
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,475
What's the name of some of
Rocket's girlfriend's friends?

963
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,519
Annie.

I'll front you in front of the homeboys.

968

I'll go out there, give you $50,
say "Thanks for the information."

How did he get your van?

977

Hm?

978
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:23,397

Now, if you don't wanna get in trouble,...

...just tell me how Rocket got it.

980
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,110
I lent it to my brother.

981
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,231
And?

982
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,316
Rocket took it from him at a party.

983
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,877
He just took the van?

984
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,995
My brother was afraid.

985
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,760
He's more afraid of Rocket than of you?

We don't want you, man. We want him.

988
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,637
But they used your van in a drive-by,...

- What?

992

You know that foxy little chick that hangs
out with Cheryl Williams and Annie?

And a girlie magazine. Hurry up, man.

1070
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,599
Hey, come on, Frog.
Are you playin' or what?

1071
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,399
What about the woman, Officer Baines?
Was she in the line of fire?

1072
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,273
Not to my knowledge. She wasn't hit.

1073
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:31,591
Your knowledge of our shooting policy
is the question here, Officer Baines,...

1074
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,598
...because your judgment
is certainly suspect.

1075
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:37,951
You killed a man, mister -
for reachin' for his pants.

1076
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:43,232
Sir, I thought my life and the lives
of my fellow officers were in danger.

1077
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:48,115
- He appeared to be going for a weapon.
- I do understand that, Officer Baines.

1078
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,992
But what I can't figure out...

1079
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:53,669
...is why you didn't take more time
to find out who was really in that room.

1080
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,236
Sir, we thought the 187
murder suspect was in the room.

1081
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,510
That's why we were there.

1082

You thought wrong, Officer Baines.

1083

Man, this is crazy.

1084

They think he shot him.

1085

- It wasn't you, was it?
- No, sir.

1086

What difference does it make?
If they think he did, he did it.

1087

They're not gonna shoot a cop.

- I'd rather not say.
