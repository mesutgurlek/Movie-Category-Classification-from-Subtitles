1
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,261
Back! Get back!

2
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,605
Spray!

3
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:52,380
Get off!

4
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,042
Hurry!

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,052
Run!

6
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,191
Okay. Pull him up!

7
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,165
Pull him up!

8
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,727
Come on

9
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,201
Get this to the lab. And hurry!

10
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:59,809
"28 Nov. Thanksgiving 18:00 Augrabies,
South Africa"

11
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:31,902
Move!

12
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,837
Let's go

13
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,790
509, unpack, and help him

14
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,422
502, the computer,
and you check with the team

15
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,687
Yes, sir

16
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:04,593
"3 March 06:00 Kakamas, South Africa"

17
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,352
Get ready

18
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,151
Target is approaching!

19
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,992
Here. Get down there!

20
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,602
What's this stuff?

21
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,136
Can't Move!

22
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,549
Come on, move it!

23
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,292
Let's go

24
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,795
Keep moving!

25
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,797
Come on

26
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,356
OK. You get up here

27
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,941
Attention!

28
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,972
What's your name?

29
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,569
Don't know, sir!

30
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,614
Where are you from?

31
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,909
Don't know, sir!

32
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,245
Good. No names, no background

33
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,310
But highly disciplined

34
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,456
Mission is over, go have some fun

35
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,353
Thank you, sir

36
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:48,657
OK. Dispose your weapons,
dispose your equipment

37
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,129
523.

38
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,132
Yes

39
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,503
Go! Collect. Go!
To the main helicopter. Go!

40
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,832
Yes, sir

41
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,513
Go! Move it, go!

42
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,442
OK. Dismiss

43
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,224
Sorry, sir

44
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,039
Jackie Chan,
one of our best agents in Hong Kong

45
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,515
is also missing in the African action

46
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,553
The three men they hijacked
are the scientists responsible

47
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:46,422
for the comet research project recently
launched by the African state

48
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,854
Lights!

49
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,954
We have a serious situation on our hands

50
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,124
The operation was carried out
with clinical precision

51
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,599
using United States
Air Force helicopters

52
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,300
They seized the meteorite fragments
along with the three scientists

53
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,003
and untill now
their whereabouts are unknown

54
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,704
If they knew the transport schedule

55
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,770
someone must have leaked the information

56
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,183
How many C.I.A. Staff
knew about this project?

57
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,716
I know where you're heading with this,
Norman,

58
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,276
and I don't like it

59
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,879
How can you be so sure
it wasn't one of your own people?

60
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,925
Why the hell would my guys
break into a hangar

61
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,722
they already have access to
and steal their own aircraft?

62
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,492
Because it's a perfect cover
and no one would suspect them

63
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,997
And remember, General

64
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,300
The C.I.A. Pulled out of South Africa
over a year ago

65
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,395
Only the essential staff remain

66
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,599
Right now, our first concern

67
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,644
should be the retrieval
of the scientists and the fragments

68
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:42,440
Agreed. There could be
serious military ramifications

69
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,643
if the wrong people
get a hold of this formula

70
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,812
We've got to find out
who's behind this pulling the strings

71
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,880
Agent Morgan

72
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,753
Yes, sir

73
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,349
You used to head up
our South African operation

74
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,292
You know the terrain,
you know the locals

75
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,930
Take 3 agents
and hop the next flight over there

76
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,796
I want to see positive results. And fast

77
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,232
Consider it done, sir

78
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:03,996
Thank you, Terry

79
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,934
Bye

80
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:05,698
General Sharman

81
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:06,599
Hello, Norman

82
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,139
I hear you're retiring a few days

83
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,174
Yes, I am

84
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,869
Congratulations on your retirement,
General Sharman

85
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,275
Thank you

86
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,444
I bet you're going to miss being
in the middle of all the action

87
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,746
Norman, I'm going to take that
fat pension check of mine

88
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,185
and head for my favorite fishing hole

89
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,785
I want a Black Op assigned to this case

90
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,084
Are you saying
we can't trust our own people?

91
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,954
Better safe than sorry

92
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,924
Shall I select them from Washington or

93
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,124
from one of the outside branches?

94
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,027
Outside

95
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,160
Sir, Mr. White is here

96
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,430
Thank you. Send him in

97
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,994
And tell them to report to me directly

98
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,300
Yes, sir

99
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,341
"Your plan worked, mission completed"

100
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,318
What's wrong with him?

101
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,291
I don't know

102
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,758
Do you think he can still walk?

103
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,325
How is he?

104
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,971
He's just woken up

105
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,769
My friend! You gave us quite a scare

106
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:29,839
We're happy you've woken up.
Welcome to our land

107
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,297
Where am I? How did I get here?

108
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,830
These men found you in the mountains

109
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,969
Now, I want to know,
where do you come from

110
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,103
and how did you get here?

111
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,540
I don't know your language.

112
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,543
Does anybody speak English?

113
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:11,989
I am the chief. Me. The chief

114
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,195
And who are you? What is your name?

115
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,693
Who am I?

116
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,405
Who am I?

117
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,738
His name is "Who Am l"

118
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,570
Who am I?

119
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:41,846
Your name is "Who Am l"?

120
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,085
Who am I?

121
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,575
Who Am I

122
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,745
Who is he?

123
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,255
Hello

124
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,228
Hey! Looks like you're getting better,
my man

125
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,854
I knew he would

126
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,475
What are you doing on this search, sir?

127
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,637
Langley must be serious about
finding these guys

128
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,546
They're traitors.
They've stolen a discovery

129
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,551
which could keep our nation on top,

130
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,353
in the 21st century

131
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,484
Yes, sir

132
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,123
Baba. Sit down

133
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,521
Sun...

134
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,191
Moon...

135
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:06,395
Sun's up, down, moon's up. One day

136
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,734
One day

137
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,931
Up. Down

138
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,473
One day

139
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,510
How many days walk

140
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,244
from here over the mountain?

141
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:34,788
One day, one day...

142
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,335
One day. Stuck here forever!

143
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:06,194
Baba, it's a lion! Baby!

144
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,934
Few more here!

145
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,266
Put it down! Run!

146
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,467
Lion baby!

147
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,102
Put it down!

148
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,167
Put it down?

149
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,872
Put it down!

150
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:48,569
Baba, do something! Where are you, Baba?

151
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,499
Baba, do something! Make them go away!

152
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,669
Go! Go!

153
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,974
Hey! Go!

154
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,566
Baba

155
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:30,010
Who Am I,
we have seen a miracle over the mountain

156
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:35,310
There was iron that had been burnt

157
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:40,154
We buried 8 bodies
wearing same clothes like yours

158
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,285
You mean come with you? Go?

159
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,330
Yes. Let's go!

160
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,864
Go!

161
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,606
Look at that!

162
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,776
Yvirorich, Russian

163
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,213
Jakol, Isreal

164
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,215
Hans, German

165
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,080
Thailand

166
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,449
Tachi, Japan

167
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,552
Korea

168
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:54,385
Who Am I, come quickly! Come!

169
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,322
I'm sorry. I don't know.
What are you saying?

170
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,213
See! There it is.
The fire I told you about

171
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,955
A light!

172
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:07,916
I can go! I can go! Yes! I can go!

173
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,553
The ancestors are with you!

174
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:17,432
The lion won't attack you!
The snake will never strike you!

175
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,465
God makes you strong!

176
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,106
The ancestors have heard!
They will protect you!

177
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,649
Now go forth as a man!

178
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,185
Fear nothing!

179
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,030
Good fortune be with you!

180
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,829
This bracelet will bring you luck

181
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,603
Remember!
The strong will become stronger

182
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,714
Thank you

183
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,580
Go in peace

184
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,079
Goodbye

185
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,426
When we found you,

186
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,435
you were wearing the same clothes.
Am I right?

187
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,733
Yes. We wear the same clothes

188
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,945
Eleven done one too many

189
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:00,585
Baba. Never play with
dead people's belongings

190
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,463
I know this is bad luck for your culture

191
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,831
I'll go on alone. Thank you

192
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,836
Go well!

193
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,067
Baba

194
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,272
Can I borrow your compass?

195
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,273
Can I take it?

196
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,411
I bring back, I promise

197
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,951
I promise

198
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,748
Please come back soon

199
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,221
I will miss you

200
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,457
Thank you

201
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,461
Be careful

202
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,623
Take care, my friend

203
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,257
You will succeed!

204
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:13,060
Somebody! Help us!

205
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,528
Hey! Look!

206
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,867
Don't you see us?

207
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,933
Help! Come back!

208
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,982
Somebody! Help!

209
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,275
We're over here!

210
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,017
Come back!

211
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,618
Are you okay?

212
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,517
We're over here! Help!

213
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:45,652
Look! Somebody! Help us!

214
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,478
Oh, my god!

215
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,989
Get away from him!

216
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,327
Stop eating my brother, you animal!

217
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,366
Leave us alone!

218
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,839
Leave us alone!

219
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,273
Don't move!

220
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,539
Don't move! You know this?

221
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,049
This is a gun!

222
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,551
You know, I can bang bang you!

223
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,214
You know, I can shoot you!

224
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,922
I can bang bang you, you know?

225
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,964
I know karate! Karate!

226
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,474
Medicine!

227
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:28,999
It's medicine!

228
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,300
My brother!

229
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,304
Your brother?

230
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,723
You're helping my brother!

231
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,620
You understand English?

232
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,323
Say something

233
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:07,496
Those medicine make my mouth numb

234
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,199
You speak French?

235
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,538
I understand a little, do you?

236
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,144
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't understand your language

237
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:24,678
But, is my brother okay?
Is he all right?

238
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,569
Amazing!

239
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,243
You navigate, and work the G.P.S., OK?

240
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:23,658
You want to drive?
But do you know how to drive?

241
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,430
I think I better, you know

242
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,075
Nine o'clock. Turn this way!

243
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,412
Okay. Just go straight ahead

244
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,753
Aiji, how are you feeling?

245
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,785
Feeling better. I.V. Is helping

246
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,846
Good!

247
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,833
Please help us! We need a doctor!

248
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:28,318
Look! Here's the driver!
Back a little bit! Back!

249
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,385
He's very lucky

250
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,559
The natural herbs on his leg
neutralized the poison

251
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,665
and that coconut I. V... The only people
that use it are elite military units

252
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,128
Who applied it?

253
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,429
Here

254
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,162
That's him over there

255
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,900
Amazing. Very talented native!

256
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,942
Say again? What? Give us a story!

257
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,340
Where are you going?

258
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,446
What?

259
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,083
What's he on about?

260
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,677
Oh, it's okay. Speak to him.
He understands English

261
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,172
So maybe you're an alien

262
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,070
and they erased your memory

263
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,471
So you'd be safe!

264
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,567
Just kidding!

265
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:30,008
Is your mouth still numb?
Try to say something

266
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:34,245
I think it's better.
The medicine works well

267
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,412
Oh, that's good! So what can I call you?

268
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,615
Everybody calls me "Who Am l"

269
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,284
Who Am I? Who's everybody?

270
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,151
It's a long story

271
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:47,053
OK. So what did the doctor say?

272
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:52,430
He says I should go to the city
to see an amnes...

273
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:53,697
Amnesia?

274
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,635
Specialist

275
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:55,763
Amnesia specialist?

276
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,066
And no more herbs

277
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:00,201
No more herbs?
That's probably a good idea

278
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,472
But thanks anyway

279
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:02,544
Thank you

280
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,905
Here

281
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,675
Come on. Hop in!

282
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:10,379
You drive this?

283
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:14,251
Yeah. This is my baby.
This time, I'm driving

284
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,057
Let's go

285
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,295
One of them is still alive

286
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,432
What?

287
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,332
He's all over the local paper

288
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,963
I want to know
if any of the others survived

289
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,437
I want every one of them liquidated

290
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:06,940
Including this one

291
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,605
That's a bit difficult with these,
C.I.A. Boys scout on my tail

292
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,416
That's not your problem, Morgan.
We've other people to take care of that

293
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,316
You just find him

294
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,206
Who Am I?

295
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,740
Yes

296
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:44,778
I'm Christine Spaak

297
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,749
I work for the South African Tribune

298
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,543
I saw you on T. V... What a great story!
That was!

299
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,919
I want to do an in-depth article on you

300
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,322
Huh?

301
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,417
I want to do an article on you

302
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,622
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm very busy right now.
Maybe some other day

303
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,257
But you don't understand! You're a hero!

304
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,824
Everybody wants to know who you are!

305
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,764
They do?

306
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:08,733
So do I

307
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,173
Who Am I

308
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,736
Excuse me

309
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,708
Wait! The article. Wait!

310
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,546
Wait, wait!

311
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,114
Hi, Who Am I

312
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:21,682
Don't you want to be a hero?

313
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,687
Everybody wants to know
what happened in the rally

314
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,188
Christine. Reporter

315
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,357
How's your brother?

316
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,825
Oh, he's going to be fine.
And the doctor's ready to see you

317
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,753
I think she wants to interview you

318
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,591
Oh? So you're the journalist? Yeah?

319
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,431
You know my name?
My name is Yuki. It's Y-U-K-I

320
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:44,438
Our x-rays show that you experienced
a severe blow in this area

321
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,136
It's very sensitive

322
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,541
It controls your reason,
logic and memory

323
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,275
That's why you're feeling confused

324
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,848
I'm not mixed up!

325
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,784
But if I am, is there any cure?

326
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:01,116
That's what they all want.
There is no immediate cure

327
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,849
Why don't you contact the police?

328
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:06,795
Perhaps Missing Persons will have some
information that will jog your memory

329
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,593
So where are you going now?

330
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,963
I'm going to the police station

331
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,058
The police station?

332
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,298
Yes

333
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,438
You can use my brother's hotel room
for the next few days

334
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,236
Hey, don't worry. You'll get better

335
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,780
Sooner than you think

336
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,707
- Okay
- I'll see you later then

337
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,218
Yeah. Bye

338
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,303
Did it work? Do you remember anything?

339
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,163
- No!
- No?

340
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,840
- Miss
- Yes?

341
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,535
What do you think you're doing?
This is a hospital!

342
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,842
I was just helping my patient. I'm sorry

343
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:01,849
Excuse me, sir

344
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,415
Agent Lee, C.I.A.

345
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:05,250
C.I.A.?

346
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,347
Our superior would like to
speak with you, just a moment

347
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,548
- Me?
- Right

348
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:14,064
Nothing serious. Just a quick chat.
Would you mind coming with us?

349
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:16,827
Thank you

350
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,363
Feel free to use this room.
It's all yours

351
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:36,818
Are you looking for me?

352
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,320
Yes, I am

353
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,290
Who are you? Have we met before?

354
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,757
Not that I recall

355
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,958
Morgan, C.I.A.

356
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,897
Chief operative, Southern Africa.
Pleased to meet you

357
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:56,573
Have I done something wrong?
Do you know about my past?

358
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,267
Yes, I do

359
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,872
I know you came out of the desert.
I know you lost your memory

360
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:03,909
And I believe you can help us

361
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,075
with a highly classified investigation

362
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,016
Me?

363
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,782
Are you sure you saw eight graves?

364
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,345
Yes, I'm sure

365
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,751
And a skeleton hanging from a tree?

366
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,361
Yes. From a parachute

367
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,389
Good. This information
could be highly valuable to us

368
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,831
Of course we'll have to verify it

369
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,166
And remember, this is top secret

370
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:32,640
Not a word to anyone. I mean, no one

371
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,241
Yes, of course

372
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:39,180
Mr. Morgan,
if you find out anything else about me

373
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,010
Plese let me know

374
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,280
Sure. I'll be in touch

375
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,821
Thank you

376
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:46,617
Very soon

377
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,821
523.

378
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,163
Mean anything to you?

379
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:00,798
What?

380
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:04,000
Good. Keep well

381
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,718
Close, but no cigar

382
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:17,617
It's not him?

383
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,952
No. Striking resemblance though

384
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:22,652
Mr. Morgan, wait

385
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,260
If I remember anything,
how can I contact you?

386
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,853
You have a business card?

387
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,691
I'm sorry. I don't

388
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:29,858
Here. You can use mine

389
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,093
No!

390
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:34,761
Use this. It's better

391
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,540
The C.I.A. Will put you
through immediately

392
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,769
It's a phone card.
You can use it anywhere in the world

393
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,602
Thank you

394
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,780
The poor guy can't remember a thing

395
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,113
So put him out of his misery

396
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,915
I'll make sure he doesn't enjoy
the African sun. Leave it to me

397
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,625
Bring it in, come on

398
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,560
Move it along!

399
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,197
Okay, you take it

400
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,896
I want this two brought inside

401
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,660
Come on, let's move it!

402
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,640
Hurry, hurry

403
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,085
Get to work, and running!

404
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:27,317
We're at a very
delicate stage of testing

405
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,052
The process should be gradual

406
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:29,953
I can't guarantee...

407
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,427
And I can't guarantee
your family's safety

408
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,123
Now get it started!

409
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,256
Work!

410
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,234
Activate the accelerator!

411
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:40,568
All set!

412
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,343
How can a tiny fragment
power up a whole city?

413
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:52,971
You don't understand
the power of this fragment!

414
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,947
You! Keep working!

415
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,918
Initiating bombardment!

416
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,079
Watch the leve!

417
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,745
225.

418
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,807
What's the flow rate?

419
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:23,210
Forty thousand joules and climbing!

420
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:25,914
It's working! It's working!

421
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,075
Yeah!

422
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,118
Yes!

423
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,221
Look out!

424
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,491
Go! Check it out!

425
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:42,623
What's going on?

426
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,598
The voltage is too high!

427
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,233
Abort! Abort!

428
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,109
Don't abort! Keep going!

429
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,735
We told you it was too soon!

430
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,177
The core's expanding!

431
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,075
Come on!

432
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,280
Move it!

433
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,594
Quick!

434
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,027
Let's go

435
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,664
Oh, my god!

436
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,691
Move it!

437
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,677
What was that?

438
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,641
I don't know. Let's take a look

439
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,901
Officer! Officer!

440
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,232
Officer!

441
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,738
Sergeant actually!

442
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,965
Sergeant. What about my case?

443
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,202
I've been waiting two hours

444
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,742
I'll get to you when I can.
Everybody is waiting!

445
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:12,109
The power station has just blown up,
and it's chaos everywhere!

446
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,877
What are you doing
standing in front of me?

447
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,419
If you're a missing person,
what are you doing here?

448
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,418
Have you seen a doctor yet?

449
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,045
I've already seen the doctor, officer

450
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,612
Sergeant!

451
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,287
Look, have a seat

452
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,594
As soon as we have sorted out
the problem with computers,

453
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,963
you'll be first on my list

454
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,023
Okay?

455
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:32,998
Pullen

456
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,367
What?

457
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,596
Yes, sir

458
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,479
More coffee?

459
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,813
No, thank you. Five is enough

460
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,374
I insist

461
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,346
Thank you

462
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,683
What am I waiting for?

463
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,493
Computers

464
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,404
Thanks for popping in.
I've been dying to meet you

465
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,652
What's going on?

466
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:28,882
Internal Security!

467
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,553
I've got a couple of questions,
I want to ask you

468
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,584
Go!

469
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,727
You two stay.
The rest of you come with me

470
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,333
We have the suspect. Keep guard

471
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,303
Get me the stuff

472
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,409
Have a seat

473
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,149
28th of March, you and your group

474
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:38,194
spent the night
in this deserted exhibition hall

475
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:44,165
On the 29th, your friends disappeared

476
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:49,899
On 30 March, 3 very important scientists
from my country were kidnapped

477
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:55,775
and their whereabouts is still a mystery
Where have you taken them?

478
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,242
Now listen, my friend

479
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,578
We witnessed five guys

480
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,845
and the scientists at the power station

481
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,649
Then, mysteriously it blew up

482
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:07,581
Now if you're not a terroist,

483
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,352
why the hell did you blow it up?

484
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:11,990
Who are you working for?

485
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:17,932
I don't know

486
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:24,435
Now on the day
that our scientists were kidnapped

487
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,908
We discovered extremely high-tech,

488
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,467
lethal weaponry

489
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,011
The likes of which
we've never been seen in Africa

490
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,511
Now only a first world country
has got the money

491
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,211
and the technology
to make something like that

492
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:41,549
So, I want to know from you, my friend,
who are you working for?

493
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,118
The Japanese, the Chinese,
or the Americans?

494
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,566
Or maybe somebody else?

495
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:54,661
And tell me, Eleven done one too many.
What does it mean?

496
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,133
I don't know who saved my life

497
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,674
But I thank you

498
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,733
Yvirorich, Russian

499
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,141
Jakol, Isreal

500
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,212
Hans, German

501
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,047
And you, what's your name?

502
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,744
I'm Paul, France

503
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,615
Muhamad, I'm Malaysian

504
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,245
Yubicha, Thai

505
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,789
Tachi, Japan

506
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,484
Dick Sing, Korea

507
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,118
My name is...

508
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,561
Gentlemen,
what a great combination we've got here

509
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,066
and I'm so sorry I've to do this

510
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,104
Don't move!

511
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:38,106
Sorry, soldiers,
we've got only 2 parachutes

512
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,205
What the hell is going on?

513
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:41,876
Have a nice flight, bye

514
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,563
What are you up to? Say it

515
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,466
Let me go

516
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,904
Here's the control. Come on!

517
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,355
Come on!

518
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:39,942
Come on!

519
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,735
Who are you?

520
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,280
You want to know who I am?

521
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:21,346
I want to know who I am

522
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:25,855
We found 54 different passports

523
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:29,558
That makes 6 for each of you. Why?

524
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:34,390
Where are your friends?
Who are your friends?

525
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,762
Well, there's no point
trying to cover for your friends

526
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:45,633
And don't you think you're in deep
trouble now, you ain't smelt nothing yet?

527
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:50,242
Talk to me. Now!

528
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,113
They're all dead

529
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,098
Quite a tough guy!

530
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,933
We know about your special training

531
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:16,130
But we've got special ways
to make tough guys like you crack

532
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,666
I'm waiting

533
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,711
I told you, it's no use

534
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:27,380
I lost all my memory

535
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:31,184
With this attitude, you're going to
lose more than just your memory

536
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:34,748
Get my drift? Book him.
On terrorism, espionage

537
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,655
and attempted murder

538
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:41,158
If any of his friends arrive,
I'd like to have a little chat with them

539
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,864
Let's go, smart ass!

540
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,747
What's happening in here?

541
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,760
You idiots! He was handcuffed! That way!

542
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,099
Go around the back!

543
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,672
How did he do this?

544
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,070
Don't just stand there.
We're losing him!

545
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,984
Thank you, I'll be back

546
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,353
He's on his way in
