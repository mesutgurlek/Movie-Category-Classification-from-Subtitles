1
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,836
Calling Cape Com. Cape Com?

2
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,712
This is Jupiter 16.

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,796
Can you give a go for fourth orbit?

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,672
Cape Com to Jupiter 16.

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,439
Can you confirm 02 pressure
is within limit?

6
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,189
Roger. It all looks good
in the environmental control system.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,834
OK. Everything looks good from here.

8
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,315
You have a go for fourth orbit.

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,396
Jupiter 16. Roger.

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,910
You're stowing all loose gear.
Ready for the EVA.

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,519
Jupiter 16, this is Cape Com.

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,437
Start your EVA when you're ready.

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,154
You have time in the other EVAs
for experiments.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,236
So don't stay out too long, Chris.

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,509
OK, flight.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,598
- Don't worry. We'll stick to plan.
- Roger.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,157
Cape Com to Jupiter 16. On my mark
it will be fourplus three seven.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,078
Four, three, two

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,350
one, mark.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,676
Cape Com, this is Chris.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,631
I'm out.

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,716
Everything looks OK.

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,114
Good.

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,515
The manoeuvring unit works this time.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,108
I used it to get out.
It makes things a lot easier.

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,198
Cape Com to Hawaii,
this is flight control, come in.

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,833
Hawaii, roger.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,589
Hawaii, we expect to start EVA
over your station on this pass.

29
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,199
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,517
An unidentified object is closing on you
fast from astern.

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,834
Can you see it?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,390
Hawaii, we have nothing here.
Hold while we check the space track.

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,678
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,429
Repeat, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,710
An unidentified object is on our scope.

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,833
We see nothing.

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,831
Can you give me a bearing?

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,473
Appears to be coming up fast,

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,431
from astern.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,516
Hey, now I see it.

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,076
It's another spacecraft!

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,517
Repeat, it's another spacecraft!

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,552
Does it looks like a close pass?

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,318
You're breaking up. Say again.

45
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,477
- Does it look like a close pass?
- Chris, what's happening?

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,558
It's coming right at us.
The front is opening up!

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,399
I repeat, the front is opening up!

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,116
- It's coming right at us.
- Chris, get back in, get back in!

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,549
Do you read me? You're breaking up.

50
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,035
- Repeat, you're breaking up.
- What's happening?

51
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,116
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
Hawaii to Jupiter 16. Are you receiving?

53
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,080
You're breaking up. Come in, please.
Jupiter 16!

54
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,156
You're breaking up...

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,870
My lead line! It's cu...

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,916
Hawaii to Jupiter 16, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,112
Are you receiving me?
Come in, please. Over.

58
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,389
Hello, Houston.

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,478
We've lost radio contact.
We've also lost him on the scope.

60
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,909
Unidentified object is still orbiting.

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,873
Alert all stations and track him closely.

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,749
It is ridiculous for the Soviet government
to deny responsibility.

63
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,997
The Soviet government denies
all knowledge of this affair.

64
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,634
The world knows
we are a peace-loving people.

65
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,716
I hereby give notice that in 20 days

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,400
the United States
will launch her next spaceship.

67
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,592
My government has instructed me
to inform you

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,156
that any interference with it
will be regarded as an act of war.

69
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,872
May I ask what motive

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,389
our Russian friends would have

71
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,034
for wishing to destroy
American spacecraft?

72
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,674
My government sees this
as a blatant attempt

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,112
to gain complete and absolute control
of space itself for military purposes.

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,196
We don't agree.

75
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,675
Her Majesty's Government
is not convinced

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,031
that this intruder missile
originated from Soviet Russia.

77
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,799
Our tracking station in Singapore

78
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,118
reported faint echoes of this craft
coming down in the Sea of Japan area.

79
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,073
Might I suggest
that this is where you should

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,350
concentrate your intelligence forces?

81
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,029
The prime minister asked me to assure
you this is what we propose to do.

82
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,948
As a matter of fact, our man in Hong Kong
is working on it now.

83
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,116
Why do Chinese girls taste different
from all other girls?

84
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,196
You think we better?

85
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,231
No, just different.

86
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,157
Like Peking duck is different from

87
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,475
Russian caviar, but I love 'em both.

88
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,636
Darling, I give you very best duck.

89
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,716
That would be lovely.

90
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,310
We've had some interesting times
together, Ling. I'll be sorry to go.

91
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,752
Take that door.

92
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,836
The bed!

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,830
- We're too late.
- At least he died on the job.

94
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,551
He'd have wanted it this way.

95
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,474
We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed

96
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,876
in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye,

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,877
at the last trump.

98
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,709
For the trumpet shall sound and
the dead shall be raised incorruptible,

99
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,796
and we shall all be changed.

100
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,435
We therefore commit his body to the deep
to be turned into corruption,

101
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,519
Iooking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead.

102
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,517
Present!

103
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,596
Fire!

104
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,316
Fire!

105
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,236
Fire!

106
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,716
- Carry on.
- Aye aye, sir.

107
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,958
Permission to come aboard?

108
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,230
- Permission granted.
- Thank you.

109
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,114
- Take this officer aft.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,036
Number One, take her up to 90ft.
Course zero four five.

111
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,116
Aye aye, sir.

112
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,034
- Hello, Penny.
- You'd better go right in.

113
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,674
You're late as usual,
even from your own funeral.

114
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,756
We corpses have no sense of timing.

115
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,352
In you go... sir.

116
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,436
Thank you... ma'am.

117
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,517
- Sit down, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

118
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,430
- No ill effects?
- None at all, sir.

119
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,429
Now you're dead, perhaps some of your
old friends will pay less attention to you.

120
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,950
Give you more elbow room.
You'll need it, too.

121
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,039
This is the big one, 007. That's why
I'm out here. You're fully briefed?

122
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,594
Yes, but there's one thing
I don't understand.

123
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,359
If our Singapore tracking
station is correct

124
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,631
about the rocket not landing
in Russia, where did it land?

125
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,274
We assume it's Japan.
All this is guesswork,

126
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,437
but the PM wants us to play it
with everything we've got.

127
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,711
- And the aerial reconnaissance?
- All photographed. Nothing.

128
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,400
Are the Japanese equipped
to launch such a rocket?

129
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,196
- We don't think so.
- Then who else is?

130
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,629
That's what you've got to
find out, and fast.

131
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,512
Before the real shooting starts.

132
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,269
This damn thing could blow up
into a full-scale war.

133
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,312
When you get to Tokyo,
go to that name and address.

134
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,590
Our man Henderson
will contact you there.

135
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,871
- Henderson.
- Captain here. Full ahead.

136
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,513
Right.

137
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,197
- That's all.
- Thank you, sir.

138
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,673
- 007.
- Sir?

139
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,439
We've only three weeks
to the next American launch.

140
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,959
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,709
My sources tell me the Russians
are planning one even earlier.

142
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,877
- So move fast, 007.
- Yes, sir.

143
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,710
By the way, how was the girl?

144
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,038
Which girl?

145
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,435
The Chinese one we fixed you up with.

146
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,835
Another five minutes, I'd have found out.

147
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,520
She'll never know what she missed.

148
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,718
Miss Moneypenny,
give 007 the password we've agreed

149
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,354
- with Japanese SIS.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,153
We tried to think of something
you wouldn't forget.

151
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,269
Yes?

152
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,519
I... Iove... you.

153
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,790
Repeat it, please,
to make sure you get it.

154
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,478
Don't worry, I get it.

155
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,272
Sayonara.

156
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,550
James... good luck.

157
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,309
Instant Japanese. You may need it.

158
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,110
You forget, I took a first
in oriental languages at Cambridge.

159
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,476
Stand by to load.

160
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,076
Lift to the launch!

161
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,478
Tube loaded.

162
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,510
Hubcap open.

163
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,109
Fire.

164
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,676
This is your ticket.

165
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,156
Thank you.

166
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,356
Dozo.

167
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,878
I love you.

168
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,078
I have a car nearby.

169
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,715
- Where do you suggest we go?
- I know a quiet hotel.

170
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,629
- And?
- Where your friend is waiting.

171
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,719
Mr Henderson.

172
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,155
Wasn't Mr Henderson
able to come himself?

173
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,874
- I suppose not.
- Why?

174
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,116
He didn't say.

175
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,154
I think it's about hotel-time.

176
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,870
How long have you
worked for Henderson?

177
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,039
Long enough to learn not to discuss
such matters with strangers.

178
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,029
- Mr Henderson's waiting for you.
- You're not coming in with me?

179
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,993
Mr Henderson would like
to see you alone.

180
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,236
Do come in.

181
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,116
Mr Henderson?

182
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,196
At your service.

183
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,871
I believe you wanted to
ask me some questions.

184
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,230
Yes. Excuse me.

185
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,708
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you got it right.

186
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,955
I lost that in Singapore in '42.

187
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,192
You must excuse
this rather odd mixture of styles,

188
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,039
but I refuse to go entirely Japanese.

189
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,118
Very fond of some of these old things.

190
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,113
- You've never been to Japan before?
- No, never.

191
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,038
I myself have lived here for...

192
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,716
28 years.

193
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,149
And I'm just beginning
to know my way about.

194
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,432
- Your most vital contact will be Tanaka.
- Tanaka?

195
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,120
He's head of the Japanese secret service.

196
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,755
And his identity is the most
closely guarded secret in Japan.

197
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,836
When can I see him?

198
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,758
- You can see Tiger tonight.
- Tiger?

199
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,316
His closest friends
are permitted to call him that.

200
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,908
- Do you have any leads of your own?
- Yes, I do.

201
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,679
That's stirred not shaken.
That was right?

202
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,358
Perfect.

203
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,436
Cheers.

204
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,956
Russian vodka. Well done.

205
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,436
Yes, I get it from the doorman
at the Russian embassy.

206
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,676
Amongst certain other things.

207
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,030
Now, look. I think London's theory

208
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,516
about the missile being fired
from this country is right.

209
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,074
I don't know how or where.

210
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,555
And don't ask me who's doing it either.

211
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,676
But I have a fairly shrewd idea
that a major foreign power is behind it all.

212
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,360
You mean, apart from Russia and Japan?

213
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,552
It's not Russia, old boy, I'm sure of that.

214
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,636
It's not Japan either.

215
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,878
Although a large Japanese
industrial concern is...

216
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,396
Good evening.

217
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,636
Cheers.

218
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,676
Siamese vodka?

219
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,116
There he is!

220
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,953
Freeze!

221
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,513
Get in, quick!

222
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,396
What the hell's the score?

223
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,560
What do you mean?
My job is to help you.

224
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,636
Like you helped Henderson?

225
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,830
I'm taking you to a place of safety.

226
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,111
No, this time I'm taking you.
I want some information now.

227
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,153
- I have no information to give you.
- We'll see about that. Slow down.

228
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,311
Welcome.

229
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,757
Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond.

230
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,710
It is a great pleasure to meet you at last.

231
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,635
And how do you like our country so far?

232
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,359
I am a trifle disappointed at the ease
with which I could pull you in.

233
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,995
The one thing my honourable mother
taught me long ago

234
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,793
was never to get into a car
with a strange girl.

235
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,799
But you, I'm afraid,
will get into anything with any girl!

236
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,350
You have a lot of energy
for a dead man, Mr Bond.

237
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,596
You are James Bond, aren't you?

238
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,630
I am so very pleased to meet you,
Bond-san. I really am.

239
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,636
Permit me to introduce myself.

240
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,957
My name is Tanaka. Please call me Tiger.

241
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,038
If you're Tanaka,
how do you feel about me?

242
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,270
I... Iove you.

243
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,994
I'm glad we got that out of the way.

244
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,078
I'd like you to examine these
as soon as possible.

245
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,156
They're from Osato's safe.

246
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,350
This is an order for naval stores.

247
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,029
500 kilos of butter, 50 containers of lox.

248
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,878
What is lox?

249
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,560
An American name for smoked salmon.

250
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,638
But it's also the technical name
for liquid oxygen.

251
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,716
Which makes rocket fuel.

252
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,796
- Very interesting.
- Yes.

253
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,672
We must go.

254
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,758
The journey out will be more dignified
than the journey in.

255
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,871
That wouldn't be difficult.

256
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,195
I'd like that negative enlarged.

257
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,276
OK.

258
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,432
My private train.

259
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,835
I never travel in the streets of Tokyo.

260
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,599
In my position, it would be most unwise.

261
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,072
Very convenient.

262
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,875
I imagine that your Mr M in London
has a similar arrangement.

263
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,956
M? Oh yes, but of course.

264
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,913
Then the girl in the white
sports car's one of us.

265
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,792
- Aki? Yes.
- Very competent.

266
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,558
- Domo arigato.
- Dozo.

267
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,309
Do you like Japanese sake,
or would you prefer vodka martini?

268
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,192
Oh, no. I like sake.

269
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,197
Especially when it's served
at the correct temperature.

270
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,311
98.4° Fahrenheit, like this is.

271
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,477
For a European,
you are exceptionally cultivated.

272
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,393
- We'll see the photograph you found.
- Good.

273
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,994
A ship and a strip of land.
It could be anywhere.

274
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,997
My men found a microdot on the paper.

275
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,076
Enlarge!

276
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,433
It says, 'Photograph taken by female
American tourist from coastal vessel.'

277
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,552
'The woman has been liquidated
as a routine precaution.'

278
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,070
- Can we see the photograph again?
- Of course.

279
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,431
They killed an innocent tourist
for taking this?

280
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,630
Can you make it bigger?

281
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,512
Ning-Po.

282
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,552
Check motor vessel Ning-Po. Full details.

283
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,513
All recent movements
and present whereabouts.

284
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,592
- What's that on the left?
- Focus on the left!

285
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,109
Ama. Diving girls.

286
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,196
Can you identify that coastline?

287
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,276
Given time, yes.

288
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,433
- Who is the head of Osato Chemicals?
- Mr Osato.

289
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,120
Can you arrange an appointment
with him tomorrow?

290
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,514
Of course.

291
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,108
But tonight, consider my house yours.

292
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,277
Including all of my possessions,
naturally.

293
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,152
My friend, now you take
your first civilised bath.

294
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,714
Really? Well, I like the plumbing.

295
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,515
Place yourself entirely in their hands,
my dear Bond-san.

296
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,791
Rule number one...
is never do anything for yourself

297
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,990
when someone else can do it for you.

298
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,554
- And number two?
- Rule number two:

299
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,349
in Japan, men always come first.
Women come second.

300
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,596
I might just retire to here.

301
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,354
Your English girls would never perform
this simple service.

302
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,755
I know one or two
who might get round to it.

303
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,269
Miss Moneypenny, perhaps?

304
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,834
We have our sources,
Bond-san, just like you.

305
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,634
Don't get the soap in my eye, will you?

306
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,631
I suppose you know what it is about you
that fascinates them.

307
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,231
It's the hair on your chest.
Japanese men have beautiful bare skin.

308
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,316
Japanese proverb say,

309
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,796
'Bird never make nest in bare tree.'

310
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,556
If Henderson's theory is right,

311
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,150
why would a foreign power
want to launch missiles from Japan?

312
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,716
Because if they were discovered,
they could deny responsibility.

313
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,877
Especially if some private organisation's
doing the work.

314
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,956
- Osato?
- Perhaps.

315
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,753
Mr Osato is one of
our greatest industrialists.

316
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,552
No, he's merely a front.

317
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,558
- Who is big enough?
- SPECTRE.

318
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,954
Could be.

319
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,799
Now, massage. Which girl do you select?

320
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,195
I'll settle for this little old lady here.

321
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,514
Good choice.

322
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,596
She's very sexyful.

323
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,554
The last time someone gave me
a massage was in Hong Kong.

324
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,669
But unfortunately...
we had to cut it short.

325
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,236
We were rudely interrupted
by a couple of gunmen.

326
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,594
So, we never got around to finishing it.

327
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,110
This time, you shall finish it.

328
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,593
Aki.

329
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,595
No one will disturb you tonight.

330
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,276
I think I will enjoy very much
serving under you.

331
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,593
- Mr Fisher?
- Yes.

332
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,154
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

333
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,556
Please come in, Mr Fisher.

334
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,353
- Mr Osato is expecting you.
- Thank you.

335
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,436
You are three and a half minutes early.

336
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,516
Please be seated.

337
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,435
- How do you do, Mr Fisher?
- How do you do?

338
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,518
Miss Grant, my confidential secretary.

339
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,596
- Hello.
- Hello.

340
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,508
- May we offer you some champagne?
- No, thank you, it's too early for me.

341
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,596
- You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.

342
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,473
I always take a glass in the morning.

343
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,955
- You should try it.
- It's bad for your liver.

344
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,039
- Nonsense, it adds a sparkle to the day.
- I'm sure it does.

345
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,872
A Dom Pérignon '59, Mr Fisher.

346
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,595
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- Well, if you insist.

347
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,678
- Please be seated, Mr Fisher.
- Thank you.

348
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,116
So, you are the new managing director

349
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,992
- of Empire Chemicals?
- Yes.

350
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,634
- What happened to Williamson?
- Williamson?

351
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,320
He died rather suddenly, poor chap.

352
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,271
Ah, so. From what?

353
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,356
He fell into a pulveriser at the works.

354
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,436
Ah, so.

355
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,516
How shocking.

356
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,750
- A very honourable death, all the same.
- Very.

357
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,030
He gained great face with the company.

358
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,550
I hope you are not taking
any risks yourself, Mr Fisher.

359
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,989
Me? I never take any risks.

360
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,873
You forgive me for saying so, but...

361
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,756
I think you are taking one now.

362
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,595
I am?

363
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,756
You should give up smoking.

364
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,871
Cigarettes are very bad for your chest.

365
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,594
Mr Osato believes in a healthy chest.

366
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,392
Really?

367
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,432
You must tell me what I can do for you.

368
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,109
We're interested in the bulk-buying
of fermentation chemicals.

369
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,198
Monosodium glutamate
and ascorbic acid.

370
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,756
- Would you like a manufacturing licence?
- Yes, very much.

371
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,839
I'll have my sales manager
get the quotations

372
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,633
and delivery dates for you
as soon as possible.

373
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,116
We'll contact you later today
at your hotel.

374
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,073
- Which hotel are you staying at?
- The Hilton.

375
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,478
Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

376
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,433
- A pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure to meet you, too.

377
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,274
- Goodbye, Miss Brandt.
- Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

378
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,236
Kill him.

379
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,508
Get down!

380
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,917
294 here. Tiger, immediate.

381
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,996
Come in, 294.

382
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,035
Zero-zero is with me. We are being
chased by gunmen, in black sedan.

383
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,151
I'm heading south for Highway Two.

384
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,271
Arrange usual reception, please.

385
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,915
- How's that for Japanese efficiency?
- Just a drop in the ocean.

386
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,918
- Zero-zero?
- Yes, Tiger.

387
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,190
Ning-Po is owned by Osato Chemicals.

388
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,074
- That fits. Go on.
- Vessel now loading in Kobe docks.

389
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,317
Sailing for Shanghai
at 5pm this afternoon.

390
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,596
Suggest you proceed Kobe immediately
to look her over.

391
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,234
- Can we make it?
- Yes, just.

392
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,510
Proceeding immediately, Kobe docks.

393
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,596
Tiger, contact M.

394
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,436
Tell him to send Little Nellie.

395
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,516
Repeat, Little Nellie.

396
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,835
Suggest she be accompanied
by her father.

397
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,916
Most urgent. Understood?

398
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,598
Understood.

399
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,313
Condensation: ice-cold. Liquid oxygen.

400
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,196
Get out of here. Contact Tanaka.

401
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,276
I'm not leaving you.

402
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,949
Tell him to keep that ship shadowed.

403
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,832
Go now.

404
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,036
Take him to Number 1 1 .

405
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,074
- Wake him up.
- Are you finished?

406
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,597
Where am l?

407
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,676
You're in my cabin on the Ning-Po.

408
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,395
Leave him to me now. Wait in there.
And shut the door.

409
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,678
I've got you now.

410
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,711
Enjoy yourself.

411
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,036
- Who are you working for?
- Empire Chemicals, you know that.

412
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,470
- Do all their people carry guns?
- When they're abroad, yes.

413
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,637
And why were you
snooping around the docks?

414
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,593
I like ships. And I used to be a sailor.

415
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,358
You are a liar.

416
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,038
- Do you know what this is?
- I'd rather not.

417
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,754
Plastic surgeons call it a dermatome.

418
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,671
They use it to slice off skin.

419
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,355
I hope you won't force me to use it.

420
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,791
Now, what's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

421
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,516
I have a confession to make.

422
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,312
What?

423
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,908
Actually, I'm a spy.

424
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,996
I know that.

425
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,311
I suppose you know that
industrial secrets are big business?

426
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,189
I've stolen Osato's new process
for making monosodium glutamate.

427
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,548
And...

428
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,750
Well, it's worth

429
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,871
$300,000.

430
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,789
So?

431
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,038
I'll split it with you if you'll get me
out of here and back to Tokyo.

432
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,196
That's a nice offer.

433
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,029
- How about it?
- I'm afraid not.

434
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,718
Why?

435
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,916
Osato would kill me.

436
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,758
We could fly to Europe tomorrow,
you and l.

437
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,150
The things I do for England.

438
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,513
Now, you are going to need some
very close... protection tonight in Tokyo

439
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,916
because... well, that's when
they'll try and get at you.

440
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,996
You'll need the best man we've got.

441
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,076
And who do you suggest?

442
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,954
Well,

443
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,229
me.

444
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,432
I'm afraid I have another appointment
tonight, Mr Fisher.

445
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,438
I'm awfully sorry to leave you...
but I have to get off.

446
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,629
Chasing girls will be the end of you,
Bond-san, I have told you before.

447
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,320
He didn't chase her.
He did it so I could get away.

448
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,556
He wouldn't touch that horrible girl.

449
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,591
- Would you?
- Heaven forbid.

450
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,438
Any progress?

451
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,358
Yes. We identified
the coastline in the photograph.

452
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,951
It is an island called Matsu, on the direct
route between Kobe and Shanghai.

453
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,230
We shadowed the Ning-Po in a helicopter.

454
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,430
- Did it stop at the island?
- I think so.

455
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,836
It was a very dark night.
Impossible to see her all the time.

456
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,679
But we know she stopped somewhere.
Look at these.

457
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,950
That one we took last night.

458
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,159
And that one, early this morning.

459
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,117
- Notice, please, the water line.
- You're right.

460
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,549
Fully laden here and empty here.

461
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,675
I want to take a fast look
at the island now.

462
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,156
- Has Little Nellie arrived yet?
- Yes, and her father.

463
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,032
Ah, welcome to Japan, Dad.
Is my little girl hot and ready?

464
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,948
Look, 007, I've had a long and tiring
journey, probably to no purpose.

465
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,435
I'm in no mood for your juvenile quips.

466
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,236
I have much curiosity, Bond-san.

467
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,078
What is Little Nellie?

468
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,670
She's a wonderful girl.
Very small, quite fast.

469
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,916
Can do anything. Just your type.

470
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,951
A toy helicopter?

471
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,516
No, it's certainly not a toy! You'll see.

472
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,393
We've made some improvements
since you used her last.

473
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,115
- I'll give you the drill.
- This is only for children. Don't use it!

474
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,231
Take my helicopter instead.

475
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,596
Right. Now pay attention.

476
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,280
- Two machine guns, fixed.
- Synchronised to what?

477
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,312
100 yards, using incendiaries
and high explosives.

478
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,351
Two rocket launchers,

479
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,994
- forward-firing on either side.
- Fine.

480
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,318
Now, these fire heat-seeking
air-to-air missiles. 60 a minute.

481
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,668
Good.

482
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,314
Flame guns. Two of 'em. Firing astern.

483
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,876
- What range?
- 80 yards. Two smoke ejectors next door.

484
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,715
Aerial mines. Now remember,

485
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,195
use them only
when directly above target.

486
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,517
- That's about the lot. You know the rest.
- Yes.

487
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,038
Cine camera.

488
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,357
- Tanaka, listen in on 410 megacycles.
- Good luck!

489
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,755
I'll contact you when I get over the island.

490
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,916
Be careful, Bond-san!

491
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,271
Hello, Base One.

492
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,756
I'm over the island and the fishing village.
Nothing to report.

493
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,677
We'll keep listening.

494
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,150
Hello, Base One.
There's nothing here but volcanoes.

495
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,158
Understood. Carry on.

496
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,476
- Hello, Base One.
- Listening.

497
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,556
Little Nellie got a hot reception.

498
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,955
Four big-shots made
improper advances,

499
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,878
but she defended her honour
with great success.

500
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,036
- Heading for home.
- Do not come home.

501
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,116
Russian space shot imminent.

502
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,118
Proceed vector4-6 degrees
and await instructions.

503
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,151
- Understood?
- Roger and out.

504
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,872
Clear the area. Clear the area.

505
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,596
Prepare for reception.

506
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,836
Prepare for reception.

507
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,279
Radar blackout is now complete.

508
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,198
Radar blackout is now complete.

509
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,634
Moscow radio's already saying we did it.

510
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,433
The president's called
a press conference for 2pm.

511
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,835
He'll deny emphatically we were involved.

512
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,916
- But can we prove it?
- Of course not.

513
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,110
No one will believe the Russians did it.

514
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,357
Now they'll use the excuse
to shoot down our next Jupiter.

515
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,758
Houston to Washington. We followed him
for one orbit, now he's offthe screen.

516
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,836
That means he's coming down.

517
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,748
- Yeah, but where?
- Some place in Russia. It has to be.

518
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,472
The British theory about Japan
is nonsense.

519
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,556
- Forget Japan.
- I agree.

520
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,911
We've re-photographed
every square inch.

521
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,233
Ventilator fans to full power.

522
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,316
Open all air ducts.

523
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,396
Area safe to enter.

524
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,476
All crews to stations.

525
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,716
All air ducts to normal.

526
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,436
Air ducts opened.

527
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,630
- Close crater.
- Closing crater.

528
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,556
Fire guards to station.

529
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,437
Ventilator fans to normal. Open shutters.

530
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,876
Reception complete.

531
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,275
Withdraw captive spaceship.

532
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,316
Guards to stations.

533
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,437
Remove the prisoners.

534
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,914
I shall be in my apartment.

535
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,070
I may send for you later.

536
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,395
I must congratulate you, gentlemen,
upon your superb equipment.

537
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,353
We congratulate you, sir,
upon the way you handle it.

538
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,631
Our clients are satisfied
with the progress so far?

539
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,070
- My government is quite satisfied.
- Good.

540
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,679
Hans!

541
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,636
You will see that my piranha fish
get very hungry.

542
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,308
They can strip a man to the bone
in 30 seconds.

543
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,756
I have decided to ask for
a little money in advance.

544
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,032
I want the sum of 100 million dollars,
in gold bullion,

545
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,674
deposited in our account in Buenos Aires.

546
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,189
Our agreement states
no money should be paid

547
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,710
until war has broken out
between Russia and the United States.

548
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,833
- This is extortion.
- Extortion is my business.

549
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,315
Go and think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy.

550
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,312
Osato and Number 1 1 , report now.

551
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,597
An unknown Englishman
was in your office the other day.

552
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,551
Correct, Number One.

553
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,513
- Do you know what gun this is?
- Walther PPK.

554
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,597
Only one person we know
uses this sort of gun.

555
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,790
James Bond.

556
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,352
- But Bond is dead.
- It was in all the newspapers.

557
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,754
Rubbish.

558
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,791
Bond is alive.

559
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,150
Unless you killed him, Mr Osato?

560
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,316
Don't tell me you let him go.

561
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,797
I gave Number 1 1
the strictest orders to eliminate him.

562
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,672
And did she?

563
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,836
She failed.

564
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,157
You should have killed him.
You had plenty of opportunity.

565
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,953
This organisation
does not tolerate failure.

566
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,878
- I know, but you see, l...
- Go!

567
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,354
Well?

568
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,035
Osato!

569
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,235
Kill Bond! Now!

570
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,269
Yes, Number One. Yes. Yes, yes.

571
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,440
- Hello.
- Bad news from outer space.

572
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:48,030
Yes, I heard it. Now the Russians
are accusing the Americans.

573
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,196
Next time it will be war.

574
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,118
- We'll have to get down to the volcanoes.
- I agree.

575
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,198
We'll also need
a company of first-rate men.

576
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,390
Do you have any commandos here?

577
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,476
I have much, much better.

578
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,269
Ninjas. Top-secret, Bond-san.

579
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,116
This is my ninja training school.

580
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,951
- Ninjas?
- The art of concealment and surprise.

581
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,835
This must develop
very fast reflex actions.

582
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,632
And spiritual strength.

583
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:29,158
Now, we will see some modern ninjas.

584
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,516
My plan is this.

585
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,596
I make a base on the Ama island.

586
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,075
100 of my ninjas will slide in unseen.

587
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,995
They will be workers and fishermen.

588
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,076
- What about me?
- Later.

589
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,510
But for the moment,
these will interest you. Rocket guns.

590
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,198
Very powerful.

591
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,754
See the holes in the back
for jet propulsion.

592
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,720
- It's a fine gun.
- All rocket guns.

593
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,396
This is our special baby rocket.

594
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:06,030
Very useful for people who smoke
too many cigarettes, like you.

595
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,798
- Accurate up to 30 yards.
- Very neat.

596
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,276
- It can save your life.
- You sound like a commercial.

597
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,031
- What's the plan for me?
- First, you become a Japanese.

598
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,390
Second, you train hard and quickly

599
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,829
to become a ninja like us.

600
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,750
And third, to give you extra-special cover,

601
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,836
you take a wife.

602
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,957
Regretfully impossible.

603
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,832
You must marry Ama girl.

604
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,951
One who is known on the island.

605
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,277
- Is she pretty?
- She has a face like a pig.

606
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,676
- To hell with that idea.
- But this is duty.

607
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,194
The girl I have chosen
is an agent of mine.

608
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,629
But first, you must become Japanese.

609
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,353
Eyepieces to Hera.

610
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,995
Why don't you just
dye the parts that show?

611
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,916
- Konbanwa.
- Konbanwa.

612
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,040
Tiger said, from now on,

613
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,958
you must do everything Japanese-style.

614
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,991
Everything?

615
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,076
Good for Tiger.

616
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,199
I'm...

617
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,790
I... I...

618
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,909
Aki!

619
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,996
I'm...

620
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,276
She's dead.

621
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,276
Poisoned.

622
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,830
Tiger, we must get to that island.

623
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,111
You're almost ready.
Just two more days' training.

624
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,671
- You killed him.
- Yeah, he tried to kill me.

625
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,996
This man is a stranger from outside.

626
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,030
It's lucky we're getting out of here.

627
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,835
Tomorrow you will be a poor Japanese
worker, with humble Japanese wife.

628
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,916
Yeah, with a face like a pig.

629
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,996
My men are already ashore.

630
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,076
All over the island.

631
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,795
We have four days left.
It is not much time.

632
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,716
This is my house.

633
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,634
My friend has made us some food.

634
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,596
Do you live here alone?

635
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,234
Yes. My parents are dead.

636
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,316
Sit down, please.

637
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,913
Oysters.

638
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,554
Is this the only room there is?

639
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,352
Yes.

640
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,436
That is your bed.

641
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,516
I shall sleep over there.

642
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,072
- We're supposed to be married.
- Think again, please.

643
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,156
You gave false name to priest.

644
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,352
But we must keep up appearances!
We're on our honeymoon.

645
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,869
No honeymoon. This is business.

646
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,430
I won't need these.

647
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,194
- Bond-san.
- What's wrong?

648
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,553
The Americans have changed
the launching date.

649
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,636
The countdown has already started.

650
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,718
The president has given
a last warning to the Russians.

651
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,354
- When does it go up?
- Tonight, midnight. Our time.

652
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:18,075
- Did your men search the island?
- Yes. There is nothing but volcanoes.

653
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,156
Everything is so normal around here.

654
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,475
- Nothing happens.
- One thing has happened.

655
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,592
Yesterday an Ama girl
rowed her boat into Ryuzaki.

656
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,234
- Ryuzaki?
- It is a big cave on the mainland.

657
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,669
And when her boat floated out again,

658
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,552
she was dead.

659
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,398
- Was that the funeral we saw yesterday?
- Yes.

660
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,750
- How did she die?
- Nobody knows.

661
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,436
- Can you take me to this cave?
- Yes.

662
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,232
We'll slip away from the fishing fleet
in the morning.

663
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,712
All right?

664
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,796
Now, where is this cave?

665
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,876
It's straight across.

666
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,956
The cave is over there.

667
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,596
Gas. Get over the side.

668
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,994
Quick!

669
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,037
Phosgene gas, to keep the visitors away.

670
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,870
Did you notice the sulphur on the walls?

671
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,956
- The yellow?
- Yes.

672
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,197
It was once an underground outlet
for the volcanic lava.

673
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,835
- There must be a long tunnel.
- Miles of it.

674
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,190
It leads all the way,

675
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,753
right up to the top.

676
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:50,075
That's where we have to go.
Can you make it?

677
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,760
Of course. It's business.

678
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,233
Good.

679
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,636
May I rest a moment?

680
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,716
Surely.

681
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,836
It's hard work.

682
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,838
Some honeymoon!

683
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:54,037
It's going down! lnto the volcano!

684
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,995
Heliport to position.

685
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,429
The honeymoon's over. Come on.

686
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,234
This volcano isn't active, is it?

687
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,590
It never has been. Not in my lifetime.

688
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,712
There's been some
terrific heat here recently.

689
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,831
What happened to the helicopter?

690
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,916
It's down there somewhere.

691
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,756
Come on.

692
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,711
Stand by. Mark.

693
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,910
Stand by for ten-second countdown.

694
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,758
10, 9, 8...

695
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,553
All units worldwide
will remain at readiness

696
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,830
so long as the spacecraft is in orbit.

697
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,991
..3, 2, 1.

698
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,756
Ignition.

699
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,997
This is it, gentlemen.
All we can do now is wait and pray.

700
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,237
Is that deep?

701
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,316
They usually are - very.

702
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,677
It's metal!

703
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,756
Wait here.

704
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,994
Heliport to takeoffposition.

705
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,878
Open crater.

706
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,677
Emergency crews to stations.

707
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,352
Go to Tanaka.
Tell him to come with every man he's got.

708
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,595
Yes.

709
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,234
Heliport to standbyposition.

710
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,269
Astronauts to dressing rooms.

711
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,076
Astronauts to dressing rooms.

712
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,832
Attention, attention.

713
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,316
American target vehicle is now in orbit.

714
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,237
Interception will take place
in two hours' time.

715
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,516
Washington, this is Houston.

716
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,596
Houston to Washington.

717
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,955
Our vehicle is now
120 nautical miles altitude,

718
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,234
170 miles downrange.

719
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:02,471
Jupiter to Houston,
we now have second phase.

720
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,511
Roger, Jupiter.

721
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,518
Four hours 36 minutes into the mission.

722
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:10,234
- Can you give us a time?
- Roger.

723
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,716
Connect igniter cable.

724
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,276
Connect igniter cable.

725
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,279
Radar technicians, report to control room.

726
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,397
Radar technicians, report to control room.

727
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,593
T minus 100 minutes and counting.

728
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,678
Did you volunteer for astronaut training?

729
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,837
In our country, we say cosmonaut.
Yes, both of us...

730
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,953
Yes, since six months we started training.

731
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,837
Good evening.

732
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,757
Who the hell are you?

733
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,235
Stand back, I'm gonna blow the lock.

734
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,356
Stand back.

735
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,436
Get into their uniforms.

736
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,590
Astronauts have two minutes.

737
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,676
Repeat, two minutes.

738
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:06,152
Reserve astronaut to stand by.

739
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,638
- Lock on target.
- Lock on target vehicle.

740
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,910
Check secondary guidance.

741
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:18,431
Launch time is now
T minus 90 minutes and counting.

742
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,949
Astronauts to launching pad.

743
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,150
Astronauts to launching pad.

744
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,829
Repeat, astronauts
to launching pad immediately.

745
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,199
Crews, stand by on gantry.

746
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,031
Crews, stand by on gantry.

747
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:48,114
- Stop that astronaut. Bring him to me.
- Stop that astronaut!

748
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:51,596
- Summon the reserve astronaut!
- Reserve astronaut!

749
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:55,349
Reserve astronaut
to launching pad, immediately.

750
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,678
Re-coordinate with target vehicle.

751
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,028
A new update

752
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:12,472
with target vehicle
has been received from computers.

753
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:17,999
We now have T minus seven minutes
and counting.

754
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:20,554
You made a mistake, my friend.

755
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:23,717
No astronaut enters the capsule
with his air conditioner.

756
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,512
Remove his helmet!

757
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,836
James Bond.

758
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,600
Allow me to introduce myself.

759
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,833
I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

760
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:44,713
They told me
you were assassinated in Hong Kong.

761
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,356
Yes, this is my second life.

762
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,516
You only live twice, Mr Bond.

763
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:54,200
Target vehicle
passing over central Russia.

764
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,356
Approaching Mongolia.

765
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,119
Track is as predicted. All computers...

766
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:02,437
As you see,
I am about to inaugurate a little war.

767
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,917
In a matter of hours, when America
and Russia have annihilated each other,

768
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,679
we shall see a new power
dominating the world.

769
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:13,873
- Target vehicle on scope.
- Brief check on target vehicle.

770
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,514
Remove his suit and search him.

771
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,632
Reserve astronaut ready on Bird 1.

772
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,314
Prepare for firing.

773
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,396
Clear the area.

774
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,356
Clear the area.

775
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,949
Emergency services to stand by.

776
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,876
Area now clear.

777
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:49,835
T minus one minute,
30 seconds and counting.

778
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:53,113
Re-coordinate with target vehicle.

779
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,196
Bird 1 now in readiness.

780
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:59,196
Astronauts ready on Bird.

01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,352
- Radar blackout commence.
- Radar blackout in operation.

783
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,240
Effective range, kilometres 800.

784
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:15,193
- Open crater.
- Opening crater.

785
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,636
Crater opening.

786
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,718

787
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:44,352
Gimbal the engines.
Pressurised tanks open.

788
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,358
Ventilator fans to full power.

789
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,595
10 seconds.

790
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,517

791
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:52,278

794
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,231
1 , 0.

795
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,590
Ignition.

796
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,998
Close crater!

797
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,076
Closing crater.

798
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:34,229
Open shutters!

800
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,595
Confirm acquisition.

801
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,870
Calling Bird 1.

802
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,310
You are 70 nautical miles downrange.
200 miles altitude.

803
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:25,432
Hans, our job will soon be done.

804
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,872
Blow them up as soon as they have
captured the Americans. Here is the key

805
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,355
to operate the exploder button.

806
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,630
There are men in the crater!

807
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,189
Crater guns, fire.

808
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,276
Crater guns, open fire.

809
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,750
The firing power inside my crater

810
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:06,075
is enough to annihilate a small army.

811
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,030
You can watch it all on TV.

812
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:12,118
It's the last programme
you're likely to see.

813
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:15,596
If I'm going to be forced
to watch television, may I smoke?

814
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,796
Yes. Give him his cigarettes.

815
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:22,356
It won't be the nicotine
that kills you, Mr Bond.

816
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,474
Armed guards to control room.

817
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,995
- Close the crater.
- Close crater!

818
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:01,590
I shall look forward personally
to exterminating you, Mr Bond.

819
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,272
Close the shutters.

820
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,670
We are now impregnable.

821
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,509
Interception takes place in eight minutes.
Nothing can prevent that.

822
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:40,075
Impregnable?

823
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:43,317
- Come with me, Mr Bond.
- Bird 1 to base. Locked on target.

824
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,954
- Osato?
- Yes, Number One?

825
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,551
Base calling Bird 1.

826
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:52,831
You are to assume full control
of operation from now on.

827
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,916
Seven minutes to interception.

828
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,996
Roger, Base One.

829
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:59,398
Houston, this is Hawaii.

830
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,476
We have an unidentified object on scope.

831
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,875
Order first alert. Arm all weapons.

832
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,639
Interception will occur in six minutes.

833
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:16,357
This is the price of failure, Mr Bond.

834
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,836
Come on.

835
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,876
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

836
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:49,953
There's an exploder button in the
control room. We've got to get up there.

837
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,036
Impossible. Too well defended.

838
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,596
Evacuate the control!

839
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,479
Evacuate the control!

840
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:24,678
Control room technicians.
There must be another way up there.

841
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:38,070
Give me cover till I get to the staircase.

842
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,276
Bon appétit.

843
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:38,599
Closing fast on our vehicle.
Orbit identical.

844
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:42,550
All units stand by for codeword.
Codeword is imminent.

845
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:45,353
I repeat, closing fast on our vehicle.

846
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,232
It's blown up! The enemy!

847
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,669
I repeat, the enemy has blown up.

848
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,189
All units will return to first alert.

849
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:24,517
Codeword is not -
I say again, not - imminent.

850
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,597
Tiger,

851
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,948
we've done it.

852
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:51,995
Down the tunnel!

853
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:12,316
Steady.

854
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,520
Now... about that honeymoon.

855
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:31,596
Why not?

856
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,870
But they'll never let you stay.

857
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,996
But they'll never find us.

858
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:05,950
- Dinghy's on board, sir.
- Tell him to come below and report.

859
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,389
It'll be a pleasure, sir.

860
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,956
