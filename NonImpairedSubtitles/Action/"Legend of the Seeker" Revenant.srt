[howling noise]

3
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:25,095
That spell, it's awakening the
dark spirits that guard this place.

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,931
It's a wolf.

5
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:35,262
The wizard who sold me this scroll swore
it was a spell of opening, not awakening.

6
00:00:35,312 --> 00:00:36,832
Then the evil spirits were already awake.

7
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:38,799
Stop thinking about spirits.

8
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,508
Let's think about the treasure that's inside.

9
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:46,233
Old idols with emeralds and ruby eyes.

10
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:49,726
Scabbed and encrusted with moon diamonds.

Don't be a fool.

16
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:47,244
It's not real.

17
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:55,129
Let's get those statues.

Ignaz!
Open that door!

RICHARD: The Seeker's last battle had been won.

28
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,323
But the Seeker was mortally wounded.

29
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:05,174
The Confessor knew that she too was dying,

30
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:07,573
but she had no thought for herself,

31
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:09,673
only for him.

32
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:18,001
Kieran.

33
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:20,113
My quest is finished.

34
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:23,417
And now, Vivian,

35
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:28,657
I am dying.

36
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:34,180
We die together,
as it should be.

37
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,943
RICHARD: Their deaths were witnessed
only by the Great Wizard Anfortas.

38
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:51,203
He picked up the sword,
knowing he must keep it hidden

39
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:54,173
until the rise of a new Seeker,

40
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:59,258
who might also be asked
to die for a glorious cause.

41
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:05,424
It's too bad they couldn't have lived
to see the world they've saved.

42
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,822
But they died, knowing
they'd fulfilled their destiny.

43
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:16,212
And...

44
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,509
at least they died together.

45
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,744
ZEDD: Soon we'll arrive at the crypt of Tavarang,

46
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:26,139
and you'll see wher the ancient Seeker lies buried.

47
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,454
And there, we'll hide the Box of Orden,
where Darken Rahl will never find it.

48
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:34,101
Are you sure the Box of Orden
will be safe there?

49
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:36,284
The outer door is sealed by magic.

50
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:40,728
And I have the only key to
the crypt where Kieran lies.

51
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:45,932
It's fitting that he will for one last time
help protect the world against evil.

52
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:55,376
Richard?

53
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:57,201
What is it?

54
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:01,698
I was thinking.

55
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,792
My quest will end
with the death of Darken Rahl.

56
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,028
Are you worried you won't succeed?

57
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:12,074
No, it's not that.

58
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:13,824
Then what?

59
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:17,855
The prophecy says I will defeat Rahl.

60
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,539
It doesn't say what will happen to us.

Here, look.
There's the story from the book.

64
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,713
There's the Sword of Truth.

65
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,644
It's hard to believe this is the same sword.

66
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,187
It's more than just a story.

67
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:43,460
This is it.

68
00:06:44,798 --> 00:06:46,791
The inner crypt where Kieran lies.

RICHARD: I would've liked to have known him.

71
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:20,702
ZEDD: Ancient Seeker,

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,934
you once defeated those who
would enslave the Midlands.

73
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,528
We ask you to keep this box safe

74
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:28,569
and aid us once again.

75
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:30,728
Take the box, Richard.

76
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:32,636
Place it inside with Kieran.

77
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:45,496
Where is the remains?

78
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,886
RICHARD: There's nothing here.
No bones, no burial cloth.

79
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:50,329
ZEDD: I don't understand.

80
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:54,921
This key has been held only by wizards
since the day Kieran was buried.

81
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,841
Something's not right.

00:08:21,555 --> 00:08:23,046
It sealed itself.

[magical incantation]

We must've sprung some sort of
magical trap when we opened the sarcophagus.

86
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,871
We need to find another way out.

87
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,635
Wandering around blindly
we'll get into even worse trouble.

88
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:53,096
Worse than being trapped alive
in an ancient tomb?

What was that?

Maybe this wasn't
some magical trap.

92
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:06,095
Maybe we're not alone in here.

ZEDD: Richard, be careful.

[sobbing continues]

What do you want?

113
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:50,348
Don't follow her.

114
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:54,792
RICHARD: She's crying.

115
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:57,437
She needs help.

116
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:05,434
How did she--?

117
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:07,414
She is not of our realm, Richard.

118
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,175
She's a spirit.

119
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:13,858
I thought that spirits were supposed
to spend eternity in the underworld.

120
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:16,302
Most spirits are
content in the underworld,

121
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:19,637
reunited with the people
that they loved in life.

122
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:23,611
But sometimes they have
unfinished business.

123
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,917
She was wearing a confessor's dress.

124
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,962
Maybe she was Vivian's spirit.

125
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:33,542
Vivian helped Kieran complete his quest.
She died with him.

126
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:36,936
What unfinished business
would she have?

127
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:40,147
Maybe she's trying to tell us.

128
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:49,624
There's a door here.

129
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:51,230
Maybe she was trying
to show us a way out?

130
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,525
Can you open it?

131

00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:10,835
You don't know what you're doing!

135
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,963
The door must not be opened!

136
00:12:17,472 --> 00:12:18,972
No!

137
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,056
Who are you?

138
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,858
Why did you attack us?

139
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:32,025
I came to steal treasure.

140
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,137
I didn't believe the tales of evil spirits.

141
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:38,251
But then I found myself possessed by one.

142
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:40,234
That light that left you?

143
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:44,078
It was the spirit who has owned me
for five long years.

144
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:50,152
It forced me to attack you
to keep you from opening that door.

145
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:51,382
Why?

146
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,375
This place is
full of great evil.

147
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:57,479
Get out.

148
00:12:57,565 --> 00:12:59,821
Get out while you still can.

149
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,226
We are dealing with
more than one spirit.

150
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:14,153
One of them led us to this door and the other
tried to kill us to keep us from opening it.

151
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:16,698
It could be a way out.

152
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:19,266
Restless spirits
are unpredictable.

153
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,776
I've heard stories of
the spirits of mothers

154
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:24,406
mourning for their children,
leading them to their deaths.

155
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:26,224
But Vivian was a confessor.

156
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:28,807
Even as a spirit she'd
never harm the Seeker.

157
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,822
We should open the door.

158
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:32,953
I don't know.

159
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:35,130
What choice do we have?
There is no other way out.

[magical incantation]

161
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:31,124
It's an ancient language.

162
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,943
The same as the
Book of Counted Shadows.

163
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,459
It says:

164
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,601
"Here lies Kieran, the True Seeker."

165
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,695
Why would his body be
hidden away in a plain casket

166
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,983
when a secret crypt
was built just for him?

167
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,237
We don't know for certain
that his body is even in there.

168
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,081
Let's find out.

169
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,422
Richard, don't.

170
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:55,184
You don't know what's in there.

171
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,236
RICHARD: Someone's cut off his head.

172
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:10,516
Why?

173
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:12,621
This is a wizard's spell.

174
00:15:13,756 --> 00:15:15,814
These magical bindings
keep the spirit

175
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,486
from moving to it's final
resting place in the underworld.

176
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:21,366
So he's never been reunited with
his family, his loved ones?

177
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:24,372
That must be why Vivian walks here.

178
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,208
That's why she was crying.

179
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,106
Because the Seeker is trapped here.

180
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:29,911
She can't be with him.

181
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:33,484
And she's been waiting for a thousand years
to be reunited with him.

182
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:37,338
We might wait for her for the next
thousand years if we don't find a way out.

183
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,436
I think this is our way out.

184
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:46,112
Maybe Vivian trapped us here because
she wanted us to help Kieran.

185
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:50,003
And maybe, once Kieran's free,
she'll free us too.

186
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,938
Undoing another wizard's
magic is a violation.

187
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,959
So is beheading a Seeker.

188
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:59,861
Kieran gave up everything for his quest.

189
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:02,122
His spirit should be with
his father, his mother,

190
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,634
his confessor.

191
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,774
People he loved.

192
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:09,479
Not trapped here alone in the dark.

193
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:13,167
I agree, it's terrible, but wizards
don't do things like this lightly.

194
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,170
Who knows what will happen
if we unbind him?

195
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,995
We can't leave him like this,
alone.

196
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:23,851
Think of everything he sacrificed.

197
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:32,614
I sincerely hope I don't
end up regretting this.

198
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:36,587
ZEDD: As I destroy these bindings,

199
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:39,748
so shall this spirit be free.

200
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:45,307
As this cloth is consumed by flame,

201
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:51,837
so shall the bindings release.

202
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:57,355
[crumbling sound]

203
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:19,399
Richard!

204
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:23,652
Can you hear me, boy?

205
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:30,962
I'm fine.

206
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:42,272
Are you sure you're not hurt?

207
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:47,332
ZEDD: Now let's see if that door is open.

208
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,493
Not yet.

209
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:52,011
Kieran's spirit is free,
but his body is still hidden,

210
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,542
like something shameful.

211
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,406
We need to return him to the crypt.

212
00:17:58,787 --> 00:17:59,987
[Zedd groans]

213
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:06,063
KAHLAN: When the road you walk is dark,
may you always see the light ahead.

214
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:10,850
May you always remember
that you do not walk alone.

215
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:18,566
ZEDD: Now that Kieran is laid to rest,

216
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:22,334
let us hope our task here is done.

217
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:23,931
Lead the way.

218
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:31,405
[threatening music...]

219
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:34,927
Richard, what are you doing?

220
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:38,613
Richard!

221
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:42,531
It's not Richard anymore.

222
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:45,423
It's Kieran.

223
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:49,831
Fight this, Richard.

224
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:52,434
Fight this spirit that possesses you.

225
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,107
He can't hear you anymore.

226
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,725
Richard freed your spirit,
and this is how you repay him?

227
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:07,282
I'm taking back what that wizard Anfortas
stole from me a thousand years ago.

228
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,366
What are you talking about?

229
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:15,612
He didn't understand the bond

230
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:20,286
between Confessor and Seeker.

231
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,498
And he betrayed me.

232
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,671
ANFORTAS: Kieran, Vivian must leave us.

233
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,113
Why?

234
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:32,608
There is too much between you.

235
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:34,506
I see it in oyur eyes.

236
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:37,961
- You love her.
- We've done nothing wrong.

237
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:39,424
Yet.

238
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,809
I have watched the
two of you growing closer.

239
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:44,123
Vivian has become a distraction,

240
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,461
and that's putting your quest in jeopardy.

241
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:51,611
I swear I will
remain true to my quest,

242
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:54,957
but you must swear
you won't send her away.

243
00:19:57,611 --> 00:19:58,755
Swear it.

244
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,415
I swear.

245
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:08,158
But Enfortas lied to me.

246
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:11,518
Just as you lied to him.

247
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:17,295
I'm a confessor.
I can see that you loved Vivian.

248
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,210
What if I did?

249
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:24,529
My feelings for Vivian
weren't keeping me from my quest.

250
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,607
But Anfortas wouldn't trust me.

251
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:32,257
Vivian. Vivian!

252
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:33,514
Wait!

253
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:35,978
Where are you going?

254
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:39,770
Anfortas thinks that it's too dangerous
for me to stay at your side.

255
00:20:40,787 --> 00:20:42,004
How could the?

256
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:44,415
He swore he wouldn't send you away.

257
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,396
He said that you think more of me
than you do of your quest.

258
00:20:47,431 --> 00:20:48,773
Oh Vivian.

259
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:51,091
We belong to each other.

260
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,826
We never can,
and you know why.

261
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,824
Because your love would enslave me?

262
00:20:56,294 --> 00:20:57,371
Yes.

263
00:20:57,766 --> 00:21:00,173
Vivian, there's no harm
you could do to me.

264
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:02,992
Kieran.

265
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,321
Vivian.

266
00:21:04,993 --> 00:21:07,295
I will already do
anything that you ask,

267
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,410
because I'm already yours to command.

268
00:21:30,377 --> 00:21:31,799
She gave in to her passion.

269
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:33,752
And you were confessed.

270
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,524
She violated her
most sacred duty,

271
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:39,307
to protect the Seeker.

272
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,435
No.

273
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:46,702
Our love only
strengthened our bond.

274
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,821
But Anfortas thought as you did.

275
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:52,806
He was determined to destroy us.

276
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:56,262
What you did was wrong.

277
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:59,825
What you're doing now is wrong.

278
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:03,641
You have to release the Seeker.

279
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:05,600
Release him?

280
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:08,561
Why would I do that?

281
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:13,205
What good does it do you to possess
his body when Vivian is only a spirit,

282
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,806
waiting for you to join
her in the underworld?

283
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,113
Stay back!

284
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:37,584
You won't do anything to hurt me.

285
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:41,652
You hurt me,
you hurt your Seeker.

286
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:51,349
I have no intention
to join Vivian in the Underworld.

287
00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:52,767
I have a body now.

288
00:23:04,437 --> 00:23:06,000
And once I finish with this grace,

289
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:08,302
Vivian will have a body too.

290
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,560
Yours.

291
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:26,595
Richard!

292
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,059
Kahlan!

293
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:47,991
Stay back, creature,

294
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,131
or I'll blast you back to whatever
dark hole you came from.

295
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:57,010
If you do that, you, your Seeker
and your Confessor will be trapped

296
00:23:57,147 --> 00:23:59,534
in this tomb for all eternity.

297
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,645
Who are you?

298
00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:06,383
I am the spirit of Anfortas.

299
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,569
Wizard to Kieran.

300
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:11,437
Now when your Seeker killed this body,

301
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,609
I've used an ancient spell of
awakening to occupy it once more.

302
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:19,811
But I only have a thousand
heatbeats before it dies again,

303
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:21,343
so listen to me.

304
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:24,359
- Can you open this door?
- Not until you listen to me.

305
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,611
I'm the one that tried to stop
you from unbinding Kieran's body.

306
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:30,620
Why?

307
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:34,958
Because the story you know
of Kieran is a lie.

308
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,294
KAHLAN: How did you come to learn this magic?

309
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,204
Maybe you don't know as much
about Seekers as you thought.

310
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:50,539
ANFORTAS: One thousand years ago,

311
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:55,419
Kieran and Vivian did the worst thing
a Seeker and a Confessor could do.

312
00:24:56,898 --> 00:25:00,069
- They consummated their love.
- Yes.

313
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:02,378
And it ruined Kieran.

314
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:06,496
He let Count Elrond, his greatest foe,
slip through his fingers

315
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,745
because he thought only of protecting Vivian.

316
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:10,885
I need to protect my Seeker,

317
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,652
my Confessor.
Now open this door!

318
00:25:13,687 --> 00:25:15,095
You must listen to me!

319
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:18,761
I went to Vivian

320
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:23,178
and made it clear she had
a terrible decision to make.

321
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:27,746
He is unsure in battle.
He thinks of nothing but you.

322
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:30,182
You must release him.

323
00:25:33,476 --> 00:25:35,331
Do you know what you're asking?

324
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:40,884
There is only one way to
release a confessed man.

325
00:25:42,485 --> 00:25:47,982
The Seeker can not fulfill his destiny
as long as you are alive.

326
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,217
ZEDD: Has she defied you,

327
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:04,286
the Seeker remained confessed
and failed his quest because of it.

328
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:05,818
No, wizard.

329
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,156
Vivian knew her duty.

330
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:11,976
Vivian!

331
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,830
Vivian, where are you?

332
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,210
Vivian.

333
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:22,658
Vivian, what have you done?

334
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,852
What I had to, Kieran.

335
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:36,036
I will wait for you in the underworld.

336
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:37,332
No.

337
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:38,911
Vivian.

338
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,819
No, Vivian,
you can't leave me.

339
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:52,868
Kieran.

340
00:26:58,037 --> 00:27:00,336
You have betrayed me, Anfortas.

341
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,991
I will never stop loving Vivian

342
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,056
or hating you!

343
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:07,878
I've never seen a look
full of such loathing.

344
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:12,389
But we had a quest to complete.

345
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:16,304
I thought once Kieran was no
longer under Vivian's control,

346
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,066
his grief would fade,

347
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:19,846
and he would come back to himself.

348
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:21,998
But he didn't.

349
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:24,642
A normal man,
freed from his Confessor,

350
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:27,084
would return to his former life
as if nothing had happened.

351
00:27:27,374 --> 00:27:31,468
But a Seeker and a Confessor
have a special bond.

352
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:34,958
It's stronger than even I could fathom.

353
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:37,891
And even Vivian's dath could break it.

354
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:41,722
It was as if Kieran's soul
had been torn from him,

355
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,123
leaving nothing but anger and hate.

356
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:46,089
When he took up the sword again--

357
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:48,549
The Sword of Truth feeds on rage.

358
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,585
It made his anger grow.

359
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,558
It overtook him.

360
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,964
It drove him mad.

361
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:58,856
[screaming with rage]

362
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:04,732
ANFORTAS: These people weren't soldiers.

363
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,271
You have betrayed innocence.

364
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,846
This world has no innocence.

365
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:12,917
You have betrayed your quest.

366
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,651
You have tarnished the name of Seeker.

367
00:28:15,686 --> 00:28:17,863
And you took everything from me!

368
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:25,646
Vivian and I won't be kept apart.

369
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,014
Even if you kill me,
you won't stop me.

370
00:28:30,856 --> 00:28:31,986
I must!

371
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:34,965
I will!

372
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:46,258
I feared Kieran's vow,

373
00:28:47,063 --> 00:28:49,938
that he wouldn't rest,
even in death.

374
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,984
I realize in my prey
of the spirits of the underworld,

375
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,493
destroying the peace they'd found in life.

376
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:00,811
So I had to bind his spirit.

377
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:03,974
If you had allowed his spirit
to reunite with Vivian,

378
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,791
then Kieran would've found peace
and none of this would be happening!

379
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:08,895
If you hadn't unbound Kieran,

380
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:12,194
Kieran wouldn't be trying
to reunite with Vivian now...

381
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:13,717
in the flesh.

382
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:15,581
[magical incantation]

383
00:29:26,662 --> 00:29:28,462
[magical incantation]

384
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:41,475
Vivian?

385
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:45,981
Kieran.

386
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,931
My love.

387
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,124
He's using Kahlan's
body as a vessel.

388
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,521
Richard will be confessed.

389
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:08,866
Yes.

390
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:12,526
He'll become a monster,
just like Kieran.

391
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:16,210
Finally what the wizard
stole from us is ours,

392
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:17,461
forever.

393
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:25,127
I have enough power left to cast a spell

394
00:30:26,277 --> 00:30:28,228
that will keep him here in the crypt.

395
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:29,759
Forever.

396
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,462
You can't do that!

397
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:35,982
Without the Seeker, Darken Rahl will
conquer the world. Thousands will die.

398
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:39,856
And how many will die if Kieran's
wrath is unleashed upon the world again?

399
00:30:39,891 --> 00:30:43,941
Then let me into the tomb and I will drive
Kieran's spirit from Richard's body.

400
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:47,545
And if you cannot?

401
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,148
Are you willing to kill your Seeker?

402
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,530
No.

403
00:31:05,913 --> 00:31:07,099
This is wrong.

404
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:08,644
We can't do this.

405
00:31:10,716 --> 00:31:15,250
We sacrificed our love.
Once we deserve to be happy together.

406
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:23,177
You said you would wait for me,
and you did.

407
00:31:23,468 --> 00:31:24,927
We're finally together.

408
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:27,952
We can't throw this chance away.

409
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:31,070
Richard is more than just the Seeker to me.

410
00:31:31,404 --> 00:31:32,932
That was Kieran to me.

411
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:36,475
I loved him,
protected him, taught him.

412
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,839
So I hesitated because I loved him.

413
00:31:39,874 --> 00:31:43,325
That hesitation led not only
to the loss of many innocent lives,

414
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:46,295
it led to the loss of Kieran's soul too.

415
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:50,704
You led a wizard to my hiding place
where Anfortas had bound me.

416
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:54,203
Why would you do that if you
didn't want us to be together?

417
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:57,268
I only did that
so that he would free your spirit.

418
00:31:57,886 --> 00:32:00,142
So we could be together
in the underworld.

419
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:03,494
Our love is beyond flesh.

420
00:32:04,104 --> 00:32:07,758
That is a lie that the wizard told us,

421
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:11,637
so we would be content to live without
something everyone else takes for granted.

422
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:14,129
But this Confessor,
this Seeker,

423
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:15,941
they have a destiny too.

424
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,123
A destiny that is destroying them,
just as it did us.

425
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:24,935
They love each other.
I know you can feel it.

426
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:31,746
This will be a way for them
to be together too.

427
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:34,793
Oh, Vivian.

428
00:32:36,077 --> 00:32:39,410
I've wanted to touch you for so long.

429
00:32:39,445 --> 00:32:42,391
And I missed you so much.

430
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,507
This is all that matters.

431
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,951
We're all that matters.

432
00:32:51,758 --> 00:32:54,275
If you tell me you don't love me,
I will release you.

433
00:32:57,118 --> 00:32:58,640
Tell me you don't love me,

434
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:01,031
that you don't want me.

435
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,958
I can't tell you that.

436
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:27,337
ANFORTAS: The door to the outside world is open.

437
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:31,189
If you're unwilling to do your duty,
wizard, then leave.

438
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:37,426
I will do my duty as First Wizard.
Now let me in!

439
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:48,079
[magical incantation]

440
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,532
[magical incantation]

441
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:40,855
You said you could open it.

442
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:42,528
ANFORTAS: This body is weakening.

443
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:44,087
I'm not strong enough.

444
00:35:45,284 --> 00:35:48,012
Maybe if you join me.

445
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,091
[magical incantation]

446
00:36:07,035 --> 00:36:08,235
[groans in pain]

447
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:10,689
Look!

448
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:13,953
Remember what happened to Kieran.

449
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:18,273
Death is not the worst fate
that can befall a Seeker.

450
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,557
No!

451
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:40,446
Stay away, Wizard.
Your Seeker and Confessor are gone.

452
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:44,098
Kieran, stop!
What are you doing?

453
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:48,141
This time the story
is gonna end the way it's supposed to.

454
00:36:53,357 --> 00:36:54,880
I won't let you kill him.

455
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:59,048
Vivian, don't make the Seeker lose everything
for a love that is not even his.

456
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,046
And what about my love for Kieran?

457
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:04,542
Go back to the underworld
and let Kieran follow you there.

458
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:09,062
I trusted Anfortas and I waited in
the underworld for a thousand years!

459
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:11,568
- Alone!
- That won't happen this time.

460
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:12,601
No.

461
00:37:13,001 --> 00:37:15,195
You'll bind him again
and we'll never be together.

462
00:37:15,971 --> 00:37:19,154
I left him once.
I'll never leave him again.

463
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:21,653
No!

464
00:37:34,245 --> 00:37:36,007
Anfortas was right about one thing.

465
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:38,897
A Confessor can be replaced.
A Seeker cannot.

466
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:41,887
Stop it!
What are you doing?

467
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:44,130
I will do anything to
protect the Seeker.

468
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,140
Including killing his Confessor!

469
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,472
I will drive Vivian from this body
and I will bind her spirit

470
00:37:49,507 --> 00:37:52,769
so that you'll never be together,
in this world or the next.

471
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:53,938
Please!

472
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:58,611
then leave Richard's body and I will allow
Vivian to follow you in the underworld.

473
00:37:58,705 --> 00:37:59,789
Kieran.

474
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:02,362
Why should I believe you?

475
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:05,237
Because I do not Anfortas.

476
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:08,257
I believe a Seeker and a Confessor
belong together, Kieran.

477
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:12,982
In the Underworld, you and Vivian
can exist in peace.

478
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:15,102
But you can't be together here.

479
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:19,753
Your only choice is to trust me, Seeker.

480
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:35,115
Then this time, Vivian, it is I
who'll be waiting for you in the underworld.

481
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:58,947
You're free, Vivian.

482
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:01,321
Go find him.

483
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:04,179
Thank you, wizard.

484
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:51,671
Obviously we can't leave the box
in this cursed place.

485
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:56,901
The Story of Vivian and Kieran,
the one that's in the book...

486
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,188
it's been handed down for a thousand years.

487
00:39:59,223 --> 00:40:00,501
Passed down as truth.

488
00:40:00,894 --> 00:40:02,689
Maybe it was a necessary lie.

489
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:04,322
People need a heroe.

490
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,735
So the legend can be preserved
no matter what the truth is?

491
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:10,333
I won't judge Anfortas
for changing the story.

492
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:13,224
It's a great responsibility
to name a Seeker.

493
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:16,777
One mistake and send
them spiralling into darkness.

494
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,570
When Kieran possessed me,
I sensed that darkness.

495
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:23,585
And there was something else.

496
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,296
Something I've never felt before.

497
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,640
A power.

498
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:28,817
Magical power.

499
00:40:28,852 --> 00:40:31,687
Kieran had magic.
He was strong enough to draw a grace.

500
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:33,005
How could he do that?

501
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,749
It's Rahl.

502
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:50,640
- I don't understand.
- It's a tracer cloud.

503
00:40:51,528 --> 00:40:52,866
Powerful magic.

504
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,929
He's tracking us.

505
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,735
I don't think it's us he's focused on.

506
00:40:58,335 --> 00:40:59,939
It's the Box of Orden.

507
00:41:00,982 --> 00:41:03,281
I'll cast a Spell of Obscuring.

508
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:07,085
[magical incantation]

509
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:16,563
Following the box won't be
such an easy task for him now.

510
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:20,761
Where do we take it?

511
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:24,054
Not we. I.

512
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,395
You can't go off on your own.

513
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:30,433
I won't allow the box to be the beacon
that leads Rahl to Richard.

514
00:41:35,445 --> 00:41:38,125
I'll rejoin you once I'll hide it.

515
00:41:38,175 --> 00:41:38,627
Where?

516
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:42,342
It's safer if only I
know the answer to that.

517
00:41:43,057 --> 00:41:45,197
I'll find you once
the box is hidden.

518
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,699
I don't need to tell you both...

519
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:50,581
Be careful.

520
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,366
I don't like it when
Zedd goes off by himself.

521
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:07,908
He's willing to take the risk
for the sake of your quest.

522
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,379
In the crypt he was ready to sacrifice you.

523
00:42:12,814 --> 00:42:14,555
He was jsut doing what he had to.

524
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,533
To keep us from becomeing
like Vivian and Kieran.

525
00:42:19,422 --> 00:42:20,773
That won't happen.

526
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:23,489
They probably thought the same thing.

527
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:27,841
But in that moment of weakness,
they lost everything.

528
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,985
You know, we're stronger than they were.

529
00:42:31,703 --> 00:42:33,009
I hope you're right.

530
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:37,011
Love isn't something to fear, Kahlan.

531
00:42:39,754 --> 00:42:41,340
For me it is.

532
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:44,798
