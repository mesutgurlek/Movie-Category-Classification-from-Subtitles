And the greatest and strongest
of all these heroes...

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,354
was the mighty Hercules.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,074

ofa true hero ?

- A god ?
- A god ?

[ Yelling ]

1358
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,678
Hercules, stop !
You can't do this to me. You can't--

1359
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,517
[ Muffled ]
Fine. Okay. Listen.

1360
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,870
Hah ! Okay. Well, I deserved that.
Herc, Herc, Herc.

1361
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,639
Can we talk ?
Y-Your dad, he's a fun guy, right ?

1362
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,716
So maybe you could
put in a word with him,

1363
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,956
and he'd kinda blow this
whole thing off, you know ?

1364
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:09,117
Meg, Meg, talk to him.
A little schmooze--

[ Screaming ]

1366
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,349
Eew ! Get away from me !
Don't touch me !

1367
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,835
Get your slimy souls off me !

1368
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,509
- Ooh, ah--
- He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

1369
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,313
You mean, if he gets outta there.

1370
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,874
- If. If is good.
- Taxi!

1371
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,390
I don't feel so good.
I feel a little-- [ Screaming ]

[ Sighing ]

1373
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:53,677
Wonderboy, what--
Why did you--

1374
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,509
[ Chuckles ]
People always do crazy things...

1375
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,915
when they're in love.

1376
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,870
Whoa ! Hey, hey, hey !
Whoo !

1377
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:21,597
[ Cheering, Applauding ]

1378
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,756
Three cheers for the mighty Hercules !

1379
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,599
Oh, yeah !
Flowers for everybody ! Oh !

1380
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,793
[ Applause, Cheering Continue ]

1381
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,036
Hercules, we're so proud of you.

1382
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,957
Mother.

1383
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,794
Hah !
Fine work, my boy !

1384
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,629
You've done it !
You're a true hero.

1385
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,117
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.

1386
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:01,437
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength,

1387
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:05,109
but by the strength of his heart.

1388
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:09,870
Now, at last, my son,

1389
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,594
you can come home.

[ Cheering ]

1391
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,712
Congratulations, Wonderboy.
You'll make one heck of a god.

1392
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,193
[ Cheering Continues ]

1393
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,991
Father, this is the moment
I've always dreamed of.

1394
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:45,510
But...

1395
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:50,270
a life without Meg,
even an immortal life,

1396
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,994
would be... empty.

1397
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,155
I--

1398
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,635
I wish to stay on Earth with her.

1399
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,320
I finally know where I belong.
