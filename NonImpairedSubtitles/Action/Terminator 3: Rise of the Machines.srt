1
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:50,893
The future has not been written.

2
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,856
There is no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

3
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,540
I wish I could believe that.

4
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:18,212
My name is John Connor.

5
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:21,966
They tried to murder me
before I was born.

6
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:26,429
When I was 13, they tried again.

7
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:29,724
Machines from the future.

8
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:32,518
Terminators.

9
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:37,231
All my life, my mother told me
the storm was coming.

10
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,650
-Judgment Day.
-Connor!

11
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:43,738
The beginning of a war
between man and machines.

12
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:49,410
Three billion lives
would vanish in an instant.

13
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:55,708
And I would lead what was left
of the human race to ultimate victory.

14
00:02:58,252 --> 00:02:59,921
It hasn't happened.

15
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:02,465
No bombs fell.

16
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:06,177
Computers didn't take control.

17
00:03:07,094 --> 00:03:10,556
We stopped Judgment Day.

18
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:15,811
I should feel safe...

19
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:18,939
...but I don't.

20
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:23,069
So I live off the grid.

21
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:27,782
No phone, no address.

22
00:03:27,948 --> 00:03:32,620
No one and nothing can find me.

23
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:37,124
I've erased all connections
to the past.

24
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:40,628
But as hard as I try...

25
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:43,964
...I can't erase my dreams...

26
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:47,009
...my nightmares.

27
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,752
I feel the weight of the future
bearing down on me.

28
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:06,422
A future I don't want.

29
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:10,217
So I keep running...

30
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:12,344
...as fast as I can.

31
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:15,973
Anywhere.

32
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,475
Nowhere.

33
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,248
Oh, my God.

34
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,291
Are you okay?

35
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:09,545
Do you want me to call 911?

36
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,717
l like this car.

37
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:17,970
What are you--?

38
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:24,328
You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

39
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:26,830
Slow down and pull over immediately.

40
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:02,741
Lady, have you any idea
how fast you were going?

41
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:04,868
Let me see your license
and registration.

42
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,165
l like your gun.

43
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,542
What?

44
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:18,090
This stupid thing's not working.

45
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:21,468
What's wrong with this thing?

46
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:24,805
l hate machines.

47
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:29,768
-Hello?
-Kate, it's your father.

48
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,271
You're blowing me off again.

49
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:36,650
l'm so sorry. You know how much
l wanted to see you this weekend.

50
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:41,780
-We're having computer problems--
-l know, you can't talk about it.

51
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,448
lt's just...

52
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:46,535
...Scott was really looking forward
to this.

53
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:51,707
Katie. I wish I had more time
to get to know him. I really do.

54
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:55,752
That's okay. You're bound
to run into him at the wedding.

55
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:59,172
Please. l'm still
in a state of denial about that.

56
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:02,759
-You're not the only one.
-Hey, kiddo.

57
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:05,387
You don't need me
to pass judgment on this guy.

58
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:07,889
You've done the right thing
your whole life.

59
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,434
You won't make a mistake.
You never do.

60
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,895
I'm the luckiest father
in the world, you know?

61
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:17,482
l've never had to be afraid
for my daughter.

62
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,486
Listen, I hate this. I gotta run. Come
see me. I promise I won't cancel.

63
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:22,821
We will.

64
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:25,907
-Bye, Dad, I love you.
-Love you too.

65
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,507
-Okay, what have we got?
-This new computer virus is tricky.

66
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:46,386
lt's infected half the civilian lnternet
as well as secondary military apps.

67
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:49,347
-Payroll, inventory.
-Primary defence nets are still clean?

68
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:51,766
So far the firewalls are holding up.

69
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:55,729
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we
use our Al to scan the infrastructure.

70
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:58,356
Search and destroy
for any hint of the virus.

71
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:01,860
l know, Tony, but that's like
going after a fly with a bazooka.

72
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:04,654
Once the connection's made,
it should only be a few minutes.

73
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:09,201
During which we put everything under
the control of one computer system.

74
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:12,162
The most intelligent system
ever conceived.

75
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:15,290
l still prefer to keep humans
in the loop.

76
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:17,626
l'm not sure Skynet's ready.

77
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,711
Yes, sir.

78
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,223
Thanks.

79
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,087
You're supposed to go around
to the back.

80
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,221
Hey, l said you're supposed to go--

81
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:55,843
-Take off your clothes.
-Patience, honey.

82
00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:04,811
Bitch. Wait your turn.

83
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:08,022
-Your clothes.
-Talk to the hand.

84
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:12,527
Now.

85
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:34,150
Welcome to Jim's Burgers.
Can I take your order?

86
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,154
-Jose Barrera?
-Yeah, that's me.

87
00:16:56,672 --> 00:17:00,343
Growing concern over widespread
outages in the global digital network...

88
00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:03,930
...have prompted rumours
of a new computer super-virus.

89
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:07,683
-Wall Street analysts are confident....
-Shit! My mom's home.

90
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,937
Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer.
Here. Take that.

91
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:13,981
Go, go, go.

92
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,615
Elizabeth and William Anderson?

93
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:27,745
l'm Bill. My sister's upstairs.
ls there something wrong?

94
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:42,385
What's going on?

95
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:45,763
l have to go to the clinic.
lt's an emergency.

96
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:48,099
lt's 4:30 in the morning.

97
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,978
Well, l'll be back before you get up.

98
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:37,982
Cool it, guys, it's just me.

99
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:41,527
We've got a sick cat coming in.

100
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:04,592
Great.

101
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:07,178
Junkies.

102
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:14,435
Please, don't do that.

103
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:20,691
l suppose it was you who
ripped us off last week.

104
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:23,694
Put the phone down.

105
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,781
Sorry.

106
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:28,657
l just....

107
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,910
l needed some medicine.

108
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:34,705
There's an emergency clinic
half a mile away.

109
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:36,457
Can't do that.

110
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:43,923
How much did you take?

111
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,883
-Enough.
-Well...

112
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:49,720
...this is the stuff we use
to chemically neuter dogs.

113
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:54,016
Take a look.

114
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:57,311
Hey!

115
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:05,027
Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

116
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:08,364
Next time bring a clue,
not a paintball gun.

117
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:12,034
-No, this isn't what you think.
-Yeah, right.

118
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:35,057
l think Hercules has got pneumonia.
He started coughing and won't stop.

119
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:39,687
-Betsy, l've got a problem in the back.
-A problem? This is an emergency!

120
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:43,482
-lt sounds like a hairball.
-l know what a hairball sounds like.

121
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:46,777
-Where's Dr. Monroe?
-lt's 5:30 in the morning.

122
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:50,239
l'm sure he's home sleeping.
He'll come in if he has to.

123
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:55,703
Just wait in here with Hercules
and l'll be a few minutes, all right?

124
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:15,681
Mike Kripke's basement.

125
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:19,226
What? What does that mean?

126
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:33,324
You're John Connor.

127
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:41,081
l'm Kate Brewster.

128
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,587
We went to
West Hills Junior High together.

129
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:54,261
-Jesus.
-What happened to you, John?

130
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:58,557
Middle of eighth grade,
you just disappeared.

131
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:02,061
And there was that thing
about your foster parents.

132
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:04,938
Yeah, they were murdered.

133
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:09,401
l didn't do it.

134
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:12,905
What the hell?

135
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:15,699
ls somebody with you?

136
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:39,598
Katherine Brewster?

137
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,825
No.

138
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:50,729
John Connor was here.
Where did he go?

139
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:54,191
Tell me. Where did he go?

140
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,399
Katherine Brewster?

141
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:42,656
What are you doing? Let me down!

142
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:46,243
Let me down! Let me down!

143
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:50,956
Where is John Connor?

144
00:25:51,123 --> 00:25:54,000
lf l tell you, will you let me go?

145
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:56,336
Yes.

146
00:25:56,503 --> 00:25:58,839
He's...

147
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:02,175
...in the kennel, in a cage.

148
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:08,056
You said that you'd let me go.

149
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:09,808
l lied.

150
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:15,397
Please, please, please.
You have to let me go!

151
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:06,239
John Connor.

152
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:10,535
lt is time.

153
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:14,205
You here to kill me?

154
00:27:20,003 --> 00:27:23,089
No. You must live.

155
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:35,060
Why are you here?

156
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:37,729
-Where are we going?
-Keep moving.

157
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:42,776
Get out of here.

158
00:27:43,902 --> 00:27:45,612
Now!

159
00:28:34,452 --> 00:28:36,955
-No pulse.
-See if you can get him down.

160
00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:40,458
l can't.

161
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,669
This guy weighs a ton.

162
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:10,447
-911.
-Yes. Yes. l'm being kidnapped.

163
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:14,159
-Where are you now?
-l don't know where. l'm in my truck.

164
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,828
lt's a Toyota Tundra.

165
00:29:17,162 --> 00:29:22,417
lt says '' Emery Animal Hospital'' on
the side. l'm locked inside the back.

166
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:24,836
Hello?

167
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,047
Hello?

168
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:32,760
Shit! Shit!

169
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,294
Get off.

170
00:31:04,435 --> 00:31:05,478
Let me out!

171
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:07,355
What are you doing here?

172
00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:10,066
You tell me. You got me into this.

173
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:12,735
-Stop the car.
-l can't. Not yet.

174
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:16,948
-You bastard! Stop the car!
-Shut up!

175
00:31:28,543 --> 00:31:30,962
Son of a bitch.

176
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:33,548
Goddamn it.

177
00:31:33,715 --> 00:31:35,717
Look what you did to my car.

178
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:39,178
This is my company car, asshole.

179
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:40,888
Get your ass out here.

180
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:43,266
Get your ass out of the car. Now!

181
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:45,309
What are you doing?

182
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:48,604
lf you don't have insurance,
l'm gonna rip your balls off.

183
00:31:48,771 --> 00:31:51,023
-l don't want any problems, okay?
-Shut up!

184
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:52,316
Help!

185
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,736
Who's talking back there?
What's going on?

186
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,112
-Calm down.
-Shut up!

187
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:00,032
-l'm being kidnapped! Call the police!
-Well, l'll be goddamned.

188
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:02,076
-Call 911!
-A cop when you need one.

189
00:32:02,243 --> 00:32:04,078
Help, please! Please!

190
00:32:04,495 --> 00:32:07,081
Let me out of here! Help!

191
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:12,545
Get back here, asshole!

192
00:32:35,193 --> 00:32:37,445
That's the cops!
You have to pull over!

193
00:32:37,612 --> 00:32:39,238
Yeah, first chance l get.

194
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:46,305
Hold on!

195
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,461
Stop it!

196
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:05,528
l'll drive.

197
00:36:12,326 --> 00:36:13,953
Get out.

198
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:12,594
Excuse me.

199
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,182
Move over.

200
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:30,547
No sign of brain trauma.

201
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:34,635
Yeah, l'm fine, thanks.

202
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:41,391
Do you even remember me?

203
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:46,063
Sarah Connor?
Blowing up Cyberdyne?

204
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:49,608
''Hasta la vista, baby.''
Ring any bells?

205
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:52,277
That was a different T-101.

206
00:38:52,736 --> 00:38:55,155
What, do you come off
an assembly line or something?

207
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:56,532
Exactly.

208
00:38:57,366 --> 00:39:00,661
Oh, man. l'm gonna have
to teach you everything all over again.

209
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:05,707
Katherine Brewster,
have you sustained injury?

210
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:08,544
Drop dead, you asshole!

211
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:12,256
l'm unable to comply.

212
00:39:21,515 --> 00:39:23,267
Where are you taking me?

213
00:39:23,433 --> 00:39:25,602
To a safe location.

214
00:39:42,244 --> 00:39:44,788
All right, get off at the next exit.
Let her out.

215
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:48,208
Negative.
Katherine Brewster must be protected.

216
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:52,004
-l thought they were after me.
-You could not be located.

217
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,675
So a T-X was sent back through time
to eliminate your lieutenants.

218
00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:01,638
So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

219
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:08,020
No, no.
No, you shouldn't even exist.

220
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:10,731
l mean, we took out Cyberdyne
over 10 years ago.

221
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:14,735
-We stopped Judgment Day.
-You only postponed it.

222
00:40:14,901 --> 00:40:17,112
Judgment Day is inevitable.

223
00:40:24,578 --> 00:40:26,621
l require a cutting tool.

224
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:35,839
Here, take the wheel.

225
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:42,679
-What are you doing?
-l am powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

226
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:46,141
My primary cell was damaged
by a plasma attack.

227
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:50,437
T-X is designed for extreme combat,
driven by a plasma reactor...

228
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:52,564
...and equipped
with onboard weapons.

229
00:40:52,731 --> 00:40:54,066
lts arsenal includes...

230
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:56,818
...nanotechnological transjectors.

231
00:40:56,985 --> 00:41:00,864
-Meaning?
-lt can control other machines.

232
00:41:02,908 --> 00:41:07,996
lts body chassis is heavily armoured
and hardened to withstand attack.

233
00:41:09,956 --> 00:41:12,334
-You'll find a way to destroy her.
-Unlikely.

234
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:14,711
l'm an obsolete design.

235
00:41:14,878 --> 00:41:19,216
T-X is faster, more powerful
and more intelligent.

236
00:41:19,382 --> 00:41:22,344
lt's a far more effective
killing machine.

237
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:24,346
Oh, great.

238
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:25,764
That's great.

239
00:41:27,307 --> 00:41:29,976
My presence in this timeline
has been anticipated.

240
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:34,564
T-X is designed to terminate
other cybernetic organisms.

241
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:39,861
So she's an anti-Terminator
Terminator?

242
00:41:41,238 --> 00:41:42,906
You've gotta be shitting me.

243
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:46,535
No, l am not shitting you.

244
00:42:01,842 --> 00:42:06,012
When ruptured,
the fuel cells become unstable.

245
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:07,806
Relax.

246
00:42:07,973 --> 00:42:11,476
-Let me out of here!
-Relax!

247
00:42:32,455 --> 00:42:33,915
Man, this is wack.

248
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:37,294
lt's been like this for hours.
Every goddamn station.

249
00:42:59,065 --> 00:43:00,608
Hey.

250
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:03,653
Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

251
00:43:07,866 --> 00:43:09,743
Talk to the hand.

252
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:28,970
Help! Help me!

253
00:43:29,471 --> 00:43:31,139
Help!

254
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:36,936
l think we better go.

255
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,595
Jerky?

256
00:44:11,471 --> 00:44:13,723
You're kidnapping me.

257
00:44:14,682 --> 00:44:17,060
-Look--
-God, you were always a delinquent.

258
00:44:17,227 --> 00:44:21,147
And look at you now, sitting there
like the bad-boy thing still works.

259
00:44:21,314 --> 00:44:24,192
What are you,
some kind of gang member?

260
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,736
How do you live with yourself?

261
00:44:28,988 --> 00:44:30,573
What?

262
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:36,621
Tell her who l am.

263
00:44:36,788 --> 00:44:39,457
John Connor is leader
of the Worldwide Resistance...

264
00:44:39,624 --> 00:44:42,502
...and last hope of humankind.

265
00:44:44,045 --> 00:44:46,464
Right. And him?

266
00:44:47,465 --> 00:44:49,884
He's a robot from the future.

267
00:44:50,051 --> 00:44:53,721
Living tissue over a metal skeleton,
sent back in time to protect me.

268
00:44:53,888 --> 00:44:55,682
Go to hell.

269
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:59,018
He doesn't mean you any harm.

270
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:02,313
l have a fiancé.

271
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,649
He's gonna be looking for me.

272
00:45:04,816 --> 00:45:07,235
What is it that you want?

273
00:45:09,028 --> 00:45:10,530
Just...

274
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:13,116
...imagine...

275
00:45:14,576 --> 00:45:18,746
...if you knew you were gonna do
something important with your life.

276
00:45:18,913 --> 00:45:21,207
Something amazing.

277
00:45:21,624 --> 00:45:25,253
Maybe the most important thing
anyone has ever done.

278
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:27,505
But there's a catch.

279
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:31,134
Something terrible has to happen.

280
00:45:35,555 --> 00:45:37,974
You couldn't...

281
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:42,312
...live with yourself if you didn't try
to stop it, but....

282
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:44,147
What are you talking about?

283
00:45:46,691 --> 00:45:49,986
lt's just-- The life you know...

284
00:45:50,278 --> 00:45:53,239
...all the stuff that
you take for granted...

285
00:45:54,324 --> 00:45:55,950
...it's not gonna last.

286
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:03,791
Mike Kripke.

287
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:07,629
Back there, why did you say
'' Kripke's basement''?

288
00:46:07,795 --> 00:46:09,380
Because Mike Kripke's house...

289
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:12,884
...that's where the kids used
to go make out, right?

290
00:46:17,263 --> 00:46:20,433
So you and me--
Wait, did we...?

291
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:24,270
Holy shit, we did.

292
00:46:24,437 --> 00:46:29,108
We made out in Kripke's basement.
l cannot believe you remembered that.

293
00:46:30,193 --> 00:46:34,489
l must have made
some kind of impression.

294
00:46:34,655 --> 00:46:36,032
Give me a break.

295
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:39,744
l only remembered because
the next day you were in the news.

296
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:49,962
Wait a second. You and me hooked up
the day before l first met him.

297
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:54,133
And now again, 10 years later.

298
00:46:55,885 --> 00:46:58,513
We were supposed to meet.

299
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,766
Coincidence.

300
00:47:06,813 --> 00:47:08,481
Yeah.

301
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:36,884
Hon? Did you just get in?

302
00:47:56,112 --> 00:47:59,407
Hi, l'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D.
This is Detective Bell.

303
00:48:00,116 --> 00:48:02,743
We're looking for Katherine Brewster.
ls she here?

304
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,120
No.

305
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:08,666
-You're her fiancé, Scott Mason?
-Yes.

306
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:12,712
There was an incident at the
veterinary hospital where she works.

307
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:15,590
We're concerned something
may have happened to her.

308
00:48:15,756 --> 00:48:16,924
Where is she?

309
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:20,553
We got a report from a gas station
attendant near Victorville...

310
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,640
...about a possible kidnapping
and it might be related.

311
00:48:24,807 --> 00:48:27,101
l'll help you find her.

312
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:40,823
Come with me.

313
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:46,871
Go.

314
00:49:14,857 --> 00:49:16,484
Your mother?

315
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:21,947
l never even knew
where she was buried.

316
00:49:24,867 --> 00:49:27,745
l hit the road the day she died.

317
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:33,876
Why did you bring me here?

318
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,340
No! What are you doing?

319
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:41,050
Hey, stop!

320
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:42,593
Get away from it! Stop!

321
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:52,853
Sarah Connor was cremated
in Mexico.

322
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,314
Her friends scattered her ashes
in the sea.

323
00:49:55,689 --> 00:49:58,901
They stored these weapons
in accordance with her will.

324
00:50:00,403 --> 00:50:01,904
What happened to her?

325
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:05,408
Leukaemia.

326
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:10,204
l'm sorry.

327
00:50:11,872 --> 00:50:15,376
We were living in Baja
when she was diagnosed.

328
00:50:17,044 --> 00:50:19,755
They only gave her six months.

329
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:23,801
But she fought for three years.

330
00:50:26,303 --> 00:50:28,514
Long enough to make sure.

331
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:32,560
To make sure?

332
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:37,523
That the world didn't end.

333
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:45,823
'' Every day after this one is a gift.''

334
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,868
She told me, ''We made it. We're free.''

335
00:50:51,704 --> 00:50:54,331
But l never really believed that.

336
00:50:57,376 --> 00:50:59,795
l guess she didn't either.

337
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:05,301
You know you were about the closest
thing to a father l ever had?

338
00:51:06,468 --> 00:51:08,262
How pathetic is that?

339
00:51:09,805 --> 00:51:11,015
Out of my way!

340
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:16,395
My mission is to protect you.

341
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:18,522
That's enough.

342
00:51:20,149 --> 00:51:23,569
Move or l'll do it!
l swear l will! l'll shoot you!

343
00:51:24,445 --> 00:51:26,906
Go ahead. See what happens.

344
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,339
Don't do that.

345
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:47,468
Oh, my God.

346
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:56,936
This is the police.
We have the building surrounded.

347
00:51:57,102 --> 00:51:59,271
Release your hostage!

348
00:52:18,165 --> 00:52:21,919
Just leave me here. l'm not the one
you want. You're wasting your time.

349
00:52:22,086 --> 00:52:26,173
lncorrect. John Connor
leads the Resistance to victory.

350
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,591
How?

351
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:29,385
Why? Why me?

352
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:31,762
You are John Connor.

353
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:36,433
Christ, my mom fed me that bullshit
since the cradle.

354
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:39,520
Look at me.
l'm no leader, l never was!

355
00:52:39,687 --> 00:52:41,772
l'm never gonna--

356
00:52:45,776 --> 00:52:47,236
Let go.

357
00:52:47,653 --> 00:52:50,531
You're right.
You're not the one l want.

358
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:53,075
l'm wasting my time.

359
00:52:54,993 --> 00:52:59,456
Fuck you, you fucking machine!

360
00:53:00,249 --> 00:53:01,792
Better.

361
00:53:04,002 --> 00:53:06,088
Oh, you were just dicking with me?

362
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:08,966
Anger is more useful than despair.

363
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:10,717
What?

364
00:53:10,884 --> 00:53:14,346
Basic psychology is among
my subroutines.

365
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,686
Perps still holed up?

366
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:22,896
Gotcha.

367
00:53:23,063 --> 00:53:25,607
Good news. Your fiancée's okay.

368
00:53:25,774 --> 00:53:26,859
Where is she?

369
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:29,528
Greenlawn Cemetery,
up off the 5 freeway.

370
00:53:29,736 --> 00:53:33,657
lt's right by the desert. But they're
gonna bring her back to the--

371
00:53:34,616 --> 00:53:37,119
Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

372
00:54:07,482 --> 00:54:10,944
You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

373
00:54:11,486 --> 00:54:14,656
Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

374
00:54:14,823 --> 00:54:18,160
l'm a post-trauma counsellor
for the sheriff's department.

375
00:54:18,327 --> 00:54:20,370
How are you feeling?

376
00:54:21,163 --> 00:54:23,165
He's not human.

377
00:54:23,498 --> 00:54:27,669
He's really not human.

378
00:54:30,088 --> 00:54:33,550
l know what it's like to be
in a hostage situation.

379
00:54:33,717 --> 00:54:35,802
l've been there myself.

380
00:54:35,969 --> 00:54:39,097
The fear, the adrenaline.

381
00:54:39,264 --> 00:54:43,185
You find yourself imagining things.

382
00:54:43,685 --> 00:54:46,271
lmpossible things.

383
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,191
Crazy things.

384
00:54:50,442 --> 00:54:52,694
lnsane things.

385
00:54:54,655 --> 00:54:57,532
Take years to get over it.

386
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:01,203
-Go, go, go!
-Move it!

387
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:08,168
Drop your weapon!

388
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:13,966
And the coffin!

389
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:18,804
Take him down! Take him down!

390
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,763
Resume fire!

391
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:11,231
We must reacquire
Katherine Brewster.

392
00:56:11,982 --> 00:56:14,943
Why? What makes her
so goddamn important?

393
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,946
Through her, you contact remnants
of the military...

394
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:22,117
...and learn how to fight Skynet,
forming the core of the Resistance.

395
00:56:22,284 --> 00:56:24,911
Later,
your children will become important.

396
00:56:25,787 --> 00:56:28,832
-What?
-She's your wife.

397
00:57:27,682 --> 00:57:29,392
Get in!

398
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:31,102
Do you want to live? Come on!

399
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:56,836
-lt was Scott! How could it be Scott?
-Your fiancé?

400
00:57:57,003 --> 00:58:01,007
The T-X is polymimetic, able to take
the form of anything it touches.

401
00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:03,843
Your fiancé is dead.

402
00:58:28,368 --> 00:58:29,411
Oh, my God!

403
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:36,251
Do something!

404
00:59:07,282 --> 00:59:08,950
Get down.

405
00:59:31,473 --> 00:59:33,725
We need a new vehicle.

406
01:00:56,641 --> 01:00:58,184
Hey, come on.

407
01:00:58,351 --> 01:01:00,478
We gotta keep moving.

408
01:01:02,647 --> 01:01:05,233
She killed Scott because of me.

409
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:14,284
Look, l know this won't help...

410
01:01:16,494 --> 01:01:22,083
...but sometimes things happen
that we just can't change.

411
01:01:26,045 --> 01:01:27,588
lt's not your fault.

412
01:01:43,021 --> 01:01:45,273
Are you sure about this?

413
01:01:46,065 --> 01:01:47,525
About her and me, l mean.

414
01:01:47,692 --> 01:01:52,321
Your confusion is not rational. She's
a healthy female of breeding age.

415
01:01:52,488 --> 01:01:54,365
There's more to it than that.

416
01:01:54,532 --> 01:01:59,245
My database does not encompass
the dynamics of human pair bonding.

417
01:02:02,623 --> 01:02:06,377
So this Terminatrix, how many others
does she have on her hit list?

418
01:02:06,794 --> 01:02:11,466
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth.
Anderson, William.

419
01:02:11,632 --> 01:02:14,385
Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

420
01:02:14,552 --> 01:02:15,803
My father?

421
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:18,639
Having failed to acquire
its primary target...

422
01:02:18,806 --> 01:02:21,017
...T-X will resume its default program.

423
01:02:21,184 --> 01:02:25,271
-She's gonna kill my father too?
-There's a high probability.

424
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,357
-No.
-Who is he? What does he do?

425
01:02:28,524 --> 01:02:33,029
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design,
secret stuff. l don't know, exactly.

426
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:36,991
General Robert Brewster
is program director of CRS...

427
01:02:37,158 --> 01:02:41,078
...Cyber Research Systems,
autonomous weapons division.

428
01:02:41,245 --> 01:02:44,165
Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

429
01:02:44,332 --> 01:02:48,628
Skynet is one of the digital defence
systems developed under Brewster.

430
01:02:48,795 --> 01:02:50,296
Oh, God.

431
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:53,925
Oh, my God. Of course.

432
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,760
lt all makes sense now.

433
01:02:56,636 --> 01:03:00,014
lf you hadn't come back when
l was a kid, changed everything...

434
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:04,310
...we would have gotten together
then. l would have met her father.

435
01:03:04,685 --> 01:03:07,104
-Don't you see?
-l don't understand.

436
01:03:07,271 --> 01:03:11,192
Your father.
This is all about your father.

437
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,027
He's the key. He always was.

438
01:03:13,194 --> 01:03:15,988
Your father is the one
who can shut Skynet down.

439
01:03:17,365 --> 01:03:19,867
He's the only one who ever could.

440
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:23,913
We have to get to him
before the T-X does.

441
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,499
Negative. l cannot jeopardize
my mission.

442
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:28,626
This is your mission,
to save people!

443
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:32,713
My mission is to ensure the survival of
John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

444
01:03:33,506 --> 01:03:35,800
l am giving you an order.

445
01:03:35,967 --> 01:03:38,553
l am not programmed
to follow your orders.

446
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:41,806
-After the nuclear war, you both--
-Nuclear war?!

447
01:03:41,973 --> 01:03:45,059
There doesn't have to be a war!
We can stop it!

448
01:03:45,226 --> 01:03:47,395
There is insufficient time.

449
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:51,732
The first launch sequences
will be initiated at 6: 18 p.m.

450
01:03:51,899 --> 01:03:53,693
-What, today?
-Affirmative.

451
01:03:53,859 --> 01:03:56,571
John, what is he saying?

452
01:03:57,697 --> 01:03:59,699
Judgment Day.

453
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:03,244
The end of the world.

454
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,580
lt's today, three hours from now.

455
01:04:07,081 --> 01:04:09,083
Two hours and 53 minutes.

456
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:14,338
We must continue south into Mexico
to escape the primary blast zones.

457
01:04:15,089 --> 01:04:17,883
No, we have to get to her dad.

458
01:04:19,552 --> 01:04:23,431
The Mojave area will sustain
significant nuclear fallout.

459
01:04:23,597 --> 01:04:25,266
You will not survive.

460
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:30,438
You mean we go hide somewhere
in a hole while the bombs fall?

461
01:04:31,272 --> 01:04:32,732
lt is your destiny.

462
01:04:36,444 --> 01:04:38,237
-Fuck my destiny.
-John.

463
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,036
You cannot self-terminate.

464
01:04:45,578 --> 01:04:47,997
No, you can't.
l can do whatever l want.

465
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:50,958
l'm a human being.
l'm not some goddamn robot.

466
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,960
-Cybernetic organism.
-Whatever!

467
01:04:53,127 --> 01:04:55,963
Either we get her father
to shut Skynet down...

468
01:04:56,130 --> 01:05:00,885
...stop this shit from ever happening,
or so much for the great John Connor.

469
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:06,057
Because your future, my destiny,
l don't want any part of it. l never did.

470
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,437
Based on your pupil dilation, skin
temperature and motor functions...

471
01:05:12,021 --> 01:05:17,818
...l calculate an 83% probability
that you will not pull the trigger.

472
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:26,327
Please do what he says.
You have to save my father!

473
01:05:30,498 --> 01:05:34,043
We can reach CRS
in approximately one hour...

474
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:37,004
...depending on traffic conditions.

475
01:06:01,362 --> 01:06:03,030
l can't get a line.

476
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:07,910
The whole cell network is down.

477
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:11,038
Skynet is assuming control
over global communications...

478
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:13,541
...in preparation for its attack.

479
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:17,878
So if this war is between people
and machines...

480
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:20,381
...why are you on our side?

481
01:06:20,548 --> 01:06:24,510
The Resistance captured me
and reprogrammed my CPU.

482
01:06:24,677 --> 01:06:28,180
l was originally designed
for assassination missions.

483
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,643
So...

484
01:06:32,977 --> 01:06:36,855
...you don't really care
if this mission succeeds or not.

485
01:06:37,398 --> 01:06:41,402
lf we get killed,
does that mean anything to you?

486
01:06:41,569 --> 01:06:44,822
lf you were to die,
l will become useless.

487
01:06:44,989 --> 01:06:48,117
There will be no reason for me to exist.

488
01:06:53,747 --> 01:06:55,833
Thank you for doing this.

489
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,002
Your gratitude is not required.

490
01:06:58,711 --> 01:07:01,088
l am programmed
to follow your commands.

491
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:03,507
Her commands?

492
01:07:03,674 --> 01:07:06,468
Katherine Brewster had
me reactivated...

493
01:07:06,635 --> 01:07:09,054
...and sent through
the time displacement field.

494
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:12,850
What exactly am l in this
future of yours?

495
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:16,729
You're John Connor's spouse
and second-in-command.

496
01:07:18,689 --> 01:07:20,566
No, l--

497
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:22,526
What?

498
01:07:24,737 --> 01:07:26,363
You're a mess.

499
01:07:27,948 --> 01:07:31,785
Hey, you're not
exactly my type, either.

500
01:07:32,745 --> 01:07:34,788
Why didn't l send you back?

501
01:07:34,955 --> 01:07:37,249
l am not authorized
to answer your question.

502
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:42,504
-Why didn't he send you back?
-He was dead.

503
01:07:47,092 --> 01:07:48,802
Well, that sucks.

504
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,640
-Humans inevitably die.
-Yeah, l know.

505
01:07:54,516 --> 01:07:56,643
So how does it--? No.

506
01:07:57,102 --> 01:07:59,897
Maybe l don't want to know.

507
01:08:01,482 --> 01:08:02,983
How does he die?

508
01:08:03,692 --> 01:08:07,488
John Connor was terminated
on July 4th, 2032.

509
01:08:07,654 --> 01:08:11,533
l was selected for the emotional
attachment he had for my model...

510
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,996
...due to his boyhood experiences.
This aided in my infiltration.

511
01:08:16,955 --> 01:08:18,582
What are you saying?

512
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:22,669
l killed you.

513
01:08:34,973 --> 01:08:39,978
This has to be a mistake. As of 1100,
all military systems were secure.

514
01:08:40,145 --> 01:08:44,191
They were. Only the civilian sector
was affected. lnternet, air traffic.

515
01:08:44,358 --> 01:08:47,194
Minutes ago, guidance computers
at Vandenberg crashed.

516
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:50,030
We thought it was an error.
lt looks like the virus.

517
01:08:50,197 --> 01:08:54,493
-Early warning in Alaska is down.
-Satellite signals are scrambled.

518
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,538
What about the missile silos,
the subs?

519
01:08:58,539 --> 01:09:00,749
We've lost contact.

520
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:04,670
You're saying this country
is completely open to attack.

521
01:09:04,837 --> 01:09:07,673
Theoretically, we could be
under attack already.

522
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:13,262
Who's doing this? A foreign power or
some computer hacker in his garage?

523
01:09:13,428 --> 01:09:15,556
We can't trace the virus
or pin it down.

524
01:09:15,722 --> 01:09:19,893
lt keeps growing and changing,
like it has a mind of its own.

525
01:09:20,394 --> 01:09:22,187
This can't be happening.

526
01:09:22,354 --> 01:09:26,567
The Pentagon's on the secure line.
lt's the chairman.

527
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,738
All right.

528
01:09:46,169 --> 01:09:48,088
Look...

529
01:09:48,422 --> 01:09:50,382
...none of this is gonna happen.

530
01:09:51,008 --> 01:09:56,430
We get to your dad, get him to pull the
plug on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

531
01:09:58,765 --> 01:10:01,602
He won't have to kill me someday.

532
01:10:02,394 --> 01:10:04,730
He'll never even exist.

533
01:10:06,398 --> 01:10:11,737
You and l, we can
just go our separate ways.

534
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:18,994
You know, Mike Kripke's basement....

535
01:10:21,788 --> 01:10:24,708
That was the first time
l ever kissed a guy.

536
01:10:25,959 --> 01:10:27,252
Really?

537
01:10:34,509 --> 01:10:36,637
Your levity is good.

538
01:10:37,304 --> 01:10:40,807
lt relieves tension
and the fear of death.

539
01:11:07,918 --> 01:11:10,545
We're hoping you have
a solution for us.

540
01:11:10,712 --> 01:11:14,508
l know, sir, but Skynet is not ready
for a system-wide connection.

541
01:11:14,674 --> 01:11:17,636
That's not what your civilian
counterparts there told me.

542
01:11:17,803 --> 01:11:20,097
They say we can stop
this damn virus.

543
01:11:20,263 --> 01:11:23,767
I understand there's a certain amount
of performance anxiety...

544
01:11:23,934 --> 01:11:27,270
...but your boys say if we plug Skynet
into all of our systems...

545
01:11:27,437 --> 01:11:31,525
... it'll squash this thing and give me
back control of my military.

546
01:11:31,691 --> 01:11:34,194
Mr. Chairman, l need
to make myself very clear.

547
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:37,781
lf we uplink now, Skynet will be
in control of your military.

548
01:11:37,948 --> 01:11:41,993
But you'll be in control
of Skynet, right?

549
01:11:42,327 --> 01:11:44,454
That is correct, sir.

550
01:11:44,621 --> 01:11:45,997
Then do it.

551
01:11:46,164 --> 01:11:48,917
And, Brewster, if this thing works...

552
01:11:49,084 --> 01:11:52,462
...you'll get all the funding
you'll ever need.

553
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,340
Yes, sir.

554
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:05,577
Sir?

555
01:13:06,786 --> 01:13:08,580
Shall l?

556
01:13:10,123 --> 01:13:11,666
No.

557
01:13:12,792 --> 01:13:14,961
lt's my job now.

558
01:13:29,476 --> 01:13:32,479
-Skynet Defence System activated.
-We're in.

559
01:13:32,646 --> 01:13:35,899
We're past the firewalls, local
defence nets, Minutemen, subs.

560
01:13:36,066 --> 01:13:40,195
Skynet's fully operational,
processing at 60 teraflops a second.

561
01:13:40,362 --> 01:13:44,240
lt should take less than a minute
to find the virus and kill it.

562
01:13:45,325 --> 01:13:48,203
Let's pray to God this works.

563
01:13:54,459 --> 01:13:55,627
Power failure?

564
01:13:55,794 --> 01:13:58,129
No. l don't know what it is.

565
01:14:09,182 --> 01:14:11,601
What the hell is going on?

566
01:14:11,768 --> 01:14:12,811
Daddy!

567
01:14:13,353 --> 01:14:14,896
What are you doing here?

568
01:14:21,236 --> 01:14:24,030
Daddy! Get away from it!

569
01:14:27,867 --> 01:14:29,369
Watch out!

570
01:14:46,636 --> 01:14:48,555
Daddy, don't move.

571
01:14:52,892 --> 01:14:54,644
She'll be back.

572
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,272
We have to shut down Skynet.

573
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:00,066
Where's the system core?
ln this building?

574
01:15:00,233 --> 01:15:04,070
Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

575
01:15:04,237 --> 01:15:07,365
Skynet is the virus!
lt's why everything's falling apart!

576
01:15:07,532 --> 01:15:09,659
Skynet has become self-aware.

577
01:15:09,826 --> 01:15:13,454
ln one hour it will initiate
a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

578
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:14,747
What enemy?

579
01:15:15,331 --> 01:15:16,749
Us!

580
01:15:16,916 --> 01:15:18,251
Humans.

581
01:15:27,343 --> 01:15:30,597
Oh, God! lt's the machines.
They're starting to take over.

582
01:15:30,763 --> 01:15:34,267
My office, on this floor,
we have to get there.

583
01:15:35,435 --> 01:15:37,687
The access codes are in my safe.

584
01:16:56,474 --> 01:17:00,561
-Why are they killing everyone?
-To destroy any threat to Skynet.

585
01:17:00,728 --> 01:17:02,522
Which ones are the codes?

586
01:17:02,689 --> 01:17:04,524
Red envelope.

587
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:12,156
Crystal Peak. You have
to get to Crystal Peak.

588
01:17:12,323 --> 01:17:14,492
-What is he saying?
-Crystal Peak.

589
01:17:14,659 --> 01:17:17,328
A hardened facility
in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

590
01:17:17,495 --> 01:17:21,249
Fifty-two miles northeast,
bearing 0.5 degrees.

591
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:23,126
That's the system core?

592
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:25,837
lt's your only chance.

593
01:17:26,003 --> 01:17:30,967
You'll need a plane. The particle
accelerator leads to the runway.

594
01:17:32,969 --> 01:17:34,720
Take care of my daughter.

595
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:40,560
Oh, Katie, l am sorry.

596
01:17:40,726 --> 01:17:44,021
l opened Pandora's box.

597
01:17:45,148 --> 01:17:46,190
Get down!

598
01:18:02,582 --> 01:18:04,959
There's nothing you can do. Come on.

599
01:18:05,126 --> 01:18:07,253
We must go. lt is not safe here.

600
01:18:08,004 --> 01:18:10,465
Kate, we have to go.

601
01:18:10,631 --> 01:18:14,343
Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

602
01:18:14,594 --> 01:18:18,723
He wanted us to shut Skynet down.
Come on.

603
01:18:20,475 --> 01:18:21,934
Come on.

604
01:18:33,905 --> 01:18:35,531
Run!

605
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:11,752
Let's go.

606
01:21:23,115 --> 01:21:25,993
That's it. We can follow it
out to the runway.

607
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,912
Come on.

608
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,803
What?

609
01:22:27,096 --> 01:22:28,847
Nothing.

610
01:22:29,848 --> 01:22:32,059
You remind me of my mother.

611
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:51,870
Oh, God. She's coming.

612
01:22:55,457 --> 01:22:57,334
What are you doing?

613
01:22:58,377 --> 01:22:59,461
Powering up.

614
01:23:04,633 --> 01:23:05,759
Come on.

615
01:24:16,371 --> 01:24:17,748
lt's working.

616
01:24:22,377 --> 01:24:24,963
Just die, you bitch!

617
01:24:28,675 --> 01:24:30,427
Come on.

618
01:25:46,586 --> 01:25:49,423
There's my father's plane.
l trained on it.

619
01:26:00,434 --> 01:26:02,686
Yes! He made it.

620
01:26:04,646 --> 01:26:06,648
Get away from me.

621
01:26:09,109 --> 01:26:10,152
Leave!

622
01:26:11,903 --> 01:26:13,030
Now!

623
01:26:13,447 --> 01:26:14,656
Let's go!

624
01:26:19,578 --> 01:26:22,706
-The master's on. Throttle's set.
-Come on. Let's go.

625
01:26:28,712 --> 01:26:31,757
Oh, please. You can't do this.

626
01:26:31,923 --> 01:26:33,550
l have no choice.

627
01:26:34,426 --> 01:26:36,803
The T-X...

628
01:26:37,095 --> 01:26:39,431
...has corrupted my system.

629
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:46,146
You can't kill a human being.
You said so yourself.

630
01:26:46,313 --> 01:26:48,148
Let him go!

631
01:26:52,819 --> 01:26:54,613
You're fighting it right now.

632
01:26:55,489 --> 01:26:57,616
My CPU is intact.

633
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:01,953
But l cannot control
my other functions.

634
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:05,791
You don't have to do this.
You don't want to do this!

635
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:10,295
Desire is irrelevant.

636
01:27:10,462 --> 01:27:13,048
l am a machine.

637
01:27:29,648 --> 01:27:31,316
What is your mission?

638
01:27:33,026 --> 01:27:36,613
To ensure the survival
of John Connor...

639
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,824
...and Katherine Brewster.

640
01:27:44,162 --> 01:27:47,332
You are about to fail that mission!

641
01:27:54,214 --> 01:27:57,008
l can-- l cannot.

642
01:27:58,134 --> 01:28:00,262
You know what you have to do.

643
01:28:02,222 --> 01:28:04,808
You know my destiny.

644
01:28:09,437 --> 01:28:10,605
l have to live.

645
01:28:51,313 --> 01:28:53,857
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

646
01:28:54,024 --> 01:28:56,651
He couldn't do it.
He shut himself down.

647
01:29:00,405 --> 01:29:02,991
-Can you fly?
-Yeah.

648
01:29:30,393 --> 01:29:32,604
Okay. 015 degrees...

649
01:29:32,771 --> 01:29:36,983
...52 miles, our max air speed
is about 160.

650
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:39,569
We've got 32 minutes.

651
01:29:39,736 --> 01:29:41,571
lt's just you and me now.

652
01:29:41,738 --> 01:29:44,199
What if we can't stop it?

653
01:29:44,783 --> 01:29:48,453
There's enough C-4 here
to take out 10 supercomputers.

654
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:51,206
We're gonna make it, Kate.

655
01:29:52,415 --> 01:29:54,793
The future is up to us.

656
01:30:01,216 --> 01:30:03,468
That's gotta be it.

657
01:31:06,614 --> 01:31:09,701
Skynet. There may be more of them.

658
01:31:27,552 --> 01:31:29,387
Come on.

659
01:31:43,568 --> 01:31:46,779
l think this is some kind of blast door.

660
01:31:49,907 --> 01:31:52,577
There's no way
we can blow through this thing.

661
01:31:53,786 --> 01:31:54,829
John, look.

662
01:31:57,790 --> 01:31:59,250
Now what?

663
01:32:02,086 --> 01:32:04,422
lt's a code prompt.

664
01:32:11,554 --> 01:32:14,599
Type in '' Dakota 775.''

665
01:32:19,771 --> 01:32:21,105
'' Red 176.''

666
01:32:42,126 --> 01:32:44,462
Come on!
We gotta get this thing open.

667
01:32:44,712 --> 01:32:46,547
Here. lt's ''Avalon 412.''

668
01:32:47,465 --> 01:32:48,800
Put it in!

669
01:33:23,167 --> 01:33:24,585
Come on!

670
01:33:41,102 --> 01:33:42,603
l'm back.

671
01:33:58,035 --> 01:34:00,204
Go! Now!

672
01:34:00,746 --> 01:34:01,789
Come on!

673
01:34:24,895 --> 01:34:27,231
-Thank you.
-We'll meet again.

674
01:34:27,481 --> 01:34:28,649
Go!

675
01:34:29,775 --> 01:34:30,818
Come on!

676
01:35:15,404 --> 01:35:16,947
You are terminated.

677
01:35:49,146 --> 01:35:50,481
The elevator.

678
01:35:57,071 --> 01:35:59,490
l'll set the detonator for five minutes.

679
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:02,410
That should give us enough time
to get back up.

680
01:36:33,774 --> 01:36:35,526
What is this place?

681
01:37:16,233 --> 01:37:18,736
These computers are 30 years old.

682
01:37:27,244 --> 01:37:29,079
This isn't Skynet.

683
01:37:33,751 --> 01:37:35,586
There's nothing here.

684
01:37:40,758 --> 01:37:43,594
This is a fallout shelter for VlPs.

685
01:37:45,429 --> 01:37:47,765
Only they never got the warning.

686
01:37:52,436 --> 01:37:54,104
Goddamn it!

687
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:58,942
There's nothing here!

688
01:38:18,462 --> 01:38:20,297
Why didn't he tell us?

689
01:38:23,634 --> 01:38:26,053
Why did he lead us down here?

690
01:38:31,809 --> 01:38:33,477
To live.

691
01:38:34,645 --> 01:38:36,647
That was his mission.

692
01:38:50,494 --> 01:38:52,663
There was never any stopping it.

693
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:57,668
John...

694
01:38:59,002 --> 01:39:00,671
...we could just...

695
01:39:01,505 --> 01:39:02,840
...let it go.

696
01:39:05,676 --> 01:39:07,010
Hello?

697
01:39:07,803 --> 01:39:10,013
Hello? Can somebody hear me?

698
01:39:11,098 --> 01:39:12,933
This is Montana Civil Defence.

699
01:39:14,518 --> 01:39:16,687
Somebody please come in.

700
01:39:17,187 --> 01:39:18,856
Is there anybody there?

701
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:22,192
Anyone reading me? Over.

702
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,195
Rumours about a launch sequence.

703
01:39:25,362 --> 01:39:27,614
Command and control
have broken down.

704
01:39:28,866 --> 01:39:31,952
Is anyone receiving me?
Somebody?

705
01:39:34,037 --> 01:39:36,039
Somebody please come in.

706
01:39:36,456 --> 01:39:37,791
Anybody out there?

707
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:41,378
-SAC Nellis. We're under attack.
-CQ? CQ?

708
01:39:41,628 --> 01:39:43,213
Is anybody there?

709
01:39:45,215 --> 01:39:48,886
This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

710
01:39:49,803 --> 01:39:54,558
Connor? What the hell is happening?
Who's in charge there?

711
01:40:01,398 --> 01:40:02,733
l am.

712
01:40:04,067 --> 01:40:06,403
Connor, can you help us?

713
01:40:06,737 --> 01:40:11,575
This is Montana Civil Defence.
Where did you say you were again?

714
01:40:14,912 --> 01:40:17,748
By the time Skynet
became self-aware...

715
01:40:18,081 --> 01:40:22,419
... it had spread into millions of
computer servers across the planet.

716
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:28,091
Ordinary computers in office
buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere.

717
01:40:29,927 --> 01:40:33,597
It was software in cyberspace.

718
01:40:34,765 --> 01:40:39,603
There was no system core.
It could not be shut down.

719
01:40:40,938 --> 01:40:45,943
The attack began at 6:18 p.m.,
just as he said it would.

720
01:40:46,944 --> 01:40:48,612
Judgment Day.

721
01:40:49,446 --> 01:40:51,949
The day the human race
was nearly destroyed...

722
01:40:52,115 --> 01:40:54,868
...by weapons they'd built
to protect themselves.

723
01:40:57,454 --> 01:41:02,459
I should have realized our destiny
was never to stop Judgment Day.

724
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:05,963
It was merely to survive it...

725
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:08,757
... together.

726
01:41:12,135 --> 01:41:13,970
The Terminator knew.

727
01:41:14,471 --> 01:41:16,973
He tried to tell us...

728
01:41:17,808 --> 01:41:20,477
...but I didn't want to hear it.

729
01:41:22,813 --> 01:41:26,817
Maybe the future has been written.
I don't know.

730
01:41:27,818 --> 01:41:30,487
All I know is what
the Terminator taught me..

731
01:41:31,154 --> 01:41:33,490
Never stop fighting.

732
01:41:33,657 --> 01:41:36,326
And I never will.

733
01:41:38,328 --> 01:41:42,290
The battle has just begun.

734
01:41:47,337 --> 01:41:57,764
