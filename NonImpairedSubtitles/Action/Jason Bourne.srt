He could see the threats
that America was facing,

There is an argument for catching Bourne

Bourne's been off the grid for a long time.

He's been hiding in the shadows,

Albert Hirsch wrote a psych evaluation
when Bourne left the program.

540
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:03,613
He concluded Bourne is still a patriot at heart,

541
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:07,077
and that leaving the program
could come back to haunt him.

Desperately looking into his past.

545
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:19,588
And I think he's at a tipping point.

I think I can bring him back in.

I think it would be inappropriate
to pass any comment at this stage,

01:48:25,964 --> 01:48:27,884
but I look forward to
working with the authorities

Dewey's problem was
that he belonged in the past.

You can pull over here.

Of course, if you decide
that you don't need me,

1211
01:51:11,296 --> 01:51:12,376
then that's not a problem.
