1
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:09,809
What do you want?

2
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:11,845
Beer.

3
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:14,404
All I got is piss-warm Chango.

4
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:16,814
That's my brand.

5
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,736
This is good.

6
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,866
This is the best beer I've ever had.

7
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,672
Actually...

8
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:46,179
Need anything?

9
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:48,772
I'm just glad to be alive.

10
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:52,781
I was up a few towns away.
You know Saragosa?

11
00:01:52,854 --> 00:01:56,346
I was visiting a bar there like this.
They serve beer.

12
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:58,415
Not this good, but close.

13
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:02,861
I saw something you wouldn't believe.

14
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:06,290
I'm sitting there by myself.

15
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:10,804
Now, this bar
was full of real lowlifes.

16
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,241
Not like this place.

17
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,610
No, I mean bad.
Like they were up to no good.

18
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:24,949
Anyway, I'm by myself.
I like it that way.

19
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,920
Meanwhile, things are going on.

20
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:31,356
Under-the-table kinds of things.
Not too obvious...

21
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:34,418
but not too secret either.

22
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:39,490
So I'm sitting there...

23
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,831
and in walks...

24
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:48,501
the biggest Mexican I have ever seen,
big as shit.

25
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:50,601
Walks in like he owns the place.

26
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:53,511
Nobody knew what to make of him
or what to think.

27
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:56,516
There he was, and in he walked.

28
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,319
He was dark, too.

29
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,989
I don't mean dark-skinned.

30
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,456
This was different.

31
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:07,289
It was as if he was always walking
in a shadow.

32
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:12,492
Every step he took toward the light,
when you thought you'd see his face...

33
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,194
it wasn't.

34
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:17,795
It was as if the lights dimmed
just for him.

35
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:28,808
So, this guy...

36
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,485
takes a seat at the bar...

37
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:34,714
asks the bartender for a soda,
says nothing.

38
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,313
He ordered a soda?

39
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,450
I wasn't interested in his drink.

40
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:41,654
I was more interested
in what he was carrying...

41
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,132
when he walked in,
some sort of a suitcase, heavy.

42
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,135
He sat that thing beside him
as if it were his girl.

43
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:54,341
Then, all of a sudden,
the bastard spoke.

44
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:56,638
He talked low to the bartender.

45
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,941
I knew he was talking business
because it upset the bartender.

46
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:01,777
Especially when he mentioned...

47
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,817
He said something like...

48
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,047
"bitch" or "Bucho."

49
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:19,424
That's what it was.
Bucho.

50
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,033
Whatever he said
pissed off the bartender.

51
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:26,767
Some of those unsavory characters...

52
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:30,868
not class acts like these boys,
but real scum, got pissed too.

53
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:34,779
Started pulling guns and knives,
starting some shit.

54
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:36,680
The stranger...

55
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:42,212
he bolts out of his bar stool,
grabs his case and dives into the room.

56
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,090
I don't know what he does on the floor,
but in two shakes the suitcase opens...

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,426
and he's pulled out the biggest
hand cannon I've ever fucking seen.

58
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:13,553
That was just the beginning.

59
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:18,581
You stood there while this went down?
You didn't run for cover or join in?

60
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,150
I was frozen stiff.

61
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,527
All I could do was watch this...

62
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:29,599
thing tear the place apart.

63
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,467
It was amazing.

64
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,607
Cutthroat scumbags...

65
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:38,440
were coming out of the woodwork
and dying much-deserved deaths.

66
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,002
Don't get me wrong.

67
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:42,572
This was no class-act group
like you got here.

68
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,117
Not at all.

69
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:46,949
These guys were world-class turds.

70
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:49,956
I'm sorry,
but they got what they deserved.

71
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:51,753
It was Judgment Night.

72
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:57,430
He grabs one of these guys...

73
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:59,432
the only guy still breathing.

74
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,800
He starts getting information from him.
I knew by the whispering...

75
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:06,305
this guy was giving up
all the goods.

76
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:11,311
Spilling his guts. Confessing the world.
He told that stranger everything.

77
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:14,080
Everything?

78
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:23,488
Can I get a cleaner mug?
This one's dirty.

79
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,491
Fuck you!

80
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:30,062
It's the cleanest one I got.

81
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,497
So anyway...

82
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:43,839
without warning,
without any hint or preview...

83
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:46,004
the stranger whips around...

84
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,377
and he sees...

85
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,972
me.

86
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,075
You saw his face?

87
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:52,949
His face?

88
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,323
His eyes.

89
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:17,707
- He didn't do anything to you?
- Not really.

90
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:21,714
Because he turned his attention back
to the guy on the floor.

91
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:24,751
The stranger shot him...

92
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,387
walked to the bartender,
paid and left.

93
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:31,721
So the bartender lived?

94
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:38,898
The bartender never gets killed!

95
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:44,233
But as the stranger neared the door...

96
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:54,274
No, man, the bartender
got it worse than anybody.

97
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,916
Here. It's on the house...

98
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:06,688
if you can remember his face.

99
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:11,391
Thanks, but no thanks.
I'm clearing out of here, boys...

100
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:15,401
'cause I think he's headed this way.

101
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:18,767
Thank you!

102
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:22,769
You all take care.

103
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:11,500
Who is it?

104
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:13,972
It's your only friend.

105
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,375
Don't you think you're being
a little too cautious?

106
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:34,092
One day, you'll lay down too hard
on that and blow your brains out.

107
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,526
What do you want?

108
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:44,365
He's there.

109
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:50,101
I mentioned his name
and they freaked.

110
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:51,610
Bucho's there?

111
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,547
One second they weren't listening
to a word I said...

112
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:58,744
but as soon as I mentioned him,
they couldn't hear enough.

113
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:04,387
And suddenly they got very interested
in who you were.

114
00:13:06,193 --> 00:13:08,889
I laid the story down
nice and thick.

115
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:10,759
How thick?

116
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,298
Pretty thick.

117
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:16,234
- You were the biggest Mexican I'd seen.
- Wonderful.

118
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:18,396
I blew it out of proportion,
but they bought it.

119
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:21,134
They're shitting bricks.
I promise.

120
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,903
Where do I go?

121
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,947
Tarasco Bar's a start.

122
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,143
Try and keep it from turning into
a fucking bloodbath like last time.

123
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:33,277
That wasn't my fault.

124
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,618
- Of course not.
- They started it.

125
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,886
Whatever. Just remember,
Bucho's the one you want.

126
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,291
He's got plenty of underlings.
But without them, he's as good as dead.

127
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:47,394
- Save your bullets.
- Suddenly, you're my big brother.

128
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:51,199
I do feel some responsibility
for you.

129
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:55,599
- May I ask you something?
- Yeah.

130
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:58,270
What happens when he's dead?

131
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:02,682
When Bucho's dead...

132
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,511
it's over.

133
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,754
He's the last one.

134
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:16,956
End of payback? An eye for an eye
and all that crap? You'll be satisfied?

135
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:19,992
I think so.

136
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,830
I hope so.

137
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,606
I don't have the stomach
for this anymore.

138
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:32,710
You never did.

139
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,673
Neither did you.

140
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,578
I just called the Oro Verde Bar
in Saragosa.

141
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:21,480
There was no answer.

142
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:25,820
Let me know if you hear anything.

143
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:27,758
Okay. Bye.

144
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:33,391
I want a close lookout
on all operations.

145
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:37,563
That means double and triple checking,
even our regular customers.

146
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:39,606
I'll handle it.

147
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:42,972
Where is my car? Is it finished?
How long must I wait?

148
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:47,673
- I didn't like it so I sent it back.
- Again? I could've built it myself.

149
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:50,114
- What's this?
- It's my sister's nephew.

150
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:53,619
He's looking for work so he wanted
to show you his fighting abilities.

151
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:57,851
What? You call this an audition,
fighting against Pipon?

152
00:16:57,925 --> 00:17:02,362
If he can't beat Cristos,
I'm not interested. Cristos, get in.

153
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:03,919
Get out.

154
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:25,144
He doesn't look special.

155
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:29,488
Kick his ass, Cristos!

156
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:07,818
That's more like it.

157
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:13,997
He'll never dance again.

158
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,113
- So much for Cristos.
- Told you.

159
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,741
Yeah, yeah. Listen.
This is what I want you to do.

160
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:34,116
Place extra men around
the Tarasco Bar and La Asteca.

161
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:37,247
These Colombians are wondering
if I can handle the extra volume.

162
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,724
They're watching us enough as it is.

163
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:41,226
- Say...
- What?

164
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,955
And him?

165
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,594
Cast that leg,
and welcome to the family.

166
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:16,983
I have a house payment.

167
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:30,826
Excuse me, but...

168
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:35,568
I used to work in a bar, so I know
what it's like to wait on people.

169
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:39,009
I want to bring to your attention
that the service here...

170
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,741
needs immediate improvement.

171
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,374
What do you mean?

172
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,817
What do I mean?

173
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:50,687
Our waiter, where is he?

174
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,484
Don't tell me he's still
in the bathroom.

175
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,528
Our waiter never came back to see
if we wanted anything else. We did.

176
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,034
He never brought us our check.

177
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,537
We wanted it
so we could get the hell out.

178
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:12,904
Here. This should be sufficient.

179
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:15,413
And don't be expecting a tip.

180
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:19,779
If you don't treat me good,
I won't ask you out.

181
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:23,121
Your beer tastes like piss.

182
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,216
- We know!
- Because we piss in it!

183
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:27,920
That's not all.

184
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:33,756
Bad beer, bad service.
Don't people know not to come in here?

185
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:44,876
Two cervezas.

186
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:47,880
These are for you.

187
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,323
This will just take a minute.

188
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,618
I wanted to see the guitar.

189
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,352
Do you play?

190
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,722
Yes. Do you?

191
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:08,784
A little bit.

192
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:10,591
Play something.

193
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:13,390
Not right now.

194
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:16,629
This is my father's,
but he doesn't play anymore.

195
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:18,068
No?

196
00:23:18,138 --> 00:23:22,871
There's not much work for a mariachi.
He just watches TV.

197
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:26,876
I'm sorry to hear that.

198
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,472
He was never that good anyway.

199
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:31,983
Not as good as I'm going to be.
Listen to this.

200
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:40,656
Loosen your fingers.

201
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,558
Like this.

202
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:58,170
You know what I mean?
Loosen them up.

203
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,247
How do you do that?

204
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,476
All right.

205
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:06,348
Give me this.

206
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:15,919
Forget this hand.
You want to get faster.

207
00:24:17,097 --> 00:24:18,257
Here's the secret.

208
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,199
Got it? Good.

209
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,538
Practice this...

210
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,076
every day.

211
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,808
All day.

212
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:39,543
Next time...

213
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:44,820
I'll show you how to play a tune
using what you've learned.

214
00:24:49,062 --> 00:24:50,324
Practice.

215
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:18,650
This reminds me of a joke.

216
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,286
This guy comes into a bar.

217
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:27,322
Walks up to the bartender.
Says, "Bartender, I got a bet for you.

218
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,426
I'll bet you $300 that I can piss...

219
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:33,700
into that glass
and not spill a single drop."

220
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:38,306
This glass is ten feet away.

221
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:41,211
He says, "Let me get this straight.
You'll bet me $300...

222
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:44,273
that you can piss standing here...

223
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,615
way over there into that glass
and not spill a single drop?"

224
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:52,818
The guy says, "That's right."

225
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:55,292
The bartender says,
"Young man, you got a bet."

226
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:57,727
The guy goes, "Okay, here we go."

227
00:25:57,797 --> 00:26:00,163
Pulls out his thing.

228
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,633
He's looking at the glass.
He's thinking about the glass.

229
00:26:02,702 --> 00:26:05,000
Dick, glass.
Thinking about his dick.

230
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:09,064
Dick, glass. Dick, glass.
Be the glass. Dick, glass.

231
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:11,406
And then he lets it rip.

232
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:15,073
And he's pissing all over the place.

233
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:19,016
He's pissing on the bar,
the stools, the floor...

234
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:22,543
the phone, the bartender.

235
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:26,558
He's pissing everywhere
except the fucking glass.

236
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,093
Right?

237
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:32,564
So, the bartender is laughing
his fucking ass off. He's $300 richer.

238
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:35,924
Piss dripping off his face.

239
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:39,699
He says, "You fucking idiot! You got it
in everything except the glass.

240
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:44,171
You owe me $300, punta."

241
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:50,012
The guy goes, "Excuse me one second."
Goes in the back of the bar.

242
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:54,042
In the back, a couple guys playing pool.
He walks over to them.

243
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:56,745
Comes back to the bar.

244
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:00,020
Goes, "Here you go, Mr. Bartender.
$300."

245
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:01,720
The bartender's like...

246
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:05,025
"Why are you so happy?
You just lost $300, idiot!"

247
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:07,862
The guy says,
"See those guys there?

248
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:12,735
I just bet them $500 apiece...

249
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:15,137
that I could piss on your bar...

250
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,302
on your floor, on your phone
and piss on you...

251
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,774
and not only would you not be mad
about it...

252
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,317
you'd be happy."

253
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:35,458
That's funny shit!

254
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,962
"You'd be happy about it!"

255
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:44,431
Guess what?

256
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:51,240
He didn't check out.

257
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:53,302
And you...

258
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:56,473
you checked out just fine.

259
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:01,415
Well, I knew I would because...

260
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:04,251
me and Bucco we go way back.

261
00:28:04,324 --> 00:28:06,053
Him, too.

262
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:12,328
And this guy, I just met him today.

263
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:15,265
- Go in.
- Good work, by the way.

264
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:19,533
Good work. It's nice to see you
cross the I's and dot the T's here.

265
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:23,007
It's cool, ese.
Lead the way, Jorge.

266
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,553
In there?

267
00:29:10,223 --> 00:29:12,657
That's fucking disgusting.

268
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:35,279
What do you want?

269
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,845
I'm looking for work.

270
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,443
No work here.

271
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,755
I see.

272
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:51,791
Something to drink?

273
00:29:51,864 --> 00:29:53,764
Something in the guitar case?

274
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,357
Yeah.

275
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:56,732
What?

276
00:29:56,803 --> 00:29:58,464
My guitar.

277
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:06,437
Are you sure you don't want to hear
me play before you say there is no work?

278
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,576
We want to see what's in the case.

279
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:13,141
If it's what you say,
you can drink all you want.

280
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:19,351
But I told you already.

281
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:21,450
I'm a musician.
This is my guitar.

282
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:23,051
Don't touch it!

283
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:24,562
Get him away.

284
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:34,799
Hurry up!

285
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,671
How you doing?

286
00:30:38,745 --> 00:30:41,942
- What is it?
- It's a guitar.

287
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,481
It's a guitar.

288
00:30:49,455 --> 00:30:51,650
We heard stories
of a guitar case full of guns.

289
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,158
I know.

290
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,821
- Had to make sure.
- I understand.

291
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:02,457
It's him!

292
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:06,935
Yes, it's me.

293
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:11,873
I'm not against you guys,
so keep it down.

294
00:31:13,012 --> 00:31:15,708
I'm just looking for a man
who calls...

295
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,376
Not yet.

296
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,875
What's going on?

297
00:31:53,753 --> 00:31:55,050
Is that now?

298
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:39,429
- Watch him.
- What's going on?

299
00:32:49,275 --> 00:32:51,573
Friends of yours?

300
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:55,444
I swear I have no fucking idea
what the hell's going on!

301
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:10,627
Shit!

302
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:58,038
You missed me!

303
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:27,195
Get up.

304
00:34:29,575 --> 00:34:30,906
Come here.

305
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,214
I'm looking for a man
who calls himself Bucho.

306
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:41,677
That's all.

307
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:45,349
But you had to do it the hard way.

308
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,261
Listen to me.

309
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:56,233
I don't want to kill you.

310
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,100
I just want you to take me to him.
Understand?

311
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,218
You like to shoot me in the back?

312
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:22,355
Fucker!

313
00:35:57,396 --> 00:36:00,627
If you want to go, go.

314
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:04,160
If you want to stay...

315
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:07,662
Relax, okay?

316
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,014
Fuck you!

317
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:35,266
Look at you now.

318
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:49,819
The money's still in the back.
So is the pickup.

319
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:53,831
Pick-up Guy's lying on the floor
with three bullets in his head.

320
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:56,026
- Tavo must have shot him.
- Where's Tavo?

321
00:39:57,403 --> 00:40:00,236
- Tavo's outside, boss.
- Where?

322
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:01,671
Two blocks up.

323
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,300
Tell him to get his ass over here!

324
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:07,038
- I want to know what happened.
- He's dead.

325
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:44,447
I'll tell you, boss...

326
00:40:44,516 --> 00:40:46,950
whoever it was,
didn't come looking for the money.

327
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:50,420
No. They came looking for me.

328
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:57,092
You've heard stories about the man who
carries a guitar case full of weapons.

329
00:40:58,297 --> 00:41:01,528
Those are stories.
That's all they are.

330
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:12,275
Can't you see
we are fucking closed?

331
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,637
We must find him.

332
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:20,981
- You said the Colombians watch us.
- We must move quickly.

333
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:22,987
He's probably left town.

334
00:41:23,055 --> 00:41:25,421
He knows I'm here.

335
00:41:25,491 --> 00:41:28,654
He's not going anywhere.

336
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:38,804
Where am I?

337
00:41:38,804 --> 00:41:41,204
Where am I?

338
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:42,672
Bookstore.

339
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:45,266
Bookstore Cafe.

340
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,874
What the hell did you give me?

341
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:54,441
Painkillers.

342
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,782
I'm operating.

343
00:42:02,694 --> 00:42:04,594
Where is everybody?

344
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:09,032
I closed early so no one could come.
No one would come anyway.

345
00:42:11,603 --> 00:42:14,436
- Why?
- Nobody reads.

346
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:25,809
Is it yours? All those books?

347
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:27,852
It's mine.

348
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,081
My parents passed away.

349
00:42:30,155 --> 00:42:34,558
They left me the building and money.
I have an apartment upstairs.

350
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,891
Why a bookstore?

351
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:43,401
This town never had a bookstore...

352
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:45,699
so I get this bright idea.

353
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,132
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

354
00:42:54,379 --> 00:42:56,643
Why a bookstore?

355
00:42:56,715 --> 00:42:59,047
All right.
Isn't there a hospital?

356
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,019
Trust me. You don't want to go
to a hospital here.

357
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,055
You'll never find work
in this town.

358
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:09,921
What?

359
00:43:09,995 --> 00:43:13,931
The guitar.
Nobody hires musicians around here.

360
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,392
I know.

361
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:21,297
I use it to pick up girls.

362
00:43:21,373 --> 00:43:23,068
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

363
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:29,376
Come on!

364
00:43:37,356 --> 00:43:39,187
See this?

365
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:42,418
That had your name on it.

366
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,189
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

367
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:48,623
- You don't know my name.
- That's right.

368
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,567
I don't know your name.

369
00:43:52,638 --> 00:43:53,969
You smoke?

370
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,813
It's the least I can do for you
after saving my life.

371
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,917
Have a couple more.
Painkillers.

372
00:44:18,497 --> 00:44:19,794
Hot water.

373
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:23,999
Shit!
What do you do to me?

374
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:25,832
- I'm sorry.
- You're crazy.

375
00:44:25,904 --> 00:44:29,635
Relax.
This is the cold water.

376
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,611
Better?
Let's stitch you up.

377
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,846
Get out of here.

378
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,182
I know who you are.

379
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:28,817
Really?

380
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:33,264
You're that guy
you always hear stories about.

381
00:46:35,434 --> 00:46:38,460
- You kill drug dealers.
- I'm looking for Bucho. Know him?

382
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:43,372
I hope you don't think
you can take Bucho alone.

383
00:46:43,442 --> 00:46:45,535
- You know him?
- Yeah.

384
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:50,778
I have a few friends I can call.
They owe me a favor.

385
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,915
Don't complain.

386
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:58,388
That would be straight
if you hadn't been moving so much.

387
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:01,483
That one's worse.
Who did that one?

388
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,154
I did a long time ago.

389
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:13,603
I don't even want to know
what that is.

390
00:47:17,576 --> 00:47:20,101
Well, saved my life more than once.

391
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:27,009
- You can have it.
- Oh, no. Thanks.

392
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:28,916
No. I'm okay.

393
00:47:31,923 --> 00:47:33,857
Will you help me?

394
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,361
I don't think I can help you.

395
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:44,596
I need to leave my things here
for a few minutes.

396
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:50,337
- I can trust you?
- Yeah.

397
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,172
- Really?
- Yeah.

398
00:47:53,311 --> 00:47:54,938
All right.

399
00:47:55,013 --> 00:47:58,676
- Where are you going?
- I have to go to church.

400
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,277
- What for?
- Confess my sins.

401
00:48:02,354 --> 00:48:03,946
I'm a sinner.

402
00:48:04,022 --> 00:48:05,512
I know.

403
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,997
Did I thank you?

404
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:15,123
No, you didn't.

405
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,797
I will.

406
00:48:36,254 --> 00:48:38,381
Bucho, what do you think?

407
00:48:40,492 --> 00:48:43,791
Bulletproof windows, sidings...

408
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:45,523
the hood.

409
00:48:46,932 --> 00:48:49,093
Just what you asked for.

410
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:53,495
Listen.

411
00:48:53,572 --> 00:48:57,030
There are no pickups scheduled today
except one in Hidalgo.

412
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:58,541
Stay away from there.

413
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:02,376
The rest of the town is game.
Take this car and find him!

414
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:06,383
- I'll take my truck.
- Take the car. That's why I bought it.

415
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:11,115
If you see someone you don't know,
kill him. I can't take more chances.

416
00:49:16,261 --> 00:49:20,925
Sunroof is bulletproof. Works as a
shield for when they shoot from the top.

417
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,024
Look at this guy.

418
00:49:28,673 --> 00:49:32,541
It works. Now go and get him.
Zamira.

419
00:49:33,778 --> 00:49:37,908
Take her with you.
You'll need all the help you can get.

420
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,858
You, too.

421
00:50:22,594 --> 00:50:26,428
Bless me, Father,
for I have just killed quite a few men.

422
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:28,022
No shit!

423
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,263
From what I hear, you cleaned out
the entire Tarasco Bar.

424
00:50:32,337 --> 00:50:36,034
Nice job, asshole. Every hit man
in Cahilla's looking for you.

425
00:50:36,107 --> 00:50:39,941
- Things got out of hand.
- I told you, no more bloodbaths.

426
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:43,105
I told you, Bucho's the last one.

427
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:47,685
- After him, I'm finished.
- No, I'm finished.

428
00:50:47,752 --> 00:50:51,051
They killed the woman you loved. Okay.
Then they shot through your hand.

429
00:50:51,122 --> 00:50:56,059
Two points. Wake up.
There is no payback for that.

430
00:50:57,128 --> 00:50:58,390
Walk away.

431
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:04,559
Trust me. This is one you're not
going to want to see through to the end.

432
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,163
What do you mean?

433
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,505
Let's just say, I've done some checking.
Bucho is not someone to mess with.

434
00:51:12,577 --> 00:51:14,010
Trust me.

435
00:51:14,913 --> 00:51:16,847
I cannot leave without Bucho.

436
00:51:16,915 --> 00:51:20,009
You don't expect to live much longer?
Fine. I do.

437
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:22,883
Seriously. You need
any more help, don't call me.

438
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,821
Call your friends Campa and Quino.
They're crazy.

439
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,324
I should be able
to count on you! You!

440
00:51:28,393 --> 00:51:30,190
Those days are gone.

441
00:51:31,363 --> 00:51:32,660
Wait! Come on!

442
00:51:32,731 --> 00:51:35,393
Good luck. Don't get shot.

443
00:51:37,035 --> 00:51:39,503
Did you want confession?

444
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:45,467
Maybe later, Father,
because where I am going...

445
00:51:45,543 --> 00:51:48,137
I'd just have to come right back.

446
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:04,060
Hello.

447
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:12,325
Yeah?

448
00:52:14,773 --> 00:52:16,468
Look...

449
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:22,569
I didn't call about it before
because I could handle it.

450
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:27,907
Yes, he's got no place to go.

451
00:52:27,986 --> 00:52:32,787
I got my men on him right now.
What do you mean you brought someone in?

452
00:52:32,857 --> 00:52:35,951
How long has he been here?

453
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,154
Who is he?

454
00:52:39,164 --> 00:52:41,826
What are you talking about?
We can handle it.

455
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:47,668
Someone like that will tear the place up
and make a lot of noise.

456
00:52:50,608 --> 00:52:52,576
What does your guy look like?

457
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:58,315
I've got to know or the wrong people
might get killed.

458
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:03,382
Next time I'll call you sooner,
but I knew I could handle this so...

459
00:53:03,455 --> 00:53:05,184
Hello? Hello!

460
00:53:05,256 --> 00:53:06,518
Shit!

461
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:12,519
What's the number
to the phone in my car?

462
00:53:14,332 --> 00:53:17,324
Fuckheads, what's the number
to the phone in my car?

463
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,892
Number!

464
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,507
It's in your car, boss.

465
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:46,663
What is the fucking number
to the phone in my car?

466
00:53:51,703 --> 00:53:53,136
Fuck!

467
00:53:56,207 --> 00:53:58,266
What are you doing? Get away.

468
00:53:58,343 --> 00:54:00,373
You can't go away. I need you.
