1
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,212
You've sold us a bill of goods,
Gordon.

2
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,946
Promised new drugs to fight everything
from the common cold to cancer.

3
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:47,991
-We'll deliver everything we promised.
-I'm sorry, but the adventure is over.

4
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,622
We're exercising our option
to liquidate...

5
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,028
...Byron & Mitchell Research Limited.

6
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:59,329
Jack, show these people how filthy
rich we're gonna make them, please.

7
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,905
I don't think you understand
what I just said.

8
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,275
Oh, I think I understand.

9
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,211
Jack.

10
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,646
Perrinia immortalis.

11
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,287
The Blood Orchid.

12
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,685
First described in 1 892
by Houghton...

13
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:22,191
...the last person to see it until our
team brought a sample from Borneo.

14
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,428
It lies dormant for seven years,
then blooms for just six months.

15
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,432
Which means we just got
lucky as hell, gentlemen.

16
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,765
Anyone here familiar
with the Hayflick limit?

17
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,703
He proposed a cell
could only replicate 56 times...

18
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,866
...before it died from
a buildup of toxins.

19
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,369
According to him,
it's the reason we die.

20
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,878
But what if we could
transcend that limit?

21
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,947
That would be impossible.

22
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,310
Not according to our data.

23
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,446
Our research indicates the presence
of a chemical in Perrinia immortalis...

24
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,024
...that can significantly
prolong cellular life.

25
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,221
I can't support this.

26
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,061
Does that mean
what I think it means?

27
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,230
Are we talking about
a pharmaceutical equivalent...

28
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,836
...to the fountain of youth?

29
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,367
Exactly.

30
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,968
That'd be bigger than Viagra.

31
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,474
-Have you put this into human trials?
-We can't yet.

32
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,309
Our sample was degraded
in the initial study.

33
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,747
We need more of the orchid.

34
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,114
See, and that's our only problem,
gentlemen.

35
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,813
That orchid is only in bloom
for another two weeks.

36
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,089
Well, what the hell
are you waiting for?

37
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,826
Get your asses down to Borneo.

38
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,604
Yes.

39
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,604
-Welcome to Borneo.
-Thanks.

40
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,573
-What's wrong with this picture?
-I don't know. Let me see, you're in it?

41
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,112
We don't have a boat, okay?

42
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,681
Your company had one responsibility:
get a boat.

43
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,548
-And you've already screwed it up.
-Wait. Your girl chartered the boat.

44
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,815
Sam confirmed with the company.
They're waiting for your payment.

45
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,618
Hey. Hey, I've got something.

46
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,588
Payment cleared.

47
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,427
Really?

48
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,895
-Where's the boat?
-It's not coming.

49
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,629
All of the charter companies
have shut down.

50
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,670
No one'll risk going upriver
till after the rainy season.

51
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,672
-And when's that?
-Two, three weeks.

52
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,005
The orchid's only in bloom
for one more week, tops.

53
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,576
There's a local captain
named Jin-Soon.

54
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,716
I'm told he'll take anyone upriver,
for the right price.

55
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,035
Are you sure this is the place?

56
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,036
They said the one
with the red door.

57
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,972
I bet you somebody's playing
Russian roulette in there.

58
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,612
Maybe we'll get lucky
and you'll get a turn.

59
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,011
Hey, why don't you two just get a room.
Come on, Sam.

60
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,893
Wait here.

61
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,590
Yeah, if you insist.

62
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,363
Hey! Hey!

63
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,300
Jin-Soon.

64
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,012
Jin-Soon?

65
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,165
Your lndonesian sucks.

66
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,441
-Stick to English.
-We heard you could take us upriver.

67
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,339
In rainy season?

68
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,375
Won't be cheap.

69
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,449
We can pay you 25,000.

70
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,380
-I'll have a talk with the captain.
-You're not the captain?

71
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,380
Jin-Soon!

72
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,262
These tourists need a boat.
I told them not in the rainy season.

73
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,861
-You're Jin-Soon?
-Local nickname.

74
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,630
Name's Johnson. Bill Johnson.

75
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,432
It's a pronunciation thing.

76
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,105
And you can rent my boat
for 25 grand.

77
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,303
Now, you want me to drive it,
well...

78
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,072
...that'll cost you 50.

79
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,739
Fifty grand? Are you high?

80
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,545
You know what?
Don't answer that.

81
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,812
I'm not trusting him
with the expedition.

82
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:20,084
Listen. Lady.
Let's cut the bullshit, please.

83
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,092
If one of the other charter
companies could take you...

84
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,457
...you'd be on the river by now.

85
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,293
You only came to me
because you're desperate.

86
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,436
Fifty grand's my price.

87
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,071
Take it...

88
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,763
...or leave it.

89
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,632
I've seen subway cars
in better shape than this.

90
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,170
Yeah, she may be ugly...

91
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,071
...but she puts out.

92
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,549
-Shit!
-What took you so long?

93
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,921
Hey, you try getting a GPS locator,
a Sat-Nav EchoStar...

94
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,528
...and a UV spectrometer
past lndonesian customs.

95
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,391
-Complaining already.
-Yeah.

96
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,227
-You rather be back in the office?
-Hell, yeah.

97
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,892
I had courtside seats
at the Garden on Saturday.

98
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,732
I was gonna sit right between
Spike and Woody.

99
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,505
Oh, man, is that our ride?!

100
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,804
Look at the bright side, Cole.
At least the weather's nice.

101
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,273
Ben Douglas, team doctor.
You must be Sam.

102
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,180
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.

103
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,048
Glad to have you aboard.

104
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,252
I'm gonna get you for this.

105
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,518
Oh, yeah. This could be fun.

106
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,357
You can forget about that, dog.

107
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,931
That's one car you ain't
never gonna catch.

108
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,931
There's always a way.

109
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:14,269
-Your team's a little green, huh?
-My former grad students.

110
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,998
Best in their field.

111
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,400
Here's a tip for Wexell-Hall:

112
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,746
You want the best young talent...

113
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,278
...recruit early.

114
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,512
Yes, I'm sure Sam's very talented.

115
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,454
I think I resent that.

116
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,086
You and the other gal can stay in here.

117
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,523
You live here.

118
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,727
The way you say that,
I can tell you're impressed.

119
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,236
All right.

120
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,635
If you need anything....

121
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,173
Well...

122
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,072
...if you need anything,
you're shit out of luck.

123
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,476
Okay.

124
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:32,006
Now, this is where the exploratory
team found the orchid.

125
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,583
In the Selatan Basin.

126
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,278
-lt took them three days to get upriver.
-Yeah.

127
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,150
That was before
the rainy season.

128
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,717
These waterways
could be dangerous now.

129
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,056
-You said you'd get us there safely.
-And I will.

130
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,698
But safe isn't always quick.

131
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,027
We'll work our way up
one bend at a time.

132
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,466
If I don't like what I see,
we change course.

133
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,129
Can't chart the fastest route
before you begin.

134
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,740
Already have.

135
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,603
Check it. All right.

136
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,147
Now, we're uplinked in real time
to NASA and AsiaSatCom.

137
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,341
Now, under ideal conditions...

138
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,487
...this is the fastest route.

139
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:12,146
But once we superimpose weather
patterns for the past 1 0 years...

140
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,690
...and then extrapolate....

141
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,163
Bingo! It's Padrang
to the Selatan Basin.

142
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,364
I'm a bad man.

143
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,434
We got less than a week
to get to that orchid.

144
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,301
If you can't get the job done,
give our money back...

145
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,275
-...and we'll get somebody who can.
-I'll get you there.

146
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,767
God help me.

147
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,824
Something attacked me!

148
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,896
-Oh, my God!
-She said something attacked her.

149
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,095
No, no, no!

150
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,338
It's okay. It's okay.

151
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,736
What the helI'd you do?
You scared him.

152
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,342
I scared him?!

153
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,504
This is Kong.

154
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,614
Kong lives here.

155
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,143
You're guests.

156
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,848
Be nice.

157
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,656
Disgusting animal.

158
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,822
You okay now?

159
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,822
I'm fine. Just keep
your hands off of me.

160
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,265
Oh, yeah. Well, it's gonna be tough,
but I'll try.

161
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,345
No, no, the S-1 has to be on file
before the week is out.

162
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,919
-That's the whole point.
-Hello?

163
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:00,320
-The S-1 needs to be on file before....
-Yes, we were able to get on the river.

164
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,188
That's the purpose. We need
the comments from the SEC.

165
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,990
-Excuse me.
-It's the only place I can get reception.

166
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,191
-No, just get it done. Be ready to go....
-No, that's impossible....

167
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,360
-Hello? Hello? Damn!
-Hello? Bob? Damn it!

168
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,062
Try my phone.

169
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,800
Works just as good,
but it's free.

170
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:23,572
Okay. Maybe you can use my special
antenna to boost your reception.

171
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:28,146
We're dealing with a lithophytic vine,
so we want to search any rock face.

172
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,345
Now, this ridge here
seems a good bet.

173
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,887
Sam.

174
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,918
Come on, Sam. What do you say?

175
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,760
We're young. We're single.
We're in Borneo.

176
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,531
What do you got to lose?

177
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,828
Not satisfied, walk away.
No commitments.

178
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,001
"No commitments."

179
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,670
That's your pitch?

180
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,208
Did I say "No commitments"?
I meant marry me.

181
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,843
Am I gonna be dealing with this
for the next two weeks?

182
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,276
Yep.

183
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,799
So you were one of Jack's students?

184
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,630
Yeah. He was teaching a seminar
on botanical pharmacology.

185
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,364
Soon as I finished my dissertation,
he hired me.

186
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,633
Well, that's one way to get a leg-up.

187
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,309
What's that supposed to mean?

188
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,470
I had a professor
who wanted to hire me.

189
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,208
Of course, he wanted me
to be his secretary.

190
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,317
Look, if I've done something
to offend you--

191
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,547
No. No, dear, not at all.

192
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,626
Actually, I admire you.
Took me 1 0 years to get where I am.

193
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,730
Clearly, your generation
has it figured out.

194
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,736
Man, this is good.
Where'd you learn to cook like this?

195
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,345
-Little recipe I picked up in Sri Lanka.
-What were you doing there?

196
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,810
Doctors Without Borders.

197
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,480
It's my day job.

198
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,311
You guys expect to need a doctor?

199
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,953
Can't get the expedition
bonded without one.

200
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,488
Well, you just think of me
as a charming insurance policy.

201
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,029
Hey!

202
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,855
You've had your dinner.

203
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,695
Get out of here.

204
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,767
What'd I say?

205
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,179
There's not that much....

206
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,316
I'm not sleeping up there.
I ain't sleeping on the floor.

207
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,078
I ain't sleeping on no damn....

208
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,984
-Oh, shit. What was that?
-What the hell was that?

209
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,590
-Something's getting eaten.
-By what?

210
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,255
Everything gets eaten out here.

211
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,123
It's the jungle.

212
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,270
Kong.

213
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,475
Hey. You guys seen Kong?

214
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,613
No. Not since last night.

215
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,052
Where are you?

216
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,010
Kong?

217
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:02,025
We need those results by next month
if we want the FDA off our backs.

218
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,253
Hello? Shit!

219
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,794
I can't hear you!

220
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,228
Can you hear me now?

221
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,493
How about now?

222
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,068
Can you hear me now?

223
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,637
-Can you hear me now?
-We can!

224
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,603
Can you hear me now?

225
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,802
-Gail! Oh, my God.
-Shit.

226
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,439
Stop the boat!

227
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,356
-I'll go.
-All right.

228
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,520
Hey, Gail! Can you hear me now?!

229
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,329
Oh, I'm gonna kill you!

230
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,469
Stroke, Gail, stroke. Come on.

231
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,969
-Watch your back.
-Hey, Gail! How's the water?

232
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,475
Drop the phone.
It's probably holding you back.

233
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,177
-All right.
-Stay calm.

234
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,512
-Stay calm.
-Use your phone for flotation.

235
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,621
All right, come on, Gail.

236
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,755
-You're almost there.
-It's just like a phone.

237
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,128
I got it.

238
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,358
-Holy shit!
-Holy shit!

239
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,331
Come on! Come on!

240
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,675
-Get out!
-Hurry up!

241
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,034
Hurry up! Hurry up!

242
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,237
-Come on! Come on!
-Gail, grab it.

243
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,882
-Look out!
-Watch out!

244
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,059
Oh, my God.

245
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,755
Get him, Bill! Get him, Bill!
Get him in the eye, man!

246
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,701
Bill?

247
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,614
Where'd he go?

248
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,045
-Where'd he go?!
-Bill!

249
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,690
I don't see him.

250
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,723
-Where's he gone?
-Oh, my God.

251
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,929
Oh, shit, you won.

252
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:43,020
-You're okay?
-I lost my phone.

253
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,313
Sorry to hear it.

254
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,495
That was either the bravest
or the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

255
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,865
It's a fine line.

256
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,647
-Good as new.
-Thanks.

257
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,326
To Gail...

258
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,726
...who knows it's better to eat
than be eaten.

259
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,628
-To Gail.
-Yeah, yeah, baby.

260
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,202
Almost eaten just to find a flower.

261
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,467
-Hardly seems worth it.
-Oh, it's worth it.

262
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,040
I mean, think about it.

263
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,304
A pill that you take every day
for the rest of your life.

264
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,845
Now, even if we charge,
say, a dollar a pop...

265
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,243
-...we're billionaires.
-Yeah.

266
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,583
-That's what I'm talking about, baby.
-At $1 00 a bottle...

267
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,486
...I'll dive in that river
and fight that croc myself.

268
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,423
So how many flowers does it take
to save the world?

269
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,395
Figure 50 orchids will yield
about an ounce of chemical.

270
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,401
You could have a football field
full of those orchids...

271
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,540
...still doesn't mean you can get it
through human trials.

272
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,338
She doesn't even believe in you.

273
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,134
Comes with the territory.

274
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,906
In research,
you've got to go out on a limb.

275
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,947
And there's always someone
waiting to chop it off.

276
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,714
Where the hell have you been?

277
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,191
-Damn that thing!
-Where you been, boy?

278
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,849
Calm down. Calm down.

279
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,892
-Poor guy.
-It's okay. It's all right.

280
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,927
Looks like he's seen a ghost.

281
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:37,299
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

282
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,866
What if Gail's right?

283
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,572
I mean, cells in a petri dish
are one thing.

284
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,372
-Human trials are another.
-She's wrong.

285
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,974
And when it goes to product...

286
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,178
...and you and I can cash in
our stock options...

287
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,651
-...we'll rub her face in it.
-Stock options.

288
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,455
I spoke to Mitchell.

289
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,391
We're each giving you half a point.

290
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,556
I don't know what to say.

291
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,995
Don't say anything.

292
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,396
You deserve it.

293
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,836
All this...

294
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,240
...wouldn't be possible
without your work.

295
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:23,809
Jack.

296
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,209
Thought we decided against that.

297
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,718
Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,016
You're right.
It would be fun, though.

299
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,453
I mean, here we are,
traveling upriver...

300
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,823
...to the greatest discovery
of our careers.

301
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:42,455
Now, if this orchid thing
works out, then...

302
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,965
...who knows?

303
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,964
Is that why I'm here?

304
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,968
So you can give us one more try?

305
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,407
You're here because
you're the best researcher I've got.

306
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,477
Am I interrupting something?

307
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,645
No. No, I was....

308
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,444
-I was just going to bed.
-Yeah.

309
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,782
Well, before you do that,
we need to talk.

310
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,866
We got a problem.

311
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,797
See the water level?

312
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,628
In high water,
the Mendranang gets rough.

313
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,297
We could turn around,
try to find another course.

314
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,843
-But that would take at least two days.
-We don't have the time.

315
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,872
If the river becomes impassable,
it'll take a lot longer.

316
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,415
And if we turn back,
then we're definitely screwed.

317
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,817
We're gonna have to risk it.

318
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,082
What if I don't wanna risk it?

319
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,157
Do you have any idea
what this flower means?

320
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,130
We're talking about the biggest
medical discovery in history.

321
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,997
That does sound great, Jack.

322
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,897
But I was never any good at history.

323
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,504
You want me to risk
the Mendranang...

324
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,838
...it'll cost you
an extra 50 thousand.

325
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,548
Done.

326
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,585
Done?

327
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,019
You gotta ask the boss lady
or something?

328
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,091
I'll pay it myself.

329
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,119
All right.

330
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,958
You got yourself a deal.

331
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,360
But if we hit trouble...

332
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,968
...your people do what I say,
you got that?

333
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,400
You're the captain.

334
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,919
Research proposals?

335
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,956
Yeah. Research proposals.

336
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,789
You're not the only company
we're in bed with.

337
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,795
We're the prettiest
and most popular.

338
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,059
Like sleeping with
the head cheerleader.

339
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,500
Not quite.

340
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,263
Come on, you know you love us.

341
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,972
I love your cash.

342
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,372
Then let me
get a look at that file.

343
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:09,479
After this orchid thing goes bust,
you'll be finished at Wexell-Hall.

344
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,447
Unless you got
something else lined up.

345
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:15,185
You really wanna see us fail,
don't you?

346
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,015
No.

347
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,749
I just think that you will.
I am a scientist, you know.

348
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,549
Scientist.

349
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,156
What're you doing at Wexell-Hall?

350
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,298
I like science.

351
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,057
I just like money better.

352
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,164
I'll drink to that.

353
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,540
River's flooded.
We can't see the banks.

354
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,344
Miss our turnoff?

355
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,384
It's just ahead.

356
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,590
What the hell was that?

357
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,153
-Rudder's jammed.
-What?

358
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,793
Watch out.

359
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:38,963
Shit!

360
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,167
Get up! Everybody up!

361
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,604
Hey.

362
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,453
What's going on?

363
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,145
Goddamn it.

364
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,114
Shit! We've blown the head gasket.

365
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,520
Are we all right?

366
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,189
Hey, what's going on?

367
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,822
-What is it?
-We got problems.

368
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,365
-What's wrong, man?
-Bill, wait.

369
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,470
What are you talking about?
What problems?

370
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,806
Son of a bitch.
The current's too strong.

371
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:43,397
-We missed our turnoff.
-I know. Come on, baby.

372
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,294
Come on, man.

373
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,464
-What is it?
-What is it?

374
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,443
What do you see?

375
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,306
Come on.

376
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,247
You got this. Come on, girl.

377
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,128
-Everybody! Hang on!
-Hang on to what?!

378
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,166
Come on!

379
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,931
Oh, shit!

380
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,175
Holy shit.

381
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,700
It's sinking, it's sinking!

382
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,634
-Where's Cole?
-Swim to the rocks, this way.

383
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,532
Keep going.

384
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,376
-Come on, get to the rocks.
-Get to the rocks.

385
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,780
-Where's Cole? Cole!
-Over there.

386
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,944
Over there! Over there!

387
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,692
Come on, man. Give me your hand!

388
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,962
Come on.

389
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,628
You got it, Sam. Come on.

390
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,430
Give me your hand.
I've got you, I've got you.

391
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,599
Give me your hand,
give me your hand.

392
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,167
Okay, I got her.

393
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:08,546
You almost got us killed!

394
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,638
You almost got us killed!

395
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,305
You think I wanted this?
I just lost my damn boat!

396
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,348
You'll lose your pay
if you don't get us out.

397
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,716
You said you'd get us there safely.
You should've turned around.

398
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,413
That's enough!

399
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,226
There's nothing
we can do about that now.

400
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,823
It's a waste of energy.

401
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,628
What have we got?

402
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:36,330
Some specimen jars,
a map, a little water, no food.

403
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,666
Hard drive's ruined.

404
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,074
Well, pretty much
all the equipment's shot.

405
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,450
Except one of the SAT phones
still works. It's on-line.

406
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,587
Thank God, we can call the police.

407
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,350
Police. The nearest river patrol
is back in Padrang.

408
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,093
The only way to get to us
is over that.

409
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,854
Are you saying we're stuck here?

410
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,229
Maybe not.

411
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,432
We're here.
The valley's completely flooded.

412
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,935
But I got a friend who operates
a boat on the Tokut River.

413
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:17,973
I can give him a call, and he can
meet us here at Naga Rock.

414
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,511
How far is that?

415
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,012
I don't know.
A two-day hike down the river.

416
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,848
But if we bushwhack,
we cut at least a day off the trek.

417
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,924
Oh, my God.
You wanna go through that?

418
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,492
It's the shortest way.

419
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,490
We could be safely in the Tokut
by nightfall.

420
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,959
So we can continue
with the expedition.

421
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,994
-Yeah. I'll get you to the flower.
-I don't care about that flower...

422
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,573
-...just get us to safety.
-It's the same thing.

423
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:48,667
We can either be on my buddy's boat
in 1 0 hours, or we can sit here...

424
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,406
...and wait for the river patrol
for days.

425
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,781
Your friend. Is he reliable?

426
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,844
Absolutely.

427
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,288
You better not screw me on this.

428
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,484
Sounds like you're already
screwed, mate.

429
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,492
Pay you two grand.

430
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,027
I need you on this one, John.

431
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,394
Yes, yes, so it seems.

432
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:16,430
Look, Billy, I'd love to help you out,
but I'm flat out, mate, you know.

433
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:20,575
Probably squeeze you in for,
say, 5 grand?

434
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,078
You're killing me.

435
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,342
That's mates rates.
Or you could always...

436
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,918
...hike back to Padrang
if you wanna save bucks.

437
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:33,079
-Up to you, pal.
-Fine. Five.

438
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,421
-Yes!
-But you better be there.

439
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:39,051
Otherwise, I'll tell your wife
about that little trip to Bangkok.

440
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,428
Wife's long gone, Billy.

441
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,164
Long gone, mate.

442
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,870
All right, people, we're on.
Saddle up.

443
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:57,982
Stay together. This jungle is all green
all the time, and you will get lost.

444
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,066
It's like doing a StairMaster
in a sauna.

445
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:27,508
Yeah. I might die of a heat stroke,
but I'll have a nice tight ass.

446
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,211
That's the spirit, Cole.

447
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:36,482
-You want me to grab that?
-ls that a trick question?

448
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,745
Here, man.

449
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,584
Right between Spike and Woody.

450
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,389
Right between Spike and Woody.

451
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,598
You okay, Sam?

452
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,659
I'm fine.

453
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:01,239
See, a crisis separates
the real men from the pretenders.

454
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,642
Yeah. Can see that.

455
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,308
What, that?

456
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,178
That's nothing.

457
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,358
I tricked him into taking my bag.

458
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,466
Hey. Mind if I give it a try?

459
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,973
Knock yourself out.

460
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,474
Hey.

461
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,155
I'm sorry about your boat.

462
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,947
Yeah, well...

463
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,027
...it was a piece of shit anyway.

464
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,014
Can we go around?

465
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:24,218
Yeah, we could.
But we'd lose another day.

466
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,561
Let's go.

467
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,070
Shit.

468
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,732
Hey. Knock it off.

469
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,493
-Shit! What was that?
-What was what?

470
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,267
-Something just moved.
-Please don't say that.

471
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,929
I'm serious. Something moved.

472
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,371
"Something just moved"
as in something's alive?

473
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,068
Shit! There it is again.
There's something in here!

474
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,440
There's probably
a million things in here.

475
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,242
He's right. Just keep moving.

476
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,759
Stop it.

477
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,738
I swear to God, if you don't stop it....

478
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,740
Very funny.

479
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,213
Ben?

480
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,551
-Where'd he go?
-Shit!

481
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,362
Help me!

482
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,551
Run!

483
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,361
-What the hell was that thing?!
-Anaconda.

484
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,835
-Oh, great!
-There's snakes out here that big?

485
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,600
-Yes, but--
-But what? It swallowed him whole!

486
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,403
Calm down and listen for a second.
I can explain--

487
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,979
No, you calm down and listen!
Ben was eaten by a freaking snake.

488
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,548
-Okay? A freaking snake!
-Cole.

489
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,515
-Oh, God. Oh, my God. I mean....
-Cole.

490
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,848
Oh, my God, did you see that thing?

491
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,116
We don't got a chance against that!

492
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,624
I mean, Mitchell. Mitchell.
Listen to me, man.

493
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:47,093
I watch the Discovery Channel.
I'm telling you, we got no chance!

494
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,596
We're like mice in an aquarium.
You understand?

495
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,235
I mean, we're gonna die, girl.
We're gonna die!

496
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,100
Cole, calm down. Okay?

497
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,332
-Okay?
-All right, Jack, I'm okay.

498
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,738
Okay. I'll just....

499
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,276
I'm gonna--

500
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,847
I'm gonna sit right here.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

501
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,619
Listen. Anacondas are territorial.

502
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:13,416
A snake that size
will hunt a huge area.

503
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,722
There won't be another one
for miles.

504
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,296
We gotta get to the boat.
It's not that far.

505
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,931
So if we keep moving
and stick together...

506
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,460
-...we should be fine.
-We should be?!

507
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,635
How big do they get?

508
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:34,266
That was the biggest one I've ever
seen by far. A freak of nature.

509
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,671
The odds of running into another
that size are astronomical.

510
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,248
Yeah, but how do we know
the one that got Ben...

511
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,510
...is not gonna come after us?

512
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,481
It takes them weeks to digest.

513
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:48,650
Meal like that,
he'll be sleeping it off for a while.

514
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,793
Let's just get to that boat
and get home.

515
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,631
What about the orchid?

516
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,697
You've gotta be kidding me.

517
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,968
It won't bloom
for another seven years.

518
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,807
-This expedition is over, Jack.
-Now, hold on a second, Gail.

519
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:14,684
-There's a lot of money at stake here.
-I don't care. Ben is dead!

520
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,217
We have lost someone.

521
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:20,354
As Wexell-Hall's representative,
I am calling this expedition off.

522
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,822
-You don't have the authority.
-Check your contract.

523
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,858
We're in the middle of the jungle.

524
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,554
At this point, your authority
is what we say it is.

525
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:36,197
Jack, I'm with her.
I gotta get the hell out of here, man.

526
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,810
Look. Ben was my friend, okay?

527
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,381
I got him into this, and no one
feels worse about it than I do.

528
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,211
I don't wanna do
anything stupid.

529
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,853
I just wanna accomplish
what we came here for.

530
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,115
If we turn back now,
Ben's death would be for nothing.

531
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,197
Let's just get back to the boat.

532
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,798
We can regroup
and make our decision then.

533
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,266
Fine.

534
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,814
Jack.

535
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,850
-Maybe Gail's right.
-She's just scared.

536
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,987
Once we get back to the boat,
she'll be okay.

537
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,790
When we get back to the boat,
this expedition is over.

538
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:36,228
I'm taking these people to safety.

539
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,958
Hey, hey, hey. We had a deal.

540
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,734
Keep your money, doc.
Someone is dead.

541
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,805
We're officially in over our heads.

542
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,632
You said we wouldn't
run into another one of them.

543
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,643
And we probably won't,
but I can't guarantee it.

544
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,610
So I'll get you to the boat...

545
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,580
...and after that we're done.

546
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,020
Well, that answers it.

547
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,785
That answers nothing. I'll just throw
more money at him at the boat.

548
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,327
If he doesn't take it,
I'll offer his friend the same deal.

549
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:10,058
-Jack. Maybe we should listen--
-lf we don't get to that orchid now...

550
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,964
...all of our work
will have been for nothing.

551
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,229
I need your support, okay? You have
as much riding on this as I do.

552
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,466
Don't let me down.

553
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,376
I saw this special on Animal Planet.
Anacondas are vicious.

554
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,986
They hunt for sport.
Don't even need to see you.

555
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,282
Just use their tongues
to sense body heat--

556
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,651
Shut the hell up.

557
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,692
I knew this guy who knew this guy
who shot documentaries.

558
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:41,661
He went to the Amazon with this crew,
and they were all eaten by snakes.

559
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,960
Come on, you knew a guy who
knew a guy, that's an urban myth.

560
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,845
I'm sorry about Ben.

561
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,382
I never should've stayed
on the Mendranang.

562
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,877
What do you mean?

563
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:07,546
Well, I figured he didn't tell the others,
but I thought you knew.

564
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,153
Knew what?

565
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,690
Byron offered me an extra 50 grand
to stay on the river.

566
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:19,034
I told him it might get rough,
but he wanted to risk it.

567
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:22,238
Hey. Don't blame him.

568
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,203
It was my call.

569
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,967
I took the money.

570
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,873
I thought I could get us through.

571
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:32,775
You wanna blame anyone?
You blame me.

572
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,122
These boots are killing me.

573
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,531
-Cole.
-What?

574
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,962
You got some....

575
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,264
Oh, God, what is that?!
Get it off! Get it off!

576
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,239
-Oh, my God! Take it off!
-Relax.

577
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:01,944
-Help me! Help me!
-Hold on.

578
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,046
-Get it off me!
-Hey! Calm down!

579
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,647
-Get this off me!
-Calm down!

580
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,909
Cole! Cole! Calm down.

581
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,883
What is it? What is it?

582
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,853
-Get it off me. Get it off.
-All right. Look.

583
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:16,652
-Just a lighter. Just a lighter.
-Oh, hell no! You ain't burning me!

584
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:19,819
Okay. Okay. Okay.

585
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,462
You burn me, I'll kill you.

586
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,892
-Okay, okay, okay.
-All right.

587
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,340
-You all right? You okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine.

588
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,474
-What?
-Hold on. Put your arms up.

589
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,045
What are you doing?

590
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:39,778
Why are you going under my shirt?

591
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,783
-What are you doing?
-Jesus.

592
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:45,921
What, what? What is it?

593
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,248
What is it? What is it?

594
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,018
Anybody got a blowtorch?

595
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,373
Stop!

596
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:10,575
Careful.

597
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,915
-What's it--?
-lf that thing bit you...

598
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,818
...you would be lumpuh.

599
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:23,385
Paralyzed, like stone, for two days.

600
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,765
-What do you call this fella?
-Laba laba batu. Stone spider.

601
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:43,470
I may have discovered a valuable
new anesthetic agent for Wexell-Hall.

602
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,515
Oh, no, no, no. Forget Wexell,
we can get this to the highest bidder.

603
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:51,153
All right. Show and tell's over.

604
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:55,587
We gotta get to that boat.
Put your boots on and let's go.

605
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,131
Bugger it.

606
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:15,740
What the hell was that?

607
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,858
Holy bloody hell.

608
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,959
Whoa! What was that?

609
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,996
Oh, my God.

610
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,065
What the hell was that?

611
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:14,970
Come on.

612
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,978
No, no, no! Oh, come on, man!

613
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,848
What the hell happened?!

614
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,241
Livingston!

615
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:32,413
Here we go.

616
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,717
He got drunk and fell off
the bloody boat!

617
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,964
Your friend! Your friend!
Now what we gonna do now?!

618
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,395
Shit!

619
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,267
Search the wreckage.

620
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,439
Find anything we can use.

621
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,770
And hope to God there's a phone.

622
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,599
Come on, come on.

623
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,326
Yes.

624
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,579
Hello?

625
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,773
Hello?

626
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,918
-Come on, come on!
-Anything?

627
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:37,576
-Nothing.
-Keep trying.

628
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:40,120
What do you think I'm doing, Jack?!

629
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,150
Hello? Shit.

630
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,697
Hello?

631
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,599
Come on, man. Hello?

632
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,536
All right, keep looking!

633
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,517
No phone?

634
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,786
-Nothing.
-Couldn't get a signal on the radio.

635
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,854
Now what?

636
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,640
What's going on?

637
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,281
Where'd these come from?

638
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,883
-Lopaks.
-Who?

639
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,385
Local tribe.

640
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,785
-Descended from headhunters.
-What?

641
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,254
Been in this region
for thousands of years.

642
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,123
-Headhunters?
-There's still some villages here.

643
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:56,163
-Must be one of their fishing spots.
-Hold on, excuse me.

644
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,994
Did you say headhunters?

645
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:02,331
There haven't been practicing
headhunters in Borneo for a century.

646
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:06,134
Just because they ain't practicing
don't mean they don't remember how.

647
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,806
They must be along this branch
of the river.

648
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:14,409
If we can find their village,
maybe they can lend us a boat.

649
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:20,082
So wait a minute. We just gonna walk
towards the headhunters, not away?

650
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,216
Yeah.

651
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:24,693
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

652
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:48,483
Oh, God. I'm so hungry, I'd sell
my grandmother for a Tic Tac.

653
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,444
You mention food one more time...

654
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,651
...I'm voting you off this island.

655
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,132
Oh, God.

656
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:12,168
-ls that--?
-Livingston.

657
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,970
Oh, my God, man.
What the hell happened to him?

658
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,772
Anaconda.

659
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,041
If he was eaten by the snake...

660
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,152
-...why is his body--?
-Listen, listen!

661
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:31,689
All right. These things are
at their weakest when they digest.

662
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:36,425
But if threatened, they will spit up
their food and attack again.

663
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,591
What? There's a snake out there
with an empty stomach?

664
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,896
-Yeah.
-The same one that got Ben?

665
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:46,031
No. No. There's no way that snake
could've gotten to Livingston.

666
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:49,076
-lt had to be another one.
-You said there wouldn't be...

667
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:51,372
-...another one for miles.
-There wouldn't.

668
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,949
-Unless....
-Unless what?

669
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,015
-Unless it's mating season.
-Oh, my God.

670
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,214
-Mating season?
-Yeah.

671
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:06,251
You see, the males are territorial,
but when they smell a female in heat...

672
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,822
...they come running
from everywhere.

673
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:14,561
Females find a nice, wet, muddy pit,
and they all go after her at once...

674
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,406
...in one big mating ball.

675
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,906
So there's some snake orgy
out in the jungle?!

676
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,941
Yeah. Something like that.

677
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:25,137
Look, we're losing the light.

678
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:30,819
All we gotta do is get to that village.
So please, pay attention.

679
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:35,591
Do not stray from the group.

680
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,527
Let's go.

681
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:56,139
Stay quiet. Sacred burial ground.

682
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,113
Jesus.

683
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:39,644
I thought you said that anaconda
was the biggest you'd ever seen.

684
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,422
It was.

685
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,855
-Well, this one's....
-Bigger.

686
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:47,626
The males must've come through here
looking for the female.

687
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,974
Some bullshit.

688
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,877
-They took their boats.
-Good for them.

689
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,110
Bad for us.

690
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,520
Which one's the Mendranang?

691
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:16,153
On the right.
The Tokut keeps going to the left.

692
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,988
-Fastest way to Kotabaru.
-How long?

693
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:24,266
You'll be soaking in a tub
at the Four Seasons in two days.

694
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,368
How, man?
We don't even have a boat.

695
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:27,935
We're gonna build one.

696
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:58,529
Man, do that in my neighborhood,
and that's your ass.

697
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,663
Shit.

698
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:38,633
Sam.

699
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,075
What does this look like to you?

700
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,346
My God.

701
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,756
Perrinia immortalis.

702
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,461
Now we know why these snakes
are so big.

703
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:03,894
What?

704
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:06,763
Anacondas keep growing
till they die, right?

705
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,870
And these are the biggest
Bill's ever seen.

706
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,165
-Because they're living longer.
-Exactly.

707
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,576
Because Perrinia immortalis
is part of the food chain.

708
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,638
These snakes have transcended
the Hayflick limit.

709
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:21,147
The chemical in the orchid
does exactly what we predicted.

710
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:24,650
And not in theory, in the real world.

711
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:29,648
This is proof, Sam,
of your research, carved in stone.

712
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,650
This is proof?

713
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,890
It's anecdotal evidence at best.

714
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:39,697
-Let's get to the orchid and find out.
-You are out of your mind.

715
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,734
Do you have any idea
how close we are?

716
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,318
The orchid was found here...

717
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,047
...on the Mendranang,
just around the next bend.

718
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:03,122
-We'll be going right past it.
-No, we won't.

719
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,021
We are going down the Tokut.

720
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,856
If we go down the Mendranang,
it's gonna be a week...

721
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:12,400
...before we reach another village.
I'm not waiting that long for my bath.

722
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,930
Yeah, well, it's not up to you.

723
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,838
Jack.

724
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,903
Maybe you can just come back.

725
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,107
Come back?

726
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,878
In seven years?
What if it's not here?

727
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:35,457
What if some local farmer decides
to slash and burn the entire basin?

728
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:39,061
Instead of the fountain of youth,
we'll have a giant rice paddy.

729
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,292
This is our only chance.
You know it is.

730
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:48,832
Do you wanna give in
when we're this close?

731
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:53,101
Look. You know
I got your back, right?

732
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,744
We've been in the trenches
a hundred times together.

733
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:01,475
-But I'm not going in that jungle.
-Damn straight, man.

734
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,149
Thank you.

735
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,591
This is my expedition,
and we're going to the orchid.

736
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,292
No.

737
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,696
We're not.

738
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,567
Don't be an idiot, Sam.

739
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,065
This is bigger than penicillin,
for God's sake.

740
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,904
Lives will be saved by this drug.

741
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,603
People will live longer.
They'll stay young longer.

742
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:36,013
If we don't put this to human trials,
it'll be a crime against humanity.

743
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:37,652
Two people have died already.

744
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,948
Scientists have always risked
their lives to change the world.

745
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:45,356
If they didn't, we wouldn't have cures
for yellow fever, polio and smallpox.

746
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:48,463
-We all knew the risks.
-We thought we did.

747
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:52,089
Until you decided to start making
decisions behind our backs.

748
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:58,839
-What are you talking about?
-He offered Bill an extra 50 grand...

749
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:02,034
...to keep going, even though
he knew it wasn't safe.

750
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,838
Oh, my God.

751
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,341
Is that true, Jack?

752
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:14,113
-I was thinking of the expedition.
-You were thinking of your career.

753
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:21,421
Look. You're my assistant.

754
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:23,893
I don't need to consult you!

755
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,372
I'm the one with the authority here.

756
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:36,374
We're in the middle
of the jungle, Jack.

757
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,845
At this point, your authority
is what we say it is.

758
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,879
Guess you got a mutiny
on your hands.

759
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:06,841
Thank you.

760
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,311
Okay. Keep it high.

761
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,981
Careful.

762
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,220
Center it right here.

763
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:25,792
All right.

764
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,007
What are you doing?

765
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,939
Never seen a man shave before?

766
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,706
Probably a lot sharper
before you attacked that alligator.

767
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,449
Crocodile.

768
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,452
What's that mean?

769
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:57,289
That means "a new beginning."
It's Korean.

770
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,821
I got it when I was in the military.

771
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:01,625
What brought you here?

772
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:06,157
-Long story.
-Where am I gonna go?

773
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,331
All right.

774
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:12,864
Here's the deal.
I was in the Special Forces...

775
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:16,341
...and I saw and did things...

776
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:19,845
...that I wanted to forget.

777
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:24,050
Sometimes we do the wrong things
for the right reasons, you know?

778
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,117
It's not very long, as stories go.

779
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,450
Yeah.

780
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,623
Well, I got out of the military...

781
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:35,525
...came here and bought
the Bloody Mary.

782
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,291
Just wanted to start a new life.

783
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,117
Thank you, Jack.

784
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,347
On three.

785
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:31,179
Ready? One, two, three.

786
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,685
It works.

787
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,150
All right.

788
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,637
Let me explain.

789
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:59,313
Why in the hell didn't you tell me
about this?

790
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:06,312
The minute someone makes a call...

791
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:07,854
...this expedition's over.

792
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,286
Exactly.

793
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,158
All I'm asking for
is a few more hours.

794
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,956
We continue on the Mendranang...

795
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:18,459
...take our orchid samples,
then we call for help.

796
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:21,194
Forget about it, Jack.
I'm getting us out of here.

797
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,806
Think about this, Gordon.

798
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:29,035
You're about to become a billionaire.
Do you really want to give all that up?

799
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,406
I don't care about the money,
all right?

800
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,377
I wanna live.

801
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,294
It bit me.

802
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:56,034
Jack, what are you...?

803
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,076
What are you...?

804
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,454
Help.

805
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,753
Help.

806
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:28,193
Help me.

807
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,243
Where's Mitchell?

808
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:38,141
Resting his feet.

809
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,214
-Should I go get him?
-No, no.

810
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:42,782
-Let him rest till we get loaded.
-Okay.

811
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,716
Those blisters are pretty nasty.

812
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,205
Mitchell...

813
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,637
...you okay?

814
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:13,873
Mitchell?

815
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:17,646
What is it?

816
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:20,353
Tell me.

817
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,157
What did you do to him, Jack?

818
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:05,191
-What is it?
-Something's wrong with Mitchell.

819
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:08,430
-What are you talking about?
-You were alone with him.

820
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,367
What did you do?

821
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,133
He was resting his feet.
I didn't do anything.

822
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:25,076
-Shit.
-Oh, my God.

823
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:36,064
Oh, my God.

824
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,601
Gail, no! Let's go!

825
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,270
Get out! Get out! Go!

826
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,831
Come on! Come on!

827
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,811
Move! Move! Move! Go!

828
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,853
The raft!

829
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:11,294
No! You son of a bitch!

830
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:15,002
We can build another one.

831
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:17,600
With what?!

832
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,035
With what, Sam?!

833
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:21,842
We gotta get to the raft.

834
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:26,136
-It's our only way out of here.
-FYl, Bill, the raft is gone!

835
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:28,779
-We can get it back.
-How?!

836
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,513
How? We gonna swim
after it now?

837
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:34,583
Look...

838
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,024
...the village is here.

839
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:39,686
Jack is following
the Mendranang.

840
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:41,992
We cut across the jungle.

841
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:45,300
-We can catch him on the other side.
-Right.

842
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:48,534
-Catch him where?
-He's going to that orchid.

843
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,634
We find that flower...

844
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,677
...we find that raft.

845
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:13,829
Oh, thank God. It's Jack Byron.

846
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,093
Oh, thank God. It's Jack Byron.

847
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:18,460
Listen, something terrible
has happened.

848
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:21,626
We took the wrong way
on the Mendranang.

849
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:23,533
We went over a waterfall.

850
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,964
I haven't seen anyone since.
I am....

851
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,375
I think I'm the only one left.

852
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:35,616
Wait, wait. Listen.

853
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,784
Oh, shit. Come on!

854
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,329
It's in front of us.

855
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:59,804
Son of a bitch.
It's trying to separate us.

856
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:04,776
Oh, shit.

857
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,518
-Oh, Christ, it's everywhere.
-Turn that goddamn thing off.

858
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:12,517
-They can see it.
-Doesn't matter.

859
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:15,020
-They can sense our body heat.
-He's right.

860
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,090
Let's just get the hell out of here.

861
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,675
-Which way?
-Hold on.

862
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:48,049
Any way.

863
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:50,951
-Let's go, Cole!
-Okay, okay!

864
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:52,684
-Wait for me!
-Come on!

865
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:54,658
Hold on, wait for me!

866
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:04,971
Oh, my God.

867
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:18,214
If there's a way in, there's a way out.

868
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,526
Oh, shit!

869
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,841
-Guys?!
-Cole!

870
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:49,511
Which way?!

871
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:51,118
Over here!

872
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:56,456
-All right, say it again! Say it again!
-Cole! Over here!

873
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,653
Over here, Cole!

874
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,762
-Hello!
-This way, Cole!

875
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,864
-Guys!
-Cole!

876
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,781
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

877
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,181
God, come on!

878
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:30,787
Cole!

879
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,730
Oh, no, no!

880
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,961
Stay together.

881
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:46,135
Okay. I promise.
Now can we please go?

882
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,105
-Let's go.
-No problem. Okay, okay.

883
01:15:58,287 --> 01:15:59,811
Which way?

884
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:03,424
-I don't know.
-What?

885
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:05,685
What do you mean,
you don't know?

886
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:07,761
I found you, didn't l?

887
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,537
Tran?

888
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,772
Tran!

889
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:39,021
Tran!

890
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,397
Say something!

891
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:58,842
Oh, shit! Guys! Guys!

892
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,844
I can see light.

893
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,542
-ls there a way out?
-I don't know.

894
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,051
Cole!

895
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:09,280
Tran!

896
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,422
Can you hear me?

897
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:14,521
Cole!

898
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:17,124
Where are you?

899
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:33,007
I think I found a way out.

900
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:37,674
Take this. Go. Now.

901
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,255
-Where are they?
-Go.

902
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:43,386
Oh, my God.

903
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:44,923
Go.

904
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,329
-Help!
-Cole?

905
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,438
-Cole?
-Hey, right here!

906
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:02,369
Almost there.

907
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,904
Holy shit!

908
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,345
Move! It's coming up my ass!

909
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:12,681
Help me! What did I do?!

910
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:28,430
Where's Cole?

911
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:33,439
-Cole, come on!
-Cole! Come on!

912
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:36,307
-Give me your hand.
-Oh, God! I'm stuck!

913
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,469
-Give me your--
-I'm stuck! Pull me!

914
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,808
-Give me your arm!
-Hurry up! Come on!

915
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:44,750
Oh, my God! It's coming!
Let's go! Pull!

916
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,581
Pull!

917
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:07,303
That's what I'm talking about, Sam!

918
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:10,843
Oh, my God! You're the bomb, Sam!
You Lorena Bobbitt-ed that ass!

919
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:12,479
How you like her now, bitch?!

920
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:14,581
She sliced you, diced you,
cut you up!

921
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,479
Sam with the samurai action!

922
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:22,953
Hell, no.

923
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,361
Cole!

924
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:00,888
Get up, Cole. Get up, man.
Wake up, man.

925
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,029
Come on, man. Wake up.

926
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,894
No, no, no.

927
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:07,796
Cole. He's not breathing!

928
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:10,931
-He's got a pulse.
-Give him air!

929
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:12,334
Okay.

930
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,073
Again, again!

931
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:19,379
Come on, wake up!
Don't you die!

932
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,140
Don't die. Come on, no.

933
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:34,061
What the fuck?! Get it off me!

934
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:37,027
-No, no. It's okay! It's okay!
-Hey, it's okay.

935
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,530
It's me. Stay down.

936
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,133
-You're okay.
-I'm okay?

937
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:41,929
-Yeah.
-You're okay.

938
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:51,598
Perrinia immortalis.

939
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:16,119
-Son of a bitch finally got his orchid.
-Yeah. He can have them.

940
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:19,595
All I care about is that raft.

941
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:21,600
Let's go.

942
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:47,084
Oh, my God. Thank God.

943
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:06,545
I think I know what happened
to Mitchell.

944
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:12,113
I can't let you take that.

945
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,262
You guys look like hell.

946
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:26,891
-You don't know what hell is.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

947
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:29,935
-But you gave me no choice.
-Did you give Mitchell one...

948
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:32,665
-...before you killed him?
-I didn't kill Mitchell.

949
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,370
No...

950
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:36,200
...you just let him die.

951
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:39,070
I saw the spider bite
on his arm.

952
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,112
What was I supposed to do, Sam?

953
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:45,278
-The right thing?
-It's always a good place to start.

954
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:50,255
Let's not be stupid about this.

955
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:54,687
Let's get to the flower,
we can all go home.

956
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,461
The mating ball.

957
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:39,071
Give me the flare.

958
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:50,243
Tie him up.

959
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:52,150
Now!

960
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:11,632
-Fill it up.
-You've gotta be kidding me.

961
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:15,099
Do I look like I'm kidding?!
Fill it up!

962
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,636
Get up!

963
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:48,974
-Now get the flowers.
-Okay.

964
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,040
Throw me the pack.

965
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:36,722
Drop the gun!

966
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:45,694
Throw me the pack.

967
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:06,611
Get up, Bill! Get up!

968
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,093
Come on, man!

969
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:19,729
Get up!

970
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:26,905
Get up!

971
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:39,313
-Sam, come on!
-Sam! Come on!

972
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:41,478
-Come on, girl! Hurry up!
-Come on!

973
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:46,317
-Sam! Come on!
-Come on! Hurry up, Sam!

974
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:51,162
-Come on, baby!
-You got it, honey, come on!

975
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:54,796
Shit!

976
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,633
-Come on, baby.
-You got it!

977
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:00,000
-You got it, honey!
-Almost there! Come on!

978
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:04,669
-Spider....
-Reach for me!

979
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:07,872
Come on, Sam, please!
Just reach! Reach!

980
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:12,452
Give me your hand.

981
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:17,959
-Come on!
-Right here, Sam! Right here!

982
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,519
-Come on!
-Right here, Sam! Right here!

983
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,533
No! No! No!

984
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,009
No!

985
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:50,147
Oh, God!

986
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:56,492
Come on, Sam! Come on!

987
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,996
-Keep coming!
-Come on!

988
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:03,736
Climb up that wall, Sam!
Keep coming.

989
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,704
Come on, girl!

990
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,198
-Come on!
-Come on. I got you!

991
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,783
Come on, Sam, get back!

992
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:20,786
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

993
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:26,726
Hey!

994
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:28,191
Over here, bitch!

995
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:37,820
Holy shit.

996
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:48,867
Nice shot.

997
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:51,638
What can I say?

998
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:53,713
I'm a bad man.

999
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:26,647
You two look like you made up.

1000
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:29,213
He's not so bad.

1001
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:31,174
How's that?

1002
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:33,244
Much better.

1003
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:35,820
I think I'll live.

1004
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:37,218
Good.

1005
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:39,983
It's kind of nice having you around.

1006
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:46,889
-So how much further to my bath?
-Kotabaru?

1007
01:31:47,235 --> 01:31:49,032
I'd say...

1008
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:51,330
-...another day downriver.
-Another day?

1009
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,940
-I'm not rowing another day, homeboy.
-All right.

1010
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,576
Let's see, we got this shortcut
right up--

1011
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:58,371
No!

1012
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:40,617
