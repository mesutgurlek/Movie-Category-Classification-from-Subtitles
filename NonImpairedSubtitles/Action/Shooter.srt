00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:43,095
GUNNER

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,511
Approximately…

5
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:12,834
… 40 goats

6
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:16,518
They are not of any side.
We do not have to kill them.

7
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:18,780
Debit?

8
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:24,275
Primary, superficially secondary
by the way, tertiary by the river.

9
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:28,742
Nobody can rake to you
by the water, except a fish.

10
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,475
SARAH is going to begin
to study infirmary.

11
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,338
She herself cosio that.

12
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:45,616
He is very pretty.

13
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,762
Surely we came
to maintain La Paz?

14
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:53,740
Normally there is no peace
as a matter of principle of accounts.

15
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:57,686
This demaciado is calmed.

16
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:10,000
CAMPING OF I EXERCISE OF EUA LEMONIER
ETHIOPIA

17
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,606
These coordinates, no.
Dame an alternative.

18
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,543
Command post,
TS-129, change speaks.

19
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:21,064
I have visual confirmation
of the TS-129 position

20
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:24,771
Fulfilled mission, distance
on the verge of extraction: 8 km.

21
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:29,446
Control, I see forces friends

22
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,439
It alerts, estan there

23
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,494
Speech control, Atension.

24
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:38,028
Hostile forces approaching
to TS-129 to its 12 of the clock.

25
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,198
Target.

26
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,460

Vehicle, machine gun.

29
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:46,546
Distance?

30
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:53,035
798 meters and approaching.

31
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:56,631
Wind, value 3/4
left pushes 2.

32
00:03:57,722 --> 00:04:00,712
810 meters.
Wide point of the way.

33
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:03,501
I have to the target.

34
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:04,611
In the sight.

35
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,433
Fire to discresion.

36
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:10,982
Acercate.

37
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:19,699
Control, speaks Viper.
Incapacitated hostile threat.

38
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,220
Viper, speaks Control.
We received communication. Change.

39
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,180
It is hour to go away.

40
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:38,648
Viper speaks.
Fulfilled mission, empacando.

41
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:42,473
Hostile but great forces
approaching its Brave sector.

42
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:44,956
Deberia not to have
enemies so close.

43
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:56,439
Crooked tree. 608 meters,
45 km/h, 3 mils ahead.

44
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:05,232
Estan shooting one
machine gun. 810 ms, value 3/4.

45
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,485
Fire at will.

46
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,182
Head. 9-2-0, value 3/4.

47
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:16,855
I see it, Don, I see it.

48
00:05:16,856 --> 00:05:17,997
Fire at will.

49
00:05:27,104 --> 00:05:29,304
- They do not know where we are!
- They can have luck!

50
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:36,035
Control speaks Viper. We stopped
enemy forces. Respond.

51
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,814
Friends follow point
of extraction. Repondan.

52
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:42,931
We are receiving fire
of hostile troops. Respond.

53
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:47,146
Control, hears to me?

54
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,857
Cut already.

55
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:52,589
They are men very trained
8 km inside of a neutral country.

56
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:54,836
They are going away to be able to escape.
Cut already.

57
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,161
They listen to me?

58
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,044
Vamonos finish and!

59
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:01,393
Review the things and you empaquen.

60
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,661
Nondeberiamos to have air support!

61
00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:16,772
Llama to the base!

62
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:21,626
Excrement!

63
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:22,556
The channel does not serve!

64
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:24,065
Impossible!

65
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:25,628
The connection is dead!

66
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:28,449
They left us here.
Calm, we are going to arrive at house!

67
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,380
Donnie!

68
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,419
Donnie!

69
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:19,670
36 MONTHS LATER

70
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:45,512
They see boy!

71
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:48,243
They see Sam!

72
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:52,265
That beams? That these doing?

73
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:55,256
I do not have anything. That?

74
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,860
Good, Vamonos, Vamonos.

75
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:02,892
Thus I like.

76
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:06,304
It advanced.

77
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:17,212
Very well.

78
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,372
To see that lies
they estan to us today selling.

79
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,147
Taking, small dog.

80
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,893
You are a good small dog.

81
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:35,567
LANGLEY, VIRGINIA

82
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:46,694
Sergeant of artillery
Bob Lee Swagger.

83
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:51,037
Marines. Retired.
The nobody is best one than.

84
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,356
His it completes mission finished bad.

85
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:56,604
We lent it and
they left in hostile land.

86
00:09:56,605 --> 00:10:00,637
The opposite force commanded
a elicoptero and one hundred men.

87
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,947
Murio its better friend
and surveyor.

88
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:05,080
There is no official report.

89
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:09,174
According to espionage report, it inflicted
70% of losses. The others fled.

90
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,111
The agent who left it
there to die?

91
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,186
Erasure of the face of
Earth to the two weeks.

92
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,627
They never accused Bob Lee.

93
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,578
One week retired later.

94
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:21,745
Bob Lee not
he considered prescindible.

95
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,568
He cultivates and he kills his food.

96
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,508
If, rare time leaves.

97
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:40,583
This he is a man with one
History of having and patritismo.

98
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:43,369
Not of joke but
as firm beliefs.

99
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,319
Some do not know that to do
when its system of beliefs falls.

100
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,785
Bob Lee is one of those.

101
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:03,056
Surely, boy?

102
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,363
No, I am not going it to buy.
I do not want anything.

103
00:11:18,364 --> 00:11:21,548
Return to the place
from that they came.

104
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:24,793
Bob Lee Swagger?

105
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:29,446
I am colonel Isaac Johnson.
It is difficult to find it.

106
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:30,891
Not sufficient it.

107
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:34,836
I came from distant spot to see it.
subjects require his atension.

108
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:37,978
Return in second
or they failed the brakes to them.

109
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:39,642
They see here, small dog.

110
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:44,539
It does not call it. If one approaches
house tendra that to kill the dog.

111
00:11:46,682 --> 00:11:49,357
It does not unholster fast.
That wants?

112
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:52,446
If it kills it, you
it will finish buried here.

113
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,473
Him diree to the bailiff
month later. It understands.

114
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:57,681
Loose your weapon.

115
00:11:57,682 --> 00:12:01,978
Slowly. So that the sergeant
he does not have enterrarte.

116
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:07,514
I am disarmed.

117
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:12,157
He knows what is that?

118
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:15,889
The medal of Honor.
They do not give them easily.

119
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,627
She is yours?

120
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:18,654
If

121
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,647
Its father tapeworm one, No?

122
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:21,884
That he did?

123
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:25,631
A triviality. I did not leave
that other boys died.

124
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,229
He can give 5 minutes me?

125
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:32,222
Its dog remains outside.

126
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,990
Small dog enters.

127
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:39,568
I need that plané
a presidential murder.

128
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,082
Of as president?

129
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,280
Of ours.

130
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,422
I did not say executes. Plané.

131
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,308
So that that happens.

132
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,613
They tried to assassinate it in
next the 2 weeks.

133
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:58,870
We deciphered one
anonymous transmission.

134
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,168
She was internal.

135
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:03,906
we cannot go
to the normal agencies.

136
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:06,782
The government has been infiltrated.

137
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:12,549
The precidente has three
appearances you publish in that time.

138
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,697
In Baltimore, Filadelfia
and Washington, D.C.

139
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:22,963
The protective cord of the Service
Secret arrives at 800 meters.

140
00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:27,249
The official notice says that him
they shot of but of 1600 M.s

141
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,970
We needed that it says to us
that haria to stop it.

142
00:13:32,971 --> 00:13:38,613
I am not sure that
shot like that podria to guess right…

143
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:41,622
… but we do not want to risk to us.

144
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:45,339
Nobody confirmed its shots
but long.

145
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,170
Many long tieros go to places
where it does not agree to you to go to confirm.

146
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:52,892
The confirmation is
problem of bureaucrats.

147
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:56,571
It knows what it is needed
in order to guess right of so far?

148
00:13:56,572 --> 00:14:01,328
Everything enters game: humidity,
temperature, wind and but.

149
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:04,602
The bullet takes of 6 to 10 seconds,
you shoot to where it is going to be.

150
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:07,642
Until the rotation of
the Earth enters game.

151
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:11,208
It will bring armor, has
to give him in the head.

152
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:13,858
There is some gunner
able to give him?

153
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,171
If.

154
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:17,794
Then they have
to find the gunner

155
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:20,085
Somebody but is
working in that.

156
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:21,898
We needed that You do this.

157
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,389
I do not like much the precidente.
The previous one either I did not like.

158
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,591
It likes that is president,
to live in a free country?

159
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:33,223
We left
killers govern to us?

160
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:34,347
Some years, if.

161
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:40,037
I believe that it was stopped before one
flag and swore solemnly…

162
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:44,822
… to support and to defend
the Constitution of the EUA…

163
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:48,343
… against all the enemies
foreigner and domestic servants

164
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,488
Their 5 minutes already finished.

165
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:01,489
Escuchame, son.

166
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:08,594
I do not want that articles the TV
and you see the dead precidente…

167
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:11,909
… knowing that
podias to have avoided.

168
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,085
You do not become that.

169
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:36,860
It is the new model?

170
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:38,536
The car

171
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:41,520
It has the great motor?

172
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:45,242
Watch that.
a V-8 of eight liters.

173
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:48,896
It is so great that the government
it does not say whichever km gives by liter.

174
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:52,021
I can take a photo him?

175
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:54,498
That beautiful

176
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,156
Somebody will answer this
teleefono, day and night.

177
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:08,118
They saw it? It did not need
a photo of the motor.

178
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,897
It does not concern the motor to him.
It knows of counterespionage.

179
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:15,338
One lay down for back and
it photographed the plates.

180
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:16,850
He is the indicated one.

181
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,701
One did not refuse?

182
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:21,992
It said that yes,
but still it does not know it.

183
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,065
They are 1,6 km.

184
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:42,291
It is far.
Must worry the president?

185
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:16,222
But bond that worries.

186
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,379
It is going to be well.

187
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:37,166
It eats once to the day. Leele tables
of ballistics if one feels single.

188
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,904
If, Outside.

189
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:42,353
They see, friend.

190
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:43,724
Good.

191
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:47,981
You are going to hold
days without my?

192
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,590
Command post speech.
Cuáll is its situation?

193
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:21,240
We are finishing in street 6.

194
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:24,543
Understood. We established
inspection point.

195
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:42,050
The building of independence
where the EUA were born.

196
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:45,534
One of the buildings more
important in the EUA history.

197
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,670
Constructed in 1732.

198
00:20:47,671 --> 00:20:50,557
You have visual contact
with the 72 floor?

199
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:52,507
Until the railing that.

200
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,966
Of the 3 cities, single it has
one with success possibilities.

201
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,759
Baltimore is no place.

202
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,774
The street does not allow to do
corrections to see it.

203
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:13,414
DC. is a suicidal mission.

204
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:17,889
If its gunner does not love 70 virgins
in the other life, descártelo.

205
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,821
They will shoot to him in “Fili”.
Of more far than 1620 M.s

206
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:27,225
There is 1 of 6 possible locations,
5 floors above of the president.

207
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:30,049
The flight time of
the bullet will be 5-6 seconds.

208
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,488
They must wait for a
that its speech begins.

209
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:35,775
Quiet and it will be very exposed.

210
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:37,679
The weapon must be of high caliber.

211
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,308
A done bullet by hand,
bronze alloy.

212
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:45,540
Low ballistic coefficient,
very slippery, that would do I.

213
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,766
It can kill of so far?

214
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:52,732
The bullet would give him with more
force that a Magnum. 44.

215
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,605
It could kill.

216
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:56,855
The challenge is the wind.

217
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:59,649
The slightest breeze without
to correct can ruin the shot.

218
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,596
It will need indicators between
podio and position

219
00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:07,178
The speed is corrected,
changes of angle

220
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:09,023
Mentally fast.

221
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:12,070
Without measurers
it cannot guess right to first

222
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:14,785
An impressive study, son

223
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:17,033
We must have patience.

224
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:18,945
We want to take hold it alive.

225
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:22,044
If we do not know who
it contracted, is possible to be repeated.

226
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:28,044
We will have 6 equipment
of 3 ready men.

227
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:30,520
Sergeant Swagger?

228
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:31,774
A little while?

229
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:37,201
You lent a great one to him
service to your country, son. The day…

230
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:43,645
Sight. Tuu you are one of the few
people who know that to look for.

231
00:22:43,646 --> 00:22:45,646
I need a surveyor.

232
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,066
Thanks, Filadelfia.

233
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,394
The president goes a
to speak in 20 min.

234
00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:02,065
That the equipment
verify his positions.

235
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:07,503
Sennor?

236
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:11,242
… and a country, the EUA,
that it changed the world.

237
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,184
Filadelfia is nuesto home.

238
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,363
Attention, speaks
listening post.

239
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:18,774
Lantern approaches
to point Jackson.

240
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:21,808
Snipers,
report his situation.

241
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:25,663
If, I know clearly Vista.

242
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:34,491
Understood.

243
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:36,404
Position 18, cleared.

244
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:38,901
Position 19, reports.
As it is his situation?

245
00:24:38,902 --> 00:24:42,840
Everything cleared,
Here there is nothing.

246
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:47,248
The presindente will grant
the brotherhood medal…

247
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,410
It has been criticizing
the atrocities in its country.

248
00:24:56,411 --> 00:25:00,445
It glides to meet with the presindente
later to speak of this.

249
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:02,980
This is a huge time.

250
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:05,885
This is an historical time.

251
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:09,598
And this is also,
a problematic time.

252
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,653
This medal that its country…

253
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:15,099
Amarrillos strips.

254
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,636
They are for remembering the troops.

255
00:25:17,637 --> 00:25:22,256
No, those go down, around
of trees. They are wind flags.

256
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:25,633
Where I would put them
in order to throw of the bell tower.

257
00:25:25,634 --> 00:25:27,593
If. Perhaps.

258
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:30,007
Without a doubt. It knows what does.

259
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:31,008
It has an equipment
for the church?

260
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:35,098
They will act before shoots,
when it is aiming.

261
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:38,556
… and it confronts the freedom…

262
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:43,957
… but subtly
the asphyxia in its root.

263
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,785
And it is our responsibility…

264
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:50,565
… to find those grass dark…

265
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:55,444
Lantern already arrived.
I repeat. Lantern arrived.

266
00:25:55,445 --> 00:26:02,335
Timmons official,
our local resource.

267
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:06,446
Bob Lee Swagger.

268
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:08,896
It is an honor to know it…

269
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:13,508
The insurance of the weapon is cleared

270
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:14,966
Excrement, carajo.

271
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:16,773
He would be bad to lose my pistol.

272
00:26:16,774 --> 00:26:18,912
Again, it is an honor.

273
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:28,958
The one of the neck is ours?

274
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,160
He is the archbishop of Ethiopia.

275
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:33,572
They are giving the medal him.
You know it?

276
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:35,535
The horn of Africa. If

277
00:26:35,536 --> 00:26:37,298
I also worked there.

278
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:41,530
That he is first that
you feel when killing a civilian?

279
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:43,429
Culetazo of rifle?

280
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,582
That original.

281
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:49,198
Thanks to inspire to us
with its words.

282
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,777
The president is going to speak.

283
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,169
All the equipment, ready.

284
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:58,887
Agent Gibson, we received
its report. Everything cleared.

285
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:00,877
Agent James, everything cleared.

286
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:05,187
I have wind to 3,
complete value

287
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:09,664
They are going to be 4 1/2 minutes
of angle.

288
00:27:09,665 --> 00:27:12,046
Three mils of adjustment
in case the wind stops

289
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:36,616
It already loaded.

290
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:40,880
Height, humidity,
temperature, seizures in counts.

291
00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:44,831
In the city that was the capital…

292
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,222
It is necessary to kill it.

293
00:27:46,223 --> 00:27:47,974
10 seconds.

294
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:50,446
The wind is exact.
Shoot to him!

295
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:52,589
Command to the equipment!
Eliminate…

296
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,881
Firings! Firings!

297
00:27:57,882 --> 00:28:13,987
Lantern is in the floor!

298
00:28:13,988 --> 00:28:16,047
That?
Lantern is in the floor?

299
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:18,378
They hurt the president!

300
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:19,446
There is much confusion.

301
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,434
They hurt the president?

302
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:25,710
In the bell tower.

303
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:30,398
As you failed?

304
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,019
As you could fail?

305
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,176
30 seconds.
Clear the quarter. Persecute it.

306
00:28:36,177 --> 00:28:37,887
This bleeding. Matenlo.

307
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:42,171
Command post
to Condor 2, they load.

308
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:43,573
Condor 2 loading.

309
00:28:46,728 --> 00:28:49,950
Apurense, we go!

310
00:28:54,753 --> 00:28:55,836
Apurense, boys.

311
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:11,383
Condor 2, preparense
in order to receive information.

312
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:12,875
Prepared, change.

313
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:16,527
Control!

314
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:19,852
Control, Put speech 19!
They listen to me?

315
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,181
I remain here?

316
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:23,464
Please ayudenme!
They gave a shot me!

317
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:25,613
FBI, above the hands!

318
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,137
They shot to me.

319
00:29:30,138 --> 00:29:31,138
- They shot to Me.
- That?

320
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,714
Dame your keys.

321
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:42,976
I did not kill the president.
It was a trap.

322
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,180
Auxilo!

323
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:49,916
One took to my car and my weapon!

324
00:29:55,216 --> 00:29:57,371
It neglects, already I gave two shots him.
You are well?

325
00:29:57,372 --> 00:30:01,872
Description can repeat
of the suspect?

326
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:02,873
Negative, I do not have nothing else.

327
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:06,698
It speaks 15,
here there is no activity.

328
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:08,663
I am available if it is necessary.

329
00:30:08,664 --> 00:30:09,988
Understood

330
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:17,282
The Timmons official requests support

331
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,253
I am persecuting the suspect

332
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:22,492
It is fleeing in vehicle of FBI
robbed, to the south, in Front de Diamond.

333
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:26,397
The suspect is arming
and he is dangerous. I repeat.

334
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:28,467
Police of Filadelfia:

335
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:31,786
I suspect murder
fleeing in vehicle of FBI.

336
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:34,496
It goes to the south,
on Front de Diamond

337
00:30:34,497 --> 00:30:37,607
Cóndor 2 speaks.
In transition of Front.

338
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:40,274
Denos description
additional of the vehicle

339
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:42,934
Dispatcher, 4-19
I go to the south in Thompson.

340
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:45,356
We are the warm
or something of the vehicle?

341
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:47,968
We do not have the color.

342
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:50,617
Possibly he is sedán.

343
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:52,525
Control to all the units:

344
00:30:52,526 --> 00:30:57,786
The vehicle is a Ford Crown Vic
2006, black one, of the government.

345
00:30:57,787 --> 00:30:59,605
Plates of Pensilvania:

346
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:04,551
7-3-1-7-James
David-Edward Change.

347
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:06,756
UUltima location
well-known of the suspect?

348
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:09,250
Going to the south on Front.

349
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:37,470
Timmons reported it?

350
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:39,554
Just in time, as it had.

351
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:40,774
Before giving another shot him.

352
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:41,964
It has two wounded ones.

353
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:45,204
If it cannot stop the bled one,
it is not going to matter.

354
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:49,998
They will find dead in
callegon in 20 minutes.

355
00:31:49,999 --> 00:32:25,084
Witnesses report vehicle
entering the washing of cars…

356
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:28,785
… in corner NE
of Gerard and the 9.

357
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:32,503
Cóndor 2 goes way a
location of the suspect.

358
00:32:32,504 --> 00:32:35,033
Cóndor 3 listened.
All in way.

359
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,316
Excrement!

360
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:22,701
Cóndores 2 and 3
moving to intercept.

361
00:33:55,404 --> 00:33:59,404
Vehicle of the suspect hit
camioon in Market and Columbus.

362
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:05,646
Vehicle is disabled.
I repeat: disabled vehicle.

363
00:34:15,502 --> 00:34:17,464
- Manten it
- Fire, fire!

364
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:45,330
I found a Crown Vic, black,
plates of the government.

365
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,594
There is a dead in the front?

366
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:55,099
I want monitoring in 50 km
of these shores, for 5 minutes.

367
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,373
Begin to look for river down.

368
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,765
I am with Timmons agent,
that persiguó to the suspect on foot.

369
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:07,673
The assassin, who is
identified like…

370
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:10,971
… sagento of armory
Bob Lee Swagger…

371
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:13,077
… he is persecuted by thousands…

372
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,784
… of state officials
federals.

373
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:20,863
… The network is continued narrowing,
but Swagger does not appear.

374
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:25,130
Single they found a car
at heart of the Delaware river.

375
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:29,213
A veteran police
of Filadelfia, Stanley Timmons…

376
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:33,350
… first which it arrived at the scene,
apparently it hurt to Swagger.

377
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:38,857
The first reports indicate
that the attacker received two shots.

378
00:37:38,858 --> 00:37:44,607
While, the police comments on
the fact that an agent his…

379
00:37:44,608 --> 00:37:48,159
… it was attacked and disarmed
by Swagger while it fled…

380
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,646
… possibly in
a vehicle of FBI.

381
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:54,576
Until now
there is sign of no Swagger,

382
00:37:54,577 --> 00:37:57,036
You have shamed to us.

383
00:37:57,037 --> 00:38:01,113
The office of Responsibility
Professional will review your case.

384
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,857
Sir…

385
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:05,552
I do not feel ashamed.

386
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:08,016
A sniper escapes ahead
of the noses…

387
00:38:08,017 --> 00:38:08,850
… disarmed
left the academy.

388
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:10,858
… he confirmed to me just
left the Academy.

389
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,922
I feel that I have
luck to be alive.

390
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:24,129
so that it said that
it did not kill the president?

391
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,368
Because it did not kill it.

392
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:31,362
Tembién said that
Timmons was a trap.

393
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:33,269
It never said that.

394
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,994
A police hurt to the type,
To you they left the face to you

395
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:41,197
Affluent nonmemory. It is normal
in cases of extreme stress.

396
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:44,932
You already did your
official declaration?

397
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:47,978
I whom your, it would have
taken care of with which it said.

398
00:38:47,979 --> 00:38:52,036
Better I hope that it arises suddenly
I read it and then I decide to me.

399
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:57,888
Exactly.

400
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:01,535
The takings already come from TV.

401
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:21,866
In a surprising turn,
security cameras…

402
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:25,049
of Washintong DC.
and several places in Filadelfia…

403
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,429
… they show the suspect,
sergeant Swagger…

404
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:32,140
… esplorando locations
in order to shoot, measuring the wind.

405
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:37,392
While the wall is narrowed,
not yet there are the news of Swagger.

406
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,021
Excuse.

407
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:11,156
Him I cannot sell nothing.
I do not have light.

408
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:12,904
I have cash, I do not want change

409
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:15,000
It is not going to be able to find nothing.

410
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:18,732
Single I need a syringe
in order to marinar, salt, sugar and water.

411
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:21,454
Whichever bottles?

412
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,248
The moan. Moan to hear that.

413
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:13,110
Surely she is a woman
very good Christian…

414
00:41:13,111 --> 00:41:16,480
… but here not us
we ordered of that.

415
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:20,020
If, good, it goes with
a married advisor.

416
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:23,872
With the Dr Phil or somebody.

417
00:41:23,873 --> 00:41:28,699
The agents tracked the prairie
of the Wina river in Wyroming…

418
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,936
… where Swagger takes
living several years.

419
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:35,077
Meanwhile,
FBI does not want to speak…

420
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:37,838
… and there are signs of no Swagger.

421
00:41:38,857 --> 00:41:39,865
You have something?

422
00:42:42,742 --> 00:42:44,497
Where he was this?

423
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:57,982
and?

424
00:42:57,983 --> 00:43:01,235
Think that he was he, but no
it knows well because the light went away.

425
00:43:01,236 --> 00:43:02,804
What bought?

426
00:43:02,805 --> 00:43:05,344
Salt, sugar, water,
and a syringe to marinar.

427
00:43:05,345 --> 00:43:07,015
The type went to roasting.

428
00:43:07,016 --> 00:43:11,021
Salt, water and a syringe can be used
for a sounding. But the sugar?

429
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,414
A little while!

430
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:15,199
The sugar is used
in order to treat wounded.

431
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,250
By the osmótica pressure. They used it
at the time of Napoleon.

432
00:43:19,251 --> 00:43:23,842
If you speak to him to Howard of
Napoleón, commands to you with a psychologist

433
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:26,753
Veto to work.
I saved the life to you.

434
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:49,194
A thing this cla…

435
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:59,272
… 90 to 1800. A thing is cla…

436
00:43:59,273 --> 00:44:21,974
Winning It wins Wimbledon

437
00:45:15,842 --> 00:45:17,183
Excuse the annoyance, lady.

438
00:45:17,211 --> 00:45:18,587
I who am.

439
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:21,387
She is Bob Lee,
the compannero of Donnie.

440
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:23,995
I watch, I did not kill the president.

441
00:45:23,996 --> 00:45:25,516
Already.

442
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:26,566
Really?

443
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:30,125
The president is not dead.
The archbishop of Ethiopia, if.

444
00:45:32,305 --> 00:45:34,002
So that devils killed it?

445
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,818
You are nurse, no?

446
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:40,651
No, that was suenno of Donnie.
I do not hold the blood.

447
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:43,177
Ensenno to 3er. anno.

448
00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:43,952
Please.

449
00:45:43,953 --> 00:45:44,749
Deberia to go to me.

450
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,064
Please!

451
00:45:47,065 --> 00:45:51,220
I did not do what they say.
The right of perpetual ownership.

452
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:55,636
I am in messes I need aid.
I did not come so far to lie to him.

453
00:46:00,192 --> 00:46:01,716
Still it wants to me to kill?

454
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:06,138
It is difficult to use
that gun fast.

455
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:09,377
If it is going it to do, hagalo already.

456
00:46:09,378 --> 00:46:11,360
I do not have any
another place to where to go.

457
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:17,720
It puts the car in the garage.
The neighboring ones already are going to wake up.

458
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:19,830
Llamame Sarah.

459
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:21,200
This good.

460
00:46:36,749 --> 00:46:38,387
9-1-1,
As it is his emergency?

461
00:47:09,235 --> 00:47:10,847
It speaks 9-1-1.
We received a call that hung.

462
00:47:10,848 --> 00:47:14,014
The dog of the neighbor fell down
the sweepings and frightened to me.

463
00:47:14,015 --> 00:47:15,774
Everything is well. Thanks.

464
00:47:22,744 --> 00:47:25,852
If flames to the police
and you hang without saying nothing…

465
00:47:25,853 --> 00:47:27,736
… they call to you immediately

466
00:47:34,157 --> 00:47:35,762
Deberia to have come
in person.

467
00:47:39,862 --> 00:47:41,880
Before. I say, then.

468
00:47:41,881 --> 00:47:43,182
Law the letter.

469
00:47:43,183 --> 00:47:46,817
It was well.

470
00:47:46,818 --> 00:47:51,072
And once to anno
receipt the flowers.

471
00:47:53,712 --> 00:47:55,160
You do not see yourself very well.

472
00:47:56,844 --> 00:47:59,727
Deberia to be dead.
It was one night long.

473
00:48:00,704 --> 00:48:01,732
So that you did not die?

474
00:48:01,733 --> 00:48:06,676
The government invirtio time and
money in ensennar to me to survive…

475
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:09,668
… after ensennar to me
to kill people.

476
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:12,982
As you want that it helps you?

477
00:48:12,983 --> 00:48:17,853
You know to embroider with point
of cross and to make knots?

478
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:19,820
If.

479
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:33,419
It buys the things in several sides.
Rare side if purchases all together.

480
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:38,303
1 package of Surgical Gloves
2 Alcohol Bottles

481
00:48:42,363 --> 00:48:45,035
As it could be does
3 annos when they seem 10?

482
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,700
The life can be heavy.

483
00:49:02,282 --> 00:49:04,126
Nobody arrives before I.

484
00:49:11,236 --> 00:49:12,634
You never were yourself.

485
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,269
All they said to me that I am crazy.

486
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,828
That not what I saw,
or that not oi what oi.

487
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:22,077
I am not crazy.
Your you think that I am crazy?

488
00:49:23,631 --> 00:49:25,561
Where it left all this?

489
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:29,432
First I thought that of Washington
of Quantico

490
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:33,433
I paid attention and it is not thus.
It arrived… by magic art.

491
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:38,067
The agencies like ATF, the NRO,
other that they do not have nor initial…

492
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:41,230
… they cooperate at moments
of emergency national.

493
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:42,647
You need to sleep.

494
00:49:42,648 --> 00:49:47,463
The first diagram of ballistics
it arrived 22 minutes after the shot.

495
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:48,707
We are good.

496
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:52,701
12 minutes after the shot
nobody tapeworm access to the scene.

497
00:49:52,702 --> 00:49:56,954
As they obtained an azimuth
spent 10 minutes later?

498
00:49:56,955 --> 00:50:00,139
We worked for the government,
we are not so good.

499
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,248
- You want to see something?
- Probablemante no.

500
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,441
I lowered this.

501
00:50:03,442 --> 00:50:07,496
It is a reproduction of a target
that Swagger used, to 900 meters.

502
00:50:08,194 --> 00:50:11,231
I did the holes to him.
He was in a competition.

503
00:50:11,232 --> 00:50:15,377
Law an article that decia that Swagger
it gave to a dollar of silver 900 M.s

504
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:22,788
5 shots to 900 M.s All diron
in an extension of 3.75 cm

505
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,038
That is the flag behind
president, as soon as moving.

506
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:33,102
Wind speed,
according to the meteorological service.

507
00:50:33,103 --> 00:50:34,355
I made numbers.

508
00:50:34,356 --> 00:50:37,352
As a man can
with this aim…

509
00:50:37,353 --> 00:50:42,875
… to fail by 75 cm a
1800 meters? I do not understand.

510
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:45,571
You had one night long.
Veto to sleep.

511
00:50:45,572 --> 00:50:48,083
I saw the interview of Timmons.

512
00:50:48,084 --> 00:50:53,122
It said that was patrolling on foot,
it saw leave rifle a window.

513
00:50:53,123 --> 00:50:55,700
It raised to investigate e
it hurt to Swagger.

514
00:50:55,701 --> 00:50:58,668
No gunner removes
rifle by the window.

515
00:50:58,669 --> 00:51:02,743
They shoot prote'ge's, from
the quarter. It does not have sense.

516
00:51:05,568 --> 00:51:07,259
I am going to speak with Timmons.

517
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,726
They are going to me to dismiss?

518
00:51:08,727 --> 00:51:13,602
A thief killed Timmons
in a alley last night.

519
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:19,060
In all plot they cut
the loose ends.

520
00:51:20,065 --> 00:51:21,382
Jack Ruby kills Oswald?

521
00:51:21,383 --> 00:51:24,044
To good people
they pass bad things to him.

522
00:51:24,045 --> 00:51:25,365
Not so fast.

523
00:51:25,366 --> 00:51:35,999
I stopped the bled one so far
But one is going away to untie again.

524
00:51:36,796 --> 00:51:39,918
Avoid the advance of the infection
but you are going to have to open it…

525
00:51:39,919 --> 00:51:42,054
… to enlarge and to clear dead weave.

526
00:51:43,246 --> 00:51:46,017
You work of the center for outside
you sew the wounds and…

527
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:48,613
… it deals with not returning to infect it.

528
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,486
These list?

529
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:57,312
I am going to inhale I oxidize
nitrous and to desmayar to me.

530
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:02,200
Good luck, if?

531
00:53:16,538 --> 00:53:19,752
I need that plané
presidential murder.

532
00:53:19,753 --> 00:53:21,334
The one of the neck is ours?

533
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:22,438
Of as president?

534
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:23,967
I did not say executes.

535
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:26,776
They estan giving the medal to him.
It knows it?

536
00:53:26,777 --> 00:53:29,100
The archbishop of Ethiopia.

537
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,378
Two days and means and no
there is sign? Ecuentren something.

538
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:39,006
Perhaps one put in
a hole and died.

539
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:41,856
He is not dead.

540
00:55:44,018 --> 00:55:45,080
Investigate its life.

541
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:46,313
Again.

542
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,524
Everything came out well?

543
00:55:58,636 --> 00:55:59,886
It was hallucinated.

544
00:56:02,801 --> 00:56:04,542
I need decirte something.

545
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:08,953
Ralphie this dead.

546
00:56:09,942 --> 00:56:10,898
Who is Ralphie?

547
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:15,783
They say that you killed your dog
because wise that you were not going to return.

548
00:56:15,784 --> 00:56:16,950
That said?

549
00:56:21,627 --> 00:56:22,882
Sam was called.

550
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:26,522
A good dog.
I raised it from puppy.

551
00:56:30,943 --> 00:56:32,324
These good?

552
00:56:36,072 --> 00:56:37,416
That you are going to do?

553
00:56:39,224 --> 00:56:40,535
I am going away to heal.

554
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,616
Then I will burn
its house of munnecas.

555
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,010
That weapon system
it uses a tripod…

556
00:56:53,011 --> 00:56:56,057
… with legs of
107 xs 107 xs 72 cm?

557
00:57:04,332 --> 00:57:08,377
M-3. It serves for many arms,
until for machine guns lime 50.

558
00:57:08,378 --> 00:57:11,499
So that they pondrian a cable to him
of 100 meters…

559
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,194
… of 65 mm to that system?

560
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:22,519
I can help him?

561
00:57:27,947 --> 00:57:29,855
See here:
www.remotosprecision.com

562
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:44,202
Tactical system to Remote Control

563
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:52,588
You do not move.

564
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:05,580
Queria preguntarte something.

565
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:08,034
You have fiancè?

566
00:58:10,415 --> 00:58:11,484
So that?

567
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,035
Still I must be the mourning widow?

568
00:58:15,036 --> 00:58:16,805
They already passed three annos.

569
00:58:16,806 --> 00:58:20,303
Queria to know if
debia to kill somebody…

570
00:58:20,304 --> 00:58:22,521
… that entered by
that door without touching

571
00:58:25,474 --> 00:58:27,135
Then, no.

572
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:30,223
I do not have fiancè, nothing serious.

573
00:58:54,294 --> 00:58:55,102
He is not bad.

574
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:58,092
A little hard, but…

575
00:59:02,114 --> 00:59:04,472
You had been
good nurse.

576
00:59:06,284 --> 00:59:09,615
You were very brave.
You saved the life to me.

577
00:59:13,665 --> 00:59:15,631
but bond that empiese.

578
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:18,336
They never left of perseguirte.

579
00:59:20,005 --> 00:59:20,926
Never.

580
00:59:20,927 --> 00:59:23,852
They never left of buscarte.

581
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:30,919
I am going to give to them to.

582
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,919
Pardon?

583
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,838
Perhaps it manages to kill
two birds of a shot.

584
00:59:57,147 --> 00:59:59,102
Rifle with which
Donnie aprendio to hunt.

585
01:00:01,752 --> 01:00:04,799
It is not great thing
but it shoots right.

586
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,583
I cleaned it and I oiled
before keeping it.

587
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:08,740
These safe?

588
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:10,711
If.

589
01:00:13,597 --> 01:00:15,559
So that you acceded?

590
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,580
When they came to verte?

591
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:22,311
Bellboys know that to tighten.

592
01:00:22,755 --> 01:00:26,506
I am a clown, you tighten
patriotism button and I say:

593
01:00:26,507 --> 01:00:28,785
“ For where they want that he goes”

594
01:00:28,786 --> 01:00:33,839
I am not very proud of that
but shamed either.

595
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:38,980
I have a plan. But I create
that I am going to need your aid.

596
01:00:39,443 --> 01:00:40,903
Good, hare.

597
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:44,684
I have not said to you of that he consists.

598
01:00:44,929 --> 01:00:45,909
Already.

599
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,180
Sight.

600
01:00:55,711 --> 01:00:57,011
It was my fault.

601
01:00:59,737 --> 01:01:00,277
That?

602
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:06,830
With Donnie never deberia…

603
01:01:13,476 --> 01:01:14,016
that?

604
01:01:19,862 --> 01:01:21,162
You do not dare

605
01:01:23,426 --> 01:01:25,886
You do not try to clear that to him.

606
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,573
The right wise person what was
doing when I enlist myself.

607
01:01:31,574 --> 01:01:36,994
Wise person which towards when
they trained it like sniper.

608
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:39,318
It enchanted to him what towards.

609
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:41,939
Nadoe forced it to do it.

610
01:01:43,493 --> 01:01:45,873
You cannot load with that.

611
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,167
This good

612
01:01:51,982 --> 01:01:53,842

This good.

614
01:02:25,383 --> 01:02:27,795
It sees see an agent of FBI

That they do not take hold to you,
if they take hold to you, they take hold to me.

619
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:41,198
Sabes that he is this?

620
01:02:42,694 --> 01:02:45,656
It says that I do not kill
to nobody, but not.

621
01:02:45,657 --> 01:02:47,211
This remaining with me.

622
01:02:47,212 --> 01:02:50,772
That this with you?
Bob Lee Swagger?

623
01:02:57,744 --> 01:03:01,674
The plates have to be false
The other I number is real.

624
01:03:01,675 --> 01:03:02,864
That is this?

625

I number of the vehicle
Nobody is bothered in changing it.

626
01:03:07,832 --> 01:03:12,272
You are going away to be well quiet
until it goes to me.

627
01:03:42,287 --> 01:03:45,207

633
01:05:19,403 --> 01:05:20,403
Hello John.

634
01:05:23,672 --> 01:05:25,852
SINGLE AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL

635
01:05:39,209 --> 01:05:43,909
I journey reports that no
there are plates with that I number.

636
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:50,268
IT REQUIRES LEVEL OF
AUTHORIZATION LEVEL 1

637
01:05:50,269 --> 01:05:53,334
Tienes many desire of knowing?
Because they can dismiss to you.

638
01:05:53,335 --> 01:05:56,975
I must appear
before the office…

639
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,045
… of Professional Responsibility
in 45 minutes.

640
01:06:01,046 --> 01:06:04,812
They are going to me to dismiss,
that no longer worries to me

641
01:06:04,813 --> 01:06:05,973
That you think?

642
01:06:07,913 --> 01:06:10,608
That Cnn recibio the tapes
before we.

643
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:13,048
Already published it stops
to show the angles.

644
01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:14,433
That I give them?

645
01:06:14,434 --> 01:06:17,451
An anonymous agency
that it does not confirm it nor denies it.

646
01:06:17,452 --> 01:06:20,592
They denied it, which is one with…

647
01:06:21,985 --> 01:06:25,417
Which is a species of confirmation.

648
01:06:25,418 --> 01:06:26,258
Of which?

649
01:06:27,456 --> 01:06:30,771
These asking things
outside your level of payment.

650
01:06:30,772 --> 01:06:31,932
Single it tell me…

651
01:06:32,135 --> 01:06:33,814
It does not agree to you to appear

652
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:38,315
Not only they can despedirte
but levantarte positions.

653
01:06:46,242 --> 01:06:50,482
The work of my head
it has that authorization.

654
01:06:52,914 --> 01:06:53,614
Gracias

655
01:06:54,331 --> 01:06:54,791
Veto

656
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:03,885
This is to char it in Internet.

657
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:06,975
There they speak of everything
It does not pay much attention to him.

658
01:07:06,976 --> 01:07:09,727
We tracked a
a store of you donate.

659
01:07:09,728 --> 01:07:12,165
But this solciitud of
authorization delta…

660
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:15,274
… salio of the office
of FBI of Filadelfia.

661
01:07:15,275 --> 01:07:20,245
Google says that the store of
you donate and the office estan closely together.

662
01:07:20,246 --> 01:07:23,953
Single a person awkward person with
Swagger before she disappeared.

663
01:07:23,954 --> 01:07:27,474
She lives in “Fili”
And she works for FBI

664
01:07:27,927 --> 01:07:29,487
Nicholas Menphis.

665
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,030
For a man
that nonwise much…

666
01:07:34,031 --> 01:07:37,291
you took much
time to say it.

667
01:07:37,918 --> 01:07:38,998
Denle water.

668
01:07:59,424 --> 01:08:01,504
You do not have to tinkle?

669
01:08:01,547 --> 01:08:03,333
We have sacarte the drugs

670
01:08:03,334 --> 01:08:05,757
Veria very suspicious
if you committed suicide.

671
01:08:05,758 --> 01:08:08,352
… full of drugs that
they use in the agency.

672
01:08:08,353 --> 01:08:10,493
I am not going away to force suicide on!

673
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:12,070
Clear that if.

674
01:08:12,807 --> 01:08:14,827
Saquenlo and preparenlo.

675
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,057
That is my pistol!

676
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:26,306
If, and you wrote a note
it forces suicide on very stirring.

677
01:08:26,307 --> 01:08:30,087
Very guilty you sentias
by your errors.

678
01:08:36,043 --> 01:08:38,363
You can let resist.

679
01:08:41,093 --> 01:08:46,313
This thing works. It is not
the first time that we used it.

680
01:08:49,676 --> 01:08:51,076
Russo! Russo!

681
01:08:51,376 --> 01:08:52,836
The Davises see here!

682
01:08:57,894 --> 01:09:00,534
Because they estan taking as much?

683
01:09:37,362 --> 01:09:40,820
Does not kill to me, please!
Does not kill to me! I create to him!

684
01:09:40,821 --> 01:09:45,321
Matarte? If he wanted matarte
estarias already died.

685
01:09:45,562 --> 01:09:49,262
That class of cabron
invention this thing?

686
01:09:56,558 --> 01:10:01,398
Not this badly with 22
and an unexpected silencer.

687
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,421
Ayudame to throw water to them.

688
01:10:03,422 --> 01:10:05,502
You used to Me of bait!

689
01:10:05,953 --> 01:10:08,763
Your you create?
The serve of its hiding place, no?

690
01:10:08,764 --> 01:10:12,008
It hoped to take hold to one,
but they were going to you to kill.

691
01:10:12,009 --> 01:10:17,228
It contracts a good lawyer and it will call
to FBI. They can make a good treatment.

692
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:20,145
You can demonstrate
that your you did not kill it.

693
01:10:20,146 --> 01:10:24,466
You do not understand. These boys
they killed my dog.

694
01:10:25,852 --> 01:10:28,862
It is century 21. You cannot
to fight against this people.

695
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,464
In the end, the law…

696
01:10:30,465 --> 01:10:33,070
The law never goes them to take hold.

697
01:10:33,071 --> 01:10:34,959
Soon you would volveran to its business.

698
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,388
New names, the same history.
And I estare died.

699
01:10:38,389 --> 01:10:40,728
It is going to be a hard, filthy work.

700
01:10:40,729 --> 01:10:43,084
It is going to have but shots
and but died.

701
01:10:43,085 --> 01:10:46,361
I not it empece
but I am going it to finish.

702
01:10:46,362 --> 01:10:49,522
So it decides.
Participas or no?

703
01:10:51,849 --> 01:10:56,893
I did not go to a meeting where me
you were going to dismiss by bad conduct…

704
01:10:56,894 --> 01:11:00,914
… because I kidnap myself
people who do not exist.

705
01:11:04,522 --> 01:11:06,315
I take hold the legs.

706
01:11:06,316 --> 01:11:08,084
Good decision, pig.

707
01:11:08,085 --> 01:11:10,955
An inexperienced agent of
FBI I kill them to the three?

708
01:11:10,956 --> 01:11:13,836
Solto and I kill them to the 3?

709
01:11:14,697 --> 01:11:18,597
No, they killed it of a distance of 200 M.s

710
01:11:20,587 --> 01:11:22,807
With rifle caliber 22

711
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:26,072
- Swagger this alive one
- If

712
01:11:26,145 --> 01:11:29,525
And that boy
the agent of FBI…

713
01:11:31,879 --> 01:11:36,990
… Nick Memphis, who consiguio
a level authorization delta…

714
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:41,271
… it has not returned to his office
and this with.

715
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:46,748
Volvi to review the finances of Swagger

716
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:50,550
Once a year it commanded to him
flowers to somebody with its visa.

717
01:11:50,551 --> 01:11:53,342
Consegui dirrecion
through floreria.

718
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,571
The widow of Donni
the day of its death.

719
01:11:56,572 --> 01:12:01,040
This using its name as a single person.
For that reason habiamos not detected it.

720
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:05,078
Perhaps she ea the only one
that it creates to him to Swagger.

721
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:07,639
Watch. Keene City, Kentucky.

722
01:12:08,355 --> 01:12:10,515
One can be handling.

723
01:12:11,029 --> 01:12:13,649
That delays? It takes the airplane.

724
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:26,614
We gave to Swagger a new one him
war, I find a new surveyor.

725
01:12:26,615 --> 01:12:28,755
This goes away to put worse.

726
01:12:29,518 --> 01:12:31,078
Athens, Tennessee

727
01:12:57,488 --> 01:12:59,488
I believe that already we arrived.

728
01:13:00,187 --> 01:13:01,427
It hears, Swagger.

729
01:13:05,657 --> 01:13:07,657
I believe that already we arrived.

730
01:13:10,155 --> 01:13:12,255
Welcome to Tennessee.

731
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,335
State patrono to kill things.

732
01:13:16,832 --> 01:13:18,595
That is east type?

733
01:13:18,596 --> 01:13:22,603
The best escopetero of the east
of the Mississippi. It is a legend.

734
01:13:22,604 --> 01:13:25,728
It knows but of arms that
the people of Smith & Wesson.

735
01:13:25,729 --> 01:13:29,292
She knows that we come from
she makes 5 km Takes care of your modales.

736
01:13:29,293 --> 01:13:33,368
They came from very far.
That is what they look for?

737
01:13:33,369 --> 01:13:34,229
Wisdom

738
01:13:36,288 --> 01:13:38,007
They were mistaken of place.

739
01:13:38,008 --> 01:13:38,628
Perhaps.

740
01:13:39,519 --> 01:13:43,178
If you want to shoot with rifle
and that the bullet is equal to the one of another one…

741
01:13:43,179 --> 01:13:44,423
Can be done?

742
01:13:44,424 --> 01:13:47,144
Sientese. Tome seat, gentleman.

743
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:55,697
If you can obtain a bullet
that salio intact of first rifle…

744
01:13:55,698 --> 01:13:57,563
They can equal the grooves.

745
01:13:57,564 --> 01:13:59,865
For a long time nobody has been doing that.

746
01:13:59,866 --> 01:14:03,355
The bullet that removed from
archbishop was destroyed.

747
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,456
They collated it metalquirurgicamente.

748
01:14:05,457 --> 01:14:06,857
Thanks, mother.

749
01:14:07,004 --> 01:14:09,792
They do not sabian it safe,
they must make sure.

750
01:14:09,793 --> 01:14:11,973
As they can make sure?

751
01:14:14,499 --> 01:14:15,579
Good coffee?

752
01:14:15,987 --> 01:14:16,367
If.

753
01:14:18,447 --> 01:14:22,434
Watch his left.
Second shelf downwards.

754
01:14:22,435 --> 01:14:24,275
Red leather back.

755
01:14:24,664 --> 01:14:27,284
Writing by a certain Schofeld.

756
01:14:28,819 --> 01:14:34,259
There I put it 15 years ago.
One has not moved since then.

757
01:14:48,225 --> 01:14:50,865
Aligning bullets for effects.

758
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:54,519
If, envelope of paper.

759
01:14:54,585 --> 01:14:57,285
But the modern thing. 1870, Africa.

760
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:01,740
Bullet surrounded in paper.
Metal does not touch metal in the tube.

761
01:15:01,741 --> 01:15:05,089
The groove serian equal.
The paper falls when leaving.

762
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:07,086
I do not leave to sign when doing impact.

763
01:15:07,087 --> 01:15:11,035
It is an interesting question.
Hopefully they esten satisfied.

764
01:15:11,036 --> 01:15:12,116
I have another one.

765
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:14,400
Me it imagined it.

766
01:15:14,495 --> 01:15:17,479
If estuivera looking for
man for a shot to 2000 M.s

767
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,382
That podria to guess right?

768
01:15:19,383 --> 01:15:23,243
Somebody acerto a
that distance recently.

769
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:27,014
They say that the type
Bob Lee Swagger calls.

770
01:15:27,015 --> 01:15:29,518
I not it conzco,
so not.

771
01:15:29,519 --> 01:15:31,059
If, that said.

772
01:15:31,256 --> 01:15:35,533
Also they said that the endulzadores
artificales were safe…

773
01:15:35,534 --> 01:15:37,972
… and that habia chemical arms in Iraq.

774
01:15:37,973 --> 01:15:41,573
… and that Anna Nicle case by love.

775
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:45,066
But it was not a good work.

776
01:15:45,067 --> 01:15:45,987
So that?

777
01:15:46,325 --> 01:15:48,698
The one that firing already
it must be dead.

778
01:15:48,699 --> 01:15:50,556
Thus they are the compltos.

779
01:15:50,557 --> 01:15:54,632
The boys of the hill
green they died to the 3 hours.

780
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:58,228
Buried in the desert,
Anonymous tombs in Terlingua.

781
01:15:58,229 --> 01:15:59,995
Knows It with certainty?

782
01:15:59,996 --> 01:16:02,376
Still I do not have the shovel.

783
01:16:03,822 --> 01:16:06,123
Habra somebody outside?

784
01:16:06,124 --> 01:16:07,762
Habia a type in Russia.

785
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:09,083
They locked up it.

786
01:16:09,959 --> 01:16:13,530
Habia another one in France.
That this dead.

787
01:16:13,531 --> 01:16:15,071
Habia a type…

788
01:16:15,652 --> 01:16:18,032
that I hope no longer shoots.

789
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:20,390
A brutal son of puta.

790
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:24,753
The majority throws to kill,
it threw to hurt.

791
01:16:24,754 --> 01:16:28,223
It hoped that they arrived
the friends to help and Iso killed.

792
01:16:28,224 --> 01:16:30,990
Convertia a target in four.

793
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:34,711
Men, women, children.
I kill hundreds.

794
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:37,472
The other side queria
to assassinate it, and like.

795
01:16:37,473 --> 01:16:42,333
They found it in a building
left of 6 floors.

796
01:16:43,741 --> 01:16:45,948
They were left of subtilities.

797
01:16:45,949 --> 01:16:48,606
They requested an attack
of artillery.

798
01:16:48,607 --> 01:16:50,607
They devastated with an apple.

799
01:16:50,608 --> 01:16:52,932
They threw to him I build above.

800
01:16:52,933 --> 01:16:55,438
They say that salio
crawling of there.

801
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:57,400
Others say that murio.

802
01:16:57,401 --> 01:16:59,681
Volvi to never hear of

803
01:17:00,381 --> 01:17:01,081
Carajo.

804
01:17:01,972 --> 01:17:02,512
That?

805
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:05,679
I conoci to the son of puta.

806
01:17:08,976 --> 01:17:12,419
The world is not
that it seems. Truth sergeant?

807
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:13,420
No, Sir.

808
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:15,574
Have that present.

809
01:17:15,575 --> 01:17:20,215
At the moment that creates
that entendio, this mistaken.

810
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:23,950
Tiene names?

811
01:17:29,047 --> 01:17:30,887
Hello, I, Nick are.

812
01:17:30,894 --> 01:17:33,654
Sabes in that mess you put?

813
01:17:34,618 --> 01:17:36,415
These good? Where these?

814
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:38,096
Better I do not say to you.

815
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,479
Tienes a pen?

816
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,635
I need that you look for somebody.
Mikayla Sczerbiak

817
01:17:43,636 --> 01:17:45,802
- You have It?
- If. Already.

818
01:17:45,803 --> 01:17:47,663
He is dificl to spell.

819
01:17:53,685 --> 01:17:56,748
Swagger goes to do what knows to do.

820
01:17:56,749 --> 01:17:59,304
It tried to track the gunner.

821
01:17:59,305 --> 01:18:00,925
It did not arrive far.

822
01:18:01,228 --> 01:18:02,688
If, if it arrived.

823
01:18:02,743 --> 01:18:04,761
Like?
- We go It to help.

824
01:18:04,762 --> 01:18:10,202
In order to catch the wolf it has
that to tie the bait to a tree.

825
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:17,450
That happens to him to the bait?

826
01:18:18,221 --> 01:18:19,841
It is difficult to know.

827
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:24,430
But it is is
problem of the bait.

828
01:18:36,404 --> 01:18:38,181
Nick speaks. You found It?

829
01:18:38,182 --> 01:18:39,722
This in virgina.

830
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:43,984
An end that creiamos
that solto was tied.

831
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:45,969
That means that colonel?

832
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:47,750
Swagger follows alive.

833
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:52,100
God mine.

834
01:18:53,323 --> 01:18:59,043
I need that a transport lands
without customs review it.

835
01:18:59,423 --> 01:19:04,803
Surely it does not agree to know to me,
but, That there is in the airplane?

836
01:19:04,886 --> 01:19:06,867
The equipment of Ethiopia.

837
01:19:06,868 --> 01:19:09,188
24 good, hard men.

838
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:11,349
Arms and equipment.

839
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:13,085
Single 24?

840
01:19:15,055 --> 01:19:16,995
Asegurese to kill it.

841
01:19:18,194 --> 01:19:21,070
It does not leave to loose ends this time.

842
01:19:21,071 --> 01:19:23,091
Good night colonel.

843
01:19:24,113 --> 01:19:26,213
Good night, senator.

844
01:19:43,303 --> 01:19:43,923
hello?

845
01:19:47,216 --> 01:19:48,836
Hay somebody there?

846
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:26,105
Now he watches.

847
01:20:26,728 --> 01:20:28,648
Sight which you did.

848
01:20:31,919 --> 01:20:32,839
Dame that.

849
01:20:33,344 --> 01:20:36,884
I do not want that you hurt yourself
This good?

850
01:20:44,744 --> 01:20:46,744
Where this your fiancè?

851
01:20:49,156 --> 01:20:51,037
That if it is a trap?

852
01:20:51,038 --> 01:20:52,445
If it is a trap.

853
01:20:52,446 --> 01:20:54,326
Guaranteed. Always.

854
01:20:56,607 --> 01:20:58,307
But, for that?

855
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:01,687
You have your list, no?

856
01:21:01,688 --> 01:21:03,068
Atente a ella.

857
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:32,488
Vamonos.

858
01:21:37,985 --> 01:21:40,475
¿Para que son estas, de nuevo?

859
01:21:40,476 --> 01:21:42,745
El gas lacrimogeno
estara en mi remoto.

860
01:21:42,746 --> 01:21:43,046
Si

861
01:21:44,198 --> 01:21:48,394
Napalm en el primer piso,
bombas de tubo para los demas.

862
01:21:48,395 --> 01:21:52,460
Ten mucho cuidado con estas.
Tienen un radio de 5 metros.

863
01:21:52,461 --> 01:21:54,886
¿Para que nos
estamos preparando?

864
01:21:54,887 --> 01:21:57,267
Para todo lo que podamos.

865
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:13,299
Hay 4 combatientes enemigos
Matalos uno por uno.

866
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:17,100
Sigue disparando,
que nadie te distraiga.

867
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:25,344
¡Carajo!

868
01:22:27,341 --> 01:22:29,281
Nada debe dsitraerte.

869
01:22:29,799 --> 01:22:33,559
Lento es suave,
suave es rapido. A ver.

870
01:22:50,813 --> 01:22:53,413
Solo estamos tu y yo, nena.

871
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,630
Hay tres guardias.

872
01:22:59,176 --> 01:23:01,296
Uno a las 2 en punto.

873
01:23:02,196 --> 01:23:03,716
...o a las 12.

874
01:23:04,654 --> 01:23:06,094
...y a las 10.

875
01:23:14,132 --> 01:23:17,752
Peligro cerca.
2 del reloj, 50 metros.

876
01:24:20,148 --> 01:24:23,088
Tienes uno encima
y acercandose.

877
01:25:13,193 --> 01:25:16,324
Revisa el perímetro. Y diles
a los demás que estén alerta

878
01:25:16,684 --> 01:25:18,469
Enseguida, Señor

879
01:26:13,075 --> 01:26:14,786
¿Mataste a los tres?

880
01:26:15,645 --> 01:26:16,282
Había cuatro

881
01:26:17,193 --> 01:26:20,688
Quiero el nombre real de
Johnson, para quien trabaja...

882
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:23,618
...y por que se esforzó tanto
para matar al arzobispo.

883
01:26:25,012 --> 01:26:28,867
¿No lo mataste tu?

884
01:26:29,103 --> 01:26:31,702
Entonces no vales nada
Te mato y me voy.

885
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,047
Johnson ha tenido
muchos nombres

886
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:41,461
No se si uno es mas
real que los demás

887
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:44,743
Saber seria peligroso.

888
01:26:46,032 --> 01:26:47,544
Es ex oficial del ejercito.

889
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:50,041
Estoy seguro que era un coronel.

890
01:26:53,645 --> 01:26:54,670
Continua.

891
01:26:56,391 --> 01:26:59,533
No murieron por mi
lo hicieron por ti

892
01:27:00,275 --> 01:27:02,680
Reclutando para un solo trabajo

893
01:27:04,297 --> 01:27:06,045
Les gustan los heridos.

894
01:27:06,871 --> 01:27:08,663
Son mas fáciles de usar...

895
01:27:09,517 --> 01:27:11,984
...y los puedes tirar
cuando acabas.

896
01:27:12,908 --> 01:27:14,989
Timmy, tu, yo.

897
01:27:17,477 --> 01:27:22,488
Ya que has sido el lobo
es difícil ser el chivo amarrado.

898
01:27:23,565 --> 01:27:28,415
Somos un muerto
hablando con otro.

899
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:30,963
¿Y el arzobispo?

900
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:36,299
¿Quieres eliminar sospechas
cuando mates a alguien?

901
01:27:36,568 --> 01:27:39,288
Espera a que este
al lado del presidente.

902
01:27:40,365 --> 01:27:41,916
¿Que iba a decir?

903
01:27:42,701 --> 01:27:43,765
La verdad.

904
01:27:44,281 --> 01:27:47,316
Que nada.
Por mas horrible que sea...

905
01:27:47,814 --> 01:27:51,117
...sucede sin la
aprobación del gobierno.

906
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:53,434
Allá. Y aquí.

907
01:27:55,717 --> 01:27:57,703
El problema no es hacerlo.

908
01:27:58,795 --> 01:28:02,764
Es que los gobernantes tengan
que admitir que lo sabían.

909
01:28:04,418 --> 01:28:09,787
Torturan a prisioneros de Abú Ghrait
y solo encarcelan a subordinados.

910
01:28:10,136 --> 01:28:11,625
Sus jefes sabían

911
01:28:11,864 --> 01:28:14,033
Sabemos que sus jefes sabían.

912
01:28:14,229 --> 01:28:15,396
Pero no lo dices.

913
01:28:15,589 --> 01:28:17,325
¿Que paso
exactamente en África?

914
01:28:17,524 --> 01:28:22,317
La gente de un pueblo
no pensó que un oleoducto...

915
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:25,332
...fuera razón suficiente
para cambiar su pueblo...

916
01:28:25,545 --> 01:28:28,639
...a un lugar donde los
dioses espíritus no existían.

917
01:28:29,035 --> 01:28:30,050
¿Una copa?

918
01:28:30,236 --> 01:28:33,336
Les pidieron que se fueran.
¿se negaron y los mataron?

919
01:28:33,796 --> 01:28:37,892
No se lo pidieron,
solo los mataron. A todos.

920
01:28:38,127 --> 01:28:41,355
Para no tener que pedírselo
al siguiente pueblo.

921
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:43,112
Para que se fueran.

922
01:28:54,377 --> 01:28:57,711
Hay una fosa común
con 400 cadáveres...

923
01:28:58,619 --> 01:29:02,190
...hombres, mujeres, niños...

924
01:29:02,402 --> 01:29:07,579
Bajo la vieja estación de bombeo
10 Km. dentro de Eritrea.

925
01:29:08,755 --> 01:29:10,077
Tu deberías saberlo.

926
01:29:10,365 --> 01:29:14,963
Cubriste la retirada de los
contratistas que hicieron el trabajo.

927
01:29:15,847 --> 01:29:19,035
Tampoco deberías haber
sobrevivido esa vez.

928
01:29:28,017 --> 01:29:29,093
¿Quien controla a Johnson?

929
01:29:29,301 --> 01:29:31,640
Un senador
De Montana, creo.

930
01:29:32,987 --> 01:29:34,657
No entiendes.

931
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:37,634
No hay una cabeza
que cortar.

932
01:29:38,354 --> 01:29:40,418
Es un conglomerado.

933
01:29:40,706 --> 01:29:44,035
Si uno de ellos traiciona los
principios...

934
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:52,905
De lo que se trata...

935
01:29:55,053 --> 01:29:57,514
...es de la debilidad humana.

936
01:29:58,778 --> 01:30:01,941
No puedes matar
eso con un arma.

937
01:30:10,025 --> 01:30:11,239
Swagger. Swagger

938
01:30:11,804 --> 01:30:14,119
Tienes que irte
Están en todos lados-

939
01:30:15,196 --> 01:30:17,711
Tenia que detenerte
hasta que llegaran

940
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:22,821
Mintiendo no te iba a detener.

941
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:25,649
Te hubieras dado cuenta.

942
01:30:30,204 --> 01:30:33,471
A propósito, tienen a tu mujer.

943
01:30:38,824 --> 01:30:41,459
Están a 20 metros y acercándose
tienes que largarte.

944
01:30:43,117 --> 01:30:45,058
-Vete al escondite 2.
-Entendido

945
01:31:16,839 --> 01:31:21,738
Estoy en posición 2. Tienes que irte
de ahí. Están en todos lados

946
01:31:22,032 --> 01:31:23,638
Cálmate

947
01:31:23,942 --> 01:31:26,717
Vuela las bombas de
tubo cuando te diga ¿si?

948
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:28,690
Si, entiendo.

949
01:31:36,301 --> 01:31:39,628
Cuando diga "uno", vuelas
las bombas de tubo, luego el gas

950
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:43,058
Tres, dos, uno.

951
01:32:13,206 --> 01:32:14,345
!Vuela el napalm!

952
01:33:09,371 --> 01:33:10,073
!Swagger!

953
01:33:17,557 --> 01:33:18,539
Tu puedes.

954
01:33:35,751 --> 01:33:36,817
!Swagger!

955
01:33:43,715 --> 01:33:46,216
Cuando diga,
escóndete tras el granero

956
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:48,337
¿Listo? !Corre!

957
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:26,463
Hay que llegar a esos árboles
Te quedan 5 tiros. Saca al pájaro

958
01:34:26,736 --> 01:34:27,677
Esta bien.

959
01:34:27,885 --> 01:34:29,230
Yo te cubro.

960
01:34:31,836 --> 01:34:33,085
!Corre!

961
01:34:46,375 --> 01:34:48,213
!Elévate! !Elévate!

962
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:05,210
!Hora de irnos!

963
01:35:25,392 --> 01:35:26,714
Buenos días, preciosa.

964
01:35:26,974 --> 01:35:28,943
¿Viste este tiroteo
raro en virginia?

965
01:35:29,161 --> 01:35:33,509
Bolas, restos de un helicopeero,
sangre, Ningún cadáver.

966
01:35:33,744 --> 01:35:37,024
Hallaron huellas
en los cartuchos

967
01:35:37,235 --> 01:35:40,594
El primer juego pertenece
a Bob Lee Swagger.

968
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:47,448
El segundo juego es del agente
especial Nick Memphis

969
01:35:47,766 --> 01:35:49,427
No puede ser.

970
01:35:52,699 --> 01:35:56,098
La única pregunta
razonable que queda es:

971
01:35:58,533 --> 01:36:00,902
¿Que carajos esta pasando?

972
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:07,306
!Excelente tiro!

973
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:16,173
Estoy pensando que Ud.
No era el hombre indicado.

974
01:36:18,011 --> 01:36:19,437
Piense lo que quiera.

975
01:36:22,017 --> 01:36:25,941
Parece que juzgamos
mal al sargento

976
01:36:27,966 --> 01:36:32,956
Siempre hay un alma confusa que
cree que puede cambiar el mundo

977
01:36:33,815 --> 01:36:36,971
Y tienes que matarlo
para convencerlo de que no.

978
01:36:39,247 --> 01:36:41,296
Ese es el primer problema
de la democracia

979
01:36:45,373 --> 01:36:48,456
BOZEMAN, MONTANA

980
01:37:00,939 --> 01:37:03,091
Anna, llévate un
equipo a la posada.

981
01:37:03,346 --> 01:37:05,768
No me importa quien sea.

982
01:37:06,452 --> 01:37:09,137
!Oigan! tenemos a
Memphis en la línea

983
01:37:09,447 --> 01:37:10,547
Empieza el rastreo.

984
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:12,444
Ya esta.

985
01:37:12,846 --> 01:37:15,352
Nick. Hola, habla Howard,
¿como estas?

986
01:37:15,604 --> 01:37:18,610
Las cosas se complicaron.
Tengo a Swagger bajo custodia.

987
01:37:19,473 --> 01:37:21,534
Resulta que no esta muerto.

988
01:37:21,737 --> 01:37:24,686
Nos han llegado noticias
de esa posibilidad.

989
01:37:25,036 --> 01:37:25,818
Ya lo ubique

990
01:37:26,031 --> 01:37:28,138
¿Estuviste en el tiroteo
en Virginia anoche?

991
01:37:28,337 --> 01:37:31,049
Como dije, las cosas
se han complicado

992
01:37:31,265 --> 01:37:35,231
Obviamente lo mejor será
que nos lo trajeras, ¿no?

993
01:37:35,434 --> 01:37:37,242
No puedo hacer eso.

994
01:37:37,514 --> 01:37:38,325
¿Por que?

995
01:37:38,496 --> 01:37:40,624
No esta claro en
quien se puede confiar.

996
01:37:41,327 --> 01:37:42,887
Somos el FBI, hijo.

997
01:37:43,364 --> 01:37:44,292
Si, ya lo se.

998
01:37:44,515 --> 01:37:45,731
Me mantendré en contacto.

999
01:37:45,965 --> 01:37:46,977
Nick, !espera!

1000
01:37:47,293 --> 01:37:48,573
!Hijo de puta!

1001
01:37:48,878 --> 01:37:50,061
-¿Lo ubicaste?
-Si

1002
01:37:50,268 --> 01:37:52,588
Una carretera en las
afueras de Bozeman

1003
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:53,773
!Apúrense!

1004
01:37:58,826 --> 01:38:01,146
-Swagger
-Habla el coronel Johnson.

1005
01:38:01,341 --> 01:38:03,847
-Pensé que iba a escuchar.
-No tienes a donde ir.

1006
01:38:04,233 --> 01:38:05,946
Coronel... si es coronel.

1007
01:38:06,499 --> 01:38:07,433
Lo soy.

1008
01:38:08,975 --> 01:38:10,959
Yo tengo algo que quieres.

1009
01:38:11,197 --> 01:38:12,579
Yo también.

1010
01:38:15,674 --> 01:38:19,961
Pasando la frontera de Eritrea hay
una fosa común con 400 cadáveres

1011
01:38:20,164 --> 01:38:22,700
Hombres, mujeres, niños...

1012
01:38:23,733 --> 01:38:27,478
Se lo doy y estamos a mano.
Solo quiero a alguien confiable.

1013
01:38:27,711 --> 01:38:29,681
Suena bien. ¿A quien quieres?

1014
01:38:29,932 --> 01:38:32,099
¿Que tal al tipo
de U2 con los lentes?

1015
01:38:32,368 --> 01:38:34,631
Amigo de Nelson Mandela
suena de confianza.

1016
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:36,838
¿Bono?
¿Quieres que te manden a Bono?

1017
01:38:37,145 --> 01:38:39,300
Mi colega cuestiona mi decisión.

1018
01:38:40,204 --> 01:38:43,563
Entienda el problema, como
es cosa de ultimo momento.

1019
01:38:44,463 --> 01:38:47,729
¿El seis veces senador
de Montana, Charles Meachum?

1020
01:38:48,081 --> 01:38:50,780
Parece una ultima
segunda opción ¿no?

1021
01:38:52,644 --> 01:38:53,783
No me parece.

1022
01:38:53,989 --> 01:38:56,506
Le daré dos números
Luego hablamos.

1023
01:38:56,881 --> 01:38:58,231
.732.

1024
01:38:58,452 --> 01:38:59,790
.648.

1025
01:39:00,108 --> 01:39:01,316
¿Que demonios es eso?

1026
01:39:01,588 --> 01:39:04,595
Los tres dígitos de
latitud y longitud...

1027
01:39:04,785 --> 01:39:08,617
...de una estación de bombeo
de petróleo con 400 cadáveres.

1028
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:10,518
¿Donde nos vemos?

1029
01:39:11,598 --> 01:39:13,781
En un lugar donde te
pueda ver.

1030
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:17,881
...acércate desde muy lejos.

1031
01:39:54,773 --> 01:39:55,796
Vamos

1032
01:40:26,351 --> 01:40:27,474
¿Donde esta tu muchacho?

1033
01:40:41,862 --> 01:40:43,432
Bueno, aquí estoy.

1034
01:40:52,308 --> 01:40:53,557
El esta aquí.

1035
01:40:53,868 --> 01:40:55,289
Mira.

1036
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:57,744
Ahí esta tu muchacho, nena.

1037
01:41:07,077 --> 01:41:08,391
Vamos, mira.

1038
01:41:18,675 --> 01:41:19,747
Bueno.

1039
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:05,191
!Me rompió una costilla!

1040
01:42:06,519 --> 01:42:07,748
!No se mueva!

1041
01:42:08,542 --> 01:42:10,073
¿Hay otro tirador?

1042
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:11,501
No

1043
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:41,034
!Si me tira a la cabeza,
mi espasmo la mata!

1044
01:42:42,245 --> 01:42:43,830
!No me puedes disparar!

1045
01:42:44,694 --> 01:42:47,593
No me puedes disparar,
Swagger ¿me oyes?

1046
01:42:50,447 --> 01:42:52,491
!No puedes!

1047
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:06,762
! se acabo amigo!

1048
01:43:11,075 --> 01:43:14,059
Que se valla al carajo
No puede hacer nada.

1049
01:43:28,104 --> 01:43:29,605
!No estuvo mal!

1050
01:43:30,335 --> 01:43:31,967
!Bastante bien! !Dio el tiro!

1051
01:43:34,222 --> 01:43:35,210
Cielos.

1052
01:43:53,152 --> 01:43:54,302
¿En que le puedo servir?

1053
01:43:54,537 --> 01:43:58,652
Un huésped del motel me dijo $100
para traer esto a las 3:00

1054
01:43:59,269 --> 01:44:00,552
DE NICK MEMPHIS

1055
01:44:02,172 --> 01:44:03,366
!Muévanse!

1056
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:33,415
¿Estas bien?

1057
01:44:45,566 --> 01:44:46,579
Regístralo

1058
01:44:46,816 --> 01:44:48,350
Yo no porto armas.

1059
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:52,184
Normalmente

1060
01:44:52,637 --> 01:44:54,802
Tengo una para
practicar

1061
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:03,995
Sácala

1062
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:08,229
!suelte su arma!
!Suéltela!

1063
01:45:08,463 --> 01:45:09,812
!Suelte su arma!

1064
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:11,145
!Tranquilo!

1065
01:45:20,649 --> 01:45:21,723
Sarah

1066
01:45:22,897 --> 01:45:24,111
Dame la pistola

1067
01:45:25,176 --> 01:45:27,079
Todo esta bien
Dame la pistola

1068
01:45:36,271 --> 01:45:37,547
¿Estas bien?

1069
01:45:37,912 --> 01:45:40,362
Manos arriba. No las bajes

1070
01:45:40,594 --> 01:45:42,136
Tiras bien, sargento.

1071
01:45:43,192 --> 01:45:47,820
Ya tienes lo que querías
Nos debes tu parte del trato

1072
01:45:48,117 --> 01:45:49,132
¿Ud. cree?

1073
01:45:49,389 --> 01:45:51,894
Si, hijo ya lo creo.

1074
01:45:52,744 --> 01:45:57,539
¿Por que no consideramos todo
lo que paso como un preámbulo?

1075
01:45:57,834 --> 01:46:02,055
¿Que planes tienes ahora? tienes
unas habilidades muy especiales

1076
01:46:02,262 --> 01:46:04,660
Me interesaría
ofrecerte un trabajo

1077
01:46:04,922 --> 01:46:06,143
¿Un trabajo?

1078
01:46:06,376 --> 01:46:07,491
¿Para usted?

1079
01:46:07,742 --> 01:46:10,581
No es tan malo como parece
igual se va a hacer

1080
01:46:10,814 --> 01:46:14,534
Mejor estar del lado que te
paga bien por tu esfuerzo

1081
01:46:14,789 --> 01:46:16,687
¿Y de que lado esta usted?

1082
01:46:16,911 --> 01:46:21,114
No hay lados. No hay gunnis ni chiítas.
demócratas ni republicanos

1083
01:46:21,277 --> 01:46:23,399
Solo hay ricos y pobres

1084
01:46:23,752 --> 01:46:26,175
¿Que implica trabajar
para Ud. Senador?

1085
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,768
¿Matar a mujeres y
niños inocentes?

1086
01:46:30,041 --> 01:46:33,196
Aprobó el asesinato de todo
un pueblo por oleoducto

1087
01:46:33,409 --> 01:46:34,442
!Un pueblo!

1088
01:46:34,785 --> 01:46:37,014
Y la religión se estabilizo

1089
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:39,702
O sea que nadie les
va a cortar los brazos..

1090
01:46:39,914 --> 01:46:43,414
...porque su tatarabuela
pertenecía a otra tribu.

1091
01:46:44,966 --> 01:46:46,879
Les caemos bien, muchacho.

1092
01:46:53,723 --> 01:46:57,363
Este es un país en que el
Ministro de Defensa

1093
01:47:00,644 --> 01:47:05,059
...puede salir en la tele y
decirle al publico americano...

1094
01:47:05,284 --> 01:47:08,498
"Peleamos por la libertad
no por el petróleo".

1095
01:47:09,276 --> 01:47:11,006
!Y nadie lo cuestiona!

1096
01:47:11,433 --> 01:47:14,115
No quieres oír la respuesta
por que es mentira

1097
01:47:16,985 --> 01:47:20,010
Solo hay cierto numero
de lugares en la mesa.

1098
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:24,618
¿Estas dentro o estas fuera?

1099
01:47:31,644 --> 01:47:32,929
!Es el FBI!

1100
01:47:34,155 --> 01:47:35,715
No pasara nada. Detén esto

1101
01:47:38,171 --> 01:47:41,718
Si uno de ellos traiciona
los principios de la adquisición

1102
01:47:41,984 --> 01:47:43,853
Creo que no, senador

1103
01:47:47,856 --> 01:47:48,518
Que haces

1104
01:47:48,812 --> 01:47:49,769
Salvándonos la vida

1105
01:47:49,859 --> 01:47:51,202
-!Eso te salvaba!
-!Nadie aquí es inocente!

1106
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:55,271
Esto es plutonio
!Nadie lo puede tocar sin morir!

1107
01:47:55,899 --> 01:47:59,195
Dáselo a las autoridades
y desaparece, con nosotros

1108
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,526
A menos que quieras yacer
afuera de Terlingua.

1109
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:06,754
!Yo me salgo! Soy un pueblerino
que vive en el monte con rifles

1110
01:48:07,226 --> 01:48:08,576
¿Contento?

1111
01:48:13,208 --> 01:48:15,028
¿A donde cree que va?

1112
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:16,708
A mi casa

1113
01:48:17,002 --> 01:48:19,640
¿Estas apuntando a un senador
de EE.UU. por las espalda?

1114
01:48:21,206 --> 01:48:22,837
Ganas no me faltan

1115
01:48:23,414 --> 01:48:24,954
Ya me lo imaginaba.

1116
01:48:26,759 --> 01:48:27,688
Que no se valla

1117
01:48:28,212 --> 01:48:29,751
Tienen tu rifle

1118
01:48:31,507 --> 01:48:33,984
Desde el principio
han tenido tu rifle

1119
01:48:34,215 --> 01:48:36,220
Lo recuperaron en el lugar

1120
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:45,252
Puedes hablar todo
lo que quieras.

1121
01:48:45,618 --> 01:48:48,680
...pero al final, morirás
por inyección letal

1122
01:48:49,044 --> 01:48:51,534
Y yo volveré a lo
que estaba haciendo.

1123
01:48:56,294 --> 01:48:57,567
Gane yo.

1124
01:48:58,432 --> 01:48:59,628
Tu perdiste

1125
01:49:00,992 --> 01:49:02,865
Acostúmbrate a la idea, hijo

1126
01:49:03,449 --> 01:49:05,021
No me diga hijo

1127
01:49:19,789 --> 01:49:21,507
!Suelten sus armas! !bájenlas!

1128
01:49:21,761 --> 01:49:22,974
Soy Nick Memphis

1129
01:49:23,391 --> 01:49:25,340
!No disparen!

1130
01:49:25,543 --> 01:49:26,962
!Abajo ahora!

1131
01:49:27,318 --> 01:49:27,807
!Al piso!

1132
01:49:27,992 --> 01:49:29,441
!Todos échense al piso!

1133
01:49:48,734 --> 01:49:50,743
¿Me pueden soltar
las manos, por favor?

1134
01:49:51,194 --> 01:49:52,448
Gracias, señor.

1135
01:49:54,278 --> 01:49:55,679
Gracias por traerla.

1136
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:04,249
Lamento todo lo que paso

1137
01:50:04,471 --> 01:50:06,167
No es tu culpa. Así es.

1138
01:50:10,532 --> 01:50:13,112
El Procurador General Russer

1139
01:50:13,928 --> 01:50:15,306
El Director Branat

1140
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:18,708
El Senador Meachum
no pudo venir hoy.

1141
01:50:18,985 --> 01:50:20,727
Podemos arreglarnos sin el

1142
01:50:21,228 --> 01:50:23,625
Sargento Swagger
Ud. pidió esta reunión

1143
01:50:24,433 --> 01:50:27,836
A pesar de que no querían
yo accedí como favor al FBI

1144
01:50:28,034 --> 01:50:30,958
¿Que diablos hago aquí?
No tienen pruebas contra mi

1145
01:50:31,152 --> 01:50:33,329
Estoy protegido
Llame al Estado Mayor

1146
01:50:35,161 --> 01:50:39,227
No es necesario ya recibir mas
de una docena de llamadas.

1147
01:50:39,404 --> 01:50:43,351
...de individuos de alto rango
diciéndome que lo suelte.

1148
01:50:43,542 --> 01:50:46,993
Pero lo bueno de nuestro
sistema es que yo puedo...

1149
01:50:47,182 --> 01:50:50,711
...y la ley requiere,
que los mande al carajo.

1150
01:50:51,029 --> 01:50:54,759
Vamos a ver evidencia
así que quédese ahí, calladito.

1151
01:50:58,344 --> 01:51:00,049
Sargento, tiene 5 minutos

1152
01:51:00,705 --> 01:51:02,097
Gracias

1153
01:51:03,944 --> 01:51:05,282
Esta es mi arma.

1154
01:51:05,835 --> 01:51:08,057
No hay duda, no lo niego.

1155
01:51:08,643 --> 01:51:11,259
La recuperaron en la escena
después del asesinato.

1156
01:51:12,203 --> 01:51:15,558
¿Ha estado en posesión
del FBI no la han tocado?

1157
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:17,387
No, absolutamente nadie.

1158
01:51:17,593 --> 01:51:18,543
¿Disparo el arma?

1159
01:51:18,723 --> 01:51:21,599
No tenia caso.
La bala estaba irreconocible.

1160
01:51:21,891 --> 01:51:24,515
Sin embargo,
metalúrgicamente es idéntica.

1161
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,909
Definitivamente son mis balas

1162
01:51:28,193 --> 01:51:29,676
Definitivamente es mi rifle

1163
01:51:30,002 --> 01:51:32,443
Agente Memphis ¿Ud. cree
que mate al arzobispo?

1164
01:51:32,717 --> 01:51:34,462
No. Yo creo que no.

1165
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:36,549
-¿Tiene pruebas de ese hecho?
-No.

1166
01:51:36,792 --> 01:51:38,050
-¿Confía en mi?
-Si.

1167
01:51:38,543 --> 01:51:40,205
-¿Confía realmente en mi?
-Si

1168
01:51:41,784 --> 01:51:43,892
-¿Con su vida?
-Si

1169
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:45,630
Bueno.

1170
01:51:46,772 --> 01:51:49,131
¿Que demonios hace?
!Baje esa arma!

1171
01:51:49,383 --> 01:51:51,851
Si calculo a 550
Necesita apuntar mas bajo

1172
01:51:52,081 --> 01:51:53,491
No importa estando tan cerca.

1173
01:51:53,737 --> 01:51:56,409
Lo único que importa
es si estoy loco o no.

1174
01:52:02,935 --> 01:52:04,511
Puedo hacer esto una y otra vez.

1175
01:52:05,539 --> 01:52:06,835
Con todas las armas de mi casa.

1176
01:52:06,903 --> 01:52:10,259
Cambie todos los percutores
antes de irme. siempre lo hago.

1177
01:52:10,761 --> 01:52:14,026
Se ve normal, solo midiendo
es detectable. Pero no dispara.

1178
01:52:14,541 --> 01:52:18,583
La bala que le sacaron al obispo
salio de mi rifle una semana antes.

1179
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:22,076
Yo jure defender a este país
contra todos sus enemigos

1180
01:52:22,414 --> 01:52:24,592
Pero no pensaba
acabar involucrado.

1181
01:52:25,009 --> 01:52:28,338
No te puedes esconder
de la verdad, hijo de puta

1182
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:31,449
Da igual

1183
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:33,943
¿A quien le importa?

1184
01:52:34,809 --> 01:52:36,508
Buena presentación

1185
01:52:36,709 --> 01:52:38,594
Pero yo no tengo nada que ver.

1186
01:52:39,487 --> 01:52:42,540
Caballeros, esta junta se acabo.

1187
01:52:42,878 --> 01:52:44,163
Se termino.

1188
01:52:44,437 --> 01:52:45,722
Ya nos veremos.

1189
01:52:45,962 --> 01:52:48,831
Tienes razón. Esto no
demuestra que es culpable

1190
01:52:49,129 --> 01:52:50,282
Si. En este país.

1191
01:52:50,515 --> 01:52:52,850
Señor necesita ver estas fotos.

1192
01:52:58,337 --> 01:53:03,029
Son imágenes secretas de
la gente de un pueblo en África...

1193
01:53:03,767 --> 01:53:06,883
Que fue exterminado por
el coronel y su gente.

1194
01:53:07,452 --> 01:53:07,876
Dios mío.

1195
01:53:08,081 --> 01:53:11,458
Mira a tu alrededor
Este no es el Cuerno de África.

1196
01:53:11,776 --> 01:53:13,168
Es prueba de oídas

1197
01:53:13,402 --> 01:53:17,080
Esta es la tierra de los hombres
libres, y yo me puedo ir.

1198
01:53:18,421 --> 01:53:23,292
Su brújula moral esta tan jodida
que se perderá yendo a su auto

1199
01:53:24,027 --> 01:53:26,404
A pesar de lo que yo pienso...

1200
01:53:27,219 --> 01:53:30,438
...esto sucedió en otro país,
fuera de nuestras leyes.

1201
01:53:30,646 --> 01:53:32,922
¿Eso es todo?
¿No puede hacer nada?

1202
01:53:33,127 --> 01:53:34,893
No es la Corte Mundial

1203
01:53:35,738 --> 01:53:37,506
No puedo detener al coronel...

1204
01:53:37,748 --> 01:53:40,877
...por crímenes que
cometió en otro continente.

1205
01:53:41,117 --> 01:53:42,673
Por favor reconsidere.

1206
01:53:42,841 --> 01:53:44,224
No hay nada que reconsiderar.

1207
01:53:48,142 --> 01:53:49,146
Gano yo.

1208
01:53:49,855 --> 01:53:52,669
tu pierdes. De nuevo.

1209
01:53:55,072 --> 01:53:56,572
Esto es ridículo.

1210
01:54:18,866 --> 01:54:22,505
Que conté que no me
gusta como termino esto.

1211
01:54:22,989 --> 01:54:24,988
Pero así es nuestro mundo.

1212
01:54:25,217 --> 01:54:27,622
La justicia no siempre triunfa.

1213
01:54:28,053 --> 01:54:31,394
No es el Oeste en que se
limpiaban las calles a balazos.

1214
01:54:32,838 --> 01:54:35,696
Aunque a veces eso
es lo que se necesita.

1215
01:54:40,164 --> 01:54:42,059
Bob Lee Swagger, se puede ir.

1216
01:54:46,928 --> 01:54:48,772
Quítele las esposas.

1217
01:54:52,067 --> 01:54:54,207
Ese fue un tiro excelente

1218
01:54:54,496 --> 01:54:55,795
!En la cara!

1219
01:54:57,112 --> 01:54:59,036
¿Conoces la expresión:

1220
01:54:59,346 --> 01:55:02,439
"No sabia si cagar
o volverse ciego"?

1221
01:55:05,554 --> 01:55:08,494
Deberías haber visto la cara
del Procurador General.

1222
01:55:10,399 --> 01:55:14,022
¿Dio su discurso de
"Lo bueno de nuestro sistema"?

1223
01:55:14,359 --> 01:55:17,387
"Esto se trata de oír la evidencia
y averiguar la verdad"

1224
01:55:17,915 --> 01:55:20,327
Y luego dijiste:

1225
01:55:20,608 --> 01:55:22,602
"Vete al carajo".

1226
01:55:23,444 --> 01:55:25,922
"Deténgame mi habano
Don Procurador General".

1227
01:55:27,528 --> 01:55:28,863
!Vete al carajo!

1228
01:55:30,784 --> 01:55:33,472
La verdad es que yo
lo hago quien es.

1229
01:55:40,311 --> 01:55:44,022
Vas a salir del país mañana
vas a ir a Ecuador.

1230
01:55:48,539 --> 01:55:51,546
Estamos teniendo problemas
con la población local.

1231
01:55:51,826 --> 01:55:56,779
Tenemos al presente
pero te solicitaron a ti

1232
01:55:58,882 --> 01:56:00,374
Tiene solución.

1233
01:56:02,852 --> 01:56:04,307
Te solicitaron a ti.

1234
01:56:06,382 --> 01:56:07,273
Swagger.

1235
01:56:20,859 --> 01:56:23,396
Ve por mi coche. Ve por mi coche.

1236
01:56:43,372 --> 01:56:46,583
Haz algo. !Haz algo!

1237
01:56:54,478 --> 01:56:55,421
¿Donde esta?

1238
01:57:08,568 --> 01:57:09,707
!Debajo del piso!

1239
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:16,536
!Dios mío!

1240
01:57:40,149 --> 01:57:41,677
No necesita matarme.

1241
01:57:42,947 --> 01:57:46,315
No necesita matarme
fueron ellos. !Fueron ellos!

1242
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:51,823
!Maldita sea!
!Espera un minuto!

1243
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:56,589
Espera un minuto. Espera.

1244
01:57:58,424 --> 01:58:02,211
¿Estas loco?
¿Estas completamente loco?

1245
01:58:02,462 --> 01:58:05,253
Soy un senador
de los Estados Unidos.

1246
01:58:05,318 --> 01:58:06,925
Exactamente.
