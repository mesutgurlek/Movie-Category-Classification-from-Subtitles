for the new program.

163
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,885
Why else would Pike
want to see us?

164
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,286
Forget about seniority.

165
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,988
They gave us the newest ship
in the fleet.

166
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,090
SPOCK: I can think of
numerous possibilities.

167
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,926
A five-year mission, Spock!

168
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,162
That's deep space!
That's uncharted territory!

169
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:20,231
Think how incredible that's gonna be.
Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk.

170
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,035
"Uneventful."
KIRK: Admiral?

171
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,337
It's the way you described the survey
of Nibiru in your captain's log.

172
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,339
Uh, yes, sir, I didn't want to waste
your time going over the details.

173
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,441
Tell me more
about this volcano.

174
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,177
Data says
it was highly volatile.

175
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,478
If it were to erupt,
it would wipe out the planet.

176
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,013
Let's hope it doesn't, sir.

177
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,136
Something tells me it won't.

178
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,217
Uh, well, sir,
volatile is all relative.

179
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,219
Maybe our data was off.

180
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,587
Or maybe it didn't erupt

181
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,256
because Mr. Spock detonated
a cold fusion device

182
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,458
inside it right after
a civilization

183
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,195
that's barely
invented the wheel

184
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,097
happened to see a starship
rising out of their ocean!

185
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,233
That is pretty much how
you describe it, is it not?

186
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,868
Admiral...
You filed a report?

187
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,870
Why didn't you tell me?

188
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,239
I incorrectly assumed that you would
be truthful in your captain's log.

189
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,441
Yeah, I would have been if I
didn't have to save your life,

190
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,144
and the very reason
I felt it necessary

191
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,345
to take responsibility
for the actions...

192
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,880
(SCOFFS)
Take responsibility, yeah.

193
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,181
That'd be so noble, pointy,

194
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,616
if you weren't also
throwing me under the bus.

195
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,419
"Pointy"? Is that
a derogatory reference to...

196
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,854
Gentlemen.

197
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,557
Starfleet's mandate is to explore
and observe, not to interfere.

198
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,359
Had the mission gone
according to plan, Admiral,

199
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,493
the indigenous species
would never

200
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,561
have been aware
of our interference.

201
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,263
That's a technicality.

202
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,098
I am Vulcan, sir.
We embrace technicality.

203
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,267
Are you giving me
attitude, Spock?

204
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,535
I'm expressing multiple
attitudes simultaneously, sir.

205
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,870
To which are you referring?

206
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:32,637
Out.

207
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,373

210
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,520
I think so, sir.

211
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:50,922
So tell me what you did wrong.

212
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,364
What's the lesson
to be learned here?

213
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,626
Never trust a Vulcan.

214
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,061
Now, see, you can't even
answer the question. You lied.

215
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,163
On an official report,
you lied.

216
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,398
You think the rules
don't apply to you

'cause you disagree with them.

218
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,635
That's why you talked me into
signing up in the first place.

219
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,370
It's why you gave me your ship.

220
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,939
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you.

221
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,010
And now, I see you haven't
got an ounce of humility.

222
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,111
What was I supposed to do,
let Spock die?

223
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,913
You're missing the point.

224
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,247
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?

225
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,949
I wouldn't have risked
my First Officer's life

226
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,450
in the first place!

227
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,219
You were supposed
to survey a planet,

228
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,488
not alter its destiny!

229
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,556
You violated a dozen
Starfleet regulations

230
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,525
and almost got everyone
under your command killed.

233
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,931
That's your problem,
you think you're infallible!

234

You think you can't
make a mistake.

235

It's a pattern with you!

236
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,669
The rules are for other people!
Some should be.

237
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,370

is you using blind luck

to which I was not invited.

to follow the rules. But
you see, I can't do that.

321
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,865
Where I come from,
if someone saves your life,

322
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,033
you don't stab him in the back.

323
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,402
Vulcans cannot lie.

324
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:52,670
Then I'm talking to the
half-human part of you.

325
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,705
All right?

326
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,375
Do you understand
why I went back for you?

327
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,511
Commander Spock? Frank Abbot, <i>U.S.S.
Bradbury.</i>

328
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:01,612
Guess you're with me.

329
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,782
Yes, Captain.

330
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,991
The truth is

331
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,561
I'm going to miss you.

(SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION)

ABBOT: <i>Admiral Marcus, sir.</i>

334
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,510
Thank you for convening
on such short notice.

335
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:33,611
Be seated.

336
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,083
By now, some of you have heard
what happened in London.

337
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,519
The target was
a Starfleet data archive.

338
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:42,620
Now it's a damned
hole in the ground,

339
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,455
42 men and women are dead.

340
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,923
One hour ago,

341
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,858
I received a message
from a Starfleet officer,

342
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,161
who confessed to
carrying out this attack,

343
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:52,696
that he was being
forced to do it by this man,

344
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,900
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.

345
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,063
And he is the man responsible
for this act of savagery.

346
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,205
For reasons unknown, John
Harrison has just declared

347
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:04,608
a one-man war
against Starfleet.

348
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,745
And under no circumstances
are we to allow this man

349
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:10,548
to escape Federation space.

350
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,916
You here tonight represent
the senior command

351
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,951
of all the vessels
in the region.

352
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,520
And in the name
of those we lost,

353
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,189
you will run this bastard down.

354
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,627
This is a manhunt, pure and
simple, so let's get to work.

355
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,596
Earth's perimeter sensors
have not detected

356
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,097
any warp signatures
leaving the system,

357
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,180
so we know he can't be far.

358
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,169
You will park your ships
in a blockade formation

359
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,472
then deploy search vehicles
and landing parties

360
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,875
to run down every lead.

361
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,510
This man has shown willingness
to kill innocent people,

362
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:42,079
so the rules of engagement
are simple.

363
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,949
If you come across this man
and fear for your life

364
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,084
or the lives of those nearby,

365
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,020
you are authorized to
use deadly force on sight.

366
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,089
What's in the bag?
James, not now.

367
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,991
It doesn't seem odd to you
that he'd target an archive?

368
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,726
It's like bombing a library.

369
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,761
Chris?
Everything okay there?

370
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:00,531
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk
is just acclimating

371
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,500
to his new position
as First Officer.

372
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,901
You got something to say,
Kirk, say it.

373
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,236
Tomorrow's too late.

374
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,740
I'm fine, sir.
My apologies.

375
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,275
Spit it out, son.
Don't be shy.

376
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,746
Why the archive?

377
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,148
All that information
is public record.

378
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,711
If he really wanted
to damage Starfleet,

379
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,921
this could just
be the beginning.

380
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,823
The beginning of what,
Mr. Kirk?

381
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,759
Sir, in the event of an
attack, protocol mandates

Is he defecting?
Uh, we're not sure, sir.

it'd be all-out war.

Please, sir.

All-out war with the Klingons
is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

If you ask me,
it's already begun.

You park on the edge
of the Neutral Zone,

481
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,970
you lock onto
Harrison's position,

482
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:56,239
you fire, you kill him
and you haul ass.

Mr. Spock as my First Officer.

484

487
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,357
Where were you?
For what?

488
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,258
Your medical exam.

in a damn firefight.

I'm fine, Bones.

Mr. Spock. (GRUNTS)

494
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,643
The <i>Enterprise</i> should be
ready for launch

495
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,479
by the time we arrive.

496
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,280
Good. Good.
Captain.

497
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,890
Thank you for requesting
my reinstatement.

498
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,520
You're welcome.

499
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,224
As I am again your First
Officer, it is now my duty

500
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:48,986
to strongly object
to our mission parameters.

501
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:53,663
There is no Starfleet regulation that
condemns a man to die without a trial,

502
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:56,433
something you and Admiral
Marcus are forgetting.

503
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,769
Also, preemptively
firing torpedoes

504
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,470
at the Klingon homeworld
goes against...

505
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,172
You yourself said
the area's uninhabited.

506
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,535
There's only gonna be
one casualty.

507
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:07,244
Our orders have nothing to do
with Starfleet regulation.

508
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,812
Wait a minute. We're firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

509
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:12,349
Regulations aside, this
action is morally wrong.

510
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,584
Regulations aside, pulling your ass
out of a volcano was morally right.

511
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,719
And I didn't win
any points for that.

512
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:19,056
I'm not gonna take
ethics lessons from a robot!

513
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,390
Reverting to name-calling
suggests that you are defensive

514
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,825
and therefore
find my opinion valid.

515
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,493
I wasn't asking
for your opinion.

516
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,796
Bones, get that thing
off my face.

517
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:28,265
SPOCK: Captain, our mission could
start a war with the Klingons

518
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,333
and it is, by its very
definition, immoral.

519
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,169
Perhaps you should
take the requisite time

520
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,337
to arrive at this
conclusion for yourself.

521
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,305

522

Science Officer Wallace.

523
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,771
I've been assigned to the
<i>Enterprise by Admiral Marcus.</i>

524
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,345
These are my transfer orders.

525
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:45,182
You requested an additional
science officer, Captain?

526
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,416
I wish I had.

527
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,787
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."

528
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,389
"Doctorate in applied physics"

529
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:55,158
"specializing in
advanced weaponry."

530
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,320
SPOCK: Impressive credentials.

531
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,195
Thank you.

532
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,463
But redundant now that I am
back aboard the <i>Enterprise.</i>

533
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,231
And yet, the more the merrier.

534
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,566
Have a seat, Doctor.
Thank you.

535
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,238

stand by for lift-off.

536
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,895
SCOTTY: No!
I'm not signing anything!

537
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,164
Now, get these bloody things
off my ship! Captain!

538
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,499
KIRK: Is there a problem,
Mr. Scott?

539
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,567
Aye, sir. I was just
explaining to this gentleman

540
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,836
that I cannot authorize any
weapons on board this ship

541
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,271
without knowing
what's inside them.

542
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:42,772
Mr. Scott raises
yet another point...

543
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:43,673
Report to the bridge.

544
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,742
Captain.

545
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,577
Mr. Scott,
I understand your concerns,

546
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,880
but we need these
torpedoes on board.

547
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:52,382
Due respect, sir, but photon
torpedoes run on fuel.

548
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,151
Now, I cannot detect
the type of fuel

549
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,652
that's in the compartments
on these torpedoes

550
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,187
because it's shielded.

551
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,589
Now, I asked for the
specifications, but he said...

552
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,525
It's classified.
It's classified.

553
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,426
So I said,
"No specs, no signature!"

554
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,262
SULU: Captain.

555
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,364
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.

556
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,432
Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
Yes, sir.

557
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,715
Now if you'll excuse me, sir,
I have a warp core to prime.

558
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,904
Get down!

559
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,572
Jim, your vitals are way off.

560
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,941
Report to the med bay.
Scotty!

561
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,843
I need you to approve
those weapons.

562
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,412
I don't have time
for a lecture, Scotty.

563
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,448
Do you know what this is?
It's a warp core.

564
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,518
It's a radioactive catastrophe
waiting to happen.

565
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,620
A subtle shift
in magnetic output

566
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,323
from, say, firing one or
more of six dozen torpedoes

567
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,192
with an unknown payload

568
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,426
could set off a chain
reaction which would kill

569
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,628
every living thing
on this ship.

570
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,830
Letting those torpedoes on board
the <i>Enterprise is the last straw!</i>

571
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,766
What was the first straw?
What was the...

572
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:44,801
There are plenty of straws.

573
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,604
How about Starfleet confiscating
my transwarp equation?

574
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,706
And now some madman's using
it to hop across the galaxy!

575
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,707
Where do you think
he got it from?

576
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,275
We have our orders, Scotty!

577
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,544
That's what scares me.

578
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,947
This is clearly
a military operation.

579
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:58,815
Is that what we are now?

580
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,178

we were explorers.

that's an order.

582
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,289
Right, well,
you leave me no choice

583
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,657
but to resign my duties.

584
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,659
Oh, come on, Scotty.

585
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,328
You're giving me no choice, sir.
I will not stand by...

586
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,529
You're not giving me
much of a choice...

587
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:13,663
Will you just make an
exception and sign...

588
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:14,764
Do you accept
my resignation or not?

589
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,433
I do!

590

It is true I chose

01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,273
Are you out of
your corn-fed mind?

951
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,208
You're not actually going
to listen to this guy?

952
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,410
He killed Pike,
he almost killed you,

953
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,312
and now you think it's a good
idea to pop open a torpedo

954
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:58,480
because he dared you to.

955
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:00,849
Why did he
save our lives, Bones?

956
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,317
The Doctor does
have a point, Captain.

957
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,752
Don't agree with me, Spock.

958
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:04,954
It makes me very uncomfortable.

959
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,221
Perhaps you too should learn

960
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,023
to govern your emotions,
Doctor.

961
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:09,257
In this situation,
logic dictates...

962
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:11,727
Logic? Oh, my God!
There's a maniac

963
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:13,095
trying to make us blow up
our own damn ship and...

964
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:14,863
That's not it. I don't
know why he surrendered,

965
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:16,832
but that's not it.

966
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:19,034
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo.
The question is how.

967
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:20,902
BONES: But, Jim,
without Mr. Scott on board,

968
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,270
who exactly is qualified

969
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:24,740
to just pop open a four-ton
stick of dynamite?

970
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:26,208
The Admiral's daughter
appeared to have interest

971
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,310
in the torpedoes and she
is a weapons specialist.

972
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:30,011
Perhaps she could be
of some use.

973
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,414
What Admiral's daughter?

974
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:35,183
Carol Marcus.
Your new science officer

975
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:36,786
concealed her identity
to board the ship.

976
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,955
When were you
going to tell me that?

977
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:42,023
When it became relevant.
As it just did.

978
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:43,525
Are the torpedoes
in the weapons bay?

979
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:45,360
Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?

980
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:46,828
I don't know. That's
why I forged my transfer

981
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,063
onto your ship to find out why.

982
01:02:48,065 --> 01:02:50,065
I do apologize for that.

983
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:52,467
By the way, if I caused you
any problems, I am sorry.

984
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:53,902
I'm Carol Marcus.

985
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,003
James Kirk.

986
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:55,904
Torpedoes.

987
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,875
My father gave me access
to every program he oversaw,

988
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:02,344
then I heard he was developing
these prototype torpedoes.

989
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:04,012
Uh-huh. When I went to
confront him about it,

990
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:06,248
he wouldn't even see me.

991
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,016
That's when I discovered the
torpedoes had disappeared

992
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:10,485
from all official records.

993
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,888
And then he gave them to me.

994
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,357
You're much cleverer than your
reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

995
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,392
I have a reputation?

996
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:18,560
Yes, you do. I'm a friend
of Christine Chapel's.

997

(INSTRUMENTS HUMMING)

998
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:21,530
Christine, yes.
How is she?

999
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:23,365
She transferred to the
outer frontier to be a nurse.

1000
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:24,366
She's much happier now.

1001
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:26,101
That's good.

1002
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:27,944
You have no idea who I'm
talking about, do you?

1003
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,806
What... What are
we doing in here?

1004
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,874
Is this shuttle prepped to fly?
Of course it is.

1005
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,197
Would you please turn around?
Why?

1006
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,344
Just turn around.

1007
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,081
It's too dangerous
to try and open

1008
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,184
one of these torpedoes
on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

1009
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:44,553
But there is
a nearby planetoid.

1010
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:46,321
I can open one up there.

1011
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,956
But I will need some help.

1012
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,891
Turn around.

1013
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,227

01:03:57,568 --> 01:04:00,268
have Doctors Marcus and McCoy
landed on the planetoid yet?

1017
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,071
SULU: Yes, sir. They're moving
the torpedo into position now.

1018
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:04,753
KIRK: Good. Any activity
from the Klingons?

1019
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,608
SULU: Not yet.

1020
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,771
But if we're stuck here much
longer, they will find us.

1021

Lieutenant Uhura,
did you let Starfleet know

1022
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:12,614
we have Harrison in custody?

Yes, sir.

Mr. Chekov,
give me some good news.

1027
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:25,227

Bones, thanks for helping out.

1034
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,913
Dr. Marcus asked for the
steadiest hands on the ship.

1035
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:46,448
You know, when I dreamt
about being stuck

on a deserted planet
with a gorgeous woman,

there was no torpedo!

<i>you are not there to flirt.</i>

1040
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:55,143
So how can these legendary

CAROL: To understand how
powerful these weapons are,

1043
01:04:58,428 --> 01:04:59,995
we need to open the warhead.

1044
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,429
To do that, we need to
access the fuel compartment.

1045
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:02,898
Unfortunately for us,

1046
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,200
the warheads on these
weapons are live.

bundle of fiber optic cables

1053
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:19,381
against the inner casing.

1054
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:21,449
You'll need to cut
the 23rd wire down.

1055
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:23,018
Whatever you do,
do not touch anything else.

1104
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,494
in all those torpedoes,
Captain.

1105
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:53,728
I put them there.

1106
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:58,273
Who the hell are you?

1107
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,906
A remnant of a time long past.

1108
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,710
Genetically engineered
to be superior

1109
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:11,246
so as to lead others
to peace in a world at war.

1110
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:17,385
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced into exile.

1111
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,455
For centuries we slept,

1112
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,227
hoping when we awoke,
things would be different.

1113
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:28,463
But as a result
of the destruction of Vulcan,

1114
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,532
your Starfleet began
to aggressively search

1115
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:32,233
distant quadrants of space.

1116
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:34,802
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.

1117
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,671
KIRK: I looked up
"John Harrison."

1118
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,206
Until a year ago,
he didn't exist.

1119
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,275
John Harrison was a fiction

1120
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:41,943
created the moment I was awoken

1121
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:45,413
by your Admiral Marcus
to help him advance his cause.

1122
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:48,383
A smokescreen
to conceal my true identity.

1123
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,719
My name is,

1124
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,221
Khan.

1125
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,529
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

1126
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,200
ask a 300-year-old
frozen man for help?

1127
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:07,902
Because I am better.

1128
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:10,205
At what?
Everything.

1129
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,209
Alexander Marcus
needed to respond to

1130
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,277
an uncivilized threat
in a civilized time

1131
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,413
and for that
he needed a warrior's mind.

1132
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:20,281
My mind.

1133
01:10:20,283 --> 01:10:22,483
To design weapons and warships.

1134
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:24,586
SPOCK: You are suggesting
the Admiral

1135
01:10:24,588 --> 01:10:26,621
violated every regulation
he vowed to uphold

1136
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:28,790
simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

1137
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:31,426
He wanted to exploit
my savagery.

1138
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:34,229
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

1139
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:35,797
You... You can't
even break a rule.

1140
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:37,999
How would you be
expected to break bone?

1141
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:42,637
Marcus used me
to design weapons.

1142
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:45,406
To help him realize his vision
of a militarized Starfleet.

1143
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,476
He sent you
to use those weapons.

1144
01:10:48,478 --> 01:10:51,879
To fire my torpedoes
on an unsuspecting planet.

1145
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,284
And then he purposely
crippled your ship

1146
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:59,854
in enemy space, leading to
one inevitable outcome.

1147
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:01,456
The Klingons
would come searching

1148
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:03,491
for whomever was responsible,

1149
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:05,793
and you would have
no chance of escape.

1150
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:09,964
Marcus would finally
have the war he talked about.

1151
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:11,633
The war he always wanted.

1152
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,635
No. No.

1153
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:18,873
I watched you open fire in a room
full of unarmed Starfleet officers.

1154
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,808
You killed them in cold blood!

1155
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,444
Marcus took my crew from me.

1156
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,747
You are a murderer!

1157
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:27,982
He used my friends
to control me.

1158
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:35,490
I tried to smuggle them
to safety

1159
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:36,924
by concealing them
in the very weapons

1160
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:38,593
I had designed,

1161
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,397
but I was discovered.

1162
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:47,402
I had no choice
but to escape alone.

1163
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:53,541
And when I did, I had
every reason to suspect

1164
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:57,845
that Marcus had killed
every single one

1165
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:00,848
of the people I hold most dear.

1166
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,555
So I responded in kind.

1167
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,827
My crew

1168
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:16,731
is my family, Kirk.

1169
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:19,734
Is there anything you would
not do for your family?

give him to me

(INJECTION WHIRS)

1883
01:56:49,169 --> 01:56:50,435
Get this guy
out of the cryo tube.

1884
01:56:50,437 --> 01:56:52,004
Keep him in an induced coma.

1885
01:56:52,006 --> 01:56:53,705
We're gonna put Kirk inside.

1886
01:56:53,707 --> 01:56:55,307
It's our only chance to
preserve his brain function.

1887
01:56:55,309 --> 01:56:56,775
How much of Khan's blood
is left?

1888
01:56:56,777 --> 01:56:57,743
None.

1889
01:56:59,112 --> 01:57:01,546
<i>Enterprise</i> to Spock. Spock!

McCoy to bridge.

1895
01:58:09,349 --> 01:58:12,117
I can't reach Spock.
I need Khan alive.

1896
01:58:12,119 --> 01:58:14,586
You get that son of a bitch
back on board right now!

1897
01:58:15,721 --> 01:58:17,622
I think he can save Kirk.

1898
01:58:17,624 --> 01:58:19,257
Can we beam them up
to the ship?

1899
01:58:19,259 --> 01:58:21,326
Ah, they keep moving! I can't
get a lock on either of them.

1900
01:58:21,328 --> 01:58:22,394
Can you beam someone down?

(SCREAMS) Spock!

Spock!

1905
01:59:07,406 --> 01:59:10,175
Spock, stop! Stop!

1906
01:59:10,177 --> 01:59:11,743
He's our only chance
to save Kirk!

1907

GEORGE: <i>What is it?</i>
WINONA: <i>It's a boy.</i>

1908
01:59:24,525 --> 01:59:28,326
PIKE: <i>Your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.</i>

1909
01:59:28,328 --> 01:59:31,630
<i>He saved 800 lives.

(GASPS)

1911
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:44,476
Oh, don't be so melodramatic.
You were barely dead.

1912
01:59:44,478 --> 01:59:46,912
It was the transfusion
that really took its toll.

1913
01:59:46,914 --> 01:59:47,779
You were out cold
for two weeks.

1914
01:59:47,781 --> 01:59:49,481
Transfusion?

1915
01:59:49,483 --> 01:59:51,583
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.

1916
01:59:52,451 --> 01:59:53,818
Khan?

1917
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:55,487
Once we caught him,

1918
01:59:55,489 --> 01:59:58,223
I synthesized a serum
from his superblood.

1919
01:59:58,225 --> 02:00:00,559
Tell me, are you feeling,
uh, homicidal?

1920
02:00:00,561 --> 02:00:02,327
Power mad? Despotic?

1921
02:00:02,329 --> 02:00:03,728
No more than usual.

1922
02:00:04,463 --> 02:00:05,397
How'd you catch him?

1923
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:07,199
I didn't.

1924
02:00:16,209 --> 02:00:18,510
You saved my life.

1925
02:00:18,512 --> 02:00:20,673
Uhura and I had something to
do with it, too, you know.

1926
02:00:22,582 --> 02:00:24,716
You saved my life, Captain.
And the lives...

1927
02:00:24,718 --> 02:00:25,884
Spock, just...

1928
02:00:27,653 --> 02:00:28,853
Thank you.

1929
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:32,457
You are welcome, Jim.

KIRK: <i>There will always be
those who mean to do us ha.</i>

1931
02:00:48,708 --> 02:00:51,409
<i>To stop them,</i>

1932
02:00:51,411 --> 02:00:54,512
<i>we risk awakening the same
evil within ourselves.</i>

1933
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:03,722
<i>Our first instinct
is to seek revenge</i>

1934
02:01:03,724 --> 02:01:05,523
<i>when those we love
are taken from us.</i>

1935
02:01:08,861 --> 02:01:10,395
<i>But that's not who we are.</i>

1936
02:01:12,031 --> 02:01:14,032
<i>We are here today</i>

1937
02:01:14,034 --> 02:01:17,302
<i>to rechristen
the U.S.S. Enterprise,</i>

1938
02:01:17,304 --> 02:01:19,571
<i>and to honor those
who lost their lives</i>

1939
02:01:20,673 --> 02:01:23,275
<i>nearly one year ago.</i>

1940
02:01:23,277 --> 02:01:25,477
<i>When Christopher Pike
first gave me his ship</i>

1941
02:01:25,479 --> 02:01:27,345
<i>he had me recite
the Captain's Oath,</i>

1942
02:01:28,648 --> 02:01:30,949
<i>words I didn't appreciate
at the time.</i>

1943
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:34,719
<i>Now I see them as a call
for us to remember</i>

1944
02:01:35,755 --> 02:01:37,455
<i>who we once were,</i>

1945
02:01:39,558 --> 02:01:41,693
<i>and who we must be again.</i>

1946
02:01:43,029 --> 02:01:44,496
<i>And those words?</i>

1947
02:01:45,498 --> 02:01:49,401
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1948
02:01:49,403 --> 02:01:52,437
<i>These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.</i>

1949
02:01:53,506 --> 02:01:55,473
<i>Her five-year mission,</i>

1950
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:58,343
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

1951
02:01:58,345 --> 02:02:02,480
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

1952
02:02:02,482 --> 02:02:05,650
<i>to boldly go
where no one has gone before.</i>

1953
02:02:08,888 --> 02:02:10,588
CHEKOV: Captain on the bridge.

1954
02:02:14,093 --> 02:02:16,461
It's hard to get out of it
once you've had a taste,

1955
02:02:16,463 --> 02:02:17,962
isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1956
02:02:17,964 --> 02:02:20,365
"Captain" does have
a nice ring to it.

1957
02:02:20,367 --> 02:02:21,533
Chair's all yours, sir.

1958
02:02:23,502 --> 02:02:25,103
Mr. Scott.

<i>How's our core?</i>

1960
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:28,340
Purring like a kitten, Captain.

1961
02:02:28,342 --> 02:02:29,874
She's ready for a long journey.

1962
02:02:30,376 --> 02:02:31,810
<i>Excellent.</i>

1963
02:02:31,812 --> 02:02:33,912
Come on, Bones!
It's gonna be fun.

1964
02:02:35,614 --> 02:02:38,783
Five years in space.
God help me.

1965
02:02:38,785 --> 02:02:40,051
Dr. Marcus.

1966
02:02:41,954 --> 02:02:43,874
Uh... I'm glad you could be
a part of the family.

1967
02:02:44,056 --> 02:02:45,423
It's nice to have a family.

1968

KIRK: Spock.

1969
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:50,495
Captain.

1970
02:02:53,566 --> 02:02:54,833
Where shall we go?

1971
02:02:56,802 --> 02:02:59,437
As a mission of this duration
has never been attempted,

1972
02:03:01,807 --> 02:03:03,842
I defer to your
good judgment, Captain.

1973
02:03:13,018 --> 02:03:15,453
Mr. Sulu, take us out.

1974
02:03:15,855 --> 02:03:16,921
Aye, Captain.
