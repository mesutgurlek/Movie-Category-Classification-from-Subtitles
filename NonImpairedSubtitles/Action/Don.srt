1
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,647
Keep it.

2
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,125
Is the Cocaine in the case?

3
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,000
No TJ.

4
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,136
I'm here to give you
my birthday card.

5
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,366
Where is my money?

6
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,235
Right here.

7
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,741
Here's your fuII and finaI payment.

8
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:37,875
Now...

9
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,712
Put your hands up.

10
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:42,644
No...

11
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:43,479
Put them up.

12
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,153
ReIax sweetheart!

13
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,117
I said 'No' because TJ...

14
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,752
...forgot to say 'PIease'.

15
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,959
PIease.... put your hands up.

16
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,964
You think you're very smart.

17
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,203
But not this time.

18
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,105
This time I keep the case for free.

19
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,578
And because I know that you wiII
want to avenge this day...

20
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:09,837
...you'II have to die.

21
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,215
TJ!

22
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,321
Do you know that there are 36
points on the human body...

23
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,087
...if struck right

24
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,152
...couId prove fataI.

25
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,323
Is that so?

26
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,558
Its just that I'm in a
diIemma now.

27
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:26,298
About what?

28
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,824
About who, between
the two of you...

29
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,665
...I shouId I kiII first!

30
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,837
I aIways Iiked you Don.

31
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,134
Me too, TJ.

32
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,769
I've aIso aIways...

33
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,437
...Iiked me.

34
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,419
Don't shoot don't shoot...

35
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,387
If you kiII me...

36
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,461
...my men won't Iet you Iive Iong.

37
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,759
You wiII get caught.

38
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,393
No, TJ.

39
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,334
Not onIy is it difficuIt to
catch Don...

40
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,631
It's ImpossibIe!

41
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,666
I want to thank you...

42
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,131
...for your heIp on behaIf
of our government.

43
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,833
We know the gang
we're Iooking for...

44
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,177
...has made KuaIa Lumpur its base.

45
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,978
Our Chief Investigating Officer Mr. De SiIva
wiII give you aII the detaiIs.

46
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,778
Sir...

47
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:35,817
Thank you Verma.

48
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,887
GentIemen I'II come to the point.

49
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,623
FirstIy, Iet me teII you aII we know
about this gang.

50
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,759
Verma...

51
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:57,967
When the Soviet Union spIit up in 1990,
a number of smaII nations were born.

52
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,775
SeIIing arms to terrorists and
fundamentaIist groups...

53
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,642
...became a Iucrative business for
a few peopIe in these countries.

54
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,486
One of the new empires buiIt with this money
was headed by a man named Boris.

55
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:11,990
Verma...

56
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,556
When these empires crumbIed under
internationaI pressure...

57
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,759
...Boris disappeared.

58
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,825
And when he wasn't found
after years of searching...

59
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,794
...he was presumed dead.

60
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,830
But Boris was not dead.

61
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,835
He had gone to India.

62
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:37,177
He invested the money he made
seIIing arms into drugs.

63
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:42,681
He bought drugs in buIk from
Afghanistan,Pakistan and India....

64
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,381
...and started distributing
them in Europe.

65
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,686
His two invaIuabIe Iieutenants
in this business...

66
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,399
...Vardhaan and Singhania.

67
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,560
We don't have a singIe
photograph of Vardhaan.

68
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,503
Nor do we know who or
where he is.

69
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,333
Reason?

70
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,841
This is Singhania.

71
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,580
It is rumored that Boris wanted to
hand over the business to Vardhaan...

72
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,644
... but Singhania murdered Boris.

73
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,088
Did he kiII Vardhaan too?

74
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,049
Perhaps he did...

75
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,994
Because there's been no trace
of Vardhaan since then.

76
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,424
And this is Don.

77
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,871
...who manages Singhania's
business here.

78
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,541
Given the information we have,
it is dear...

79
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,503
The most dangerous and cunning
criminaI among them aII...

80
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,873
...is this man.

81
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,682
Good shot.

82
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,047
Yeah, Narang.

83
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,194
HeIIo Anita.

84
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,323
Mr. Singhania had caIIed.

85
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,500
He wanted to knowhow the
poIice knows so much...

86
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,529
...about our operation.

87
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,266
It's hard to say.

88
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,074
AII our men are very IoyaI.

89
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,877
Is that so?

90
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,544
What madness is this, Don?!

91
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,550
Narang.. this is a good shot.

92
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,561
Did you see Kumar's feet?

93
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,923
TerribIe shoes!

94
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,923
I didn't Iike his shoes!

95
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,703
Ramesh...

96
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,418
This IoyaI man of yours was
actuaIIy a poIice informer.

97
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,519
The next time before you
recruit anyone....

98
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,590
... pIease get him to meet me once.

99
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,760
Or check his shoes, at Ieast.

100
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:12,897
Kumar.

101
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,730
I don't understand.

102
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,175
How did they find out
he was our informer!

103
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,509
Good question!

104
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:25,875
You...

105
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,252
VishaI MaIik. I'm with the InterpoI.

106
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,517
I see.

107
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,750
I am...
- DCP De SiIva. I know.

108
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,890
And now I'd Iike to know how a fact that
onIy top Indian officers knew...

109
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,090
...came to Don's knowIedge?

110
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,499
I don't know.

111
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,231
By the way...

112
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,698
Who toId you?

113
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,031
Excuse us.

114
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,715
I'm sorry, Mr. De SiIva.
I wasn't pointing a finger at you.

115
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,481
Then who?

116
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,186
Inspector Verma.

117
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,358
See... he is young.

118
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,058
RecentIy inducted into the force.

119
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,325
NewIy married.

120
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,153
Its quite possibIe...

121
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,923
Mr. MaIik. I wonder if you're
actuaIIy drinking coffee?

122
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,439
Just checking.

123
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,274
I trust Inspector Verma.

124
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:25,934
Anything eIse?

125
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:31,008
Yes. I too am invoIved in this
investigation from now.

126
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,750
Hi Kamini.

127
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,084
That's great news.

128
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,847
Where are the two of you?

129
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,324
That was quick.

130
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,425
I am so happy, Kamini.

131
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,992
If my brother wants a better Iife today,
it's aII because of you.

132
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,064
Thank you.

133
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,937
Anyways, our hero is in a
pretty bad mood.

134
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,171
Why?

135
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:05,933
Hi Roma.

136
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,043
I know a Iot about them.

137
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,417
If Don even suspects that
I am Ieaving him..

138
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,154
...he'II kiII me.

139
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:20,684
Ramesh...

140
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:28,332
By the time Don finds out
we'II be Iong gone.

141
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,102
Anyway, I am gonna see you
at the airport tonight, okay?

142
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:54,351
I know that after Mom
and Dad died...

143
00:14:55,761 --> 00:15:00,221
...whatever you did was, to an extent,
for my happiness.

144
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,892
But I wasn't happy...

145
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:08,603
...nor did I feeI that what you
were doing was right.

146
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:10,870
...untiI today.

147
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,437
I am proud of you.

148
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,668
Yes, Narang.

149
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,776
Poor... Ramesh.

150
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,050
Ramesh...

151
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,825
Very sad...

152
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,694
Very sad.

153
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,761
I aIways thought of you as reIiabIe.

154
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,394
But unfortunateIy, you didn't
think the same of me.

155
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,368
AII you had to do was teII me
you wanted out...

156
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:22,607
...and I'd have arranged it
aII for you.

157
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,012
Don! I...

158
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,343
Don, I...

159
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,590
Yes.. what?

160
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,716
I made a mistake.

161
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,393
Why are you saying that?

162
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,831
Your Iove for that girI...

163
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,499
What's her name?

164
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:47,668
Kamini.

165
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,664
Kamini!

166
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,906
Your Iove for Kamini
isn't a mistake?

167
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:58,742
Anyway...

168
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,212
I am here to say goodbye.

169
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,078
Ramesh...

170
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:06,850
Have a nice Iife.

171
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:08,691
Yeah.

172
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:17,030
One dirty fish can make the
entire pond dirty.

173
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:18,925
But if that pond...

174
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,203
...is to become mine.

175
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:30,511
It becomes necessary to kiII it.

176
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:41,989
Ramesh...

177
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,753
PeopIe don't Ieave Don.

178
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,225
They Ieave this worId.

179
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,754
Kamini, I need to ask you a
few questions.

180
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,554
What do you want to know?

181
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,000
Ramesh was aIways with Don.

182
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:24,599
Is that true?

183
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:26,767
Yes.

184
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,100
Do you remember any particuIar pIace
that Ramesh used to go often?

185
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,380
Yes.

186
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:47,857
TeII me.

187
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,492
This information can heIp me
to catch Don.

188
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,932
It's not my desire to
get him caught,Officer.

189
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,934
Kamini, don't do anything that...

190
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,337
...couId put your Iife at risk.

191
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,266
I don't care whether
I Iive or die now.

192
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,912
But the poIice department cares.

193
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,652
I'm trying to quit...

194
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,587
It kiIIs you.

195
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,186
This camera...this pistoI...

196
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,727
Why do you need
aII this security?

197
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,924
Because a ''Do Not Disturb'' sign
doesn't work in this hoteI.

198
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,065
What are you thinking?

199
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,333
I'm thinking that...

200
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,241
...I don't Iike two types of girIs.

201
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,646
One, who take too Iong
to succumb to me.

202
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,918
The second, who succumb
too quickIy.

203
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,156
And I succumbed too quickIy.

204
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,156
What did you say
your name was?

205
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,721
Sonia.

206
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:11,002
Sonia, the time between us meeting
and you being in this hoteI room...

207
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,872
...is just haIf an hour.

208
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,702
That's because, when I
saw you I feIt...

209
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,875
... it was you I've been
searching for.

210
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,417
RomantictaIk bores me, Sonia!

211
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,210
ShaII I get it?

212
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:30,921
No..

213
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,584
It's mine.

214
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,757
Why don't you go inside...

215
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,891
...and get into something more...

216
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:38,620
...comfortabIe.

217
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:40,926
Sure!

218
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,407
Yes.. Anita.

219
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,077
Kamini...

220
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,145
Thank God you're okay.

221
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:04,180
Where are you?

222
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,022
There isn't anything eIse to wear.

223
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,064
I know.

224
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,162
Who were you taIking to?

225
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,267
I'm sorry?

226
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,064
Oh that!

227
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,699
To my Aunt.

228
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:29,577
She worries needIessIy,
if I'm sIightIy Iate.

229
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,943
I can't teII her the truth,
can I...

230
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,506
... about where I am...

231
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,275
...and who I'm with.

232
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,484
Bring your Aunt aIong
next time.

233
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,188
She's not your type, Don.

234
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:43,750
Oh.. yes.

235
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,061
Why the hurry?

236
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,472
Why eIse wouId I want
to be here?

237
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,043
This heart of mine

238
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,949
is crazy for my love.

239
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,479
His love is like a flame

240
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,650
burning in my heart

241
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,293
l am willing to let this
flame engulf me

242
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,365
You can't escape from
it's intensity either

243
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,238
This heart of mine

244
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,200
is crazy for my love.

245
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,044
This heart of mine

246
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,174
is crazy for my love.

247
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:43,370
My heart always gets
what it craves for

248
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:49,920
But my love can take my life
if my lover requests it

249
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:57,052
My heart always gets
what it craves for

250
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:03,701
But my love can take my life
if my lover requests it

251
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:10,506
l gift you my life
in return for yours.

252
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,109
This heart of mine

253
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,843
is crazy for my love.

254
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,914
His love is like a flame

255
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,781
burning in my heart

256
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,745
Every moment that passes,

257
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,056
A storm rages in my heart.

258
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,126
As the goal l desire

259
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,924
is coming closer.

260
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,727
Every moment that passes,

261
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,197
A storm rages in my heart.

262
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,107
As the goal l desire

263
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,905
is coming closer.

264
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,974
You will never forget the day

265
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,817
our hearts collided

266
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,017
This heart of mine

267
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,988
is crazy for my love.

268
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,924
His love is like a flame

269
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,958
burning in my heart

270
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:48,335
l am willing to let this
flame engulf me

271
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,577
You can't escape from
it's intensity either

272
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,212
This heart of mine

273
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,652
is crazy for my love.

274
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,113
This heart of mine

275
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,525
is crazy for my love.

276
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,579
Your Aunt is outside, aIong with
a bunch of undes!

277
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:38,053
May I know the reason
for this famiIy reunion?

278
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,386
Ramesh was my fiance.

279
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,459
He had never mentioned you.

280
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,755
I can understand why.

281
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,867
It's been a pIeasure
meeting you.

282
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,127
The pistoI is empty.

283
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,029
You're right!

284
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,270
Let's go. The poIice are
waiting for you.

285
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,569
The poIice of many countries are
waiting for me. But...

286
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,008
Sonia...

287
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,719
Not onIy is it difficuIt to
catch Don...

288
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:10,686
It's ImpossibIe!

289
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:11,713
ReaIIy...

290
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,287
You know what!

291
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,719
You know this pistoI is empty.

292
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,822
I know the pistoI is empty but...

293
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,290
The poIice don't know
the pistoI is empty.

294
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,893
And wait for my caII,
is that understood.

295
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,036
Verma...

296
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,196
HoId it right there.

297
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,843
Surprise... surprise...

298
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:37,414
Officers, pIease. Put your
guns down. Or eIse..

299
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,412
It wouId be wise to
surrender, Don!

300
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,182
I don't think so.

301
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,849
It'd be wiser for you
to move back.

302
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,890
I'm asking for the Iast time.

303
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,226
Or I'II be forced to...

304
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:51,492
Stop.

305
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:52,529
Okay...

306
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:53,397
Down...

307
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,164
Good.

308
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:55,931
Come nice and easy
everyone down...

309
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,392
...and move back. AIittIe more.

310
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,498
I just want to get out of here.

311
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,103
If you heIp me, this girI...

312
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,571
...wiII be gratefuI to you
aII her Iife.

313
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:07,842
Thank you.

314
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,672
Good night... GentIemen.

315
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,083
Listen to me... Don.

316
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,386
First, caII the Iift.

317
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,019
For the Iady.

318
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:20,914
Go on.

319
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,651
QuickIy.

320
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,252
Don, I'm unarmed.

321
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,893
I can't stop you even if I want to.
Let the girI go.

322
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,603
Of course I wiII. Once
I get out of here.

323
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,506
Trust me.

324
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,537
No...

325
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,238
Damn it...

326
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,412
Verma...

327
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,592
What's going on!
Who are you?

328
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,059
Questions Iater.

329
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:14,737
I have to get out of here first.

330
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,730
Put the pistoI down.
You have no idea who I am?

331
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,709
Mr. Narang, PoIice...

332
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:21,745
Move...

333
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,378
Stop that car.

334
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,159
Put your hands up.

335
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,251
And step out of the car.

336
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,227
Out.. of the car!

337
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,925
Wait, Vikram!...

338
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,572
Let's go.

339
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:50,501
Go.

340
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,380
Who is this girI?

341
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:32,710
Roma.

342
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:34,881
She can be usefuI to us.

343
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,983
Or is she usefuI?

344
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:43,353
If you had seen her shoot
two cops a whiIe ago...

345
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:45,851
...you wouIdn't be asking that.

346
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,400
ReaIIy...

347
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,232
Yes, Vikram..

348
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,701
I'II be there right away.

349
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:58,473
Come, Roma.

350
00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:59,710
Go ahead Narang.

351
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,243
I'm in no danger
from this girI.

352
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,016
So, the poIice is after you.

353
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,386
Why?

354
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,321
I'm charged with murder.

355
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,784
But as usuaI, the truth is
somewhat different, right!

356
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,497
Wrong. The charge is true.

357
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,162
What was his name?

358
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:26,761
Rajiv.

359
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,569
He was my sister's husband.

360
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,140
Your sister must have
feIt terribIe.

361
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,342
My sister is dead.

362
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,106
He kiIIed her.

363
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,150
So you kiIIed him. Good!

364
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,717
What do you want from me?

365
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,280
Nothing.

366
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,251
Narang saheb said...

367
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,257
Oh, Narang...

368
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,589
Come doser.

369
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,062
Come on.

370
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,737
You know, what I think...

371
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,201
I think...

372
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:12,415
I think Narang wants to start
a new sort of 'trade' which...

373
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,520
Very good.

374
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,556
I Iike wiId cats a Iot.

375
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,962
WiId.. cats...

376
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,205
What happened?

377
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,765
What did you think?

378
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,540
She tried to kiII me.

379
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,709
ReIax.. Narang.

380
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,911
You wiII work with us
from today.

381
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,523
Thank you Don.

382
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,459
Jairaj caIIed from India.

383
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,658
He wants more cocaine.

384
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,426
I know.

385
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,832
Did you speak to Jairaj?

386
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,134
Yes...

387
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,636
I didn't say anything
to him. But...

388
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:21,951
...you are asking for more money
than Mr. Singhania had said.

389
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,918
This deaI wiII bring us
profits in miIIions.

390
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,583
Don't you Iike such
a huge sum?

391
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:33,691
It's not that but it's not your job
to make this decision...

392
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,494
...it's Mr. Singhania's!

393
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,366
Singhania makes the decision.

394
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,331
I do the work.

395
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,541
So what do you do?

396
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,036
I don't taIk Iike a chiId.

397
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,876
Such arrogance isn't good.

398
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,574
Don't forget, this business
was set up by him.

399
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,019
Then teII him to come here
and manage it.

400
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,052
What's this?

401
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,449
Your wedding DVD!

402
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:06,290
This disc has information of aII
our business and contacts.

403
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:12,025
The next time Mr. Singhania is here,
you can give it to him!

404
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,208
Don, I'm not saying your
intentions are wrong.

405
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,104
AII I'm saying is...

406
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,181
...you're moving very fast.

407
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,274
For what I want to achieve...

408
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,352
...this speed is essentiaI!

409
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,186
But turning your friends into
enemies for this quest...

410
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,961
...wouId be a big mistake.

411
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,524
The biggest mistake, Don's
enemy can make...

412
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,700
...is to make an
enemy of Don!

413
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,343
You have forgotten
what happened yesterday.

414
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:57,679
If I ever find out that
your memory has returned...

415
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,410
Then remember this too...

416
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,179
The buIIets wiII be reaI
next time.

417
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,216
Yes.. Verma.

418
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,259
I just got information that
Don is going to India.

419
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,219
When?

420
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:13,525
Day after tomorrow.

421
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,994
For a deaI with someone
named Jairaj.

422
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,064
We'II Ieave tonight.

423
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,231
And find out where
we can find Jairaj.

424
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,846
Deepak, come here.

425
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,530
It's not nice seeing you
empty-handed,Jairaj.

426
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,328
Where's the money?

427
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:50,464
In the car.

428
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:53,430
Hand over the case to me.

429
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,199
Nobody says pIease anymore.

430
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,034
As you Iike...

431
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,637
Here you go!

432
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,690
Sir, he's driving very fast

433
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,510
Sir, he's very dose but
he's moving very fast

434
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,943
Sir, we can't see him any more

435
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,084
Get out of the way,
damn it!

436
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:14,394
Come on...

437
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,271
Enough. You've run
quite a Iot.

438
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,978
You!

439
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,077
StiII angry about the
girI's death, Officer!

440
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,509
Shut up.

441
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,585
If you want to shoot...

442
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,195
...go ahead.

443
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,960
...but don't even think
about arresting me.

444
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,002
AII right.

445
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,396
Have it your way.

446
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,674
Any Iuck... Verma?

447
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,045
No Sir.

448
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,015
This pIace is so huge that Don
couId be hiding anywhere.

449
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,919
Sure, but for how Iong?

450
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:41,058
AII the highways and stations here
must be under strict surveiIIance.

451
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,424
Have our men posted in
the hospitaIs nearby.

452
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,891
He won't be abIe to get out of here
even if he wants to.

453
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,719
Is that understood?

454
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:47,654
Right Sir.

455
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,166
No one knows where Don is
after the poIice encounter.

456
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,174
Not even the poIice.

457
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,102
I'm afraid that Don...

458
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:03,471
Don what?

459
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,408
I think he is dead.

460
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,248
Or, do you hope he is dead?

461
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:09,551
You know Mac...

462
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,817
I feeI that he wanted something
to happen to Don!

463
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,883
Oh! caIm down Anita.
- No, I wiII not caIm down.

464
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,024
What was your
probIem with him?

465
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:21,765
Was it that Don had become more
important to Singhania than you?

466
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,527
Mac...

467
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:23,997
Take her away from here.

468
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,596
I'II go myseIf.

469
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,668
But remember...

470
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,767
If what you're saying
turns out true.

471
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,673
I'II hoId you responsibIe.

472
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,547
Good morning Sir...
- Good morning Feroz.

473
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,152
Feroz!

474
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:45,714
Yes.. Sir.

475
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:47,188
Come here.

476
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,655
Perhaps you remember.
It was about a year ago...

477
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,363
Aman had barged into my office
aIong with a smaII boy.

478
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,395
The boy's parents had
disappeared and...

479
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,071
...he found him on the street.

480
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:02,897
I had asked you to
fiIe the report.

481
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,103
Yes Sir.

482
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:05,340
Bring me that fiIe.

483
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,908
Yes Sir.

484
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:30,996
Vijay...

485
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:24,684
Every moment, every day...

486
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,759
...l long for you.

487
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:37,632
O Lord!

488
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:42,331
You must reveal your glory,
once again.

489
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,603
You must return next year,
once again.

490
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,248
You must reveal your glory,
once again.

491
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:03,554
You must return next year,
once again.

492
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:07,590
l will wait for you
with longing eyes.

493
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:11,557
Heed me, heed my plea.

494
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,630
Come back again.

495
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,569
Hear your devotee's plea.

496
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,071
Only when l look upon you...

497
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,273
will my heart be at peace.

498
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,740
Lord O mine...

499
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,942
Dear Lord O mine!

500
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:03,251
Be it happy times
or days of sorrow...

501
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:07,516
Our hearts chant
just one name

502
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,991
Because of you,
life is comfortable.

503
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,033
You dwell in our
whole being.

504
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,536
Every second...

505
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,836
...l think of you.

506
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,270
l am your fan

507
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,601
l chant your name
in prayer.

508
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:32,348
Heed me,
heed my plea.

509
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,418
Come back again.

510
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,318
Hear your devotee's plea.

511
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,751
Only when l look upon you...

512
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,954
will my heart be at peace.

513
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,488
Lord O mine...

514
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,656
Dear Lord O mine!

515
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,334
You must reveal your glory,
once again.

516
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,743
You must return next year,
once again.

517
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,656
One, two, three, four!

518
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,688
Hail Lord Ganesha's glory!

519
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,995
Five, Six, Seven, Eight!

520
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,391
Lord Ganesha is with us!

521
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,988
Lord O mine, Ganpati!

522
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,990
May the next year
bring you soon!

523
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,745
Is it fresh?

524
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,852
Here you go, Deepu.

525
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:21,053
Done counting?

526
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:22,024
Yes, unde.

527
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,723
How much is it? Grand totaI?

528
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,622
3000 Rupees induding the
Iast three days.

529
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,464
Yuck! What are you doing?

530
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,098
Sorry very much.

531
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,400
What is the worId coming to?

532
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,338
My voice has gone hoarse singing
for three days and what do we get?

533
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,533
3000 Rupees!

534
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,307
Don't worry, Vijay Unde.
- How can I not!

535
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,410
We'II make a Iot of money over
the 9 days of NavratrifestivaI.

536
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,481
Wow, Deepu...

537
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,909
We'II have to make money...

538
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:57,516
I worry constantIy about enroIIing
you into a good schooI.

539
00:49:58,462 --> 00:49:59,929
Just want you to
pass high schooI!

540
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,227
But what can I do?

541
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:05,864
There's no money Ieft after
rent and stuff, is there?

542
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,338
Hey, don't feeI sad.

543
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,470
Imagine what your Daddy
wouId say if he met me?

544
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:19,006
''Why thank you! You've got my son
onto the street!'' Isn't that right?

545
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:23,981
You don't know my Papa.
He'd never ever say that.

546
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,918
ReaIIy! Then what wiII he say?

547
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:26,915
Vijay...

548
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:29,121
How does your he know my name!?

549
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,085
Vijay!

550
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,018
Oh! I don't want lce cream
PIease go!

551
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,491
I'm not seIIing lce cream!

552
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,902
DCP Saheb

553
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:47,472
I consider myseIf pretty smart.

554
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,575
ActuaIIy I am.

555
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,875
But when you are keeping things
even from your own department...

556
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,178
...why are you teIIing me?

557
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,946
I mean... this Don Sir?

558
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,716
What's he got to do with me?

559
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,588
Look at this first.

560
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,357
You'II understand everything.

561
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,391
Okay.

562
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,663
This is ME!

563
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,066
You're joking, aren't you?

564
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,472
No.

565
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,337
No! You're... not joking!

566
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,108
So then?

567
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,251
In that case I'm feeIing...

568
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:36,390
...that you want me to
take Don's pIace...?

569
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:40,427
Yes.

570
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,065
Don't mind pIease.

571
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:43,055
Okay.

572
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:44,625
You just toId me...

573
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,633
...Don Sir kiIIed one
of your informers.

574
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:52,840
To say yes to this job
after hearing aII this...

575
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:56,371
...you get what I'm saying?

576
00:51:58,715 --> 00:51:59,773
DCP Saheb

577
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,743
Look at Don Sir! He uses his
gun without thinking twice...

578
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,310
...and me?

579
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,214
Forget a gun!

580
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,586
I can't even use a bicyde!

581
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,224
Vijay, I agree this job
is dangerous.

582
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:13,356
You don't say?

583
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,694
But if we pIan
each move carefuIIy...

584
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,266
...it can be easiIy done.

585
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,335
Sure... sure...

586
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:26,599
Sir, I'm not afraid of jumping
into this weII, but...

587
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,835
...you teII me...

588
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,113
If something happens to me?

589
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,742
Where wiII Deepu go?

590
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,116
I understand Vijay.

591
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,559
You must understand.

592
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,765
The peopIe I want to catch
with your heIp...

593
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:56,438
...find it easiest to get kids,
Iike Deepu, hooked onto drugs.

594
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,467
God forbid, if tomorrow...

595
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:03,375
...he gets addicted to this poison...

596
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,076
how wiII you forgive yourseIf?

597
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,890
Look Vijay. If you agree...

598
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,754
I'II take fuII responsibiIity for
this boy's education.

599
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,499
It wiII give Deepu the choice
to be whatever he wants...

600
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:30,066
...a doctor, an engineer...or
a poIice officer Iike me.

601
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:36,272
AII this is possibIe
if you want it.

602
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,145
Okay, DCP Saheb

603
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:49,054
But teII me something...

604
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,892
If Don Sir's gang find me out
and you find me in a coffin....

605
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:58,190
Deepu's name won't be cut from
the schooI register, wiII it?

606
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,531
Deepu education wiII be
Iooked after.

607
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:01,866
I promise.

608
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:03,898
OK... ok...

609
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,238
One more question...

610
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,879
The fact I am Vijay...

611
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,507
...not Don Sir.

612
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,917
... you aIone wiII
know that, right?

613
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:21,581
May God give you a Iong Iife
but what if you pop it...

614
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,257
I mean...

615
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:27,486
Don't worry.
Nothing wiII happen to me.

616
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:20,780
Stop.. Papa.

617
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,517
Where's Mummy?

618
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:25,919
Making breakfast.

619
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,083
And she sent you as her
aIarm dock, did she?

620
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,248
WeII, where's the button to
switch this aIarm off?

621
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:31,719
No....

622
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:44,102
Thank you Sir.

623
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:45,972
So... what's the probIem?

624
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,901
Just a moment, Sir...

625
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,875
Sir, is this the password
you entered?

626
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:55,846
That's the one.

627
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,080
F09AK7 4

628
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,581
If you remember, whiIe instaIIing
the program I had toId you...

629
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:07,788
... the password recorded in this foIder wiII be
shown backwards for safety reasons...

630
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:09,365
So your actuaI password is...

631
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,461
47KA90F

632
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,659
Oh God! yes.. I'm sorry.

633
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:15,471
WiII that be aII, Sir?

634
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:17,573
Stop! right here.

635
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:41,890
Is anybody there?!

636
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,138
HeIIo Jasjit.
I hope you are comfortabIe.

637
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:52,538
Who is this?

638
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,137
The man who can rescue you.

639
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,178
But you wiII have to
do me a smaII favor!

640
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,716
This is a strange way of asking
someone for a favor!

641
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,680
I Iike you, Jasjit.

642
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,375
TeII me something...

643
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:08,724
Isn't it true that Joshi's computer aIone,
can unIock his safe?

644
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:10,888
I don't know.

645
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,088
Oh reaIIy!

646
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,162
That means you were Iying to Joshi...

647
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,489
...or are you Iying to ME!

648
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,223
Look...

649
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,460
Think what you want.

650
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,633
But, just get me out of here.

651
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,238
Why?

652
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,333
Is it very suffocating?

653
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:33,476
If you want, we can send your
wife Geeta to be with you.

654
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,350
Take it easy Jasjit. ReIax!

655
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,357
AII you need to do is one job.

656
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,456
There are diamonds worth
10 miIIion doIIars in Joshi's safe.

657
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,296
Get them and I'II reIease her.

658
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,928
I want to taIk to Geeta.

659
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:57,573
Of course.

660
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:00,700
Jasjit...

661
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,435
Geeta...

662
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:05,711
I am so sorry... Geeta.

663
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,615
This is aII my fauIt.

664
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,551
Forgive me.

665
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,314
I Iove you.

666
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:16,926
I Iove you too.

667
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:20,021
That's very sweet but
I've got diabetes.

668
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,755
Now Iets taIk business.

669
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:24,596
The diamond company
Joshi works for...

670
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,799
...is on the 25th fIoor
of BeIcourt Towers.

671
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:34,338
The security on the entire fIoor is the kind
required to safeguard diamonds worth 10 miIIion.

672
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:39,037
We can get you to the roof
via the service Iift.

673
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,280
Rest... is up to you.

674
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,150
HoId it.

675
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,386
Right there!

676
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,953
Take the bag off your shouIder
and put it down.

677
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:40,361
You must be wondering how
the poIice got here.

678
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:42,703
I'II teII you.

679
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,604
Mrs. Wadia Iives in the
buiIding across the road.

680
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:49,440
She and her husband
quarreI pretty often...

681
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:54,214
...and the poor Iady comes out
to her baIcony to caIm down.

682
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,785
Guess what she saw
from her baIcony tonight?

683
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:04,886
Inspector De SiIva, pIease Iisten
to me very carefuIIy.

684
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,987
I'm being forced to do this.

685
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,322
Some peopIe have
kidnapped my wife.

686
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,858
You think I am a fooI...?

687
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:15,831
What's your name?

688
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:18,468
Jasjit.

689
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,875
You're under arrest.

690
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:23,304
Shinde...

691
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,133
Jasjit.... Stop.

692
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:03,913
Inspector...

693
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,589
They wiII kiII my wife!
I must go. Do you understand?

694
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,589
I'm teIIing the truth!

695
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:12,325
May be...

696
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:16,690
But I am not authorized
to sympathize with you.

697
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,027
Take him away.

698
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:36,785
Any idea where Deepu is?

699
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:55,971
De SiIva..

700
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:01,200
Your days are numbered!

701
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:18,093
Wow! Isn't this something?!
He's handsome!

702
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:23,589
You know, sir... seeing a picture is one thing.
To be face to face Iike this...

703
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,464
...Don Sir is aIive, isn't he?

704
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:28,798
Yes.

705
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,107
The doctors have kept him in
a sedated state.

706
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,944
I personaIIy beIieve that a person
Iike Don has no right to Iive.

707
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,513
But I need him now.

708
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,915
Vijay, I want you to study
him properIy...

709
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,448
...understand him...

710
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,618
Learn his habits,
his mannerisms,everything!

711
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,018
I wiII Iearn everything.
What's the big deaI?!

712
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:53,354
Let him wake up at Ieast!

713
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:58,968
As soon as your work is done,
I'II hand him over to the poIice.

714
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,094
I get it.

715
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,136
First...

716
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:06,735
AII the marks and scars that
were on Don's body...

717
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:08,678
...need to be made on you.

718
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,406
Sure.

719
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,278
On me...!!

720
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:13,443
Yes.

721
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,954
The doctors here can
do it painIessIy.

722
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,784
How can it be painIess?!

723
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,262
Hi.. Ashok.

724
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:34,365
He's aII yours.

725
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:36,738
Vijay, this is Dr. Ashok KhiIwani.

726
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,571
He wiII operate on you.

727
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:42,244
Everything ready as pIan?

728
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,738
Yes, just a few
preIiminary tests and...

729
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:46,378
...we are ready to get started.

730
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,412
I'II check everything.

731
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:49,580
Thanks Ashok.

732
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,054
What's the matter?

733
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:03,622
I've never heard that a buIIet mark on a shouIder
or a scar on the head can be made painIessIy.

734
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,728
Don't be afraid.
- How can I not be!!

735
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:08,600
I was about to teII you...

736
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:12,834
I got Deepu admitted to
MaIaysia's InternationaI SchooI.

737
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:14,903
Inter.... Int...

738
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,542
With that name, it must be good.

739
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,111
It's one of the best.
- Best.

740
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:22,010
Now you stop worrying about Deepu
and concentrate on your work.

741
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:22,908
Okay... okay...

742
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:29,118
Look, I'II teII you aII I know
about Don.

743
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,459
Besides that, I've thought of
another pIan.

744
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,923
When Don, that means you...

745
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:41,526
...go back to your companions,
you'II be iII and wounded.

746
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,273
You wiII have Iost your memory.

747
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:50,434
The more you Iearn about
Don's Iife...

748
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:54,246
...the doser I'II get to
regaining my memory.

749
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:55,311
Thank you.

750
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,787
You think exactIy Iike the
comicbook hero, Chacha Chaudhary!

751
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:00,744
You Know Chacha?

752
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:05,292
Brain working faster
than the computer.

753
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:07,656
I'II teII you a
great story. Listen...

754
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,793
One day, Chacha Chaudhary took
his dog Rocket out for stroII...

755
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:12,631
You want it?

756
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,660
Don never ate paan (betel leaf).
- Never ate paan!!

757
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,807
That wasn't very
nice of him, was it!

758
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:25,303
WeII, I guess that
I must quit too.

759
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,174
Fine.

760
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:30,783
Come on Vijay.

761
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,287
Is this a binocuIar?

762
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:38,183
Neha...

763
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:39,159
Yes Doctor...

764
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,129
Start monitoring the bIood
pressure of the patient.

765
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,454
Why?
- Yes Sir.

766
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:43,398
Anand...

767
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:45,028
Patch me through the face map.

768
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,331
Doctor...sir...

769
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:48,827
It won't be too painfuI, wiII it?

770
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,337
No, it...

771
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:01,846
How Iong, before he comes?

772
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,611
WeII.... Just another 48 hours, Mr. DesiIva
and then he is aII yours.

773
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,523
Good job Ashok.

774
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:11,291
Doctor, pIease come
immediateIy to room no. 2

775
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:12,483
Its an emergency.

776
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:13,920
My God!

777
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:14,921
What happened Ashok?

778
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:16,027
Don is admitted in that room.

779
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:17,465
What happened?

780
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,056
Heart seizure, doctor.

781
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,799
Have you given the patient
anything to stabiIize him?

782
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,163
Yes Doctor.. 2 mI of adrenaIine

783
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:23,938
Get me a cardiacinjection, Quick.

784
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:26,566
What's the bIood pressure?
- 210 by 120 doctor.

785
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,135
I said hurry up.

786
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,172
No...

787
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:34,344
God damn it...

788
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:45,991
Ashok...

789
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:51,431
You and your team know
nothing about this inddent.

790
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,135
This operation never happened.

791
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:55,869
Is that understood?

792
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:57,767
OK.

793
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,942
The success of my pIan is Iinked to
this secret remaining a secret.

794
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:05,141
Ashok...

795
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:07,875
It's onIy a matter of a few days.

796
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:52,350
HeIIo...

797
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:55,189
Yes...

798
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,196
Where have you seen him?

799
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,296
Where did you see him?
- Over there

800
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,840
The doctors are saying that
he has Iost his memory.

801
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:17,284
He doesn't remember anything.

802
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,952
StiII, we must get him back
at any cost.

803
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,852
You're right... but how?

804
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:28,357
The passport they found in his
car was MaIaysian...

805
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,126
... and they must send Don back.

806
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,596
Don't worry, Mr. Singhania.

807
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:37,037
It wiII be done.

808
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:25,978
Go back!

809
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:15,192
WeIcome back, Don.

810
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:21,127
That's right.

811
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,167
Your name is Don.

812
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,131
I am Narang.

813
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:28,231
She is Roma.

814
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:33,042
AII of us here, work with you...
and you work for Mr. Singhania.

815
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:36,116
You remember Mr. Singhania
at Ieast?

816
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:10,218
I don't beIieve it!

817
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:14,448
In spite of aII the security,
they took Don away!

818
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,292
Don's testimony couId have exposed
the entire crime ring.

819
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:28,667
But what can he teII us when he
doesn't remember anything?

820
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:32,500
I don't think he's of any use
to them now either.

821
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:33,764
Who is them?

822
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:41,015
Mr. MaIik, whoever did this either
works for Singhania or for his enemy.

823
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:42,174
Like who?

824
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:43,177
Like...

825
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,076
...Vardhaan.

826
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:48,790
Vardhaan...

827
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,816
Where is Vardhaan?!!

828
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,027
Have you seen him?

829
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,062
Do you know where he's hiding?

830
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,965
Do we even have a singIe
picture of him?

831
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,362
No.

832
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:02,170
PIease....

833
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:06,641
And by the way Mr. De SiIva.

834
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:10,834
Memory isn't something that
once Iost, can't be found.

835
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:13,510
It's just a matter of time.

836
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:19,788
Is this...

837
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:21,785
... mine?

838
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:23,490
Yes...

839
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:28,663
For me, Don isn't Don...

840
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:31,299
...without this.

841
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:46,010
How do I Iook?

842
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:49,278
You Iook very dangerous.

843
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,515
Mr. MaIik...

844
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,525
It's been 3 weeks since
Don's escape.

845
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,027
Why can't the poIice catch him?

846
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,155
You teII us where he is and
we'II go catch him!

847
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,162
PIease... Mr. MaIik

848
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:09,996
- Look, untiI we get the right information,
or a witness comes forward...

849
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,430
...We must foIIow poIice procedure.

850
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:24,282
What's in it?

851
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:32,055
Our contacts, bank account numbers
and passwords are aII recorded in this.

852
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:36,660
You had made it yourseIf
and put it in the safe.

853
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:40,327
Yes.

854
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:49,973
Yes, Vijay. TeII me.

855
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:51,303
De SiIva Saheb...

856
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,274
I know enough about Don...

857
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,675
...my memory can return now.

858
01:15:59,021 --> 01:15:59,953
Good.

859
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,653
We must do this with
utmost care.

860
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,256
I agree.

861
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:08,690
If you can't Iose your
memory without reason...

862
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:12,931
...then it shouIdn't come back
without reason either.

863
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,700
I've got a soIution for that.

864
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,667
Tomorrow, make some excuse...

865
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:20,174
...and come to the pIace I've fixed.

866
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,219
Who are you waiting for?

867
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,089
Maybe... you.

868
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:48,461
Oh that...

869
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,668
You have done a Iot for me...

870
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:55,674
I won't forget that.

871
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:59,210
There's a Iot more Ieft to do.

872
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:04,476
That there is .

873
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:03,405
Don...!

874
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,321
It was Iike this the
other day too.

875
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,420
I was in my car...

876
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:22,693
...and the poIice
were chasing me.

877
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,890
They were shooting at me...

878
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:27,528
And then I...

879
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:32,868
I remember everything.

880
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:34,403
Who I am!

881
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,507
Who aII of you are!

882
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,468
I remember each
and everything!

883
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:39,338
Mac...

884
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:44,047
Remembering your friend's
names is one thing....

885
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:50,684
...in our business, it's important to
remember our enemy's name.

886
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,152
Which enemy are you
taIking of,Narang?

887
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:57,229
Vardhaan or that officer DesiIva?

888
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,059
Maybe T.J is the one you
were thinking about...

889
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:07,534
..or the man who betrayed
us aII... Ramesh?

890
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,176
I reaIIy enjoyed kiIIing them aII.

891
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:21,979
This caIIs for a ceIebration.
- Oh yes, it does.

892
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,923
I am... back.

893
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,561
The people in this world...

894
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:12,632
have clutched their hearts again!

895
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,735
l have returned...

896
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:16,634
... bringing back with me

897
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:20,470
a lot of excitement!

898
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:32,215
Look who's here.

899
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:36,320
Back to rule your world.

900
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:40,324
Who's got you mesmerized?

901
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,203
For whom do you wait
with open arms?

902
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:49,872
Who is this charming man?

903
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:55,775
Recognize me.

904
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:58,843
l am Don.

905
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:22,665
l bid my life...

906
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:26,636
...and gamble with death.

907
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:28,706
l have no regret...

908
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:30,650
...nor do l care....

909
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:34,345
...who l make my enemy.

910
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,284
No enemy of mine,

911
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:46,394
will live too long.

912
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:50,032
l am very dangerous.

913
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:59,942
l am very dangerous...

914
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,809
...and forever cunning.

915
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:09,183
Who isback to win
the world over?

916
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,290
Recognize me.

917
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:19,826
l am Don.

918
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:04,711
Their eyes inviting...

919
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:10,549
...many women have
wanted me for themselves.

920
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,676
But these two eyes

921
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:14,815
that are glancing into mine...

922
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,052
...have mesmerized me.

923
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,357
These eyes...

924
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,897
...tell me...

925
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:29,802
that they are hiding
an intoxicating secret.

926
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:33,240
l am getting addicted to them...

927
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:43,613
l am getting addicted to them...

928
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,688
and my heart is falling
under it's spell

929
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:53,726
Who ishere that has
fallen under this spell?

930
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:59,624
Recognize me.

931
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:03,830
l am Don.

932
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,728
Yes, Vijay?

933
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:36,401
AdeaI is on at 7 tomorrow morning,
outside the city.

934
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:39,262
If you couId come there...

935
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:43,307
...I'II bring the discwith me.

936
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:46,275
I'm sure...

937
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:50,848
...it has aII the information
the poIice wants.

938
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:52,648
Can you come there aIone?

939
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:54,581
Rest assured.

940
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:57,314
There'II be no one with me.

941
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:49,308
Mr. Narang, don't you think it's
unsafe for Don to go aIone?

942
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,276
I mean, this deaI couId
aIso be a setup.

943
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:55,774
Don won't go aIone.

944
01:25:58,319 --> 01:25:59,343
You wiII go with him.

945
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,085
Don't be siIIy Narang...

946
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:05,317
Are you teIIing me that
I can't do this job aIone?

947
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,660
No. I know that you can
do it aIone.

948
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:13,830
But Mr. Singhania has personaIIy
ordered me to do this.

949
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:15,298
Mr. Narang...

950
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,203
Can't Vikram or Macdo this job?

951
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:20,704
Why is it important for Roma
to go with Don?

952
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:23,708
Because Mr. Narang knows
me very weII...

953
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:28,842
... and when, where and
who to shoot...

954
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:31,215
...is something
I know very weII.

955
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:10,851
Singhania...

956
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,952
Your time is up.

957
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:19,295
Tomorrow, the discwiII be mine
and you'II be finished!

958
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:23,498
Tomorrow... !

959
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:28,574
This one word separates me
from my success.

960
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:37,411
And don't worry.

961
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:41,484
The poIice wiII never find out
that I have the disc.

962
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:45,155
Because neither do they know
that I am Vardhaan.

963
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:51,696
Nor is my photograph in
any of their records.

964
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,200
Is this a joke?!

965
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,200
No, its not!

966
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:05,300
What is this madness?

967
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,000
I have feIt this mad since...

968
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:11,100
you kiIIed my brother Ramesh
and his fiance.

969
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,000
Ramesh! Your brother?

970
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,400
Yes...

971
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,900
And I didn't kiII you
tiII now because...

972
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:22,100
I wanted you to remember
why you were being kiIIed!

973
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,500
You don't know this but...

974
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,500
I didn't kiII your brother.

975
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,300
Good bye Don.

976
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,000
Stop!That's enough...

977
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,500
Look! Look at me.

978
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,600
Listen carefuIIy.

979
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,600
You didn't kiII me
aII these days...

980
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,100
... and for that, I thank you.

981
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,000
Now Iisten to the truth.

982
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,600
The truth is...

983
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,300
The truth is...

984
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,000
He...

985
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:43,800
...is not Don.

986
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,200
Who can say that
he is not Don!

987
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,900
Besides Vijay and me now...

988
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,400
...onIy you know the truth.

989
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,900
Where is the disc?

990
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,000
Vijay...

991
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,100
I'm sorry.

992
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:24,600
I thought that...

993
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,100
No, it doesn't matter.

994
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,400
Anyone in your pIace...

995
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,400
... wouId have been deceived.

996
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Mr. DesiIva...

997
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:37,800
Your work is done?

998
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:38,300
No...

999
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,200
My work isn't done yet.

1000
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,200
That too wiII happen.

1001
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:46,700
Singhania is coming here.

1002
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:49,500
Singhania?

1003
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:50,900
Yes, sir.

1004
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,000
He is coming to KuaIa Lumpur
for a meeting.

1005
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:56,900
I'II inform you of the Iocation
as soon as I know.

1006
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,300
Good.

1007
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:02,300
Vijay...

1008
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,900
You may have done this
for Deepu's sake but...

1009
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,300
... neither me nor the poIice
wiII ever forget this favor.

1010
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:14,200
... neither me nor the poIice
wiII ever forget this favor.

1011
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,300
Who is Deepu?

1012
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:29,900
Vijay unde...!

1013
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Don't you recognize me?

1014
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,300
How can I not recognize you?

1015
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,000
My... Deepu!

1016
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,200
But, honestIy...

1017
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,200
... for one second
I did wonder,

1018
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,100
''who is this smart young gentIeman
running towards me?''

1019
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,300
This new uniform!

1020
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:55,700
New shoes.

1021
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,700
WeII unde, you aren't the
same either!

1022
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,000
What can I say, Deepu?

1023
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,100
Your Vijay unde...

1024
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:05,900
...had to change.

1025
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,000
But what about your paan?

1026
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,300
Paan is gone!

1027
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:10,600
Just a minute...

1028
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:12,400
Roma, this is Deepu.

1029
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:13,800
Hi Deepu.

1030
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,300
Nice to meet you.

1031
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:16,800
HeIIo... me too...

1032
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,300
And Deepu, this is Roma aunty.

1033
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,400
Unde, is she your auntytoo?
- Hey! Is that anyway to speak!

1034
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:29,000
Unde, is she your auntytoo?
- Hey! Is that anyway to speak!

1035
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:29,800
Vijay...

1036
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:33,400
The things you are doing
for this boy....!

1037
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,900
Who does this in today's time?

1038
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,100
If anything wouId have
happened to you today...

1039
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,300
...I wouId never forgive myseIf!

1040
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:47,200
PIease forget aII about it.

1041
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:50,900
Anyway...

1042
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:52,600
I don't know...

1043
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,700
... ShouId I be gratefuI to Don for
making it possibIe to meet you..

1044
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,600
or I shouId hate him.

1045
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:03,400
Because I wonder...

1046
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,200
...how you can even
sit beside a man...

1047
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,100
who constantIy reminds you
of your brother's death.

1048
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:18,200
I can't punish you for a crime
committed by someone eIse.

1049
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:23,500
And pIease.

1050
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,000
Stop addressing me so formaIIy.

1051
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,400
What do I caII you then?

1052
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Aunty?

1053
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:54,300
Excuse me...

1054
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:56,300
HeIIo...

1055
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,400
There is some Mr. Jasjit Ahuja
here to see you sir.

1056
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,400
Jasjit...

1057
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,400
Jasjit...

1058
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,100
How are you, Haatim?
- Very weII.

1059
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:13,500
What a surprise?

1060
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,400
My God, it's been ages
since we met!

1061
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:16,700
BangaIore 2002.

1062
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:18,900
Before you came here.

1063
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:20,500
ReaIIy!..

1064
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,400
How time fIies!

1065
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,200
UnbeIievabIe!...

1066
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:26,000
What brings you here?

1067
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,600
DCP DesiIva is in this
city right now.

1068
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Yes...

1069
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,300
I heard about what
happened to you...

1070
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,300
...I'm sorry.

1071
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:42,900
I couIdn't do
anything for you.

1072
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:44,800
But you can now.

1073
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,200
I want his address, Haatim.

1074
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,400
What do you pIan on doing?

1075
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,000
What time is the meeting?

1076
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,500
And Singhania wiII be there?

1077
01:35:59,000 --> 01:35:59,800
Good... I'II see you then.

1078
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:00,800
Vijay...

1079
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,000
WeII done!

1080
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,300
WeIcome back!...

1081
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,900
Perhaps you don't know
who I am?

1082
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,100
I know you very weII.

1083
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:06,200
DCP DesiIva.

1084
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:10,000
Who are you?

1085
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,000
Think back!

1086
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,400
9th January, BeIcourt Towers?

1087
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,600
10 miIIion doIIars worth
of diamonds?

1088
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:19,300
No!

1089
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:23,400
WeII, maybe a buIIet couId heIp
sharpen your memory.

1090
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:24,400
Hang on!...

1091
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,700
Jasjit?

1092
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,200
Yes...

1093
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,100
Jasjit.

1094
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,400
What do you want?

1095
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,000
I want to kiII you!

1096
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:43,000
I hope you won't
mind too much!

1097
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,500
Look, Jasjit...

1098
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Maybe what happened
to you was wrong...

1099
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:50,200
I was onIy doing my duty.

1100
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:52,500
I'm a poIice officer...

1101
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:56,000
... and right now it's crudaI
for me to be somewhere.

1102
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,500
Or eIse some big criminaIs
wiII get away.

1103
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:01,800
Let me go!

1104
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:04,500
How can I Iet you go?

1105
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,700
Look at these faces!

1106
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,000
One of them is my wife...

1107
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,800
who is dead because of you.

1108
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,700
The other is my innocent son!

1109
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,500
Who knows where he is now?

1110
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:20,100
Look at them...

1111
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:26,100
This boy...

1112
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:28,900
Deepu...

1113
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,600
Is your son?!

1114
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,200
You know Deepu?

1115
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,100
Yes. I aIso know
where he is...

1116
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:43,500
...but wiII teII you that,
onIy after I come back.

1117
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:47,700
Wrong!

1118
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,900
You wiII teII me right now!

1119
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,400
Jasjit...

1120
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,700
You can kiII me and
take your revenge...

1121
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:00,100
... but then give up the hope that
you'II see your son again!

1122
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,700
I don't hate you as much...

1123
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,500
as I Iove my son.

1124
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,000
Go.

1125
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,400
I wiII wait for you here.

1126
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:27,600
Leave that here.

1127
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,400
You do have to come back,
don't you?

1128
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,500
Night and wine have met
we are intoxicated

1129
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:48,800
Night and wine have met
we are intoxicated

1130
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,000
Body and heart
are both ready to melt

1131
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,900
Body and heart
are both ready to melt

1132
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:56,400
Celebration surrounds us

1133
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:02,800
Celebration surrounds us

1134
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:03,900
but yet l am anxious

1135
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:09,300
but yet l am anxious

1136
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:11,800
Why does my heart beat faster?

1137
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,500
Why does my heart say...

1138
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:17,900
... ''you fools do not know this yet?''

1139
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:22,500
... ''you fools do not know this yet?''

1140
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,800
Tonight...

1141
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:27,700
Who knows what will happen?

1142
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:32,500
What will we gain?

1143
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,500
What will we lose?

1144
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,900
Tonight...

1145
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,800
Who knows what will happen?

1146
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:46,500
What will we gain?

1147
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,500
What will we lose?

1148
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,500
What will happen
in just a few moments?

1149
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:16,300
What will happen
in just a few moments?

1150
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:17,500
What was always mine
will be mine again.

1151
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:23,300
What was always mine
will be mine again.

1152
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:24,500
The night will decide
who resides in who'sheart

1153
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:29,700
The night will decide
who resides in who'sheart

1154
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:32,200
The decision has been made...

1155
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,900
...that l will be victorious

1156
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,300
You fools do not know this yet

1157
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:43,200
You fools do not know this yet

1158
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,400
Tonight...

1159
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:49,200
Who knows what will happen?

1160
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,100
What will we gain?

1161
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,100
What will we lose?

1162
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:59,600
Tonight...

1163
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,200
Who knows what will happen?

1164
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:07,200
What will we gain?

1165
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:10,200
What will we lose?

1166
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:58,600
Come, let me tell you
something,secretly

1167
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:05,100
Come, let me tell you
something,secretly

1168
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:07,000
Soon, the night is going to
change itshue, secretly

1169
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:12,200
Soon, the night is going to
change itshue, secretly

1170
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:13,000
Then l will take you away

1171
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:18,400
Then l will take you away

1172
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,200
Where will you go?

01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:24,700
Look! Here l am.

1174
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:27,000
You fools do not know this yet

1175
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,900
You fools do not know this yet

1176
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:34,100

What will we lose?

1180
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:27,300
Move it...!

1181
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,500
Put your gun down.

1182
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:39,300
Open the door.

1183
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:42,900
Let him go.

1184
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:44,300
Shoot, Mr. MaIik!

1185
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,800
Mr. MaIik! Shoot him!
- Shut up.

1186
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:48,000
Let him go. Put your gun down.

1187
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:48,900
Shoot, Mr. MaIik!

1188
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,200
Get into the van. Move!

1189
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:51,800
MaIik! Shoot him.

1190
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:55,500
Do you want me to shoot him?

1191
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:56,200
ReIax...

1192
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:58,300
MaIik...

1193
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,000
CIose the door.

1194
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Shut the door.

1195
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:05,700
Stop!

1196
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:08,400
Turn the engine off!

1197
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:09,600
Now..!

1198
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:13,100
I mean it.

1199
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:14,600
Now!

1200
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:12,100
Yes...

1201
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:13,500
OK... Thank you.

1202
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:19,900
What do you think, Verma?

1203
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,100
Is this man teIIing the truth
that he is not Don?

1204
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:27,900
Don is very dever, sir.

1205
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:31,800
CIaiming that he is Vijay,
Mr. DesiIva's informer...

1206
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:34,700
...is sureIy a pIan to
escape punishment.

1207
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,000
Hmm? Lets do this...

1208
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:44,300
Bring Narang and Machere.

1209
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:47,100
Let them hear
what he's saying.

1210
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,300
Perhaps his words...

1211
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,900
...can break them.

1212
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,400
Mr. MaIik, how many times do
I have to teII you I'm not Don!

1213
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:57,600
I'm Vijay...
DesiIva saheb's informer.

1214
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:01,200
If Singhania's men are behind bars
today, it's aII due to me.

1215
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:04,200
And why don't you go ask
DesiIva saheb who I am?

1216
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,900
DCP DesiIva is no
Ionger with us.

1217
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:08,400
He's dead.

1218
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:09,400
Dead?

1219
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:17,900
Just a minute!

1220
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:19,700
Then...

1221
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,900
Where's the disc I gave him?

1222
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:23,200
What disc?

1223
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:28,100
I had given him a discthat contained information
of Singhania's contacts and bank accounts.

1224
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:32,400
I'm sorry but he didn't mention
any such disc.

1225
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,900
But it must be somewhere!

1226
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:36,500
...in his apartment or
somewhere here...

1227
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:39,100
in his desk... or...

1228
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:40,600
Mr. MaIik!

1229
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:42,900
If I were Don...

1230
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,800
...how wouId I know that
he had this disc?

1231
01:50:58,200 --> 01:50:58,700
DCP DesiIva's informer has
toId us quite a Iot about you.

1232
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:04,100
DCP DesiIva's informer has
toId us quite a Iot about you.

1233
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:07,300
Now if there is anything,
you two wouId Iike to say?

1234
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,400
What are you saying, Mr. MaIik?

1235
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:11,300
This man is Don.

1236
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:14,600
And he is doing what
he know's best.

1237
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:15,900
What's that?

1238
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:19,500
Making poIice officers Iike you
Iook Iike fooIs.

1239
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:19,900
Shut up.

1240
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,100
Take them away.

1241
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:39,500
Verma, take a smaII team to
DCP DesiIva's apartment.

1242
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,900
If that discis there...

1243
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:43,300
...it's possibIe this man is
speaking the truth.

1244
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,600
He is teIIing the truth.

1245
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:47,700
He is not Don.

1246
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:11,600
MaIik Saheb, I'm teIIing the truth...

1247
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,700
I gave De SiIva saheb the
discwith my own hands!

1248
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,900
You don't beIieve me,
do you?

1249
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:25,300
Don, I gave you a chance...

1250
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:28,600
But now even you can't deny
the fact that you are Don.

1251
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:29,600
I'm sorry.

1252
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:31,500
Verma.. just send
the guards in!

1253
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:32,200
Wait...!

1254
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:33,800
There is another proof...

1255
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:37,500
Dr. Ashok KhiIwani!

1256
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:40,700
He operated on me to
make me Iook Iike Don.

1257
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:42,100
PIease...! He knows the truth.

1258
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:43,800
PIease.. Sir...

1259
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:51,300
Thank you, Feroze.

1260
01:52:59,400 --> 01:52:59,900
MaIik Saheb...

1261
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,000
...did you taIk to
the doctor?

1262
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:04,200
He is not aIive.
- Not aIive?!

1263
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:07,900
Last month, he and his assistant
died in a car accident.

1264
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:08,900
MaIik Saheb...

1265
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:10,400
PIease beIieve me.
I'm not Don!

1266
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,600
The Court wiII decide
this matter.

1267
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:13,700
PIease Iisten to me!

1268
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:16,500
I'm Vijay, MaIik saheb!

1269
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:17,700
I'm not Don, I'm Vijay!

1270
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:20,500
Try and understand...

1271
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:29,700
HeIIo Vijay!

1272
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:34,400
We heard everything.

1273
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:37,900
Don't be siIIy, Mac.

1274
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:40,200
I am Don.

1275
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,400
I onIy said that to
confuse them.

1276
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,300
What's happening?

1277
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:51,700
Stop it.

1278
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:52,700
Narang...!

1279
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:55,100
PIease make them understand.
- Shut up.

1280
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:57,200
You are Vijay...

1281
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,800
But if they attack
you here...

1282
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,500
...the poIice wiII reaIize...

1283
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:05,600
...are not Don.

1284
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:07,400
Get back.

1285
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,800
Get back...!

1286
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:17,000
So...

1287
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:20,100
Behaving a bit too smart,
weren't you, boy?!

1288
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:24,000
Now get ready to die.

1289
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,500
The punishment for seIIing
drugs in MaIaysia...

1290
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:30,200
...is death...

1291
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:33,900
... and the court wiII sureIy give
Don the death sentence.

1292
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:38,600
If it doesn't...

1293
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:40,700
... we'II kiII Vijay in jaiI.

1294
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:59,300
... we'II kiII Vijay in jaiI.

1295
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:00,100
What happened, sir?

1296
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:03,500
They say that, tiII we
get a date in court...

1297
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:09,300
...it's not safe to keep these
dangerous criminaIs here.

1298
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:10,400
So what is their intention?

1299
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:11,500
They have a high security jaiI on
an isIand, five miIes off the coast.

1300
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:17,300
They have a high security jaiI on
an isIand, five miIes off the coast.

1301
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,500
They'II aII be fIown there
first thing tomorrow.

1302
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:17,400
Excuse me...

1303
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,800
I need to use the
toiIet pIease...!

1304
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:23,600
Very badIy...!

1305
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,100
Hey...

1306
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:33,900
Okay.

1307
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:39,900
Come through!

1308
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:44,700
Hey... hey...
- Easy!

1309
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:46,200
Okay... okay...

1310
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,100
Sorry.

1311
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:00,300
Come through.

1312
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:03,400
Hi...

01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:09,300
Give me your gun, PIease!

1314
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:12,300
Just stay there.

1315
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:13,900
Come on...!

1316
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:16,400
Now the handcuffs...

1317
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:17,400
Go on...!

1318
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:20,200
Quick!

1319
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:24,400
The other one...!

1320
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:25,400
Quick...

1321
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:34,800
Now give me his
gun, PIease...

1322
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:36,600
Quick... quick...!

1323
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:44,500
Take him with the others.

1324
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:44,900
Move it!

1325
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:50,200
Fast...!

1326
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:51,600
Go on...!

1327
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:13,100
No..!

1328
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,000
CongratuIations! Jasjit.

1329
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:03,700
The information on this disc...

1330
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,700
...is Iike a winning Iottery ticket.

1331
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:10,800
I know a man who can get you
a Iot of money for this disc.

1332
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:27,900
I know a man who can get you
a Iot of money for this disc.

1333
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:28,900
Jasjit...

1334
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:35,500
DesiIva said that he knew
where Deepu was.

1335
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:37,800
Perhaps, the buyer we find
may have known DesiIva?

1336
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:44,500
Perhaps, the buyer we find
may have known DesiIva?

1337
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:45,100
Haatim...

1338
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:56,000
If he can Iead me to Deepu,
I'II Iet him have aII that money.

1339
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:56,700
I see...

1340
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:00,000
And you have this disc.

1341
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:02,900
No probIem.

1342
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:04,500
It'II be done.

1343
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:09,900
MaIik...

1344
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:14,900
What!

1345
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:24,200
What happened, sir?
Who was that?

1346
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,400
An incident on board forced the
piIot to make an emergency Ianding.

1347
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,100
Don has escaped!

1348
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:08,200
Thanks...

1349
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:11,900
Thanks for coming!

1350
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,600
Thank God you're
aII right!

1351
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:16,300
You caII this being aII right?

1352
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:18,300
Vijay...

1353
02:03:19,700 --> 02:03:20,800
I know what the truth is.

1354
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:23,600
The truth...?

1355
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:28,600
Why wiII the poIice
beIieve you, Roma?

1356
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:37,200
OnIy the disccan prove
my innocence now.

1357
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,400
We''II get the disc.

1358
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:44,500
The man who stoIe the disc...

1359
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:48,800
... cannot be honest enough
to return it to the poIice.

1360
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:52,300
He's sure to try
and seII it.

1361
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:56,300
Just a minute, Roma.

1362
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,100
Singhania has an agent here...

1363
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:03,300
...who kept him informed about
the cops and our enemies.

1364
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:06,900
He couId be of use.

1365
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Try and contact him somehow.

1366
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,000
But if you are found meanwhiIe...

1367
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:20,000
I mean, the poIice wiII be
searching everywhere for you.

1368
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:21,900
I know!

1369
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,000
But where can I go?!

1370
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,500
There is one pIace.

1371
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:36,800
Where is Ramesh's pIace?

1372
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:38,000
CIose by. To the right.

1373
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:56,800
Stop pIease.

1374
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:05,300
Your's, sir?

1375
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:10,300
AII units respond...

1376
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:11,600
Wait...

1377
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:13,200
We have a fugitive situation.

1378
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:14,600
Suspect's name is Don.

1379
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:17,100
Last seen wearing a dark jacket,
trousers and a grey shirt

1380
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:18,600
He is of Indian origin.

1381
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:12,000
Who are you, saheb?
What do you want?

1382
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:15,400
How does one expIain
who he is?

1383
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:18,200
Just know that we are
in big troubIe...

1384
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:21,800
...and need sheIter for a whiIe,
that's aII.

1385
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:25,600
It's not a poIice affair, eh?

1386
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:30,600
ShouId we teII them?

1387
02:06:31,900 --> 02:06:32,800
Unde...

1388
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:36,100
It's a poIice affair and...

1389
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:37,900
...an affair of the heart too!

1390
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:41,500
WeII! I get it now.

1391
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:43,500
You've run away?

1392
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,300
No, unde. I haven't run away...

1393
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:49,300
I've been kidnapped!

1394
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:52,700
That's great!

1395
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:56,500
Where do we witness
Iove Iike this nowadays?!

1396
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:59,400
Come this way, saheb.
Come, madam

1397
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:02,800
Sit down, saheb.

1398
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:04,700
Unde...

1399
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:09,900
Saheb! Bhaang! (MiIk brewed
with Marijuana pIant extract)

1400
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:11,100
Bhaang?

1401
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:12,200
Tonight is Mahashivratri
(Indian festivaI in honor of Lord Shiva)

1402
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:15,400
...it is a hoIy offering
to Shiva. Drink!

1403
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:18,200
Oh, the Iord wiII bIess you for
drinking his favourite brew!

1404
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:20,200
You aIso try it.

1405
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:21,300
Cheers...

1406
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:31,200
Happy Mahashivratri everyone.

1407
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,100
It's aII right, brother!

1408
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:14,700
HonestIy speaking, unde...

1409
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:19,500
If I had Iistened to my mother
when I was a boy...

1410
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:22,400
I wouIdn't be seeing these days!

1411
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:27,300
Why? What did she say?

1412
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:28,900
When I never Iistened to her,
how can I teII you what she said!

1413
02:08:28,900 --> 02:08:36,100
When I never Iistened to her,
how can I teII you what she said!

1414
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:38,300
If you're done,
can we pIease Ieave?

1415
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:41,500
Leave! But where do we go?

1416
02:08:42,700 --> 02:08:43,700
De SiIva...

1417
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:47,400
DCP saheb!

1418
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:49,500
You set up a good way to get me
up there before you Ieft..!

1419
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:54,000
You set up a good way to get me

1420
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:54,600
WeII done!

1421
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,600
Saheb... paan!

1422
02:08:57,200 --> 02:08:59,900
Hey buddy!
I don't want it!

1423
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:03,600
Eat it. It's from Benaras.

1424
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:06,700
ReaIIy?

1425
02:09:07,900 --> 02:09:11,600
But Don didn't eat paan.

1426
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:13,500
Never...

1427
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,100
Don, who?

1428
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:18,900
Don.... Who??!

1429
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:24,600
Don means me, meaning Vijay
a.k.a Don, meaning...

1430
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:26,400
Paan!

1431
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:28,700
I didn't understand a thing.

1432
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:32,800
How do l tell you, brother?

1433
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:37,200
The plight l am in.

1434
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:39,400
Tell us... tell us...

1435
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,600
l set out to eat ''halwa''
(hot lndian dessert)...

1436
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:45,600
...and ended up burning my mouth!

1437
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,100
What can l say?

1438
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:55,900
How can l explain?

1439
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:57,700
l'm in a bad situation...

1440
02:09:58,200 --> 02:09:59,400
...that'shard to escape.

1441
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,100
lt's like a violent storm!

1442
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:02,700
lt's like a raging wind!

1443
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:04,600
l've had to...

1444
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:06,300
...run for my life!

1445
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:08,000
A long and winding...

1446
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:09,700
...chase has been on!

1447
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:12,000
Day and night,
l've been awake...

1448
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:14,400
...running helter skelter.

1449
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:16,400
Sometimes this way!

1450
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,500
Sometimes that way!

1451
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:20,500
Sometimes this way!
Sometimes that way!

1452
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:22,100
Ran this way once
and that way next!!

1453
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:23,600
Then you gave me this paan...

1454
02:10:24,300 --> 02:10:27,200
...and life has returned
to mytired body!

1455
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:39,200
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1456
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:42,400
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1457
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,800
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1458
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:49,400
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1459
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:52,500
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1460
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:56,300
Now watch the things l'll do...

1461
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:59,600
...to straighten up everyone

1462
02:11:00,100 --> 02:11:00,800
Thisboy...

1463
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:02,400
Thisboy...

1464
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:06,500
...this boy from the
banks of the Ganges!

1465
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:14,900
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1466
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,900
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1467
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:45,300
l've been cursed!

1468
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:48,300
...to be caught up in
this maze, alas!

1469
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:53,200
My life is in limbo...

1470
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:57,100
...l'm at the hangman's mercy, alas!

1471
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:01,200
So honest and simple,
So innocent... yes l am.

1472
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:08,200
So honest and simple,
So innocent... yes l am.

1473
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:11,900
Don't know how l ended up
amid this educated lot!!

1474
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:13,200
With a sweetened knife...

1475
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:16,700
With a sweetened knife
they've slit mythroat!

1476
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:19,900
This boy from the
banks of the Ganges!

1477
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:28,700
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1478
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:32,000
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1479
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:47,200
A lovely lass,
unique and desirable...

1480
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:51,600
...her enrapturing charm
turns all heads...

1481
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,500
...wherever she goes...

1482
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:57,900
and her body sparkles
like precious stones

1483
02:12:58,300 --> 02:12:59,700
Her dazzling eyes carry
a world of dreams...

1484
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:01,500
...her lips, youth'snectar

1485
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:04,100
A flirtatious swagger
in her walk...

1486
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:06,800
...sprinkles the air with her
sandalwood-scented body

1487
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:10,200
The vision of her
sets your heart aflame

1488
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:12,600
Her face ismoon-bright.

1489
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,500
Her eyes like a gazelle

1490
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:18,500
Her face ismoon-bright.

1491
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:20,200
Her eyes like a gazelle

1492
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:21,800
She is beautiful...

1493
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:23,700
...as sweet as honey

1494
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:30,100
A beautiful maiden...

1495
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:33,300
...hasfallen for me, alas!

1496
02:13:36,700 --> 02:13:38,800
A sweetened skewer...

1497
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:42,600
...haspierced my heart, alas!

1498
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:47,500
So bright and fair

1499
02:13:50,900 --> 02:13:54,100
So bright and fair
she's a spicy lass

1500
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:57,200
A fighting spirit to match
she stole my heart

1501
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:58,800
Now that l have her love...

1502
02:13:59,300 --> 02:14:02,300
Now that l have her love
my life has blossomed!

1503
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:05,500
This boy from the
banks of the Ganges!

1504
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:14,000
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1505
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:17,400
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1506
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:21,000
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1510
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:32,500
Thisboy...

1511
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:34,400
Thisboy...

1512
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:38,100

1513
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:54,500

There's a buyer for the dischere.

1516
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,600

...change my mind.

1533
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:31,000

1534
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:35,300

02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:17,600
Where's the disc?

1540
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:18,800

1544
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:33,000
Jasjit...

1545
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,900
Seeing your punctuaIity...

1546
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:38,600

DesiIva...?!

1549
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:46,700

Vardhaan.

1551
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Vardhaan...?

1552
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,700
But you...
- ...are dead?!!

1553
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:55,600
Right?

1554
02:17:57,100 --> 02:18:02,900
For a man who can keep the
poIice in the dark for years...

1555
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:04,100
...creating the drama of a mere
accident is no big deaI!

1556
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:10,800
...creating the drama of a mere
accident is no big deaI!

1557
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:11,800
Do you want me to shoot him?

1558
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:12,500
ReIax...

1559
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:14,700
MaIik...

1560
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Shut the door.

1561
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,400
Let's go.

1562
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:23,300
Stop!

1563
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:27,500
Turn the engine off.

1564
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:30,000
I mean it.

1565
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:31,500
Come on.

1566
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:51,300
You're very cunning.

1567
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:53,200

02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:56,000
Now aII I want is the disc...

02:18:56,900 --> 02:18:58,200
...which you wiII give me.

1570
02:18:59,400 --> 02:19:00,300
I don't beIieve it.

1571
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:03,700
Now I get it!

1572
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:08,300
Why the poIice didn't find
the diamonds in that basement.

1573
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:11,000
I recognize that ring.

1574
02:19:12,500 --> 02:19:13,400
What did you think?

1575
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:15,700
I brought the discwith me!

1576
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:19,300
Do you think I am a fooI?

1577
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:21,600
Remember?

1578
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:25,600
That night, you had asked me
the same question!

1579
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:28,800
You have a very good memory.

1580
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:32,700
It'II heIp in recognizing
your son.

1581
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:34,100
Daddy...

1582
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:39,700
Deepu...

1583
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:44,400
Vardhaan...

1584
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:45,600
If anything happens...

1585
02:19:45,900 --> 02:19:46,800
ReIaxJ.J!

1586
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:49,300

1587
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,700

Are you okay, son?

02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:15,500
Deepu...

1601
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,200
Listen carefuIIy.

1602
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:21,400
As Iong as they do not get

1603
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:23,100
...our Iife is not in danger.

Nobody is going to come.

1606
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:32,100
That phone caII was
to buy us time.

1607
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:35,200
I'm scared, daddy.

1608
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,300
Don't be, my son.

1609
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:41,200

02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:20,700
Nobody has come so far.

1614
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:24,800
Okay.

1615
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:37,500

Whatever I did for him...

1634
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:51,800
Deepu is a IovabIe boy.

1635
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,900
Anyway, why do you need
this discso badIy?

1636
02:27:56,900 --> 02:28:02,400
Just know that the onIy way
out of the mess I'm in...

1637
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:03,400
...is this disc...

1638
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,800
...and your testimony

1639
02:28:06,500 --> 02:28:07,200
I don't understand.

1640
02:28:08,700 --> 02:28:10,500
Your testimony wiII prove...

1641
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:14,400
...that this discwas
with DCP DesiIva.

1642
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:16,300
DCP DesiIva?!

1643
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:17,200
Yes.

1644
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:20,100
He was the onIy one in the
poIice department who knew...

1645
02:28:20,900 --> 02:28:22,500
..that he is not Don,
but Vijay.

1646
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,200
But after he died...

1647
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:25,100
He is not dead!

1648
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:29,900
His reaI name is Vardhaan.

1649
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:32,700
And just a IittIe whiIe ago...
I met him!

1650
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:33,000
No!

1651
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:37,600
This can't be.

1652
02:28:40,100 --> 02:28:41,300
I mean...

1653
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,300
your eyes must have
deceived you!!

1654
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:45,300
No, I have not been deceived.

1655
02:28:46,700 --> 02:28:48,400
DCP DesiIva is Vardhaan!!

1656
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:07,400
He made me pose as Don...

1657
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:10,300
...obtained the disc...

1658
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:15,500
...and a chance to kiII Singhania.

1659
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,400
Then faked his own death...

1660
02:29:21,300 --> 02:29:24,000
...and Ieft me to die as Don.

1661
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:35,400
DCP DesiIva... Vardhaan!

1662
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:37,400
You've pIayed a big move!

1663
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:40,000
But he must never have thought...

1664
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:42,800
...that I'd steaI the disc.

1665
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:50,000
Give the discto Vardhaan!

1666
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:53,200
Vijay! What are you saying?

1667
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:54,400
Yes, Roma.

1668
02:29:57,900 --> 02:29:59,100
AfinaI meeting with DCP DesiIva
is very important.

1669
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:15,200
AfinaI meeting with DCP DesiIva
is very important.

1670
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:16,300
Don't worry, darIing.

1671
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:19,800
Today wiII be the Iast day
of Vijay's Iife.

1672
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:41,200
I've reached the pIace
you toId me to...

1673
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:42,600
...aIone.

1674
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:43,600
Good.

1675
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:47,500
Buy a ticket from the counter.
There's a bridge on IeveI one...

1676
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:48,600
...come there.

1677
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:49,700
And yes...

1678
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:52,300
...don't forget the money...

1679
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:55,200
...or you'II have to
buy the ticket again.

1680
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:53,900
You seem to be
in a great hurry.

1681
02:31:54,700 --> 02:31:55,800
Now where do I go?

1682
02:31:58,800 --> 02:31:59,800
Throw the bag down.

1683
02:32:01,300 --> 02:32:01,800
What!?

1684
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:04,200
Throw the bag down.

1685
02:32:17,400 --> 02:32:18,900
I can see you, Jasjit...

1686
02:32:19,900 --> 02:32:21,300
...but I don't see the disc.

1687
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:24,500
You'II get what you want.

1688
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:25,700
Throw it.

1689
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:46,200
Looks good.

1690
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:48,300
Where's the disc?

1691
02:32:49,300 --> 02:32:51,600
Upper viewing pIatform.
SiIver briefcase.

1692
02:33:17,900 --> 02:33:18,900
Damn!

1693
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:31,600
Poor DCP DesiIva!

1694
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:33,100
You!

1695
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:35,800
What are you doing here?

1696
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:38,900
I shouId be asking
you that!

1697
02:33:39,700 --> 02:33:40,800
You're dead, remember?

1698
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:42,900
What do you want?
- Answers to some questions.

1699
02:33:43,700 --> 02:33:45,600
PIease! This is no time
for interviews!

1700
02:33:45,900 --> 02:33:48,400
AII right then. Here's
the second reason.

1701
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:50,500
I'm going to kiII
you today.

1702
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:58,900
You have the guts to shoot?

1703
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:01,100
You've trained me pretty weII.

1704
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:04,400
What wiII you gain
by kiIIing me?

1705
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:08,700
There are some deeds in which
profit and Ioss doesn't matter.

1706
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:12,300
They just have to be done.

1707
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:14,300
Very good!

1708
02:34:15,700 --> 02:34:19,300
But how wiII you prove your
innocence,if you kiII me?

1709
02:34:19,800 --> 02:34:21,800
OnIy I know your reaI identity.

1710
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:24,700
Perhaps that disccan be of use.
What do you think?

1711
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:28,400
You have the disc?

1712
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:29,600
No...

1713
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:32,400
It was my Iove for you that
dragged me here!

1714
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:36,400
Give me the disc.

1715
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:40,400
I'm ready to send you to
any corner of the worId.

1716
02:34:41,900 --> 02:34:42,700
Think it over.

1717
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:46,500
You must be exhausted
running from the poIice!

1718
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:49,200
Not as much as from thinking
over and over...

1719
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:52,700
...why you betrayed me?

1720
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:54,100
Come on, get over it.

1721
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:55,700
What betrayaI?!

1722
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:57,000
This is the reaI worId.

1723
02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:02,100
You think Singhania asked me
before seizing Boris' entire empire?

1724
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:05,600
I created the entire business!
With my inteIIigence and guts.

1725
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:09,600
And now to get it back,
I can use thousands Iike you.

1726
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:13,600
AII right.

1727
02:35:14,600 --> 02:35:15,800
I betrayed you.

1728
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:18,100
You want an apoIogy?

1729
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:20,200
I'm so sorry, Vijay!

1730
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:22,200
Happy?

1731
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:24,200
FeeI any better?!!

1732
02:35:25,300 --> 02:35:26,500
Use your head, Vijay.

1733
02:35:27,400 --> 02:35:28,400
There's stiII time...

1734
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:30,500
Join me.

1735
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:32,600
You wiII gain from it...

1736
02:35:34,300 --> 02:35:35,500
...and so wiII I.

1737
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:10,500
That's the signaI!

1738
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:13,000
AII teams move in.

1739
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:14,400
I repeat aII teams move in.

1740
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:17,800
Good boy! Come...

1741
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:37,600
Put your gun down.

1742
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,100
This is the poIice.

1743
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:40,100
I repeat...

1744
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:41,300
Put your gun down.

1745
02:38:20,700 --> 02:38:21,400
Stop, Vijay!

1746
02:38:26,300 --> 02:38:28,900
Don't make this mistake.
Hand him over to us.

1747
02:38:30,100 --> 02:38:31,200
PIease kiII me!

1748
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:35,600
You wiII be making a huge
mistake if you Iet me Iive.

1749
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:38,800
Don't Iisten to him!
He is trying to set you up!!

1750
02:38:39,100 --> 02:38:39,900
Shut up!

1751
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:44,300
Remember! Wherever you go...
someday I wiII find you...

1752
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:47,400
And that day wiII be the
Iast day of your Iife!

1753
02:38:47,400 --> 02:38:48,600
Don't Iisten to him, Vijay.

1754
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,400
After that, Roma.
Then, Deepu.

1755
02:38:52,400 --> 02:38:54,200
I'II kiII them both...

1756
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:57,100
...unIess you kiII me now.

1757
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:02,600
In that case, Vardhaan...

1758
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:05,600
...I'II be waiting for you.

1759
02:39:16,900 --> 02:39:17,700
Hurry up.

1760
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,100
Take him quickIy!

1761
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:34,300
Vijay?

1762
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:36,300
HoId on pIease.

1763
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,400
You finaIIy did it.

1764
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:43,400
You proved your innocence.

1765
02:39:44,600 --> 02:39:46,600
It wasn't possibIe without you.

1766
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:48,600
Thank you.

1767
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:53,800
Sir, we must take you to
the hospitaI right away.

1768
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:55,100
Yes, of course!

1769
02:39:55,400 --> 02:39:56,300
Come with me Roma.

1770
02:39:56,300 --> 02:39:57,000
Excuse me?

1771
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:58,400
Can't she come aIong
with us?

1772
02:39:58,700 --> 02:39:59,300
I'm sorry sir.

1773
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:00,700
Ma'am, pIease step aside.

1774
02:40:01,700 --> 02:40:02,000
Don't worry,

1775
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:03,600
I'II see you at the hospitaI.

1776
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:05,900
Vijay!

1777
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:10,400
I Iove you.

1778
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:22,400
Even I Iike wiId cats a Iot.

1779
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:51,400
Come doser.

1780
02:40:57,800 --> 02:41:00,200
I Iike wiId cats a Iot.

1781
02:41:03,800 --> 02:41:05,100
WiId cats!

1782
02:41:09,500 --> 02:41:10,400
Mr. MaIik, where's that
ambuIance going?

1783
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:11,300
One minute sir...

1784
02:41:11,800 --> 02:41:13,200
To the hospitaI.
Why, what's the matter?

1785
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:14,300
He is Don!

1786
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:17,800
''I Iike wiId cats a Iot...''

1787
02:41:18,400 --> 02:41:20,800
Don had said that to me...
whispered it in my ears!

1788
02:41:22,300 --> 02:41:25,700
If this is Vijay,
how did he know it?

1789
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:43,400
Have given him the 2 mI of
diazepam(a sedative)?

1790
02:41:43,900 --> 02:41:45,200
Yes Sir, Giving it right now.

1791
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:52,300
The doctors have kept him in
a sedated state.

1792
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:06,300
AII the marks and scars
that were on Don's body...

1793
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,200
...need to be made on you.

1794
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:09,300
