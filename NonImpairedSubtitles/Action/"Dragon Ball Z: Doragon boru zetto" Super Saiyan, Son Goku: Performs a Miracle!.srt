1
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,680
You should have kept your place.

2
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,360
Very well. I'll do it.

3
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,160
Let me warn you now, I won't be pulling any
punches just because you're a woman.

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,370
Then again, you're an Artificial Human.
You aren't a woman, are you?

5
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,350
Here!

6
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,870
Surprising.

7
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,890
He's got a much greater strength than in the
information Doctor Gero provided us.

8
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,890
Vegeta, huh?

9
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,050
Not too bad.

10
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,550
Looks like No. 18 is starting to play with him.

11
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,660
Hey, stackin' this way's awful
rough on me, ain't it?

12
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,830
Please, just hang in there for a little
while longer, Yajirobe-san.

13
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,900
Enough! Can't you do anything but complain?

14
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,940
How can you ask a question like that?

15
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,250
My belly's so empty! I gotta put away some chow!

16
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:19,960
Incredible. You have no class. Yeah, he's
such a poor example for you-huh?

17
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,700
Hey! This ain't funny!

18
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,000
Which one of us ain't got class now?

19
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,740
Please, stop shifting around there, Yajirobe-san!

20
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,680
You hush! I'm gettin' off! Take
us down! Take us down!

21
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,960
Whoa!

22
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,970
You're not getting away!

23
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,490
What am I supposed to do now?

24
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,870
I sure hope the Artificial Humans haven't
overtaken Gohan and Bulma-san.

25
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,520
Dad...

26
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,530
What's that?

27
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,850
What's the matter? Have you
stopped running from me?

28
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,360
You guys are just fooling, right?

29
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,980
What the-?

30
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,900
They've come back.

31
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:43,120
There's no way I can tell if you wind-up
mannequins suffer damage or not.

32
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,100
As such, I'll just have to blow you to pieces.

33
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,640
Enough so that you'll never smile again.

34
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:16,760
Hey, you numbskulls! What do you think
you're doing in the middle of the road?
Blithering halfwits!

35
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,030
If you don't get out of the way,
I'll run right over on top of you!

36
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,100
Just keep smiling, while you're still able to.

37
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,300
Hey, didn't you hear me!

38
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,780
Go ahead, try it.

39
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,680
Hey!

40
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,960
It looks as though you're faster than I thought.

41
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,540
Yoo-hoo!

42
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,880
Hello!

43
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,980
Hey there! Hey there!

44
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,990
So bouncy, bouncy!

45
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,860
So jiggly, jiggly!

46
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,890
Oh, for a camera!

47
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,930
It's been so long!

48
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Hi! Turtle-chan!

49
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,270
Hi!

50
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,080
No, not you, old man!

51
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,900
Turtle-chan! Turtle-chan!

52
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,450
Turtle-chan?

53
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,260
How cute!

54
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,640
Why, you...

55
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,190
You haven't been giving me your all, have you?

56
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,860
Of course not. If I gave it my all,
it would destroy the earth.

57
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,000
I haven't been giving it my
all, either. Could you tell?

58
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:17,140
In that case, don't hold back. You'd better give me your best while you can, or you'll regret it later.

59
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,810
Well then, I will.

60
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,530
Are you all right, Vegeta-san!?

61
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,210
Vegeta-san!

62
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,120
Unbelievable. You're such a bunch of pests!

63
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,060
You guys think you're any help
against an opponent like this?

64
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,120
My goodness. Could it be time to lend a hand?

65
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:23,800
Not even No. 18 would be able to take them
all on. Nothing left for me but to get in there.

66
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,970
Unless, No. 16, you want to go?

67
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,910
No, I'm not going.

68
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,710
Not going, huh? You really are slipshod.

69
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,050
Just what were you built for, anyhow?

70
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,490
I thought I told you. To kill Son Goku.

71
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,690
My, my, how nice for you to be so carefree.

72
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,830
Hey, No. 17 is headed this way.

73
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,110
Let's get out of here, Vegeta-san. If you get
killed, your pride won't be worth crap.

74
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,170
P- Please!

75
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:07,340
You want another beating? You're
in our way! Get lost, now!

76
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:14,120
If you want to run, you're free to do so. We don't have any interest in that which flees.

77
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:21,460
Don't be ridiculous. Why should I find it necessary to run when I'm about to obliterate you?

78
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,800
Get this straight-lf it comes down to fighting
alongside Earthlings, or Nameksei-jins.

79
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,470
...or Kakarotto, for that matter...

80
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,840
...I'd rather fight by myself and die!

81
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,150
Very nice commentary.

82
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,690
Coupled with your fighting style, you're every bit worthy to be prince of the Saiyajins.

83
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,330
It's not up to you wind-up dolls to say so.

84
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,670
Particularly a kid like you.

85
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:10,770
However, in the hopes that each of you hold the code of Bushido dear, I'm putting you on notice.

86
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:17,950
I don't think anyone here would interfere in
Vegeta and No. 18's one-on-one fight,

87
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:24,290
but if you do, I will have to join in as well.

88
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:31,500
These guys are cowardly pacifists. You don't have to trouble yourself for them to stay out of it.

89
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,820
Fine, then.

90
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,200
Shall we keep going?

91
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,670
Of course we will!

92
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,830
That's my boy!

93
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,940
You're getting me irritated, pretending
like nothing's happened.

94
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:31,790
You surprise me. Even being an alien, I didn't think any man could push me this far.

95
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,460
Is the man Son Goku even stronger?

96
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,130
Don't be absurd. He may have pulled ahead
for a while, but now, as it should be...

97
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,140
...I'm stronger than he is.

98
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,130
You don't say. Then you're not all
that great, either one of you.

99
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,840
W- What was that!

100
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,190
Go! Go get her!

101
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,660
Incredible. I hadn't realized
that Dad was so incredible.

102
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:23,370
He's actually holding his own against one
of those terrible Artificial Humans.

103
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,210
He's going to get killed. Vegeta, I mean.

104
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,540
Watch!

105
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,050
It's just a little bit each time, but the Artificial Human is starting to get the upper hand.

106
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:53,240
His opponent hardly loses any power, but for every move Vegeta makes, his stamina drops proportionately.

107
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,240
Shoot!

108
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,370
Goku, what should we do!?

109
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,060
Dad!!

110
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,550
No, you fool!

111
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:02,200
Vegeta is in trouble. Without thinking,
Trunks leaps to his aid.

112
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:11,510
However, how should they do battle against the Artificial Humans and their unmeasurable power?
