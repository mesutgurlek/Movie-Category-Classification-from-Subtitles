1
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:41,118
Wake up

2
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:45,383
Logan, you are here.
I couldn't believe it when they told me.

3
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:48,758
Logan 6.

4
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,655
It's not every day
they authorize a new Sandman.

5
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:54,391
I'll tell you, Francis, that's him.

6
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:55,899
Maybe, maybe not.

7
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:58,335
What does it matter?
He isn't yours anymore.

8
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,475
All right, you want me to wake him?

9
00:03:05,014 --> 00:03:06,140
Break-in.

10
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:07,280
Now you've done it.

11
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:10,680
Scanners report intrusion. Identify.

12
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:14,117
Logan 5, Francis 7,
authorized duty quadrant.

13
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:16,416
Intrusion accidental.

14
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:20,322
Clear, Logan 5. Clear, Francis 7.

15
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,466
All right, Francis, I'm with you.

16
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:49,121
Only the crazies
hang around nursery.

17
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:51,556
There'll be a couple of new
Sandmen tomorrow.

18
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:52,591
How do you know?

19
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:54,787
Some of our guys
are on Carrousel tonight.

20
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:56,693
And Sandmen always renew.
I know.

21
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:59,201
But you don't know. You just assume.

22
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:02,668
One for one. What everyone's
been taught. One for one.

23
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:05,001
Why not? That's how
everything works.

24
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,372
IKeeps everything in balance.
One is terminated, one is born.

25
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,843
Simple, logical, perfect.

26
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:14,446
-You have a better system?
-Of course not.

27
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:18,849
At least I wonder about it sometimes.
Not like you with your automatic routine.

28
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:21,286
You sound like a sleep
teacher with a stuck tape.

29
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:23,722
Leave it alone, it's perfect.

30
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:31,934
You know, Logan, you wonder a lot.

31
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:33,797
Too much for a Sandman.

32
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,371
Why were you so angry just then?

33
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:37,974
What did he do to you?

34
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:41,202
That red's going to run.
I can always tell.

35
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,438
Did you ever see Francis 8?

36
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,714
I never even visited nursery
before tonight.

37
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:51,688
You know, when you question,
it slows you down.

38
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:56,054
I don't know.
What makes you so curious?

39
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:58,520
You know who his seed-mother was?

40
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,291
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.

41
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,593
Good.

42
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:08,468
Look at the crowd.
Good Carrousel tonight.

43
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,278
Last Day, Capricorn 15s.

44
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,247
Year of the city, 2274.

45
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,686
Carrousel begins.

46
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,658
Last Day, Capricorn 15s.

47
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,532
Year of the city, 2274.

48
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,403
Carrousel begins.

49
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,720
Would you mind?

50
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,258
Thanks a lot.

51
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,031
A few over there
could have been his seed-mother.

52
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,774
Only a few?

53
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,872
You're just not trying.

54
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,617
Capricorn 15s...

55
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:29,756
...born 2244...

56
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,255
...enter the Carrousel.

57
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,294
This is the time of renewal.

58
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,750
Be strong...

59
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:07,428
...and you will be renewed.

60
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:14,360
Identify.

61
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:20,675
Rise.

62
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:34,981
Renew! Renew!

63
00:08:59,245 --> 00:08:59,939
Come on!

64
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:24,932
Higher!

65
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:28,697
Renew! Renew!

66
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:35,973
Renew!

67
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:40,617
Renew!

68
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,267
Renew!

69
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:02,832
Affirmative!

70
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,239
Renew!

71
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,390
Run, runner!

72
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,825
Did you hear him? Run!

73
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:00,794
-Hold it!
-Runner!

74
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,820
Runner terminated, 0.31 .

75
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:34,499
Ready for cleanup.

76
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:43,708
Request identity check.

77
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,148
Affirmative.

78
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,533
He was good, wasn't he?

79
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:16,669
Showed he had some life in him
in the end.

80
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:19,472
That was a great shot you made.

81
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,240
You kept missing him.
I had to do something.

82
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:27,518
It's crazy.
He could have renewed on Carrousel.

83
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:29,211
Now he's finished forever.

84
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:30,856
Why do they run?

85
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:06,115
Hello.

86
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:09,520
Welcome.

87
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,998
Please, no.

88
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:28,037
Please?

89
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:29,507
No?

90
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:34,344
Come on.

91
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:44,693
What's wrong?

92
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,928
You prefer women?

93
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:51,563
Well?

94
00:15:53,805 --> 00:15:56,137
Nothing, I felt sad.

95
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,468
I put myself on the circuit.

96
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:00,040
It was a mistake.

97
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:01,678
Sad?

98
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,472
Why do you feel sad?

99
00:16:04,182 --> 00:16:06,378
A friend of mine went on Carrousel.

100
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:07,943
Now he's gone.

101
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:10,188
Yes, well...

102
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:11,822
...l'm sure he was renewed.

103
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,857
He was killed.

104
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:14,957
Like the others.

105
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:17,359
IKilled? Why do you use that word?

106
00:16:17,963 --> 00:16:19,794
Isn't that what you do? IKill?

107
00:16:27,306 --> 00:16:29,604
I've never killed anyone in my life.

108
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:31,742
Sandmen terminate runners.

109
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:34,711
What's your name?

110
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:36,806
Jessica.

111
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:40,084
That's sad enough.

112
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:41,584
You're beautiful.

113
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:43,483
Let's have sex.

114
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,453
Then why are you wasting my time?

115
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:47,320
Why'd you put yourself
on the circuit?

116
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:51,025
I thought I had to do something.

117
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:53,363
I told you it was a mistake...

118
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,534
...and I've changed my mind.

119
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:57,669
Because I'm a Sandman?

120
00:16:58,305 --> 00:16:59,636
Am I your first?

121
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,067
Yes.

122
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:03,836
And I'm curious.

123
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:05,409
About what?

124
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:07,136
How a Sandman lives.

125
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,645
It's a little different from
most people...

126
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:13,377
...but I assure you we have the same
feelings as everybody else.

127
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:15,446
If you're feeling curious it's--

128
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:17,146
Not about that.

129
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:18,188
What, then?

130
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:22,225
Why is it wrong to run?

131
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,798
You shouldn't think such things...

132
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,569
...let alone talk about them.

133
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:33,873
Look, you know what to do.

134
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:36,634
You try like hell for renewal.

135
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:40,075
Otherwise, when this
turns to black, that's it.

136
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:44,815
But if for some strange reason
you want to be 31 ...

137
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,045
...then you have the same chance
as everyone.

138
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:48,488
Like your friend.

139
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:50,087
Carrousel.

140
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:53,983
But...

141
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:58,055
...if you're one of the misfits...

142
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:01,296
...that's where I come in.

143
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:03,300
I didn't say that I would run.

144
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:04,802
I just...

145
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:08,870
How old are you?

146
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:10,806
I'm a 6.

147
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:12,912
I go red next year.

148
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:17,509
You're years away.

149
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:21,587
What quad do you live in?

150
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,019
IK.

151
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:27,121
You're quite sure you don't want to...?

152
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:30,926
It's nice to know you can nod.

153
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:34,567
It's nice to know you can do that too.

154
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:38,668
I've been looking all over for you.

155
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,104
We're having a party, right?

156
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:43,334
Hey, Francis.

157
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:45,046
They're great.

158
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,714
Let's fade out.

159
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:56,889
Give me my screamer back.

160
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,686
They're mine now.

161
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,371
What happened?

162
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,803
-I lost a runner in Cathedral.
-How come?

163
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:13,374
Ran into some cubs.

164
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:15,474
One of them cut me
all the way down.

165
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,080
Cubs.

166
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:18,837
I'm off to New You for repairs.

167
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,449
Get yourself a new face while you're
at it. They know you now.

168
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:27,389
I might look in on the New You myself.
Number 483.

169
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:30,020
-You? Why?
-It's that last runner.

170
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:32,162
He got a face change
on Last Day.

171
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:34,593
If so, someone in 483
was trying to help him.

172
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,198
Check it out.

173
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,863
Got a runner in power center.

174
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:46,103
What's with you?

175
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,801
Last night.

176
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:49,343
You had a kicker.

177
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,447
She must have got him in the head.

178
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:12,696
Identify.

179
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:17,098
Clear, Francis 7.

180
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:26,815
There goes another one.

181
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,925
Why do they run
instead of going on Carrousel?

182
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:35,993
Good one.

183
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:38,992
Runner terminated, power center.

184
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,895
7 1 06, identification correct.

185
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:50,170
-See you in the hydro toner.
-Be right with you.

186
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:34,185
Logan 5...

187
00:21:35,357 --> 00:21:37,791
...approach and identify.

188
00:21:47,502 --> 00:21:50,369
Sit facing the screen, Logan 5.

189
00:21:57,613 --> 00:21:59,171
Identify.

190
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:22,099
Do you identify this object?

191
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:29,241
Negative.

192
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:31,745
Question: What is it?

193
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:34,841
That is the name of the object. Ankh.

194
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:41,681
Do you identify this word...

195
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:43,519
"...Sanctuary"?

196
00:22:45,562 --> 00:22:46,859
Negative.

197
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:51,163
Sanctuary is a pre-
catastrophe code word...

198
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:53,836
...used for a place of immunity.

199
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,271
I don't understand.

200
00:22:58,475 --> 00:22:59,567
The object ankh...

201
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:03,904
...has been identified with
the code word "Sanctuary. "

202
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:06,373
The object and the word both relate...

203
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:10,075
...to runners who have
not been accounted for.

204
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,753
-Question--
-Hold.

205
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,294
Unaccounted runners: 1056.

206
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,759
You may state your question.

207
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,498
1 056 unaccounted for?

208
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,327
The number is correct.

209
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,468
That's impossible.

210
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:34,569
Question:
Maybe they weren't all runners.

211
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:37,748
Maybe most of them reached
life renewal on Carrousel.

212
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,185
Question:

213
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,521
Nobody reached renewal?

214
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,829
But everybody believes that some--

215
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,329
The question was answered.

216
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:02,007
You mean, nobody's ever been renewed?

217
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,535
The question has been answered.

218
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,314
You are authorized
to penetrate city seals...

219
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,746
...and search outside the dome.

220
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,381
The seals?

221
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,984
Question: What seals?

222
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:18,856
Outside?

223
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,193
There's nothing outside.

224
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:25,153
You will find Sanctuary and destroy.

225
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:29,462
Question:

226
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,035
What if I need help
from another Sandman?

227
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:35,507
Negative. You will begin
assignment by becoming...

228
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,904
...a runner seeking Sanctuary.

229
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:39,442
Question:

230
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,477
I'm only red six now.

231
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:45,348
How can I pretend that I'm
approaching Last Day?

232
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,779
Identify.

233
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:35,967
My life clock.

234
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,865
Question: My life clock?

235
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,669
Retrogram complete.

236
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:47,472
Procedure 033-03.

237
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:51,816
But am I still red 6?

238
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:56,618
I had four more years.

239
00:25:57,526 --> 00:25:59,586
I will get them back, won't l?

240
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:03,654
You will take the object ankh
with you for identification.

241
00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:06,533
Question:

242
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:09,898
Do I get my four years back?

243
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:24,907
What the hell took you so long?

244
00:27:25,116 --> 00:27:26,048
It was...

245
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:27,582
...the debriefing.

246
00:27:28,753 --> 00:27:31,085
It was more complicated than usual.

247
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:33,450
Come on, get in the water.

248
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:40,197
Did you ever see anybody renew?

249
00:27:42,902 --> 00:27:46,565
You've been skulling out too much.
First nursery, and now silly questions.

250
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,831
But did you?

251
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:50,939
Did I what?

252
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:52,232
See anybody renewed?

253
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:54,109
Of course.

254
00:27:56,115 --> 00:27:57,104
Anybody we know?

255
00:27:58,651 --> 00:27:59,743
Look...

256
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:01,385
...get into the water.

257
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,248
You need it more than I do.

258
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,888
Francis, I have to talk to you.

259
00:28:08,794 --> 00:28:09,556
I'll see you.

260
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,505
Here I am.

261
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:24,336
Now tell me why.

262
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:26,001
I couldn't get you out of my mind.

263
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:28,408
I'm the most beautiful woman
you ever saw, I suppose.

264
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:30,581
Maybe.

265
00:28:30,884 --> 00:28:33,944
-And you must have me?
-Yes. Something like that.

266
00:28:34,154 --> 00:28:37,089
-Just like that?
-Yes, why not?

267
00:28:37,624 --> 00:28:39,216
But I still have the choice?

268
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:41,125
Of course.

269
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:44,055
Then the answer's still no.

270
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,866
No, I don't believe you.

271
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,961
-That's why you had me brought here?
-Would you have come on your own?

272
00:28:51,172 --> 00:28:53,697
Well, there it is. I was right.

273
00:28:57,245 --> 00:28:59,577
You can have any woman in the city.

274
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:01,576
What do you really want?

275
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:08,849
Why show me?

276
00:29:09,057 --> 00:29:10,547
Because I'm going to run.

277
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:13,155
Why tell me?

278
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:15,022
You know something.

279
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,700
About running? Dying, what?

280
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:23,838
Both. But running
is what I'm interested in.

281
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:26,269
I know what everyone knows.

282
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,967
Try like hell for renewal. You have the
same chance as anyone else. Carrousel.

283
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:33,876
Look, don't you understand?
It's different now because it's me!

284
00:29:34,116 --> 00:29:35,378
My life.

285
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:38,351
Help me.

286
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:41,552
How can l?

287
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:47,853
Where'd you get that?

288
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:50,362
I got it from a runner.

289
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,158
And then you killed him.

290
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:54,029
It was my job.

291
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:55,499
But now...

292
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,406
...it's different.

293
00:29:57,607 --> 00:29:58,904
Believe me.

294
00:30:00,343 --> 00:30:01,469
I don't.

295
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:03,910
Speak to your friends for me.

296
00:30:04,414 --> 00:30:05,506
What friends?

297
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:07,307
Look, I don't have much time!

298
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:09,877
I never heard of
a Sandman running, ever.

299
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:13,680
And I never heard of Sanctuary.

300
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:55,899
First level, near the hand.

301
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:59,870
Don't look for us, we'll see you.

302
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:03,107
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.

303
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,399
Can you do it?

304
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:06,140
Will you?

305
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:08,945
Tonight?

306
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:11,481
Yes.

307
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:13,885
I'm sorry, Jessica.

308
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:15,609
We all are.

309
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:18,679
But he has heard about Sanctuary.

310
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:21,916
And that makes him
dangerous to all of us.

311
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:24,260
Doesn't it?

312
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:33,971
Oh, thanks, Francis.
I can use a break.

313
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:36,572
Just don't take forever,
like last time.

314
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:40,371
You love it. You're afraid
you'll miss a really good run.

315
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:03,193
You spoke to them?

316
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:05,803
Them?

317
00:32:09,243 --> 00:32:10,210
Why are you here?

318
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:14,775
I'm here to help you.

319
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:18,017
Come with me to Arcade.

320
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,171
Wait, Logan.

321
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,544
We have to talk.

322
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,175
Yes, we have to.

323
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,218
What is it?

324
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:55,547
A runner. In Cathedral.

325
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,918
A woman. Come on.

326
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:05,927
You better go home.

327
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:08,103
I'd rather be with you.

328
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:12,471
Logan's got a mean one tonight.

329
00:33:12,675 --> 00:33:14,700
-Cathedral. I better help him.
-Watch out.

330
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,378
Careful, they'll cut you to pieces
before you see them.

331
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,133
Are the cubs really as wild
as they say?

332
00:33:44,374 --> 00:33:45,739
Never been there, have you?

333
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,466
No, of course not.

334
00:33:48,211 --> 00:33:51,476
You wanted to come with me.
You'll find out.

335
00:33:53,016 --> 00:33:54,711
They're wild, all right.

336
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:58,246
They're the violent ones. There's no
place else for them, unless they change.

337
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,850
People say it's because they're
born in breeders.

338
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,117
Had you heard that?

339
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:06,621
We're all born in breeders.

340
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:09,957
But most of us don't end up
running wild in Cathedral.

341
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:14,104
No, but they say human mothering
might be better.

342
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:18,638
I wish I'd known my mother.

343
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,848
Where do you get these crazy ideas?

344
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:28,748
When did you begin to question
Last Day?

345
00:34:30,388 --> 00:34:32,015
I didn't say I questioned it.

346
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,154
Do you?

347
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,755
Entering a reservation
for violent delinquents.

348
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,429
Authorized persons only.

349
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:03,144
I've never been in this quadrant before.

350
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:09,592
Request door open, Cathedral Plaza.

351
00:35:09,795 --> 00:35:12,059
Logan 5 authorized
to enter risk area.

352
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:14,129
They shut it to keep in the cubs.

353
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:19,734
Let me go first.

354
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:23,839
Sometimes they're
waiting just inside there.

355
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:28,036
Quick, before it closes.

356
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:03,181
Don't be afraid.

357
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:07,043
What's your name?

358
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:09,052
Mary 2.

359
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,357
Where do you live?

360
00:36:11,558 --> 00:36:12,820
Here.

361
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,424
Why aren't you in nursery?

362
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:20,257
I'm very smart.

363
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:21,432
When are you green?

364
00:36:22,503 --> 00:36:23,436
When do you go up?

365
00:36:24,672 --> 00:36:27,197
I never go upstairs.

366
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:30,706
You're a nice old lady.

367
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:36,476
No, don't.

368
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:38,276
Might be a decoy.

369
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,940
Runner!

370
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:21,357
Watch out!

371
00:37:23,732 --> 00:37:26,098
Circle! Circle!

372
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:27,768
Get behind them.

373
00:37:28,504 --> 00:37:29,733
Don't let them get away.

374
00:37:30,473 --> 00:37:31,633
Billy, come on!

375
00:37:31,841 --> 00:37:33,809
Billy, we've got one!

376
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:37,203
We've got a runner and his pair-up.

377
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:39,439
And look who decided to run.

378
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,644
I cut up a Sandman yesterday.

379
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:45,452
They said I'd never get him,
but I cut him up good.

380
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:47,816
I feel sorry for you, boy.

381
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:49,522
For me?

382
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,793
You better feel sorry for yourself.

383
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:55,656
I feel sorry for you, Billy.

384
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:57,162
How old are you?

385
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:59,130
1 4? 1 5?

386
00:37:59,336 --> 00:38:02,306
Your time is running out here.
How long have you got left here?

387
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:06,566
A year, six months? What happens
when you're 1 6 and you go to green?

388
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:10,708
Nothing will happen. Nothing!
I make the rules here.

389
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:12,815
No cubs over 1 5, Billy!

390
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:16,575
Look, have you ever seen
a cub who's turned to green?

391
00:38:17,154 --> 00:38:18,314
You'll have to leave then...

392
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:20,922
...because they won't let you stay here.

393
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:23,925
And if you do try and stay here...

394
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:27,097
...your young friends here
will rip your guts apart!

395
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:32,900
Muscle!

396
00:38:37,643 --> 00:38:40,771
All right, children, playtime's over.

397
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:50,785
How many of you want this
to be Last Day?

398
00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:53,449
Come on,
we can rush him!

399
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:58,258
Come on, we can take him again!

400
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:11,301
Come on! Cut me!

401
00:39:58,459 --> 00:39:59,448
Runner?

402
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:13,933
There's been a terrible error.

403
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:17,736
My life clock must have
broken in some way.

404
00:40:17,946 --> 00:40:19,470
I'm nowhere near 30.

405
00:40:20,782 --> 00:40:21,771
I'm 22.

406
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:24,881
I should be green.
Did you hear me? Green!

407
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:28,055
-Now, don't be afraid!
-Let me go! Let me go!

408
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:30,952
I am not going to hurt you.

409
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,592
Now, look.

410
00:40:32,794 --> 00:40:33,852
There.

411
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:35,962
There. See?

412
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,365
We want to help you.

413
00:40:47,376 --> 00:40:48,138
Sanctuary?

414
00:40:57,086 --> 00:40:59,145
This means nothing to you?

415
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:02,916
Listen...

416
00:41:03,826 --> 00:41:06,454
...if they find you, throw this
hard enough to break it.

417
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:09,222
But remember, don't breathe
until you get away.

418
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:11,591
It's blind gas.

419
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:29,073
Runner?

420
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:39,425
Runner terminated at 0. 1 6.

421
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:42,427
Ready for clean up,
Cathedral quadrant 39.

422
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:50,099
I must tell you now. When we were in
Arcade, I was taking you to be killed.

423
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,303
I'm sorry, I didn't believe you.

424
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,645
But you do now?

425
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,341
Of course.

426
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,985
You let the runner go.

427
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,052
Then tell me where Sanctuary is.

428
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,951
Take me to your friends.

429
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,718
I can't tell you.

430
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,061
And if I take you to them,
they'll kill you.

431
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,254
But you saw me let her go.
Tell them.

432
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,490
They won't listen. You're a Sandman.

433
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,566
They won't take the chance.

434
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,542
Request maze car, Cathedral Plaza.

435
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,344
Stand by to open door.

436
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:51,197
It's open.

437
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:53,464
Come on, we got to go.

438
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,346
Where will you go now?

439
00:43:01,547 --> 00:43:02,844
Back to Arcade.

440
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:04,846
I'm going to get a new face.

441
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:06,848
But you can't, you're a runner.

442
00:43:07,053 --> 00:43:08,350
No one will do it.

443
00:43:08,554 --> 00:43:10,579
There's New You 483.

444
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,621
I think there's someone
there can help me.

445
00:43:13,626 --> 00:43:14,888
Maybe there is.

446
00:43:30,243 --> 00:43:32,678
The cheeks could be narrowed,
the mouth changed....

447
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,647
Please let me know as soon as you've
made your selection.

448
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:39,752
I'll let you know as soon
as she's decided.

449
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,858
Hello, Sandman.

450
00:43:46,894 --> 00:43:48,384
We don't get many Sandmen.

451
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:51,393
I think we've had only one
since I've been here.

452
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:54,294
A Sandman can get as sick
of his face as anyone else.

453
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:57,902
Doc, there's a Sandman here.
Can you see him?

454
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:02,701
Doc is ready, Sandman.

455
00:44:04,846 --> 00:44:08,282
I recommend a more detailed study
of our projections.

456
00:44:08,483 --> 00:44:11,782
There are new suggestions for your
consideration....

457
00:44:15,824 --> 00:44:19,282
-This is a real privilege, Sandman.
-For me too.

458
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:24,728
I thought you'd be older.

459
00:44:24,933 --> 00:44:26,764
I mean, I was expecting a red.

460
00:44:27,702 --> 00:44:28,862
I am.

461
00:44:30,238 --> 00:44:31,102
Your own work?

462
00:44:31,606 --> 00:44:33,267
Yes, I did it myself.

463
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:36,607
Right on there.

464
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,077
I'll show you.

465
00:44:43,786 --> 00:44:45,947
This is the Aesculaptor Mark 3.

466
00:44:46,155 --> 00:44:49,147
The latest.
It's completely self-contained.

467
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,085
It has a tilt bed and cryojectors
in the platform.

468
00:44:59,301 --> 00:45:00,962
Well, Sandman, what will it be?

469
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,502
Face job? Full-body job?

470
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:04,832
Just the face.

471
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,975
Fine, Holly'll get you ready.

472
00:45:07,443 --> 00:45:09,502
You're in expert hands.

473
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,579
Believe me.

474
00:45:18,388 --> 00:45:20,720
Will you get on the table, please?

475
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,448
Want me to take my clothes off?

476
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,287
Not for your face.

477
00:45:28,832 --> 00:45:30,800
You shouldn't have brought him here.

478
00:45:32,002 --> 00:45:33,970
I didn't bring him.

479
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:36,466
What's the difference?

480
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,673
He's blinking.

481
00:45:40,177 --> 00:45:41,610
He wants to run.

482
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:43,374
Run?

483
00:45:43,581 --> 00:45:45,014
He's a Sandman.

484
00:45:48,653 --> 00:45:51,121
I tell you, he's running. I know.

485
00:45:51,556 --> 00:45:52,716
Maybe.

486
00:45:53,257 --> 00:45:55,487
I just wish he'd gone somewhere else.

487
00:45:57,328 --> 00:45:58,693
All right, he gets a face.

488
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:01,122
I like dark hair.

489
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:03,729
Tell him to give you dark hair.

490
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:06,069
All set?

491
00:46:06,704 --> 00:46:08,899
Did you have anything special in mind?

492
00:46:09,307 --> 00:46:10,171
I don't care, just--

493
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:12,638
Dark hair.

494
00:46:13,644 --> 00:46:15,077
Oh, yes.

495
00:46:15,513 --> 00:46:17,744
Holly would like dark hair.

496
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:21,245
We'll start by narrowing
the cheekbones.

497
00:46:41,707 --> 00:46:44,232
With this, there's no waiting
for scar burnishing.

498
00:46:44,576 --> 00:46:46,373
It's all in one.

499
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:47,906
Watch now.

500
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,347
Here's the improvement.

501
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:54,854
Instant healing before you feel a thing.

502
00:46:58,424 --> 00:46:59,823
Hello, yes?

503
00:47:00,226 --> 00:47:01,625
Yes, they are.

504
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:07,327
Done.

505
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,300
Pay attention, Sandman.

506
00:47:13,973 --> 00:47:15,634
I'm proud of this machine.

507
00:47:17,844 --> 00:47:20,779
Perfect depth adjustment on this one.

508
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:24,439
The beam will cut through that uniform
and just through the skin beneath.

509
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:26,318
Absolute precision.

510
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:28,452
Watch now.

511
00:47:33,327 --> 00:47:35,295
Just imagine what would happen...

512
00:47:35,496 --> 00:47:37,930
...if the healing stopped functioning.

513
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,565
Doc, the machine is spinning!

514
00:47:45,773 --> 00:47:46,797
Right! It's a trap.

515
00:47:47,007 --> 00:47:47,837
They know.

516
00:47:51,512 --> 00:47:52,706
I'm a runner!

517
00:48:20,008 --> 00:48:22,568
-What's going on?
-Get out of my way! Get off me!

518
00:48:23,778 --> 00:48:27,111
What are you talking about?
I saw you let a runner go.

519
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:30,143
In Cathedral.

520
00:48:30,353 --> 00:48:31,251
I was there!

521
00:48:48,237 --> 00:48:49,169
Follow me.

522
00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:50,737
Stay close.

523
00:48:51,674 --> 00:48:53,642
We've got to go through the Love Shop.

524
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:26,139
Where'd they go?

525
00:49:26,343 --> 00:49:28,243
A Sandman and a green?

526
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:30,207
Didn't you see them?

527
00:51:43,651 --> 00:51:46,746
-Why do you run from your friend?
-Because he is my friend.

528
00:51:47,122 --> 00:51:50,421
I don't want to be killed by him,
or anyone else.

529
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:52,149
He's good, isn't he?

530
00:51:52,627 --> 00:51:57,030
You mean, will he find us and kill us?
Yes. Or one of the others will.

531
00:51:57,466 --> 00:51:59,696
You know, they won't believe us.

532
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:03,462
Maybe not. But I'd rather take my
chance with them than with Francis.

533
00:52:03,672 --> 00:52:04,866
They won't listen.

534
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,201
Do you think Sandmen will?

535
00:52:09,344 --> 00:52:10,868
There's no other way for me.

536
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:13,739
We'll convince them.

537
00:52:52,556 --> 00:52:54,023
You better stay behind me.

538
00:52:54,224 --> 00:52:55,885
How will they know we're coming?

539
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,055
They're watching us now.

540
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:01,329
They'll let us in when they're sure.

541
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:12,336
There, 1 7th Quadrant IK.

542
00:53:12,543 --> 00:53:13,908
-Whose signal?
-Logan 5.

543
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,739
-Who's available?
-7, 9 and Arcade Patrol.

544
00:53:17,014 --> 00:53:20,472
Sandman, put your hands on your head.

545
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:24,152
Clasp your fingers together.

546
00:53:24,355 --> 00:53:27,188
Now turn your hands over. Palms up.

547
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,320
In a moment, a light will shine
in your eyes.

548
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:35,329
Walk into it. Jessica first.
Then you, Sandman.

549
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:38,525
You will have to stoop,
but don't unclasp your hands.

550
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:40,226
Do you agree?

551
00:53:53,051 --> 00:53:55,042
Move against the pillar.

552
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,154
Up against it!

553
00:54:04,296 --> 00:54:05,888
Look, I'm a runner.

554
00:54:07,399 --> 00:54:10,129
She brought me here because
I begged her to help me.

555
00:54:12,438 --> 00:54:15,965
-He's lying.
-No Sandman ever ran.

556
00:54:16,175 --> 00:54:17,870
You don't run.

557
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:19,066
You kill runners.

558
00:54:19,278 --> 00:54:21,007
You have always killed runners.

559
00:54:21,213 --> 00:54:22,908
Yes, I have.

560
00:54:23,515 --> 00:54:25,244
But now it's my turn.

561
00:54:25,884 --> 00:54:27,545
And I find I want to live.

562
00:54:27,987 --> 00:54:29,353
What's the matter with you?

563
00:54:29,656 --> 00:54:32,352
He's a runner! He's blinking!

564
00:54:32,892 --> 00:54:35,759
We must help anyone who asks. We must!

565
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,565
Or we're the same as they are,
deciding who lives or dies!

566
00:54:48,408 --> 00:54:51,241
Holly. Holly New You 483.

567
00:54:51,444 --> 00:54:52,843
He's dead. Doc is dead.

568
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:54,669
And the Sandman came.

569
00:54:56,483 --> 00:54:57,472
It's him!

570
00:54:57,684 --> 00:54:58,582
He killed Doc.

571
00:55:00,086 --> 00:55:01,144
Wait!

572
00:55:02,023 --> 00:55:03,650
He's running.

573
00:55:04,158 --> 00:55:05,182
Tell them the rest!

574
00:55:05,426 --> 00:55:06,688
He's the one.

575
00:55:06,894 --> 00:55:08,657
And you, too. I remember.

576
00:55:08,863 --> 00:55:10,296
He was in a hurry.

577
00:55:10,498 --> 00:55:11,795
A face job only.

578
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:14,399
And I said, dark hair.

579
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,263
And then he killed Doc...

580
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:19,200
...and you grabbed me and the machine
blew up and I ran.

581
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,470
I ran.

582
00:55:22,476 --> 00:55:23,966
Holly, please!

583
00:55:24,812 --> 00:55:26,746
The other Sandman.

584
00:55:27,148 --> 00:55:28,080
Remember?

585
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,281
The one who came after?

586
00:55:39,594 --> 00:55:41,118
That's right.

587
00:55:42,064 --> 00:55:43,656
The other one came after.

588
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,401
And he was hunting the first one,
wasn't he?

589
00:55:49,337 --> 00:55:50,634
Wasn't he?

590
00:55:51,606 --> 00:55:53,164
This one was running...

591
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:56,742
...and the other one
was hunting him, remember?

592
00:56:03,752 --> 00:56:05,583
He was after you.

593
00:56:07,522 --> 00:56:09,252
I remember.

594
00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:11,656
You were running.

595
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:22,469
I say we pass them through.

596
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:33,110
Runner...

597
00:56:33,316 --> 00:56:35,682
...follow the corridor
with the pipes overhead.

598
00:56:36,085 --> 00:56:38,383
The way is always down.

599
00:56:38,588 --> 00:56:41,114
Then this isn't Sanctuary?

600
00:56:41,325 --> 00:56:43,486
No, you must follow the tunnel...

601
00:56:43,694 --> 00:56:44,854
...to the end.

602
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:47,823
Where do I go from there?

603
00:56:48,031 --> 00:56:50,795
When you come to the lock,
there will be a message.

604
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:53,826
After that, there's no turning back.

605
00:56:54,037 --> 00:56:56,835
No. Jessica goes back now.

606
00:56:58,075 --> 00:56:59,042
Do you hear me?

607
00:56:59,243 --> 00:57:00,301
You must go back now.

608
00:57:02,446 --> 00:57:03,913
No, I'm going with you.

609
00:57:04,782 --> 00:57:07,751
No, it's not possible. No, you
must go back.

610
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:09,643
Somebody take her back.

611
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:11,821
See that she gets out of here.

612
00:57:13,457 --> 00:57:14,584
Please...

613
00:57:14,793 --> 00:57:15,817
...it's dangerous.

614
00:57:16,427 --> 00:57:17,894
I don't care.

615
00:57:18,963 --> 00:57:20,863
I want to go to Sanctuary.

616
00:57:21,065 --> 00:57:22,191
Take me with you?

617
00:57:23,268 --> 00:57:25,964
Jessica, why?

618
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:28,401
You're still a green.
You're not running.

619
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:31,575
It doesn't matter what I am.

620
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,500
I want to be with you.

621
00:58:19,526 --> 00:58:20,993
Listen to me!

622
00:58:22,162 --> 00:58:26,030
I'm your friend. I understand.
We all go crazy once in a while.

623
00:58:26,967 --> 00:58:30,596
Nobody knows except me. I won't tell.
I could have turned you in. I didn't.

624
00:58:32,305 --> 00:58:33,329
But she's a runner.

625
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:36,137
And it's over.

626
00:58:36,977 --> 00:58:39,810
Terminate her! Now!

627
00:58:41,514 --> 00:58:43,311
You're a Sandman! Now, Logan. Now!

628
00:58:43,884 --> 00:58:44,851
Stay out of it!

629
00:59:18,886 --> 00:59:20,547
What do we do now?

630
00:59:22,189 --> 00:59:24,384
Runner, this is the last gate.

631
00:59:24,592 --> 00:59:26,026
Use your key now.

632
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:29,356
When the bell sounds again,
use your key.

633
00:59:29,564 --> 00:59:32,499
Good luck, runner.
May you find Sanctuary.

634
00:59:45,781 --> 00:59:47,874
I still have the key I took
from the runner.

635
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,082
There.

636
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,993
We must be somewhere under the city.

637
01:00:40,738 --> 01:00:43,764
I'd always heard the city received its
power from the sea...

638
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,532
...but this looks forgotten.

639
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:47,267
Unused.

640
01:01:09,768 --> 01:01:11,861
Runner, this is the last gate.

641
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,503
Use your key now.

642
01:01:13,705 --> 01:01:14,899
When the bell sounds....

643
01:01:23,782 --> 01:01:25,477
What do you suppose this was?

644
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:28,550
Looks like some sort of breeding pen.

645
01:01:29,554 --> 01:01:32,022
They say people used to breed
animals, fish, anything.

646
01:01:33,591 --> 01:01:34,956
To eat, you know?

647
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,925
Must have been a savage world.

648
01:01:57,616 --> 01:01:59,106
He said go down.

649
01:06:02,736 --> 01:06:04,601
Maybe we can put these around us.

650
01:06:04,805 --> 01:06:07,797
Let's take our clothes off first,
before they freeze on us.

651
01:06:36,604 --> 01:06:37,798
Welcome, humans.

652
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:41,505
I am ready for you.

653
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,305
Fish, plankton...

654
01:06:44,512 --> 01:06:47,640
...sea greens and protein from the sea.

655
01:06:48,649 --> 01:06:50,446
Fresh as harvest day.

656
01:06:52,754 --> 01:06:55,746
Overwhelming, am I not?

657
01:06:55,957 --> 01:06:57,948
Are you, too, startled?

658
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:01,322
Am I too removed from your ken?

659
01:07:01,529 --> 01:07:02,791
What...?

660
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:04,490
Who are you?

661
01:07:04,966 --> 01:07:07,060
I'm more than machine...

662
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:08,702
...or man.

663
01:07:08,904 --> 01:07:11,998
More than a fusion of the two.

664
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:14,202
Don't you agree?

665
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:19,846
Wait for the winds.

666
01:07:20,048 --> 01:07:22,744
Then, my birds...

667
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:24,248
...sing...

668
01:07:24,453 --> 01:07:28,219
...and the deep grottoes
whisper my name.

669
01:07:29,224 --> 01:07:30,657
Box!

670
01:07:31,093 --> 01:07:32,685
Box!

671
01:07:32,895 --> 01:07:35,056
Box!

672
01:07:37,065 --> 01:07:39,796
This place is a link
to Sanctuary, isn't it?

673
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:41,626
Link?

674
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:43,904
How do you think we got here?

675
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:46,134
Same as the others.

676
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:47,570
Don't you remember?

677
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:49,404
Why do you think we're here?

678
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:51,378
Why?

679
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:52,548
Why?

680
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,077
We were sent here. And you know it.

681
01:07:57,287 --> 01:08:00,552
You say others have been sent here.
Where are they?

682
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:02,322
In hiding?

683
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:04,583
Hiding?

684
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:06,853
Yes.

685
01:08:07,163 --> 01:08:08,425
Hiding.

686
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:10,961
You know about Sanctuary.

687
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:12,260
I know you do.

688
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:15,030
-Sanctuary?
-You have to help us.

689
01:08:15,573 --> 01:08:18,633
You don't have a choice!
It's not your decision!

690
01:08:18,843 --> 01:08:20,105
So tell us!

691
01:08:20,444 --> 01:08:21,468
Very well.

692
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,306
Follow me.

693
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,447
This way.

694
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,500
How'd they get there?

695
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:51,505
Regular storage procedure.

696
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,507
The same as the other food.

697
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:57,204
The other food stopped coming,
and they started.

698
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:00,074
What other food?

699
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:04,385
Fish and plankton and sea greens...

700
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:06,489
...and protein from the sea.

701
01:09:06,691 --> 01:09:08,022
It's all here.

702
01:09:08,326 --> 01:09:09,293
Ready.

703
01:09:09,494 --> 01:09:11,860
Fresh as harvest day.

704
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,395
Fish and plankton.

705
01:09:14,599 --> 01:09:17,660
Sea greens and protein from the sea.

706
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,929
And then it stopped coming...

707
01:09:20,139 --> 01:09:21,936
...and they came instead.

708
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:24,439
So I store them here.

709
01:09:25,011 --> 01:09:26,638
I'm ready...

710
01:09:26,846 --> 01:09:28,404
...and you're ready.

711
01:09:30,216 --> 01:09:31,683
It's my job...

712
01:09:32,285 --> 01:09:33,445
...to freeze you!

713
01:09:33,653 --> 01:09:35,143
Protein...

714
01:09:35,821 --> 01:09:38,756
...plankton, grass from the sea!

715
01:09:54,841 --> 01:09:56,103
My birds!

716
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:57,977
My birds!

717
01:10:47,028 --> 01:10:48,359
What is it?

718
01:10:49,697 --> 01:10:51,096
I don't know.

719
01:10:53,401 --> 01:10:55,028
Whatever it is...

720
01:10:55,236 --> 01:10:56,602
...it's warm.

721
01:11:02,478 --> 01:11:04,537
We must be outside.

722
01:12:34,739 --> 01:12:37,072
I didn't know any place
could be like this.

723
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:40,739
Everything hurts.

724
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,085
I hate outside!

725
01:12:50,288 --> 01:12:52,688
-I hate it! I hate it!
-Jessica!

726
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:55,985
It's all right.
Come on, it's all right!

727
01:12:56,762 --> 01:12:58,696
We'll be all right. Don't worry.

728
01:13:00,298 --> 01:13:01,697
We'll get there.

729
01:13:03,535 --> 01:13:05,298
Just got to find some water.

730
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,049
It's dark...

731
01:13:19,252 --> 01:13:20,685
...and cold.

732
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:23,216
And I'm tired.

733
01:13:23,489 --> 01:13:25,753
Come on. We must get out of here.

734
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:27,152
Sorry.

735
01:13:27,727 --> 01:13:29,922
I can't go any further.

736
01:13:34,467 --> 01:13:36,332
Let's rest in here.

737
01:13:55,756 --> 01:13:58,156
Do you think everything
will turn to ice?

738
01:13:59,293 --> 01:14:00,726
I doubt it.

739
01:14:04,631 --> 01:14:06,326
Don't ever let go.

740
01:14:08,368 --> 01:14:09,665
I won't.

741
01:14:15,643 --> 01:14:17,736
It all seemed to make sense...

742
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:20,040
...until Box.

743
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:24,018
You think he was telling the truth?

744
01:14:24,819 --> 01:14:26,514
What truth?

745
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,783
Perhaps we're the first people
to get through.

746
01:14:33,328 --> 01:14:36,161
Maybe Sanctuary isn't far now.

747
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:39,991
Another protected place.

748
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,831
Can't be outside.

749
01:14:43,037 --> 01:14:44,732
Who would ever know?

750
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:47,542
And even if we find it...

751
01:14:48,043 --> 01:14:49,977
...we can't go back now.

752
01:14:56,018 --> 01:14:58,486
No, you're right.

753
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:00,348
It must be near now.

754
01:15:02,258 --> 01:15:03,691
We'll find it.

755
01:15:08,631 --> 01:15:09,598
Look!

756
01:15:09,798 --> 01:15:11,129
Logan, look!

757
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:12,231
Water!

758
01:15:56,881 --> 01:15:58,041
Look.

759
01:15:58,616 --> 01:16:00,413
Look at your palm.

760
01:16:01,252 --> 01:16:02,219
The crystal.

761
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:03,944
It's clear.

762
01:16:04,455 --> 01:16:06,047
What does it mean?

763
01:16:07,558 --> 01:16:10,425
The life clocks have no power outside.

764
01:16:11,662 --> 01:16:13,152
We're free!

765
01:16:21,005 --> 01:16:22,404
You can have...

766
01:16:22,606 --> 01:16:24,471
...any woman in the city.

767
01:16:25,042 --> 01:16:26,806
What do you really want?

768
01:16:27,412 --> 01:16:28,743
You know.

769
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:33,150
The choice is still mine?

770
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,285
Of course.

771
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:40,155
This time...

772
01:16:41,093 --> 01:16:42,856
...the answer's yes.

773
01:17:14,327 --> 01:17:16,227
It must be Sanctuary!

774
01:17:16,429 --> 01:17:17,896
Outside?

775
01:17:18,364 --> 01:17:19,831
Exposed?

776
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,658
But it must be.

777
01:17:23,836 --> 01:17:26,202
Whatever it is, there are
probably people there.

778
01:17:26,406 --> 01:17:27,964
And food and shelter.

779
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:29,674
Come on.

780
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,165
What do you suppose happened
to the people?

781
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:33,334
I don't know. They must have left here.

782
01:18:33,808 --> 01:18:35,503
A long time ago.

783
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:38,710
I wonder what they were like.

784
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,639
That must be one of them.

785
01:19:09,545 --> 01:19:11,673
Then they looked almost like us.

786
01:19:12,749 --> 01:19:13,841
Except...

787
01:19:14,885 --> 01:19:17,376
...l've never seen a face
like that before.

788
01:19:18,822 --> 01:19:19,754
That must be...

789
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:23,888
...the look of being old.

790
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:05,200
They've all got names
and numbers on them.

791
01:20:06,537 --> 01:20:08,232
I wonder what they are?

792
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,565
"Beloved husband." "Beloved wife."

793
01:20:12,009 --> 01:20:13,943
I wonder what it means.

794
01:22:54,143 --> 01:22:55,132
Who are you?

795
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:59,475
Who are you?

796
01:23:02,953 --> 01:23:04,784
I'm Logan 5.

797
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:08,515
This is Jessica 6.

798
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:14,119
I never much cared for my name,
even when I could remember it.

799
01:23:16,299 --> 01:23:17,891
We're from the city.

800
01:23:22,773 --> 01:23:25,241
Yes, we came through the ice.

801
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:28,306
We got past Box.

802
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:30,440
Box?

803
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:35,284
This is Sanctuary, isn't it?

804
01:23:38,256 --> 01:23:39,883
Sanctuary?

805
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:46,790
May I see your hand?

806
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:04,237
Look at his face.

807
01:24:04,449 --> 01:24:05,974
His hair.

808
01:24:07,252 --> 01:24:10,949
-Is that what it is to grow old?
-I guess so, yes.

809
01:24:11,223 --> 01:24:13,214
But how old are you?

810
01:24:13,425 --> 01:24:15,620
I don't know. I'm as old...

811
01:24:15,828 --> 01:24:18,023
...as I am, I suppose.

812
01:24:19,832 --> 01:24:21,891
Your hair is white.

813
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,568
Yes, well, it wasn't always
that color, you know.

814
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:27,330
I got my color someplace here.

815
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:31,202
It wasn't your color.
It wasn't much like hers, either.

816
01:24:32,644 --> 01:24:34,908
Those cracks in your face...

817
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:36,102
...do they hurt?

818
01:24:40,086 --> 01:24:41,519
Can I touch them?

819
01:24:42,055 --> 01:24:43,454
Oh, my.

820
01:24:43,790 --> 01:24:44,984
Try.

821
01:25:03,476 --> 01:25:04,807
Are you alone here?

822
01:25:05,879 --> 01:25:07,642
Hardly.

823
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:14,446
I got all these cats.

824
01:25:17,491 --> 01:25:20,324
Is that what they're called? Cats?

825
01:25:20,594 --> 01:25:22,425
And they've each got
their own name.

826
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:25,463
Cats, of course, what else
would they be called?

827
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:26,925
Cats!

828
01:25:28,569 --> 01:25:30,560
You know they've each got three names?

829
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:34,605
The naming of cats
is a difficult matter.

830
01:25:34,808 --> 01:25:37,606
It's not just one of your
holiday games.

831
01:25:37,811 --> 01:25:39,676
You may think at first
I'm mad as a hatter...

832
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,408
...when I tell you that each cat's got
three different names.

833
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:46,680
See, they got their ordinary name...

834
01:25:47,022 --> 01:25:49,889
...and then they got their fancy name.

835
01:25:50,592 --> 01:25:52,822
And that makes two names, doesn't it?

836
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:54,927
Now it's got a third name.

837
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:58,429
Can either of you two guess
what that third name is?

838
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:01,092
Come on!

839
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,674
Above and beyond...

840
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:09,571
...there's one name that's left over...

841
01:26:09,778 --> 01:26:13,077
...and this is the name
you never will guess.

842
01:26:13,381 --> 01:26:17,112
The name no human research
can discover...

843
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:19,618
...but the cat itself knows...

844
01:26:19,822 --> 01:26:21,380
...and never will confess.

845
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:23,115
Will you, Henry?

846
01:26:25,628 --> 01:26:27,357
How long have you been living here?

847
01:26:28,464 --> 01:26:30,864
A little longer than I can remember.

848
01:26:33,135 --> 01:26:35,103
What kind of a place is this?

849
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:37,767
Well, it's...

850
01:26:37,974 --> 01:26:40,306
...just a place, you know.
Just a place.

851
01:26:42,244 --> 01:26:43,176
How'd you get here?

852
01:26:44,413 --> 01:26:46,404
I've always been here. Hello, Thomas.

853
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:48,847
Are there other people?

854
01:26:49,986 --> 01:26:51,420
Oh, gracious, no.

855
01:26:51,622 --> 01:26:54,216
Has anyone else ever passed
through here?

856
01:26:54,424 --> 01:26:57,621
There may be a few out there.
I don't know.

857
01:26:58,929 --> 01:27:00,260
What makes you think that?

858
01:27:01,398 --> 01:27:03,025
My parents told me.

859
01:27:03,233 --> 01:27:04,564
My mother...

860
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:10,866
...and my father.

861
01:27:11,842 --> 01:27:14,003
You knew your mother and father?

862
01:27:14,411 --> 01:27:16,345
Sure, they raised me.

863
01:27:18,849 --> 01:27:20,373
How were you grown?

864
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:22,545
Inside your mother?

865
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:24,754
Right in there.

866
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,684
Are you sure?

867
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:29,252
That's what she told me.

868
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:32,224
I have to believe her. I don't know.

869
01:27:33,297 --> 01:27:34,286
Where are they?

870
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:35,530
What was that?

871
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:37,397
Where are they now?

872
01:27:37,635 --> 01:27:38,795
Where?

873
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:40,493
They're dead.

874
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:43,003
They are dead. Yeah.

875
01:27:43,207 --> 01:27:44,435
Buried.

876
01:27:45,643 --> 01:27:46,575
Buried?

877
01:27:47,912 --> 01:27:49,243
They're buried.

878
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,652
Gus was the cat at the theater door.

879
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:03,260
His name, and I should have told
you before, is really Asparagus.

880
01:28:03,462 --> 01:28:05,453
But that's such a fuss to pronounce.

881
01:28:05,664 --> 01:28:08,792
...we call him just Gus.

882
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:14,764
Why did you want to see my hand before?

883
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,971
You'd better show me yours.

884
01:28:19,078 --> 01:28:20,670
Yes, you had.

885
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:26,050
That's lovely.

886
01:28:26,251 --> 01:28:27,775
That's beautiful.

887
01:28:29,355 --> 01:28:31,016
Can I have one of these?

888
01:28:34,461 --> 01:28:37,123
I'm sorry. It's not possible.

889
01:28:38,965 --> 01:28:41,024
That's just not fair.

890
01:28:41,501 --> 01:28:42,559
Hello.

891
01:28:43,603 --> 01:28:46,367
I'll give you one of my best cats,
my favorite.

892
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,808
I'll give you a Jellicle cat. I will.

893
01:28:50,009 --> 01:28:53,342
I'm sorry, I really don't have
anything to give you.

894
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:55,509
That's the truth.

895
01:28:56,382 --> 01:28:57,576
You hear that?

896
01:28:57,784 --> 01:29:00,446
Here, you can have this.

897
01:29:01,989 --> 01:29:03,889
What is that treasure?

898
01:29:04,091 --> 01:29:05,683
I don't know.

899
01:29:08,095 --> 01:29:11,155
You don't know. You're full
of secrets as Macavity.

900
01:29:11,532 --> 01:29:14,501
Macavity, Macavity.
There's no one like Macavity.

901
01:29:14,702 --> 01:29:18,866
There never was a cat of such
deceitfulness and suavity.

902
01:29:21,575 --> 01:29:24,203
What lies beyond this place?
Do you know?

903
01:29:24,445 --> 01:29:25,878
Welleverity.

904
01:29:27,381 --> 01:29:30,817
I don't know, nothing. Nothing there.

905
01:29:31,018 --> 01:29:34,317
Did your father or mother ever
mention another place?

906
01:29:34,855 --> 01:29:37,654
My mother? No, she never
mentioned any other.

907
01:29:37,859 --> 01:29:39,451
Nothing at all.

908
01:29:43,632 --> 01:29:45,497
May we stay here?

909
01:29:46,268 --> 01:29:47,895
We'd like to rest awhile.

910
01:29:48,336 --> 01:29:50,361
Of course. This belongs to the people.

911
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:56,775
-What belongs to the people?
-Certainly does. All of it.

912
01:29:59,548 --> 01:30:00,742
What people?

913
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:03,476
All of them. It's marked
on the wall someplace.

914
01:30:03,685 --> 01:30:05,118
All the people, all the time...

915
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,787
...shall not....

916
01:30:08,591 --> 01:30:10,115
I'll be right back.

917
01:30:14,297 --> 01:30:16,595
That sweet madman.

918
01:30:17,733 --> 01:30:19,997
How could he come to exist?

919
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:23,168
He had a mother and a father.

920
01:30:23,472 --> 01:30:26,498
And they spent their lives together.

921
01:30:28,477 --> 01:30:30,604
One in a million, I suppose.

922
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:32,579
Who knows?

923
01:30:38,788 --> 01:30:40,848
We are going on, aren't we?

924
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:44,487
There's nothing to go on to.

925
01:30:45,596 --> 01:30:47,223
There's Sanctuary.

926
01:30:47,431 --> 01:30:48,420
There is.

927
01:30:49,633 --> 01:30:51,066
You want there to be one, but--

928
01:30:51,268 --> 01:30:52,826
There has to be!

929
01:30:53,203 --> 01:30:54,534
I know it exists.

930
01:30:54,738 --> 01:30:57,764
-It has to.
-No, it does not. Not really.

931
01:30:58,442 --> 01:31:02,139
Just so many people want it to exist,
so many people who don't want to die...

932
01:31:02,346 --> 01:31:06,282
...they want it so much that a place
called Sanctuary becomes real.

933
01:31:06,483 --> 01:31:10,010
But it doesn't exist. It never existed.

934
01:31:11,321 --> 01:31:12,310
Just the hope.

935
01:31:12,522 --> 01:31:13,820
You're wrong!

936
01:31:14,025 --> 01:31:16,585
-It has to be! It has to be!
-Oh, Jessica.

937
01:31:20,265 --> 01:31:21,493
Oh, my.

938
01:31:21,699 --> 01:31:23,530
Don't cry.

939
01:31:26,337 --> 01:31:30,330
Look, I got some bigger ones of these
over there. I don't know who they all are.

940
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:32,839
I think they must be family.

941
01:31:33,044 --> 01:31:34,841
That'll cheer you up.

942
01:31:35,046 --> 01:31:37,537
That's my color. That's what it is.

943
01:31:37,749 --> 01:31:39,842
Leave her alone.

944
01:31:55,034 --> 01:31:57,229
Surprised you, Doris, didn't he?

945
01:31:57,870 --> 01:32:00,031
Now, I don't know who these all are.

946
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:03,106
I'm quite used to them.
They all look the same to me now.

947
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:07,040
When I first found them,
they were a little different.

948
01:32:10,883 --> 01:32:13,477
You know, feel free to look at them.

949
01:32:13,686 --> 01:32:16,655
But they're all old men.

950
01:32:17,923 --> 01:32:21,325
Father said that one of these people...

951
01:32:21,528 --> 01:32:24,292
...never told a lie.
I don't know which one it is.

952
01:32:28,535 --> 01:32:30,799
You thought I wouldn't find you,
didn't you?

953
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:33,296
You thought I'd quit, huh?

954
01:32:34,407 --> 01:32:36,102
What did you do to him?

955
01:32:37,043 --> 01:32:39,841
You know what he was?
He was a Sandman.

956
01:32:40,046 --> 01:32:41,638
He was happy.

957
01:32:42,248 --> 01:32:45,183
You ruined him. You killed him.

958
01:32:47,387 --> 01:32:48,649
Wait.

959
01:32:49,456 --> 01:32:51,947
I've seen this face before.

960
01:32:53,394 --> 01:32:54,520
Yes, isn't he the...

961
01:33:21,188 --> 01:33:22,553
Logan!

962
01:33:34,102 --> 01:33:34,966
Why, Logan?

963
01:33:36,004 --> 01:33:37,096
Why?

964
01:33:38,173 --> 01:33:40,539
Is this good? ls this what you want?

965
01:33:44,312 --> 01:33:46,143
We had good times.

966
01:33:48,016 --> 01:33:48,983
I let you go.

967
01:33:49,918 --> 01:33:51,510
You wouldn't terminate a runner...

968
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,620
...and I covered for you!

969
01:33:54,623 --> 01:33:56,284
Why did you let her?

970
01:33:57,192 --> 01:33:59,354
And now, I have to finish you.

971
01:34:00,897 --> 01:34:03,297
You are terminated, runner.

972
01:34:03,866 --> 01:34:05,925
Francis, look at your palm.

973
01:34:06,302 --> 01:34:08,202
Go on. Look at it.

974
01:34:09,472 --> 01:34:11,099
Go on, look at it!

975
01:34:15,745 --> 01:34:17,804
Believe me, it's true.

976
01:34:18,481 --> 01:34:20,073
This isn't the truth.

977
01:34:20,283 --> 01:34:21,978
This is a lie!

978
01:34:40,404 --> 01:34:42,497
Francis, stop! Listen!

979
01:36:29,749 --> 01:36:32,115
That was the right shot.

980
01:36:33,853 --> 01:36:35,684
Watch out, now.

981
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:37,915
He's tricky.

982
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:40,884
He'll fool you.

983
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:57,168
You renewed.

984
01:37:41,623 --> 01:37:43,784
I don't want to say anymore...

985
01:37:43,992 --> 01:37:47,621
...but I hope that is understood,
young woman.

986
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:49,263
Of course.

987
01:37:49,732 --> 01:37:52,030
Now don't forget...

988
01:37:52,368 --> 01:37:54,302
...you promised.

989
01:37:54,504 --> 01:37:55,562
We'll remember.

990
01:37:55,772 --> 01:37:57,933
But that's a long time off.

991
01:37:58,541 --> 01:38:00,202
I wish I knew, but....

992
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:02,207
Long time off.

993
01:38:08,017 --> 01:38:09,644
What are we promising him?

994
01:38:10,586 --> 01:38:14,545
He asked if we would bury him
when his time comes.

995
01:38:15,224 --> 01:38:16,657
We can't.

996
01:38:19,962 --> 01:38:21,521
We're going back.

997
01:38:21,732 --> 01:38:23,029
Back?

998
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:24,733
To what?

999
01:38:24,935 --> 01:38:26,664
I have to tell them the truth.

1000
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:30,067
You won't be able
to tell anybody anything.

1001
01:38:30,274 --> 01:38:31,764
You'll be killed.

1002
01:38:31,975 --> 01:38:33,602
Not when they've learned of this.

1003
01:38:33,811 --> 01:38:35,176
They won't listen.

1004
01:38:35,379 --> 01:38:37,438
Things don't change.

1005
01:38:38,749 --> 01:38:41,843
We can stay here together.

1006
01:38:42,052 --> 01:38:44,145
Have a life as long as his together.

1007
01:38:44,355 --> 01:38:46,789
Jessica, things do change. Look.

1008
01:38:46,990 --> 01:38:49,515
You're lying. You don't want
to change anything.

1009
01:38:49,727 --> 01:38:51,354
You want to go back to kill!

1010
01:38:51,562 --> 01:38:53,189
-Listen to me.
-Francis was right!

1011
01:38:53,397 --> 01:38:56,663
-You really--
-Look. Listen to me.

1012
01:38:58,103 --> 01:39:00,901
The life clocks made me kill Francis.

1013
01:39:01,306 --> 01:39:04,139
They kill people every single day.

1014
01:39:04,843 --> 01:39:08,244
If I don't go back
and try to stop that...

1015
01:39:08,446 --> 01:39:10,539
...destroy them...

1016
01:39:10,749 --> 01:39:12,512
...l can't live here.

1017
01:39:12,717 --> 01:39:14,514
I couldn't live anywhere.

1018
01:39:15,487 --> 01:39:17,717
Don't you understand that?

1019
01:39:17,922 --> 01:39:19,389
All I want...

1020
01:39:19,591 --> 01:39:22,492
...is to be alive and with you.

1021
01:39:22,694 --> 01:39:24,321
That's all.

1022
01:39:25,397 --> 01:39:28,060
Do you think I want anything
different now?

1023
01:39:38,043 --> 01:39:39,943
Must we leave soon?

1024
01:39:41,547 --> 01:39:43,481
As soon as it gets light.

1025
01:39:55,161 --> 01:39:58,460
We're going to have to leave you
in the morning.

1026
01:40:01,735 --> 01:40:04,499
What kind of people are you?

1027
01:40:05,071 --> 01:40:08,666
She promised you'd stay here
and bury me! You did!

1028
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:10,433
Come with us.

1029
01:40:12,546 --> 01:40:14,741
Yes. Come with us.

1030
01:40:14,948 --> 01:40:16,609
Yes, you must.

1031
01:40:16,817 --> 01:40:18,045
We need you now.

1032
01:40:18,251 --> 01:40:21,687
If people see you,
then they must believe us.

1033
01:40:23,223 --> 01:40:24,918
Where you going?

1034
01:40:25,592 --> 01:40:29,824
We're going to a city with thousands
and thousands of people.

1035
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:31,190
Young people.

1036
01:40:31,398 --> 01:40:33,924
All the people, all the time.

1037
01:40:34,135 --> 01:40:35,397
Five million.

1038
01:40:35,603 --> 01:40:37,161
How many...?

1039
01:40:38,306 --> 01:40:39,773
Is that more than my cats?

1040
01:40:39,974 --> 01:40:41,202
More.

1041
01:40:41,409 --> 01:40:42,603
Much, much more.

1042
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:46,507
More than...? Oh, my!
And all of them alive!

1043
01:40:49,817 --> 01:40:52,047
Is it a long journey?

1044
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,312
It's a journey.

1045
01:40:58,559 --> 01:41:01,255
We lived in most of these houses.

1046
01:41:01,462 --> 01:41:03,760
But they became too small for us...

1047
01:41:03,965 --> 01:41:06,662
...and ran out of mice, I guess.
I don't know.

1048
01:41:09,838 --> 01:41:12,102
I used to come fishing here...

1049
01:41:12,307 --> 01:41:15,435
...but somehow all the fish died.
Long time ago, now.

1050
01:41:15,644 --> 01:41:18,204
Nothing sadder than a dead fish.

1051
01:41:18,514 --> 01:41:22,507
All young people, you say?
I don't even remember what....

1052
01:41:22,718 --> 01:41:25,482
Although, of course,
the young people, yeah....

1053
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:30,447
They say this thing
used to be called a road.

1054
01:41:30,659 --> 01:41:33,287
Had to give bits of metal to use it.

1055
01:41:35,397 --> 01:41:36,694
How far away is it?

1056
01:41:37,733 --> 01:41:39,861
It's much further than it looks.

1057
01:41:40,069 --> 01:41:40,967
It's big.

1058
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:43,730
It's cold. Let's go back to the fire.

1059
01:41:44,941 --> 01:41:47,239
-We'll be there soon.
-Soon?

1060
01:41:51,047 --> 01:41:53,777
That's worth its weight in gold.

1061
01:41:54,217 --> 01:41:57,050
That is, when it's cold.

1062
01:42:01,424 --> 01:42:04,222
You know, I've been thinking.

1063
01:42:04,427 --> 01:42:06,418
Those words we saw...

1064
01:42:06,629 --> 01:42:10,065
..."Beloved husband." "Beloved wife."

1065
01:42:11,034 --> 01:42:12,002
What do they mean?

1066
01:42:12,202 --> 01:42:13,965
Oh, well, you see...

1067
01:42:14,271 --> 01:42:17,263
..."Beloved wife" would mean
my mother, see?

1068
01:42:17,474 --> 01:42:20,136
And "Beloved husband" would be
more like...

1069
01:42:21,612 --> 01:42:22,909
...my father.

1070
01:42:23,647 --> 01:42:28,107
-They use those words to stay together.
-Stay together?

1071
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:30,651
-I can't put it any different.
-But you mean....

1072
01:42:31,088 --> 01:42:34,546
I mean, they lived together
all their years?

1073
01:42:36,694 --> 01:42:38,355
Before I come along, I don't know.

1074
01:42:38,562 --> 01:42:40,996
But after, yeah, they did.

1075
01:42:42,266 --> 01:42:46,294
So people stayed together
for this feeling of love?

1076
01:42:46,504 --> 01:42:49,632
They would live and raise children...

1077
01:42:49,841 --> 01:42:51,138
...and be remembered?

1078
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:55,370
They raised me, didn't they?
Right in there.

1079
01:42:58,083 --> 01:43:00,051
I think I'd like that.

1080
01:43:00,251 --> 01:43:01,445
Don't you?

1081
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:06,088
Why not?

1082
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:09,751
Beloved husband.

1083
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:16,392
Beloved wife.

1084
01:43:16,601 --> 01:43:18,194
Beloved son.

1085
01:43:20,306 --> 01:43:21,534
Here we go.

1086
01:43:25,678 --> 01:43:27,009
That's right.

1087
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:35,076
You mean to say those people know
ahead of time when they'll die?

1088
01:43:35,821 --> 01:43:37,152
-That's right.
-That's silly.

1089
01:43:37,356 --> 01:43:39,381
What's the reason for that?

1090
01:43:39,792 --> 01:43:42,522
That's the way things are.
The way they've always been.

1091
01:43:42,728 --> 01:43:44,628
It takes all the fun out of dying.

1092
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:47,025
But if they're all
shut up tight in there...

1093
01:43:47,233 --> 01:43:49,292
...how we going to get to see them?

1094
01:43:49,502 --> 01:43:51,562
All the young people?

1095
01:43:51,772 --> 01:43:52,932
What'd you say?

1096
01:44:00,614 --> 01:44:02,138
What does the water do?

1097
01:44:02,349 --> 01:44:04,283
Must be part of the power system.

1098
01:44:04,618 --> 01:44:07,451
The ocean tides are turned
into energy somehow.

1099
01:44:08,221 --> 01:44:10,951
-Does it go inside the city?
-Yes, I think so.

1100
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:12,648
I don't know where, though.

1101
01:44:12,893 --> 01:44:15,657
Just took it for granted,
like everything else.

1102
01:44:16,329 --> 01:44:18,263
I think it's our only chance.

1103
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:30,372
Here, let me help you!

1104
01:44:30,578 --> 01:44:33,638
No, I can look after myself.

1105
01:44:33,848 --> 01:44:35,873
If ever a time comes...

1106
01:44:36,317 --> 01:44:39,445
...when I can't look after myself,
I said to my cats...

1107
01:44:39,654 --> 01:44:41,986
" ...Why, that's the moment
that you...."

1108
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:43,657
Where are you?

1109
01:44:46,894 --> 01:44:48,486
I'll have to tell him.

1110
01:44:50,264 --> 01:44:53,028
We're going to try and
get in through here.

1111
01:44:54,268 --> 01:44:55,701
I'm sorry...

1112
01:44:55,903 --> 01:44:57,872
...l don't think you can make it.

1113
01:44:58,073 --> 01:45:01,873
Oh, my. I was so looking forward
to seeing all those people.

1114
01:45:02,077 --> 01:45:04,238
I want you to meet them too.

1115
01:45:06,148 --> 01:45:09,117
Stay here as long as you can.

1116
01:45:09,318 --> 01:45:10,546
We'll bring them to you.

1117
01:45:10,753 --> 01:45:12,345
All the people?

1118
01:45:13,455 --> 01:45:14,854
You know...

1119
01:45:15,057 --> 01:45:16,718
...they've never seen a cat.

1120
01:45:17,025 --> 01:45:19,653
People have never seen a cat?

1121
01:45:38,882 --> 01:45:40,509
Oh, my.

1122
01:47:47,147 --> 01:47:48,512
Don't go in there!

1123
01:47:49,316 --> 01:47:50,840
You don't have to die!

1124
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:53,177
No one has to die at 30!

1125
01:47:54,054 --> 01:47:55,885
You can live!

1126
01:47:56,156 --> 01:47:57,282
Live!

1127
01:47:59,126 --> 01:48:01,617
Live and grow old!

1128
01:48:01,995 --> 01:48:03,394
I've seen it!

1129
01:48:03,597 --> 01:48:04,894
She's seen it!

1130
01:48:05,933 --> 01:48:07,230
Look!

1131
01:48:07,901 --> 01:48:09,061
Look!

1132
01:48:09,269 --> 01:48:10,964
Look, it's clear!

1133
01:48:12,339 --> 01:48:14,035
Last Day...

1134
01:48:14,542 --> 01:48:16,134
...Capricorn 29s.

1135
01:48:16,344 --> 01:48:19,711
Year of the city 2274.

1136
01:48:20,448 --> 01:48:22,973
Carrousel begins.

1137
01:48:23,418 --> 01:48:25,716
No! Don't!

1138
01:48:26,721 --> 01:48:27,585
Don't go!

1139
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:30,352
Listen to him!

1140
01:48:30,959 --> 01:48:33,018
He's telling the truth!

1141
01:48:33,995 --> 01:48:35,189
We've been outside!

1142
01:48:35,630 --> 01:48:38,497
There's another world outside!

1143
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:39,826
We've seen it!

1144
01:48:40,034 --> 01:48:42,229
The life clocks are a lie!

1145
01:48:42,437 --> 01:48:44,234
Carrousel is a lie!

1146
01:48:44,439 --> 01:48:46,772
There is no renewal!

1147
01:48:47,576 --> 01:48:49,510
Nobody's going to be renewed!

1148
01:48:49,712 --> 01:48:51,441
Believe me!

1149
01:48:51,647 --> 01:48:53,239
Please listen!

1150
01:49:00,723 --> 01:49:02,247
Logan 5...

1151
01:49:02,524 --> 01:49:05,254
...did you find Sanctuary?

1152
01:49:06,695 --> 01:49:09,596
Did you find Sanctuary?

1153
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,992
We will begin surrogation.

1154
01:49:32,422 --> 01:49:34,583
Your surrogates are engaged.

1155
01:49:39,295 --> 01:49:40,592
Logan 5...

1156
01:49:40,797 --> 01:49:44,494
...you were assigned to find a place
called Sanctuary.

1157
01:49:44,701 --> 01:49:46,191
Report.

1158
01:49:48,671 --> 01:49:53,609
There is no Sanctuary.

1159
01:49:54,612 --> 01:49:58,207
Unacceptable. The answer
does not program.

1160
01:49:59,583 --> 01:50:01,107
You were assigned to locate...

1161
01:50:01,318 --> 01:50:03,115
...missing runners.

1162
01:50:03,554 --> 01:50:05,681
State what you found.

1163
01:50:06,557 --> 01:50:09,754
All frozen.

1164
01:50:11,262 --> 01:50:14,720
The input does not program, Logan 5.

1165
01:50:14,932 --> 01:50:16,593
You may not resist.

1166
01:50:16,801 --> 01:50:19,167
An old...

1167
01:50:20,604 --> 01:50:21,866
...man.

1168
01:50:23,274 --> 01:50:25,539
You must not resist, Logan 5.

1169
01:50:26,244 --> 01:50:28,678
Did you find Sanctuary?

1170

An old man.

1172

Confirm outside.

01:50:45,163 --> 01:50:48,496
Old ruins...

1175
01:50:48,667 --> 01:50:50,328
...exposed.

1177
01:51:00,513 --> 01:51:03,004
