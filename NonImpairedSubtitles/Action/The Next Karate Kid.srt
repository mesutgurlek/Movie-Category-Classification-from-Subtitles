1
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,172
Good to see you also.

2
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:30,512
Ah, Louisa, beautiful Louisa.

3
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:38,156
Although many of our families
were locked up in internment camps...

4
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:42,524
weJapanese-Americans fought valiantly
for our country in World War Two.

5
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,798
<i>We forged a special bond of friendship</i>
<i>with our white officers...</i>

6
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,961
<i>realizing that all of us</i>
<i>believed in the ideals...</i>

7
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,597
<i>that forged our country.</i>

8
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,039
<i>In battles in Italy and France...</i>

9
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:01,937
<i>we became one of the most decorated</i>
<i>army units in World War Two.</i>

10
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:07,214
Today, the President
of the United States honors us...

11
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,585
with a special unit citation.

12
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,020
<i>The citation will be accepted</i>
<i>on our behalf...</i>

13
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:18,223
<i>by</i> S<i>ergeant</i> K<i>etsuke Miyagi</i>
<i>and Mrs. Louisa Pierce...</i>

14
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,528
<i>the widow of LieutenantJack Pierce.</i>

15
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:26,337
These men were legendary soldiers
in a regiment of heroes.

16
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,341
Attention!

17
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,274
Guard! Colors.

18
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,544
Attention!

19
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,304
- More potatoes, Mr. Miyagi?
- No, thank you, Louisa-san.

20
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,781
Miyagi is rice man, remember?

21
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,951
I am so sorry that my granddaughter's
not here to meet you.

22
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,256
I don't know where she can be.

23
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,528
Julie! This is Mr. Miyagi.
He was a friend of your grandfather.

24
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,405
Hi.

25
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,408
Please excuse me for a moment.

26
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:46,048
Julie, I want you to come out
and meet Mr. Miyagi.

27
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,316
- I did. I said ``hi.``
- I want you to talk to him.

28
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,981
You invited him here.
You talk to him.

29
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,048
- What are you doing?
- Getting some meat.

30
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,060
- Why?
- It's for a friend.

31
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,460
May I ask which friend?

32
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,694
Why is it, whenever I come back here,
I feel like I'm in a police station.

33
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,565
I'm surprised you don't take
my fingerprints.

34
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,436
I worry about you, that's all.
You've got to tell me what you want.

35
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,305
What I want is for you
to leave me alone!

36
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,640
Where are you going?
Susan!

37
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,116
My name is Julie.
My mother's name was Susan.

38
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:22,552
She was killed in a car accident
with my father, and they're both dead.

39
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,817
So stop trying to bring them back.

40
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:35,126
I'm sorry you had to see that.
She is always so very angry.

41
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,499
Anybody who lose parent...

42
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,002
have much grief.

43
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:46,171
Grief trapped in the heart
become big anger.

44
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,214
I don't know what to do anymore.

45
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,216
Have suggestion.

46
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,988
Suggest Louisa-san...

47
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,361
water flowers.

48
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,331
What do you mean, flowers?

49
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,871
Not here flower.

50
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,807
Flower in Miyagi garden.
California.

51
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,364
Hi, Angel.

52
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,699
Hi.

53
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,269
How you doing, huh?

54
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,277
How's your wing?
Does it feel any better?

55
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,816
Come here. Can you come to me?
Come here, hop to my hand.

56
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,376
Good girl.
Let's go for a walk, okay?

57
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,047
Come on.

58
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,824
I got in another argument
with my grandmother tonight.

59
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,330
I wish my parents were still here.

60
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,028
Everything wouldn't be
so messed up.

61
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,034
You know...

62
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:01,136
if they found out you were here,
they'd take you away.

63
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:05,514
Wouldn't that be awful?
In some small cage.

64
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,678
You wouldn't know anybody.

65
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,853
- 544<i>, handle code two.</i>
- We're checking it out.

66
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,962
Larry, look at that,
up on the roof.

67
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,636
If she hasn't jumped yet,
I'm gonna throw her.

68
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,144
I'll be back.
You be quiet, okay?

69
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,804
You be quiet.

70
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,053
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

71
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,526
- You think she's still up here?
- Beats me.

72
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,867
- What was that?
- Look out!

73
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,871
You! Hold it right there!

74
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,374
I said hold it!
Police!

75
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,326
Stop!

76
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,330
Oh, come on!

77
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,645
Look, I've heard all this before.

78
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,378
Why don't you put it on a video so I can
fast-forward through the familiar parts?

79
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:50,821
I love you,Julie,
and I know you love me.

80
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,792
But these days,
we act as if we hate each other.

81
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,263
Talking doesn't seem to help.
It just makes things worse.

82
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:03,701
Mr. Miyagi's invited me to spend
some time at his house in California.

83
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,966
He'll stay here and take care of
everything while I'm gone.

84
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:22,353
<i>This zone is for the immediate loading</i>
<i>and unloading of passengers only.</i>

85
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,082
<i>No parking.</i>

86
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,717
<i>Please do not leave</i>
<i>any baggage unattended.</i>

87
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,988
- Skycap! Here.
- Yes, sir?

88
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,963
I've tried sometimes...

89
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,973
Just to talk to you
and not get angry...

90
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,566
but everything gets messed up,
and I don't know why.

91
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,445
Things get messed up for me too.

92
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,817
Bye.

93
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,423
Grandmother barely on plane...

94
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,429
miss you already.

95
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,096
My birthday's in a couple of weeks.
I guess she forgot.

96
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,160
Birthday.

97
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:16,732
Very special day.
Everybody have birthday.

98
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:21,269
Miyagi make you
special dinner, okay?

99
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,807
Tempura. Tempura, sukiyaki.
You like?

100
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,820
No like. Okay.

101
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,187
Sushi.
Sushi, sashimi. Huh?

102
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,658
Sashimi. No. Okay.

103
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:40,563
Miyagi have it.
Hamburger teriyaki with French fry.

104
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:46,238
Look, I don't need a special dinner.
I can take care of myself.

105
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,741
- I know where I'm going.
- Good.

106
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,247
Miyagi know where you're going too.
Going school.

107
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,689
Miyagi pick you up here this afternoon.
Okay,Julie-san?

108
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,237
Hey, get to class.
Get going.

109
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,907
Get to class.
Let's go.

110
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:15,989
Morning,Julie. No, no, no.
Those are bad for your ears.

111
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,460
Go to hell, Ned.

112
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,631
Now, I could take you down
to the principal's office...

113
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,724
and get you into a little trouble.

114
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,932
Or, I could pick you up tomorrow night
and take you down to the docks.

115
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,840
You've been to the docks, haven't you,
Julie? Pretty girl like you.

116
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,673
Dream on.

117
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:38,274
Hey! Most girls in this school
invite me.

118
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,114
Now, you're lucky
to get an invitation.

119
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,122
Now, come on,Julie.
You know it's going to happen.

120
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,782
Let go of me!

121
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,383
Start hanging out
with me and my friends...

122
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,588
you can have any damn thing
that you want.

123
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,825
- Let go of me.
- What's going on, Ned?

124
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,197
Colonel Dugan, sir.

125
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,463
I caught this young lady
smoking cigarettes.

126
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,698
What are you talking about?
I wasn't smoking.

127
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,641
Her name is Julie Pierce, sir.

128
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,906
To the office. Let's go.

129
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,915
Curb your dog.

130
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:12,418
A member of the Alpha Elite caught
this student smoking in the greenhouse.

131
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:17,014
A member of the Alpha Elite caught
this student smoking in the greenhouse.

132
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,717
Put her record
in the center file.

133
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:24,126
If this student screws up again,
I want her out of here.

134
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,996
Of course, it depends
on which rule she breaks.

135
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,370
No second chances.
Next time, that's it.

136
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,508
- I agree.
- All right, young lady...

137
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,512
you've been warned.

138
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,209
Now get to your next class.

139
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,946
It's a big school.
I might get lost on the way.

140
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,354
McGowen, take this student
to her next class. Room 238.

141
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,731
Hey, I'm Eric.
What's your name?

142
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,960
Go to hell.

143
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,801
``Go to hell.`` That's a funny name.
Is it Chinese?

144
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:10,899
Don't strain yourself. You're just
another jerk working for Colonel Dugan.

145
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,911
So, you got a problem with that?

146
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,413
Hang out with morons,
and you catch their stupidity.

147
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,043
The Alpha Elite--
it's like a championship football team.

148
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,381
That's what this school's known for.

149
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:25,355
Right.
And you believe everything you hear?

150
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,517
I don't believe your name is
``go to hell.``

151
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,029
See you later.

152
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,518
- McGowen, right?
- Yeah.

153
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:58,113
Colonel Dugan told me you took
Julie Pierce to her next class.

154
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,818
- Any problems?
- No.

155
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,827
No? Good.

156
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,655
Don't forget, she's mine.

157
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,806
Anybody home?

158
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,893
It's okay. It's okay.

159
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:50,202
How's the wing, huh?
Does it feel any better?

160
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,211
Don't worry.

161
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,484
- What are you doing up here?
- Where'd you get the hawk?

162
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:03,112
She got shot in the wing.
I found her on the grass near the gym.

163
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,815
- Does it bite?
- Yeah.

164
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,358
Yeah, so stay back.

165
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,199
So, what is this place?

166
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,360
One of the janitors
used to keep pigeons up here.

167
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,930
Yeah? It's pretty cool.
You got your own private little zoo.

168
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,374
- This is my secret, all right?
- Well, not anymore.

169
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,477
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean? What do I mean?

170
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,576
You tell anybody about this,
and you're gonna be in trouble.

171
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,419
- What kind of trouble?
- Well, I'll--

172
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,424
- I'll call Domino's Pizza.
- Yeah?

173
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,983
I'll have them deliver 48 pizzas
in the middle of the night.

174
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,088
That's great. I love pizza.
No anchovies, okay?

175
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,599
I'll write your name
all over the girls' bathroom.

176
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,567
I'll tell everyone you have
some weird social disease.

177
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,073
I guess I'm gonna be
pretty popular then, huh?

178
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,276
- You have a car?
- Yeah.

179
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,869
How would you like a pound of sugar
poured down the gas tank?

180
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,381
- You're kinda angry, aren't you?
- Yes!

181
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,216
- I like that.
- What are you gonna do about Angel?

182
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,717
So, what are you gonna do?

183
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,088
You'll see.

184
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,690
In the past,
we've had external enemies.

185
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,896
Now the enemy is in our country.

186
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,430
It's inside our cities,
in our schools.

187
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:33,808
In a war, you have to be
ready and able to destroy your enemy.

188
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,371
Your school is clean and orderly...

189
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,783
because you are ready and able
to give a maximum response.

190
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,551
Some punk brings spray paint,
puts graffiti on our walls...

191
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,787
we spray paint his eyeballs
so that he sees red.

192
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,955
Some kid drops a candy wrapper...

193
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,225
you make him pick it up and eat it.

194
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,063
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir!

195
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,368
Are you ready and able to give
a maximum response?

196
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,931
A maximum effort?
To go to the limit?

197
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,167
All right.

198
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:11,842
Now, this is a bullring,
and I am the bull.

199
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,818
My objective is to defend.

200
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:18,379
Your objective is to attack...

201
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,084
so take your best shot.

202
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,457
Does that mean anything goes,
Colonel Dugan?

203
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,860
Try whatever you'd like.

204
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,502
I got him. Hit him.

205
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,651
- Very good, Ned.
- Sir!

206
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,889
Where is McGowen?

207
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,630
McGowen, get out here.

208
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,199
You have a problem?

209
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,465
No, I don't. I'll fight for my family,
I'll fight for myself...

210
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,205
but I'm not gonna step in there just
so you can show me how tough you are.

211
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,544
Maybe you should fight
out of anger then.

212
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,320
Yes!
Now that's more like it.

213
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,320
That's what I like to see.

214
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,222
Get back.

215
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,432
I guess that made you feel
like a man, huh?

216
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,662
Did you feel pretty good?

217
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,070
When the enemy is weakest,
that's when you destroy them.

218
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,371
Excuse me.

219
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,880
Looking for student
named Julie Pierce.

220
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,074
Who the hell are you?

221
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,948
My name Miyagi.
Friend of student grandmother.

222
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,585
I don't care if you're a friend
of the pope.

223
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,594
You're trespassing.

224
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:06,529
Now get your butt off school property.

225
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,002
- Boy, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

226
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,439
What are you all gawking at?
Let's do some laps. Come on!

227
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,583
I told you to leave.

228
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,419
Do you have a problem
with your hearing?

229
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,152
No, hearing okay.

230
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,559
Then it must a problem with this
old body of yours getting rickety.

231
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:42,498
- You don't move very fast.
- Move fast enough when necessary.

232
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,262
I told you to leave.

233
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:49,273
Miyagi raised in small village...

234
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,071
on Okinawa.

235
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,112
At that time...

236
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,511
was a very bad-tempered bull...

237
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,072
live in a pasture near village.

238
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,143
Bull very bad. He chase children...

239
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,451
woman going shopping,
farmer, everybody.

240
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,927
Then, one day, big festival.

241
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,020
Everybody happy.

242
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,762
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

243
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:28,880
That day,
bad bull become good soup.

244
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,115
-Did you tell Dugan about the hawk?
-You stayed after school to ask me that?

245
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,854
If anyone finds out about Angel,
they're gonna take her away.

246
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,259
Is that what you call her-- Angel?

247
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,856
- How do you know she's a girl?
- Will you just answer the question?

248
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,662
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

249
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:54,331
Well, I'm not getting out of this car
until you tell me what you're gonna do.

250
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,271
Fine. Have it your way.

251
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,168
Do you like my car?

252
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:05,148
It's an Oldsmobile 442.
I saved it from the junkyard.

253
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,984
- It's just a car.
- ``It's just a car``?

254
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,683
Does MichaelJordan
Just play basketball?

255
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,692
Is Wayne Gretzky
Just a hockey player?

256
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,284
I don't know. Is he?

257
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:20,127
No, he's not.
He's great, like this car.

258
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,168
- Where are you going?
- To work.

259
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:34,835
- You're a train driver?
- Security.

260
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:39,077
- A security guard?
- Yeah, that's right.

261
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,609
You know, my grandfather, he used
to be an engineer in this train yard.

262
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,123
I just chase the rats.
Come here, I wanna show you something.

263
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,731
From up here you could see
the top of the world.

264
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,734
Come on up.

265
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,449
Why do you do this?

266
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,980
Well, for the money.
What else?

267
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,053
My dad walked out on us
about six years ago.

268
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,255
For a while he was sending us money,
but then he just stopped.

269
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,423
So, I had to get a job.

270
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:33,501
I don't know, I guess he didn't think
we were very important.

271
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,467
It doesn't matter though.
This is temporary.

272
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:44,447
I'm going to the Air Force Academy.
I'm gonna be a fighter pilot.

273
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,507
Dugan said I can get in.

274
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,281
That's why you joined his group?

275
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,447
Yeah.

276
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,014
Yep, it's a pain in the ass...

277
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,822
but, hey, it'll get me
in the cockpit of an F-1 5.

278
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,888
I never think about the future.

279
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:05,596
Sure you do.
What are you doing next month?

280
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,230
Don't know.

281
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,241
- What are you doing next week?
- Don't care.

282
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,676
What are you doing
in the next five seconds?

283
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,714
I'm gonna make you promise me...

284
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,545
that you won't tell anybody
about the hawk.

285
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,052
- Don't worry.
- Promise.

286
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,389
- Look, if it's that important to you--
- Promise!

287
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,452
All right.

288
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,988
I promise.

289
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:41,439
Talk to you again soon.
Bye-bye.

290
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,106
Julie-san, hello.

291
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,979
So, how was school today?

292
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,986
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

293
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,785
You're supposed to knock
before you come into a girl's room!

294
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,383
Very, very sorry.
Miyagi apologize.

295
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,360
Very sorry. Oh, very sorry.

296
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,164
Okay, I'm dressed.
You can look now.

297
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,868
Miyagi apologize.
You see...

298
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,880
before, live with friend, Daniel-san.

299
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,042
Daniel-san come Miyagi room,
Miyagi go Daniel-san room.

300
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:30,247
No big thing.
A boy is easier.

301
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,257
-Just forget about it, okay?
- Okay.

302
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:38,024
Today, Miyagi go pick upJulie-san
at the school...

303
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,690
but you not there.

304
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,892
I went to the train yard
to talk to this guy.

305
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:46,096
- No big deal.
- Miyagi also talk to people--

306
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,934
your teachers.

307
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,941
Bring home homework you miss
for three weeks.

308
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,172
Great.
Maybe I'll do it sometime.

309
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,114
Maybe do it tonight.

310
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,350
Don't order me around.

311
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,876
Is not order.
Is very small request.

312
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,788
I told you this morning,
I know where I'm going in my life...

313
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,053
and I don't need any math problems
to get there.

314
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,625
Ambition without the knowledge...

315
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,568
is like boat on dry land.

316
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,570
Forget it, I'm outta here!

317
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,948
Will you just stay out of my life?
Stop telling me what to do!

318
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,184
Not trying to tell you nothing.
Try teach you something.

319
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,385
Teach me? Look at you!
You can't even speak English.

320
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,963
- Wow, I'm really sorry. Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

321
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,977
Are you okay?
I'm really sorry.

322
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,240
She came out of nowhere, man.
I didn't even see her.

323
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,110
- You're not hurt?
- I said I was okay!

324
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,151
Hey, look, I'm really sorry!
Listen, man, I'm really sorry.

325
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,779
I just gotta deliver this pizza down
the road. My boss has been on my case.

326
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,154
And I've been having trouble
with my-- I gotta go! I'm sorry!

327
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:18,662
Are you sure you're okay?
I gotta go! I'm really sorry!

328
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,604
Go ahead.
Do what my grandmother does.

329
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,140
Tell me I made another mistake.

330
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,666
``Julie, you're so thoughtless.
Julie, you lost your temper again.``

331
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,382
Julie-san, Miyagi no need say nothing.

332
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,283
You're doing very nice job,
thank you.

333
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,377
You're not gonna say anything?

334
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,118
Have small question.
Where you learn that?

335
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,592
Learn what?

336
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:53,358
Jump into tiger position
when car almost hit you.

337
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,797
They no teach that kind of stuff
girl's gym.

338
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,794
I don't know what you're talking about.

339
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,304
I just reacted.

340
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:28,632
My father taught me karate
when I was a little girl.

341
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,268
We used to do it every night
after school.

342
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,738
I thought it was a game.

343
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,901
Your grandpapa...

344
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,946
save Miyagi life...

345
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,947
long time ago.

346
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,384
Was wartime.

347
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:53,622
So, Miyagi try to say thank you...

348
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,784
teach him karate.

349
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,795
He love karate.

350
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,258
He teach your father.

351
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,768
Your father teach you.

352
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,107
And then they died.

353
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,609
Everybody died.

354
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,172
Miyagi understand.

355
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,842
Miyagi also have parents
at one time.

356
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,381
Anger no bring them back.

357
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,659
My mother was a beautiful woman.

358
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,632
Whenever I watched her get dressed
for a party...

359
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,568
I thought she looked
like a magical princess.

360
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,128
My father loved her.

361
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:46,644
He was wise and funny and kind.

362
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,149
It wasn't right
that they were killed.

363
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,280
It wasn't fair.

364
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,690
Death not fair to anyone...

365
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:06,458
but still
we must live our lives.

366
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,989
I used to see them
so bright in my mind...

367
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,002
so clear.

368
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,538
Now all I have
are these photographs.

369
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:21,207
Julie-san, parents leave you...

370
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,941
more than just the photographs.

371
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:27,109
Leave you
with very valuable legacy.

372
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:31,445
- What legacy?
- Karate.

373
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,053
What's so special about that?

374
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,495
Karate here.

375
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:46,497
But, this time,
you too young to understand...

376
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,835
true value of karate.

377
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:53,877
For once, I wish you could give me
an answer I could understand.

378
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,578
Answer only important...

379
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,585
when ask right question.

380
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,890
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

381
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,775
How come my makeup's
all over the bathroom?

382
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,786
Too much makeup.

383
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,617
What?

384
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,625
Bathroom have too much makeup.

385
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,684
What do you mean,
``too much makeup``?

386
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,696
There's no such thing
as too much makeup.

387
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,562
Julie-san,
it become problem when--

388
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,000
The problem is my teeth.

389
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,766
I just realized.
They don't match my nose.

390
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:00,107
Teeth fine, nose fine.

391
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,772
Everything fit just fine.

392
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:09,076
I've been thinking about
this karate stuff my dad taught me.

393
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,280
Do you think I could still do it?
I'm not real strong.

394
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,483
Many kind of strength,Julie-san.

395
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,016
Well, I thought maybe
you could give me a few lessons...

396
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:21,293
so if Dugan's guys try to hassle me,
I could take care of myself.

397
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,995
You want a lesson?
You pay Miyagi.

398
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,663
Pay you? With what? I'm broke.

399
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:34,705
Miyagi take four homework paper
payment one karate lesson.

400
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,771
- No way.
- No way, no teach.

401
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,441
All right.

402
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,277
Two math papers for one lesson.

403
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,414
Two math paper, one history paper.

404
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,960
Okay. Deal.

405
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,029
Let's start right now.

406
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,362
Good.
First, we wax the car.

407
00:33:56,434 --> 00:34:00,370
This hand wax on,
this hand wax off. See?

408
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,339
Forget it.
I'm not waxing anybody's car.

409
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:07,071
But first we wax car,
then we work engine.

410
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,581
This new kind karate.
Very much fun.

411
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,639
Fun? The mall is fun.

412
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,345
You have money for gasoline go mall?

413
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,911
I told you, I'm broke.

414
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,980
Then no need go mall.

415
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,994
You know what? I don't think
you know anything about girls.

416
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,896
Miyagi have much to learn
about girls.

417
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,071
Boys easier.

418
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,981
I still want to go to the mall.

419
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:56,516
But I thought maybe
you could loan me some money.

420
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,824
No need loan money.

421
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:02,195
Family across street have
three young boys need baby-sitter.

422
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,702
Miyagi told them
you'd be very happy take job.

423
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,777
Hi, I'm Julie.

424
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,376
Yes!

425
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:30,820
- What are you doing here?
- Miyagi figure...

426
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,797
children no have enough toys,
so bring more.

427
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,996
Nerf balls, flying disk.

428
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,561
All kind good stuff.
You just have fun.

429
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,097
`` Have fun``? Mr. Miyagi,
they don't need any more toys.

430
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,576
They need three
child-sized straightjackets.

431
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,713
Sun is warm, grass is green.

432
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:52,976
What?

433
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:57,043
If todayJulie-san get angry...

434
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,521
Just you repeat those words.

435
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,855
Take deep breath in
through nose.

436
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,157
Sun is warm, grass is green.

437
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,958
Everything work out.

438
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:18,241
The sun is warm,
the grass is green.

439
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,243
Get her! Get her!
Come on!

440
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,155
Come on! Come on!

441
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,561
- Move! Go!
- Got ya!

442
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,764
Let's get outta here!

443
00:36:56,781 --> 00:37:00,148
You planned that whole thing.

444
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:05,155
Baby-sitting sometime good exercise
for karate student,Julie-san.

445
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,159
Well, when do I learn how to break
boards and stuff like that?

446
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:16,361
Why break boards?
What boards do to you?

447
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:21,371
That kind stuff no teach you
how to conquer anger,Julie-san.

448
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,873
- Understand?
- Yeah.

449
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,721
Julie Pierce-- I knew it.
Cops said it was a girl. Let's go.

450
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:27,403
Julie, what's going on?
Looking for an education?

451
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,735
- Surprise.
- Where you going,Julie?

452
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,840
-Maybe she left something in her locker.
-Let go of me!

453
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,517
She's feisty, feisty.

454
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,650
Get her!

455
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,771
There's no way out,Julie!

456
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,038
I know you're in here,Julie.

457
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,121
Come on,Julie.
I'm not that bad.

458
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,222
Let's just talk.

459
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,730
Let's try to be friends,Julie.

460
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,830
I hope I didn't scare you,Julie.

461
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,841
I didn't mean to.

462
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,448
I just want to see if we can
work out some of our differences.

463
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:54,116
I really don't like McGowen.

464
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,924
I thought maybe we can...

465
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,931
talk about that a little bit.

466
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,931
You should have let me take you to--

467
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,066
You're real pretty in the moonlight,
but this is nice.

468
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,399
Get off!.

469
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:46,239
Sometimes I like it different.
Where you going,Julie?

470
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,641
Get her, will you?

471
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,263
Come on, guys, move it!

472
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,531
Don't let her
out of this courtyard!

473
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,037
- Here we come,Julie!
- Get her!

474
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,275
Don't let her go!
Open the door!

475
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,748
I'll see you at the docks.
Don't forget, we have a date.

476
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,859
Officer, I'm so glad you're here.

477
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:52,733
S<i>o what you doing at school</i>
<i>this hour,Julie-san</i>--<i>studying?</i>

478
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,912
I was trying to feed Angel.

479
00:41:56,981 --> 00:42:01,782
Angel.
Rather you act like angel.

480
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,786
Angel's a hawk, Mr. Miyagi.

481
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,147
- Hawk?
- Yes.

482
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,419
It's a long story.

483
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,485
Miyagi ready to listen
to long story.

484
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,497
Get in car, please.

485
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,564
You're mad at me, aren't you?

486
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:31,747
Julie-san, try to protect hawk
is okay, good.

487
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,409
But should have told Miyagi.

488
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:41,981
Dugan talked with the principal. They
kicked me out of school for two weeks.

489
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,051
Now I'll never catch up
with my classes.

490
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,565
Maybe I should just
forget about school...

491
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,499
forget about my life.

492
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,061
Why can't I just lock myself in my room
and listen to music all day?

493
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,664
No, please.

494
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,834
Too hard on Miyagi ear.

495
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,243
Have better idea.

496
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,839
Tomorrow we go special place.

497
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:11,011
Go visit longtime Miyagi friend.

498
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,157
- Hi, Eric.
- What are you doing here?

499
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:19,662
Something happened at school,
and I got suspended for a little while.

500
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,360
We're going out of town for a couple
weeks. Can you feed the hawk for me?

501
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,164
What'd you get suspended for?

502
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:30,502
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.
Can you feed the hawk?

503
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,064
Yeah, no problem.

504
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:35,873
Good. It's raw meat every other day
and keep the water bottle filled.

505
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,346
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

506
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,076
You gonna miss me?

507
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,079
Maybe.

508
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:47,851
Maybe? I'm not accepting
any maybes today.

509
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,187
Eric, watch out.

510
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,227
I want an answer.
You gonna miss me?

511
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,526
- Not if you break your leg.
- That's not the answer I want.

512
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,631
I want an answer.

513
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,796
- Yes.
- What?

514
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,871
Yes, I'll miss you.

515
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,042
Bye.

516
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:41,342
Julie-san, you get five gallon
unleaded regular...

517
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:44,939
and some chocolate bar with almonds.

518
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,448
Right.

519
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,523
- Hi.
- How are you?

520
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:58,493
Can I get five gallons of gas and some
chocolate bars with almonds, please?

521
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,705
- Ted, what are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

522
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,348
Hello, dog.

523
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,326
Nice puppy.

524
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,092
Very nice dog.

525
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,898
How'd you do that, Mr. Miyagi?
That dog was about to attack me.

526
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:44,873
- Anything possible if not afraid.
- I wish I had your courage.

527
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,410
- Wish I had chocolate bar with almond.
- I got 'em.

528
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:51,574
What the hell you think you're doing?
Look at my dog.

529
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,146
You turned him into a damn chicken.

530
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,383
Sometime animal have more sense
than human.

531
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,856
Yeah?
Well, you watch your mouth, old man.

532
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:06,385
- Come on, let's just get outta here.
- You ain't going till I say so.

533
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,897
Hey, let girl go.

534
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:14,431
- Watch it, Ted.
- What are you gonna do, old man? Fight?

535
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,405
Fighting not good.

536
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,826
Fighting not good.
Somebody always get hurt.

537
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,299
Right. I totally agree.

538
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,737
That was great, Mr. Miyagi.

539
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,041
No, not great.

540
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:55,044
Miyagi always look for way
not to fight.

541
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:59,310
Miyagi hate fighting.
Was most unfortunate.

542
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:03,217
`` Unfortunate``? Come on. Aren't you glad
you kicked some guy's butt?

543
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,814
Not want to kick anything.

544
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:12,328
Was most unfortunate their butts
attached to small brain.

545
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,444
Now what?

546
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,572
Now we wait.

547
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,309
Sorry. Sorry.

548
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,983
There's this loud bong going off,
and I couldn't sleep any longer.

549
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:55,025
So I thought we'd get
some breakfast.

550
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,597
Earth to Miyagi.

551
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,735
Come in, Mr. Miyagi.

552
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,476
Good morning,Julie-san.

553
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:23,091
Rock garden is very sacred place.

554
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,594
Is example of inner peace.

555
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,661
Sand represent ocean.

556
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,826
Big rock,Japan.

557
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,628
Small rock, Okinawa...

558
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:38,266
- where Miyagi born.
- So?

559
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,435
So, go visitJapan.

560
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,570
- What?
- Hurry up. Get on big rock.

561
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,877
All right, I'm on Japan.

562
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,887
Think I could buy a TV set
while I'm here?

563
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,549
No, no, no. No TV set.

564
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:59,493
First, you fake front kick
at opponent.

565
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:05,001
Roll hip, come around, make round kick,
land on Okinawa.

566
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,662
- That sounds hard.
- Try.

567
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:21,951
That's impossible.

568
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:26,854
Anything try first time impossible,
but must try. Do again.

569
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,483
Is there a trick to this--
something I haven't figured out?

570
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,619
- Pray.
- Pray?

571
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:37,600
Great. Wonderful.
That's a big help.

572
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,613
Very good,Julie-san.
Try again.

573
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,489
When little girl growing up...

574
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,549
parents always say,
`` Be good...

575
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:06,994
wear pretty dress, no fight.``

576
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,760
Then, when same girl grow up...

577
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:14,202
when in time in dangerous situation,
she hesitate.

578
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:18,503
Oh? So when is it okay?
I mean, how do you know when to f--

579
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:23,137
When you have full respect for self...

580
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,478
respect for others,
that answer come.

581
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:34,088
What are we supposed to do here?
Pitch some hay?

582
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,920
Julie-san must learn be alert.

583
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:41,862
Must know all times
where is trouble.

584
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:46,832
- All right, I'm alert.
- Open eyes.

585
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:50,236
My eyes are already open.
What am I supposed to do?

586
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,077
Focus,Julie-san.

587
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,211
Boy, am I hungry.
I could eat a big juicy--

588
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,475
What?

589
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,280
What?

590
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,327
What's the problem?

591
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,333
What'd I do wrong?

592
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:29,234
Julie-san try to kill cockroach.

593
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:33,640
What? Like you've never tried
to kill a cockroach before?

594
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,736
Monks here believe...

595
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:40,749
negative action cause
suffering and pain.

596
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:48,181
So, therefore,
within monastery walls...

597
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,818
nothing is ever killed.

598
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,828
Well, that's a stupid rule.

599
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,304
Where you going?

600
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,813
Is stupid when neighborhood gangs...

601
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,906
kill each other with no reason.

602
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:22,721
Is stupid when countries fight wars.

603
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:28,998
Not stupid to respect
all living things.

604
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,930
Yeah, I bet you've killed a cockroach.

605
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:38,272
Miyagi don't live in monastery,
Julie-san...

606
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:42,778
but still respect all living things.

607
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,345
Attention!

608
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,349
By the time I'd left the army...

609
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:58,292
I had learned one thing:

610
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:01,853
When you go into battle,
you must be strong.

611
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,421
Eric McGowen?

612
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,298
- Yeah.
- Eyes forward.

613
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:07,802
Your mother's on the phone.

614
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:12,800
You're not finished here.
You don't leave here until I say so.

615
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,674
You leave here, and you can forget
about that recommendation...

616
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,944
to the Air Force Academy.

617
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:26,478
That'll be it for you. You'll end up
flipping burgers the rest of your life.

618
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,821
- Mom, what's wrong?
- <i>Eric, it's me,Julie.</i>

619
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,265
Julie. What's going on?

620
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:42,032
Sorry I had to call you at school,
but the place I'm at has no phone.

621
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,834
I wanted to make sure Angel's okay.

622
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:48,399
She's lonely.
I think she misses you.

623
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:51,311
I hope this phony call
doesn't get you in trouble.

624
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:55,841
- So when are you coming back?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

625
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,853
Well, you better make it soon, okay?

626
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,650
See ya.

627
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:19,258
I'm sorry I tried to kill
the cockroach. Look.

628
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,003
Good.

629
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:50,021
This time I'm not
gonna get taken by surprise.

630
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,493
That very good to hear,Julie-san.

631
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:56,498
You're in here.
I know you are.

632
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:01,466
- Feel alert,Julie-san?
- Totally.

633
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:05,269
- Ready to defend self?
- No problem.

634
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,933
Good.

635
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:10,008
Then do with blindfold.

636
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,776
Come on. How can I block an attack
if I can't see?

637
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:22,756
Then you use ear, nose, skin, feet.

638
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:26,454
Learn to use all senses.

639
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:41,169
I did it! I was focused!
Totally focused!

640
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,886
Must open senses wider,Julie-san.

641
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,912
I'm really sorry.
I thought you guys were asleep.

642
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,419
I'm outta here.
I'll get outta here right away.

643
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:09,326
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mr. Miyagi.

644
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,569
What's going on?

645
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:18,970
Nothing.

646
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,510
Just monks having good time.

647
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,974
I thought they were supposed to be
spiritual leaders.

648
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:31,987
Never trust spiritual leader
who cannot dance.

649
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:03,442
Mr. Miyagi, I can't do this.
I've tried a thousand times.

650
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,216
You remember what I say
first time we do this?

651
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,484
Pray?

652
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:13,860
Praying mantis always
drop to one knee before strike.

653
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,310
Yes! Yes!

654
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:44,250
I did it! I did it! Yes!

655
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,260
Congratulations,Julie-san.

656
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:56,294
``Congratulations``? That's all
you're gonna say, is congratulations?

657
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:59,432
- Don't I get a belt or something?
- Buy belt mall.

658
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:04,040
I mean a karate belt--
brown belt, black belt.

659
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,344
- Why need belt?
- So everyone knows I'm good.

660
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:11,113
You know you good.
That the important thing.

661
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:14,520
Come on.
Even Elvis Presley got a black belt.

662
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,218
Borrow from Elvis
next time see him.

663
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:23,020
Wax on, wax off.

664
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,727
Very good,Julie-san.

665
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,471
Miss spot.

666
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:54,525
This called footwork kata.

667
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,536
Footwork, footwork, footwork!
That's it!

668
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,446
One more time! Whoa! Boom!

669
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:31,863
Tomorrow we go home.

670
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,868
Time go back school.

671
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:36,598
Yeah, I know.

672
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:41,132
I wish the monks had had dinner with us.
I would have liked to say ``good-bye.``

673
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:52,481
Monks discover something
aboutJulie-san.

674
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:59,094
Think they like tell you something.
Come.

675
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:03,994
Okay, I confess. I killed a spider
in my bedroom, but it was an accident.

676
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,330
I even buried him
and said a little prayer.

677
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:17,002
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

678
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:25,947
<i>Happy birthday, dearJulie-san</i>

679
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:30,823
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
- This is great.

680
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:33,885
It's the first cake
I'm ever gonna eat with chopsticks.

681
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:36,692
Blow candle, make wish.

682
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,996
Maybe you get it.

683
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,736
Monks agree...

684
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:54,613
to giveJulie-san one wish
and one gift.

685
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:59,620
Well, my one wish was that you guys
would come visit us in Boston.

686
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:03,154
This is difficult.

687
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:07,525
We have not left monastery
for many years.

688
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,396
Wish granted.

689
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:20,636
Now receive gift.

690
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:32,250
Your gift is demonstration
of Zen archery.

691
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,654
So, where's the target?

692
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,761
You're looking at it.

693
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,494
Excuse me?

694
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,898
Abbot will shoot one arrow--

695
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:48,334
not for points.

696
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,498
If master small thing...

697
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:54,168
anything become possible.

698
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:58,177
Miyagi volunteer for this honor.

699
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,366
Thanks for the arrow.

700
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,852
Hi,Julie!

701
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,631
Good morning,Julie.
Welcome back.

702
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,227
Good morning, Mr. Wilkes.
Listen, I'm sorry about what happened.

703
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,101
Well, I guess
you learned something.

704
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:33,232
Ambition without knowledge is like
a boat on dry land.

705
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,709
I don't quite understand
your answer.

706
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:39,009
The answer's only important
if you ask the right question.

707
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:45,643
- Hi, Eric.
- How you doing?

708
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,154
Great. How are you?

709
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,657
Just fine. Welcome back.

710
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:51,158
Thanks.

711
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:55,792
So, tell me--
where did you go?

712
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:59,626
I can't tell you.

713
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,899
- What do you mean, you can't tell me?
- You'd never believe me.

714
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,031
Hey, I haven't been up
to see Angel yet. How is she?

715
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:06,802
- She's fine. She's doing good.
- Is she?

716
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:08,275
- Yeah. We're best friends.
- Really?

717
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,244
- You want some milk?
- Thanks.

718
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:13,881
Look who's back in school.

719
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:18,852
Looks like Ned and his friends
are still mad at me.

720
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:22,354
Yeah, well, you're not the only one
they're mad at.

721
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,556
- I quit Dugan's group.
- You what?

722
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,098
Come on.
I'll tell you about it.

723
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:36,528
So, tell me about the Air Force Academy.
I thought Dugan could get you in.

724
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:38,835
I don't need Dugan.
I can do it on my own.

725
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:43,004
He's been giving people orders for
so long, he's got their brains fried.

726
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:45,308
I want to be like Angel.

727
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:46,712
I don't want to be someone--

728
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,752
Where is she?

729
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,913
She was in here yesterday.
I fed her.

730
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,791
She had a broken wing.

731
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,918
- She couldn't fly away.
- I don't know.

732
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,427
What's the matter,Julie?

733
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,829
- Did you lose you little birdie?
- What did you do with her?

734
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,300
The one that can't fly?

735
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,303
It might end up in a Dumpster.

736
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,700
What are you-- a tough guy?

737
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,173
- Tougher than you.
- Stop it, Eric.

738
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:15,676
- Yeah?
- Don't! Eric!

739
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,440
- Where's the hawk?
- I called Animal Control, McGowen.

740
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,448
A man came,
and he put it in a cage.

741
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,483
- Stop it!
- I bet you he's gonna kill it...

742
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,283
and then he's gonna stuff it.

743
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,846
Yeah!

744
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:31,851
- Eric, stop. Will you stop?
- Come on, man!

745
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,723
Stop, Eric.
Forget about him.

746
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:37,197
Oh, I'm not done with you yet,
McGowen.

747
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:39,291
One way or another...

748
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,336
we're gonna finish this thing.

749
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,866
Hi. Hi.

750
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,004
Hi, Angel.
How'd they treat you in there?

751
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:55,206
Angel ready to fly.

752
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:58,447
That's impossible, Mr. Miyagi.
She's got a broken wing.

753
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,154
Take chance.
See what happen.

754
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,124
Nothing's going to happen.

755
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:08,125
Angel decide, notJulie-san.

756
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,225
Come on.

757
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,934
I told you, Mr. Miyagi, she can't
fly away. She has a broken wing.

758
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,274
We don't know that yet.

759
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:45,064
Now, let wind touch bird.

760
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:52,807
Maybe if you believe...

761
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,934
Angel believe too.

762
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,273
Now release.

763
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:08,323
Okay.
Fly away, Angel.

764
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:29,103
What's wrong, Angel?
You're free. Go on. Fly away.

765
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:32,841
Sometimes,
when live in cage too long...

766
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:36,510
whole world seem
like very big place.

767
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,221
You're strong, Angel.

768
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,961
I know you are.

769
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,791
Fly away. Fly free.

770
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,766
You healed her, Mr. Miyagi.

771
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:04,879
No. Angel heal self.

772
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:09,541
But your faith give her
courage to fly.

773
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,789
Come. We go.

774
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:27,697
I'm really going to miss Angel.

775
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:31,228
I used to talk to her a lot.
I told her everything.

776
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:36,442
You lucky
you have Angel talk to.

777
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,537
She no talk back.

778
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:42,509
Maybe now you talk Miyagi...

779
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,518
or your friend, Eric.

780
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,790
He asked me to the senior prom.
I didn't know what to say.

781
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:56,094
What problem?
You no like boy?

782
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,360
Yeah, I like him...

783
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,460
but it's a formal dance,
and I don't have a dress.

784
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,499
Even if I did go,
I probably wouldn't fit in.

785
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:09,442
What would happen if they started doing
an old-fashioned waltz or something?

786
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,445
I don't know how to waltz.

787
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:15,483
All things possible,Julie-san.

788
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:20,478
I have to admit, though,
it was nice to get asked.

789
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:42,640
May I help you, sir?

790
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:44,702
Oh, yes.

791
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:47,442
Want to buy dress.

792
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,984
Formal dance-- very important.

793
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,317
Of course. Well, as you see,
we have all sorts of styles.

794
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:57,620
Do you like an A-line,
or do you like a tea length?

795
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:59,957
Do you like off-the-shoulder?

796
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:03,896
Miyagi like everything,
but dress not for me.

797
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,627
Dress for teenage girl.

798
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:10,468
Of course. Well, what kind
of a girl is she? Is she trendy...

799
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,336
or conservative?

800
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:15,638
We can do a silk charmeuse
or a crepe de chine.

801
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:20,009
Girl have good spinning back kick...

802
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:22,778
but need work
on sword-hand block.

803
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:26,919
Yes, that's very helpful.

804
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:28,422
Is she tall?

805
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:35,052
Not too tall,
but not short.

806
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,530
Not fat.

807
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,464
Not skinny. Slender.

808
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:42,067
Like this.

809
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:53,508
Hi, Mr. Miyagi.

810
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,517
What are you doing?

811
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:02,854
Today we practice karate
inside house.

812
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,252
Here, in the parlor?

813
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,626
Ready?

814
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:11,393
Sure.

815
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:20,130
Today Miyagi show you new kata.

816
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,732
Okay?

817
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:26,747
First, lead with left foot,
right punch.

818
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:28,248
Okay.

819
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:32,014
- Then Julie-san follow.
- Okay.

820
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,423
Side step, punch.

821
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:43,164
Punch, side step.

822
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,199
Feet together.

823
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,566
This time, Miyagi move,
you counter.

824
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:50,764
Go.

825
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:55,976
Feet together.

826
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,142
Side.

827
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:02,481
Once more.

828
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:05,517
Right?

829
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:09,113
- Counter.
- Okay.

830
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,392
Feet together.
Just a minute.

831
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:21,160
Go.

832
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:32,576
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

833
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:42,354
I can't believe it.
I'm dancing.

834
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:45,125
Where'd you learn this?

835
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:49,391
Miyagi invent new kata
called `` Karate Waltz.``

836
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,329
Actually,
Julie-san grandpapa teach.

837
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,701
Was in World War Two, France.

838
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:59,240
He tell Miyagi,
``You can dance.

839
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:02,640
You can fight, you can dance,
you have good footwork.``

840
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:09,081
I still don't know
what I'm going to wear to this thing.

841
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,587
Oh, yes.
Miyagi forget something.

842
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:14,815
You stay, practice.
I be right back.

843
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:35,638
Late birthday present
from Miyagi.

844
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:41,939
Oh, it's beautiful.

845
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:45,110
Miyagi want you to go dance.

846
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:47,280
How'd you know my size?

847
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:50,449
That was very difficult part.

848
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:54,859
It's too bad
you never had a daughter, Mr. Miyagi.

849
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,329
You would have been a good parent.

850
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:58,293
Thank you.

851
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:01,895
One minute.

852
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:12,137
As a new parent,
may I have this dance?

853
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:38,463
So, you call Eric,
you tell him we go dance.

854
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:42,808
What do you mean, ``we``?

855
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:44,812
Miyagi drive car.

856
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:50,212
Mr. Miyagi, it doesn't exactly
work that way.

857
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:56,047
Okay, then Mr. Miyagi stay home,
wait like anxious parent.

858
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:57,557
Okay.

859
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:41,635
Come on.

860
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,609
I'm Eric.
I'm here forJulie Pierce.

861
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:00,706
I'm Eric McGowen.

862
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:04,377
Oh, yes. Honored to meet you.
Miyagi here.

863
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:07,319
I'm taking Julie
to the dance tonight.

864
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:10,256
Oh, yes. Of course...

865
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:14,022
you bring her home by 1 0:00?

866
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:17,121
Well, see,
the dance goes to midnight.

867
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:22,199
So, why don't I bring her back
around 1 :00?

868
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:28,670
What you do for extra hour?

869
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:33,847
Well--

870
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:36,349
Treat her with respect.

871
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,676
Right.

872
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:41,586
Treat her with respect
for one hour.

873
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:44,386
Good.

874
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:50,458
Friend Eric here.

875
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,735
You can come in, Mr. Miyagi.

876
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:15,980
I wish my parents could see this.

877
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:19,226
Oh, parents watching.

878
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:24,354
I still remember what you said to me
at the monastery...

879
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:26,764
about keeping them in my heart.

880
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:33,133
It's a way to love someone
even if they're not with you.

881
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:38,240
Parents very proud...

882
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:40,247
like Miyagi--

883
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:42,249
very happy.

884
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:51,552
Oh,Julie-san,
tonight you are beautiful woman.

885
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:02,867
Go.

886
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,913
Enjoy dance.

887
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:18,617
Maybe Miyagi celebrate too.

888
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:21,246
Take monks for ride on town.

889
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:40,941
See you later, guys.

890
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:50,010
- Who are those people?
- Friends.

891
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:54,681
- I like them.
- I like them too.

892
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,753
That is a nice dress.

893
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,457
You better watch the road, Eric.

894
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:33,961
You know, you look like you,
but you don't look like you.

895
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:39,091
- One way.
- You are so beautiful.

896
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:41,926
It's a one-way street, Eric!

897
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:49,131
Do you really want to do this?

898
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:57,085
`` Boston Bowl``

899
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:58,882
`` Boston Bowl``

900
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:07,089
Don't touch this ball, all right?
This ball cost serious money.

901
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,654
Sorry.
Don't understand English.

902
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:12,222
Look, don't talk either.

903
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:13,892
What the problem?

904
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:17,563
Don't breathe, don't move.
I don't want any distractions.

905
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:21,302
Perhaps we can make
a small contest.

906
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:25,003
Say, buck a point?

907
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:26,671
Just a minute.

908
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,751
Do you believe these guys?
It'll be a piece of cake.

909
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:41,151
Contest covered.

910
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:16,930
Why do they
keep their eyes closed?

911
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:20,800
It's called Zen bowling.

912
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:25,567
No have to see pins,
only have to think about target.

913
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:39,043
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

914
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:46,714
I'm sorry.

915
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:49,685
Sorry for what?

916
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:52,487
For getting you in trouble
with Ned and his friends.

917
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:56,753
You're worth it.

918
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:31,331
Yeah!

919
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:04,223
Look!

920
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:25,418
Help me get him down.

921
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,687
You all right?

922
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,823
- I hit my arm.
- Yeah?

923
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:34,427
Whose idea was this?

924
01:30:35,696 --> 01:30:37,789
Ned's.
Dugan said it would be all right.

925
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:39,196
Leave him alone, McGowen.

926
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,758
This is real smart, Ned.
I think you broke your buddy's arm here.

927
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:44,396
At least he was
brave enough to try it.

928
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:46,099
Why don't you
Just mind your business?

929
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:49,639
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah.

930
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,253
- Those guys are idiots.
- Right here, McGowen.

931
01:31:07,328 --> 01:31:09,853
- Oh, yeah?
- Don't fight.

932
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:13,028
Jerk.

933
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:16,035
McGowen just challenged me.

934
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:18,594
I'm not letting him
get away with this.

935
01:31:18,673 --> 01:31:19,935
Absolutely.

936
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:37,280
None of this would have happened
if it hadn't been for me.

937
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:42,453
What?
What are you talking about?

938
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:44,998
Hey, listen,
I'm glad this happened.

939
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:48,035
Forget about Dugan.
I don't need him.

940
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:51,003
I'm gonna live my life
my way.

941
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:54,166
Sometimes that's difficult.

942
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:57,006
Not when I'm with you.

943
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:09,346
So, Mr. Miyagi is
teaching you karate?

944
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,655
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah?

945
01:32:16,163 --> 01:32:20,293
So, if I try to kiss you,
will you use it?

946
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:24,600
- The sun is warm. The grass is green.
- What?

947
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:28,836
Nothing.

948
01:32:41,255 --> 01:32:42,882
What was that?

949
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:45,323
Let's go, McGowen.

950
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:51,789
Are you all right?

951
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,607
I'll see you at the docks,
McGowen...

952
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:05,544
if you're brave enough to go.

953
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:10,979
- You all right? Look at this.
- Yeah. Let's call the police.

954
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:13,350
Why? What's the point? They're
Just going to lie about what happened.

955
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,651
- What are we going to do?
- We are not doing anything.

956
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:18,283
I'm going to settle this thing
once and for all.

957
01:33:59,834 --> 01:34:03,292
- Where's your little buddies, Ned?
- I didn't think you were gonna show.

958
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:05,066
Yeah?

959
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:07,266
It's one on one.

960
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:09,639
One on one, man.
Now I'm gonna teach you how to fight.

961
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:12,770
You want a piece of me?
Now's the time.

962
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:14,280
Let's go.

963
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:21,621
Remember the bullring, McGowen?

964
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:27,356
As I recall, you didn't think much
of that particular exercise.

965
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:29,589
Maybe now you wish you'd
paid more attention.

966
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,461
I got a piece of you, didn't I?

967
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:35,400
Yes, you did.
Now it's payback time.

968
01:34:36,704 --> 01:34:40,265
Well, son, this time you've
bitten off more than you can chew.

969
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,775
- Let me have him, Ned.
- Not now, Charlie.

970
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:46,108
We're a team.
We're gonna do this together.

971
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:49,081
- Come on. Come on!
- Light it.

972
01:35:01,629 --> 01:35:03,529
Come on, McGowen,
let's go.

973
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:14,636
Come on, Eric.

974
01:35:17,011 --> 01:35:18,273
Pick him up.

975
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:28,553
We haven't even started yet, McGowen.
Come on.

976
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:34,789
You wanted me, McGowen.
You wanted a piece of me, right?

977
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:40,623
- Well, you got it.
- Get up!

978
01:35:44,972 --> 01:35:47,031
You're not that tough.
Come on.

979
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:48,700
Come here! Come here!

980
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:57,514
You're not gonna quit.
Come on, quitter.

981
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:08,021
Oh, come on, McGowen. I thought
you were tougher than that, pal.

982
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:14,228
Higher.
I want to see his eyes.

983
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,701
- Thanks for showing up, McGowen.
- Anytime.

984
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,070
Pick him up.

985
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:25,378
Come here. Come here.

986
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:29,708
Finish him off.

987
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:34,280
What are you all looking at?

988
01:36:34,355 --> 01:36:36,619
What do you think
I've been training you for?

989
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:38,791
Ned, kick him.

990
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:41,919
Do it!

991
01:36:43,831 --> 01:36:46,459
- Dugan, he's down.
- Pick him up!

992
01:36:46,534 --> 01:36:49,731
- Do it.
- Please.

993
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:16,087
What?

994
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,568
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

995
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:24,228
Come. I call police.

996
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:28,241
McGowen was speeding around in his car.
Obviously he had a car accident.

997
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:29,674
That's a lie, man.

998
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:34,146
Is no accident when fight is
five against one.

999
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:37,116
Ned here could have beaten McGowen
with his arms behind his back.

1000
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:39,846
Come. We go.

1001
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,751
Julie-- What?

1002
01:37:41,822 --> 01:37:43,312
What, are you kidding me?

1003
01:37:44,725 --> 01:37:47,489
- Let me fight him.
- You want to fight me?

1004
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:51,531
Julie-san, no fighting.

1005
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:54,830
- Please.
- Colonel, she wants to fight me.

1006
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:59,428
If I'm ever going to respect myself,
I have to do this.

1007
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:03,533
Mr. Miyagi, please tell her
she's gonna get hurt.

1008
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:08,912
Julie-san right.

1009
01:38:09,984 --> 01:38:11,713
Now is time.

1010
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:22,555
Just remember:
True strength come from inside.

1011
01:38:25,799 --> 01:38:27,699
If you're gonna do this...

1012
01:38:27,768 --> 01:38:30,965
you put her away.

1013
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:32,972
Do you understand me?

1014
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:38,634
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

1015
01:38:51,392 --> 01:38:54,259
Guys, this is really embarrassing.

1016
01:38:55,663 --> 01:38:57,927
But okay.

1017
01:38:57,998 --> 01:38:59,590
Give me your best shot.

1018
01:39:15,582 --> 01:39:16,844
Slow down!

1019
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:19,112
Use your strength.

1020
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:36,563
That was really good,Julie.
It really was.

1021
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:41,869
Stop this!

1022
01:39:43,544 --> 01:39:45,239
But it wasn't good enough.

1023
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:46,745
Come on!

1024
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:58,315
Focus,Julie-san.

1025
01:40:27,821 --> 01:40:31,587
All over,Julie-san.
We go.

1026
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:31,792
What are you talking about?

1027
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:33,783
What are you talking about?

1028
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,988
The war is not over
because one battle's lost.

1029
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:40,295
- Charlie'll fight her.
- No, sir.

1030
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:43,302
- Come on, Charlie. I said, fight her!
- No, sir. What are you doing? No!

1031
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:47,029
You're crazy, man.

1032
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:51,802
- Morgan, you fight her.
- Colonel, it's over.

1033
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:56,275
Ned, get up and finish the job.

1034
01:40:57,618 --> 01:41:00,451
I said,
get up and finish the job!

1035
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:02,386
- No more.
- What?

1036
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,620
Enough!

1037
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:07,523
It's not over.

1038
01:41:07,594 --> 01:41:09,858
Then we finish.

1039
01:41:20,841 --> 01:41:22,274
Absolutely.

1040
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:27,213
I'm gonna put your lights out.

1041
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:12,715
Time put your lights out.

1042
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:39,879
You said you had
all the answers, Colonel.

1043
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:56,836
- You were great.
- Not great.

1044
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:04,443
You kicked some butt.

1045
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:10,815
Julie-san, how many times Miyagi say
fighting not good?

1046
01:43:10,884 --> 01:43:13,444
I know.
Somebody always gets hurt.

1047
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:17,915
Mr. Miyagi,
come on, admit it:

1048
01:43:17,991 --> 01:43:19,515
We kicked some butt.

1049
01:43:21,795 --> 01:43:24,025
Fighting not good...

1050
01:43:24,097 --> 01:43:27,931
but if must fight, win.
