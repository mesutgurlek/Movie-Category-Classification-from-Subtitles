l got mad skills,
l will get wild

173
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,624
l got mad skills, l will
get wild

174
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,828
l got mad skills,
l will get wild

175
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,930
l will get wild,
l will get wild...

176
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:21,634
Yeah, l got mascara
and eyeliner left.

177
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,608
You got five blocks.

178
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,738
( sirens blaring )

179
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,840
( tires screeching )

180
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,113
( horns honking )

181
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:36,246
Don't tell me
you're slowing down.

182
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,688
( honking continues )

183
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:39,624
You know, you drive like
an old woman.

184
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,390
Hmm.

185
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,559
You're not scared, are you?

186
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,600
( honking )

187
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,632
( tires screeching )

188
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:58,906
( horns honking )

189
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,515
( tires screeching )

190
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,883
( horns honking )

191
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:13,891
l got mad skills,
l will get wild

192
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,827
l got mad skills, l will
get wild

193
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,557
l will get wild,
l will get wild.

194
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:19,224
( whistle blows )

195
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,096
Hey, you!
What do you think you're doing?

196
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,192
Back off, buddy.

197
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,634
She's mine.

198
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,228
Oh, it's you, miss.

199
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,501
Well, you lived up
to your reputation.

200
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,508
The job is yours.

201
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,237
l have a job. A good one.

202
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:33,211
Oh, yeah? How much do you
make at this ''good job''?

203
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:36,545
$475 a week, plus tips.

204
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:38,880
So how would you like to make
$2,000 a week

205
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,351
plus room and board?

206
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,648
When do l show up?

207
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,679
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.

208
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:46,920
You'll be driving
Clark Devlin, Mr. Tong.

209
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,621
DOORMAN:
Good day, miss.

210
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,993
Now, you!
Out of here!

211
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,361
( birds chirping )

212
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:59,029
STEENA:
Good morning, Mr. Tong.

213
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,233
Huh.

214
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:03,799
You put your face on
without me, huh?

215
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,572
Please have a seat.

216
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,611
Those are the house rules.

217
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,277
Memorize them.

218
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:15,219
Especially number one.

219
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:18,246
''Never talk directly
to Mr. Devlin.''

220
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,417
lf you have any questions

221
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,926
you'll find
all the answers in there.

222
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,021
And, if l were you, l'd get rid
of the mildew on the chin.

223
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:27,589
My soul patch?

224
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,624
Uh, yeah.

225
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,704
You like working
for this Devlin guy?

226
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,640
l don't work for him.

227
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,941
( slow, techno-pop
espionage theme playing )

228
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:53,386
( door shuts )

229
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,594
l'm not a professional driver,
but l'd always believed

230
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,900
that thing you're staring
into is designed

231
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:08,202
for the monitoring of traffic,
not passengers.

232
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:10,300
Am l wrong?

233
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:16,411
While l'm really enjoying
our time together

234
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,542
shall we try moving?

235
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,014
DEVLlN:
Wallace has been my partner
for years.

236
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,185
Something's happened to him.

237
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:28,352
He wouldn't just disappear.

238
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,486
Now, you get yourjob done

239
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:30,496
and find my partner.

240
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,622
MAN ( on phone ):
So tell me how.

241
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,188
You're the head
of an intelligence agency.

242
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:34,256
Why don't you be intelligent?

243
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,961
l don't understand
what you're talking about.

244
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,094
Well, why don't you call me back

245
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:38,728
when you do understand
what l'm talking about.

246
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:43,702
( disco music
plays on speakers )

247
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:45,768
Did we just take
the Balsam Road exit?

248
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:46,779
Of course.

249
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:49,145
You have to take
the surface street.

250
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,041
Sorry.

251
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,018
Did you get a copy
of the rules?

252
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:56,146
Did you read them?

253
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,381
Jimmy, let me tell you
something, my friend...

254
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:03,059
l hate the rules.

255
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,393
Take Grant Boulevard
all the way.

256
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,397
The lights are timed.

257
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:06,898
Thank you.

258
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,901
( speaks Chinese )

259
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:10,425
And, Jimmy...

260
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,438
crank the music up.

261
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:14,099
Yes, sir.

262
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,165
( music blaring )

263
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,771
C.S.A. HEADQUARTERS

264
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:23,077
MAN:
Deputy Director Chalmers,
ladies, gentlemen

265
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:25,983
l present to you
Special Agent Wallace.

266
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:29,146
Deceased two days, 14 hours,
five minutes... approximately.

267
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:30,815
Pretty interesting.

268
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:32,882
Now, why don't you, uh,
tell me a little about him?

269
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:35,917
Well, in simplest terms,
he drowned in his bathtub.

270
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,896
Contusion here suggests
he hit his head

271
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,194
fell prone, unconscious.

272
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,394
The man infiltrated
a Serbian death squad

273
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:43,629
with not even a scratch.

274
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,762
He goes down in a bathtub?

275
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:46,772
Life's a bitch.

276
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:48,103
You want to put him
back in the fridge?

277
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:49,870
WOMAN:
He didn't drown, sir.

278
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:51,934
He was murdered.

279
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:55,675
Does that make life
a little less bitchy?

280
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,580
And-and you would be?

281
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,209
That's Del Blaine, sir.

282
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:00,879
She's having a filter installed

283
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,945
between her brain and mouth
next week.

284
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:05,082
So you don't think he drowned?

285
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:07,456
Well, sir, there was water
in his lungs

286
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:08,858
but the pulmonary vein

287
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,556
was filled with
collapsed platelets

288
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,927
indicative of dehydration.

289
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:14,398
He died of thirst.

290
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,400
Thirst.

291
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:16,662
And it wasn't just
city tap water.

292
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:18,533
The mineral profile fit
a high-end bottled water

293
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:19,799
but what was really weird
is that

294
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,966
it contained a strain
of bacteria that l, so far

295
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,373
haven't been able to culture.

296
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:28,177
Anyway, uh... didn't
mean to interrupt.

297
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:31,342
Ooh, the woman seems to know
a lot about water.

298
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:34,444
Yeah. She thinks she knows
a lot about a lot of things.

299
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,251
You know, we have a special
situation in the field.

300
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,689
l think we could use
your talents.

301
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,988
You interested?

302
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,460
When do l start?

303
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,053
You ever hear of Clark Devlin?

304
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,859
Rumors and innuendo.

305
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,388
Del, l could tell you
a thing or two

306
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,695
about Clark Devlin.

307
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,168
Uh, you think we
could keep our minds

308
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:53,001
out of the gutter
for about a second?

309
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,199
Meet me upstairs
in an hour.

310
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,935
CHALMERS:
You might just become

311
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,567
Clark Devlin's next partner.

312
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,134
DEVLlN:
l'm going to need

313
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:01,476
that Gerris marginalis
as soon as possible.

314
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:03,106
WOMAN:
Yes. My contacts in Guatemala

315
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,810
have what you're looking for,
l'm sure.

316
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,182
Good.

317
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,482
And, meanwhile...

318
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:13,523
l'll take one of these
beautiful Uticella marginalis.

319
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,320
Just gorgeous.

320
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:20,992
( quiet chuckle )

321
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22,967
Now, you're going to call me?

322
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:24,299
ls your phone number on file?

323
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:25,565
l'm having a bit of trouble

324
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:27,334
with the phones at the moment.
lt might be better

325
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:28,840
if you dropped it off yourself.

326
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,034
lt may take a while.

327
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:31,043
Well, why don't you

328
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,442
familiarize yourself
with the route?

329
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,470
There's a little gathering
at my house tonight--

330
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,641
a fund-raiser for
the Natural History Museum.

331
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:39,480
l would so love to have you.

332
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,146
( mouthing )

333
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:43,018
Should l send a car?

334
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:44,784
l drive myself.

335
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,121
Admirable.

336
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:49,059
Eight o'clock.

337
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:51,120
And, uh, be sure
not to wear anything

338
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,859
too distracting, or no one
will get their checkbooks out.

339
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:58,770
How did you learn
to be so smooth?

340
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,795
l've seen the way you drive.

341
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,831
You have
the same instincts l do.

342
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,137
You lack confidence.

343
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,804
The girl in the art gallery's
not beyond you, you know.

344
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:08,108
You know about her?

345
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:09,614
Every time we leave the house

346
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,640
we go by the art gallery
and slow down.

347
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:12,981
You just need a little polish.

348
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,012
( deep voice ):
l'll never be a Clark Devlin.

349
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:19,047
Don't tell anyone this, Jimmy,
but there's a lot less

350
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,025
to Clark Devlin
than meets the eye.

351
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,152
l've got a couple of good lines

352
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:23,559
and a couple of
very expensive suits.

353
00:16:23,596 --> 00:16:25,188
Apart from that,
we're exactly the same.

354
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,199
How about
a couple hundred million?

355
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,757
Trust me...
90% of it is clothes.

356
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:29,961
The other ten percent?

357
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,833
The other ten percent's
in there.

358
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:33,270
You've got plenty of it.

359
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:36,537
Oh, Mr. Devlin,
can l ask you a big favor?

360
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:37,769
Yeah?

361
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,176
Can l stop wearing my hat?

362
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:48,086
All right.

363
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,144
Thank you.

364
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:51,486
No, just stay smooth.
Remember-- smooth.

365
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:52,650
Thank you.

366
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:56,752
Steena, Devlin.

367
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,458
This driver, this Jimmy,
l like him.

368
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,693
Let's get him a proper suit.

369
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:03,133
Something sexy. You pick it out.

370
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,103
All right.

371
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:06,798
Always a delight
talking to you, too, darling.

372
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,101
( phone beeps off )

373
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,573
Home, James.

374
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,236
Absolutely, Mr. Devlin.

375
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:14,769
( Argentine tango music plays )

376
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:55,210
( tango ends )

377
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:56,320
Oh!

378
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:57,481
Oops.

379
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,793
Watch your step.

380
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:03,590
Thank you, sir.

381
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:09,662
( Jimmy humming )

382
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:21,841
( continues humming )

383
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:25,910
( humming stops )

384
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:37,858
Oh...
This definitely not a rental.

385
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:38,864
Hello.

386
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:40,798
My name's Clark Devlin.

387
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,892
Would you like to dance?

388
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:44,596
Would you like to dance?

389
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:45,831
( chuckles )

390
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,771
Admirable.

391
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:54,408
There is just one rule.

392
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:55,277
( gasps )

393
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:58,374
Never touch my tuxedo.

394
00:18:58,417 --> 00:18:59,543
l didn't.

395
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:00,643
Good.

396
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,085
Don't.

397
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:04,055
Yes, sir.

398
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,387
Jimmy.

399
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:07,414
Get the car.

400
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,620
Let's go for dinner.

401
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,693
Yes, sir.

402
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:20,930
* *

403
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,406
What'll you have? lt's my treat.

404
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:29,436
Anything.

405
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:30,449
All right.

406
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,974
Two Whoppers,
hold the onion, extra ketchup.

407
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:34,747
Toast the bottom bun only,
medium well-done.

408
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:35,981
Two large fries,
extra well-done.

409
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:39,013
Two chocolate milkshakes,
however the chef likes.

410
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,025
That's it.

411
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:41,959
Your order's ready.
Pull forward.

412
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:47,495
That's pretty quick.

413
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,023
lt's fast food. Anything else?

414
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,092
DEVLlN:
Yeah.

415
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,126
l'll have a personal pizza,
crispy crust.

416
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,002
He doesn't eat out much.

417
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,701
They don't serve pizza
at Burger...

418
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:02,475
New item, huh?

419
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:05,382
Do you have chicken chow mein?

420
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:08,141
Thank you.

421
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,450
-Jimmy?
-Yes?

422
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:15,483
lt's a drive-through.
Let's drive.

423
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:16,927
Watch out!

424

( beeping )

426
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:25,695
Watch it, man!

427
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:27,934
Sorry, pal.

428
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:29,065
Let's go.

429

* *

430
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:42,820
JlMMY:
Why are we running away

431
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:43,981
from a skateboard?

432
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:45,752
l think it's probably a bomb.

433
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,349
( chuckles )

434
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:48,758
l thought you said a bomb.

435
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:52,162
What do you mean, a bomb?

436
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,465
( horns honking )

437
00:20:58,604 --> 00:20:59,969

No good. Out!

445
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:47,018
Mr. Dev...

446
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:47,950
Move!

Yeah, all in a day's work, eh?

Look.

Oh, damn.

Mr. Devlin.

You got any aspirin?

my mother's maiden name for?

00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:49,870
Last time she was

He might be here a while.

506
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,229
You might want to get him

507
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,898
some things from home
in case he comes to.

508
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:21,963
Oh.

509
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,406
He had this clutched
in his hand.

510
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:24,909
l don't know
if it means anything.

511
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:27,275
WOMAN ( on P.A. ):
Orderly with wheels

512
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:28,711
to the front desk.

513
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:32,114
l do need Dr. Angelo.

514
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:33,118
Dr. Angelo.

515
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:35,780
Dr. Angelo is on holiday today.

516
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:38,722
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

517
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:44,584
( seagulls calling )

518
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:48,427
BANNlNG, lNC.,
FLOATlNG HEADQUARTERS

519
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,025
MAN:
l'll tell you,
l'm pretty excited.

520
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:51,695
l mean, nervous,
but l'm excited.

521
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:53,034
l'm pumped, you know.

522
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:55,130
l knew l was doing good work
for Banning lnternational

523
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:56,436
but l didn't know Mr. Banning

524
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:58,409
would be taking so much notice
of me so soon.

525
00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:00,434
l'll say this, though,
when l'm CEO of this place

526
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,878
l won't be having
my headquarters

527
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,745
in the bottom of a boat,
you know what l mean?

528
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:08,014
MAN 2:
Why did you choose Mr. Lundeen?

529
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:10,647
He questioned
my growth projections.

530
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:11,747
( clanking )

531
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:19,096
No, that's not it.

532
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:22,259
l don't like his hair.

533
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,528
Mr. Banning.

534
00:25:25,571 --> 00:25:29,337
So, word filtered
down to me

535
00:25:29,374 --> 00:25:33,435
that you don't share my optimism
about our company's future.

536
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:35,343
Oh, no.

537
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,312
Actually, l just...

538
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:37,144
Drink?

539
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:38,513
Oh, yes, thank you.

540
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,347
l just felt that to meet

541
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:42,853
your projections, pretty much
every person on Earth

542
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:45,152
would have to drink
only Banning Springs water.

543
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,782
Yes, indeed.

544
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:50,261
Water, Mr. Lundeen,
comprises 60% of your body.

545
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,195
Don't you find it incredible

546
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:55,894
that two hydrogen atoms
and an oxygen atom can combine

547
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:57,663
to create something
so beautiful

548
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:59,398
so useful, so essential?

549
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,463
l find water to be

550
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:03,667
miraculous.

551
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,370
Do you think l'm silly?

552
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,002
Not at all.

553
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,069
( clears throat )

554
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:11,045
Feeling thirsty?

555
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,710
Yes.

556
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:15,379
BANNlNG:
You're helping me out
by being a guinea pig

557
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,717
for a new product.

558
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:17,687
Oh, l see.

559
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:19,520
What a brilliant idea.

560
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:21,958
Water that makes you thirsty.

561
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:23,985
What's in it?

562
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:25,053
Salt?

563
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:29,824
There's no profundity in salt.

564
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:30,994
( chuckles )

565
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:32,060
Bacteria.

566
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:33,162
Once ingested

567
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:36,834
its DNA will instruct
your cells' cytoplasm

568
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,935
to spill electrolytes
into your bloodstream

569
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:42,276
causing dehydration.

570
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:43,281
( groaning )

571
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:44,111
lt's virulent

572
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,242
but, unfortunately,
it's too fast.

573
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:47,547
Way too fast.

574
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:51,420
As we speak, your internal
organs are shriveling.

575
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:55,358
You're becoming as dry as...

576
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:58,363
Well, as dry
as your limited imagination.

577
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:06,799
Gentlemen,
fetch the vacuum, won't you?

578
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:08,863
Thank you.

579
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,138
Schiffer, Schwartzkopf,
Sondheim, Springsteen...

580
00:27:19,785 --> 00:27:21,309
No Strider.

581
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:23,786

582
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:38,828
( beeping )

583
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,157
Wow.

584
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:10,023
( beeps )

585
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:12,997

586
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,223
TUX:

Okay, show me.

( beeps )

593
00:28:57,949 --> 00:28:58,916
Uh-oh.

594
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,747
TUX:
Caution-- demolition mode.

595
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:02,185
The Tuxedo will consider

596
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,088
any object a target
and act to destroy it.

598
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,466
Oh, what's happening?

600
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,699

Burn, baby, burn

604
00:29:57,976 --> 00:29:59,705
Disco inferno

605
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:01,541
Burn, baby, burn

606
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,480
Burn the mother down

607
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:04,607
Burn, baby, burn...

608
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,742

MAN:
Mr. Devlin, is everything
all right?

612
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:13,822
This is Jimmy.

613
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:16,259
l think Mr. Devlin wants you
to clean his room tomorrow.

614
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,228
lt's a little bit messy.

615
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:20,458
l think he threw the party.

616
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:21,761
Should l send someone up now?

617
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,358
No. Maybe after he leaves.

618
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:24,390
Very good.

619
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,063

620
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:27,036
Hmm?

C.S.A. OPERATlONS

Mr. Devlin, so please

00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:43,215
stop using
that ridiculous accent.

630
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:44,222
What?

631
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:45,280
What accent?

632
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:46,312
All right.

633
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:47,382
You're the senior officer.

634
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:48,687
l'll play it however you want.

635
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:51,093
Deitrich Banning is holding
a meeting with water CEOs.

636

The Agency wants us to find out
what he's planning.

637
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,759
Wh-What about Walter Strider?

00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,233
Who is he?

''l forgot my bra.''

647
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:15,012
That passes

648
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:16,611
for humor around here.

00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:17,952

Uh, yeah.

656
00:31:38,476 --> 00:31:40,273
Nice rack.

Hello.

660
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:54,624
Mr. Devlin, there's been
a change of plans.

661
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,126
But l'm here already.
Where are you?

662
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:57,492
Don't get all pissy about it.

They just told me,

667
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:09,436
Oh, now you tell me.

668
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:10,998
Oh, hey, there he is.
Oh, my God, that's him.

673
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:16,445
WOMAN:
Get back here, you creep!

674
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:35,025
( sighs )

675
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:42,663
So, we've got five minutes
to get into position.

676
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:43,867
l secured the rooftop.

677
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,307
The equipment's good to go

678
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:46,537
and l just have to say

679
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:50,571
it is such an honor to be
working with the legendary...

680
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:53,675
Clark Devlin?

681
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,717
l'm Del Blaine.

682
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:00,589
Have we met before?

683
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,525
No.

684
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,118
Good.

685
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:06,960
Okay, Del Blaine, let's do
what we've come here to do.

686
00:33:06,998 --> 00:33:08,989
l'll follow you.

687
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:11,796
Ladies first.

688
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:14,066
Okay.

689
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:19,471
A couple of details changed
from what was in the file.

690
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:20,500
You read it?

691
00:33:20,545 --> 00:33:21,512
The files are crap.

692
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:22,638
Give me the
short version.

693
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,342
Deitrich Banning's
holding a meeting

694
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:26,714
of international
water company CEOs.

695
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:27,979
We think he's trying
to force them

696
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,350
into selling
their companies to him.

697
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:30,581
Where are you going?

698
00:33:30,622 --> 00:33:31,646
Huh?

699
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,918
l'm thinking.

700
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:34,618
We had Agent Wallace
working undercover

701
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:35,921
at his bottled water factory.

702
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,154
That is, until last week.

703
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:38,787
Wallace calls us
on his cell phone

704
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,458
to tell us that the operation
had reached critical mass

705
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:42,659
and, suddenly, wham! Dead.

706
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:58,043
As you requested, a Klineholtz
bolt-action nine-millimeter

707
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,382
titanium folding stock with
20-time infrared sniper-scope

708
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,444
and counterweighted
micro-rifled barrel.

709
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:07,456
My favorite gun.

710
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,858
But l don't kill
people anymore.

711
00:34:09,894 --> 00:34:10,861
Killing?

712
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:12,658
You're planting a bug.

713
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:16,189
lt was all in that ''crap'' file.

714
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:18,031
Go look through your binoculars.

715
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,067
( beeping )

716
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,073
They're arriving.

717
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:58,075
Ready?

718
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:00,339
lt's critical we get
a listening device

719
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:01,970
in Banning's meeting.

720
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:04,811
Range-- 962 feet.

721
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:08,713
Aim for the briefcase.

722
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,721
Should be a piece
of cake for you, sir.

723
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,126
( yelling )

724
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,650
( foghorn blowing )

725
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:21,565
You kind of missed.

726
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:33,668
( ricochet )

727
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:51,991
( metallic clunk )

728
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:56,597
BANNlNG:
ln the year 2001

729
00:35:56,634 --> 00:36:01,662
$35 billion worth of bottled
water was consumed worldwide.

730
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:05,369
Today, bottled water costs more
per gallon than gasoline.

731
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,676
We, my friends,
are the new oil barons.

732
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,477
BANNlNG ( through headset ):
We at Banning Springs

733
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:12,813
have developed
a new filtration process

734
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:14,409
that would protect your assets

735
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:17,819
against the biological holocaust
that's coming.

736
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:19,414
Looks like we got company.

737
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:20,719
CSA would be my bet.

738
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:25,693
You've heard what l have to say.

739
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,324
Now l'd like to hear you.

740
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:30,425
How much is this plan
going to cost us?

741
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:32,936
lt won't cost you a penny,
out of pocket.

742
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:34,336
All l ask is to become

743
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:37,102
your slightly-more-
than-equal partner.

744
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:39,336
DEL:
Banning says he's got
the only process

745
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:40,867
to make their water safe.

746
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:42,402
But to use it,
they've got to give him

747
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,244
half of their companies?

748
00:36:44,282 --> 00:36:45,544
He's trying to muscle
these guys

749
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,551
into selling
their companies to him.

750
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,314
Banning says that their
water sources are in danger.

751
00:36:49,354 --> 00:36:51,618
Something about everyone
being defenseless

752
00:36:51,656 --> 00:36:53,487
against more deadly
forms of bacteria.

753
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:55,720
l can barely make out
what he's saying.

754
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,489
Do you want to listen to this?

755
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:02,565
What do you think
that means, sir?

756
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,567
Del Blaine!

757
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,865
Yeah, l'll be there
in a minute.

758
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:08,964
Yeah, l'd really like
some help up here, sir.

759
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:12,332
Del Blaine!

760

DEL:
Do you hear me, sir?

761
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:15,839
l know this is not
near as exciting

762
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,371
as most of your missions,
but could you humor me

763
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,111
with just a little
professionalism?

764
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:22,585
l would really
love some help...

765
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,882

( grunting )

What's with the jumpy-jumpy?

768
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:29,960
Take off your headphones!

769

-What?
-Your headphones!

and end up... uh...

842
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:18,945
-You okay?
-( panting )

843
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:23,249
( rhythmic breathing )

844
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:27,349
Would you stop that?

845
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:29,325
JlMMY:
lt's okay.

846
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,691
l am in the car
with a psychopath.

847
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:32,719
We are not safe.

848
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:33,855
Are you upset?

849
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:35,058
Why would l be upset?

850
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:37,431
l've always wanted
to begin and end my career

851
00:42:37,468 --> 00:42:39,060
with a big fat failure!

852
00:42:39,103 --> 00:42:41,435
Thank you very much, Mr. Devlin.

853
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:43,497
lt's my first time.

854
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:46,635
l mean... every mission
is like my first time.

855
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:49,840
lt's so difficult
being Clark Devlin.

856
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:52,247
Oh.

857
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:54,717
Sorry.

Aah!

( coughing )

862
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:01,883
l didn't do that.

863
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:02,893
What...

864
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:05,293
i-is wrong with you?!

865
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:06,728
l'm not who you think l am.

866
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:07,890
Stay away!

867
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:10,492
l'm a little over-amped
myself right now.

868
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:12,126
Let's just call it a day.

869
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:14,069
Get some rest and medication.

870
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:14,935
What?

871
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:17,065
We'll be in communication.

872
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:18,166
Oh.

873
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:22,141

or why l'm doing it.

STEENA:
l felt the same way

00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:42,392
when l took my first
field assignment.

882
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:43,525
Then l met Clark Devlin

883
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:45,057
and life just got
a whole lot better...

884
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:47,434

Everybody warned me,
he was unorthodox

bordering on nutso.

We'll just get, uh... That's it.

891

There, yeah. That's it, there.

892
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,308
Look at that.

Move it over, over just a bit.

894
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:03,381
He's getting under your skin,
isn't he?

895
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:05,616
He got under my skin once

896
00:44:05,656 --> 00:44:07,487
and l'm still feeling it.

897
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,158
Yeah, you told me.

898
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:13,220
What about his English?

899
00:44:13,264 --> 00:44:15,494
Oh, l can never understand
half of what he says

900
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:17,194
but don't you just love
his accent?

901
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:19,065
She can't hear
anything from here...?

No, l don't think... Whoa!

She's got issues, man.

908
00:44:37,088 --> 00:44:38,055
Holy...

00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:39,181
Can your, uh, can your

910
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:40,349
girlfriend shoot, uh...

They ran out of ''Get well soon.''

You said to wear this,
but l don't know.

919
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:02,335
Being Clark Devlin is not easy.

925
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,152
Not so good, l'm afraid.

926
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:16,853
Well, you've got a few hours

927
00:45:16,894 --> 00:45:18,452
to pull yourself together.

928
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:19,520
What do you mean?

929
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:21,997
After the fiasco
of planting the bug

930
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:23,057
l'd say we have
only one choice:

931
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,591
Level One surveillance.

932
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:26,603
ln other words...

933

ls this a black-tie event?

938
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:38,271
No. But l'm sure you'll
wear whatever you want.

939
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:40,943
Maybe we can find
Walter Strider.

940
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:42,543
Meet you there at 8:00.

947
00:45:50,995 --> 00:45:52,292
-Huh?
-( groans )

948
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:53,762
Uh, he needs help.

949
00:45:53,798 --> 00:45:55,390
Security! Security!

My love has come along

953
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:26,628
My lonely days are over...

954

You're a billionaire

979
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:12,508
and you try to grease
the guy with seven bucks?

980
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:14,443
You think l have money
to throw away?

981
00:47:14,478 --> 00:47:16,776
You on the list?

982
00:47:16,814 --> 00:47:17,974
( sighing ):
Perfect.

983
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,004
Let me talk to him.

984
00:47:19,049 --> 00:47:20,607
No. You know what,

Aw, thanks.

Now, where did l put

990
00:47:35,032 --> 00:47:36,727
What's happening, Snowman?

991
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:37,859

We came to see your show and...

Yeah, she forgot
to make reservations.

1004
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:04,494
Don't worry about it.

Oh, thank you very much,

See? The things work out.

1008
00:48:09,466 --> 00:48:12,333
There's one more thing
l'd like to say, um...

1009
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:14,064
lt's not the in thing today

1010
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:15,469
to give compliments
to a young lady

1011
00:48:15,506 --> 00:48:17,599
but l just got

You killed James Brown.

1020
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:33,417
No, he's fine.

1021
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:34,583
He's not fine.

1022
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,752
And Banning is going to leave.

1023

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

Are you... praying?

1026
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:43,294
Miss Cleo told me

$4.99-a-minute Miss Cleo?

That would be very nice.

1174
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:38,687
The thing is, l, uh...

1175
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:43,853
l have a small problem...
trusting people.

1176
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:48,991
l don't know if l can trust
myself with you, Deitrich.

1177
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:51,432
Well, maybe we can come up

1178
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:54,096
with a way for you to pro...

1179
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:03,609
Her name's Del Blaine.
She's CSA.

1180
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:05,205
Oh, bloody hell.

1181
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:09,582
He drives a BMW,
registered to Clark Devlin.

1182
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:13,112
You told me you
dealt with Devlin

1183
00:55:13,156 --> 00:55:15,818
with the skateboard bomb.

1184
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:18,885
Yeah, well, he looks
pretty alive to me.

1185
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:20,829
Pretty good dancer.
He's all over Cheryl.

1186
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:22,695
You want me to do
something about that?

1187
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:24,667
No.

1188
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:25,861
Maybe the rancid tart

1189
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:28,063
might actually be
of some use for once.

1190
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:29,436
Get the boys, would you?

1191
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:35,239
Whoo! l am so bushed.

1192
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:37,269
l'm sorry,
you'll have to excuse me.

1193
00:55:37,314 --> 00:55:39,179
Unfortunate interruptus.

1194
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:41,116
So, my long streak of love,
here is the key

1195
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:42,379
to the hospitality suite

1196
00:55:42,419 --> 00:55:45,547
should you feel the need
to spend the night.

1197
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:47,113
Good-bye.

1198
00:55:47,157 --> 00:55:49,182
Well, l think l'll just go up

1199
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:52,559
to room 7-2-- excuse me-- 6-8

1200
00:55:52,596 --> 00:55:54,223
and take a long, hot bath

1201
00:55:54,264 --> 00:55:57,791
in room 7-2-6-8.

1202
00:55:57,834 --> 00:55:58,562
Good night.

1203
00:55:58,602 --> 00:55:59,591
Good night.

1204
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,308
( chuckles )

1205
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:08,243
And once again,
we end up with nothing.

1206
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:10,041
l can get her to talk.

1207
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,513
And say what?

1208
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:13,846
( ditzy voice ):
Oh, Emperor,
would you sign my bra?

1209
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:16,182
Oops, l'm not wearing one.

1210
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:17,413
( giggles )

1211
00:56:17,454 --> 00:56:19,319
What is it with you and bras?

1212
00:56:19,356 --> 00:56:20,687
She has information.

1213
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:23,192
Oh, right, and that's why you
have to go up to her hotel room.

1214
00:56:23,226 --> 00:56:25,421
You have never seen my work.

1215
00:56:25,462 --> 00:56:28,397
This is what
Clark Devlin does best.

1216
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:29,922
Can l go home?

1217
00:56:29,966 --> 00:56:31,593
No, you have to cover me.

1218
00:56:31,635 --> 00:56:33,262
With what, a shot of penicillin?

1219
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:34,270
Huh?

1220
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:35,271
Fine.

1221
00:56:35,305 --> 00:56:37,637
l'll be waiting by the pool.

1222
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:38,641
Oh, wait.

1223
00:56:38,675 --> 00:56:40,643
What's her room number again?

1224
00:56:40,677 --> 00:56:42,144
( ditzy voice ):
7-2-6-8.

1225
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:45,444
7-2-6-8. 7-2-6-8. 7-2-6-8.

1226
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:49,009
( amplified, slow motion
footsteps echoing )

1227
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:15,341
( ''You'll Never Find Another
Love Like Mine'' begins )

1228
00:57:15,378 --> 00:57:17,505
Yoo-hoo!

1229
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:19,674
Cheryl!

1230
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:21,183
CHERYL:
Hey, you little devil.

1231
00:57:21,218 --> 00:57:22,378
You'll never find...

1232
00:57:22,419 --> 00:57:24,046
What kind of bubbles
do you like?

1233
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:25,349
Little...

1234
00:57:25,388 --> 00:57:26,719
As long as you live

1235
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:27,724
...or big?!

1236
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:28,725
( clattering )

1237
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:30,920
Someone who loves you

1238
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:33,191
Hang it for me, will you?

1239
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:37,564
Tender like l do

1240
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:40,161
Whoa, l'm not bragging
on myself...

1241
00:57:40,203 --> 00:57:41,170
So...

1242
00:57:41,204 --> 00:57:43,365
l know you can dance, but...

1243
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:45,203
what else can you do?

1244
00:57:45,242 --> 00:57:46,300
Get on the bed.

1245
00:57:46,343 --> 00:57:47,310
l'll show you.

1246
00:57:47,344 --> 00:57:48,641
( giggling )

1247
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:49,645
Oh!

1248
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:50,805
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

1249
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,405
( beeping )

1250
00:57:52,449 --> 00:57:55,646
Okay, Mr. Devlin,
let's see your magic.

1251
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:57,778
( Cheryl moaning erotically )

1252
00:57:57,821 --> 00:58:00,187
Oh, my God, your hands
are like a machine.

1253
00:58:00,223 --> 00:58:03,249
Oh, l am never working
with him again.

1254
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:07,229
So, tell me about Deitrich's
good friend, Walter Strider.

1255
00:58:07,264 --> 00:58:08,322
( bones cracking )

1256
00:58:08,365 --> 00:58:10,128
Oh! Never heard of him...

1257
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:12,226
but l know Dry Martini.

1258
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:14,635
Maybe someone should mix us
a couple.

1259
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:18,072
Y-O-U spells ''you.''

1260
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:19,336
( giggles softly )

1261
00:58:19,376 --> 00:58:21,469
( chuckles )

1262
00:58:21,511 --> 00:58:22,500
Oh.

1263
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:25,572
You're smart.

1264
00:58:25,615 --> 00:58:27,276
Really?

1265
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:28,443
And a good speller.

1266
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:29,452
( giggling )

1267
00:58:29,486 --> 00:58:30,817
Thanks. l graduated
top two-thirds

1268
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,651
of my sixth grade class.

1269
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:36,653
But l know somehow, some way...

1270
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:37,955
What a gentleman.

1271
00:58:37,994 --> 00:58:39,484
Some way, you are...

1272
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:41,656
You're gonna miss my lovin'...

1273
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:45,794
Look, it's Cocktail Barbie.

1274
00:58:45,836 --> 00:58:47,326
Take your clothes off
and stay a while.

1275
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:48,359
l-l like my clothes on.

1276
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:49,372
Kinky boy.

1277
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:50,430
Wh-Wh...?

1278
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:51,405
Where did you
get that pin?

1279
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:53,375
Oh. Deitrich.

1280
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,536
Want to have a closer look?

1281
00:58:54,578 --> 00:58:55,272
Huh?

1282
00:58:55,312 --> 00:58:56,301
( giggling )

1283
00:58:58,481 --> 00:59:00,472
l'm sorry.

1284
00:59:00,517 --> 00:59:02,280
Look at the time. l got to go.

1285
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:03,445
Oh, Emperor.

1286
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:04,453
( yelling )

1287
00:59:04,487 --> 00:59:05,749
( shrieking )

1288
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:07,950
Where are you going?

1289
00:59:07,991 --> 00:59:09,049
JlMMY:
What are you doing?

1290
00:59:09,092 --> 00:59:09,854
Oh, Emperor.

1291
00:59:09,893 --> 00:59:12,760
( both shrieking )

1292
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:14,161
Oh, where are you going

1293
00:59:14,197 --> 00:59:15,664
you naughty boy?

1294
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:19,294
l adore romance when it's rough.

1295
00:59:19,336 --> 00:59:20,166
Whoo!

1296
00:59:20,203 --> 00:59:21,966

00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:32,904
( angry grunt )

1302
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:34,041
Get back here!

1303
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:34,914
You're dead meat!

1304
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,111
Come on!

1305

( panting )

1308

Take a bath.

1309
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:56,203
Oh, yes, because l've been
a dirty, dirty girl.

( gasping )

1312
00:59:58,141 --> 00:59:59,165
Go fill the tub.

1313
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:00,301
Do you like it with bubbles?

1314
01:00:00,343 --> 01:00:01,310
Hot bubbles.

1315
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:03,278
( shrieking ):
Oh, yippee!

1316
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:04,280
Yippee!

1317

( shrieking )

1318
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:09,251
CHERYL:
Tiny bubbles in my wine...

1319
01:00:09,286 --> 01:00:11,015
Makes me feel fine

1320
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:13,113
Come on, her voice reminds me
of my mother.

1321

1322

What's happening?

01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:48,887
CHERYL:
What's going on under those
cute little boxers of yours?

Come to mama, Emperor!

1340
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:50,012
Say good night... agent!

1341
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:53,145
Del Blaine. Del Blaine.

1342
01:01:53,189 --> 01:01:54,156
( gasping )

1343
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:56,090
( man screaming )

1344
01:01:57,827 --> 01:01:59,488
( whirring and beeping )

1345
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:10,029
Sorry.

1346
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:13,542
CHERYL:
Emperor...

1347
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:14,634
This is not what
l signed up for!

1348
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:15,701
l need my bathroom bud.

1349
01:02:15,745 --> 01:02:16,905
Shh. She's in there
taking a bath.

1350
01:02:16,946 --> 01:02:17,844
What happened to your nose?

1351
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:18,870
( yelping )

1352
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:21,008
( gasping and yelping )

1353
01:02:21,051 --> 01:02:23,042
Sorry!

1354
01:02:23,086 --> 01:02:24,053
Honeymooners.

1355
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:26,282
Yes, some things never change.

1356
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:28,153
Emperor!

1357
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:30,250
Emperor, come back!

1358
01:02:30,293 --> 01:02:32,659
Please!

1359
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:33,889
( soft grunt )

1360
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,955
Oh...

1361
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:37,967
Go! Get going.

1362
01:02:39,969 --> 01:02:40,958
Ouch!

1363
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:45,634
Can't you do anything?

1364
01:02:45,675 --> 01:02:47,404
Why are you so mad?

1365
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:49,708
Gee, let me think.

1366
01:02:49,746 --> 01:02:52,647
Because big, ugly men
are trying to kill me?

1367
01:02:52,682 --> 01:02:54,115
Because l got stuck

1368
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:57,085
with a millionaire playboy
dilettante for a partner?

1369
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,281
You don't care
how you make people feel.

1370
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:00,414
l happen to be

1371
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:02,948
an extremely sensitive person.

1372
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:03,981
Ow!

1373
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:07,962
Okay, you think
you know feelings.

1374
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:09,123
Look at me.

1375
01:03:10,133 --> 01:03:12,658
How do l feel?

1376
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:13,669
Sick.

1377
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:14,635
Sad.

1378
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:15,899
What about now?

1379
01:03:18,741 --> 01:03:19,833
Constipated.

1380
01:03:21,644 --> 01:03:22,975
Creepy.

1381
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:24,570
Horny.

1382
01:03:25,582 --> 01:03:27,174
( exaggerated laughter ):
ls funny.

1383
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:28,844
( exaggerated yelling ):
ls angry.

1384
01:03:28,885 --> 01:03:30,318
( exaggerated scream ):
ls crazy.

1385
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:31,684
You know nothing.

1386
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:34,189
This is why you don't have
a boyfriend.

1387
01:03:34,224 --> 01:03:36,590
No wonder you didn't get
anything from Banning.

1388
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:39,561
Oh... right, l didn't
get anything from Banning

1389
01:03:39,596 --> 01:03:41,928
except where
his friggin' lab is.

1390
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:43,694
Where?

1391
01:03:43,733 --> 01:03:46,258
Let's see if the great master
''agent'' can figure it out.

1392
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:48,361
Banning said he sometimes
has trouble sleeping.

1393
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:49,371
Big secret.

1394
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:52,033
All men have trouble sleeping.

1395
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:54,976
Sometimes at night, he goes
down and works in his lab.

1396
01:03:55,011 --> 01:03:57,241
He sleeps in his lab?

1397
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,907
He sleeps in his bedroom.

1398
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:01,576
His lab's in his bedroom?

1399
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:02,380
No.

1400
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:04,249
Get your facts straight.

1401
01:04:04,287 --> 01:04:07,256
His lab is at his house--

1402
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,555
his casa, where he lives--
get it?

1403
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:14,023
Excellent.

1404
01:04:14,063 --> 01:04:16,623
You passed the test.

1405
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:18,566
l put in a good word
with the boss.

1406
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:20,125
Well, let's go
see Chalmers tonight.

1407
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:21,102
No.

1408
01:04:21,137 --> 01:04:22,263
Keep him out of this.

1409
01:04:22,305 --> 01:04:24,102
Just you and me.

1410
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,334
You know,
if you're so good at this

1411
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:26,899
why-why don't you tell me
something about me?

1412
01:04:26,943 --> 01:04:29,741
Okay.

1413
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:32,839
You have big crush on me

1414
01:04:32,882 --> 01:04:35,442
and l know your
name is Del Blaine.

1415
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:38,215
First of all, you wish, and...

1416
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:41,613
my real name is Delilah.

1417
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:43,819
Delilah?

1418
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,422
Suits you.

1419
01:04:48,598 --> 01:04:49,565
Hey...

1420
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:50,588
Hmm?

1421
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:01,905
( Jimmy grunting )

1422
01:05:01,945 --> 01:05:02,877
Ooh!

1423
01:05:02,912 --> 01:05:04,038
( laughing ):
Oh!

1424
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,640
( shrieking ):
Oh... oh, Emperor!

1425
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:07,741
JlMMY:
Hey!

1426
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:11,117
Oh, God, Clark,
isn't anything sacred?

1427
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:14,089
Oh, rug burns are so sexy!

1428
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:15,818
lt's the driver.

1429
01:05:15,858 --> 01:05:16,825
Oh, my God.

1430
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,157
( Cheryl laughing )

1431
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:22,630
( techno-pop dance music plays )

1432
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:23,927
Thank you.

1433
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,161
lnvitations?

1434
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:26,532
Oh, yes.

1435
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:28,537
Why don't you offer him
five bucks?

1436
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:30,198
l have them somewhere.

1437
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,333
Birds of a feather...

1438
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:34,366
Nice party, huh?

1439
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:37,342
So, you're the strong,
silent type, huh?

1440
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,075
That's the whole
bouncer package.

1441
01:05:39,115 --> 01:05:40,639
( whirring and beeping )

1442
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:42,913
l didn't mean your package.

1443
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:43,919
Thank you...

1444
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:46,444
Dr. Schwartz.

1445
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:47,456
Shalom.

1446
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:48,479
Come, darling.

1447
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:52,227
Product launch, my ass.

1448
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:54,594
Let's go find
Banning's lab.

1449
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:56,895
( techno dance music blaring )

1450
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:28,228
Let's go.

1451
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:52,351
( gate squeaking )

1452
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:57,022
Are you trying to get me alone?

1453
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,220
Where'd they go?

1454
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:00,729
Don't tell me
the great Clark Devlin

1455
01:07:00,763 --> 01:07:02,822
can't come up with an answer.

1456
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:04,230
( water splashing )

1457
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:16,171
Although

1458
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:18,271
he can walk on water.

1459
01:07:20,216 --> 01:07:23,549
lt's a trick, right?

1460
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:28,521
( machinery grinding )

1461
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:39,860
Come on.

1462
01:07:51,214 --> 01:07:52,238
Wow!

1463
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:53,908
Mr. Devlin likes insects, too.

1464
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:54,917
What?

1465
01:07:54,951 --> 01:07:56,316
Oh, uh, uh, l mean

1466
01:07:56,352 --> 01:07:59,116
sometime l speak of myself
in the third person.

1467
01:07:59,155 --> 01:08:01,419
Hmm, Del Blaine
thinks you're a freak.

1468
01:08:02,558 --> 01:08:03,991
MAN:
Have you cleaned the tanks?

1469
01:08:04,026 --> 01:08:05,653
( indistinct voices )

1470
01:08:05,695 --> 01:08:07,128
JlMMY:
What are they doing down there?

1471
01:08:07,163 --> 01:08:08,152
DEL:
l don't know.

1472
01:08:08,197 --> 01:08:09,562
MAN:
When you're done here

1473
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,793
you can go
and sweep the tunnels.

1474
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:11,822
Don't use the blower!

1475
01:08:11,868 --> 01:08:13,233
l can tell the difference.

1476
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:15,134
And don't touch the tequila
for me and Mr. Banning.

1477
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:16,297
Whatever you say there,
Dr. Simms.

1478
01:08:16,339 --> 01:08:17,306
Yes, Dr. Simms.

1479
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:18,307
Louder!

1480
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:20,366
BOTH:
Yes, Dr. Simms.

1481
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:22,935
We better hope the little
ones follow the queen.

1482
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:24,037
Well, if they don't

1483
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,274
the stock is going
to be worthless.

1484
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:26,838
''Follow the queen''?

1485
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:28,851
Huh? Have you seen Cheryl?

1486
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:30,079
Maybe he's gay.

1487
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:31,279
Cheryl? No.

1488
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,582
WORKER:
Man, let's get out of here.

1489
01:08:32,622 --> 01:08:34,055
Let's go have a smoke.

1490
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:36,456
lt still stinks.

1491
01:08:42,598 --> 01:08:43,565
Hey.

1492
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:45,658
How did you...?

1493
01:08:45,701 --> 01:08:47,259
Whatever.

1494
01:08:47,303 --> 01:08:49,271
JlMMY:
Look at this.

1495
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,237
( air hissing )

1496
01:08:52,275 --> 01:08:54,800
He's pinpointed
the national reservoirs.

1497
01:08:54,844 --> 01:08:56,106
He's going to poison
the water?

1498
01:08:56,145 --> 01:08:57,169
Not with that stuff.

1499
01:08:57,213 --> 01:08:58,339
lt's too detectable

1500
01:08:58,381 --> 01:08:59,871
and there's
government safeguards.

1501
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:01,213
Let's check out the computer.

1502
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,615
Now you're thinking.

1503
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:05,484
( whirring and beeping )

1504
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:07,849
Who are they?

how is he possibly

Banning's got the bacteria

but he has to transport it
from his lab to the water.

There's no way he can.

you weren't Clark Devlin.

1581

Now take off the tuxedo.
lt doesn't belong to you.

l wanted to tell you,

Now, give me the watch
and the shoes.

1599
01:12:03,299 --> 01:12:04,789
Now, where's Clark Devlin
and how did you think

1600
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:05,994
you were going
to get away with this?

1601

Look, l'm here because of you.

They touch down

so no alarms sound,

Sorry, Mr. Banning,
it's your plan... and mine.

Um... it's ours.

01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:22,929
Shut up. Explain.

1670
01:15:22,965 --> 01:15:24,990
Oh, all righty.

1671
01:15:25,034 --> 01:15:27,434
The life cycle
of the Gerris maginatus

1672
01:15:27,469 --> 01:15:29,369
begins with mating--

1673
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:33,501
something Dr. Simms
is not personally familiar with.

1674
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:35,442
Anyhoo, the insects swarm

1675
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:36,944
to freshwater

1676
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:39,345
where fertilized eggs are then
deposited on the underside

1677
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:42,680
of lotus leaves
and hatch into larvae.

1678
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:45,710
Spare me
the Discovery Channel blather.

1679
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:46,743
( chuckles )

1680
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:48,950
Tell me why it won't work.

1681
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:50,117
Yes, tell us.

1682
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,922
Why it won't work?

1683
01:15:51,961 --> 01:15:55,226
This is the northern
hemisphere, correct?

1684
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:57,755
You incubated insects native
to the southern hemisphere.

1685
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:02,260
So, simply, it is too cold
for them to mature sexually--

1686
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:05,603
much like Simms here.

1687
01:16:05,641 --> 01:16:06,767
Therefore...

1688
01:16:06,809 --> 01:16:07,776
they won't mate.

1689
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:11,075
Therefore,
they won't seek out water.

1690
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:12,808
ls this true?

1691
01:16:12,848 --> 01:16:16,477
No, l knew a girl once,
in college, quite well.

1692
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:17,985
Very well.

1693
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,885
And then you remember
cousin Doris?

1694
01:16:19,922 --> 01:16:22,254
No, Simms, the bugs.

1695
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:23,588
The bugs.

1696
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:26,618
Oh, you're not going
to believe this hootchie

1697
01:16:26,662 --> 01:16:28,095
are you, Mr. Banning?

1698
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,119
Oh, yeah?

1699
01:16:29,164 --> 01:16:32,156
Ask him if l lied
about the tuxedo.

1700
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:35,261
This tuxedo is...
it's all right. lt's...

1701
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:36,362
''All right''?

1702
01:16:36,405 --> 01:16:38,339
That is the most incredible
piece of technology

1703
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:40,239
on the planet.

1704
01:16:40,276 --> 01:16:45,908
And l am laying it
in your big, hot hands.

1705
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:48,542
Mr. Banning, release the bugs.

1706
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:49,551
Go ahead.

1707
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:50,552
Do what he tells you.

1708
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:52,178
You might have a chance
at second prize

1709
01:16:52,221 --> 01:16:53,711
at a junior high school
science fair

1710
01:16:53,756 --> 01:16:56,452
but you can forget your dreams
of world domination.

1711
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:58,221
Slip into it, Deitrich.

1712
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,160
See how it feels.

1713
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:14,166
DEVLlN:
The other ten percent's
in there.

1714
01:17:14,209 --> 01:17:15,574
You've got plenty of it.

1715
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:26,154
Hey, Dr. Schwartz.

1716
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:30,181
Tell your boss
Clark Devlin is back.

1717
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:31,385

1721
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:05,754
Well, it certainly puts
a spring in one's step.

1722
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:07,728
Happy to have lightened
your loafers, Deitrich.

1723
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:09,321
One question.

1724
01:18:09,365 --> 01:18:10,627
Why are you doing this?

1725
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:13,260
( alarms blaring )

1726
01:18:15,637 --> 01:18:17,628
Hey, what the hell is this?

1727
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:20,972
This is the moment where
50 CSA commandos storm in

1728
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:23,205
take you,
your pretentious accent

01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,907
to the Federal pen where,
guess what?

1731
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:31,545
All they serve is highly
chlorinated tap water.

1732
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:34,579
Presenting Clark Devlin.

1733

( grunts )

1734
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:46,492
Have l told you how amazing
you look in this tuxedo?

1735
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:48,400
( groans )

1736
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:49,529
Simms, prepare for release.

1737
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:52,062
With pleasure, sir.

Why are you here?

1746

l've come to save you.

1747
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:16,831
That's great.

1748
01:19:16,865 --> 01:19:18,765
What about the big guys

Now we finally meet, l find
that the great Clark Devlin

01:19:29,111 --> 01:19:31,238
is nothing more
than an ordinary man

1754
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,875
who's about to die
an extraordinary death.

1755
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:35,975
You're right

1756
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:37,918
except for one thing.

1757

Uh, Jimmy, is there

1764
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:54,127

01:30:44,552 --> 01:30:45,576
DEL:
Shut up.

1997
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:46,609
STEENA:
Clark, you've been reassigned.

1998
01:30:46,654 --> 01:30:47,780
The voices are screaming
in my ear.

1999
01:30:47,822 --> 01:30:48,982
DEL:
Hey, if you can hear me

2000
01:30:49,023 --> 01:30:50,786
wipe that look off your face.

2001
01:30:50,825 --> 01:30:51,917
Remember me?

2002
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:52,927
Hooters.

2003
01:30:52,961 --> 01:30:54,326
( agents groan )

2004
01:30:54,362 --> 01:30:55,420
Soul patch.

2005
01:30:55,463 --> 01:30:57,829
Okay, l'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

2006

DEVLlN:
No, no! No, no!

2008

You're the love of my life.

2009
01:31:00,869 --> 01:31:02,666
No, you never tell them
you love them, Jimmy.

2010
01:31:02,704 --> 01:31:04,831
Can you have... dinner with me?

2011
01:31:04,873 --> 01:31:06,431
Get out.

2012
01:31:06,474 --> 01:31:08,465
Pretty sure he craps
his pants, people.

2013

-Lunch?
-Now!

2016
01:31:11,513 --> 01:31:12,571
Oh!

2017
01:31:12,614 --> 01:31:14,081
STEENA:
All right, we're
terminating this mission.

2018
01:31:14,115 --> 01:31:15,673
Pack it up and roll home.

2019
01:31:15,717 --> 01:31:19,483
l think l blew it, Mr. Devlin.

2020
01:31:19,521 --> 01:31:21,045
Jimmy, l wrote the book
on this stuff.

2021
01:31:21,089 --> 01:31:22,989
Trust me, you didn't blow it.
You outgrew her.

2022
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:23,991
Maybe.

2023
01:31:24,025 --> 01:31:25,117
Tell you what.
Take the weekend off.

2024
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,320
First thing Monday morning

2025
01:31:26,361 --> 01:31:28,329
we'll head for somewhere with
more interesting prospects.

2026
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:30,263
How about Monte Carlo?

2027
01:31:30,298 --> 01:31:31,265
Sounds good.

2028
01:31:31,299 --> 01:31:32,732
Thanks, Mr. Devlin.

2029
01:31:32,767 --> 01:31:34,200
Thanks, everybody.

2030
01:31:34,235 --> 01:31:35,202
AGENT:
lt's okay, Jimmy.

2031
01:31:35,236 --> 01:31:36,203
AGENT 2:
Hang in there.

2032
01:31:36,237 --> 01:31:37,704
AGENT 3:
Next time.

2033
01:31:37,739 --> 01:31:40,173
Well, if you were trying
to get her to notice you

2034
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:41,232
mission accomplished.

2035
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:43,369
What are you planning
for the second date?

2036
01:31:43,411 --> 01:31:44,400
Running at her with a knife?

2037
01:31:44,445 --> 01:31:46,606
lt's difficult for me.

2038
01:31:46,648 --> 01:31:47,615
What is so hard?

2039
01:31:47,649 --> 01:31:49,173
You just have to say
something like...

2040
01:31:49,217 --> 01:31:50,980
''Excuse me, you want
to go get some coffee?''

2041
01:31:51,019 --> 01:31:54,785
When l around beautiful
women, l can't talk.

2042
01:31:54,823 --> 01:31:57,724
Sure. Beautiful women.

2043
01:31:57,759 --> 01:31:58,987
You know, a real knockout.

2044
01:31:59,027 --> 01:32:00,892
Like the beautiful lady
in the gallery.

2045
01:32:00,929 --> 01:32:01,918
Thank you.

2046
01:32:01,963 --> 01:32:04,056
Thank you very much.

2047
01:32:04,098 --> 01:32:05,963
What's wrong?

2048
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,399
Nothing.

2049
01:32:07,435 --> 01:32:09,164
What?

2050
01:32:09,204 --> 01:32:11,604
You can't tell how l feel?

2051
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:14,437
You look sad.

2052
01:32:14,475 --> 01:32:15,703
No.

2053
01:32:15,743 --> 01:32:17,643
Sick?

2054
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:18,646
No.

2055
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:21,148
Constipated?

2056
01:32:21,182 --> 01:32:22,274
No.

2057
01:32:22,317 --> 01:32:23,716
A little.

2058
01:32:23,751 --> 01:32:26,083
Tell me, what's wrong?

2059
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,556
lt's just no guy would ever
do anything for me

2060
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:31,582
like what you did for her.

2061
01:32:31,626 --> 01:32:32,786
Or tried to do.

2062
01:32:32,827 --> 01:32:34,351
You know why?

2063
01:32:34,395 --> 01:32:38,661
Because you are
a pain in the butt.

2064
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:41,225
Yeah, nice working
with you, too.

2065
01:32:41,269 --> 01:32:43,829
Hello.

2066
01:32:43,872 --> 01:32:45,737
Delilah, excuse me.

2067
01:32:45,773 --> 01:32:48,867
You want to have a coffee?

2068
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:51,538
l only drink organic green tea.

2069

01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:53,836
Wrong answer.

2071
01:32:53,882 --> 01:32:56,146
You're never going
to have a boyfriend.

2072
01:32:56,184 --> 01:32:57,151
Fine.

2073

One, two, three, four

( laughing )

2100
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,434
The bird hit the guy.

2101
01:33:48,469 --> 01:33:49,436
Huh?

2102
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:50,767

Okay.

You think l'm speak
very good English, huh?

2107
01:33:58,279 --> 01:34:00,543
What's in your head,

What's in your head,

That's okay. Cut.

2111

No wonder.

2112
01:34:07,522 --> 01:34:09,581
This is why
you don't have a boyfriend.

2113
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:12,048
That's...

-Can we do a single on me?
-No.

2125
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:32,046
Action!

2126

Aah...

2127
01:34:34,549 --> 01:34:35,516

What is she doing?

2144

Hit me!

Oh, no!
