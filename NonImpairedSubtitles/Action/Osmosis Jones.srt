 1 
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:53,510
Dad, you have the coolest job.

 2 
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,518
l should hang out with
a better class of animals.

 3 
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:01,116
Oh, come on.

 4 
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,491
Have some class.
We got mixed company here.

 5 
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:12,768
You know, genetically speaking,
monkeys are our first cousins.

 6 
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,375
Uncle Bob's kids?
l'd agree with that.

 7 
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,943
No, l'm serious.

 8 
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:23,208
Some scientists say their diets
are more evolved.

 9 
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:25,852
This is about diets again, huh?

 10 
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:30,685
You should eat more fruits and
vegetables. Like monkeys do.

 11 
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:36,231
Honey, the reason that monkeys
eat so many fruits and vegetables...

 12 
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:40,029
...is because they're not
smart enough to butcher a cow.

 13 
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,369
Your mother, bless her soul,
didn't believe the old ideas...

 14 
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:47,011
...about nursing and breast-feeding.

 15 
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:50,047
You were fed cheeseburgers as a baby.

 16 
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,584
And you're as strong as a bull.
Smell like a cow.

 17 
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:57,014
High cholesterol,
but there's medicine.

 18 
00:01:57,225 --> 00:02:01,060
An angioplasty clears it out.
You're great, honey.

 19 
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,762
l'll start working out tomorrow.

 20 
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:14,845
-l'll take better care of myself.
-So you'll go on the hike with me?

 21 
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,049
First things first. Eat your lunch.

 22 
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:19,950
We'll talk later.

 23 
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:23,751
Give me that egg, pal!
Give me the egg!

 24 
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,125
Dad, stop it! What are you doing?

 25 
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:29,253
lt's my egg! Come on!

 26 
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:33,800
lt's just an egg!

 27 
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,171
Okay, now l gotta choke you!

 28 
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,111
Now who's evolved?

 29 
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,578
All that salad slow you down, buddy?

 30 
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:56,287
That's filthy.

 31 
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,361
Ten-second rule:

 32 
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:01,932
Hits the ground, you can
eat it within 10 seconds.

 33 
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:40,974
-Saliva one, what have you got?
-An egg 2-20. E-Gamma-Gamma. Over.

 34 
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:42,774
-Any mayo?
-Affiirmative.

 35 
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:43,973
Slow bowel traffiic....

 36 
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:47,612
Enzyme breakdown in ten.

 37 
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:51,521
When I was a rookie cell,
you could eat off this place.

 38 
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,286
Look at it now. Jeez...

 39 
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:55,224
...what a disgrace.

 40 
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,196
See anything, kid?

 41 
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,062
l do.

 42 
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,900
Nice genes. Got chromosomes
in all the right places.

 43 
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:06,010
-Jones.
-A toothbrush can handle this.

 44 
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,177
l wish you'd take this job
more seriously.

 45 
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,079
You see this badge?
You see this gun?

 46 
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:15,949
See this gooey sackus membranous
around my personhood?

 47 
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:19,957
-Here we go again.
-You dealing with a white blood cell!

 48 
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:25,429
I should fiight disease in the veins!
Not here, on tartar control!

 49 
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:27,432
Lucky you ain't in a scab.

 50 
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:29,798
We got germs on that egg.

 51 
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:32,271
Baby! lt's Ozzy time!

 52 
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:35,446
Probably gingivitis,
don't get carried away.

 53 
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:38,207
You have entered the city ofFrank.

 54 
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:40,942
Hands up.
Surrender for digestion.

 55 
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:44,648
Saliva one, requesting
ground support. Over.

 56 
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:47,953
Bicuspid four,
we're in the vicinity.

 57 
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:51,460
This is a private organism.
Don't run.

 58 
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:53,930
Up spit creek without a paddle.

 59 
00:04:54,736 --> 00:04:59,140
Don't get me mad.
I will turn into a germicidal maniac.

 60 
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,674
Halt. Saliva Patrol.

 61 
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,111
Son of a botulism!

 62 
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,646
They swiped the patrol car!

 63 
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:08,812
Get out ofhere.

 64 
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:12,383
You done done it now.

 65 
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:20,065
Holy Frank!

 66 
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:23,464
He 's about to yawn!

 67 
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,404
We 're getting sucked in!

 68 
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,239
l told city hall we need more sleep!

 69 
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:34,676
Hold tight, kid!

 70 
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:37,919
Osmosis Jones to dispatch.

 71 
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:41,387
We got multiple germs
coming down the windpipe.

 72 
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:45,255
If they hit the blood stream,
we'll be illing.

 73 
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:47,988
Nose-dripping,
chicken-soup-drinking...

 74 
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,498
...rectal-thermometer-sticking,
illing!

 75 
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:52,466
-Permission to pursue?
-Chief.

 76 
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:00,346
-You got plans for the weekend?
-Oh, yeah.

 77 
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:04,143
Me and my girlfriend are going
to the lKidneys to see the Stones.

 78 
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:06,377
Good, they could pass any day.

 79 
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:10,719
All units south of the stomach,
lookout for illegal organism.

 80 
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:13,225
Jones, you want to keep yourjob?

 81 
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,057
Wait for backup!

 82 
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:16,357
l can get them.

 83 
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:17,966
I said stay put.

 84 
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,034
-Over.
-You heard the chief.

 85 
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:21,967
Out ofourjurisdiction.

 86 
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:26,201
lt's lmmunity's problem.
We should get to the mouth.

 87 
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:30,143
-Hey, Jones!
-Chief, you'll thank me later.

 88 
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,878
Don't think about it.
You're in enough trouble.

 89 
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:35,578
Jones!

 90 
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:42,488
Slow down! Slow down!

 91 
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:45,734
Wait, wait, what the--?

 92 
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:49,003
Shouldn't you be up in the mouth?

 93 
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:52,403
This is my bust. l saw him first.

 94 
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:19,504
You want Osmosis? You got Osmosis.

 95 
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:30,983
Bye-bye, cop!

 96 
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:36,623
Sorry, baby. But it's time
you take your medicine.

 97 
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:51,073
Dang. Always pulls to the right.

 98 
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:03,686
Dad, what's wrong? Oh, my God.

 99 
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:05,589
lt's a cramp!

 100 
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:16,871
Officer down.

 101 
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:21,537
These stairs are killing me, honey.
We may have to move.

 102 
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,612
But, Dad, there's only four steps.

 103 
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,155
All right, if you love it here...

 104 
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:30,282
...l'll build a ramp.

 105 
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:45,264
lt's been three hours since lunch
and we're still cleaning up this egg.

 106 
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:48,878
Man, would you look at all that gunk.

 107 
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:50,070
Seriously.

 108 
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:54,151
Does he roll his food
on the ground before he eats it?

 109 
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:59,855
We need to send a letter to the mayor
about washing our hands before we eat.

 110 
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,367
Like he's going to listen to us.

 111 
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,432
Hey, cells vote, man.

 112 
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:12,197
Cells vote.

 113 
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,416
Got you, you little....

 114 
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:33,430
Artie?

 115 
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,462
What's going on over there?

 116 
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,472
Holy spit.

 117 
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,176
Careful, l'm contagious.

 118 
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:35,464
l don't like!

 119 
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:52,525
l'll turn up the heat in here.

 120 
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:12,148
Connecting, please hold.
One moment.

 121 
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:13,440
Now connecting.

 122 
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:17,919
Mr. Mayor, how will you deal
with the fat-cell housing shortage?

 123 
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:22,888
l'd like to announce we're beginning
construction on a third chin.

 124 
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,998
We're having jock itch!

 125 
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,599
Any comments on today's cramp?

 126 
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:30,398
What about the hair cells
laid off from the scalp?

 127 
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,474
There'll be plenty of new jobs
on the back.

 128 
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,338
What about the request
for better nutrition?

 129 
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:41,485
85% of red blood cell children
don't know how to carry oxygen.

 130 
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,382
People, people you worry too much.

 131 
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:47,081
The body is in perfect shape.

 132 
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:53,024
No more questions. Thank you.

 133 
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,634
Do they know l work hard?

 134 
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,966
Nobody cares.

 135 
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,803
-Mr. Mayor--
-Leah, l've got a body to run.

 136 
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:06,972
-l've got Tom Colonic's new ad.
-Let's go, put it on.

 137 
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:11,718
This is a paid announcement.

 138 
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:16,992
The bowels didn't always
smell this way.

 139 
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,755
Eating right and exercise...

 140 
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:22,730
...kept this area
a center ofactivity.

 141 
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:26,393
But during Phlemming's term,
rot and stagnation...

 142 
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:28,370
...paralyzed this neighborhood...

 143 
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:31,305
...the colon, and the sphincter.

 144 
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:34,414
It's time we get things moving again.

 145 
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:38,053
I'm Tom Colonic.
As mayor, I'd set long-term goals...

 146 
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:41,246
...that include salads
and eating bran.

 147 
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:45,895
Mayor Phlemming may think
things are fiine the way they are.

 148 
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:50,792
But if we pull together
andput in a little hard work...

 149 
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:55,337
...a new Frank could be
right around the corner.

 150 
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,107
Mr. Colonic? What's that smell?

 151 
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,976
That's the smell ofchange, Billy.

 152 
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,045
The smell ofchange.

 153 
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,609
Paid by Colonic for Mayor.

 154 
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:10,257
Can you believe those lies?

 155 
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:15,124
He's got a point. You promised
to focus on health issues.

 156 
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:16,457
l want health...

 157 
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,933
...but think of the sacrifices,
the hard work and lack of chips.

 158 
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:23,263
That's not what voters want.

 159 
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:26,911
-Why are you behind in the polls?
-Don't you worry.

 160 
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:30,479
l have a plan to flush Colonic
down the toilet.

 161 
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:32,982
Honey.

 162 
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:36,546
Shane.

 163 
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:39,724
Coming!

 164 
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:43,563
You okay? Where does it hurt?

 165 
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:45,721
Leg.

 166 
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:47,432
ls it here?

 167 
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,965
A leg.

 168 
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,138
Here?

 169 
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,400
Leg.

 170 
00:13:58,015 --> 00:13:59,141
Here.

 171 
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:05,885
l just needed some sodium.

 172 
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:08,422
That's what made me cramp up.

 173 
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:13,155
Heads up!

 174 
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:16,495
Chicken going down rough.
Going down rough.

 175 
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,802
Oh, now what?

 176 
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:24,208
Sir, turn on the optical feed.

 177 
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,542
Let me take a look, Dad.

 178 
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:30,875
Open wide.

 179 
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:33,216
Open wide.

 180 
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,785
Could you swallow first, please?

 181 
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:46,899
Definitely red.

 182 
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:52,342
Are you ordering out?

 183 
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,479
l'm making an appointment
with the doctor.

 184 
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:59,882
Sick? We're not getting sick!
We have far too much planned.

 185 
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:11,023
You can't override without
a vote from city council.

 186 
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:13,564
Yes, my dear.

 187 
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,701
Voice manual control on.

 188 
00:15:17,943 --> 00:15:22,313
-That's only for emergencies.
-Leah, this is an emergency.

 189 
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:24,074
On second thought...

 190 
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:26,013
On second thought...

 191 
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:29,883
-...I'll take a coldpill.
-...l'll take a cold pill.

 192 
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:34,929
Uh, sir?

 193 
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,589
Thank you. Get me the chief.
There's a good girl.

 194 
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,402
''Drixenol.''

 195 
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,282
Next.

 196 
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:03,725
l caught him with six micrograms
of adrenaline.

 197 
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:06,662
lt's not mine.
l swear, it's my cousin's.

 198 
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:11,932
Yeah, l never heard that one before.
Take him to lockdown. Next.

 199 
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:15,635
Hey, it's ''the Germinator!''

 200 
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:20,847
You got me there.
Save some for the criminals.

 201 
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:25,319
-You never catch anything, Jones.
-You should've seen this thing.

 202 
00:16:25,524 --> 00:16:27,492
lt's no ordinary germ.

 203 
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:30,629
This thing ain't even
from Frank's body.

 204 
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,095
This is like a Al Roker germ,
a Heavy D germ.

 205 
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,596
Talking about this?

 206 
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:43,035
Yeah, he's slouching right now.

 207 
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:44,541
ln my office!

 208 
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:49,712
-Chiefy-weefy, what's up?
-Don't ''chiefy-weefy'' me.

 209 
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,147
See the headlines?

 210 
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:56,156
The papers call it the most powerful
cramp since Shane made us try Tae-Bo!

 211 
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,092
-Hold on a second.
-l told you to wait for backup!

 212 
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:03,393
But again, you had to
do it your own way.

 213 
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:05,467
-Man, l could have--
-Right!

 214 
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:08,266
Trillions of cells
working together...

 215 
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:11,035
...you're the only one doing it alone.

 216 
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:13,406
That's your problem, Jones.

 217 
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:17,675
What?! Oh, hello, Mr. Mayor.
The missus? She's great, yes.

 218 
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:20,252
What? l'll put a man right on it.

 219 
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:23,323
Yes, sir.
Stupid political decisions.

 220 
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:24,686
Now where was l?

 221 
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:27,260
You said you were giving me...

 222 
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,456
...a promotion to
Head of Brain Security.

 223 
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:35,504
You know what? You're right.
Maybe it is time l give you a case.

 224 
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,271
Talking about what?

 225 
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:39,967
l'm putting you on a job
in the throat.

 226 
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:44,813
Thank you, chief. Thank you, chief.
You won't regret this.

 227 
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:47,987
You a good man.
You a upstanding man.

 228 
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:51,454
-Whatever.
-lt was on the fence for a while.

 229 
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:56,097
''Good man, bad man.''
Now it's official: You are a good man.

 230 
00:17:56,465 --> 00:18:00,368
You done? Now our pill
is getting swallowed as we speak.

 231 
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,937
So get your nucleus
down to the stomach, pronto.

 232 
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,869
Pill? What pill?

 233 
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:09,774
l wouldn't trust you to
handle a sore throat alone!

 234 
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:14,676
Get out. Or you're on butt-hair
patrol for the next three years!

 235 
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,734
Rinky-dink, stink, pinky pill.

 236 
00:18:29,137 --> 00:18:33,074
The white zone is for ingestion and
digestion only. No parking.

 237 
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:36,835
Peanut boarding
for intestine and liver...

 238 
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:40,546
... with direct service
to the colon.

 239 
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:42,217
Now boarding.

 240 
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:47,647
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna....

 241 
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,325
All right.

 242 
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,301
All fat cells
proceed to love handles.

 243 
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,275
Oh, yes, Mr. Mayor.

 244 
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,503
No, sir, it hasn't arrived yet.

 245 
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:09,811
What the--
Look out now.

 246 
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:17,424
Did you look at my notes
on your speech?

 247 
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:18,890
The in-box.

 248 
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:22,931
Yes, it says ''in'' on it, sir.
l'll check back later.

 249 
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,624
All right, goodbye.

 250 
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:29,433
Well, well, what do we have here?
Somebody been working out!

 251 
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:32,134
Leah, you looking fine.
Mighty fine.

 252 
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:35,747
Did they have to assign you to this?

 253 
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,113
Spit. Wasn't my idea,
but now l like it.

 254 
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,221
Baby, when are we hooking up?

 255 
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:44,950
l know a spot behind the eye,
has a perfect view.

 256 
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,325
Perfect for a little rendezvous
between me and you.

 257 
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:53,936
Do you know what l'm saying?
l been saying it a long time.

 258 
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:57,006
Why would l ever go out with you?

 259 
00:19:57,209 --> 00:20:01,236
What? l'm a legend!
The chicks line up to divide with me.

 260 
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:02,539
Oh, really?

 261 
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:06,047
You look like a cell
who divides with himself.

 262 
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:10,682
Who cut off the heat?
Somebody pay the bill! lt's cold.

 263 
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:15,920
Now arriving with some milk, a cold
pill with a pleasant fruity flavor.

 264 
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:21,363
Wow, this is huge.

 265 
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,938
Don't be all impressed.
lt's 99% sugar.

 266 
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,837
Yeah? And 99% of you is just stupid.

 267 
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:30,946
Like l haven't heard that one before.

 268 
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,922
What is that cherry stank?

 269 
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:48,096
Special agent
Drixobenzometaphedramine.

 270 
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:53,199
''The brand that eases
your coughs and sneezes.''

 271 
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:56,810
Don't exceed dosage.
lf symptoms persist, see a physician.

 272 
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:59,208
May cause drowsiness.
Do not operate machinery.

 273 
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:02,010
Pregnant women shouldn't handle pills.

 274 
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,652
l feel better already.

 275 
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:07,018
-You can call me ''Drix.''
-Welcome to Frank.

 276 
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,750
l'll examine your irritated areas.

 277 
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,089
Never on the first date, Drips.

 278 
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:13,788
-Drix.
-l said that.

 279 
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:17,527
-You said ''Drips'' with a ''p.''
-Whatever.

 280 
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:23,169
This ain't working. l'll ask
the chief to assign someone else.

 281 
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:24,366
Wait.

 282 
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:27,146
Hold up. l need this job, Leah.

 283 
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:29,408
Just give me a shot.

 284 
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:34,985
All right. But no screw-ups, you dig?

 285 
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:39,754
l promise everything will be fine.
Not as fine as you, but fine.

 286 
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,358
Man, what you been eating?

 287 
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,003
That's my effervescent propulsion.

 288 
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,438
We're driving with the windows open.

 289 
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,842
l don't want bubbles
stinking up my ride.

 290 
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,276
You got that?

 291 
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:01,120
Look what you're doing to my baby.

 292 
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:04,918
Don't touch my radio!

 293 
00:22:09,065 --> 00:22:10,464
Where you from?

 294 
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:14,160
The University of Chicago,
graduated Phi Beta Capsule.

 295 
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:17,136
Great, got me a college boy.

 296 
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:19,742
FDA-certified for colds and flu...

 297 
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:23,745
...and a master's in Symptom Relief.
Where'd you study?

 298 
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:28,853
l grew up on the wrong side of the
digestive tract. No fancy schools.

 299 
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,154
My high school was crack central.

 300 
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,361
No, it was in the crack!
Right in the stanky puckered center!

 301 
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:43,261
We lived on peanut butter
and cellulite sandwiches.

 302 
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:45,941
Ever blow-dry your hair with a fart?

 303 
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:48,407
-Okay, you were poor.
-You bet!

 304 
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:51,912
Ever make a snowman from paper
cling-ons? That's poor!

 305 
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:53,777
You'll make me vomit.

 306 
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:57,319
We couldn't afford vomit,
that's for rich folks.

 307 
00:22:57,523 --> 00:23:00,981
-I have to wipe my eyes.
-Wanna talk about wiping?

 308 
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:08,566
You're all new so follow my lead,
all right?

 309 
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:13,639
Wait up! Didn't they teach you
manners in that lvy League petri dish?

 310 
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:18,473
Murphy, it's flaring up again!
Give me a status on the pain relief.

 311 
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:21,645
Foreign substance in upper....

 312 
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:26,084
lnflammation and glandular swelling.
We meet again.

 313 
00:23:28,626 --> 00:23:30,821
Dougy-Doug, the firebug!

 314 
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:32,496
My boy is hot!

 315 
00:23:32,697 --> 00:23:36,190
Osmosis Jones.
Like l don't have enough problems?

 316 
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:38,871
Start redirecting traffic over there.

 317 
00:23:39,072 --> 00:23:42,098
l'm in charge of this
sore throat, baby.

 318 
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:45,643
-You're kidding me.
-No. Straight up. What we got?

 319 
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:47,781
lt's a routine sore throat.

 320 
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:51,384
Looks like a saliva boat
went haywire and crashed.

 321 
00:23:51,587 --> 00:23:54,113
Saliva boat? That's pretty unusual.

 322 
00:23:54,324 --> 00:23:56,792
lKnock down that hot spot, ladder team!

 323 
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,718
Step away.

 324 
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:04,195
The tamperproof seal is there
for your protection.

 325 
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,716
Not my suedes!

 326 
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,730
What the dilly?

 327 
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:18,753
Por favor, don't shoot!

 328 
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:22,587
La Muerte man esta aqui!.

 329 
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:24,423
He'll kill us, hombre!

 330 
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:27,828
Talk English, man.
We ain't on Telemundo here.

 331 
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:32,301
La Muerte Roja!
He's coming, man. l saw him.

 332 
00:25:32,506 --> 00:25:35,408
l saw him. l saw him!
La Muerte Roja--

 333 
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:40,405
When your body's full ofaches
A Drixenol is all it takes

 334 
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:43,279
Excuse me! What are you doing?

 335 
00:25:43,486 --> 00:25:45,478
l'm soothing the irritation.

 336 
00:25:45,823 --> 00:25:49,122
You just soothed my witness
into a germ-cicle.

 337 
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:53,859
Don't worry, he'll be normal
in a few days.

 338 
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:55,498
That's too late.

 339 
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,499
He has information on what went down.

 340 
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:01,936
Nothing ''went down.''
lt's a common sore throat.

 341 
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:04,337
This is a crime scene.

 342 
00:26:09,017 --> 00:26:12,818
Want to be useful? Plug some
Turtle Wax into that thing...

 343 
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:14,887
...and wash my car!

 344 
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:19,426
Now that's inflammation relief.

 345 
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:21,119
Later, Doug.

 346 
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,323
Be cool, Oz.

 347 
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:35,543
How's it feel working with
the two dumbest animals in the zoo?

 348 
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,851
-Not bad.
-lt's okay.

 349 
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:41,453
l'm talking to the camels.

 350 
00:26:45,593 --> 00:26:47,959
They're talking to the camels.

 351 
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:50,222
Excellent.

 352 
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,838
l'm so psyched for this long weekend.

 353 
00:26:56,273 --> 00:26:57,706
Getting out of town?

 354 
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,003
l'm not getting out of my bathrobe.

 355 
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,240
l'll get a keg and plop myself down
on the sofa in front of the TV.

 356 
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:09,216
Some quality time
with the wife and kids.

 357 
00:27:12,192 --> 00:27:13,750
What's that smell?

 358 
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:17,791
That's Bruno. His tummy's still upset.

 359 
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:22,965
No, l'm talking about that
nasty, skanky, sweaty smell.

 360 
00:27:23,405 --> 00:27:26,375
Shane won't buy me deodorant anymore.

 361 
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:28,806
She says it causes cancer.

 362 
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,294
Did the foot fungus pay up yet?

 363 
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,126
No, that guy's getting flaky on us.

 364 
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:52,034
You ain't going to collect
nothing from him up here in the pit.

 365 
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,971
Now get down there,
send him a message.

 366 
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:06,019
So, this is where the scum of Frank
comes to fester.

 367 
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:11,354
Hey, you lost, pal? This is
a private sweat gland. Now beat it!

 368 
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:16,125
l'm looking for volunteers. Some
germs who want in on a big score.

 369 
00:28:17,402 --> 00:28:22,431
Yo, Red, we run the rackets here.
Take your hustle someplace else.

 370 
00:28:22,642 --> 00:28:24,770
This ain't about no hustle.

 371 
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:27,947
This is about the baddest illness
you've ever seen.

 372 
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:31,209
Look who thinks he's
the Ebola virus, huh?

 373 
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,557
Ebola?

 374 
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,889
Let me tell you something
about Ebola, baby.

 375 
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:43,395
Ebola is a case of dandruff
compared to me!

 376 
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,297
All right, pal. You're out of here.

 377 
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:50,498
Bruiser, take him to the face
and bury him in a blackhead.

 378 
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:55,204
lt'll take a Swedish facialist
and six steaming washcloths...

 379 
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:56,848
...to get you out!

 380 
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,019
Sounds like a gas, baby. Bring it on.

 381 
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:09,225
Bruiser! What are you? A sissy Mary?

 382 
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:10,825
What are you doing?

 383 
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:13,001
Che fa? What's he doing?

 384 
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:26,573
You ain't so tough, huh?
That was nothing.

 385 
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,485
So, uh...

 386 
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:32,556
...what kind of sickness
do you have in mind...

 387 
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:35,989
-...boss?
-Deadly.

 388 
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,392
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Uncle Bob.

 389 
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:43,603
Hello, beautiful.

 390 
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:46,535
l stopped by the camping store...

 391 
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:49,541
...and l got some stuff for the hike.

 392 
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:55,783
Right. On this hike, is that
teacher of yours going to be there?

 393 
00:29:57,288 --> 00:29:59,587
Yeah, my whole class is.
Why?

 394 
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:03,217
l was thinking l might
take a rain check.

 395 
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:06,959
Mrs. Boyd isn't still mad at you.

 396 
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,032
l didn't think so.
We could do something better.

 397 
00:30:12,406 --> 00:30:16,776
Yesterday, without thinking,
l did all my hiking for the week.

 398 
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:20,676
l hiked to the liquor store,
the cigarette warehouse....

 399 
00:30:20,883 --> 00:30:24,216
-But, Dad, you said--
-l said l'd think about it.

 400 
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,152
lt's a holiday weekend.
lt's important to be together.

 401 
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,824
Yeah, l guess you're right.

 402 
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:38,560
Well, l have something special
up my sleeve.

 403 
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,304
Have you ever seen a rattlesnake
swallow a football?

 404 
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,104
l don't think she has.

 405 
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:48,781
lt's fun. Come on.

 406 
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:53,284
-Come on. l'll show you.
-Thank you, Uncle Bob.

 407 
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:56,519
You're gonna love it!

 408 
00:31:01,197 --> 00:31:03,132
Why are we wasting time here?

 409 
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,325
l am on a 1 2-hour
time release program.

 410 
00:31:06,536 --> 00:31:10,098
-Throat, nose, then aches and pains.
-l got it.

 411 
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:13,176
Real important stuff.
Wait in the car.

 412 
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,779
l got police work to do.

 413 
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:19,281
One glazed and one
with a jelly-filled nucleus.

 414 
00:31:21,388 --> 00:31:23,619
Brain memory library.

 415 
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:26,918
You got any information
on something called...

 416 
00:31:27,128 --> 00:31:29,495
-... ''El Morry Roho''?
-Stand by.

 417 
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:33,931
l'll check, but we're really
all about sports statistics here.

 418 
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:38,371
-Sir?
-l'm here.

 419 
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:41,635
-What you got?
-''La Muerte Roja'' is Spanish.

 420 
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:44,815
-It means ''The Red Death. ''
-The Red Death?

 421 
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:48,508
-ls that some taco sauce?
-You have a nice day.

 422 
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:56,723
Yo, Drips!

 423 
00:31:58,498 --> 00:32:00,899
You ever hear of The Red Death?

 424 
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,339
Look alive, boys.
Dust at nine o'clock.

 425 
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,687
Eat hot nose juice, dust.

 426 
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:03,073
-We're here. You happy?
-Hear that?

 427 
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:05,504
Quick! The dam is under attack!

 428 
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:07,509
Hey, chill, pill!

 429 
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:10,479
Snot guns are booger-coating
some dust.

 430 
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:29,231
Now, get to work!

 431 
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:33,409
This is your big plan?
A sore throat? A stuffy nose?

 432 
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,809
-People will think you're--
-A common cold.

 433 
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:41,215
Until l make my move,
that's precisely what l want.

 434 
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:44,049
Yo, check it out. We got cops here!

 435 
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:45,417
Hey, look.

 436 
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:51,231
Be careful! That's a pollen pod.
Frank is allergic to this stuff.

 437 
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:54,732
-l didn't know he had allergies.
-Of course not.

 438 
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:59,605
Pills know nothing
about what goes on in here.

 439 
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:05,777
ln the words of the immortal
James Brown, get down!

 440 
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:07,042
James who?

 441 
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,268
-Hey, Frank.
-Danny.

 442 
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,066
Nitwit!

 443 
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:30,268
You could've damaged the dam!

 444 
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:34,678
Relax, this baby was built to last.
Solid cartilage.

 445 
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:39,016
You're an engineer now.
l need to test the mucous viscosity.

 446 
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,284
Frank! Why are you leaving so early?

 447 
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:49,491
lt's all shoveled. Hippo's asleep.
l'm taking Shane to Docky's.

 448 
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:53,263
-Did you think of something?
-Yeah, l did great.

 449 
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:58,935
l guarantee you there ain't
nothing wrong with this dam.

 450 
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:02,711
So you want me to take care of them?

 451 
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:07,618
No. Hit all the pressure valves.
They're about to blow the scene.

 452 
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:18,632
What in the name of sweet
bleeding Frank?!

 453 
00:35:18,836 --> 00:35:21,863
The membrane is cracking, you--

 454 
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:51,769
-You missed a spot!
-Come on, fellas. Go!

 455 
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:54,275
-Let's get out of here!
-Stop!

 456 
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:55,639
lmmunity!

 457 
00:35:55,847 --> 00:35:57,144
What the Frank?

 458 
00:36:01,821 --> 00:36:03,380
Wait a minute!

 459 
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,550
Nose hairs!

 460 
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,489
Watch out!

 461 
00:36:37,897 --> 00:36:39,262
Look out!

 462 
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:46,504
We're going to die!

 463 
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:52,772
l'm standing here.
Can you use a tissue?

 464 
00:36:52,982 --> 00:36:56,009
-l don't have one.
-Use your imagination.

 465 
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:57,720
What's that there?

 466 
00:37:03,728 --> 00:37:04,729
-Better?
-Much better.

 467 
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:05,161
-Better?
-Much better.

 468 
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:09,425
l gotta go get her. She'll be
excited and probably call you.

 469 
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:15,241
lf not for you, none of this
would have ever happened.

 470 
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,206
lf you'll excuse me, l...

 471 
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:19,572
...have a nose to dry.

 472 
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:26,619
This is Nerve Network News. NNN.

 473 
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,864
ln an act of selfless bravery,
a cold tablet stopped a runny nose.

 474 
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:38,968
The heroic tablet will be
honored this afternoon.

 475 
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,398
Trudy?

 476 
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:44,940
ln lighter news, there was pandemonium
in the stomach today...

 477 
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:46,941
...as animal crackers arrived.

 478 
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:49,445
They are adorable, aren't they?

 479 
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:54,710
Now, we go live to Cerebellum Hall for
an address from Mayor Phlegmming.

 480 
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:56,389
Okay, Mayor.

 481 
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:59,720
ln five, four, three....

 482 
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:04,490
Good evening, citizens of Frank.
ln the past few weeks...

 483 
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:09,297
...my opponent has used fancy words
to try to confuse the issues.

 484 
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:14,103
Words like ''exercise,''
''low-fat,'' and ''diet.''

 485 
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:19,682
Words designed to scare us into
changing what has worked for years.

 486 
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:24,013
Well, l say let's stay the course.

 487 
00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:27,591
Remember, a fat Frank
is a happy Frank.

 488 
00:38:27,794 --> 00:38:29,625
That's not what l wrote.

 489 
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,131
l propose something that every
organism in this city will enjoy.

 490 
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:35,893
l give you...

 491 
00:38:36,104 --> 00:38:40,508
...a dream vacation to
the annual chicken wing festival...

 492 
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:42,575
...in Buffalo, New York.

 493 
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:51,453
Final plans have been made and nothing
is going to stand in our way.

 494 
00:38:52,491 --> 00:38:53,822
And we're out.

 495 
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,164
-That wasn't the speech we agreed on.
-Where's the twerp in the wheelchair?

 496 
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:02,334
Hello, Johnny. How you doing?

 497 
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:07,330
Congratulations. Excellent work
in the nose. Let's get some pictures.

 498 
00:39:08,076 --> 00:39:11,944
The caption should read,
''Mayor and Pill Stop Cold...Cold.''

 499 
00:39:12,147 --> 00:39:16,949
Mr. Mayor? Excuse me, sir,
but we have a problem.

 500 
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:18,513
Now what, Jones?

 501 
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:22,419
Whatever was in the sinuses
is a lot more than a cold.

 502 
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:26,927
Don't listen to Jones. His diagnostic
skills are remedial at best!

 503 
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,033
You iced a key witness
to a viral attack!

 504 
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:31,498
lt was an accident!

 505 
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,640
The kind a time-release dipstick
would have.

 506 
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:38,538
l am sick of you!
That's it, l can't work with him!

 507 
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:40,771
l can't work with you!

 508 
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:42,381
Officers, please.

 509 
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:47,521
-Jones, what's this virus?
-The virus that torched the throat.

 510 
00:39:47,723 --> 00:39:50,557
lt caused those snot crests
l was surfing!

 511 
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,457
They were caused by the sneeze,
which you caused.

 512 
00:39:54,664 --> 00:39:58,157
Then why was that
viral-looking mother fleeing?

 513 
00:39:58,936 --> 00:40:01,428
We should put the city on full alert.

 514 
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,701
-Liquids, bed rest. Just to be safe.
-We'll do no such thing.

 515 
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:11,350
l won't listen to the white blood cell
with the worst record in Frank.

 516 
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:14,714
lKeep those opinions
in that mushy head...

 517 
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:19,222
...or you'll find yourself
in our next nosebleed. Understood?

 518 
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,757
Son, l apologize for all this.

 519 
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:26,230
Now, why don't we find you
another...

 520 
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:27,733
...more capable officer to work with.

 521 
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:31,868
Sir, if it's all the same to you...

 522 
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:34,372
...l think l'll stay with Jones.

 523 
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:41,106
Suit yourself.

 524 
00:40:45,155 --> 00:40:48,956
You didn't have to do that.
l don't need your sympathy.

 525 
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,650
lt's not sympathy.

 526 
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:54,822
l'm here to make Frank feel better.
lf this alleged virus...

 527 
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:57,525
...impedes my mission,
l must pursue it.

 528 
00:40:57,737 --> 00:41:00,002
Yeah, whatever.

 529 
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:04,703
What did the mayor mean by ''record''?

 530 
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,674
You did something terrible,
didn't you?

 531 
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:12,750
Sometimes being too careful
is all it takes.

 532 
00:41:12,955 --> 00:41:13,944
How so?

 533 
00:41:14,156 --> 00:41:18,719
l was cruising the digestive tract,
just minding my own business.

 534 
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:24,160
Outside was Shane's science fair.
Everyone was excited.

 535 
00:41:24,368 --> 00:41:28,328
The winner would get their picture
in the localpaper.

 536 
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,877
-Think they'll like my volcano?
-All the parents are going home sad.

 537 
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:38,982
Their kids' projects are cardboard
and glitter paint and science.

 538 
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:41,121
Shane, yours is art.

 539 
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:45,021
-Wow, what a great tepee.
-Tepee?

 540 
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:47,694
Mrs. Delirious, come on.

 541 
00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:53,298
l'll check the competition. Try and
learn them something about volcanos.

 542 
00:41:58,276 --> 00:42:00,267
Partner, what you got there?

 543 
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:04,779
These are polluted oysters.
Well, they were polluted.

 544 
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:09,581
l replanted them six months ago.
That's how long the state says.

 545 
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:12,622
Every time the tide came in,
they'd flush...

 546 
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:14,624
...all the bad stuff out.

 547 
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:17,396
Can you eat them?

 548 
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:21,666
Well, if my hypotenuse is correct,
sure.

 549 
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,906
Yeah, definitely.

 550 
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:27,337
You got yourself a sale.

 551 
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:42,861
You should check your math
on that one.

 552 
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:48,593
I was in the kidneys
while a 6-31 was in progress.

 553 
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:52,933
That's incoming shellfiish.
I went to the stomach, to be safe.

 554 
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:56,509
Unscheduled shellfiish
now arriving at gate six.

 555 
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,670
And you must be Shane's dad.

 556 
00:42:59,882 --> 00:43:02,443
Guilty as charged. Frank Detorre.

 557 
00:43:02,652 --> 00:43:05,246
Pleasure to meet you.
l am Mrs. Boyd.

 558 
00:43:05,455 --> 00:43:08,118
l am Shane's science and PE teacher.

 559 
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:11,989
l am just absolutely crazy
about your daughter.

 560 
00:43:12,197 --> 00:43:13,289
She is a doll.

 561 
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:16,297
lf you mean that, l'll keep her.

 562 
00:43:23,677 --> 00:43:25,542
Oh, my God.

 563 
00:43:27,415 --> 00:43:29,883
That is so funny!

 564 
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:33,488
Oh, my God, l got the giggles.

 565 
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,820
She's a sweetie-pie.

 566 
00:43:37,093 --> 00:43:41,690
She wants to go to the city
and help people someday.

 567 
00:43:42,065 --> 00:43:45,502
No kidding.
You mean like a concierge?

 568 
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:48,332
No, like, poor people.

 569 
00:43:49,174 --> 00:43:50,903
Yeah, she told me that.

 570 
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:55,444
Frank, it's so wonderful to see...

 571 
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:58,675
...Shane participating
in the science fair.

 572 
00:43:58,953 --> 00:44:03,447
Since her mother passed away,
she's had a really hard time...

 573 
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:06,285
...being part of the group activities.

 574 
00:44:06,762 --> 00:44:08,787
She's going to be okay.

 575 
00:44:13,803 --> 00:44:15,294
And then I saw him.

 576 
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:19,398
He was on the clammiest oyster
l'd ever seen.

 577 
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:24,112
Mr. Detorre?

 578 
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,276
Are you okay?

 579 
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:33,725
Those oysters.

 580 
00:44:34,494 --> 00:44:38,454
The oysters?
Oh, yeah, that's Zach's project.

 581 
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,966
He's a little slow.

 582 
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:45,239
The doctor says he has a brain
the size of a tangerine.

 583 
00:44:47,377 --> 00:44:50,778
We gave him this project
to push him along.

 584 
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,314
He just started it this morning,
which is funny.

 585 
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:56,855
We'll give him an 'A' anyway.

 586 
00:44:56,855 --> 00:44:57,514
We'll give him an 'A' anyway.

 587 
00:44:58,123 --> 00:44:59,112
Mr. Detorre?

 588 
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:10,803
There was no time for questions.
I did what I had to do.

 589 
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:13,600
Look at that guy!

 590 
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:27,923
You can guess which photo
made it to the paper the next day.

 591 
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:31,253
Overnight, Frank became
the town laughingstock.

 592 
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:35,593
The photo ran in every daily
across the country.

 593 
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:39,101
He got fiired from his job
at the pea soup factory.

 594 
00:45:39,305 --> 00:45:43,264
Lucky for us, Bob hooked up
Frank with ajob at the zoo.

 595 
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:48,039
It was a 90% cut in pay,
but it was the best we could do.

 596 
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:51,777
Needless to say,
none of this helped Shane.

 597 
00:45:52,087 --> 00:45:55,956
And as for me, l got suspended
for unnecessary force.

 598 
00:45:56,158 --> 00:45:59,025
Since then, every day l wonder:

 599 
00:45:59,228 --> 00:46:01,322
''Did l do the right thing?''

 600 
00:46:01,565 --> 00:46:05,297
From the description,
it sounds like you were justified.

 601 
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:06,692
Excuse me?

 602 
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:10,033
Oysters are filled
with dangerous bacteria.

 603 
00:46:10,241 --> 00:46:13,040
l've been trying to tell everybody!

 604 
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:18,377
-I never thought you'd be on my side.
-I never thought you'd be right.

 605 
00:46:21,689 --> 00:46:25,216
Sir, we have a strict
no-shoes-no-service policy.

 606 
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:26,860
You have to leave.

 607 
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:30,225
ls that how you treat
the handicapped?

 608 
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:32,792
Handicap?

 609 
00:46:33,036 --> 00:46:36,699
l have a chronic
ingrown-toe condition.

 610 
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:40,536
Doctors say that soon
l won't be able to wear...

 611 
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:44,704
-...even the roomiest of footwear.
-l'll bring your menus.

 612 
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:48,318
Bring some clam strips
and some steamers...

 613 
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:50,489
...when you come, please?

 614 
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,818
What's the big surprise?

 615 
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:58,295
l know you wanted to go
on a trip this weekend, so....

 616 
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:03,794
Buffalo?

 617 
00:47:04,006 --> 00:47:06,497
Buffalo, New York.

 618 
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:09,745
The buffalo wing festival
this weekend.

 619 
00:47:11,614 --> 00:47:14,140
Great. So, what's the big surprise?

 620 
00:47:14,485 --> 00:47:17,613
We got tickets!
l called a scalper!

 621 
00:47:17,855 --> 00:47:18,981
Look.

 622 
00:47:19,558 --> 00:47:21,856
Ninety-nine kinds of wings.

 623 
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:26,259
One hundred and twenty-eight
different dipping sauces.

 624 
00:47:26,466 --> 00:47:29,299
You love math.
Crunch the numbers on that.

 625 
00:47:29,502 --> 00:47:32,097
The possibilities are infinite.

 626 
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:34,570
Look! Here you are.

 627 
00:47:34,775 --> 00:47:36,971
Ms. Chicken Wing Festival.

 628 
00:47:39,814 --> 00:47:41,146
See this?

 629 
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:45,417
He's the champion.
But he won't be for long.

 630 
00:47:45,622 --> 00:47:50,355
Because l'm coming.
l'm coming to get you, baby. Fun?

 631 
00:47:51,696 --> 00:47:54,631
Yeah, that's really cool, Dad.

 632 
00:47:54,832 --> 00:47:57,267
See, l told you she'd be excited.

 633 
00:47:57,469 --> 00:47:59,164
Now, tidy up, will you?

 634 
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:12,518
Okay, Frank. This is your conscience
speaking. Now listen carefully.

 635 
00:48:12,988 --> 00:48:16,651
This hiking trip means
a lot to her. Make it work.

 636 
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,360
Use that charm.

 637 
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:23,165
What's wrong now?

 638 
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,468
Oh, jeez.
Oh, it's this damn toe.

 639 
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,333
Do me a favor, huh?

 640 
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:32,270
Don't you get old.

 641 
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,509
Listen to the toe.
Don't you get old.

 642 
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:47,692
Boss, your plan worked.

 643 
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:51,764
That's right. l got this city
exactly where l want it.

 644 
00:48:53,435 --> 00:48:58,100
-What about the cop and the pill?
-lf they give us a problem:

 645 
00:48:58,341 --> 00:49:00,367
Fire!

 646 
00:49:10,123 --> 00:49:14,150
Get it down! Money on the wood
make the game go good.

 647 
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,023
Five bucks says size don't matter.

 648 
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,302
Let's do this thing now.

 649 
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:25,969
-Chicken-pock fights.
-Get back!

 650 
00:49:26,475 --> 00:49:28,067
Yeah, get him!

 651 
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:30,939
That's my baby! Try the headlock!

 652 
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:34,584
-See that dude?
-A virus! We should arrest him!

 653 
00:49:34,784 --> 00:49:38,186
No, that used to be a virus,
now he's on our side.

 654 
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:41,985
-That's Chill. He's a flu shot.
-He doesn't look fluish.

 655 
00:49:42,194 --> 00:49:45,960
Just stay here and watch
the maestro work.

 656 
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:48,266
Yo, Chill! Chill!

 657 
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:51,096
Pock fights are against the law.

 658 
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:53,773
Where you all going?

 659 
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:57,536
Thanks a lot, junior.
You just cost me twenty.

 660 
00:49:57,746 --> 00:50:02,183
Money won't be your problem if
you don't tell me about the sinuses.

 661 
00:50:02,384 --> 00:50:06,219
l was injected into this body
to rat on influenza only.

 662 
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:10,553
And this don't sound
like influenza to me. Now beat it.

 663 
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:14,892
l bet Johnny Streptococcus and the
Melanoma family will be interested...

 664 
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:17,192
...to hear about your work.

 665 
00:50:17,402 --> 00:50:22,466
You can't jack me on that, brother!
l'm in the virus protection program.

 666 
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:27,010
You, virus. Children's strength
ought to take care of you.

 667 
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,939
You done done it now, Chill.
He's a psycho cop.

 668 
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:33,245
lt's too late to spill it.

 669 
00:50:33,454 --> 00:50:37,152
Just off the Thorazine.
He's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

 670 
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,091
He's going El Pollo Loco
on your crazy behind.

 671 
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:43,891
l just can't look.

 672 
00:50:44,234 --> 00:50:45,224
All right!

 673 
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:52,302
The guy's big time.
He goes by the name of Thrax.

 674 
00:50:52,544 --> 00:50:55,479
Go to that new place.
The Zit, on the head.

 675 
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:59,344
You can't miss it. lt's huge.
They're meeting tonight.

 676 
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:00,541
l'm out.

 677 
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:06,226
But you didn't hear that from me.
You didn't hear that from me.

 678 
00:51:07,528 --> 00:51:09,928
Next time, l'll be the bad cop.

 679 
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:11,793
You are a bad cop.

 680 
00:51:12,701 --> 00:51:14,669
Who you calling a bad cop?

 681 
00:51:29,788 --> 00:51:33,316
My, what big zits he has.
How does this happen?

 682 
00:51:33,526 --> 00:51:36,086
You wash your face
with fried chicken.

 683 
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:43,895
Wait. Where do you think you're going?

 684 
00:51:44,105 --> 00:51:46,335
-To get our cootie.
-Like that?

 685 
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:50,069
-They'll tear you up. Get spiffy.
-Spiffy?

 686 
00:52:02,694 --> 00:52:04,993
Peep this. Check it out.

 687 
00:52:05,197 --> 00:52:09,692
Pliable cellular dynamics.
What an ingenious defense mechanism.

 688 
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:11,834
Ooh, let me try.

 689 
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,404
What do you think?

 690 
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:19,908
You should guard the car.

 691 
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:24,152
This is my mission too.
l am going in with you.

 692 
00:52:24,353 --> 00:52:27,881
All right. But we gotta
get you something to wear.

 693 
00:52:34,031 --> 00:52:35,931
You sure this is working?

 694 
00:52:36,134 --> 00:52:38,500
Trust me, it's perfect.

 695 
00:52:38,703 --> 00:52:39,692
Perfect.

 696 
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,454
We got company. Be cool.

 697 
00:52:59,294 --> 00:53:03,891
Now, try to relax. Fit in.
Shake a tail cell or something.

 698 
00:53:04,968 --> 00:53:07,368
l don't dance.
l have no left feet.

 699 
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:08,936
You don't dance?

 700 
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,769
Don't tell me you ain't
never gotten jiggy with it.

 701 
00:53:12,978 --> 00:53:15,037
l don't believe l have.

 702 
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:18,308
Come on, baby, give me
a little bit of this.

 703 
00:53:18,885 --> 00:53:19,874
Oh, all right.

 704 
00:53:20,453 --> 00:53:22,819
-Here you go.
-That's it, baby.

 705 
00:53:23,022 --> 00:53:26,117
-Get down.
-Don't let it settle at the bottom.

 706 
00:53:27,694 --> 00:53:29,253
Oh, mama. Yo!

 707 
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,864
You stay and practice.
Boy, you need it.

 708 
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:41,475
lf l'm not back in five,
you come looking, okay?

 709 
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:21,883
Barkeep, what you got?

 710 
00:54:29,268 --> 00:54:34,502
-You got a problem with that?
-No. lt's just the way l like it:

 711 
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:37,438
Extra disgusting.

 712 
00:55:01,373 --> 00:55:04,901
Three teams will move through
the cranial artery...

 713 
00:55:05,111 --> 00:55:07,773
...and one through
the nasal passages.

 714 
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,441
We are going to the brain, baby.
And we are stealing one of these.

 715 
00:55:12,653 --> 00:55:16,852
This sucker comes from a place
called the hypothalamus gland.

 716 
00:55:18,459 --> 00:55:21,918
Hypothalamus. Hypothalamus.

 717 
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:24,793
Controls the temperature for the body.

 718 
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:28,596
We are going to march in
and take the prize.

 719 
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:32,637
Frank's gonna heat up
like a sidewalk on a summer day.

 720 
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,213
Go away.

 721 
00:55:46,025 --> 00:55:47,960
l need to talk to you.

 722 
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:55,627
What a zit!

 723 
00:55:56,171 --> 00:55:58,140
What is it? What do you want?

 724 
00:55:59,075 --> 00:56:01,236
l want you to help me.

 725 
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:03,577
Should l call the cops?

 726 
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:08,544
Or maybe Shane should know
about the 200-yard restraining order.

 727 
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:12,554
Please. She's been
humiliated enough already.

 728 
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:14,881
Humiliated.

 729 
00:56:15,094 --> 00:56:18,724
You turned me into
a walking air-sickness bag.

 730 
00:56:18,932 --> 00:56:21,867
My family was humiliated.
You understand?

 731 
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:24,560
Do you have any idea
of the teasing...

 732 
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:28,003
...that my sons, Ralph and Chuck,
had to endure?

 733 
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:32,302
l know your daughter Hurly
had to transfer.

 734 
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,073
Her name is Shirley.

 735 
00:56:34,784 --> 00:56:36,809
That is much prettier.

 736 
00:56:37,587 --> 00:56:40,785
-Tom Brokaw called her Hurly.
-What?

 737 
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:43,016
But it was a cute picture.

 738 
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:48,495
We gotta get this water underneath
our bridge, for Shane's sake.

 739 
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,728
l would never hold anything
against one of my students.

 740 
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,071
Get back to work!

 741 
00:56:56,877 --> 00:57:00,780
-Be prepared. lt's going down tonight.
-Tonight?

 742 
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:04,281
Me and Madcow
are going to Wrestlemania.

 743 
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:05,976
See this?

 744 
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:10,524
This DNA bead comes from a girl
in Riverside, California.

 745 
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:14,993
Didn't like to wash her hands.
Took me three whole weeks.

 746 
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:18,794
And this one.
Nice lady in Detroit, Motown.

 747 
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:20,493
Six days flat.

 748 
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:23,297
Then there's this old guy in Philly.

 749 
00:57:23,675 --> 00:57:26,804
l killed him in seventy-two hours.

 750 
00:57:27,013 --> 00:57:31,815
l'm getting better as l go, but
the problem is l never set a record.

 751 
00:57:32,052 --> 00:57:34,179
Until my man Frank, that is.

 752 
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:39,121
l'll take him down in 48 hours.
Get my chapter in the medical books.

 753 
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,426
Excuse me. Excuse me.
l got one more question here.

 754 
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:50,595
Could a white blood cell
do anything to stop this evil plan?

 755 
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:54,141
You know, hypothetically speaking,
that is.

 756 
00:57:54,712 --> 00:57:58,945
-And, who are you?
-Who am l? Who am l?

 757 
00:57:59,785 --> 00:58:04,587
A bad, booty-shaking pickinosis.
Yeah. That's who l am.

 758 
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:07,521
-Never heard of you.
-You just got here.

 759 
00:58:07,727 --> 00:58:11,164
But ask any of them,
when it comes to illing...

 760 
00:58:11,365 --> 00:58:15,097
...bad, booty-shaking pickinosis
stands above the rest.

 761 
00:58:15,303 --> 00:58:17,430
Oh, that hurts.

 762 
00:58:18,673 --> 00:58:19,971
That ain't no germ.

 763 
00:58:20,176 --> 00:58:21,905
That's a cop.

 764 
00:58:23,112 --> 00:58:28,346
Well, what do we have here?
An officer of Frank's finest.

 765 
00:58:28,552 --> 00:58:32,455
Somebody lay down a towel.
This is going to be messy.

 766 
00:58:34,392 --> 00:58:37,362
Attention, germs. You are surrounded.

 767 
00:58:39,398 --> 00:58:40,387
Surrounded.

 768 
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,125
Yo, Hammer. You can stop dancing.

 769 
00:58:49,477 --> 00:58:50,466
What kept you?

 770 
00:58:52,548 --> 00:58:54,015
Es el muerte rojo!

 771 
00:58:54,216 --> 00:58:56,515
No me mates!
Get out of here!

 772 
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:59,153
Please lift the restraining order...

 773 
00:58:59,355 --> 00:59:02,018
...so l can do this
father-daughter trip.

 774 
00:59:02,226 --> 00:59:04,217
The answer is no.

 775 
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:06,353
Please.

 776 
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,395
Think about it overnight.

 777 
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:17,105
lt would make a little girl
very happy.

 778 
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:23,878
Only for use against
the most stubborn cold symptoms.

 779 
00:59:26,454 --> 00:59:28,616
-Childproof caps.
-Get him!

 780 
00:59:36,933 --> 00:59:38,663
Why you hit so hard?

 781 
00:59:44,176 --> 00:59:47,168
Drix, l could use a little help here.

 782 
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:48,368
Give me that.

 783 
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:58,590
Oh, no. Not again.

 784 
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:10,337
You have something white on your lips.

 785 
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:13,503
Other side.

 786 
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:20,744
Get out!

 787 
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,212
Out!

 788 
01:00:22,421 --> 01:00:26,756
The answer is no! Absolutely not!

 789 
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:37,196
Thanks. You saved my cytoplasm
in there.

 790 
01:00:41,076 --> 01:00:43,477
Mr. Thrax has left the building.

 791 
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,884
Let's call for a scab
and get to the precinct.

 792 
01:00:57,095 --> 01:00:59,564
Jones! In my offiice.

 793 
01:01:00,132 --> 01:01:04,194
Hey, hey, who died?
Other than Thrax, that is. Brandy!

 794 
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:08,238
-l mean, Leah. Why are you here?
-You really did it now.

 795 
01:01:08,443 --> 01:01:13,176
-l didn't see you back there.
-Disregarding orders, destruction...

 796 
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:17,682
...popping a pimple without a permit!
What were you doing there?

 797 
01:01:17,886 --> 01:01:21,618
-Promoting good health, sir.
-ls that what you call it?

 798 
01:01:21,825 --> 01:01:24,590
He was lethal.
lf we hadn't stopped him--

 799 
01:01:24,795 --> 01:01:29,289
-We'd be frying eggs off of Frank!
-Watch it, you'll cause a panic.

 800 
01:01:29,501 --> 01:01:33,267
People would think
about what's going on in this body...

 801 
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:34,872
...not the stupid trip!

 802 
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:39,443
Okay, you want us to start thinking?
Well, here's a thought:

 803 
01:01:39,645 --> 01:01:41,079
You're fired.

 804 
01:01:41,648 --> 01:01:43,809
-Mr. Mayor--
-Your badge, mister.

 805 
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:48,756
Figures. l finally do something right
for Frank, and l get fired.

 806 
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:56,265
Without him, Frank could've been
in mortal danger.

 807 
01:01:56,466 --> 01:02:01,096
Mortal danger? You'd love to prove
that, wouldn't you, Mr. Drixenol?

 808 
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:04,638
Get your name in the
New England Journal ofMedicine.

 809 
01:02:04,842 --> 01:02:08,108
Son, read what it says on your arm.

 810 
01:02:08,313 --> 01:02:11,043
''For the temporary relief
of symptoms--''

 811 
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,448
Exactly. Temporary.

 812 
01:02:14,654 --> 01:02:16,645
You're a wannabe. A placebo.

 813 
01:02:16,856 --> 01:02:20,850
A generic brand.
An over-the-counter Tic-Tac.

 814 
01:02:21,495 --> 01:02:24,329
Now, get out of my body!

 815 
01:02:28,604 --> 01:02:31,198
Continuing symptoms,
while annoying...

 816 
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:35,208
... will not derailplans
for the trip to the annual...

 817 
01:02:35,412 --> 01:02:37,539
...chicken wing festival.

 818 
01:02:39,951 --> 01:02:42,419
-What's so funny?
-l don't know.

 819 
01:02:43,756 --> 01:02:46,782
They're making this too easy.

 820 
01:02:48,427 --> 01:02:52,125
You know, no one has ever
gotten wise to me...

 821 
01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:54,301
...and now for the first time...

 822 
01:02:54,502 --> 01:02:57,869
...an immunity cell
has figured out everything...

 823 
01:02:58,072 --> 01:03:00,064
...and they don't believe him.

 824 
01:03:02,744 --> 01:03:05,646
Can you taste the irony in that?

 825 
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:10,046
Shut up! What are you two laughing at?

 826 
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:13,616
We're back on schedule.

 827 
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:16,890
But boss, we're the only ones left.

 828 
01:03:17,095 --> 01:03:20,258
Maybe we should incubate for a while?

 829 
01:03:21,534 --> 01:03:23,092
You incubate.

 830 
01:03:23,302 --> 01:03:26,067
l'm going to make my deadline.

 831 
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:31,274
Medical books aren't written
about losers.

 832 
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:38,485
l'm not going.

 833 
01:03:39,688 --> 01:03:44,388
-You're not going where, hon?
-To Buffalo. l'm not going.

 834 
01:03:46,563 --> 01:03:50,728
Honey, we're all packed.
Buffalo's going to be a blast.

 835 
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,665
l'm going camping with my friends.

 836 
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:56,704
You're welcome to join us.

 837 
01:03:57,009 --> 01:03:59,501
Well, l don't think....

 838 
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,771
l'd really like you to come.

 839 
01:04:03,517 --> 01:04:06,918
You don't want me
huffing and puffing after you.

 840 
01:04:07,121 --> 01:04:08,749
You want to go, okay.

 841 
01:04:08,957 --> 01:04:11,482
Uncle Bob will go with me to Buffalo.

 842 
01:04:13,996 --> 01:04:16,658
l'm tired of this. lt's not fair.

 843 
01:04:16,866 --> 01:04:19,597
l go where you want.
l eat what you want.

 844 
01:04:19,803 --> 01:04:22,601
Don't you ever think
about anyone else?

 845 
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,238
l think about you.

 846 
01:04:25,643 --> 01:04:29,580
Like when you packed me
a fried Slim Jim sandwich?

 847 
01:04:30,716 --> 01:04:33,412
Yeah. lt was a turkey Slim Jim.

 848 
01:04:33,686 --> 01:04:35,086
You know, Dad....

 849 
01:04:36,823 --> 01:04:40,590
Maybe if you and Mom
listened to me a little more...

 850 
01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:43,025
...and took care of yourselves...

 851 
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:45,223
...maybe she'd still be here.

 852 
01:04:46,902 --> 01:04:51,306
lKnock off that hamburger talk.
Come here, honey.

 853 
01:04:54,611 --> 01:04:56,443
Your mom died...

 854 
01:04:57,348 --> 01:04:59,213
...because she got sick.

 855 
01:05:00,384 --> 01:05:02,910
And how do you think you get sick?

 856 
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:04,645
Germs.

 857 
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:06,959
lt's the way you eat.

 858 
01:05:45,171 --> 01:05:46,160
Who's that?

 859 
01:05:46,372 --> 01:05:50,207
You know my great-great-grandpappy
fought the measles?

 860 
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:55,611
There's been a Jones on the force
since we came on the umbilical cord.

 861 
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,943
Until now, that is.

 862 
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,183
All right, ladies.
Wrap it up now.

 863 
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:08,088
Well, l....
l guess l should get going.

 864 
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:11,325
Wouldn't want Frank
to build immunity to me.

 865 
01:06:11,536 --> 01:06:15,166
Maybe next time he takes Drixenol
it'll do him some good.

 866 
01:06:17,176 --> 01:06:19,770
-Goodbye, Drips.
-That's Drix.

 867 
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:21,539
Whatever.

 868 
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:19,713
People, let's get started.

 869 
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:24,818
l don't need to remind anyone
that today's our trip to Buffalo.

 870 
01:07:25,023 --> 01:07:30,326
Frank will be up in 20 minutes.
l don't want him losing an eyelash...

 871 
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:32,122
...or stubbing his toe.

 872 
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:38,396
Free screening?

 873 
01:07:38,605 --> 01:07:43,009
We're broadcasting live dreams
from the brain's subconscious.

 874 
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:55,691
You get back to work right now.

 875 
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:10,603
That's right, big boy.
You keep on dreaming.

 876 
01:08:11,312 --> 01:08:13,337
At least you got your health.

 877 
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:17,145
Ninety-eight point six.

 878 
01:08:17,352 --> 01:08:20,412
Ninety-eight point six.

 879 
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:24,660
-Ninety-eight point six.
-Perfect.

 880 
01:08:28,398 --> 01:08:30,423
You can't come in here!

 881 
01:08:38,544 --> 01:08:39,568
Baby...

 882 
01:08:39,778 --> 01:08:43,237
...you are looking fine today.

 883 
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:09,638
Don't forget the cushion
we take to football games.

 884 
01:09:09,848 --> 01:09:13,477
Don't want the voters
in the hemorrhoids complaining.

 885 
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:16,210
Something's wrong with the weather.

 886 
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:19,790
-We're probably drinking coffee.
-Look at the map.

 887 
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:22,518
-What if Jones is right?
-Jones?

 888 
01:09:23,797 --> 01:09:25,265
Funny. Funny.

 889 
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,400
You care more about your reelection...

 890 
01:09:28,603 --> 01:09:30,572
...than our lives.

 891 
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:33,970
l'm going to the hypothalamus
to check it out.

 892 
01:09:34,176 --> 01:09:35,667
Hypo-who-what is this?

 893 
01:09:35,879 --> 01:09:38,609
Leah, wait!
Who will answer the phones?

 894 
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:52,327
Be advised. We have a break-in.

 895 
01:09:58,539 --> 01:09:59,870
Sarge?

 896 
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:03,609
Nothing down there but bad dreams.

 897 
01:10:05,013 --> 01:10:06,708
Frankie.

 898 
01:10:10,786 --> 01:10:11,775
Wait.

 899 
01:10:13,056 --> 01:10:18,154
Maybe Shane would like to know
about the 200-yard restraining order.

 900 
01:10:19,464 --> 01:10:23,128
Maybe if you and Mom
listened to me a little more...

 901 
01:10:23,335 --> 01:10:25,803
...and took care of yourselves...

 902 
01:10:26,005 --> 01:10:30,204
-...maybe she'd still be here.
-You're fiired. Get out ofhere!

 903 
01:10:30,844 --> 01:10:33,939
-Get out!
-No, l can't.

 904 
01:10:35,483 --> 01:10:37,849
-Get back to work.
-What the-- Huh?

 905 
01:10:40,188 --> 01:10:42,315
What the heck was that?

 906 
01:10:43,592 --> 01:10:46,960
Francis Detorre,
you stand up right now!

 907 
01:10:49,633 --> 01:10:52,727
Thrax is alive and he's in the brain!

 908 
01:10:52,936 --> 01:10:55,599
Oh, great, pal. Spoil the ending.

 909 
01:10:55,807 --> 01:10:58,367
-What's your temperature?
-98.6.

 910 
01:10:58,576 --> 01:11:00,977
-ls this broken again?
-Drix!

 911 
01:11:02,014 --> 01:11:06,975
You get those skid marks
out ofmy class! Out the door!

 912 
01:11:31,549 --> 01:11:34,610
This cat was sick before l
even got here.

 913 
01:11:36,488 --> 01:11:40,448
Now boarding: the 937,
with nonstop service...

 914 
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:43,494
-...to the toilet bowl.
-Tickets, please.

 915 
01:11:48,536 --> 01:11:49,901
lKeep it moving.

 916 
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:51,572
-Thank you.
-Drix!

 917 
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:53,332
-Yo, Drix!
-Jones?

 918 
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,510
Get your butt off this boat!

 919 
01:11:55,711 --> 01:12:00,376
-Thrax is alive. Let's go.
-l'm sorry, Osmosis. l can't help you.

 920 
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:01,642
Excuse me?

 921 
01:12:01,852 --> 01:12:04,720
l can't combat a virus.
Read my label.

 922 
01:12:04,922 --> 01:12:07,390
Learn to think outside the pillbox.

 923 
01:12:07,592 --> 01:12:08,753
lKeep it moving.

 924 
01:12:09,161 --> 01:12:13,291
l know sugar pills who cured cancer,
because they believed.

 925 
01:12:13,766 --> 01:12:16,827
Oh, l don't know, Ozzy. Look at me.

 926 
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,332
l'm cherry-flavored.

 927 
01:12:21,509 --> 01:12:24,239
Hey, pal, are you on or off?

 928 
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:27,409
Fine. Flush your life
down the toilet.

 929 
01:12:27,616 --> 01:12:32,179
The zipper's down.
All ashore that's going ashore.

 930 
01:12:43,301 --> 01:12:47,170
-You know a pill who cured cancer?
-No.

 931 
01:12:47,373 --> 01:12:49,364
lt makes for a good pep talk.

 932 
01:12:50,776 --> 01:12:53,507
Let's go catch a cold.

 933 
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:59,851
How about a hug for your Uncle Bob?

 934 
01:13:00,054 --> 01:13:03,388
Okay. Nice talking to you too.

 935 
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:06,351
Hey, muscles.

 936 
01:13:06,963 --> 01:13:10,228
-You don't look so good.
-l feel a little fluey.

 937 
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:14,530
You know what they say,
''Starve a cold, drown the flu.''

 938 
01:13:14,738 --> 01:13:18,038
Your body needs fluids.
And lots of them.

 939 
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:19,841
ls beer fluid?

 940 
01:13:20,045 --> 01:13:21,239
Of course.

 941 
01:13:21,446 --> 01:13:25,941
-What about all that wet stuff in it?
-l thought that was the beer.

 942 
01:13:26,185 --> 01:13:30,316
No, finish that up.
Come on, we want to get better.

 943 
01:13:30,524 --> 01:13:35,428
There we go. That's it.
That's my good washboard-tummy guy.

 944 
01:13:37,298 --> 01:13:40,063
This is it. Men, go, go, go.

 945 
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:43,194
Hi, baby.

 946 
01:13:44,307 --> 01:13:46,332
Why are you waiting?
Shoot him!

 947 
01:13:46,543 --> 01:13:48,807
lf you follow me, she dies.

 948 
01:13:49,013 --> 01:13:50,002
Don't shoot.

 949 
01:13:57,322 --> 01:14:01,657
-This ain't time to get carsick.
-l'm okay, l'm 1/8 Dramamine!

 950 
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:04,227
lt's just this darn heat!

 951 
01:14:05,099 --> 01:14:08,967
As long as it don't hit 108 degrees,
or Shane's an orphan.

 952 
01:14:13,942 --> 01:14:18,403
Shane, look what l bought for you.
They're false eyelashes.

 953 
01:14:18,614 --> 01:14:19,979
Whatever.

 954 
01:14:24,788 --> 01:14:26,484
Just close your eye.

 955 
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:30,884
You look good with falsies.

 956 
01:14:36,135 --> 01:14:36,966
What the--?

 957 
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:38,569
Let me go!

 958 
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:51,514
Oh, don't worry.
Shane will be fiine.

 959 
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:55,922
l want to her to be at ease
and not worry.

 960 
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,183
Listen...

 961 
01:14:57,661 --> 01:15:00,824
...why don't you sit her down
and tell her...

 962 
01:15:01,031 --> 01:15:05,366
...that if anything happens to you,
l will take care of her. Okay?

 963 
01:15:05,904 --> 01:15:08,897
l will nurture her,
l will love her...

 964 
01:15:09,108 --> 01:15:12,043
...and when she's 1 6,
l'll boot her out.

 965 
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,706
Sixteen?

 966 
01:15:13,914 --> 01:15:18,613
l'm not gonna mommy her forever, okay?
l mean, sixteen, sure.

 967 
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:22,046
Frank? Are you all right?

 968 
01:15:25,961 --> 01:15:29,398
We've a hostage situation
involving the mayor's aide.

 969 
01:15:29,599 --> 01:15:32,124
Leah, girl, what were you thinking?

 970 
01:15:32,335 --> 01:15:33,563
Now, we go live...

 971 
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:37,298
...to a chase in the superior
vena cava expressway.

 972 
01:15:37,508 --> 01:15:40,205
Reports ofa hostage are confiirmed.

 973 
01:15:47,253 --> 01:15:48,379
Look out!

 974 
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:56,156
Suspect is headed towards the uvula.

 975 
01:15:56,398 --> 01:15:58,161
What the heck is a ''uvala''?

 976 
01:15:58,366 --> 01:16:02,531
-lt's that dangly thing in Frank's--
-Boxer shorts! Okay!

 977 
01:16:02,738 --> 01:16:04,035
Not that thing!

 978 
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,764
The one in his throat!

 979 
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:09,035
l knew that. l knew that.

 980 
01:16:13,251 --> 01:16:14,809
Are you with me?

 981 
01:16:15,053 --> 01:16:18,217
Frank, are you with me?
Are you okay?

 982 
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:20,891
l feel fine. Say it!

 983 
01:16:22,695 --> 01:16:24,526
Frank. Hold on, here.

 984 
01:16:24,764 --> 01:16:28,599
You're going to the hospital.
The trip is off.

 985 
01:16:28,803 --> 01:16:32,398
-Pull it over, big guy.
-The trip is off? No!

 986 
01:16:36,445 --> 01:16:38,471
Shane, isn't that your dad?

 987 
01:16:41,818 --> 01:16:43,377
Oh, my God.

 988 
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:45,886
Stop the bus!

 989 
01:16:46,457 --> 01:16:48,653
Dad! Uncle Bob!

 990 
01:16:51,996 --> 01:16:53,463
Shane, you're here?

 991 
01:16:53,665 --> 01:16:55,634
-l'm her niece!
-What happened?

 992 
01:16:55,835 --> 01:16:58,065
Your daddy's had an accident.

 993 
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,762
-ls he okay?
-He's going to be fine.

 994 
01:17:00,974 --> 01:17:04,034
l hope he's going to be okay.
Come on.

 995 
01:17:15,091 --> 01:17:17,685
Let me go! Watch the hands, buddy!

 996 
01:17:17,894 --> 01:17:19,657
-Hold up.
-Put me down!

 997 
01:17:19,863 --> 01:17:22,765
-Critical one here!
-Coming through.

 998 
01:17:25,904 --> 01:17:30,808
-What's the story on this one?
-l don't know. He's burning up.

 999 
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:34,446
Let's move on my mark.
One, two, lift!

 1000 
01:17:40,621 --> 01:17:45,650
-What is that nasty smell?
-Cherry. Wild cherry.

 1001 
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,123
Now let her go.

 1002 
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:51,557
Why? So you can ice me again?

 1003 
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,258
No! So l can!

 1004 
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,774
Virus con Dios.

 1005 
01:18:09,122 --> 01:18:11,022
Jones! Ooh, thank Frank.

 1006 
01:18:11,224 --> 01:18:12,350
Temperature?

 1007 
01:18:12,559 --> 01:18:14,892
-lt's at 106.2.
-Put him in ice!

 1008 
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:16,926
We gotta cool him down!

 1009 
01:18:19,034 --> 01:18:22,367
-We need some ice in here!
-Right, l'll get it.

 1010 
01:18:23,773 --> 01:18:24,762
Daddy?

 1011 
01:18:25,074 --> 01:18:26,268
Maggie.

 1012 
01:18:26,475 --> 01:18:28,739
No, Dad. lt's me, Shane.

 1013 
01:18:29,546 --> 01:18:32,174
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

 1014 
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,549
l ain't got time for this.

 1015 
01:18:40,926 --> 01:18:44,259
This is Frank PD.
We have you surrounded.

 1016 
01:18:44,463 --> 01:18:45,556
Surrender.

 1017 
01:18:45,765 --> 01:18:49,326
-Give it up. You're busted.
-Hand over the bracelet.

 1018 
01:18:49,536 --> 01:18:51,596
You're making this too easy.

 1019 
01:18:51,973 --> 01:18:53,998
-Pollen?
-Check this out.

 1020 
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:55,836
Oh, no!

 1021 
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,739
Mother of Frank!

 1022 
01:19:01,618 --> 01:19:04,086
Enjoy the funeral, boys!

 1023 
01:19:10,127 --> 01:19:12,619
-We're dead.
-How's your aim?

 1024 
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,458
A lot better than yours!

 1025 
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:16,532
What are you doing?

 1026 
01:19:17,937 --> 01:19:18,995
Saving Frank.

 1027 
01:19:19,405 --> 01:19:20,599
Let's do it.

 1028 
01:19:21,975 --> 01:19:23,499
You want Osmosis?

 1029 
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:25,371
You've got Osmosis.

 1030 
01:19:53,178 --> 01:19:57,309
You just don't know when to quit,
do you, Jones?

 1031 
01:20:14,571 --> 01:20:18,132
You know what, Jones?
You want this chain so bad...

 1032 
01:20:18,842 --> 01:20:22,836
...Big Daddy Thrax
is gonna let you have it.

 1033 
01:20:23,381 --> 01:20:25,247
Looks good on you, Jones.

 1034 
01:20:25,451 --> 01:20:26,941
You wear it well.

 1035 
01:20:27,386 --> 01:20:30,584
lt's a shame you came
this far just to die.

 1036 
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,839
Who's the Germinator now?

 1037 
01:20:56,988 --> 01:20:58,785
lt's a falsie.

 1038 
01:21:03,262 --> 01:21:06,663
Can you feel the heat, Jones?

 1039 
01:21:07,768 --> 01:21:11,465
Too bad you won't be here
to see me break my record...

 1040 
01:21:11,671 --> 01:21:15,810
...when l take down
Frank's pretty little girl.

 1041 
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:17,773
She ain't going down.

 1042 
01:21:20,382 --> 01:21:22,976
-You are.
-What?

 1043 
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:35,230
No!

 1044 
01:22:10,107 --> 01:22:12,235
We're losing him. Breathe!

 1045 
01:22:13,412 --> 01:22:17,509
-Come on, man.
-Daddy! No! l don't want to lose you!

 1046 
01:22:18,051 --> 01:22:20,042
-Take her out.
-Come on, honey.

 1047 
01:22:20,386 --> 01:22:24,517
-No, that's my dad!
-The doctor's doing everything he can.

 1048 
01:22:24,758 --> 01:22:25,747
Hey! Wait!

 1049 
01:22:26,661 --> 01:22:27,992
Frank!

 1050 
01:22:28,263 --> 01:22:29,491
Frank!

 1051 
01:22:36,072 --> 01:22:39,804
Things are grim as temperatures
rise dangerously.

 1052 
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:42,878
We've lost contact
with the extremities.

 1053 
01:22:43,081 --> 01:22:46,573
NNN will stay on the air
as long as possible.

 1054 
01:22:46,784 --> 01:22:51,813
When we return, household appliances
that can improve your golfswing.

 1055 
01:22:52,024 --> 01:22:56,394
You silly twit, don't you get it?!
We are going to die!

 1056 
01:22:56,596 --> 01:23:00,328
I knew it. At the fiirst dark cloud,
you fall apart.

 1057 
01:23:00,535 --> 01:23:01,593
-Moron!
-Phony!

 1058 
01:23:10,446 --> 01:23:15,714
Gentlemen, playing with you has been
the greatest pleasure of my life.

 1059 
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:39,872
He's not coming back.
He's not gonna make it.

 1060 
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,746
Come on, sweetheart.
He'll be....

 1061 
01:23:54,465 --> 01:23:55,454
That's it.

 1062 
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:57,157
-Wait, hey.
-Daddy!

 1063 
01:23:57,369 --> 01:24:00,031
l'm so sorry.
l didn't mean to say that.

 1064 
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:04,240
l don't blame you for Mom's death.
l didn't mean it.

 1065 
01:24:04,444 --> 01:24:06,970
You're the greatest dad in the world.

 1066 
01:24:38,017 --> 01:24:39,007
Look!

 1067 
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:57,234
Get that thing
to the hypothalamus now!

 1068 
01:25:02,913 --> 01:25:04,744
Okay, l'm calling it.

 1069 
01:25:04,948 --> 01:25:08,783
l'm sorry. sweetie.
Come on. l know.

 1070 
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:17,128
Wait a minute!
He's got a pulse!

 1071 
01:25:20,834 --> 01:25:22,666
He's coming back.

 1072 
01:25:23,004 --> 01:25:24,835
One-oh-seven-point-seven.

 1073 
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:27,406
One-oh-seven-point-six.

 1074 
01:25:36,653 --> 01:25:38,679
Your mama says, ''Hi.''

 1075 
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:59,980
As temperatures stabilize, a
grateful city salutes Osmosis Jones.

 1076 
01:26:00,181 --> 01:26:02,206
The offiicer who saved us.

 1077 
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:06,888
Jones has been reinstated
to the force with fullprivileges.

 1078 
01:26:07,089 --> 01:26:10,389
Ozzy, can l count on you
to keep Frank in shape?

 1079 
01:26:10,594 --> 01:26:13,085
We got that insurance
exam next month.

 1080 
01:26:13,296 --> 01:26:17,563
You're going to have to talk
to my new partner.

 1081 
01:26:17,835 --> 01:26:21,567
-lf he feels like hanging around.
-But my visa's expired.

 1082 
01:26:21,774 --> 01:26:25,643
We'll go to the hemorrhoid
and get you a good lawyer.

 1083 
01:26:28,848 --> 01:26:34,014
Come here, baby. l'm still Jonesing
for a little more Osmosis.

 1084 
01:27:16,271 --> 01:27:19,799
Oh, my God. Look how beautiful.

 1085 
01:27:20,376 --> 01:27:22,470
l told you it'd be worth it.

 1086 
01:27:25,082 --> 01:27:29,144
Didn't think l'd break a sweat
coming up here. But l did.

 1087 
01:27:30,388 --> 01:27:33,085
Yeah, it was kind of a long drive.

 1088 
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,459
Carrot?

 1089 
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:52,537
l wonder what this does.

 1090 
01:27:57,621 --> 01:27:59,749
-Dad.
-Was that you?

 1091 
01:28:01,959 --> 01:28:05,327
What the heck.
Out with the old, in with the new.
