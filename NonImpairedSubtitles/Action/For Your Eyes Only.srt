1
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,252
<i>Mr. Bond, Mr. Bond,
I'm so glad I caught you.</i>

2
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:16,839
<i>Your office called. They're sending
a helicopter to pick you up.</i>

3
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:18,674
<i>Some sort of emergency.</i>

4
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:20,843
<i>It usually is.
Thank you.</i>

5
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:46,470
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Bond.</i>

6
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:49,265
<i>Don't concern yourself
with the pilot.</i>

7
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:51,475
<i>One of my less useful people.</i>

8
00:02:57,064 --> 00:03:00,568
<i>You are now flying
Remote Control Airways.</i>

9
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:32,808
<i>Think twice, 007.
It's a long way down.</i>

10
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:12,807
<i>I've looked forward
to this moment, Mr. Bond.</i>

11
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,977
<i>I intend to enjoy it
to the full.</i>

12
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:55,850
<i>Really, have you no respect
for the dead?</i>

13
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:01,105
<i>Good-bye, Mr. Bond.</i>

14
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:04,233
<i>I trust you had a pleasant...
fright.</i>

15
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:26,088
<i>You are fading
from my picture, Mr. Bond.</i>

16
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:30,426
<i>But the end
cannot be far away.</i>

17
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,254
<i>Mr. Bond! Mr. Bond!</i>

18
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:11,676
<i>We can do a deal!</i>

19
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,639
<i>I'll buy you a delicatessen
in stainless steel.</i>

20
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:19,350
<i>Please!</i>

21
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,269
<i>All right, keep your hair on.</i>

22
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:24,480
<i>Put me down!
Put me down!</i>

23
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:26,983
<i>Oh, you want to get off?</i>

24
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,529
<i>Mr. Bond!</i>

25
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,598
<i>For your eyes only</i>

26
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,935
<i>Can see me through the night</i>

27
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:07,356
<i>For your eyes only</i>

28
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,860
<i>I never need to hide</i>

29
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:15,907
<i>You can see so much in me</i>

30
00:07:15,948 --> 00:07:19,118
<i>So much in me that's new</i>

31
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:27,293
<i>I never felt till I looked at you</i>

32
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:32,798
<i>For your eyes only</i>

33
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,635
<i>Only for you</i>

34
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:37,470
<i>You'll see what no one else can see</i>

35
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,473
<i>Now I'm breakin' free</i>

36
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:43,476
<i>For your eyes only</i>

37
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,021
<i>Only for you</i>

38
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:50,149
<i>The love I know you need in me</i>

39
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:53,110
<i>The fantasy you freed in me</i>

40
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:57,114
<i>Only for you</i>

41
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,755
<i>For your eyes only</i>

42
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:15,883
<i>The nights are never cold</i>

43
00:08:18,177 --> 00:08:20,972
<i>You really know me</i>

44
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:24,517
<i>That's all I need to know</i>

45
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:29,564
<i>Maybe I'm an open book</i>

46
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:33,067
<i>Because I know you're mine</i>

47
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:41,200
<i>But you won't need
to read between the lines</i>

48
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:46,831
<i>For your eyes only</i>

49
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,500
<i>Only for you</i>

50
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,419
<i>You'll see what no one else can see
'cause now I'm breakin' free</i>

51
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:58,175
<i>For your eyes only</i>

52
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:00,845
<i>Only for you</i>

53
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:04,098
<i>The passions that collide in me</i>

54
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:06,893
<i>The wild, abandoned side of me</i>

55
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:10,980
<i>Only for you</i>

56
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:16,944
<i>For your eyes only</i>

57
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:24,011
<i>Afternoon.
How's it looking topside?</i>

58
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:27,014
<i>Beautiful day.
Just bringing the nets in.</i>

59
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:29,016
<i>Fish for supper again.</i>

60
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:43,406
<i>Decode of Russian satellite data, sir,
on British and American ship positions.</i>

61
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,950
<i>- Verify and advise Admiralty.
- Yes, sir.</i>

62
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,788
<i>- Afternoon, sir.
- Oh, hello, Mac.</i>

63
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,333
<i>My watch.</i>

64
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:41,005
<i>Where the hell
did that come from?</i>

65
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:49,138
<i>- What the devil's going on here?
- An unidentified object closing fast.</i>

66
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:09,033
<i>Destruct ATAC system.</i>

67
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:51,701
<i>- Yes?
- First Sea Lord and Vice Admiral, sir.</i>

68
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,327
<i>Send them in.</i>

69
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,042
<i>Shocking news, Minister.</i>

70
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:03,671
<i>I'm afraid we've lost our electronic
surveillance ship, the St. Georges.</i>

71
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:06,007
<i>We had a routine message
at 1600 hours yesterday...</i>

72
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:08,634
<i>then nothing.</i>

73
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:10,511
<i>We sighted floating debris
this morning.</i>

74
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:14,182
<i>My God, Jack.
How deep is the water there?</i>

75
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:17,226
<i>Not deep enough, I'm afraid.</i>

76
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:23,065
<i>Yes, Comrade Secretary.
Off Albania.</i>

77
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,695
<i>The suspected British spy ship
which we have been monitoring.</i>

78
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:31,115
<i>It suggests that there is a chance
of obtaining...</i>

79
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:33,117
<i>the ATAC transmitter.</i>

80
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:38,581
<i>Oh, of course, comrade.
There will be no direct involvement...</i>

81
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:42,084
<i>but if it comes on the market,
we should not lose...</i>

82
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:44,587
<i>such a remarkable opportunity.</i>

83
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:51,260
<i>With that in mind, I've already
contacted our usual friend in Greece.</i>

84
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:43,312
<i>Down you go. Go on.</i>

85
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,815
<i>Down you go.</i>

86
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:53,823
<i>Give us a kiss.
Give us a kiss.</i>

87
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:56,617
<i>I'll give you a nut.
Here you are. Go on.</i>

88
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,957
<i>Come on.</i>

89
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,169
<i>- Your packages, senorita.
- Oh, thank you.</i>

90
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,551
<i>Melina!</i>

91
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,820
<i>- Thank you, darling.
- Hello, Daddy.</i>

92
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,199
<i>Welcome home, Melina, my darling.</i>

93
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,242
<i>- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.</i>

94
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:41,245
<i>Your call from Athens
was such a pleasant surprise.</i>

95
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:44,248
<i>I was lucky to find you.
You left Crete so suddenly.</i>

96
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:47,919
<i>Ah, yes, I wanted to come back here
and start work on the temple again.</i>

97
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:51,255
<i>- You between jobs?
- Only for a few days.</i>

98
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:55,468
<i>- I'll lend a hand if you want.
- Darling, it's beautiful. Thank you.</i>

99
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:58,554
<i>That's for you,
and pistachios for Max.</i>

100
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,802
<i>James.</i>

101
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:23,097
<i>Moneypenny,
a feast for my eyes.</i>

102
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:25,099
<i>What about the rest of you?</i>

103
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:27,643
<i>Well, I was going to get
around to that.</i>

104
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:30,479
<i>You'd better go in.
M's on leave...</i>

105
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,648
<i>and the minister's arrived here
with the chief of staff...</i>

106
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,859
<i>and wants to see you immediately.</i>

107
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:37,486
<i>- I'll be right back.
- I can hardly wait.</i>

108
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,907
<i>Oh, haven't you forgotten something?</i>

109
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,242
<i>Oh. Well, as M's away...</i>

110
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:52,084
<i>Ah, there you are, 007.</i>

111
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:54,253
<i>Minister, Chief of Staff.</i>

112
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,923
<i>Are you aware
of our ATAC system, 007?</i>

113
00:17:57,006 --> 00:18:00,593
<i>ATAC, sir? Automatic Targeting
Attack Communicator.</i>

114
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:03,095
<i>Uses an ultra-low frequency coded
transmitter...</i>

115
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,057
<i>to order our submarines
to launch ballistic missiles.</i>

116
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,560
<i>Five days ago, our spy ship,
St. Georges was sunk...</i>

117
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,062
<i>in the lonian Sea.</i>

118
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:13,356
<i>She was equipped with ATAC.</i>

119
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:15,608
<i>Now, if that transmitter
were to fall into the wrong hands...</i>

120
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:18,569
<i>it would render our entire
Polaris fleet useless.</i>

121
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,573
<i>- Every order could be countermanded.
- Worse.</i>

122
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:26,369
<i>Our own submarines could be ordered
to attack our own cities.</i>

123
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:29,872
<i>Have we begun
a salvage operation, Minister?</i>

124
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:32,917
<i>An official operation
was out of the question.</i>

125
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,419
<i>The St. Georges was off
the Albanian coast.</i>

126
00:18:35,503 --> 00:18:36,921
<i>We asked Sir Timothy Havelock...</i>

127
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:39,549
<i>the marine archaeologist,
to secretly locate the wreck.</i>

128
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:42,426
<i>Before he could send in his report,
he and his wife were killed...</i>

129
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:45,555
<i>by a Cuban hit man,
Hector Gonzales.</i>

130
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:48,641
<i>The Greek police were able
to identify Gonzales...</i>

131
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,936
<i>from a description given to them
by Melina, Sir Havelock's daughter.</i>

132
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:56,566
<i>Operation Undertow.
The information's all here.</i>

133
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,235
<i>Now, Gonzales is at a villa
near Madrid.</i>

134
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,612
<i>Isolate him and apply
the necessary pressure...</i>

135
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:04,699
<i>to find out who hired him.</i>

136
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:37,018
<i>A Walther PPK...</i>

137
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:40,521
<i>standard issue,
British Secret Service.</i>

138
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:42,023
<i>License to kill.</i>

139
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:45,610
<i>Or be killed.</i>

140
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,862
<i>Take him away.</i>

141
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:06,107
<i>Whoever you are, you've outstayed
your welcome. Come on.</i>

142
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:40,183
<i>- Well, I hope you have a car.
- This way.</i>

143
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,369
<i>Hurry.</i>

144
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:15,218
<i>- Who are you?
- He killed my parents.</i>

145
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:18,846
<i>The Havelocks?
I'm sorry.</i>

146
00:24:25,686 --> 00:24:27,355
<i>How did you know
where Gonzales was?</i>

147
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:30,775
<i>Through a detective agency.
What were you doing there?</i>

148
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:35,238
<i>I'm afraid we're being
out-horsepowered.</i>

149
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:52,129
<i>Excuse me.</i>

150
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:06,602
<i>Take the low road.</i>

151
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:11,065
<i>Not that low.</i>

152
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,831
<i>You don't mind
if I drive, do you?</i>

153
00:26:43,574 --> 00:26:46,744
<i>Go backwards. Forwards.
Quickly.</i>

154
00:27:48,472 --> 00:27:51,475
<i>I love a drive in the country,
don't you?</i>

155
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,817
<i>Hold tight.</i>

156
00:28:25,384 --> 00:28:28,346
<i>Oh, by the way, we haven't been
properly introduced, Melina.</i>

157
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:31,933
<i>My name is Bond, James Bond.</i>

158
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:40,525
<i>Olympic has a flight at 11:00.</i>

159
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:46,322
<i>It should be safe to go
to the airport now.</i>

160
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:55,748
<i>- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, really.</i>

161
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,293
<i>Are you going back
to your father's ship?</i>

162
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:03,631
<i>Yes, I'm continuing his work,
but this business is still unfinished.</i>

163
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:06,676
<i>- What business?
- The man who paid Gonzales.</i>

164
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:10,513
<i>The Chinese have a saying:</i>

165
00:29:10,555 --> 00:29:15,518
<i>"Before setting out on revenge,
you first dig two graves. "</i>

166
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:18,020
<i>I don't expect you to understand.</i>

167
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:21,858
<i>You're English,
but I'm half Greek.</i>

168
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,610
<i>And Greek women, like Electra...</i>

169
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:27,572
<i>always avenge their loved ones.</i>

170
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:30,575
<i>I must go.</i>

171
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:41,711
<i>You were meant to question Gonzales,
not let Miss Havelock perforate him.</i>

172
00:29:41,752 --> 00:29:43,212
<i>I quite agree, sir.</i>

173
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:47,383
<i>We'll have to tell the prime minister
Operation Undertow is dead in the water.</i>

174
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:49,552
<i>She'll have our guts
for garters.</i>

175
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:52,096
<i>If you care to look again...</i>

176
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,265
<i>at page two, paragraph four
of my report, sir...</i>

177
00:29:54,348 --> 00:29:57,351
<i>you will note that I saw someone
paying off Gonzales.</i>

178
00:29:57,435 --> 00:30:00,646
<i>Now, assuming that that was
for Havelock's murder...</i>

179
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,356
<i>then there's still
a glimmer of hope.</i>

180
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,900
<i>I don't follow.</i>

181
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:06,444
<i>If we could identify that someone...</i>

182
00:30:06,485 --> 00:30:08,446
<i>Why don't you try
the identigraph?</i>

183
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:13,576
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Get cracking, 007.</i>

184
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:16,329
<i>Minister.</i>

185
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,920
<i>Hello, Q.
Smithers, how's the arm?</i>

186
00:30:24,003 --> 00:30:25,963
<i>Coming along very nicely,
thank you, sir.</i>

187
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:30,259
<i>Oh, that'll come in handy.</i>

188
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:32,261
<i>What are you doing here, 007?</i>

189
00:30:32,303 --> 00:30:34,639
<i>- Identigraph, Q.
- This way.</i>

190
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:49,278
<i>- Stinging in the rain?
- That's not funny, 007.</i>

191
00:30:50,571 --> 00:30:53,115
<i>I see you managed to get the Lotus
back together again.</i>

192
00:30:53,157 --> 00:30:57,286
<i>I disregard these jibes
about our equipment, 007.</i>

193
00:30:57,328 --> 00:30:59,539
<i>I don't suppose you find it funny
in the field.</i>

194
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:01,040
<i>Indeed, I don't.</i>

195
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:11,634
<i>This 3-D Visual Identigraph
is still in the experimental stage.</i>

196
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:14,929
<i>Now, once we get
a composite of the man...</i>

197
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:18,307
<i>we can find a match by patching
into the photographic files...</i>

198
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:22,311
<i>of the Surety, Interpol,
CIA, the Mossad.</i>

199
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:27,275
<i>And the West German police.
You've told me so already five times.</i>

200
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:31,445
<i>Thank you, 007.
Right.</i>

201
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:36,200
<i>Now describe the person
you wish to identify...</i>

202
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:38,244
<i>and I'll program the information.</i>

203
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:42,206
<i>Male Caucasian,
late thirties.</i>

204
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:46,878
<i>Hair: Fine, light brown.</i>

205
00:31:49,422 --> 00:31:51,048
<i>That's it.</i>

206
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:53,885
<i>- Parted in the middle.
- Wait a minute.</i>

207
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:56,470
<i>- Right.
- Eyes.</i>

208
00:31:56,554 --> 00:31:58,681
<i>- A little smaller.
- Uh-huh.</i>

209
00:31:58,764 --> 00:32:02,476
<i>Blue. A little grayer.</i>

210
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,646
<i>That's it. You have it.
Now, nose.</i>

211
00:32:08,608 --> 00:32:11,194
<i>- A nose, not a banana, Q.
- I'm sorry.</i>

212
00:32:11,235 --> 00:32:12,904
<i>Stop.</i>

213
00:32:12,987 --> 00:32:14,864
<i>Lips fuller.</i>

214
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:16,407
<i>Mm-hmm. Oops.</i>

215
00:32:18,451 --> 00:32:21,829
<i>No, no, mouth wider.
Good.</i>

216
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,501
<i>Thank you.</i>

217
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:30,004
<i>Thank you, Sharon.</i>

218
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:33,007
<i>- You can go. I'll lock up.
- Okay.</i>

219
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:38,763
<i>I reckon we're almost there, Q,
apart from glasses.</i>

220
00:32:38,804 --> 00:32:40,181
<i>Steel-rimmed.</i>

221
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:42,558
<i>- Yeah.
- Octagonal.</i>

222
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,227
<i>Octagonal.</i>

223
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:49,565
<i>That's him.
That's our man.</i>

224
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:53,110
<i>Right. I'll try
and get a match.</i>

225
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,210
<i>Yes.</i>

226
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:12,129
<i>The man we want is
Emile Leopold Locque...</i>

227
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:14,757
<i>an enforcer
in the Brussels underworld.</i>

228
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:16,300
<i>He's been convicted
of several...</i>

229
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,427
<i>particularly brutal murders.</i>

230
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:20,721
<i>He escaped from Namur Prison...</i>

231
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:22,932
<i>by strangling his psychiatrist.</i>

232
00:33:23,015 --> 00:33:26,727
<i>He has worked for drug syndicates
in Marseilles and Hong Kong.</i>

233
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:29,438
<i>Now reported working
for Greek smugglers.</i>

234
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,942
<i>The Italian Secret Service think
that he is, at this moment, in Cortina.</i>

235
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:36,988
<i>I'll instruct Ferrara, our man
in northern Italy, to contact you there.</i>

236
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:41,284
<i>- Yes, sir.
- And 007, try not to muck it up again.</i>

237
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,911
<i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>

238
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:46,873
<i>I'll leave you to lock up.
Let me out, will you?</i>

239
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:27,890
<i>The snow this year
is better at Innsbruck.</i>

240
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:30,518
<i>But not at St. Moritz.</i>

241
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:34,522
<i>- Ferrara.
- Bond. James.</i>

242
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:36,524
<i>Luigi.</i>

243
00:35:36,607 --> 00:35:39,235
<i>I presume London has briefed you.</i>

244
00:35:39,277 --> 00:35:42,572
<i>If Locque's in Cortina,
we'll find him.</i>

245
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:46,534
<i>I have a reliable Greek contact here,
an Anglophile.</i>

246
00:35:46,617 --> 00:35:49,662
<i>He helped us out last year
on a smuggling operation.</i>

247
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:52,832
<i>- What's he doing in Cortina?
- He...</i>

248
00:35:56,794 --> 00:36:00,381
<i>Spends a few months a year here
at his chalet.</i>

249
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:04,719
<i>He's in shipping, insurance,
oil exploration.</i>

250
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:06,762
<i>Knows everything going on.</i>

251
00:36:06,804 --> 00:36:08,848
<i>Very reliable.</i>

252
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:12,560
<i>The British gave him the King's Medal
for resistance fighting during the war.</i>

253
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,437
<i>Yes, but can I meet him?</i>

254
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,608
<i>I've set it up. He is waiting for us
at the Olympic ice rink.</i>

255
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:43,007
<i>- Kristatos. Ari Kristatos.
- Bond. James Bond.</i>

256
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,092
<i>Would you care to join me
in some gluhwein?</i>

257
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:47,261
<i>That's a very good idea.
Thank you.</i>

258
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:52,266
<i>Well, gentlemen,
how can I help you?</i>

259
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,977
<i>We'd like some information.</i>

260
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,529
<i>My protege.
A sure winner...</i>

261
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,030
<i>in the next Olympics.</i>

262
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:08,533
<i>She's completely absorbed
in her skating...</i>

263
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:10,826
<i>but innocent in the ways
of the world.</i>

264
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,287
<i>The day she wins the gold medal...</i>

265
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:16,290
<i>will be the greatest in my life.</i>

266
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,176
<i>Bibi, here are some
new admirers for you.</i>

267
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,346
<i>Mr. Bond, Mr. Ferrara,
Bibi Dahl...</i>

268
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:34,183
<i>and her coach, Jacoba Brink,
once a world-class skater herself.</i>

269
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:35,852
<i>I've seen Miss Brink skate.</i>

270
00:37:35,935 --> 00:37:38,896
<i>I think the world will soon be seeing
a great deal of your skating too.</i>

271
00:37:38,938 --> 00:37:40,898
<i>Only if she works harder.</i>

272
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:42,733
<i>- Much harder.
- Oh, Uncle Ari.</i>

273
00:37:42,817 --> 00:37:44,735
<i>Can I stop now?
I'm pooped.</i>

274
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:47,530
<i>That's for Miss Brink to decide.</i>

275
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:50,408
<i>Come, Bibi,
another half hour of practice.</i>

276
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:52,702
<i>Uncle Ari, will you take me
to the biathlon?</i>

277
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:55,246
<i>Bibi, you know I have to work
this afternoon.</i>

278
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,878
<i>Bibi wants to know
if you would escort her, Mr. Bond.</i>

279
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,880
<i>- I don't think...
- I would feel better...</i>

280
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:05,882
<i>if there were someone with her.</i>

281
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:11,762
<i>I'd be delighted.
I'm staying at the Miramonti.</i>

282
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:13,389
<i>Great!</i>

283
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:17,518
<i>How can I help?</i>

284
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:19,729
<i>- Do you know this man?
- Yes. Locque.</i>

285
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,565
<i>Columbo's right hand.</i>

286
00:38:22,607 --> 00:38:25,026
<i>Milos Columbo.
His name came up in connection...</i>

287
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:27,278
<i>with a smuggling operation
last year.</i>

288
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:32,450
<i>That's the least of his offenses.
Drugs, white slavery, contract murder.</i>

289
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:36,078
<i>In the Greek underworld,
he in known as "the Dove. "</i>

290
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:37,747
<i>A very sick joke.</i>

291
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,125
<i>- Where is this Dove?
- Somewhere in Greece, I would guess.</i>

292
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,961
<i>Once we were like brothers.
Now he hates me.</i>

293
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:46,422
<i>We fought together
in the Greek resistance...</i>

294
00:38:46,464 --> 00:38:48,966
<i>then against the Communists.</i>

295
00:38:49,008 --> 00:38:51,135
<i>After that,
he took a different path.</i>

296
00:38:55,473 --> 00:38:57,725
<i>Thank you for your time,
Mr. Kristatos.</i>

297
00:38:57,808 --> 00:38:59,560
<i>My pleasure.
I leave for Corfu soon.</i>

298
00:38:59,644 --> 00:39:02,438
<i>If I get any more information,
I will call Ferrara.</i>

299
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:17,203
<i>What do you think, Luigi?
Does this "Dove" Columbo...</i>

300
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:19,205
<i>have the resources
to mount a salvage operation?</i>

301
00:39:19,288 --> 00:39:23,960
<i>Oh, definitely. He runs a fleet of
intercoastal freighters in the Aegean.</i>

302
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:27,171
<i>I'll ring my office in Milano.
They may have more on him.</i>

303
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,017
<i>- I'll see you later.
- Okay.</i>

304
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:57,660
<i>Is this the one you mean?</i>

305
00:39:57,702 --> 00:40:01,664
<i>Thank you. I'll take it.
Deliver it to the Hotel Cristalo.</i>

306
00:40:11,215 --> 00:40:13,176
<i>I beg your pardon.</i>

307
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:18,389
<i>- May I help you?
- Yes, give me a dozen lilies.</i>

308
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:19,682
<i>Will you?</i>

309
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:28,232
<i>I'll pick them up later.</i>

310
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:37,992
<i>Come on, quickly.</i>

311
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:56,469
<i>Send them to the funeral,
will you?</i>

312
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:04,894
<i>Slow down. Would you mind telling me
what the devil you're doing in Cortina?</i>

313
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:08,481
<i>- Your telegram.
- What telegram?</i>

314
00:41:08,564 --> 00:41:11,984
<i>It said you found the man
and to meet you here today.</i>

315
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:13,444
<i>I didn't send it.</i>

316
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:14,946
<i>Now, get in.</i>

317
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:18,950
<i>The station, please.</i>

318
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:23,246
<i>- Are we leaving?
- Not "we. " You. And now.</i>

319
00:41:23,287 --> 00:41:25,790
<i>You don't tell me
what to do.</i>

320
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:44,517
<i>Did you find the man
who hired Gonzales?</i>

321
00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:47,270
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

322
00:41:47,311 --> 00:41:49,272
<i>He's here, isn't he?</i>

323
00:41:50,898 --> 00:41:53,734
<i>That's why you're here.
Driver, stop! Go back!</i>

324
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,865
<i>- I'm staying.
- So you can put an arrow in his back?</i>

325
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:02,076
<i>You do that, and we'll never find out
who or what is behind all this.</i>

326
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,830
<i>It was my parents they killed,
not yours. Let me out. Driver, stop!</i>

327
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:11,752
<i>Melina, look at me.</i>

328
00:42:11,836 --> 00:42:14,463
<i>You were lucky once,
but they are onto you now.</i>

329
00:42:14,547 --> 00:42:17,967
<i>The telegram, the motorcycles
back there. They prove it.</i>

330
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:21,345
<i>- Let me handle this.
- You? How are you involved?</i>

331
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:25,433
<i>All I can tell you is it's something
of vital interest to both our countries.</i>

332
00:42:25,516 --> 00:42:28,436
<i>More important than my parents?</i>

333
00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:32,398
<i>Your father was part of it.</i>

334
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,400
<i>He thought it important enough
to risk his life.</i>

335
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:37,028
<i>Now, Melina, please trust me.</i>

336
00:42:37,111 --> 00:42:39,197
<i>Go back to the Triaina and wait.</i>

337
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,033
<i>Let me find out what I can here,
then I'll come straight to Corfu.</i>

338
00:42:42,116 --> 00:42:44,035
<i>- I promise you.
- Okay.</i>

339
00:42:44,118 --> 00:42:47,955
<i>I'll go back and wait,
but not for long.</i>

340
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,540
<i>It won't be, I swear.</i>

341
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:41,926
<i>Don't they have showers
at the ice rink?</i>

342
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:43,928
<i>How did you get in here?</i>

343
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:45,763
<i>One of the porters is a fan.</i>

344
00:43:45,847 --> 00:43:51,185
<i>He'll do anything for me,
and I'll do anything for you.</i>

345
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:54,272
<i>Well, I'm exceedingly
flattered, Bibi...</i>

346
00:43:54,355 --> 00:43:56,107
<i>but you're in training.</i>

347
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,111
<i>That's a laugh. Everybody knows
it builds up muscle tone.</i>

348
00:44:00,194 --> 00:44:05,241
<i>How about building up a little more
muscle tone by putting on your clothes?</i>

349
00:44:07,535 --> 00:44:08,953
<i>Don't you like me?</i>

350
00:44:11,038 --> 00:44:13,499
<i>I think you're wonderful, Bibi...</i>

351
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:17,003
<i>but I don't think your Uncle Ari
would approve.</i>

352
00:44:17,086 --> 00:44:20,173
<i>Him? He thinks
I'm still a virgin.</i>

353
00:44:21,716 --> 00:44:27,263
<i>Yes, well, you get your clothes on,
and I'll buy you an ice cream.</i>

354
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:36,814
<i>Shall we?</i>

355
00:44:42,904 --> 00:44:45,114
<i>Don't you ever come up for air?</i>

356
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:48,784
<i>That's why I'll get the gold medal...
breath control.</i>

357
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:51,787
<i>Yes, well, you can't lose.</i>

358
00:45:21,317 --> 00:45:23,277
<i>And now, Erich Kriegler...</i>

359
00:45:23,361 --> 00:45:26,239
<i>last year's East European champion.</i>

360
00:45:33,913 --> 00:45:35,498
<i>There's Erich Kriegler.</i>

361
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,458
<i>The East German champion?</i>

362
00:45:39,043 --> 00:45:40,753
<i>Isn't he beautiful?</i>

363
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:42,880
<i>You know something, Bibi?
You're fickle.</i>

364
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:46,259
<i>Hey, Erich!</i>

365
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,762
<i>Come on, let's go watch him shoot.</i>

366
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:22,461
<i>We'll have a drink
at the finish.</i>

367
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:26,674
<i>Well, Bibi, I'm afraid
I have to leave you.</i>

368
00:46:26,757 --> 00:46:30,136
<i>- No, James, stay with me.
- I have an appointment.</i>

369
00:46:32,138 --> 00:46:35,308
<i>Will you come and say good-bye to me
at the practice rink later?</i>

370
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:37,602
<i>Please, James, we're going back
to Greece soon.</i>

371
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:39,604
<i>All right, but if I can't make it...</i>

372
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:41,939
<i>all I can say is
don't grow up any more.</i>

373
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:45,401
<i>- Huh?
- The opposite sex won't survive it.</i>

374
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,201
<i>Won't take long.</i>

375
00:55:55,284 --> 00:55:58,371
<i>- Don't play with any of the switches.
- Right.</i>

376
00:56:13,845 --> 00:56:15,805
<i>What took you so long?</i>

377
00:56:15,888 --> 00:56:17,640
<i>I took the scenic route.</i>

378
00:56:19,016 --> 00:56:22,144
<i>Tell me more about your boyfriend,
Erich Kriegler.</i>

379
00:56:22,228 --> 00:56:26,440
<i>He doesn't smoke, he only eats health
foods and he won't even talk to girls.</i>

380
00:56:28,192 --> 00:56:29,777
<i>James, you're jealous.</i>

381
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:34,991
<i>Of course. What else can you tell me
about my rival for your affections?</i>

382
00:56:35,074 --> 00:56:38,494
<i>They say he's a defector
from East Germany.</i>

383
00:56:38,536 --> 00:56:41,247
<i>It is time
for your rubdown.</i>

384
00:56:50,047 --> 00:56:53,176
<i>I could eat you up alive.</i>

385
00:56:55,887 --> 00:56:59,807
<i>Farewell, Mr. Bond,
but not good-bye.</i>

386
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:44,954
<i>I'll be finished around 6:00.
Meet me here.</i>

387
00:58:47,206 --> 00:58:49,167
<i>How did you know I was here?</i>

388
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:52,503
<i>I radio telephoned the Triaina,
and they told me you were coming ashore.</i>

389
00:58:52,587 --> 00:58:55,464
<i>I have to go shopping for the crew.
Come with me, we can talk.</i>

390
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:56,632
<i>Why not?</i>

391
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:21,657
<i>Thank you.</i>

392
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,458
<i>I think you may need that.</i>

393
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,861
<i>My father loved the view
from here.</i>

394
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:03,241
<i>- I can see why.
- We came here often.</i>

395
01:00:03,324 --> 01:00:05,576
<i>- Is Corfu your home?
- No.</i>

396
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:09,163
<i>My real home's always been
the Triaina, the Greek islands...</i>

397
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:13,292
<i>Turkey, North Africa...
wherever my father's work took us.</i>

398
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:18,381
<i>Did he leave any notes?
They could help us.</i>

399
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:20,883
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

400
01:00:22,468 --> 01:00:24,720
<i>To tell you the truth...</i>

401
01:00:24,804 --> 01:00:28,140
<i>I haven't had the courage
to go into his study since.</i>

402
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:31,811
<i>Try not to think about it now.</i>

403
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,730
<i>I'm meeting a man tonight
at the casino who may give us a lead.</i>

404
01:01:06,888 --> 01:01:09,265
<i>You're perspiring, Bunky.</i>

405
01:01:10,558 --> 01:01:11,976
<i>Contessa.</i>

406
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:25,489
<i>500,000.</i>

407
01:01:25,573 --> 01:01:28,826
<i>Only half?
Where's your courage, Bunky?</i>

408
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:32,788
<i>Courage is no match
for an unfriendly shoe, Countess.</i>

409
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,293
<i>Bravo, Bunky.</i>

410
01:01:44,008 --> 01:01:45,593
<i>Lucky night.</i>

411
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:06,614
<i>The odds favor standing pat.</i>

412
01:02:06,697 --> 01:02:08,491
<i>If you play the odds.</i>

413
01:02:16,374 --> 01:02:20,378
<i>Would you cash these in
for me, please?</i>

414
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:22,880
<i>Thank you. Excuse me.</i>

415
01:02:41,983 --> 01:02:43,484
<i>Aperitif, please?</i>

416
01:02:43,568 --> 01:02:45,486
<i>Ouzo for me, please.</i>

417
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,824
<i>And a whiskey.</i>

418
01:02:51,242 --> 01:02:52,660
<i>And to eat?</i>

419
01:02:52,743 --> 01:02:57,665
<i>I'll have the prawns,
salad and Bourdetto.</i>

420
01:02:57,748 --> 01:02:59,876
<i>An excellent choice.
I'll have the same.</i>

421
01:02:59,917 --> 01:03:03,671
<i>May I suggest a white wine
from my home place?</i>

422
01:03:03,754 --> 01:03:07,675
<i>If you'll forgive me, that's
a little too scented for my palate.</i>

423
01:03:07,758 --> 01:03:10,803
<i>I prefer the Theotaki Aspro.</i>

424
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:16,142
<i>After our last meeting,
I am asking myself...</i>

425
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:19,270
<i>why you want to know about Locque,
Columbo's man.</i>

426
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:23,900
<i>I know Columbo runs heroin
to be refined here...</i>

427
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:25,860
<i>before it's sent to England.</i>

428
01:03:25,943 --> 01:03:28,112
<i>So I think I see the answer.</i>

429
01:03:28,196 --> 01:03:31,115
<i>You're from the British Narcotics Board.</i>

430
01:03:31,991 --> 01:03:33,409
<i>Am I right?</i>

431
01:03:33,451 --> 01:03:35,161
<i>Go on.</i>

432
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,291
<i>I wish you luck, my friend.</i>

433
01:03:40,374 --> 01:03:43,377
<i>But I must warn you,
stopping Columbo will be difficult.</i>

434
01:03:43,461 --> 01:03:47,673
<i>He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.</i>

435
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,300
<i>Find some different way.</i>

436
01:03:49,383 --> 01:03:52,678
<i>You may have to kill him.</i>

437
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,598
<i>Does this discourage you?</i>

438
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:00,478
<i>- Just tell me where he is.
- Over there.</i>

439
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:02,063
<i>With the woman in blue.</i>

440
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:09,111
<i>We ignore each other,
but I wanted you to see him.</i>

441
01:04:09,195 --> 01:04:10,988
<i>He is a secret partner
in this casino.</i>

442
01:04:11,072 --> 01:04:13,324
<i>But we are perfectly safe.</i>

443
01:04:13,407 --> 01:04:16,410
<i>He will do nothing in his own place.</i>

444
01:04:16,494 --> 01:04:18,788
<i>And the countess?</i>

445
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:21,833
<i>Lisl, an Austrian.</i>

446
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:25,461
<i>Expensive mistress.
She sometimes shills for the house.</i>

447
01:04:25,545 --> 01:04:28,172
<i>She bets with other people's money.</i>

448
01:04:50,403 --> 01:04:53,322
<i>But I must warn you,
stopping Columbo will be difficult.</i>

449
01:04:53,364 --> 01:04:56,993
<i>He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.</i>

450
01:04:57,034 --> 01:04:59,537
<i>You must find a different way.</i>

451
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,540
<i>You may have to kill him.</i>

452
01:05:02,623 --> 01:05:07,211
<i>Does this discourage you?</i>

453
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:09,213
<i>Just tell me where he is.</i>

454
01:05:23,477 --> 01:05:26,856
<i>You are a disgusting man.
How dare you talk to me like that?</i>

455
01:05:26,898 --> 01:05:31,110
<i>I will speak to you any way I please.
Sit down.</i>

456
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:33,571
<i>You're making a spectacle
of yourself.</i>

457
01:05:34,906 --> 01:05:35,865
<i>Get out!</i>

458
01:05:35,907 --> 01:05:39,243
<i>Nothing would please me more.</i>

459
01:05:47,585 --> 01:05:50,713
<i>- This may be an opportunity.
- This may be a trap.</i>

460
01:05:50,755 --> 01:05:52,965
<i>If you play the odds.</i>

461
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:56,511
<i>As you wish. Take my car.
I'll play a little chemin.</i>

462
01:05:56,594 --> 01:05:59,180
<i>Ask the chauffeur
to come back for me.</i>

463
01:06:09,524 --> 01:06:11,442
<i>Allow me.</i>

464
01:06:11,526 --> 01:06:13,402
<i>May I drive you home?</i>

465
01:06:13,486 --> 01:06:16,030
<i>No, thank you.
I'll take a taxi.</i>

466
01:06:16,113 --> 01:06:18,032
<i>No courage?</i>

467
01:06:18,115 --> 01:06:21,077
<i>Seriously, you may have a job
finding one.</i>

468
01:06:22,328 --> 01:06:25,289
<i>Well, you look like a gentleman.</i>

469
01:06:25,373 --> 01:06:26,791
<i>Why not?</i>

470
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:37,635
<i>I am the Countess Lisl Von Schlaf.</i>

471
01:06:37,718 --> 01:06:39,720
<i>My name is Bond.</i>

472
01:06:39,804 --> 01:06:44,100
<i>I'm writing a novel
about Greek smugglers. Know any?</i>

473
01:06:44,183 --> 01:06:47,436
<i>Smugglers? How would I know
any smugglers?</i>

474
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,774
<i>I would think that
a lady in your position...</i>

475
01:06:51,816 --> 01:06:53,901
<i>would get to know many things.</i>

476
01:06:53,985 --> 01:06:55,486
<i>I'd be most grateful.</i>

477
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:57,321
<i>How grateful?</i>

478
01:06:57,405 --> 01:06:58,614
<i>Very.</i>

479
01:06:58,698 --> 01:07:01,742
<i>I adore grateful men.</i>

480
01:07:32,356 --> 01:07:35,026
<i>May I call you tomorrow, Countess?</i>

481
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:38,446
<i>I'm a night person. I have
champagne and oysters in the fridge.</i>

482
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:40,448
<i>Why not come in for a bite?</i>

483
01:07:44,368 --> 01:07:47,580
<i>I won't need you anymore tonight.</i>

484
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:16,359
<i>- Cheers.
- Bottoms up.</i>

485
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:23,699
<i>Whoops!</i>

486
01:08:23,741 --> 01:08:26,285
<i>Me nightie's slipping.</i>

487
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:28,287
<i>So is your accent, Countess.</i>

488
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:32,834
<i>- Manchester?
- Close.</i>

489
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:35,378
<i>Liverpool.</i>

490
01:08:35,461 --> 01:08:37,171
<i>It was an amusing performance...</i>

491
01:08:37,255 --> 01:08:40,591
<i>between you and the owner of this.</i>

492
01:08:40,675 --> 01:08:42,885
<i>What exactly did Columbo whisper to you?</i>

493
01:08:42,927 --> 01:08:46,931
<i>That you're a spy.
To find out more about you.</i>

494
01:08:48,099 --> 01:08:49,517
<i>And have you?</i>

495
01:08:51,477 --> 01:08:53,396
<i>Have I ever.</i>

496
01:09:18,713 --> 01:09:23,009
<i>When you're ready to leave,
you can take my car.</i>

497
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:26,012
<i>That sounds like a dismissal.</i>

498
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:28,431
<i>I was looking forward to breakfast.</i>

499
01:10:09,222 --> 01:10:10,973
<i>Lisl, come back!</i>

500
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,550
<i>Get in... Ooh!</i>

501
01:10:58,271 --> 01:11:00,314
<i>Goodbye, Countess.</i>

502
01:11:04,735 --> 01:11:07,446
<i>What...</i>

503
01:11:50,031 --> 01:11:53,201
<i>- What should I do with you?
- You cannot just arrest him.</i>

504
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:55,453
<i>You must find a different way.</i>

505
01:11:55,536 --> 01:11:58,039
<i>You may have to kill him.</i>

506
01:11:58,122 --> 01:12:00,291
<i>- Does this discourage you?
- Huh?</i>

507
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:03,252
<i>Just tell me where he is.</i>

508
01:12:03,294 --> 01:12:08,341
<i>I'm here, Mr. Bond
of the British Secret Service.</i>

509
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,259
<i>But I'll tell you...</i>

510
01:12:10,343 --> 01:12:12,762
<i>it is Kristatos you want, not me.</i>

511
01:12:12,803 --> 01:12:15,932
<i>He told you about himself.</i>

512
01:12:16,015 --> 01:12:19,560
<i>He's the one
with the powerful connections.</i>

513
01:12:19,644 --> 01:12:21,771
<i>Locque works for him,
not for me.</i>

514
01:12:21,854 --> 01:12:25,983
<i>I smuggle, yes.
I smuggle gold, diamonds...</i>

515
01:12:26,067 --> 01:12:27,818
<i>cigarettes, pistachio nuts...</i>

516
01:12:27,902 --> 01:12:30,488
<i>but no heroin.</i>

517
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:33,950
<i>Sit down.
That I leave to him...</i>

518
01:12:34,033 --> 01:12:37,411
<i>when he is not too busy
working for Russia...</i>

519
01:12:37,495 --> 01:12:39,205
<i>against my country and yours.</i>

520
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:41,123
<i>My country awarded him the King's Medal.</i>

521
01:12:41,207 --> 01:12:44,961
<i>Yes, I know.
But other people died for it.</i>

522
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:47,922
<i>During the fighting in Crete,
he was a double agent.</i>

523
01:12:50,675 --> 01:12:53,427
<i>King's Medal.</i>

524
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:56,973
<i>I would laugh
if my heart was not so heavy...</i>

525
01:12:57,056 --> 01:12:58,766
<i>about my poor Lisl.</i>

526
01:13:00,852 --> 01:13:03,855
<i>What does Kristatos gain
by setting you up?</i>

527
01:13:03,938 --> 01:13:07,400
<i>Well, I know too much about him.</i>

528
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:10,027
<i>He wants me out of the way.</i>

529
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:15,741
<i>By using a British agent
to do his dirty work for him...</i>

530
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:18,077
<i>your government might
give him another medal.</i>

531
01:13:18,953 --> 01:13:22,874
<i>- Why should I believe you?
- I'll prove it to you tonight.</i>

532
01:13:22,957 --> 01:13:25,668
<i>We'll go together to his warehouse...</i>

533
01:13:25,751 --> 01:13:29,088
<i>in Albania, okay?</i>

534
01:13:29,964 --> 01:13:32,341
<i>If I don't report in by morning...</i>

535
01:13:32,383 --> 01:13:36,470
<i>not only my people, but the entire Greek
police will be down on you...</i>

536
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:37,930
<i>like a load of bricks.</i>

537
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,849
<i>Don't worry.</i>

538
01:13:39,891 --> 01:13:43,352
<i>By tomorrow,
we'll be good friends.</i>

539
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,732
<i>Let us drink to that.</i>

540
01:13:47,815 --> 01:13:50,151
<i>I'll wait till tomorrow.</i>

541
01:14:01,454 --> 01:14:04,165
<i>You may need this.</i>

542
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:07,460
<i>I'm a good judge of men.</i>

543
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:12,507
<i>Mr. Bond, you have
what the Greeks call tha'ros.</i>

544
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:14,133
<i>Guts.</i>

545
01:14:16,135 --> 01:14:17,553
<i>So have you, Mr. Columbo.</i>

546
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,188
<i>Cheers.</i>

547
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,919
<i>Santos' drug store.</i>

548
01:16:28,768 --> 01:16:30,186
<i>Watch it.</i>

549
01:16:46,077 --> 01:16:47,703
<i>J.I.M. Diving equipment...</i>

550
01:16:47,787 --> 01:16:50,748
<i>for salvage work
at depths of over 300 feet.</i>

551
01:17:05,429 --> 01:17:08,266
<i>- Raw opium.
- An old smuggler's trick.</i>

552
01:17:08,349 --> 01:17:10,893
<i>Kristatos knows them all.</i>

553
01:17:53,394 --> 01:17:56,230
<i>Get your men out of here.</i>

554
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:57,732
<i>Now.</i>

555
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:03,733
<i>You left this with Ferrara,
I believe.</i>

556
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:23,211
<i>Had no head for heights.</i>

557
01:21:53,259 --> 01:21:56,971
<i>Where did the St. Georges sink?</i>

558
01:21:57,013 --> 01:22:00,016
<i>We can't be sure for certain.
We know it was in this vicinity.</i>

559
01:22:00,057 --> 01:22:03,853
<i>Your father was
using the temple as a front.</i>

560
01:22:03,895 --> 01:22:06,147
<i>Kristatos killed your father...</i>

561
01:22:06,189 --> 01:22:09,066
<i>so he wouldn't find
the St. Georges before he did.</i>

562
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:13,821
<i>Kristatos.
How can I help?</i>

563
01:22:13,905 --> 01:22:17,241
<i>Where does your father
keep his daily log?</i>

564
01:22:17,325 --> 01:22:19,160
<i>Daily log.</i>

565
01:22:19,202 --> 01:22:23,831
<i>Father and he were pals for 30 years.
He repeats everything.</i>

566
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:29,921
<i>- Give us a kiss.
- What's his name?</i>

567
01:22:30,004 --> 01:22:32,340
<i>Max.</i>

568
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:33,841
<i>Thank you.</i>

569
01:22:35,718 --> 01:22:37,178
<i>Hello.</i>

570
01:22:40,973 --> 01:22:42,892
<i>It's all shorthand.</i>

571
01:22:42,934 --> 01:22:46,938
<i>He used a special kind.
Only I could decipher it.</i>

572
01:22:51,108 --> 01:22:54,070
<i>He made several surveys in Neptune.</i>

573
01:22:54,111 --> 01:22:56,447
<i>- What's Neptune?
- Our two-man submarine.</i>

574
01:22:58,407 --> 01:23:01,786
<i>He saw a diving bell here.</i>

575
01:23:01,869 --> 01:23:03,204
<i>Diving bell?</i>

576
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:07,083
<i>Oil exploration. Kristatos.</i>

577
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:13,130
<i>Three days later,
he sighted a wreck in the same area.</i>

578
01:23:14,215 --> 01:23:16,092
<i>And?</i>

579
01:23:16,133 --> 01:23:17,885
<i>That was his last entry.</i>

580
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:20,930
<i>The day he was killed.</i>

581
01:23:20,972 --> 01:23:26,310
<i>Air would be useless at this depth.
We need a mixture of oxygen and helium.</i>

582
01:23:26,394 --> 01:23:28,354
<i>I have the necessary equipment.</i>

583
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:31,941
<i>The less people that know,
the better.</i>

584
01:23:32,984 --> 01:23:35,987
<i>I'll give the crew shore leave
except for the mate and two others.</i>

585
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:37,864
<i>Let's go.</i>

586
01:25:04,826 --> 01:25:07,495
<i>584 feet.</i>

587
01:25:07,537 --> 01:25:13,292
<i>An oxygen-helium mix will give us
eight minutes. We'll have to work fast.</i>

588
01:25:13,376 --> 01:25:16,671
<i>Wouldn't the crew have destroyed
the transmitter?</i>

589
01:25:16,712 --> 01:25:19,257
<i>Only if they'd had the chance
to set the explosive timer.</i>

590
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:54,333
<i>We have a visitor below.</i>

591
01:26:01,674 --> 01:26:04,719
<i>Conserve your gas supply.
Speak only when necessary.</i>

592
01:26:56,562 --> 01:26:58,606
<i>I hope he was dining alone.</i>

593
01:27:23,673 --> 01:27:25,299
<i>Go back to the sub.</i>

594
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:27,176
<i>No, no. I'm staying.</i>

595
01:27:37,812 --> 01:27:40,481
<i>That should be the command cabin.</i>

596
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:04,172
<i>Eureka!</i>

597
01:28:13,472 --> 01:28:15,057
<i>"Main destruct timer...</i>

598
01:28:15,141 --> 01:28:18,436
<i>under lever right of ATAC housing,
dualled...</i>

599
01:28:18,519 --> 01:28:23,232
<i>by ring main circuit
through anti-handling charger. "</i>

600
01:28:23,316 --> 01:28:25,776
<i>The destruct timer's set
at one minute.</i>

601
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:28,488
<i>For some reason,
the lever wasn't pulled.</i>

602
01:28:34,827 --> 01:28:37,538
<i>The transmitter
with a thermite charge.</i>

603
01:28:54,013 --> 01:28:56,057
<i>Hold these.</i>

604
01:28:57,558 --> 01:28:59,310
<i>"To bypass trembler switch...</i>

605
01:28:59,393 --> 01:29:02,772
<i>cut wires in following procedure. "</i>

606
01:29:04,398 --> 01:29:05,650
<i>Cutters.</i>

607
01:29:25,628 --> 01:29:26,963
<i>Screwdriver.</i>

608
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:46,607
<i>That's it.
Let's get out of here.</i>

609
01:30:11,674 --> 01:30:13,509
<i>James, help!</i>

610
01:30:51,005 --> 01:30:53,841
<i>- James, I won't make it.
- We both will.</i>

611
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:00,431
<i>Get to the sub.
I'll stall him.</i>

612
01:34:23,092 --> 01:34:24,594
<i>Try and close the CO2.</i>

613
01:34:24,677 --> 01:34:26,429
<i>I'm trying.</i>

614
01:35:55,768 --> 01:35:59,564
<i>Careful, James.
It's 5,000 years old.</i>

615
01:36:38,352 --> 01:36:39,979
<i>Thank you, Mr. Bond.</i>

616
01:36:40,062 --> 01:36:42,398
<i>You have saved us
the trouble of disarming it.</i>

617
01:36:42,482 --> 01:36:46,027
<i>Apostis, take that.</i>

618
01:36:48,154 --> 01:36:49,864
<i>Where are my men?</i>

619
01:36:49,947 --> 01:36:52,033
<i>You will be joining them.</i>

620
01:36:52,116 --> 01:36:54,619
<i>Let the girl go.</i>

621
01:36:54,702 --> 01:36:56,829
<i>We'll double
whatever you're getting.</i>

622
01:36:56,913 --> 01:37:00,082
<i>I never go back on a deal.</i>

623
01:37:00,166 --> 01:37:03,044
<i>It would be bad
for my reputation.</i>

624
01:37:20,269 --> 01:37:22,897
<i>I will deliver it
and return with the money.</i>

625
01:37:22,939 --> 01:37:28,528
<i>The voice of the KGB. Our agreement
was that I designate the meeting place.</i>

626
01:37:28,611 --> 01:37:31,948
<i>After they pay,
I will give them the transmitter.</i>

627
01:37:31,989 --> 01:37:35,201
<i>It must not be let out of your sight.</i>

628
01:37:35,284 --> 01:37:38,913
<i>Nor mine. Where are we going?</i>

629
01:37:38,955 --> 01:37:40,998
<i>We will take the ATAC
to St. Cyril's.</i>

630
01:37:41,082 --> 01:37:44,585
<i>St. Cyril's.
I'll arrange the pickup.</i>

631
01:37:51,092 --> 01:37:56,597
<i>Bind that wound.
We don't want blood in the water yet.</i>

632
01:37:56,681 --> 01:37:58,057
<i>Murderer.</i>

633
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:02,228
<i>You have shot your last bolt,
Miss Havelock.</i>

634
01:38:06,649 --> 01:38:08,776
<i>Leave their legs free.</i>

635
01:38:08,818 --> 01:38:09,986
<i>They'll make appetizing bait.</i>

636
01:38:19,996 --> 01:38:21,873
<i>I didn't think it
would end like this.</i>

637
01:38:21,956 --> 01:38:23,958
<i>We're not dead yet.</i>

638
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:52,028
<i>Hold tight.</i>

639
01:39:17,345 --> 01:39:19,555
<i>Turn around. We go again.</i>

640
01:39:24,894 --> 01:39:26,312
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

641
01:40:22,743 --> 01:40:24,120
<i>Again. Hurry.</i>

642
01:41:13,503 --> 01:41:15,546
<i>Help!</i>

643
01:41:17,465 --> 01:41:18,799
<i>Aw, leave him.</i>

644
01:41:21,928 --> 01:41:24,347
<i>Turn. Run them down.</i>

645
01:41:41,572 --> 01:41:42,782
<i>Follow me.</i>

646
01:42:26,576 --> 01:42:31,414
<i>Ahh. The sharks have them.
Make port.</i>

647
01:42:54,103 --> 01:42:55,605
<i>Thank you.</i>

648
01:42:55,688 --> 01:42:57,106
<i>Hello.</i>

649
01:43:00,276 --> 01:43:03,905
<i>- Give us a kiss.
- Max, not now.</i>

650
01:43:03,988 --> 01:43:06,741
<i>Kristatos is still alive.</i>

651
01:43:06,782 --> 01:43:10,453
<i>And probably headed
to Moscow or Havana by now.</i>

652
01:43:10,536 --> 01:43:12,580
<i>We'll never get him.</i>

653
01:43:12,663 --> 01:43:14,123
<i>Or the ATAC.</i>

654
01:43:14,165 --> 01:43:16,125
<i>ATAC to St. Cyril's.</i>

655
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:33,911
<i>Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.</i>

656
01:44:33,995 --> 01:44:37,331
<i>That's putting it mildly, 007.</i>

657
01:44:37,373 --> 01:44:40,835
<i>Your signal sent Whitehall into shock.</i>

658
01:44:40,877 --> 01:44:43,880
<i>So far we have managed to locate...</i>

659
01:44:43,963 --> 01:44:48,092
<i>439 St. Cyril's in Greece.</i>

660
01:44:48,176 --> 01:44:52,305
<i>Heaven only knows to which one
Kristatos took the ATAC.</i>

661
01:44:52,388 --> 01:44:55,850
<i>I know a well-informed person
to contact about that, Q.</i>

662
01:45:09,864 --> 01:45:13,117
<i>St. Cyril's, where we used to hide
from the Germans.</i>

663
01:45:13,201 --> 01:45:17,872
<i>Only Kristatos would make an abandoned
monastery his personal retreat.</i>

664
01:45:19,457 --> 01:45:22,001
<i>My friend, I've been studying
this place...</i>

665
01:45:22,084 --> 01:45:23,961
<i>for just such an occasion.</i>

666
01:45:25,254 --> 01:45:26,923
<i>We'll split here, huh?</i>

667
01:45:27,006 --> 01:45:31,135
<i>Your best approach is on the right face,
away from the building.</i>

668
01:45:31,219 --> 01:45:33,346
<i>Then you will have to make towards
the shed on the left...</i>

669
01:45:33,429 --> 01:45:36,974
<i>which houses the basket
and the electronic winch.</i>

670
01:45:37,058 --> 01:45:39,811
<i>It can be operated
only from the shed.</i>

671
01:45:39,894 --> 01:45:41,646
<i>Good luck.</i>

672
01:45:51,739 --> 01:45:53,366
<i>Should have brought more people.</i>

673
01:45:53,449 --> 01:45:56,410
<i>- James is counting on surprise.
- But we are only five men.</i>

674
01:45:56,494 --> 01:45:58,120
<i>And one woman.</i>

675
01:46:50,006 --> 01:46:51,966
<i>Eighteen...</i>

676
01:46:52,008 --> 01:46:53,551
<i>nineteen...</i>

677
01:46:53,634 --> 01:46:55,803
<i>twenty.</i>

678
01:46:55,845 --> 01:46:57,263
<i>Fifty more.</i>

679
01:46:57,346 --> 01:47:01,684
<i>That's the pits! I'm supposed to
be skating in Oslo, in Innsbruck.</i>

680
01:47:01,767 --> 01:47:03,519
<i>Why are we in this creepy place?</i>

681
01:47:03,603 --> 01:47:08,024
<i>Our plans are changed. We are
going to live in Cuba for a few months.</i>

682
01:47:08,107 --> 01:47:11,194
<i>- Cuba!
- You can skate without distractions.</i>

683
01:47:11,277 --> 01:47:12,528
<i>I'll be your audience.</i>

684
01:47:12,612 --> 01:47:17,033
<i>What a drag.
I want to win the gold medal.</i>

685
01:47:17,116 --> 01:47:18,201
<i>We all want that.</i>

686
01:47:19,076 --> 01:47:20,578
<i>I know what you want.</i>

687
01:47:20,661 --> 01:47:23,748
<i>But you're too old for me.
I'm splitting.</i>

688
01:47:24,665 --> 01:47:29,545
<i>- You have poisoned her against me!
- Don't blow your top, Ari.</i>

689
01:47:29,629 --> 01:47:33,341
<i>- Leave her alone.
- I will deal with you...</i>

690
01:47:33,382 --> 01:47:36,344
<i>as I deal with everyone who betrays me.</i>

691
01:47:45,603 --> 01:47:47,688
<i>Bibi...</i>

692
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:49,690
<i>you're so young.</i>

693
01:47:51,234 --> 01:47:53,402
<i>You must have a sponsor.</i>

694
01:47:53,486 --> 01:47:55,404
<i>I'll find another one.</i>

695
01:47:55,446 --> 01:47:57,198
<i>Go outside and check the guards.</i>

696
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:00,368
<i>Let me know when the helicopter arrives.</i>

697
01:53:14,599 --> 01:53:16,767
<i>One of Kristatos' killers.</i>

698
01:55:59,972 --> 01:56:01,390
<i>- Aah!
- Shut him up.</i>

699
01:56:06,687 --> 01:56:08,648
<i>Get the door.</i>

700
01:56:13,736 --> 01:56:17,114
<i>Come on, George. Let's go.</i>

701
01:56:18,908 --> 01:56:21,953
<i>Hurry, unless you want me
to go without you.</i>

702
01:56:22,036 --> 01:56:24,539
<i>You know,
I will never leave you.</i>

703
01:56:27,875 --> 01:56:30,670
<i>Your general is late.</i>

704
01:56:30,711 --> 01:56:33,256
<i>Only bad weather would delay him.</i>

705
01:56:47,436 --> 01:56:49,564
<i>Cover the windows.</i>

706
01:56:49,647 --> 01:56:51,732
<i>Let's go.</i>

707
01:56:51,816 --> 01:56:53,860
<i>He's all right. Leave him.</i>

708
01:57:01,617 --> 01:57:03,327
<i>He's all right.</i>

709
01:57:03,411 --> 01:57:05,204
<i>Back!</i>

710
01:57:13,629 --> 01:57:15,214
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

711
01:57:16,382 --> 01:57:19,010
<i>I'll be with you.</i>

712
01:57:19,093 --> 01:57:20,052
<i>Sorry.</i>

713
01:57:32,565 --> 01:57:34,984
<i>Cover the door!</i>

714
01:57:35,067 --> 01:57:37,862
<i>Where's Kristatos?
And keep your voice down.</i>

715
01:57:37,945 --> 01:57:41,407
<i>We are leaving him.
He mustn't know until we're gone.</i>

716
01:57:41,449 --> 01:57:43,075
<i>We'll help you if you help us.</i>

717
01:57:45,786 --> 01:57:47,205
<i>Come.</i>

718
01:57:58,549 --> 01:58:00,259
<i>Where are the guards?</i>

719
01:58:00,343 --> 01:58:02,094
<i>That way.</i>

720
01:58:02,136 --> 01:58:04,096
<i>Wait here.</i>

721
01:58:53,771 --> 01:58:55,690
<i>Move!</i>

722
01:58:58,651 --> 01:59:02,238
<i>- Where's Kristatos?
- The other side of the courtyard.</i>

723
01:59:02,321 --> 01:59:04,824
<i>You better stay here.</i>

724
01:59:13,166 --> 01:59:15,793
<i>What have you done to Brink?</i>

725
01:59:15,877 --> 01:59:18,379
<i>- Go back to your room!
- You can go to hell!</i>

726
01:59:51,245 --> 01:59:53,581
<i>Drop it.</i>

727
02:01:15,788 --> 02:01:17,540
<i>- Where's Kristatos?
- He's left with the ATAC.</i>

728
02:01:29,719 --> 02:01:31,804
<i>You're going to pay for it.</i>

729
02:01:31,846 --> 02:01:34,682
<i>You're not as fast
as you used to be.</i>

730
02:01:47,195 --> 02:01:49,322
<i>No, Melina,
that's not the answer.</i>

731
02:01:50,698 --> 02:01:52,283
<i>We'll turn him over
to the Greek police.</i>

732
02:01:52,366 --> 02:01:54,327
<i>Out of my way, James.</i>

733
02:01:55,244 --> 02:01:57,205
<i>All right...</i>

734
02:01:57,246 --> 02:01:59,832
<i>but be prepared to dig
those two graves.</i>

735
02:02:37,286 --> 02:02:39,622
<i>That's detente, comrade.</i>

736
02:02:39,705 --> 02:02:42,416
<i>You don't have it.
I don't have it.</i>

737
02:03:15,908 --> 02:03:18,494
<i>It seems as though Bibi
has a new sponsor.</i>

738
02:03:29,005 --> 02:03:30,715
<i>- How's it going?
- I've patched through...</i>

739
02:03:30,798 --> 02:03:33,050
<i>a high security line
to the satellite.</i>

740
02:03:33,134 --> 02:03:34,802
<i>We can try Bond now.</i>

741
02:03:34,886 --> 02:03:36,929
<i>Good. Are you through to Number 10?</i>

742
02:03:36,971 --> 02:03:39,098
<i>Standing by, sir.</i>

743
02:03:43,144 --> 02:03:44,854
<i>You know what I'd like?</i>

744
02:03:46,439 --> 02:03:48,691
<i>I can't imagine.</i>

745
02:03:48,774 --> 02:03:50,943
<i>A moonlight swim.</i>

746
02:03:55,156 --> 02:03:56,782
<i>007, are you there?</i>

747
02:04:07,084 --> 02:04:08,628
<i>Bond, are you there?</i>

748
02:04:11,589 --> 02:04:13,633
<i>For your eyes only, darling.</i>

749
02:04:19,514 --> 02:04:22,099
<i>- He's there.
- Patch in the prime minister.</i>

750
02:04:26,270 --> 02:04:28,189
<i>I'll get it, Denis.</i>

751
02:04:31,067 --> 02:04:32,151
<i>Hello.</i>

752
02:04:32,235 --> 02:04:34,403
<i>Mr. Bond on the line,
Prime Minister.</i>

753
02:04:34,487 --> 02:04:36,572
<i>Ah, Mr. Bond...</i>

754
02:04:36,656 --> 02:04:40,993
