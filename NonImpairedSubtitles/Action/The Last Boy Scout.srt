1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,513
But Alex lived for 17 minutes
in an incubator.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,753
He fell asleep.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,036
Had time for one dream.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,759
Then he died.

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,909
I think about him all the time.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,234
I threw for 300 yards that day.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,515
While my wife and kid were dying...

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,831
...I had the game of my life.

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,559
Life sucks.

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,037
Can I use your shower?

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,108
Bathroom's down the hall
on the right.

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,634
Here's a towel.

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,674
This what you looked for at Cory's?

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,152
This what you were looking for?

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,789
-That's $ 1000 worth of shit!
-Shut up!

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,192
Get the fuck out of my house
before I break your neck.

17
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,759
I use it to get by.

18
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,874
I don't use it.
I get by.

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,799
Get dressed and get out.

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,712
All right. I forgot.

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,235
Talking to Dudley-fucking-Do-right!

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,875
That shit happens real easy.

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,072
lt starts out...

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,794
...painkillers.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,316
Using Demerol because
your knees are shot!

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,918
Before you know it, you're chewing
codeine with breakfast.

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,396
Then a truck comes out of nowhere...

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,952
...and you're talking to God,
saying, "Help me out, Big Guy.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,555
I pay taxes and go to church.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,512
What's with this
dead wife and kid shit?"

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,872
But He ain't answering.

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,435
He ain't taking calls that day.

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,717
Instead, I get a call
from the fucking league.

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,515
They're saying,
"Kid, your career's over. "

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,673
I say, "Why?"

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,751
Because I gambled.

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,550
Why is there an injury report
in pro football?

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,439
Nobody else has one.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,511
But pro football does.

40
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,199
You know why?

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,514
That's so gamblers will have
an accurate spread!

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,669
It's all business. They push
until you blow your brains out.

43
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,955
Like Billy Cole!

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,997
Can't you see the hypocrites
took away my life!

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,117
When you're done pitying yourself,
the door's that way.

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,393
You bastard.

47
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,353
And then some.

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,029
Sign my card?

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,638
Sorry I was so bitchy before.

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,710
-Your dad's pretty pissed.
-He'll get over it.

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,512
You were his biggest hero.

52
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,269
Since when?

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,636
Since I was little.
You should've heard him.

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,713
"Jimmy this, Jimmy that.
Best quarterback in the game. "

55
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,389
When you got busted, he quit watching.

56
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,790
Does he punch all his heroes?

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,593
Who are you?

58
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,872
-This is the guy? You sure?
-It's him.

59
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,071
The kid with the million-dollar arm?

60
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,514
Don't look like much.

61
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,990
Which of you looks more like my dick?

62
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,073
Say what you got to say,
or get out of my way.

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,674
Grab him.

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,311
It's okay, folks!

65
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,119
It's okay. It's okay.

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,237
Thank you. Thank you.

67
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,119
Danger is my middle name.

68
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,438
Don't try this at home.
I'm a trained professional.

69
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,908
There's me...

70
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,311
...and there's Super Dave.

71
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,351
-I got bad news and bad news.
-Give me the bad news first.

72
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,279
Someone bounced Jimmy Dix off a car.

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,915
Now give me the bad news.

74
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,674
I got a statement
from Hallenbeck's neighbor.

75
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,668
The day he died, Mike Matthews
came to Hallenbeck's house...

76
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,353
...to discuss a case.

77
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,709
So Hallenbeck says.

78
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,394
How come Hallenbeck's neighbor claims...

79
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,200
...Matthews' car was
in the same spot all night?

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,638
Why did he lie?

81
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,554
Matthews is fucking his wife.

82
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,069
That's why the car was there.
Matthews was fucking his wife.

83
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,231
Hallenbeck just got back to town.

84
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,436
Christ!

85
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,279
Joe wasted the bastard himself.

86
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
He waltzed right out of my office.

87
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,237
I let the son of a bitch go.

88
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,357
Give me a chance. I'll get him.

89
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,908
Tommy.

90
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,712
You can go to a party when you're 17.

91
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,789
Morning, Joseph.

92
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,952
We got trouble, Milo.

93
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,392
Pick up his gun by the trigger guard.

94
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,595
Give it to me.

95
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,518
ls there a problem?

96
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,077
Yes, there is. Apparently,
there are too many bullets in this gun.

97
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,112
Fingerprints.

98
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,999
Naughty boy, Joseph.

99
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,918
You just shot a policeman.

100
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,031
It's you, Daddy.

101
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,555
He's awake.

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,115
Make sure.

103
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,314
I'm awake.

104
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,358
You nearly broke my wrist.

105
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,230
Milo warned us to watch out for him.

106
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,953
Fuck that! Fuck you.

107
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,197
Look at him. He's nothing.
Guy's a piece of shit.

108
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,870
Got a cigarette?

109
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,314
Cigarette? Sure.

110
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,719
I got a cigarette.

111
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,475
Got a light?

112
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,752
Yeah, I got a light.

113
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,789
Hey, I thought you were tough.

114
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,908
He's not so bad.

115
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,199
I dropped my cigarette.

116
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,879
May I have another?

117
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,468
Sure.

118
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,673
Sure thing, buddy.

119
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,872
I'm going to need a light.

120
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,072
Touch me again, I'll kill you.

121
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,470
Bamba! Baby!

122
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,396
Oh, baby! Two for two!

123
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,193
We got a two for two!

124
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,150
Told you!

125
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,278
Jesus Christ!

126
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,596
You fucking killed him!

127
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,068
He's dead!

128
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,679
ls there a problem?

129
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,272
He just killed him! He put his
fucking nose through his brain!

130
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,675
I needed a light.

131
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,669
Joseph, you don't disappoint me.

132
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,470
You took an awful risk.
Pablo could have shot you dead.

133
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,274
If you wanted me dead,
you'd have killed me already.

134
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,273
That's true.

135
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,069
-Can we do a formal introduction?
-Who gives a fuck?

136
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,589
You're the bad guy.

137
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,274
I am the bad guy.

138
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,875
And I'm supposed to
tremble with fear?

139
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,235
Something like that.

140
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,838
Fine. I'll start trembling
in a minute.

141
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,395
ln the meantime,
could I have a drink?

142
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,312
I don't see why not.

143
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,991
Take the corpse away,
and fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink.

144
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,349
Make that two.

145
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,360
If it isn't Shelly Marcone himself.

146
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,199
Careful, son.

147
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,992
Just my friends call me Shelly.

148
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,995
You got friends?
When did this happen?

149
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,752
You sure are feisty for
a fellow in your position.

150
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,759
Teach him some manners.

151
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,158
Touch me again, I'll kill you.

152
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,469
What fucking conspiracy
are you talking about?

153
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,159
Hallenbeck's a fruit loop.

154
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,635
He's been after
Senator Baynard for years.

155
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,877
You want me to believe the
senator's mixed up in this?

156
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,791
I'll say it again for
the cheap seats, lieutenant.

157
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,795
I don't know where Joe is!
That's my fucking statement!

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,309
Write it down and shove it up your ass.

159
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,313
I could nail you for obstruction.

160
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,918
You couldn't nail a $2 whore.
Charge me with something or let me out!

161
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,117
My husband did not kill a cop!

162
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,956
Aside from that, I can't help you.
May we go now?

163
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,440
Can I have a minute with
your mom in private?

164
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,795
Pleasure.

165
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,839
Do you deny being sexually involved...

166
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,190
...with Matthews prior to his death?

167
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,440
Why am I calling?
I had to hear your sweet voice.

168
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,039
And I need a favor.

169
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,838
No, it ain't like that.

170
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,713
No, it wasn't no liquor talking.

171
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,639
You're not fat.
You're just a whole lot of woman.

172
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,114
Do me a favor, big mama.

173
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,437
Senator Calvin Baynard.
He's a season ticket holder.

174
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,190
Punch up the address
where you send the tickets.

175
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,594
Good girl.

176
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,753
Don't worry. I'll find him.

177
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,756
How?

178
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,598
When in doubt,
try the nearest bad guy.

179
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,796
Football is a dying beast, Joe.

180
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,552
No heroes left.

181
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,994
Not anymore.

182
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,196
Since old Sonny Werblin paid $400,000
to Joe Namath in '66...

183
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,715
...the bastards have gotten greedier.

184
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,674
God Almighty, when's it enough?

185
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,633
Jesus! Free agents!

186
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,638
"Give me, give me, give me! "

187
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,196
Now you got guys on PCP,
shooting themselves on the field.

188
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,638
The American public's tired of it,
and they're changing the channel.

189
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,912
The ratings are down.

190
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,638
So you'll bribe senators
to legalize gambling.

191
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,480
Legalize sports gambling.

192
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,469
You see, with all the heroes gone...

193
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,752
...only legalized gambling
will save the beast.

194
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,073
You follow me?

195
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,436
We're talking about big bucks.

196
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,398
We're talking billions.

197
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,710
That's nine zeroes, son.

198
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,308
I'm not your fucking son.

199
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,598
Have you ever heard of
the Senate's Commission...

200
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,479
...to investigate gambling
in pro sports?

201
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,949
ls that who you're paying off?

202
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,551
The Commission votes in March.

203
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,679
I got them all in my hip pocket,
except Senator Calvin Baynard.

204
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,309
I tried to bribe that son of a bitch.

205
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,872
He gave it back because
it wasn't enough.

206
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,550
-What's he want?
-6 million.

207
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,195
Or he'll go straight to the police.

208
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,879
It'll just be cheaper to
kill that son of a bitch.

209
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,597
Taking off a senator is ballsy,
even for an asshole like you.

210
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,672
You said it, Joe-boy.

211
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,276
That's why we'll frame you
for the senator's murder.

212
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,437
<i>As chairman of the Commission,</i>
<i>I'll simply say this:</i>

213
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,839
I'm reviewing both sides of the issue
with utmost care...

214
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,388
...and scrutiny.

215
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,868
I will adopt a position...

216
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,509
...based on what is best for the sport.

217
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,239
ln the meantime...

218
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,713
...I can't wait to get to the Coliseum
to watch my favorite team...

219
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,235
...kick hell out of Tampa Bay.

220
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,918
Thank you, senator.

221
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,151
Always a pleasure.

222
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,311
Come on, Jimmy, think, think, think!
What would Joe do?

223
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,869
He'd shoot everybody
and smoke cigarettes.

224
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,109
But I have no gun.

225
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,794
-How'd you get here?
-I hitched.

226
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,794
I meant, how did you find me?

227
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,435
My dad's a detective.
What can I say?

228
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,594
You didn't cover your tracks.
You're easy to trace.

229
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,031
Just what I need: Nancy-fucking-Drew!

230
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,679
I brought you this.

231
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,353
Where did you get that?!

232
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,953
Stole it from Dad's closet.

233
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,633
He'd kill me if he knew.

234
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,791
You'll kill yourself first, you jerk.

235
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,914
Take this ugly monkey
and get out of here.

236
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,399
I want to know what's going on.

237
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,158
Watch CNN. Go!

238
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,468
Those are the bodyguards
from the picture.

239
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,909
They're leaving without the senator.
Now go!

240
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,434
I'm coming too.

241
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,517
You can't come. Go home.

242
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,670
Kiss my ass.

243
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,316
Kiss my ass!

244
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,073
ls that clear enough?

245
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,676
Fine!

246
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,472
You little brat.

247
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,470
We'll only follow.
How dangerous can that be?

248
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,114
We're in position.

249
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,029
The senator's men are en route.
ETA, five minutes.

250
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,431
Now where you going?

251
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,990
Let's find out.

252
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,916
Here.

253
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,154
I told you no guns, right?
I hate guns.

254
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,513
Stay here. I'll go look around.
Stay!

255
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,990
Six mil.

256
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,309
Excuse me.

257
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,309
Did any of you stupid shits
bother to frisk this fuck?!

258
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,473
He could be a goddamn cop.
Will you frisk him?

259
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,679
Take it easy.

260
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,951
Hand him the briefcase, Joseph.

261
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,876
Nice suit.

262
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,794
Was that briefcase
loaded with explosives?

263
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,436
1 0 pounds of C-4,
going to the Coliseum now.

264
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,036
It's ironic, don't you think?

265
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,478
This bomb will be delivered
to Baynard by his own bodyguards.

266
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,235
After his death, the police
will receive a photograph of you...

267
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,599
...handing over the case.

268
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,076
You'll be blamed for the crime.

269
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,559
They'll believe it.

270
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,513
-They know you're a fan of Baynard's.
-Go fuck yourself.

271
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,230
That's not polite.

272
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,675
It's very abusive sounding.

273
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,512
What would you do...

274
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,873
...if somebody told you
to go fuck yourself?

275
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,274
Would you cut one of their eyes out?

276
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,914
What would you do?

277
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,350
You think you're so fucking cool.

278
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,155
You think you're so fucking cool!

279
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,671
This once...

280
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,916
...I'd like to hear you scream...

281
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,673
...in pain!

282
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,557
Play some rap music.

283
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,835
Hey, Flash.

284
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,595
Rescue attempt?

285
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,949
Blow me.

286
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,555
You must be James.

287
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,632
He does that with everybody.

288
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,949
Calls me Joseph.

289
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,155
You're alone?

290
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,994
No, I got the
Vienna Boys Choir with me.

291
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,679
ls everybody stupid here?

292
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,035
Just you.

293
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,349
Shoot them, bury them.

294
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,030
Scared?

295
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,793
Shitless. You?

296
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,796
More or less.

297
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,356
Hey, mister!

298
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,989
Like my puppet?

299
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,789
Get her out of here.

300
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,951
My name is Furry Tom.

301
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,633
I said go, kid.

302
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,676
Kid stays.

303
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,148
Can you make him talk?

304
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,391
Go on. Try.

305
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,074
Go ahead. Take it.

306
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,195
It's riddle time.

307
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,115
Why did Mr. Milo cross the road?

308
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,199
I don't know. Why?

309
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,079
Because his dick was stuck
in a chicken.

310
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,708
Fur ball?

311
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,552
This is the first pussy
you guys have seen in a long time.

312
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,233
Especially this fat fuck.

313
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,076
Where'd you get the suit?
Gangsters "R" Us?

314
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,474
Why is she here?!

315
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,033
It's not his fault!

316
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,754
I'll kill you both!

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,035
Get in line.

318
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,276
Here.

319
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,509
What do I do with it?

320
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,034
Point it and shoot!

321
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,309
Keep down!

322
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,353
Any bright ideas?

323
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,396
Go fast!

324
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,516
Good idea!

325
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,670
Push this fuck off the road!

326
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,753
Put your seat belts on!

327
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,194
This is bad!

328
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,910
Very bad!

329
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,949
You all right?

330
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,314
Shit!

331
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,912
Any chance he's alive?

332
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,919
Not now.

333
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,475
Call the cops!

334
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,756
Say there's a bomb at the Coliseum!

335
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,275
Senator Baynard's in danger!
You got it?

336
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,234
Happy birthday.
Buy yourself a new pair of pants.

337
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,317
Let's get the bomb before
it gets Baynard.

338
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,470
Got a car?

339
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,677
Do you got a car?

340
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,591
The keys.

341
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,597
No.

342
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,831
Give me the keys or I shoot the kid.

343
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,950
Daddy!

344
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,879
You're the dumbest guy in the world.

345
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,031
You save the guy that ruined
your career...

346
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,271
...and avenge the guy that
fucked your wife.

347
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,478
The girl said her dad's name
is Joe Hollen--

348
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,356
He stole my car and went
to the Coliseum.

349
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,519
He set my pool on fire.
The man is a lunatic!

350
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,989
Give me 10 black-and-whites.
He's going to the Coliseum.

351
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,870
If we go any faster,
we'll travel back in time.

352
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,550
There!

353
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,156
Pull up and I'll yell at them.

354
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,798
I'll yell at them.

355
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,553
That's a lame plan!

356
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,556
Can we try?

357
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,870
Bulletproof glass.
He won't hear you.

358
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,351
-What're you doing?
-Drawing a picture.

359
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,669
-Of what?
-A bomb.

360
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,911
lt looks like an apple with lines.

361
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,436
"Don't open the briefcase,
it's full of fruit. "

362
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,113
You want to draw it?

363
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,715
Happy?

364
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,949
You kidding?

365
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,678
Always criticizing!

366
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,716
I forgot.

367
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,918
"Bom" is "fuck you" in Polish.

368
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,639
It's not funny.
I almost bought it.

369
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,957
Tragic loss to the art world.

370
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,234
You'll lose them.

371
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,714
Buckle your seat belt.

372
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,870
It's broken!

373
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,437
I swear, if I survive this case,
I'll dance a jig.

374
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,199
I'll dance a jig.

375
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,833
There! There!

376
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,996
The off-ramp we just passed!

377
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,270
Where you going?
What are you doing?

378
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,555
Ain't I a bitch?

379
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,679
Now do we go to the cops?

380
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,989
I'll think about it.

381
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,309
Expecting a call?

382
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,078
Hey, motherfucker.

383
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,871
Where are you, bottom of the pool?

384
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,479
<i>On my way to the ball game.</i>

385
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,469
Someone here wants to talk to you.

386
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,793
Hi, Daddy.

387
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,590
<i>I'm okay. I'm not hurt.</i>

388
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,594
You back off...

389
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,400
...or I'll show your daughter
what a hot date I am.

390
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,834
-What happened?
-He has Darian.

391
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,830
What do we do?

392
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,600
We take Marcone.
It's the only way.

393
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,438
We do nothing,
they'll kill her anyway.

394
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,355
Careful with that case.
lt goes "bang. "

395
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,195
Look at all this.

396
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,236
Shredders.

397
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,395
Police and the DEA use it to blow locks.

398
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,278
They explode on impact.

399
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,636
Kill everything within 10 feet.

400
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,198
Put this on. Get in.
You in or out?

401
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,112
I'm in.
What can I lose?

402
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,473
We're going to a ball game.

403
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,996
That's Marcone's car.

404
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,036
Come on.

405
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,917
-Always wanted to do that.
-Should've shit on it.

406
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,634
I forgot to tell you,
you're wanted for murder.

407
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,071
Mr. Dix.
Long time no see!

408
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,639
Yeah, too long.

409
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,992
-We're going to see Mr. Marcone.
-Sure, go ahead.

410
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,153
Jimmy, you bastard!
You broke my nose!

411
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,989
What are you doing here?
You were kicked off the team!

412
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,192
How'd you like to be kicked
off the planet?

413
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,311
Have a nice game.

414
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,554
How you doing?

415
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,954
You are one dumb bastard.

416
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,709
You know that?

417
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,030
I guess we won't dance that jig.

418
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,909
You okay?

419
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,516
Of course she is.
She's been with Uncle Shelly.

420
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,875
I'm okay.

421
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,828
Lose the guns.

422
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,712
Take off your coats. Relax.

423
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,997
What do you think Baynard'll do...

424
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,270
...when he learns
you tried to kill him?

425
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,078
He doesn't have a chance.

426
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,272
Shortly, Milo will have him...

427
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,597
...in the sights of
a high-powered rifle.

428
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,512
Where's he shooting from?

429
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,716
You never run out of questions.

430
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,239
Let's just say...

431
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,631
...Milo's in a highly
enlightened position.

432
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,319
Why'd you kill Cory?

433
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,873
She took to blackmail.
I have no truck with that.

434
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,994
She's one of the sweetest whores
I ever tasted.

435
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,149
There's 5 feet of marble
between me and you.

436
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,391
Maybe I make it, maybe I don't.

437
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,558
You call her "whore" again,
I'll find out.

438
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,075
Jimmy, do what you got to do.

439
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,753
Take it easy.

440
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,833
He should know.

441
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,110
With a face like that,
he must pay for it.

442
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,835
If you're fond of this little girl...

443
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,751
...keep your goddamn mouth shut!

444
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,638
Eat shit, you redneck!

445
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,349
Come here.

446
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,878
Goddamn, I'm really glad
to see you, Jimmy.

447
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,592
I still have that autographed ball...

448
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,870
...you gave me for my collection.

449
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,119
It's a shame about you.

450
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,789
You had the million-dollar arm, kiddo.

451
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,958
You got hooked on the--
What was it?

452
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,309
Demerol!

453
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,711
Because you couldn't stand the pain.

454
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,991
Couldn't take the pain.

455
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,668
Life is pain.

456
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,273
Walk it off, son.

457
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,509
Discipline.

458
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,834
Kids nowadays just don't
have no discipline.

459
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,952
Don't you cry, honey.

460
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,150
Come on.

461
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,072
Come sit in my chair.

462
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,150
Let her go.

463
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,473
Put them out of my misery.

464
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,868
There is the matter of the $6 million.

465
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,393
Unless you're not interested.

466
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,833
Let's humor this asshole.

467
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,434
Tell me.

468
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,396
Just me and Flash know where it is.

469
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,360
It's in the back of a white BMW.

470
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,873
We can take you to it.

471
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,953
Milo said the money was destroyed.

472
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,153
You're bluffing.

473
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,357
Think I'm bluffing?

474
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,115
I also have in my possession a tape.

475
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,157
You and Baynard.

476
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,914
Very juicy stuff.

477
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,270
Well, now, let me guess.

478
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,956
If something happens to you...

479
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,114
...that thing will be mailed
to the cops.

480
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,874
Close.
Actually, it goes to the mob.

481
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,756
They'd be interested to know
what you're up to.

482
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,752
Legalized gambling.

483
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,431
They stand to lose what?

484
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,074
Two and a half billion dollars?

485
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,396
They won't be upset about that.

486
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,273
Just their entire bookmaking income.

487
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,072
Go ahead and pull the trigger.

488
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,799
Be my guest.

489
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,636
Don't be surprised if you wake up
next to a stallion head.

490
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,874
If you had that goddamn tape
you'd have already told me.

491
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,028
This ain't working.

492
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,838
Take your best shot.

493
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,828
I ain't going out like that!
He's lying!

494
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,389
-The money's not in the car.
-Shut up!

495
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,636
It's in a locker.
And I got the key.

496
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,674
Where is it?

497
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,029
Stashed in my shorts.

498
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,112
Easy. Just easy.

499
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,553
Don't. He'll kill you!

500
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,711
He'll kill us anyway!

501
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,668
Promise to let me go.

502
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,553
Bullshit.

503
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,911
Give him the key or I'll kneecap you.

504
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,351
Nobody gets the money.
It's one of those new plastic keys.

505
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,589
Get the key!

506
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,478
The kind that shreds.

507
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,755
Get down!

508
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,354
Get her out!

509
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,235
I can't walk.

510
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,152
You going to pass out?

511
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,879
I'll make it.

512
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,032
Plastic keys?
The kind that shred?

513
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,111
Short notice.
Best I could do.

514
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,998
You did real good.

515
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,912
Learned from a pro.

516
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,556
Shit! You wasn't bluffing.

517
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,313
-Where's the senator's box?
-Section C. I'll show you.

518
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,353
Where's the senator's box?

519
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,796
Where's Milo?

520
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,911
"A highly enlightened position. "

521
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,116
He must be on those lights.

522
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,995
Find a cop and stay put.

523
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,318
You hear me?
Listen to Daddy, all right?

524
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,118
I'll be all right.

525
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,271
Do what I say.
Give me a kiss.

526
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,192
Go find a cop.

527
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,998
-What about me?
-Find Baynard.

528
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,275
Then what?

529
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,272
Get his attention.

530
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,309
Freeze!

531
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,109
A sniper's on that light!
He'll shoot Baynard!

532
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,190
Come on!

533
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,871
There he is! Jimmy Dix!

534
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,270
He pulled a gun on me.

535
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,555
You scum!

536
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,399
He's got a gun!

537
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,596
You bastard! You fuck!

538
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,349
Sit down!

539
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,359
Give me the ball!

540
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,318
Give me the fucking ball!

541
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,476
Thanks.

542
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,830
I said, "Sit down! "

543
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,679
<i>Put down your weapon!</i>

544
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,789
Looking for this?

545
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,595
Asshole!

546
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,150
I told you:

547
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,474
You ever touch me again,
I'll kill you!

548
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,073
What the hell is he doing?

549
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,470
I don't know.
ls he dancing?

550
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,991
Looks like he's dancing.

551
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,916
For a dancer,
he's one hell of a detective.

552
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,555
What's this I hear about Satan Claus?

553
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,109
You know about him too?

554
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,919
There! That's the man!

555
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,994
This bastard's been making
phone calls and harassing me!

556
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,273
I bet he stage-managed
the whole damn thing!

557
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,953
Arrest him!

558
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,274
Head or gut?

559
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,669
Excuse me?

560
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,509
Mom's here.

561
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,039
I missed you so much.

562
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,951
You know you're a real bastard?

563
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,079
And then some.

564
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,793
I'm sorry.

565
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,830
I'm so sorry.

566
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,318
Please forgive me.

567
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,390
I'll buy a dog.

568
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,833
Fuck you, Sarah.

569
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,470
Fuck you, Sarah.

570
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,994
If the cops weren't here,
I'd spit in your face.

571
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,152
Where's the briefcase they were
telling me about?

572
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,509
White BMW. Back seat.

573
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,473
Ain't a thing here.

574
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,836
Bingo!

575
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,236
Marcone's got the wrong one!

576
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,589
What?

577
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,072
What's next for us?

578
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,512
Tomorrow, I guess.

579
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,515
Take it one step at a time.

580
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,079
Daddy, can I go show Jimmy
to my friends?

581
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,319
-He's not a puppy.
-He's fucking famous.

582
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,033
You want to watch your mouth?

583
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,713
Come on, Dad.

584
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,793
Your father said, "Watch your mouth. "
Do it.

585
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,669
Yes, sir.

586
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,793
I like that.

587
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,240
I'm thinking I could use a partner.

588
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,119
You up for that?

589
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,715
I don't know anything
about being a detective.

590
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,433
There's nothing to it.

591
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,269
Since it's the 90s, you don't
just smack a guy in the face.

592
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,033
You say something cool first.

593
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,918
Like, "I'll be back. "

594
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,639
Only better than that.

595
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,917
Like, you hit him with a
surfboard and say, "Surf's up! "

596
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,116
Something like that.

597
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,588
What else?

598
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,398
That's about it.

599
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,711
Water's wet, the sky is blue...

600
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,839
...and old Satan Claus is out there,
just getting stronger.

601
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,638
What do we do about that?

602
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,359
Be prepared, son.

603
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,108
That's my motto. Be prepared.

604
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,389
