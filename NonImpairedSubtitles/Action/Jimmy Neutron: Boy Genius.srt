1
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,599
You better have
a look at this, sir.

2
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,838
- Commercial flight.
- No. Too fast, sir.

3
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,117
- One of our own?
- Air Force has nothing scheduled.

4
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:09,156
We've got ourselves a boogie.

5
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:31,830
Orange Leader to Delta Group.
Anticipate visual contact...

6
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:34,069
now.

7
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:37,188
Holy cow pie!

8
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:39,747
Hi! Nice antiques.

9
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:41,707
Gotta blast!

10
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:46,186
Fusion mix stable, engine cycling
at one million gigajoules.

11
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:48,185
Cool! We didn't blow up.

12
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:53,663
Great! Jimmy, I think
they want us to pull over.

13
00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:56,623
Nope. No time for that, Carl.
Stand by with the satellite.

14
00:01:56,702 --> 00:02:00,182
Okay. What do I do again?

15
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:02,141
you're the deployment system, Carl.

16
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:05,100
As soon as we clear the atmosphere,
you just throw it.

17
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,819
- Right.
- Prepare to leave the atmosphere!

18
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:15,856
Sorry about the toast, dear.
I had to make it in the oven.

19
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:18,856
- I can't find our toaster anywhere.
- Oh, looky!

20
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:22,854
Well, this oven toast
is brilliant, sugar booger.

21
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,694
And your yolks are
absolutely perfect too.

22
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:28,174
Oh, run away with me, my love.

23
00:02:29,852 --> 00:02:34,492
We'll take my car. your transmission
needs a new compression cuff.

24
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,051
Whatever. Ooh, this is a good one.
Quack, quack.

25
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,730
Would you try calling Jimmy?
He's going to miss the bus again.

26
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,688
Jimmy! Breakfast!
Time to come down!

27
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,807
Down, down, down, down, down, quack
Down, down, down, down, down, quack

28
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:49,847
Up, up, up!

29
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:52,686
Engaging pulse rockets now!

30
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,845
- No!
- Now?

31
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:07,002
Is this supposed to happen?

32
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:12,721
Come on, think, think, think!

33
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:21,677
Brain blast!

34
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:23,237
Give me your lunch!

35
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:27,316
Thanks, boy.

36
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:43,552
Don't try that at home.

37
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,589
Must engage stabilizers!

38
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,747
Now just a quick stop at my house.

39
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:03,346
I don't know, Jimmy. I gotta get to
school on time. Besides, you pro--

40
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:05,465
- Right. Gotcha.
- I didn't mean--

41
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:11,424
See you in homeroom!

42
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:15,103
Fasten your seat belt, Goddard.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

43
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:42,575
Well, what do you know.
The chimney fell off again.

44
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:45,574
That wasn't so bad, huh?

45
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,091
James Isaac Neutron!

46
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,130
I see you up there.

47
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,768
How many times have we told you
not to launch yourself off the roof?

48
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,928
Probably nine.
Exactly nine.

49
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:08,487
They say repetition is good
for a developing brain.

50
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:11,326
Then just what
do you think you're doing?

51
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:15,165
I received a message from space but
it was garbled in the ionosphere...

52
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:19,084
so I had to launch a communications
toaster-- I mean satellite.

53
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:22,043
Well, message from space? Wow!

54
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:24,322
Don't encourage him, Hugh.

55
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:28,642
Jimmy, we've repeatedly told you
not to talk to strangers.

56
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:34,480
Mom, I'm on the verge of contact
with an advanced alien civilization.

57
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:37,799
I don't care how advanced
they say they are, Jimmy.

58
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,798
If your father and I haven't
met them, they're strangers, right?

59
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:45,276
Well, except for policemen.
They're there to help you.

60
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:55,914
Oh, you gotta admit
that is pretty neat!

61
00:05:56,993 --> 00:06:00,033
But very unsafe, honey.
That's bad.

62
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:16,188
Deactivate pants!

63
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:29,184
Engage Gingivitis 2000.

64
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,138
Robo-Barber prototype, engage!

65
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,418
On-line.

66
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:49,977
Ta-da.

67
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,617
You rock.

68
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:57,255
You go, girl.

69
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:05,294
Shoe-bot!

70
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,569
- Oh.
- Sorry.

71
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:26,767
Bye, Goddard!

72
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:33,965
- Wait! I'm here!
- Good-bye, son! Have a good day!

73
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:37,924
Oh, Goddard!
Not on the porch!

74
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:41,962
Hey! Hey, wait!

75
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:48,001
Seems like the perfect opportunity
to try out the bubble gum mobile!

76
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:51,480
No, Jimmy, don't try it!
It's too soon.

77
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,639
Nonsense! All great inventions
need a test run.

78
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:06,755
All right!

79
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,988
- Right here!
- Look! Neutron's got another one.

80
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,147
Nice invention, "Nerdtron."

81
00:08:36,228 --> 00:08:39,066
Too bad somebody already
invented the bus.

82
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:41,546
Hey, guys!
I've got it down this time.

83
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,145
Internal combustion
is such old science.

84
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:47,384
Bubble travel is the way
of the future!

85
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:53,662
I guess trees are, like, the brakes?

86
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,019
Hello, Jimmy!

87
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,898
Oh, Carl.

88
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:10,897
Careful! Careful!

89
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,335
Thanks.

90
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,775
That's what I'm here for.

91
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,934
- What a day, huh?
- Look at the bright side, Carl:

92
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:26,292
The worst is behind us.

93
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:30,212
And my fossil-to-chromosome ratios
clearly demonstrate...

94
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:33,251
that female dinosaurs,
like this plesiosaurus...

95
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,930
were the stronger
and smarter of their species.

96
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,489
But, so, what else is new?

97
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,368
After class, I'll be happy
to demonstrate how boy dinosaurs...

98
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:46,647
got their butts kicked by
girl dinosaurs on a regular basis.

99
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:50,526
Excuse me, but the mandible crest
of Cindy's alleged plesiosaur...

100
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:52,525
is actually that
of a male megalosaur...

101
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:55,444
as defined by last week's
World Congress of Paleontologists.

102
00:09:55,524 --> 00:10:00,243
Those findings were inconclusive,
and you know it, Neutron!

103
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:02,722
Miss Fowl, what is the standard
for research...

104
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,001
on these extra-credit reports?

105
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:08,601
Um, yes, well, um--

106
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,839
Let's move along
to show-and-tell now, shall we?

107
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,078
This is Ultra Lord!

108
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,598
Sheen...

109
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:22,597
this is the seventh week in a row
you've shown Ultra Lord in class.

110
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:25,435
Miss Fowl, this one is different.

111
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:29,195
This Purple Vengeance version with
power fists and nuclear knees...

112
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:31,434
is in rare,
never-been-seen condition...

113
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:33,993
making it highly collectible.

114
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,792
Never-been-seen, huh? Then how
do you know it's even in there?

115
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,628
Hey, Jimmy.
Wanna see a frog?

116
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:54,987
That looks great!

117
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:58,386
Thanks. What are you drawing?

118
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:02,585
Fly Cycle modifications
for Goddard, second prototype.

119
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:05,224
Prototype, huh?

120
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:07,584
Oh, well, you know,
that looks good too.

121
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:09,743
- Thanks, Carl.
- Carl!

122
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:14,221
Would you please share with us
your show-and-tell?

123
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:16,661
Oh, okay.

124
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,620
This is my inhaler.

125
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,139
It provides fast-acting relief
of bronchial swelling...

126
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:25,699
due to asthma or allergies.

127
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:29,057
One touch of the button, and--

128
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:32,256
I can't see!

129
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:34,375
Thank you, Carl.

130
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:37,415
All right, next we have--

131
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:40,174
Nick!

132
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:48,811
yes, Nick.

133
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:51,851
you are a tad tardy again!

134
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,330
Oh, my. Am I?

135
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,609
It took me a while to copy my mom's
handwriting for this late note.

136
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:03,087
your show-and-tell, please.

137
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:07,366
How's it goin'? you know,
I don't really do show-and-tell.

138
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:10,885
Oh, oh, yes.
That's right.

139
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:12,565
Thank you, Nick.

140
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:16,244
Did you drop this?

141
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:20,563
yes, well, I, um--
My-- drop-- pencil.

142
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:27,200
We eagerly await
another one ofyour...

143
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:31,839
interesting show-and-tells.

144
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,238
As a matter of fact,
I brought my latest invention.

145
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,677
Behold the shrink ray!

146
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:42,476
What's the matter, Neutron--
aren't you short enough already?

147
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:45,076
Funny, Cindy.

148
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:48,034
But this device is more suited
to shrink something...

149
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:51,993
as vast as space itself
like, say, your mouth.

150
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,911
Help me! Help me!
I'm so tiny!

151
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:02,950
Just like Jimmy's brain!

152
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,909
So much for the Nobel Prize!

153
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:09,509
- Children, that's enough!
- Better luck next time!

154
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,987
It worked this morning.

155
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:14,627
I like your useless
shrink ray, Jimmy.

156
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:17,466
It's probably just
a programming error.

157
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:23,544
Oh, my!

158
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:33,141
Back, back, leviathan!

159
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:33,701
Come on, Jimmy. Some of the
greatest inventors of all time...

160
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:38,820
Come on, Jimmy. Some of the
greatest inventors of all time...

161
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,219
started as complete,
hopeless failures too.

162
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:45,737
Well, thank you, Carl.
I feel better, I think.

163
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:48,617
- I'm glad.
- That's good. Hey!

164
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:51,656
Retro Land Theme Park!
Check it out!

165
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:54,655
"Meet Ultra Lord live!"

166
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:58,574
Look! It's the state-of-the-art,
bone-warping gravity ride!

167
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:02,853
- I could hang out with Ultra Lord!
- And there's a petting zoo!

168
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:07,131
- Well, look at this!
- No! "Meet Ultra Lord live!"

169
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:09,811
Llamas and capybaras.

170
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:15,409
- Who cares? "Meet Ultra Lord live!"
- But I'm gonna touch a llama!

171
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:19,248
Guys, we have got to go
to the grand opening tonight.

172
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:20,768
yeah!

173
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:22,328
yeah.

174
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:25,286
But my folks won't let me
stay out after dark.

175
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,806
Well, it is a school night.

176
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:30,325
Pukin' Pluto, there's gotta be
something we can do.

177
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:32,325
It's the grand opening!

178
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:36,083
- Sneak out.
- What?

179
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:38,363
you heard me, dweebs.
Sneak out.

180
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:42,002
Well, yeah,
but my parents sorta told me--

181
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,840
Parents? What-- are you guys
gonna be kids forever?

182
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,160
What your parents don't know
won't hurt 'em, right?

183
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,198
But Nick, sneaking out
is so, so barbaric!

184
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,797
Whatever, Neutron. But there's
only one opening night...

185
00:14:56,878 --> 00:15:01,116
and anybody who matters
is gonna be there.

186
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:08,234
What do you think, Jimmy?

187
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:12,033
Nick has a point.
There is only one opening night.

188
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,273
Think, think, think.

189
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:17,712
Well, according to the
Newville Journal of Medicine...

190
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,991
monkeys are easily influenced
by positive reinforcement...

191
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,310
e.g., the giving of a banana.

192
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,788
And, since human and monkey DNA
only differ by two percent...

193
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:29,148
the same principle
should work on our parents.

194
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:31,268
My dad's allergic to bananas.

195
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,147
Oh, it's not the bananas,
it's the principle!

196
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:38,665
It's called psychology. All you
have to do is butter 'em up.

197
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:41,425
Give it a try.
I'll call you guys later.

198
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:45,183
We go to Retro Land tonight!

199
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:52,661
Look out!

200
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:55,860
Slow down!

201
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:08,737
I know!

202
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,775
Excuse me!
you through with that? Thanks!

203
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,174
A few oysters.

204
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:21,453
One lump of coal coming up!

205
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:25,852
- Thanks, Gus!
- Hi, Jimmy!

206
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,131
Excuse me!

207
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,766
Jimmy, is that you, dear?

208
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:48,005
yeah, Mom!
I'll be in in a second!

209
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:51,964
DNA match confirmed.
Welcome home, Jimmy.

210
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,244
Eliminate school smell.

211
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:56,723
Normal odor restored.

212
00:16:56,803 --> 00:17:00,842
- Thank you, Vox.
- You're welcome.

213
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:03,921
Warning. Entry tube
closed for maintenance.

214
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,038
- Thank you, Vox.
- You're welcome.

215
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:15,117
Here, Goddard.
Here, boy!

216
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:18,197
Here, Goddard!

217
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:23,995
Hey, look what I brought ya--
aluminum!

218
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:26,594
Do you want it?
Do you want it, huh?

219
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:29,433
Sit!

220
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:31,432
Roll over!

221
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:35,232
Play dead!

222
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,829
Mental note:
Fix bug in obedience program.

223
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:51,387
Good boy!

224
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,665
Okay, Goddard,
let's check the experiments.

225
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,099
The invisible hamsters
are looking great.

226
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,059
I think.

227
00:18:20,258 --> 00:18:22,498
Let's see how
the girl-eating plant is doing.

228
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,616
Nice choice...

229
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:32,655
as usual.

230
00:18:35,934 --> 00:18:38,734
The latest burping soda formula.

231
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:42,092
A guaranteed
one burp per sip.

232
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:51,050
Excuse you.

233
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:00,607
There's still no reply
to our satellite message.

234
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:02,607
Jeez, it's been a whole day.

235
00:19:02,686 --> 00:19:06,006
you'd think we would have heard from
an alien civilization by now, huh?

236
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,005
Oh, well. Come on, Goddard.

237
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,443
Say "ahh."

238
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,562
Add a little sand...

239
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:21,241
and in ya go!

240
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,838
I'm just an old lump of coal

241
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:37,356
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
Oh, yeah

242
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,556
Jimmy!

243
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:40,875
Hi, Mom!

244
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:44,314
Jimmy, you scared
the bejeebers out of me!

245
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,754
Oh, sorry about
your bejeebers, Mom.

246
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:51,673
- Might I add how lovely you look?
- I'm covered in transmission fluid.

247
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:56,151
Exactly! And might I say
filth never looked so good?

248
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,270
yes, well, how was
show-and-tell today?

249
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,949
It was okay. But first,
happy birthday, Mom!

250
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:05,508
Jimmy, these are beautiful!

251
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:08,587
But, sweetie,
it's not my birthday.

252
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:11,667
Oh, it's not?
Then whatever will I do...

253
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:15,386
with these lovely pearls
and priceless earrings?

254
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:17,825
These can't be real!

255
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:21,343
Oh, but they can, and they are!

256
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:27,182
And all these fabulous gifts
and prizes could be yours...

257
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:29,701
if you know the correct answer
to this question:

258
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:32,780
Please may I go
to Retro Land tonight?

259
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,500
- No, it's a school night.
- Thank you and might I say--

260
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:42,457
- Did you just say "no"?
- yes.

261
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:44,017
- yes!
- No.

262
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:45,377
- "No"?
- yes.

263
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,176
- yes!
-Jimmy--

264
00:20:47,217 --> 00:20:50,335
But-But--
all my friends are going...

265
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,655
and anybody who matters
is going to be there, Mom!

266
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:57,333
I matter, and your father matters,
and you matter.

267
00:20:57,413 --> 00:21:00,452
But you're not going.
Maybe we can go next weekend.

268
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:03,691
Wait. There must be something else
in here to change your mind.

269
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,329
No, Jimmy, no! Look out!
Look out, Jimmy! No!

270
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:17,967
Jimmy, be careful!

271
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:21,246
Mom, get me out!
I'm starting to get a little--

272
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:24,605
I didn't do it!

273
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:26,165
Stop, drop and roll!

274
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:27,685
Goddard!

275
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,042
Okay, Jimmy.
That's the last straw.

276
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:41,041
We have told you time and time again
about playing with rockets.

277
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:43,760
But, Mom, it's technically
not a rocket.

278
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,799
It's more of
a jet-pack-type thing.

279
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,039
I don't care
what type thing it is.

280
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:52,837
you just climb those
stair-type things right now.

281
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:56,996
your father will have a few words
to say to you when he gets home.

282
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:59,955
- It's not a rocket.
- March!

283
00:22:25,908 --> 00:22:27,347
yes!

284
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:33,866
The kingy loves his little orthgot.
Yes, he does.

285
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:36,704
Yes, he does. Yes, he does.

286
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:40,983
Yes, he does.

287
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:45,942
Sire, My king. It appears to be some
type of alien transmission device.

288
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:52,060
Tell me, when did it
become acceptable...

289
00:22:52,141 --> 00:22:55,539
to approach my royal throne
unannounced?

290
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:58,338
- Oh, yes, of course, my king--
- Space him!

291
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:09,696
Oh, wait!

292
00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:11,615
Whoa!

293
00:23:11,695 --> 00:23:15,053
Ooh! Oh, I missed it.

294
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,053
Can I-- Can I space another?

295
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:21,172
- Oh, please, brother?
- I said no, Ooblar.

296
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:23,051
Oh, please, oh, please.

297
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:25,370
I would love for that to stop.

298
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,890
Oh, please!

299
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,049
What have we here?

300
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,049
As the king's royal assistant...

301
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:35,008
I am the official checker
of the new things to be checked.

302
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:41,046
It's all right! It's all right.
I'll handle this.

303
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:43,085
Hello!

304
00:23:44,645 --> 00:23:48,084
What galaxy are you from?

305
00:23:48,164 --> 00:23:50,643
- Ooblar.
- Where is your leader?

306
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:53,963
Ooblar, stop it.
It's toast.

307
00:23:56,282 --> 00:23:58,361
Hello, Toast!

308
00:23:58,441 --> 00:24:02,840
I greatly admire your ship!

309
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,399
Beginning transmission from Earth.

310
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:10,757
Greetings from planet Earth.

311
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:14,876
I'm Jimmy Neutron.
and you're an alien life-form.

312
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:17,956
- Oh, what a bi g head.
- I welcome...

313
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:22,235
the exchange of scientific knowledge
and universal brotherhood.

314
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:27,153
This here is my dog. Goddard.

315
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:31,792
And this that you're looking at
is my room. That's where I sleep.

316
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:34,431
And this is my mom and dad
right here-- mom, dad.

317
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:37,270
Freeze that image!

318
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:46,427
They look delicious!

319
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:50,026
The search is over!

320
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:02,702
Dad, all my friends will be there!

321
00:25:02,783 --> 00:25:04,582
I know, son.

322
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:07,141
But if all your friends were named
Cliff, would you jump off them?

323
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:10,061
I don't think you would.
you see, Jimmy--

324
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,620
Jimmy, Jim, Jim, Jimmy.
Jim, James. Son...

325
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:17,339
let me tell you
a little about rockets.

326
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:19,778
Oh, they're
big-people things, son.

327
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:22,617
And you just can't go around
playing with big-people...

328
00:25:22,697 --> 00:25:25,376
fiery, flying things.

329
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:30,814
Because that's what rockets are.
Rockets are flying things.

330
00:25:30,854 --> 00:25:34,013
Well, I hope
this talk has helped.

331
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:41,531
Oh, and by the way, Mom says
you're grounded. Sorry!

332
00:25:41,612 --> 00:25:44,530
Oh! What good is it
to be a genius...

333
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:48,330
if you can't even
go out on a school night?

334
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:50,649
Goddard, options.

335
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:53,168
Apologize.
Your parents love you.

336
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:55,527
Next.

337
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:58,487
Create a time capsule.
Escape to the future.

338
00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:00,926
Oh. Take too long. Next.

339
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:03,685
Build Goddard a female poodle.

340
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:07,204
Goddard, this is serious!

341
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:09,003
Sneak out.

342
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:13,842
That's it! Barbaric problems
call for barbaric solutions.

343
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:15,362
Phone, please.

344
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,120
Carl? It's me.

345
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:21,920
You get permission?
Me neither.

346
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,239
It turns out parents
don't understand psychology.

347
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,998
Tell Sheen to meet us
at Retro Land in one hour.

348
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:31,757
We're sneakin' out.

349
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:35,076
Hold it right there!

350
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:38,235
- Flurp!
- Take that!

351
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:41,794
Jimmy's awfully quiet up there.
Do you think we were too tough?

352
00:26:41,874 --> 00:26:44,714
Oh, I don't think so, dear, no.

353
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:47,033
- Maybe I should check on him.
- Oh, now, now.

354
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:52,031
I'm sure he's just reflecting
on the error of his ways...

355
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,870
dealing with it in a mature,
responsible manner.

356
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:58,829
"Mom says you're grounded."
Take that!

357
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:03,227
It's working now.

358
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:06,747
Okay, Goddard.
you know what to do.

359
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:09,146
Good boy!

360
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:11,706
See ya later, Goddard!

361
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:17,544
Mmm! Jimmy's a big boy now.

362
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:22,382
- Don't you worry.
- Oh, I suppose you're right.

363
00:27:22,462 --> 00:27:26,461
yeah, sure. Look, I was a kid once.
I remember being grounded a week...

364
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:30,540
and not being allowed to go to
my best friend's bachelor party.

365
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,859
- What did you do?
- Actually, I snuck out.

366
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,298
you don't think that Jimmy--

367
00:27:38,377 --> 00:27:41,737
Oh, no, no. Besides,
how's he gonna sneak out?

368
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:45,615
It's not like he can just
walk right out the front door.

369
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:47,175
That's true.

370
00:27:54,693 --> 00:27:58,372
Retro Land, here I come.

371
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,529
Libby, you're breaking
my concentration.

372
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:13,927
Hey, I gotta choose a ring
that fits my personality.

373
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:16,726
yeah, here we go!
Here we go!

374
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:21,765
Tell me what it is you're
supposed to be doing again?

375
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:24,805
Tai Chi while drinking
Purple Flurp.

376
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:29,683
Tai Chi promotes wellness,
relaxes...

377
00:28:29,762 --> 00:28:32,882
and rejuvenates the body,
whereas Purple Flurp...

378
00:28:34,642 --> 00:28:37,521
being 98% sugar,
creates tension...

379
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:39,920
a temporary rush of energy
and mood swings.

380
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,599
I figure if I do them together...

381
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,798
I achieve perfect balance.

382
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:56,355
Wow. It's better than the poster!

383
00:28:56,435 --> 00:29:00,714
Gentlemen, this will be a night
we shan't easily forget.

384
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:03,713
I don't know what "shan't" means,
but let's go!

385
00:29:33,664 --> 00:29:37,943
Do you promise to use your powers
for good and not evil?

386
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:39,263
yes, Ultra Lord.

387
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:43,062
Now, counterpart,
take this UltraMask...

388
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:45,821
- I will! Give it to me!
- and lead the fight for justice!

389
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,460
Is this kid with anyone?

390
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:54,658
Go, Carl!

391
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:07,895
Wow! Now, that's what I call a ride!

392
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,654
Let's go!

393
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:23,170
This is way beyond awesome!

394
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,009
Just think: If you boneheaded dweebs
had listened to your parents...

395
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:31,168
you'd be home in bed,
instead of riding this monster.

396
00:30:35,526 --> 00:30:37,566
Oh, man, this is great!

397
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:45,084
- I tell you, he's fine.
- Just a quick peek, Hugh.

398
00:30:45,164 --> 00:30:47,683
There. Now, what'd I tell you?

399
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:52,842
- Jimmy, are you awake, dear?
- yes, Mother, I am awake.

400
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:57,080
Son, your mother and I just
wanted to say good night.

401
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,959
yes, and to tell you
that we love you.

402
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:09,477
Oh, honey,
I know you're upset.

403
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:14,435
We don't like to punish you.
you're such a special boy.

404
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:51,784
This says we should encourage Jimmy
without overindulging him.

405
00:31:51,865 --> 00:31:54,584
Okay. What does it say
about rockets?

406
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:57,063
Is there someone in the kitchen?

407
00:31:57,143 --> 00:32:00,182
Our kitchen?
I didn't hear anything.

408
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:07,100
Honey, did you leave
the green light on?

409
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:10,859
Jimmy?

410
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:19,497
you're not Jimmy!

411
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:25,375
Hugh, are you all right?

412
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:07,803
Was that so cool?

413
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:10,402
- That was great.
- Mind-bending!

414
00:33:10,482 --> 00:33:13,801
yeah! Hey, my pants
are almost dry.

415
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,439
Hey, Jimmy, I never thought
I'd say it, but here goes:

416
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,559
you know what?
That Nick is not such a bad guy.

417
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,678
Are you kidding? He's a genius!

418
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:25,918
- He's a genius!
- No offense, Jimmy.

419
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:27,437
None taken!

420
00:33:27,517 --> 00:33:31,196
Actually, his insights on dealing
with parents are quite refreshing.

421
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,874
Wouldn't it be great if our folks
all disappeared for a while?

422
00:33:34,955 --> 00:33:38,833
Oh, yeah.
Oh, hey, a shooting star!

423
00:33:38,873 --> 00:33:42,152
Cool! you get to make a wish. Lucky.

424
00:33:43,112 --> 00:33:45,072
What should I wish for?

425
00:33:45,112 --> 00:33:48,191
I know what I'd wish for.
I'd wish for no more parents.

426
00:33:48,271 --> 00:33:51,110
That way, we could do whatever
we wanted, whenever we wanted.

427
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,389
We'd be free!
We could have fun all the time!

428
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:57,388
yeah!

429
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:04,946
Lift off in five, four,
three, two--

430
00:34:05,906 --> 00:34:07,586
We have lift off!

431
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:11,305
Abort mission.
Abort mission!

432
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,623
Goddard, wake mode.

433
00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:19,222
All right, come on, boy.
Race ya to the kitchen!

434
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:23,940
Beat ya!

435
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:27,860
Hey, Mom, did you get
any more Purple Flurp?

436
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:29,859
Mom?

437
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:35,138
"Dear son/daughter--

438
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:38,577
We've gone to Florida
for an extended vacation.

439
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:40,776
Love, your parents."

440
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:43,655
yeah. My parents went
to Florida too.

441
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:45,695
That's weird.

442
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:47,694
From the look of it...

443
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:51,053
I'd say a lot of parents
are gone.

444
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:56,051
- Did they all go to Florida?
- Maybe they went to get juice.

445
00:34:56,132 --> 00:35:00,010
I don't digest pulp well.
It makes me bloaty.

446
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,729
Goddard, scan
for adult life-forms.

447
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:13,407
Just as I thought. There are
no adults anywhere within radar.

448
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,406
They're gone.
The whole city!

449
00:35:16,485 --> 00:35:18,645
No parents.

450
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:24,043
No parents!

451
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:32,601
Excuse me!

452
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,440
I'm letting out the cold!

453
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,599
I'm peeing in the shower!

454
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,958
Llama, llama, llama!

455
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:51,795
I'm walking up
the "down" escalator!

456
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:55,515
My clothes don't match. I'm out
in public and my clothes don't match

457
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:10,150
I'm still doin' it!
Go, go, go!

458
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:16,828
Welcome to the Candy Bar. Whoopee
cushion or non-whoopee cushion?

459
00:36:24,946 --> 00:36:27,745
What'll it be, boys?

460
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:31,944
We'll have what he's throwing.

461
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,504
Excellent choice!

462
00:36:38,741 --> 00:36:40,342
Hang on!

463
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,899
No skiing in the halls!

464
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,659
Don't make me get the protractor!

465
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,369
Morning, Goddard.
Oh, my head. What a night!

466
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:27,727
Oh, I'm stuffed now.
I-I couldn't have anoth--

467
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:30,047
Okay, one more.

468
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:32,726
I'm gonna have one more,
and then that'll be it.

469
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:39,684
What a battle. Are there
any survivors? Help me!

470
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:45,363
I remember my first time.

471
00:37:45,402 --> 00:37:47,882
Shake it off, Neutron!

472
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:52,560
I gotta get home. Mom and Dad
might be back by now.

473
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:54,320
Come on, Goddard.

474
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:05,637
We interrupt this program
to bring you this special report.

475
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:07,636
Hey, knock it off. Arnie!

476
00:38:08,356 --> 00:38:10,395
Trouble in paradise.

477
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:13,274
That's what some kids are saying
in the aftermath ofyesterday's...

478
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:15,714
"Mom and Dad are gone"
celebrations.

479
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:17,714
Here's Courtney Tyler.

480
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:22,192
What started as an awesome day
has become, like, a real bummer.

481
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:25,511
- Help us!
- I don 't know how to make lunch!

482
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:27,510
Somebody hold me!

483
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:31,109
I was playing
on the teeter-totter...

484
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:34,468
and the next thing I knew
I was on the ground...

485
00:38:34,548 --> 00:38:37,227
and my knee hurt!

486
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:42,626
Reports of tummy aches.
"owies" and constipation...

487
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:45,745
have reached epidemic numbers
over the past few hours...

488
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:48,344
with little indication
of slowing down.

489
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:54,183
And so we were gonna see who
could eat the most cotton candy...

490
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:56,942
and I won!

491
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:02,421
I want my mommy!

492
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,419
So, there you have it.

493
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:09,738
I want my mommy too!

494
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:17,416
Mom? Dad?

495
00:39:28,253 --> 00:39:31,931
What kind of parents take off
and leave their kid?

496
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:36,770
And they didn't even
say good-bye!

497
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:46,248
Son, your mother and I just
wanted to say good night.

498
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:49,127
Yes, and to tell you
that we love you.

499
00:39:50,886 --> 00:39:53,045
We only do what we do
because we love you.

500
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:57,285
Maybe we can all go to Retro Land
next weekend, the three of us.

501
00:39:57,365 --> 00:40:01,084
What about my fabulous dog.
Goddard?

502
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:04,442
Sure, your fabulous dog.
Goddard, too.

503
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:06,481
Well, good night, son.

504
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:10,641
Good night, Jimmy. Sweet dreams.
We'll see you in the morning.

505
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,598
Okay, so they said good night.

506
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,877
" In the morning"?
Hey, wait a minute!

507
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:24,357
Play back the last part again,
audio only.

508
00:40:24,436 --> 00:40:28,076
Good night, Jimmy. Sweet dreams.
We'll see you in the morning.

509
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:31,915
There! Why would she say that
if they weren't gonna be here?

510
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:36,033
Come on, Goddard.
We're goin' to the lab.

511
00:40:36,113 --> 00:40:38,073
It's just as I thought.

512
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:40,152
The serifs and kerning
on this note...

513
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,271
don't match
Mom and Dad's handwriting.

514
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:45,071
This note's a fake!

515
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,070
What is it, boy?

516
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,589
The long-range space scanner--
it detected something!

517
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:55,228
Filtering out background radiation,
and there it is!

518
00:40:55,307 --> 00:41:00,826
Jumpin' Jupiter! The Earth's
been visited by aliens!

519
00:41:01,786 --> 00:41:05,705
Okay, so me, you and a dog...

520
00:41:05,744 --> 00:41:10,263
are gonna battle an alien
civilization, right, by ourselves?

521
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:14,142
But he's a good dog.
Aren't you, boy?

522
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,622
The last time
we tried this, Jim...

523
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:18,981
we couldn't even break free
of the atmosphere.

524
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:22,540
I know. But I recalculated
the thrust-to-fuel ratio...

525
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,379
and I've adjusted the engine
accordingly.

526
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:28,978
- I can fix that.
- Neutron!

527
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:36,176
- What is it?
- An angry mob!

528
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:42,934
In times of crises, intellectuals
are always the first to go!

529
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:45,813
Well, they don't look angry.

530
00:41:45,893 --> 00:41:48,013
They look like
they're about to barf.

531
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:49,532
Let me go!

532
00:41:49,612 --> 00:41:52,691
you are messing with powers
beyond your mortal comprehension.

533
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:54,451
Okay, Neutron.

534
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:59,010
Ultra Freak here says you really know
what happened to all our parents.

535
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:00,969
Jimmy, how ya doin'?

536
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:03,608
I didn't say nothing about our
parents being abducted by aliens--

537
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,687
Where's my mom and dad?

538
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:08,727
Tell us where they are!

539
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,046
Goddard, star map 72, please.

540
00:42:13,725 --> 00:42:16,285
Right about there.

541
00:42:16,364 --> 00:42:19,803
Sensors picked up ion trails
indicating the departure route...

542
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:22,642
for whatever alien intelligence
has abducted our parents.

543
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:27,002
They lead to the Orion star system
three million light-years away.

544
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:29,120
So we'll need to leave by Friday.

545
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:32,080
Okay, that gives us about two days
to collect the plutonium...

546
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,879
design and test our fusion engines
and build our fleet of warships.

547
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:39,957
We'll also need to bring snacks.
Any questions?

548
00:42:44,157 --> 00:42:46,716
Are you sure about this, Neutron?

549
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:50,074
Well, the data seems
to support this hypothesis.

550
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:53,633
Never argue with the data.

551
00:42:54,714 --> 00:42:57,993
Okay, Neutron,
here's the lowdown.

552
00:42:58,032 --> 00:43:01,832
you get us to those
kidnapping alien scuzballs...

553
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:04,510
and I'll take it from there.

554
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:06,510
We're getting our parents back.

555
00:43:21,546 --> 00:43:25,504
Okay, Ben, that's good.
Let it down slow.

556
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:28,024
Two more turns, Emma,
not too tight.

557
00:43:30,703 --> 00:43:33,462
yup. Tape adhesion is
within operational limits.

558
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:36,461
Aw, what-- Cindy!

559
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:39,900
What did you do
to that intergalactic starship?

560
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,019
We thought that the deep recesses
of space could use a feminine touch.

561
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:48,218
- What do you think, Jimmy?
- yeah, it's okay, I guess.

562
00:43:48,298 --> 00:43:50,457
They kinda ruined it though.

563
00:43:50,537 --> 00:43:54,016
Hey, Jimmy! Do these fusion reactors
need fuel rods?

564
00:43:54,096 --> 00:43:58,095
Sheen, it's not rocket science.
you just have to--

565
00:43:58,175 --> 00:44:01,174
Actually, I guess
it is rocket science.

566
00:44:01,214 --> 00:44:03,853
- No fuel rods, Sheen!
- Okay.

567
00:44:06,413 --> 00:44:10,051
And for the final touch--

568
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:19,529
Good work, everybody.

569
00:44:19,608 --> 00:44:22,528
We're ready
for intergalactic travel.

570
00:44:22,608 --> 00:44:27,566
-Neutron, this is gonna work, right?
-yeah, what if it doesn't work?

571
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:29,686
It will work!

572
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:31,725
I'm 95% sure it will.

573
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:35,844
Ninety-five? yeah?
And the other five percent?

574
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:37,924
We blow up.

575
00:44:38,803 --> 00:44:40,363
But just a little.

576
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:43,322
Look, a 95 is still an "A."

577
00:44:43,402 --> 00:44:48,400
yeah, I can deal with that.
I never got a 95 in my life.

578
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,879
you heard the man. Stop suckin' your
thumbs, and let's light this candle!

579
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:02,757
Goddard,
initiate launch sequence.

580
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:05,036
Please make sure
your seat belts are fastened...

581
00:45:05,116 --> 00:45:08,994
and remember to keep hands and arms
inside the vehicles at all times.

582
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:17,033
yeah!

583
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:54,462
Come on, everybody.
Get in formation.

584
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:56,581
Carl, you're too low.

585
00:45:56,661 --> 00:46:01,699
Come on, you stupid butterfly!
Will you-- Whoa!

586
00:46:04,938 --> 00:46:07,458
Go, counterparts, go!

587
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:12,656
Hang on. We're passing
through the stratosphere.

588
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:15,176
Now the mesosphere.

589
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:17,615
Entering ionosphere.

590
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:21,774
Now I know why
they all end in "fear"!

591
00:46:21,854 --> 00:46:26,652
That's it, baby.
Engaging pulse rockets now!

592
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:32,451
Come on, come on.

593
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:03,322
Look, Goddard,
the wonders of the universe.

594
00:47:03,402 --> 00:47:08,760
We're witnessing celestial events
no person, or dog, has ever seen.

595
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,638
It's incredible!

596
00:47:20,717 --> 00:47:23,355
Beautiful, isn't it, Nick?

597
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:27,315
yeah, yeah.
Wake me when we get there.

598
00:47:28,074 --> 00:47:30,034
Hey, Jimmy!

599
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:33,433
Do you think we can
rotate ships after a while?

600
00:47:33,513 --> 00:47:35,792
Hey, we'll switch!

601
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:45,429
Hey, this astronaut food
isn't too bad.

602
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,269
That's toothpaste, Carl.

603
00:47:48,149 --> 00:47:50,628
Oh, Minty.

604
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,027
Hey, what's happening?

605
00:47:54,107 --> 00:47:57,026
Meteor shower!
Evasive action!

606
00:48:07,263 --> 00:48:11,062
I do so relish
these times of peril.

607
00:48:31,337 --> 00:48:33,536
- That was close.
- Look out!

608
00:48:40,973 --> 00:48:43,253
We gotta find shelter!

609
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:46,212
Asteroid bearing two-thirty-six
mark seven degrees.

610
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:47,731
Come on!

611
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:16,643
So these three filmmakers find
all these sticks in the trees...

612
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:18,722
shaped like stick people...

613
00:49:18,803 --> 00:49:21,322
and the girl film maker
starts cryin'...

614
00:49:21,402 --> 00:49:26,640
and her nose starts dripping, and
they don't have any tissue at all.

615
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,320
None?

616
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,119
None.

617
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:33,438
So then they start to hear...

618
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:37,917
really scary noises and voices
coming from outside.

619
00:49:37,997 --> 00:49:40,956
So they leave the tent.

620
00:49:41,036 --> 00:49:43,196
Don't leave the tent!
Don't leave the tent!

621
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:47,714
Oh, yeah, Carl, they leave the tent,
and they follow the voices...

622
00:49:47,794 --> 00:49:51,033
when from out of the darkness
comes the--

623
00:49:53,873 --> 00:49:56,991
That was so choice!
you should have seen your faces.

624
00:49:58,471 --> 00:50:01,590
Did they really
leave the tent, Nick?

625
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:05,829
There's a red giant!
And that's a white dwarf!

626
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:08,029
you can relate, huh, Neutron?

627
00:50:11,267 --> 00:50:13,386
Hey, Jimmy,
what's the matter?

628
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:18,306
In case you haven't noticed, I'm not
exactly the tallest guy around.

629
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:22,904
Shorty, squirt, small stuff,
shrimp-- gets to you after a while.

630
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:25,183
And next year,
there'll be dances.

631
00:50:25,263 --> 00:50:29,422
Who wants to dance with a guy who looks
like he should still be in Gymboree?

632
00:50:29,502 --> 00:50:31,862
I didn't think
we liked girls yet.

633
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:35,981
Oh, we don't.
No, not yet.

634
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,899
No. However, one day, Carl...

635
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,818
an influx of hormones
that we can't control...

636
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:44,018
will overpower
our better judgment...

637
00:50:44,097 --> 00:50:47,697
and drive us to pursue
the female species against our will.

638
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:52,136
Stop talking like that, Jimmy!
you're gonna give me nightmares.

639
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:57,374
Listen, I wouldn't worry. Puberty
is light-years away for you and me.

640
00:51:01,173 --> 00:51:06,012
you know, we should've
never wished on that star and...

641
00:51:06,091 --> 00:51:09,291
I, I miss my folks.

642
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:13,250
My mom used to tuck me
in bed every night...

643
00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:16,289
before she was abducted by aliens.

644
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:21,487
Before my dad
was abducted by aliens...

645
00:51:21,567 --> 00:51:23,967
he would always read me to sleep.

646
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:28,365
And before my mom
was "inducted" by aliens...

647
00:51:28,445 --> 00:51:32,764
she would rub my tummy,
and she'd sing--

648
00:51:36,202 --> 00:51:38,523
- What?
- Nothing!

649
00:51:38,602 --> 00:51:42,601
Come on, you guys.
We gotta keep our heads.

650
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:45,040
We'll find 'em.

651
00:52:18,911 --> 00:52:21,270
What is it, boy?

652
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:27,108
Sensor sweeps reveal many advanced
cities and ion energy signatures.

653
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:28,628
That's it!

654
00:52:28,668 --> 00:52:31,466
We found it!
I repeat, we found it!

655
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:36,626
Nick, we'll contact you
as soon as we find the parents...

656
00:52:36,705 --> 00:52:38,825
so you can kick
some alien buttocks!

657
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,345
Piece of cake.

658
00:52:40,384 --> 00:52:43,784
Okay, scouting party,
follow me!

659
00:52:43,863 --> 00:52:46,383
I'll be back, Nick!

660
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,060
Whoa, what is that?

661
00:53:21,012 --> 00:53:24,732
They've evolved beyond the need
for mere conventional bodies.

662
00:53:24,811 --> 00:53:28,850
They must be an advanced species
millions of years ahead of us.

663
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:34,249
Wow! When I sneeze, it looks like
an advanced species too.

664
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,846
Okay, they're this way.

665
00:53:45,326 --> 00:53:47,525
Right this way, sire.

666
00:53:49,205 --> 00:53:52,683
Ooblar, these humans look
so scrawny.

667
00:53:52,764 --> 00:53:55,923
Hardly very appetizing.
Are you sure they're yummy?

668
00:53:55,962 --> 00:54:00,801
I assure you, my slimy sovereign,
Poultra will be quite pleased.

669
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:04,520
Humans are mostly water,
with a crunchy bony center.

670
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,720
Think nuts and chews.

671
00:54:06,799 --> 00:54:09,118
- There they are.
- What are they doing?

672
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:11,518
What are those goofy-looking
things on their heads?

673
00:54:11,598 --> 00:54:15,117
It looks like some kind
of mind-control device.

674
00:54:15,197 --> 00:54:19,756
Mom, Dad. Dad, it's me, Jimmy.
Over here.

675
00:54:19,836 --> 00:54:22,835
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jimmys,
James, James, Jim.

676
00:54:22,915 --> 00:54:26,754
Big fiery flying Jimmy.
Hi, Jimmy.

677
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:29,913
Some dream, huh?
Attack of the Big Egg People.

678
00:54:29,993 --> 00:54:32,392
- I think I've seen this one before.
- No, Dad.

679
00:54:32,432 --> 00:54:35,951
you're wearing a mind-control
device. Take yours off. Hurry!

680
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,789
- Dad?
- Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

681
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,869
- Dad, no, no! No!
- Intruder alert!

682
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:47,627
your dad's like
a mind-controlled duck man.

683
00:54:47,667 --> 00:54:49,707
Let's get outta here!

684
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:53,066
Come back!
Join us, Jimmy!

685
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,983
Well, well!

686
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:07,222
If it isn't the littlest
rescue party. How cute.

687
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:09,461
Hello, itty-bitty humans.

688
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:12,340
you let us go,
you big ball of phlegm!

689
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:15,980
That's no way to talk to the king!
He is the royal phlegm.

690
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:18,299
- Ooblar.
- Sorry, sire.

691
00:55:18,379 --> 00:55:22,658
It's only fair to warn you that if
you don't release us in 24 hours...

692
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:25,216
an army of highly-trained
combat specialists...

693
00:55:25,297 --> 00:55:28,136
is poised to destroy
your entire planet.

694
00:55:28,215 --> 00:55:30,096
- Oh, really?
- Really.

695
00:55:30,135 --> 00:55:34,734
Oh, my! Our entire planet!
Whatever shall we do?

696
00:55:34,814 --> 00:55:36,414
Do you mean...

697
00:55:36,493 --> 00:55:39,732
this army of highly-trained
combat specialists?

698
00:55:39,813 --> 00:55:41,892
Hey, Nick!

699
00:55:44,811 --> 00:55:47,690
Get your grubs off me, egghead!

700
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:52,009
Don't look so surprised.
We're an advanced alien race.

701
00:55:52,089 --> 00:55:56,607
- What did you expect?
- What do you want with our parents?

702
00:55:56,688 --> 00:56:00,606
It's not what I want.
It's what Poultra wants.

703
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:03,325
- Who's Poultra?
- Poultra is our god...

704
00:56:03,406 --> 00:56:06,525
the mightiest, most
ferocious creature in all--

705
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:10,084
Oh, I get tired of answering this.
Roll tape.

706
00:56:12,563 --> 00:56:17,642
Hello and welcome to our special
edition of Poultra: God of Wrath.

707
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:20,281
Brought to you by Goom--

708
00:56:20,361 --> 00:56:22,641
Commercials! I hate them.

709
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,280
Welcome back.

710
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,158
If you're watching this, chances are
your friends and or relatives...

711
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:31,678
are about to be sacrificed
to the mighty Poultra.

712
00:56:31,717 --> 00:56:33,677
Which is a great honor indeed.

713
00:56:33,717 --> 00:56:35,357
And very painful.

714
00:56:38,155 --> 00:56:42,274
And this year's human sacrifices
feature something very special--

715
00:56:42,355 --> 00:56:44,314
actual humans!

716
00:56:44,354 --> 00:56:47,673
And it's all thanks
to Jimmy Neutron.

717
00:56:47,753 --> 00:56:50,112
Greetings from planet Earth!

718
00:56:50,193 --> 00:56:51,871
I'm Jimmy Neutron.
and you're an alien life-form.

719
00:56:51,871 --> 00:56:54,871
I'm Jimmy Neutron.
and you're an alien life-form.

720
00:56:54,951 --> 00:56:57,150
Without the coordinates
you gave us...

721
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,109
we never would have found
your puny little planet.

722
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:04,868
For such a tiny earthling, you've
been a very big help, Jimmy Neutron.

723
00:57:04,948 --> 00:57:08,187
Guards, throw these minuscule vermin
into the dungeon...

724
00:57:08,267 --> 00:57:10,187
until they're of worthier size.

725
00:57:10,266 --> 00:57:13,865
And oh, give Mr. Neutron
the presidential suite.

726
00:57:13,945 --> 00:57:15,864
What?

727
00:57:20,823 --> 00:57:25,142
Ohh! Isn't this
a funny-wunny little toy!

728
00:57:27,022 --> 00:57:29,701
Get it off me!

729
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:33,380
Take this infernal thing to the lab
and have it torn apart!

730
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,059
Oh, yes,
great saliva-armed one.

731
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:39,098
Hold it! Move along.

732
00:57:39,138 --> 00:57:41,458
- Goddard!
- Move!

733
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:10,609
So, it was Neutron all along.

734
00:58:10,689 --> 00:58:12,609
I mean, he got us into this.

735
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:16,687
Jimmy, didn't your parents ever
tell you not to talk to strangers?

736
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:18,727
That's rule number one.

737
00:58:18,806 --> 00:58:21,726
Oh, come on, you guys!
Give him a break.

738
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:23,925
Jimmy didn't mean
to ruin our lives...

739
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:27,444
and get our parents eaten
by a giant space monster!

740
00:58:27,524 --> 00:58:32,483
She's right. We must ask ourselves,
"What would Ultra Lord do?'

741
00:58:32,563 --> 00:58:34,522
Let's think about that, Sheen.

742
00:58:34,602 --> 00:58:37,481
Maybe sit on a shelf,
because he's a doll!

743
00:58:37,562 --> 00:58:40,281
He's not a doll! He's an action
figure! There's a difference.

744
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,479
Come on, Nick, let Sheen talk.
Maybe he's onto something.

745
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,679
What would Ultra Lord do, Sheen?

746
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:48,838
Well, in episode 224...

747
00:58:48,918 --> 00:58:52,157
he fried the Zeebot's brain with
his heat-seeking infra-thought.

748
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,877
It was cool!

749
00:58:55,876 --> 00:58:58,116
Well, I'm convinced, folks.

750
00:58:58,195 --> 00:59:01,194
That's pretty much the
stupidest thing I've ever heard!

751
00:59:01,234 --> 00:59:03,834
No, this is the stupidest thing
you've ever heard!

752
00:59:05,394 --> 00:59:09,072
- Oh, you're such a baby!
- Why don't you leave me alone?

753
00:59:09,152 --> 00:59:11,552
you're picking on me
because you're insecure!

754
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:15,070
Jimmy, you there?

755
00:59:15,111 --> 00:59:19,950
Look, don't listen to them.
They're just scared.

756
00:59:20,029 --> 00:59:22,028
Are you okay?

757
00:59:22,109 --> 00:59:24,907
yeah, I'm fine.

758
00:59:24,988 --> 00:59:28,667
Don't be so hard on yourself.
We'll get out of this.

759
00:59:30,227 --> 00:59:33,625
Okay, so you made a mistake.

760
00:59:33,705 --> 00:59:36,464
Beating yourself up
isn't gonna fix anything.

761
00:59:36,544 --> 00:59:41,983
you know, I was the smartest kid
in school until you came along.

762
00:59:42,062 --> 00:59:45,181
And I admit you know more
about some things than I do.

763
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:48,781
But I know one thing
that you don't seem to get...

764
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:52,660
and that's that we're never
getting outta here without you.

765
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:55,699
So why don't you buck up, mister...

766
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:58,458
and put that big brain of yours
back to work?

767
00:59:58,538 --> 01:00:00,737
Nick can handle
the fighting stuff...

768
01:00:00,817 --> 01:00:03,097
but first we have
to get out of this cell.

769
01:00:05,296 --> 01:00:07,056
Cindy?

770
01:00:07,135 --> 01:00:09,734
Why are you being so nice to me?

771
01:00:09,775 --> 01:00:13,853
'Cause there's a bunch of kids
in here that need you...

772
01:00:13,934 --> 01:00:15,853
and I do too.

773
01:00:22,691 --> 01:00:26,490
I am never complaining
about my parents again.

774
01:00:28,649 --> 01:00:30,888
We didn't even get
our one phone call.

775
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,408
That's it!

776
01:00:33,488 --> 01:00:35,407
Libby, let me see your cell phone.

777
01:00:35,488 --> 01:00:37,886
Okay, but I don't think
my service plan...

778
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:40,126
covers anything
outside our solar system.

779
01:00:40,206 --> 01:00:44,045
- Who're you calling?
- A friend of mine.

780
01:00:47,204 --> 01:00:49,484
All right, little Earth doggy.

781
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:54,602
Ooblar is going to take you apart
into tiny little pieces.

782
01:00:54,682 --> 01:00:56,161
All right?

783
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,519
Hey! Give me that!

784
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:07,078
Fine! We'll use this one then.

785
01:01:07,118 --> 01:01:09,318
No-no-no-no!

786
01:01:10,557 --> 01:01:13,516
Would you stop that!
Those are mine!

787
01:01:22,754 --> 01:01:26,593
That's not funny. Stop it!
And give me my thing!

788
01:01:26,672 --> 01:01:28,512
Come on, boy, pick up.

789
01:01:30,551 --> 01:01:33,911
Oh, good! Good.
Perhaps we'll get somewhere.

790
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:36,269
Goddard, you're okay.

791
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:41,628
I miss you too, boy.
Listen, what's your situation?

792
01:01:45,347 --> 01:01:47,707
Evil scientist, huh?

793
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:50,825
Okay, I've got an idea.
Put me on speaker, Goddard.

794
01:01:52,665 --> 01:01:54,104
Danger! Danger!

795
01:01:54,185 --> 01:01:57,864
You have initiated
self-destruct sequence alpha.

796
01:01:57,943 --> 01:02:01,102
That's my bad.
Back in you go.

797
01:02:01,183 --> 01:02:04,381
Self-destruct sequence
is now engaged.

798
01:02:04,422 --> 01:02:07,141
No-no-no! I put it back in.
you understand me?

799
01:02:07,221 --> 01:02:11,420
This unit will yield a 50-megaton
nuclear blast in ten seconds.

800
01:02:11,499 --> 01:02:13,219
That's not good!

801
01:02:13,259 --> 01:02:18,097
Please clear a 30-square mile area.
Thank you. And have a nice day.

802
01:02:18,178 --> 01:02:19,777
Ten, nine--

803
01:02:19,857 --> 01:02:23,296
No! Bad dog! Mother!

804
01:02:23,336 --> 01:02:25,935
Is he gone, boy?

805
01:02:26,016 --> 01:02:29,614
Great! Lock on to this signal
and get here as fast as you can.

806
01:02:37,732 --> 01:02:40,012
Halt!
Who goes there?

807
01:02:40,091 --> 01:02:41,491
Oh, the guard!

808
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:43,851
By order of the
most esteemed King Goobot...

809
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:47,969
it is my privilege and honor
to mercilessly exterminate you.

810
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:50,848
Think, think.
Goddard, play dead.

811
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:04,484
Good boy, Goddard, good boy!

812
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:06,844
Guess I'll make that bug a feature.

813
01:03:06,923 --> 01:03:09,362
- Good dog, Goddard!
- Way to go!

814
01:03:09,403 --> 01:03:12,402
- Come on! Let's get the others!
- Nice work, Jimmy.

815
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:19,240
Hey, Cindy, thanks.

816
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,520
If you ever tell anyone
I was nice to you...

817
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,559
you'll wind up
looking like that guy.

818
01:03:25,878 --> 01:03:29,917
Let's go, Neutron!
It's egg-scrambling time.

819
01:03:29,997 --> 01:03:32,836
- Wait for me, Nick!
- Come back!

820
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:36,115
Please?

821
01:03:47,672 --> 01:03:49,991
Bring out the humans!

822
01:04:04,187 --> 01:04:05,667
It's show time.

823
01:04:05,746 --> 01:04:07,226
Everybody out.

824
01:04:22,502 --> 01:04:23,782
Kick it!

825
01:04:44,575 --> 01:04:49,254
- Look, you guys, a football game!
- I don't think so, Carl.

826
01:04:49,334 --> 01:04:52,133
Goddard, binoscope mode!

827
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,890
What a lame halftime show.

828
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:07,568
They're making our parents
dance so lame.

829
01:05:07,649 --> 01:05:10,568
No, my dad really dances like that.

830
01:05:14,087 --> 01:05:16,006
The festival is starting.

831
01:05:16,086 --> 01:05:18,326
Our parents-- they'll be eaten!

832
01:05:18,405 --> 01:05:22,765
Nobody eats my parents
unless I say so! Come on!

833
01:05:24,563 --> 01:05:27,803
Begin the incubation!

834
01:05:33,121 --> 01:05:36,441
C'mon, Nick.
Show them what you're made of!

835
01:05:36,481 --> 01:05:38,440
Halt!

836
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,280
Hey, cool spear.

837
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,078
Oh, you really think so?
I guess so, because--

838
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:46,478
Mind if I try?

839
01:05:47,557 --> 01:05:49,516
No-no-no!

840
01:05:49,556 --> 01:05:51,596
My hero!

841
01:05:53,156 --> 01:05:54,835
Come on, everyone!

842
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:17,709
My hero?

843
01:06:17,749 --> 01:06:20,107
Okay, we need another plan.

844
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:22,507
Probably a Nick-less one.

845
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:33,904
Poultra! Poultra!

846
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:37,783
Citizens ofyokus...

847
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:40,542
I, King Goobot V...

848
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:43,741
give you sacrifice!

849
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:54,138
That's a big chicken.

850
01:07:02,976 --> 01:07:05,494
What do we do now?

851
01:07:19,371 --> 01:07:20,890
Think! Think!

852
01:07:28,488 --> 01:07:30,167
Brain Blast!

853
01:07:30,248 --> 01:07:33,287
Okay, everybody, listen up.
We don't have much time.

854
01:07:33,367 --> 01:07:35,647
I've got to make it
to that control tower.

855
01:07:35,726 --> 01:07:39,685
Cindy, Libby, keep the guards busy
until Sheen arrives with the ship.

856
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:43,124
Okay, I heard the ship part,
but was that, "Sheen, get the ship"?

857
01:07:43,204 --> 01:07:45,123
- yeah.
- Ohh! Oh.

858
01:07:45,203 --> 01:07:48,762
There's a transport ship
big enough to carry us out of here.

859
01:07:48,842 --> 01:07:50,761
I need you to get it here
as fast as you can.

860
01:07:50,842 --> 01:07:54,641
But I don't have a driver's license.
I have no hand-eye coordination.

861
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,599
Ask yourself,
what would Ultra Lord do?

862
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,038
I accept this responsibility...

863
01:08:02,118 --> 01:08:05,597
understanding the consequences
you've bestowed against me.

864
01:08:05,678 --> 01:08:10,756
Poultra, din-dins.
yummy, yummy, foodie-woodie.

865
01:08:13,515 --> 01:08:17,034
This is it, people. These
crummy aliens stole our parents.

866
01:08:17,114 --> 01:08:19,033
It's time to show them
what we're made of.

867
01:08:19,114 --> 01:08:23,193
We're tough, we're mean! Darn it,
we're carbon-based life-forms!

868
01:08:23,272 --> 01:08:25,352
Now, who's gonna kick buttocks?

869
01:08:25,431 --> 01:08:27,431
The "carbonated" life-forms!

870
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:37,668
What? What? What is this?
Stop those kids!

871
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:39,028
After 'em!

872
01:08:42,947 --> 01:08:44,866
Cindy, Purple Flurp!

873
01:08:46,305 --> 01:08:48,545
Dragon whips her tail.

874
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:01,062
Let's dance!

875
01:09:08,659 --> 01:09:10,099
yeah, Jimmy!

876
01:09:11,138 --> 01:09:13,338
Come on, boy!

877
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:15,217
Jimmy!

878
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:16,897
Carl, show-and-tell!

879
01:09:18,096 --> 01:09:20,016
Come here, you!

880
01:09:21,216 --> 01:09:22,495
I can't see!

881
01:09:25,615 --> 01:09:28,734
you want some?
you want a piece of me?

882
01:09:30,213 --> 01:09:32,173
I didn't think so!

883
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:43,850
Munchy, crunchy time.
There you go!

884
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,848
- Fetch, boy!
- Hey, hey, gimme that!

885
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:51,727
- Come back here!
- Everybody up.

886
01:10:01,204 --> 01:10:04,203
Hey, nice party!
Gotta blast!

887
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:06,403
Neutron!

888
01:10:06,483 --> 01:10:08,442
Okay, let's move out.

889
01:10:11,761 --> 01:10:15,200
Guards, vaporize the Earth brats!

890
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:22,798
Hurry! Head to the exit!

891
01:10:24,278 --> 01:10:27,196
- Hey, where's Sheen?
- I don't know.

892
01:10:27,277 --> 01:10:28,916
Stop them!

893
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:44,432
All right, Sheen!

894
01:10:46,631 --> 01:10:50,310
your ship awaits, Captain Jimmy!

895
01:11:02,947 --> 01:11:04,905
Ooblar, protect--

896
01:11:09,424 --> 01:11:11,623
Oh, pooh!

897
01:11:11,704 --> 01:11:13,583
Everybody to the ship!

898
01:11:15,863 --> 01:11:18,982
Poultra, quickly!
your dinner's getting away!

899
01:11:19,022 --> 01:11:21,021
Okay, let's get outta here.

900
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:22,981
Come on!

901
01:11:28,819 --> 01:11:32,298
We gotta do this quick!
Launch positions.

902
01:11:32,378 --> 01:11:34,897
Core temperature optimal.
Engaging primary plasma coils.

903
01:11:34,977 --> 01:11:37,816
- Jim, I think we better leave now.
- Beginning countdown. Ten. Nine.

904
01:11:37,896 --> 01:11:40,136
Eight--

905
01:11:40,216 --> 01:11:41,695
One!

906
01:11:53,171 --> 01:11:54,611
To the ships!

907
01:11:54,652 --> 01:11:57,131
And could someone bring me a bucket?

908
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,690
We made it!

909
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:04,249
Jimmy, here they come!

910
01:12:08,127 --> 01:12:12,566
Time to discipline
the naughty children. Open fire!

911
01:12:24,203 --> 01:12:27,002
Okay, who wants fried chicken?

912
01:12:50,355 --> 01:12:53,875
So, Neutron,
now it's just you and I.

913
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:55,833
All weapons on-line!

914
01:12:55,914 --> 01:13:00,952
Ultra Lord is not afraid of chickens
He is not afraid

915
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,910
Okay, he may be a little bit
afraid of chickens

916
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,229
This thing's too slow.
I can't out run 'em!

917
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:12,708
- Incoming message.
- On screen.

918
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:16,148
You see, Jimmy, you can't win.

919
01:13:16,228 --> 01:13:19,107
All of your friends
and family would be safe at home...

920
01:13:19,147 --> 01:13:22,466
if it wasn't for one
little problem-- you.

921
01:13:22,546 --> 01:13:25,545
- Little?
- Now you all must die!

922
01:13:26,905 --> 01:13:30,943
Little, huh?
I'll show you little.

923
01:13:31,024 --> 01:13:32,983
Cindy, take over.
C'mon, boy.

924
01:13:33,023 --> 01:13:37,622
What are you doing?
Is this one of those macho things?

925
01:13:37,702 --> 01:13:42,460
We haven't field tested this feature
yet, but we have no choice, buddy.

926
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,180
Goddard, Fly Cycle!

927
01:13:54,497 --> 01:13:58,856
Would you look at this? I do believe
he's going to ram us, Ooblar.

928
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:02,654
Remind me to clean
the windshield later.

929
01:14:06,014 --> 01:14:09,013
you steal my parents,
you threaten my dog.

930
01:14:09,092 --> 01:14:11,012
Itsy-bitsy Jimmy Neutron!

931
01:14:11,092 --> 01:14:13,931
He does look a bit small and silly,
doesn't he?

932
01:14:14,011 --> 01:14:17,370
you attack my friends,
and you made fun of my size!

933
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:19,929
- Tiny, tiny.
- So, so tiny!

934
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:24,888
Well, I may be small,
but I've got a big brain!

935
01:14:30,687 --> 01:14:32,526
- No!
- Not tiny!

936
01:14:34,525 --> 01:14:38,804
Can't we call this whole thing a
mistake and go back to your plan...

937
01:14:38,884 --> 01:14:42,163
rendezvous for "universal
brotherhood" and what not?

938
01:14:51,281 --> 01:14:54,440
you've not seen the last of us...

939
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,999
Jimmy Neutron!

940
01:14:59,558 --> 01:15:01,958
you look marvelous
sunny-side up, sire.

941
01:15:02,037 --> 01:15:03,877
That's no yolk.

942
01:15:05,957 --> 01:15:08,396
All right, Jimmy!

943
01:15:08,475 --> 01:15:11,275
Orbiting around
Jimmy's big head.

944
01:15:11,354 --> 01:15:13,714
Estimated time to ear,
seven minutes.

945
01:15:19,312 --> 01:15:23,711
So I guess I can't
call you short anymore.

946
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:28,310
Don't worry. I'm sure there are
other insults you can come up with.

947
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:38,107
Let me tell you,
as soon as we get home...

948
01:15:38,186 --> 01:15:40,586
we're going out dancing!

949
01:15:44,346 --> 01:15:46,105
Ultra Dad!

950
01:15:46,144 --> 01:15:48,704
Ultra Son!

951
01:15:49,743 --> 01:15:51,623
Dad? Daddy!

952
01:15:51,703 --> 01:15:53,982
Hey, Neutron...

953
01:15:54,022 --> 01:15:55,542
nice job.

954
01:15:56,622 --> 01:15:58,101
Thanks.

955
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:02,020
I've got that for you, dear.

956
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:08,378
Mom, Dad...

957
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:12,417
I should've listened to you when
you said don't talk to strangers.

958
01:16:12,497 --> 01:16:17,015
See, I guess I thought I was smart
enough to do everything on my own...

959
01:16:17,096 --> 01:16:19,095
that I didn't need you.

960
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:21,694
But I was wrong.

961
01:16:21,775 --> 01:16:23,853
I love you guys.

962
01:16:23,934 --> 01:16:26,373
We love you too, Jimmy.

963
01:16:26,452 --> 01:16:29,612
Having a genius for a son
may not always be easy...

964
01:16:29,692 --> 01:16:31,971
but it's always interesting.

965
01:16:32,052 --> 01:16:34,410
you make us so proud.

966
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:36,051
you sure do.

967
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:39,369
Not every family gets to ride
in an alien spaceship...

968
01:16:39,449 --> 01:16:43,248
hurtling at warp speeds,
millions of miles from home.

969
01:16:43,328 --> 01:16:45,287
We thank you for that.

970
01:16:45,328 --> 01:16:48,286
Now you gotta admit,
that is pretty neat.

971
01:16:54,085 --> 01:16:54,525
There you are, gentlemen.

972
01:16:54,525 --> 01:16:56,364
There you are, gentlemen.

973
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,884
Freeze!

974
01:16:57,964 --> 01:17:01,723
- It's okay, it's just breakfast.
- I knew that.

975
01:17:01,803 --> 01:17:05,202
I don't remember buying
this brand of soda.

976
01:17:05,281 --> 01:17:06,602
No, Mom--

977
01:17:06,641 --> 01:17:09,240
Jimmy, it's just soda.

978
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:11,240
Mom, no!

979
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,558
Goodness! Excuse me!

980
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:19,438
Boy, it's a scorcher out there!

981
01:17:19,478 --> 01:17:20,957
Thanks, honey.

982
01:17:23,116 --> 01:17:25,956
At least it's coming out
of the attic, not the basement!

983
01:17:36,993 --> 01:17:41,191
James Isaac Neutron--

984
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:49,172
Onward, Mr. Wiggles.
We reach the cafeteria by dawn!
