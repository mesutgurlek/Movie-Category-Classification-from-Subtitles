One: never underestimate your opponent.

Expect the unexpected.

238
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,533
Two: take it outside.

239

Never start anything inside the bar
unIess it's absoIuteIy necessary.

you a cocksucker, I want you to be nice.

Ask him to waIk, be nice.

245

If he won't waIk, waIk him. But be nice.

Oh, I... It wasn't too hard.
I mean... You know what I... mean.

What did you do there Iast night?

- What do you mean?
- WeII, you fired the bartender, Pat.

321
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:45,690
- He was skimming.
- You shouId not have done that, DaIton.

322
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,697
- Yeah? Why's that?
- You just shouIdn't have, that's aII.

925
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:01,044
Now, you're not mad at me
about that, are you?

926
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,964
HeII, you took Jimmy.

927
01:45:04,089 --> 01:45:06,132
He was in better shape.

928
01:45:10,345 --> 01:45:12,389
HeII, you took aII my boys.

929
01:45:28,363 --> 01:45:30,407
Now, come on out, DaIton.

930
01:45:32,742 --> 01:45:35,120
This town is big enough for both of us.

931
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:38,165
Let's taIk about this.

932
01:46:39,184 --> 01:46:40,435
Argh!

933
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:50,654
I thought it wouId be fun
to fight you, DaIton. I reaIIy did.

934
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:54,783
But now I just don't have the time.

936
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:31,778
No!

937
01:47:33,363 --> 01:47:34,656
It's over!

938
01:47:49,754 --> 01:47:51,381
Argh!

939
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:56,052
This is "our" town, and don't "you" forget it.

942
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:37,719
- Brad, where are you?
- They're in here, Sheriff.

943
01:48:46,144 --> 01:48:50,315
AII right. Who's gonna teII me
what the heII happened here?

944
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:52,484
I didn't see nothing.

945
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:57,364
- You see anything, Pete?
- No, I didn't see anything.

946
01:48:58,281 --> 01:49:00,408
You see anything, Red?

947
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:02,661
I didn't see nothing. Not a thing.

948
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:05,956
You see anything, Tinker?

949
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,133
A poIar bear feII on me.
