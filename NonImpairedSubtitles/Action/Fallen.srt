1
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:40,819
<i>I want to tell you</i>
<i>about the time I almost died.</i>

2
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,303
<i>I never thought it would happen to me.</i>

3
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:02,844
<i>Not at this age.</i>

4
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,402
<i>Beaten...</i>

5
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,205
<i>... outsmarted.</i>

6
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,816
<i>How did I get into this fix?</i>
<i>How did it all begin?</i>

7
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,184
<i>If I go back to the beginning</i>
<i>that'll take forever.</i>

8
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:15,850
<i>So let's start more recently.</i>

9
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,990
<i>Somewhere.</i>

10
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:19,656
<i>Anywhere.</i>

11
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,395
<i>Reese.</i>

12
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,693
I thought the governor
didn't approve of this.

13
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:01,629
The more they don't approve,
the more they want to watch.

14
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:05,137
So what is this, six notches on your belt?

15
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,467
Eight.

16
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,141
Congratulations.

17
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:10,301
Fuck you.

18
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,380
Ask me more nicely, huh?

19
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,811
John Hobbes.

20
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:16,641
Wanted in dance hall.

21
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,261
Edgar Reese.

22
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,494
Well, well, well.

23
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,169
Look who's here.

24
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,937
It's the brilliant detective
who sealed my brutish fate.

25
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,238
That's right.

26
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,607
So what is this?
They making you famous now?

27
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:50,517
Big time. They're gonna put me
in the movies. Documentary.

28
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:54,123
Courtesy of the ACLU.
They'll shoot me getting smoked.

29
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,984
Who knows?
Maybe it'll be a big video rental.

30
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:01,792
All these society ladies showing it
to their dinner guests:

31
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:04,766
"You see that there?
That's a urine stain, ladies."

32
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,268
"Oh, my, it's not urine."

33
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:09,963
It's good to see you, Hobbes.

34
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,200
It's good to be seen by you, Reese.

35
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:16,371
You're...

36
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:18,971
...my best pal.

37
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:35,121
You're still a good fella.

38
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:58,918
Open the gate.

39
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:04,249
You remind me of somebody, Hobbes.

40
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,653
Indeed you do.

41
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,291
Indeed you do.

42
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:10,732
Do you like riddles?

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,126
No, I don't.

44
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:15,264
Here's a beaut.

45
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:17,603
Why is there...

46
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,007
...a space between Lyons and Spakowsky?

47
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:22,537
What?

48
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,442
Come on. You should know this one, pal.
You should know this one.

49
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:29,081
Open your eyes. Look around sometime.

50
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,720
Open the gate.

51
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,752
Remember this, Hobbes.

52
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,857
A day...

53
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,796
...a week, a month.

54
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,970
What are you, a Nazi now?

55
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:52,566
It's Dutch.

56
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,703
What goes around...

57
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,304
...really goes around.

58
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:00,506
You have a safe trip.

59
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:02,576
I'll be looking for ya.

60
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:12,794
What goes around really goes around.

61
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,559
Howdy, folks.

62
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,364
Ladies, gents...

63
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,496
...cocksuckers, pederasts...

64
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,773
...I hope you all enjoy the show. Yes, I do.

65
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,912
I'll give you a blowjob
if you get me out of this baby.

66
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:56,430
"Time

67
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:00,062
"Is on my side

68
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,667
"Yes, it is

69
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,432
"Time

70
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:06,808
"Is on my side

71
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:09,003
"Yes, it is

72
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,480
"Now you always say

73
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,009
"That you want to be free

74
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:17,216
"But I'll come running back

75
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,815
"I'll come running back to you"

76
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:25,690
Baby, come on, go ahead...

77
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:27,693
...light up my life!

78
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,985
<i>Something is always happening.</i>

79
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:04,599
<i>But when it happens,</i>
<i>people don't always see it...</i>

80
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,727
<i>... or understand it...</i>

81
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:10,896
<i>... or accept it.</i>

82
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,403
<i>The criminals don't accept consequences.</i>

83
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:28,145
<i>They kill. It's not their fault.</i>
<i>This is the consequence of what I do.</i>

84
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:30,583
- Look who made it.
- Mr. Consequence, how'd it go?

85
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,744
- He died.
- Told you.

86
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,183
Get one more.

87
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:35,854
Nice to see you.

88
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,584
How you doing, Gracie?

89
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,758
- Don't tempt me with that.
- Sorry.

90
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,023
What's your poison? We got some Becks.

91
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,590
We got some Guinness.
We got some Bass.

92
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,864
- Budweiser's good for me.
- Budweiser?

93
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:49,927
- Yeah.
- Good.

94
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,940
No, we're going imported here.

95
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,839
- You can't afford it. I'll buy.
- I can afford it. Budweiser.

96
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:59,041
At least have a Bud Ice
or a Bud Dry or something.

97
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,506
It is just a Bud, okay?

98
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:04,381
- You guys want anything?
- No.

99
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:05,613
Here's your Bud.

100
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,156
<i>He was one of the most</i>
<i>notorious inmates.</i>

101
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,483
Here you go.

102
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,024
Thank you, sweetheart.

103
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,323
You're an unusual cop, Hobbes.

104
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:15,452
Really?

105
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:19,957
I've been in this precinct about what,
five, six months?

106
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,570
Everybody says,
"Hobbes don't take no cream."

107
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:24,538
"Hobbes don't take no cream."

108
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,072
Now is that true, or what?

109
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,809
No, I don't like cream.

110
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,970
That means no?

111
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:31,473
Yeah, it means no.

112
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:35,310
Now, is that "no" as in never,
"no" as in sometimes...

113
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:38,351
...or "no" as in I do
but I don't like to talk about it?

114
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:39,979
"No" as in never.

115
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,216
This is a big city, Hobbesy.

116
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,953
We got a tradition to uphold.

117
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:50,430
Got something wrong with your ears?
The man says something, he says it.

118
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,591
So, hypothetical...

119
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:55,603
...a cop who's trying to make ends meet
wants a little something on the side...

120
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,662
I don't like cream...

121
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,105
...and I don't judge.

122
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,841
You don't judge?

123
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,773
He's a fucking saint, huh?

124
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:05,405
So you're telling me
that under no circumstances...

125
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,243
...would a holy man like you ever,
you know...

126
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,578
...break the law or do something...

127
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,081
Look, Lou...

128
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:18,793
...I could jump across the table,
snatch your heart out of your chest...

129
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,795
...squeeze the blood out,
and stick it in your front pocket.

130
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:22,888
Oh, yeah?

131
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:25,690
If I lost control. But if I did...

132
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,727
...I'd be no different
than the people we bust.

133
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:31,970
Now, as to your general question...

134
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:35,138
You take any cop on the force,
cream or no...

135
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:39,178
...ninety-nine percent of the time
they're doing their job, aren't they?

136
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:40,471
Ninety-nine five.

137
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:41,880
Point five.

138
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,416
So he or she, cream or no...

139
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:48,050
...is doing more good out there every day...

140
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,489
...than any lawyer or a stockbroker or...

141
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,623
...president of the United States
can ever do in their lifetime.

142
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,193
Cops are the chosen people.

143
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:00,394
Amen.

144
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,008
Guess I'm switching to Bud.

145
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:15,150
Gracie, come here
and get this foreign shit off my table...

146
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:17,014
...and bring me three Buds.

147
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,136
Damn it, what took you so long?

148
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:45,872
You know what you'd look like
with this sandwich up your ass?

149
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:47,937
Pardon me?

150
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:51,479
Like a fat, stupid fuck
with a sandwich up his ass.

151
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,710
Charles, I hate to do this, but...

152
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,080
Put the job where the sandwich goes.

153
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:19,867
Hello?

154
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,770
Hello?

155
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:26,374
Hello?

156
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,655
Here we go. Juice, pretzels...

157
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:41,321
...apple...

158
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,954
...peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

159
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,658
Uncle John, will you please
make my lunch tomorrow?

160
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:47,895
Here's Toby.

161
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:52,004
I can't be having the same thing every day.

162
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:54,941
What do you want,
peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

163
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,473
Jelly and peanut butter?

164
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,515
I love you, Dad.

165
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,911
Don't forget your Uncle Johnny.

166
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:07,521
I feel the love in this room, man.

167
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:10,983
- Bye.
- Be good.

168
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:13,425
- Have a good day at school.
- Okay. Bye.

169
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,927
Doing a good job, Art.

170
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,194
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

171
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:22,230
Why don't you sit down with me?
Let's talk a bit.

172
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:23,566
You're not in a hurry?

173
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,436
No, no...

174
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,300
Relax today.

175
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:29,604
Besides, what are they going to do?
Fire me?

176
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,280
- How you doing?
- Okay.

177
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,146
- You all right?
- Yeah.

178
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,655
I love you, Johnny.

179
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,191
You ever think it would be easier,
your life would be easier...

180
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,299
...if maybe me and Sam
were not living with...

181
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:52,859
No, no.

182
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:57,898
- Maybe Marcy wouldn't have left.
- Later for Marcy.

183
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,837
If she loved me, she never would've left.

184
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:02,638
Besides, family's always first.
You're my brother.

185
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:08,313
I love you, too.

186
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,587
But don't make the boy any more
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

187
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:17,023
- No more peanut butter and jelly.
- Okay.

188
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,931
<i>A cop knows.</i>

189
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,767
<i>A cop sees.</i>

190
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,070
<i>Even the most casual thing, it registers.</i>

191
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:12,040
<i>Often you don't remember till later on.</i>
<i>But then...</i>

192
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,548
<i>... you look back and you realize...</i>

193
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:17,617
<i>... you knew.</i>

194
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,119
Good morning, Detective.

195
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,321
How you doing, Lieutenant?

196
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,223
Look who's feeling good today.

197
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:31,298
Hey, what can I say?
You're looking better than me.

198
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,298
Got a call on 4, Hobbes.

199
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:35,127
Thank you, Denise.

200
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:38,972
How's everything today? Good?

201
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:41,740
Detective Hobbes.

202
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,437
<i>Pal, you got a pen?</i>

203
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:45,539
<i>4541...</i>

204
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,877
<i>... South Stender, Apartment 2.</i>

205
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,610
Who's there?

206
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,583
<i>A clue, Magoo.</i>

207
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,751
Couldn't sleep last night.

208
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,985
Who can?

209
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:03,087
Remember I used to get calls at two or
three o'clock in the morning from Reese?

210
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,030
He loved you. He truly did.

211
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,227
Somebody called me last night.

212
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:08,867
Imagine that.

213
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:10,298
Denise.

214
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:14,067
Send a car to 4541 South Stender,
Apartment 2.

215
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,735
Make sure we gain entry.

216
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:16,835
Got a body?

217
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:21,178
No, it's probably some knucklehead,
saw me on TV trying to impress his girl.

218
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,375
- How'd I look last night?
- Fabulous.

219
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:25,283
You saw that? Four different channels.

220
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,844
You're a god. You're a god.

221
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,464
Name's Muskavich. Russian expatriate.

222
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:39,328
Super says no family,
no friends, no nothing.

223
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:41,292
Why is he dead, then?

224
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,536
What do you got?

225
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:48,238
I got puncture wounds.

226
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:51,373
Look for a syringe, or something.

227
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,039
Eighteen.

228
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:57,008
- What is that, his 18th victim?
- Could be.

229
00:18:58,153 --> 00:18:59,381
Could be.

230
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,056
Very tidy.

231
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,259
The DO A's been dead awhile,
so what the hell is this?

232
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,831
Killer slept over and then...

233
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:18,905
...had a nice, neat breakfast.

234
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,405
Looks like.

235
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,709
Check this out.

236
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:37,317
Shit.

237
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,849
What?

238
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,322
It's a riddle.

239
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:45,265
Reese, in his cell before he died,
he asked me, "Why is there a space...

240
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,527
"...between Lyons and Spakowsky?"

241
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:49,492
Yeah?

242
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:55,942
Accomplice?

243
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:58,437
Reese had an accomplice?

244
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,406
Unless it's a copycat. Maybe the...

245
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,116
...prison guards or the people
that made that documentary.

246
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:07,382
- You got a minute?
- I'll be there in a second.

247
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,357
Fifty people must have seen
that documentary by now.

248
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,290
Me and Jonesy will run them down.

249
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,924
Yeah, good.

250
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:19,300
Fingerprint. Perp wore no gloves.

251
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:22,801
Left prints on the spoon and cereal bowl
like he was advertising.

252
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:25,396
Maybe his prints aren't in the system.

253
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,566
I hate to be stupid...

254
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,973
Enjoy it, Lou.

255
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:30,575
...but is motive still something
we think about...

256
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,740
...or is it that all these
crimes are done out of sickness?

257
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,514
Number 2.

258
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,074
Everything is motive.

259
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:39,115
Sickness is motive.

260
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:40,448
Look sharp.

261
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,348
The coroner's prelim on the Ruski.

262
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:45,518
Isn't that the wacko poison
that Reese used on them Arab kids?

263
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,922
Tiff...

264
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,866
You like riddles?
You know, puzzles and shit? Brainteasers?

265
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,565
Sure, only if I do the teasing.

266
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:02,270
Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?

267
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,175
What does that even mean? Come on!

268
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,044
We had a Spakowsky in my rookie year.

269
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:08,446
South precinct.

270
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,943
Come again?

271
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,384
Not your Spakowsky. This guy's a cop.

272
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:14,885
Keep talking.

273
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,953
Guy's a fucking asshole.

274
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,288
He's the King Kong of assholes.
He's a fucking legend.

275
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:22,453
His name's up on a wall.

276
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:27,791
What?

277
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,869
Some chief in the '30s
thought it would boost morale.

278
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:38,507
They kept it up till '81 or '82,
and it got to be like a booby prize.

279
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:40,645
It was downtown in the lobby...

280
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,879
...till they remodeled.
Must've passed it by 1,000 times.

281
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:47,649
I guess I need to open my eyes
and look around sometime.

282
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,052
Lyons, I don't remember,
but Spakowsky was around.

283
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,056
This guy was so fucking mean
his wife shot him in the foot.

284
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,595
Who was '65?

285
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:58,164
Who was in that space?

286
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,996
You got me, bud. I don't know.

287
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:04,836
You're saying they took a name off?
Why would they do that?

288
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't know. I called Records.
They say they don't know who it was...

289
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:11,008
...and don't know why it's not there.

290
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:13,576
We better find out.

291
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:11,964
Lieutenant, just the man I wanted to see.

292
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,071
"Robert Milano."

293
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,339
That's right.

294
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,147
Cop of the Year, 1965.

295
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:25,343
Eight months later, goes up to a cabin,
middle of nowhere, dies cleaning his gun.

296
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,652
So it's either two things.
He was dirty or it was a woman.

297
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,149
What?

298
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:35,828
I met him once, Milano.

299
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:39,427
He had a poker up his ass,
but otherwise he was a good cop.

300
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,264
- What I want to know is...
- I know what you want.

301
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:44,504
I can't help you.

302
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,435
Can't help me?

303
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,934
Look...

304
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,103
...do all of us a favor, okay?

305
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,341
Whatever you find out...

306
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,207
...keep it to yourself.

307
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:01,680
I got something for you.

308
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:03,854
Documentary on Reese.

309
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,683
Thank you. You're a real white man.

310
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:08,289
Jonesy.

311
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,656
- Tape on Reese. You want to view it?
- Give me a sec.

312
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,764
What do you got on Muskavich?

313
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:15,302
Fingerprints were bust.

314
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,100
The crime scene says
the killer probably had dark hair.

315
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:19,640
He probably was left-handed.

316
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,300
Yeah, like Reese.

317
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:24,207
He had bad teeth.
Found a piece in the corn flakes.

318
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:26,509
<i>Directory Assistance.</i>

319
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:28,776
Can you give me a number on a Milano...

320
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,545
...Sylvia M-I-L-A-N-O.

321
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:31,914
<i>Hold, please.</i>

322
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:33,579
Hey, Lieutenant.

323
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:35,222
Excuse me, boss.

324
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:42,990
If somebody dies because you kept
your mouth shut, you're holding the bag.

325
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:45,827
When it's a perfect world, let me know.

326
00:24:46,434 --> 00:24:49,665
In the meantime,
it's not me keeping his mouth shut.

327
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,001
- Is that clear enough for you?
- Yeah.

328
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,003
<i>I'm sorry. There's no listing.</i>

329
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:57,577
Okay, thanks. No, listen, listen.
You still there? Hello?

330
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:02,080
Check and see if there's a G. Milano,
a Gretta Milano. Can you do that for me?

331
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,274
- <i>Hold, please.</i>
- Thanks.

332
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:05,182
Syringe had the same prints.

333
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:09,282
- So now what? Video time?
- Yeah.

334
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,156
You know, I was thinking...

335
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:14,627
Don't hurt yourself.

336
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:15,685
Eat me.

337
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,354
<i>Hold for the number.</i>

338
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:20,691
Whoever did Muskavich,
knew the poison that Reese used.

339
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:23,895
He quotes Reese. He could be a cop.

340
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:25,699
He could be, huh?

341
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:27,808
Lou, could be a cop, huh?

342
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,202
<i>Please leave a message. Thank you.</i>

343
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:33,776
<i>Make sure Hobbes gets a copy of this.</i>

344
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:37,280
<i>You watching, Johnny-boy?</i>
<i>I hope you're paying close attention.</i>

345
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:39,376
<i>Every gesture!</i>

346
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,713
<i>Every word!</i>

347
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:50,792
Wait a sec.

348
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:51,957
What?

349
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,623
Check something out.

350
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,064
That...

351
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,309
...language he was speaking...

352
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:04,739
...later.

353
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:06,312
That's Dutch?

354
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:08,739
That's what he said.

355
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,808
What's he speaking now? Is that Dutch?

356
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:13,979
This now?

357
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:18,188
This is mumbo-jumbo. Gibberish.

358
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,594
You sure on that?

359
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,778
<i>Who is it?</i>

360
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:46,513
<i>It's detective John Hobbes.</i>
<i>I'm looking for Miss Gretta Milano.</i>

361
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,290
- Oh, yes. You left a message.
- Yes.

362
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,617
I wanted to talk to you about your father.

363
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,233
How're you doing?

364
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:03,365
May I come in?

365
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,971
Sure.

366
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,581
You're surrounded by angels.

367
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:22,847
I teach theology at the university.

368
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:25,323
I see. Very beautiful.

369
00:27:25,493 --> 00:27:26,653
Thank you.

370
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:30,055
Why do you want to know
about my father?

371
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,837
It's 30 years later and the files are sealed...

372
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:41,532
...and my boss was told to let it alone, so...

373
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,704
...here I am.

374
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,845
I can tell you what my mother told me
before she died.

375
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:52,846
Why do you want to know?
Just curious, or...?

376
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:53,978
No, ma'am.

377
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:57,354
See, I'm the detective
who caught Edgar Reese.

378
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,292
I'm not sure if you're familiar with him.
He was just...

379
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,296
- Yeah, I read about him.
- Right, right.

380
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:05,026
And this Reese fella, he...

381
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:08,864
...in a roundabout way,
gave me your father's name.

382
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:15,567
Did Reese like to sing?

383
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,838
Yeah, he did, actually.

384
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:23,112
And at the execution,
did he try and touch you or grab you?

385
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:25,785
Yeah, he did. He shook my hand.

386
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,983
Want some coffee?

387
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:30,217
Sure.

388
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,117
Okay. One condition.

389
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,388
You and I never spoke.

390
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:40,629
You say nothing to your boss or partner.
Nothing goes in the files.

391
00:28:40,735 --> 00:28:44,296
My name and everything I say
is just between us. Agreed?

392
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,337
Will I get coffee if I say yes?

393
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,175
Detective, my dad was a good cop.

394
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:57,407
Pride of the force and all that.
And then he shot himself.

395
00:28:57,585 --> 00:29:00,918
A reporter found out
my father had been under investigation.

396
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,322
He'd caught a killer,
but copycat crimes started.

397
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:07,823
Evidence mounted against him.
Fingerprints, witnesses.

398
00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:12,160
The press never got real proof,
but my father's medal was rescinded.

399
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,425
I see.

400
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:18,772
So you're saying that when he died
someone made this evidence go away?

401
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:23,005
The mayor, governor and chief of police,
they all needed a hero.

402
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:25,443
Some of these people are
still important today.

403
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,107
- I see.
- No. Not yet, you don't.

404
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:33,014
My father saw the evidence,
told my mother he couldn't beat it.

405
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,745
So he went to this cabin in the mountains.

406
00:29:35,957 --> 00:29:39,188
It's a place that's been
in my mother's family for generations.

407
00:29:39,794 --> 00:29:41,284
He went there and...

408
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,795
The thing is...

409
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,699
...I know my father was innocent
of those murders.

410
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:51,632
How do you know?

411
00:29:53,908 --> 00:29:55,466
How do you know he was innocent?

412
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,174
It's 30 years ago.
It's not important anymore.

413
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:03,410
It's important to me, Miss Milano.

414
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:05,919
Don't you want the truth to come out,
the killer to be punished?

415
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:08,285
- Of course, I do.
- But?

416
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,894
Are you afraid if you tell me
your life may be in danger?

417
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:18,223
Yeah.

418
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,627
That's it?

419
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:21,526
Yes.

420
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,398
Okay.

421
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:28,472
Okay.

422
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:30,204
Thank you very much.

423
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:32,505
- For the coffee as well.
- Okay.

424
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,015
Oh, listen...

425
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,417
If I have any more questions,
can I call you?

426
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:41,553
I'd rather you didn't.

427
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:49,587
Detective...

428
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,496
Do you believe in God?

429
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:56,132
Yeah. I go to church every now and then.

430
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:58,905
What I see in my line of work...

431
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:01,138
...faith's a little hard to sustain.

432
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:04,769
Good luck.

433
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:17,720
<i>Sometimes I think the basic job</i>
<i>that human beings have...</i>

434
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:20,884
<i>... is just to figure out</i>
<i>what the hell is going on.</i>

435
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:23,394
<i>Example: Gretta Milano.</i>

436
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:27,057
<i>What was she hiding?</i>
<i>What was she so scared of?</i>

437
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:31,133
<i>And then her question about God.</i>
<i>What the hell is that all about?</i>

438
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:42,175
<i>You never know.</i>
<i>Down to the smallest thing.</i>

439
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:46,683
<i>That man who passes you</i>
<i>and catches your eye. Does he know you?</i>

440
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:51,257
<i>Did you go to school together? Is he a</i>
<i>homicidal maniac who hates you on sight?</i>

441
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,495
<i>Or is it nothing?</i>

442
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,195
<i>Nothing at all?</i>

443
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:49,805
Wake up.

444
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,780
Go to bed.

445
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,584
I know. I know.

446
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,662
Here we go. Up. Up.

447
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,230
I'm going, Uncle John.

448
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:11,096
Hello?

449
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,533
Hello?

450
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:20,074
Let's go, Sam.

451
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,353
Good night.

452
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:32,720
Good night, son.

453
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,327
- Johnny?
- Yeah?

454
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,401
You ever get scared?

455
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:45,202
Yeah, sometimes.

456
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:51,105
Me, too.

457
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,117
Good night, Art.

458
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,142
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mrs. Moohr? This is Charles.

459
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,407
Apparently I must have gotten drunk
or something...

460
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,647
...because the last few days...

461
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:36,019
Am I working tonight?

462
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,352
<i>You quit.</i>

463
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:39,250
I quit?

464
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,592
<i>Yes. You insulted Harry</i>
<i>and he hired someone else.</i>

465
00:34:42,697 --> 00:34:44,756
But... I mean... How...?

466
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:50,303
Look, I'm really sorry.

467
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:53,937
Could you apologize, please,
to your husband for whatever...

468
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,636
<i>We always liked you, Charles. Goodbye.</i>

469
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:18,993
Hello?

470
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:26,137
<i>Well, well, well. Look who's here.</i>

471
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:09,612
I played Reese's tape on the phone
to a linguist. He's coming down.

472
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:10,912
Yeah? Prelim?

473
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:12,850
Said it sounded Mideastern.

474
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,214
- Anything on Muskavich?
- Only the pizza.

475
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:17,689
We're hitting your area of expertise, huh?

476
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,749
Pizza is the staff of life.

477
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:23,860
Without pizza and other fine Italian foods,
there would be no happiness.

478
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,892
There was one slice left.

479
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:28,527
Garlic, linguiça and pineapple.

480
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:31,701
Plus there was nothing
in Muskavich's stomach.

481
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:33,170
So it was the killer's eats.

482
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:36,142
Hell of a clue. You better write
that one up for the journal.

483
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,270
I will, Lou. And I will laud you copiously.

484
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:40,703
Thank you.

485
00:36:40,815 --> 00:36:42,908
Detectives? Your guy's in video.

486
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:45,979
The linguist guy's here.

487
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,111
I'll be right there.

488
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:52,716
Any luck?

489
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,294
John Hobbes, Professor Richard Louders.

490
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:57,091
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

491
00:36:57,164 --> 00:36:59,155
This is completely exhilarating.

492
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:01,565
Who is this convict? Can I speak to him?

493
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,994
Not now. Have a seat.

494
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:08,035
Professor says it's a language.
He's just never heard it spoken aloud.

495
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:10,077
- Meaning?
- Some kind of antique.

496
00:37:10,244 --> 00:37:14,578
I believe this is a Biblical tongue.
Syrian Aramaic.

497
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:17,346
Only a few nomadic tribes still use it.

498
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:19,079
So you don't know what he's saying?

499
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,643
Haven't the faintest.

500
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,888
He's not too pleasant, is he?

501
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:27,386
But if you'd spare me a copy,
I'd be more than happy to work it.

502
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:31,629
Appreciate it. If you could wait
out front for 15 minutes...

503
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,525
...we'll dupe one off for you.

504
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:34,932
I'll be waiting.

505
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,600
- See you in a minute.
- Bye, Detective.

506
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:45,969
- Syrian Aramaic.
- Imagine that.

507
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,378
I got something else, too.
I'm looking up this clipping...

508
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,986
...of Reese, high-school baseball team.

509
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,178
He bats right.

510
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,521
He throws right.

511
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:01,088
What are you saying, Hobbes?

512
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:03,562
Reese pulled off the sickest shit on record.

513
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:07,965
He speaks a language 2,000 years old and
you're worried about his ambidexterity?

514
00:38:08,135 --> 00:38:09,762
I'm worried about everything.

515
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:11,964
- Hobbes, call on Line 1.
- Thank you, Bill.

516
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,403
Detective Hobbes.

517
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:18,809
<i>Hey, pal, need another clue?</i>

518
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,539
<i>1339 South Grove...</i>

519
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:23,245
<i>... Apartment 9.</i>

520
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:30,148
Jonesy, that pizza place
with the number 17?

521
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,483
Is that close to Grove?

522
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,055
I think so.

523
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,075
They're in the same place...

524
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,406
...exactly.

525
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,750
- It's like he's laughing at us.
- He is.

526
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:09,029
Cash, not check?

527
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,252
That's right.

528
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,106
Take a look at this.

529
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,037
What the hell is this?

530
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:36,113
You know what's scary?

531
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:42,628
I'm going home last night, this guy's
walking past me, he's going the other way.

532
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:45,365
He looks me right in the eye.

533
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,629
The kind of look like he knows you.
You know what I mean?

534
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:55,500
It's the same guy in the bathtub.

535
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,539
- The stiff.
- You're shitting me.

536
00:39:57,611 --> 00:39:59,306
I shit you not. Same guy.

537
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,605
Oh, man.

538
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:05,910
I ain't smart enough to figure this out.

539
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,078
Me, neither.

540
00:40:07,254 --> 00:40:08,516
Under the sink.

541
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:14,185
Same poison?

542
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:16,923
Same poison.
Better get that down to the lab.

543
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:20,025
- What else you got?
- The number on his chest.

544
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:22,827
Last Thursday it's 18, now it's 2?

545
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:27,067
Everything's under a Charles Olom,
but it looks like that's an alias.

546
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,335
So we're running his prints.

547
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,452
<i>Quote Yogi Berra,</i>
<i>"It's like déjä vu all over again."</i>

548
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:43,249
- <i>You mean Reese?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

549
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:47,685
<i>Whoever is doing it...</i>

550
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,193
<i>... has a thing for Hobbes.</i>

551
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,626
<i>Seems like.</i>

552
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,561
<i>How is he?</i>

553
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,033
<i>Who, Hobbes?</i>

554
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:59,538
<i>How is he ever? He's fine. He's great.</i>

555
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:03,003
<i>If it starts to work at him,</i>
<i>let me know, okay?</i>

556
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:06,679
And if it starts to work on me,
I'll let you know.

557
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:31,063
I thought that was you.

558
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:32,866
What are you doing, more...

559
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:34,599
...historical research?

560
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:40,209
Nice talking to you. See you Monday.

561
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,874
All right, Lou.

562
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:45,546
Come on, Jimmy.

563
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:47,086
Over here, shoot it!

564
00:41:47,154 --> 00:41:48,815
Shoot it, shoot it!

565
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:51,082
Come on, come on, Sam. Okay.

566
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,454
That's okay, that's okay.

567
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:55,126
Score is tied.

568
00:41:55,462 --> 00:41:57,123
No, 19 to 17.

569
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,993
You can take him.

570
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:00,829
- Pass the ball.
- I'm open.

571
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,559
Take the ball back.

572
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:07,439
Johnny's going to make a point.
He's got the ball.

573
00:42:07,508 --> 00:42:09,533
- Hiya, Art.
- How you doing?

574
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,143
Good one! Three, two, one!

575
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:15,878
That's it for me. I gotta go.

576
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,145
No, I gotta go. I have a long drive.

577
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,616
Art, get in here.

578
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:21,780
Uncle John, but he's a spaz.

579
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:25,554
You don't disrespect your father, okay?
You understand me?

580
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,283
Cherish what you got.

581
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,960
Get on in there.

582
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,055
- You want some?
- I didn't bring my shoes.

583
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,121
Come on.

584
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,492
What's up?

585
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:37,969
- Tiffany didn't get you?
- No, what's up?

586
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,197
You know how weird this case is?

587
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:43,476
We got a positive I. D...

588
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:45,644
...on Charles Olom.

589
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:48,309
Real name's Mickey Noons.

590
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:50,877
Born in Canada, illegal alien.

591
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:53,551
Blah, blah, blah. Smalltime shithead.

592
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,152
That ain't bad.

593
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,482
That ain't it.

594
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:01,723
Noons killed the Ruski. It's his prints
all over Muskavich's apartment.

595
00:43:01,895 --> 00:43:02,884
What?

596
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,091
Let's see, Noons poisons Muskavich...

597
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,359
...dumps him in the tub,
sets out the corn flakes.

598
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,335
Three days later somebody does
the exact same thing to him.

599
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:17,105
Exact, because Noons and Muskavich
were killed by the same person.

600
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,610
Some kind of ringmaster?

601
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,010
I think so.

602
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:22,912
Hey, Art.
You and Sam don't forget lunch, all right?

603
00:43:23,617 --> 00:43:26,415
I don't know.
I can't seem to get my mind around it.

604
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:29,180
I got a bad feeling about this.

605
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,751
Me, too.

606
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,354
Somebody's playing with my dick
and it ain't me.

607
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:37,596
Yeah. See you.

608
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:41,701
- Ten minutes, Art!
- Okay.

609
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:26,538
<i>There are moments which mark your life.</i>

610
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,034
<i>Moments when you realize</i>
<i>nothing will ever be the same.</i>

611
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:33,539
<i>And time is divided into two parts:</i>

612
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,013
<i>Before this...</i>

613
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:37,982
<i>... and after this.</i>

614
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:11,309
<i>Sometimes you can feel</i>
<i>such a moment coming.</i>

615
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:15,517
<i>That's the test. Or so I tell myself.</i>

616
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,658
<i>I tell myself that at times like that...</i>

617
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,920
<i>... strong people keep</i>
<i>moving forward anyway...</i>

618
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,595
<i>... no matter what they're going to find.</i>

619
00:49:42,996 --> 00:49:45,396
- Miss Milano.
- Oh, hello.

620
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,228
I went to your place in the mountains.

621
00:49:50,504 --> 00:49:52,335
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

622
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,101
Let me get that for you.

623
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:56,138
Trees and the water...

624
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:58,803
Absolutely beautiful.
What does "Azazel" mean?

625
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:05,248
Your father wrote it in the basement
on the wall, then he painted over it.

626
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,352
My dictionary...

627
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,350
...says that it's the...

628
00:50:09,523 --> 00:50:11,115
..."evil spirit of the wilderness."

629
00:50:11,191 --> 00:50:12,749
Whatever that means.

630
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,759
One of the books your father had up there
talks about demons...

631
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:17,797
...and how they move by touch.

632
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,489
Walk away, Mr. Hobbes.

633
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,027
- Say again?
- If you enjoy your life...

634
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:25,594
...if there's even one human being
you care about, don't take this case.

635
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:34,447
It's out of my hands, Miss Milano.
I mean, it's my job.

636
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:37,881
Bye, Mr. Hobbes.

637
00:50:39,186 --> 00:50:40,210
That's it?

638
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,777
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

639
00:50:56,903 --> 00:50:58,302
- Fax.
- Thanks.

640
00:51:01,274 --> 00:51:05,176
Phone company sent MUDs and LUDs
for Noons' and Muskavich's apartments.

641
00:51:05,245 --> 00:51:06,974
See those calls there?

642
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,842
They were made right around
the time they were killed.

643
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:13,576
You saying the killer called me
from the crime scene?

644
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:14,779
Sure looks like it.

645
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:17,619
- Reese used to call me at night.
- Reese is dead.

646
00:51:17,724 --> 00:51:20,420
Whoever's doing this
is in league with Reese...

647
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,223
...or was imitating Reese.
I know he's still calling my house.

648
00:51:24,765 --> 00:51:26,824
How many times I got to change
my phone number?

649
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,869
The more you change it, the more it
looks like someone on the inside.

650
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:31,233
Like a cop?

651
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:32,996
Yeah.

652
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,502
It's nothing to me...

653
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:42,909
...but the egos upstairs...

654
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:46,446
- You hear me?
- Both ears.

655
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:54,927
I'm going to lose my sense of humor.
What do you got?

656
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:56,886
Translation from the Aramaic.

657
00:51:57,764 --> 00:51:59,732
"I can't enter you by touch.

658
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,700
"But even when I can get inside you,
after I'm spirit, I won't.

659
00:52:04,237 --> 00:52:07,604
"I'll fuck you up and down, left and right."
That's in the Bible.

660
00:52:07,674 --> 00:52:09,869
"If that doesn't work, I have other ways."

661
00:52:09,943 --> 00:52:11,877
We need a translation of the translation.

662
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:23,988
Anything else?

663
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:26,453
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

664
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:03,393
<i>I like the night.</i>

665
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:04,992
<i>The street.</i>

666
00:53:05,165 --> 00:53:06,655
<i>The smells.</i>

667
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:09,260
<i>The sense of another world.</i>

668
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:17,742
<i>Sometimes you come</i>
<i>face to face with yourself.</i>

669
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,054
Now...

670
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:21,633
...put that card back in.

671
00:55:21,801 --> 00:55:23,598
- Anywhere.
- All right.

672
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,638
- Tell me when to stop, okay?
- Okay.

673
00:55:27,874 --> 00:55:30,069
Can you pronounce it for me again?

674
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,142
Okay, Professor, I think I got it. All right.

675
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:01,837
<i>I can get inside you.</i>
<i>After I'm spirit, I won't.</i>

676
00:56:02,342 --> 00:56:03,331
<i>No.</i>

677
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,506
<i>Better I get you for real.</i>

678
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:07,807
<i>Fuck you...</i>

679
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:11,009
<i>... up, down, left, right, coming, going.</i>

680
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,776
<i>I'll get so close to you...</i>

681
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,288
<i>... so close it breaks you.</i>

682
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,788
<i>And if that doesn't work...</i>

683
00:56:20,026 --> 00:56:21,516
<i>... I have other ways.</i>

684
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,153
<i>I have so many...</i>

685
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,627
<i>... many ways.</i>

686
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:45,239
Right.

687
00:56:45,452 --> 00:56:46,885
Fifteen minutes.

688
00:56:50,623 --> 00:56:52,090
Hi. Can I help you?

689
00:56:54,227 --> 00:56:56,695
You're releasing a Richard Suckle?

690
00:56:57,597 --> 00:57:00,395
- He called a cab.
- I'll have him brought right down.

691
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:08,866
- Looking good today.
- Thanks.

692
00:57:13,246 --> 00:57:14,736
Rap sheet on Bobby Stiggers.

693
00:57:14,814 --> 00:57:15,906
Thank you.

694
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,056
Hobbesy, tell me something.

695
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,119
Shoot.

696
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,688
The other day you were
in the basement reading a file.

697
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,592
What about it?

698
00:57:35,668 --> 00:57:38,535
Looked like a map in there.
You go somewhere?

699
00:57:39,572 --> 00:57:40,664
Up to the country.

700
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,571
It's great to get out of town.

701
00:57:42,675 --> 00:57:44,302
Lovely. Fresh air, you know?

702
00:57:44,911 --> 00:57:49,314
I used to do that. Go up to a house
in the mountains and sit by the water.

703
00:57:49,616 --> 00:57:50,913
It's beautiful.

704
00:57:52,752 --> 00:57:54,777
So I'm curious. Where'd you go?

705
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:57,684
Why you ask?

706
00:58:00,693 --> 00:58:01,751
Come here.

707
00:58:02,595 --> 00:58:03,653
Come here.

708
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:05,730
Come on, come here.

709
00:58:08,601 --> 00:58:10,330
"Time

710
00:58:11,704 --> 00:58:13,467
"Is on my side

711
00:58:14,607 --> 00:58:15,699
"Yes, it is

712
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,107
"Time

713
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,875
"Is on my side

714
00:58:21,548 --> 00:58:22,674
"Yes, it is"

715
00:58:23,016 --> 00:58:24,608
- Lou?
- What?

716
00:58:26,986 --> 00:58:28,351
"You're always saying

717
00:58:28,521 --> 00:58:30,421
"That you want to be free

718
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:32,989
"But I'll come running back"

719
00:58:52,812 --> 00:58:54,541
Why'd you sing that song?

720
00:58:55,048 --> 00:58:57,346
- Song?
- Why were you singing that song?

721
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:58,247
I sang?

722
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:01,219
They put you up to this?
Why did you sing that song?

723
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,117
What're you talking about?

724
00:59:02,188 --> 00:59:04,782
- You don't know what I'm talking about?
- No, I don't.

725
00:59:24,944 --> 00:59:26,104
Hey, you!

726
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,386
Syrian Aramaic.

727
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,158
How clever.

728
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:43,796
Jesus.

729
00:59:46,266 --> 00:59:47,824
It's true what I said.

730
00:59:48,368 --> 00:59:49,960
I do know who you are.

731
00:59:51,037 --> 00:59:52,197
Azazel.

732
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:54,262
Where'd you get that?

733
00:59:54,907 --> 00:59:56,374
From Milano's place?

734
00:59:56,909 --> 00:59:58,774
You found something up there.

735
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,876
Well, some things, pal,
you shouldn't know.

736
01:00:03,283 --> 01:00:04,511
Like what?

737
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:06,509
Like what?

738
01:00:07,387 --> 01:00:10,550
If you know, you should never, ever tell.

739
01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:22,367
Beware my wrath.

740
01:01:39,387 --> 01:01:40,479
Well?

741
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:45,692
What were you doing back then?

742
01:01:47,195 --> 01:01:50,130
- What are you talking about?
- You were singing.

743
01:01:51,466 --> 01:01:52,524
No.

744
01:01:52,968 --> 01:01:54,458
- I wasn't singing.
- You were.

745
01:01:54,536 --> 01:01:57,369
Lawrence and Mike were singing
some '60s thing.

746
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:58,733
There you go.

747
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,810
I wasn't singing it.
I hated the fucking '60s.

748
01:02:06,815 --> 01:02:08,180
I wasn't singing.

749
01:02:11,052 --> 01:02:13,987
I appreciate your situation, okay?
I really do.

750
01:02:15,156 --> 01:02:18,592
Your father, mother, they're dead,
their lives ruined, your life ruined.

751
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,287
I'm very sorry about that.

752
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:24,423
But I gotta know what's going on.
If this thing is what it seems to be...

753
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:27,791
...if this thing is
what the book says that it is, then...

754
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:37,271
Is this for real? Do you believe this stuff?

755
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,313
I believe more is hidden than is seen.

756
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:43,511
I believe what I see. I'm trying to get
my mind around what I just saw.

757
01:02:43,985 --> 01:02:45,282
Something...

758
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,751
...threatened me.

759
01:02:47,489 --> 01:02:49,457
Reese threatened me in Aramaic.

760
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,457
What else did Reese say?

761
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,527
I'm asking the questions here.

762
01:02:53,762 --> 01:02:58,665
You answer the questions I ask.
Because if I don't know what's going on...

763
01:02:58,767 --> 01:03:01,964
We're not supposed to know.
We're not supposed to see.

764
01:03:02,203 --> 01:03:04,831
It's like the Mafia. They don't even exist.

765
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,237
Okay... okay.

766
01:03:06,641 --> 01:03:09,201
That's good. That's a start.
They don't even exist.

767
01:03:09,711 --> 01:03:12,373
So where are they from?
Who the hell are they?

768
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,345
There are certain phenomena...

769
01:03:15,517 --> 01:03:18,816
...which can only be explained
if there is a god...

770
01:03:19,354 --> 01:03:22,380
...and if there are angels.
And there are. They exist.

771
01:03:22,957 --> 01:03:27,553
Some angels were cast down. A few
were punished by being deprived of form.

772
01:03:28,029 --> 01:03:31,328
They can only survive in the bodies
of others. It's inside of us.

773
01:03:31,399 --> 01:03:34,163
Inside of human beings,
their vengeance is played out.

774
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:38,932
That's it?

775
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:41,804
Come on, get out of here.

776
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:44,034
Come on.

777
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:45,839
I mean...

778
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:48,575
Miss Milano, I'm just a cop, okay?

779
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,012
I'm a detective.

780
01:03:50,085 --> 01:03:52,315
My work is based upon evidence, facts.

781
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:54,183
Mine, too. Mine, too.

782
01:03:54,489 --> 01:03:58,721
Aren't your facts here
rather resistant to normal interpretation?

783
01:04:00,395 --> 01:04:02,056
So you're saying that...

784
01:04:02,597 --> 01:04:04,087
...Edgar Reese is actually...

785
01:04:04,232 --> 01:04:06,996
At the time you knew him,
he was not himself.

786
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:09,000
- He was Azazel?
- Yes, Azazel.

787
01:04:09,371 --> 01:04:11,896
Sadistic, left-handed, likes to sing.

788
01:04:12,073 --> 01:04:14,735
Reese? Why does he focus in on me?

789
01:04:14,909 --> 01:04:17,639
You got his attention.
He tried to get inside you.

790
01:04:17,712 --> 01:04:22,274
He shook your hand. That didn't work,
so now he'll try and find some other way.

791
01:04:24,853 --> 01:04:26,514
Like he did with your father?

792
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:37,293
How do we fight him? Is it possible?

793
01:04:37,432 --> 01:04:39,525
I believe it is. And I'm not alone.

794
01:04:40,068 --> 01:04:43,333
There's a network. I don't even know
who they are. I just have numbers.

795
01:04:43,438 --> 01:04:45,201
These people know the...

796
01:04:45,373 --> 01:04:48,809
We believe that God limited demons
and made them mortal.

797
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:51,244
He put a few of us here to fight them.

798
01:04:51,813 --> 01:04:53,474
Us? Us who?

799
01:04:53,815 --> 01:04:55,009
Who, us?

800
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:57,681
You saying I'm one of these people?

801
01:04:58,153 --> 01:05:00,747
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not.

802
01:05:01,256 --> 01:05:03,156
You're just doing your job.

803
01:05:04,092 --> 01:05:05,184
Okay.

804
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:06,687
Touché.

805
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,592
So these demons are mortal?
They can be killed?

806
01:05:09,664 --> 01:05:11,359
- By the right person.
- Who is?

807
01:05:11,433 --> 01:05:13,628
This is religion, Mr. Hobbes.

808
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:17,471
These are matters of fate and divine order.
The right man...

809
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:19,166
- Or woman.
- Yes.

810
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,239
It could be you, me, anybody?

811
01:05:21,309 --> 01:05:24,870
The right person of the right character
with the right knowledge...

812
01:05:24,946 --> 01:05:27,039
So, this is what you've been doing.

813
01:05:27,115 --> 01:05:29,675
You've been preparing for this,
haven't you?

814
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,822
Can I ask you something personal?

815
01:05:37,425 --> 01:05:39,518
Everything's personal if you're a person.

816
01:05:40,261 --> 01:05:42,058
Is this why you live alone?

817
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:48,130
There's a difference between
risking for yourself and someone else.

818
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:49,563
That's true.

819
01:05:50,004 --> 01:05:50,993
I mean...

820
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:55,873
...if I had someone, I'd want to share
my life and thoughts, and work with them.

821
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:59,812
If I shared this, I'd put them at risk
and I don't have that right.

822
01:06:01,683 --> 01:06:03,116
You can talk to me.

823
01:06:03,451 --> 01:06:06,420
You don't have to. I'm not saying that.
I'm not, you know...

824
01:06:06,988 --> 01:06:10,685
Do whatever you want to do. I'm just
saying you can talk to me if you want.

825
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,486
Thanks.

826
01:06:14,128 --> 01:06:16,392
That's a very nice thing to say.

827
01:06:17,232 --> 01:06:18,790
I've got to go.

828
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,901
I hope I've been helpful.

829
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,401
- Thanks for listening.
- Thank you.

830
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:34,800
I'm sorry.

831
01:07:34,943 --> 01:07:36,808
I was about to tap you on the shoulder.

832
01:07:37,245 --> 01:07:39,577
You're a friend of John Hobbes, right?

833
01:07:40,315 --> 01:07:41,646
I'm Jay Reynolds.

834
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:46,342
You know?

835
01:07:47,956 --> 01:07:49,150
How lovely.

836
01:07:51,492 --> 01:07:53,426
You're not just Hobbes' chippy.

837
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,457
Have we met?

838
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,325
You seem vaguely familiar.

839
01:07:58,967 --> 01:08:00,059
Come on...

840
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,293
...tell me.

841
01:08:02,437 --> 01:08:04,337
I'm about to find out anyway.

842
01:08:10,511 --> 01:08:11,500
Foreplay.

843
01:08:11,813 --> 01:08:12,802
Watch out.

844
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,279
No, you don't!

845
01:08:39,707 --> 01:08:41,038
Please, help me!

846
01:08:43,211 --> 01:08:44,735
Go! Go!

847
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,903
- Open up!
- Go!

848
01:08:56,057 --> 01:08:57,752
Jesus, are you all right?

849
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:21,877
You all right?

850
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,555
Thanks for coming.

851
01:09:35,329 --> 01:09:36,557
I ran.

852
01:09:38,332 --> 01:09:40,129
He came after me and I ran.

853
01:09:43,337 --> 01:09:44,565
Maybe you weren't ready yet.

854
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:47,301
That's the point. You have to be ready.

855
01:09:48,209 --> 01:09:49,699
You know what it is?

856
01:09:51,446 --> 01:09:53,710
I never believed this day would come.

857
01:09:54,415 --> 01:09:57,145
I thought God would make it up to me.
I'd be good...

858
01:09:57,218 --> 01:09:59,743
...and God would show me
an angel instead.

859
01:10:02,557 --> 01:10:04,047
Do they know who you are?

860
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:11,894
We shouldn't be seen together.

861
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,960
Not anymore.

862
01:10:20,575 --> 01:10:22,167
Wipe your tear.

863
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,786
Wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

864
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:39,489
How you doing?

865
01:10:40,094 --> 01:10:41,083
Fine.

866
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,322
Murders not getting you wound up?

867
01:10:44,766 --> 01:10:48,668
Bag the chocolates. You ain't got
to talk to me sideways. What's up?

868
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,798
Where were you
when Muskavich and Noons were killed?

869
01:10:54,275 --> 01:10:55,572
Where was I?

870
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:57,533
Am I a suspect?

871
01:10:58,579 --> 01:10:59,773
Sit down.

872
01:11:03,818 --> 01:11:05,308
Not to me, you're not.

873
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:06,375
But...

874
01:11:06,954 --> 01:11:10,856
Lieutenant, you know...
What is it, the phone records again?

875
01:11:11,826 --> 01:11:13,316
What do they think?

876
01:11:13,427 --> 01:11:17,124
I committed murder, then called home,
then ran home and answered my phone?

877
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:18,859
No, it's something else.

878
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:20,998
Your prints.

879
01:11:21,869 --> 01:11:22,961
My prints?

880
01:11:23,638 --> 01:11:24,662
On what?

881
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,305
On that fucking little coin of yours.

882
01:11:28,009 --> 01:11:29,874
- Where?
- Noons' place.

883
01:11:40,221 --> 01:11:41,483
Shit.

884
01:11:43,491 --> 01:11:44,924
This is a frame-up.

885
01:11:45,326 --> 01:11:46,122
Is it?

886
01:11:46,194 --> 01:11:47,957
Anybody could have got those coins.

887
01:11:48,062 --> 01:11:51,088
They could have got them
when I'm at the store or something.

888
01:11:51,165 --> 01:11:53,156
They could've taken them off my desk.

889
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,326
We always said it could be a cop.

890
01:11:57,305 --> 01:11:58,897
We did always say that.

891
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,337
I'm not stupid, you know.

892
01:12:02,009 --> 01:12:04,239
I know you know more than you're saying.

893
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:05,939
So tell me.

894
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,910
You don't really want to know.

895
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:14,652
You'd have to be there.
I was there and I don't even want to know.

896
01:12:14,722 --> 01:12:15,916
Try me.

897
01:12:22,063 --> 01:12:23,690
Remember Robert Milano?

898
01:12:24,198 --> 01:12:25,392
Listen to me.

899
01:12:25,499 --> 01:12:28,093
This is exactly what happened to him.

900
01:12:30,071 --> 01:12:31,402
He was framed.

901
01:12:35,109 --> 01:12:36,872
I'll give you some advice.

902
01:12:38,212 --> 01:12:40,373
Let go of it for a couple of hours.

903
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:41,943
Go home.

904
01:12:42,516 --> 01:12:43,915
See your family.

905
01:12:44,418 --> 01:12:45,908
Take a load off.

906
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:55,319
<i>The hell with Stanton.</i>

907
01:12:55,963 --> 01:12:57,658
<i>The hell with all of them.</i>

908
01:12:58,099 --> 01:13:00,624
<i>Nobody likes to get</i>
<i>the shit kicked out of them.</i>

909
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,470
<i>Nobody likes to get hit from every angle.</i>

910
01:13:03,537 --> 01:13:06,802
<i>But evil just keeps on coming.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

911
01:13:07,308 --> 01:13:09,469
<i>You saw it before, but now...</i>

912
01:13:10,077 --> 01:13:13,308
<i>... it's in your face, laughing at you.</i>

913
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,181
- Hi, Unc.
- Hey, Sam.

914
01:13:19,787 --> 01:13:20,947
How you doing?

915
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,284
Hi, Mr. Hobbes.

916
01:13:24,225 --> 01:13:25,886
You're home early today.

917
01:13:26,794 --> 01:13:28,125
For a change.

918
01:13:56,791 --> 01:13:58,850
- Did you move my address book?
- What?

919
01:13:58,926 --> 01:13:59,950
No.

920
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:02,222
What?

921
01:14:08,703 --> 01:14:10,295
What's wrong with your eye?

922
01:14:15,309 --> 01:14:16,742
Who hit you in the eye?

923
01:14:17,878 --> 01:14:18,902
I fell.

924
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,572
You fell?

925
01:14:21,949 --> 01:14:23,712
I fell, or something.

926
01:14:24,952 --> 01:14:27,079
People don't fall down and get a black eye.

927
01:14:27,154 --> 01:14:28,644
- No?
- No.

928
01:14:31,192 --> 01:14:32,853
All right, it's okay.

929
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,052
It's okay.

930
01:14:35,629 --> 01:14:36,926
What happened?

931
01:14:38,466 --> 01:14:39,763
Sammy hit me.

932
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:40,990
What?

933
01:14:41,068 --> 01:14:43,935
It was an accident though.
He didn't mean to.

934
01:14:44,572 --> 01:14:46,301
<i>He didn't mean to.</i>

935
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:50,166
It was an accident. It was an accident!

936
01:14:50,244 --> 01:14:51,836
John... John!

937
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:53,137
Sam?

938
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,173
Where's Toby?

939
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:58,345
Outside, I guess.

940
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,049
Okay, go back in the house.

941
01:15:08,496 --> 01:15:10,259
- Toby?
- Hey, Hobbes.

942
01:15:16,604 --> 01:15:18,469
Leave my family alone, you hear me?

943
01:15:19,407 --> 01:15:20,499
Go back in the house.

944
01:15:20,574 --> 01:15:22,940
- What's going on?
- Go back in the house!

945
01:15:28,516 --> 01:15:30,643
- You leave my family alone.
- Why?

946
01:15:31,085 --> 01:15:34,521
You come after me.
Now I come after you and yours.

947
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:01,241
Toby, you all right?

948
01:16:01,916 --> 01:16:03,315
Go right home. Go.

949
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:04,817
- I will.
- Run.

950
01:16:27,908 --> 01:16:30,001
What's the matter, pal?
Afraid to fight me?

951
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,570
Come on, Hobbes. Come on out.

952
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:36,811
Come on, Hobbes.

953
01:16:38,285 --> 01:16:39,445
Put the gun down.

954
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:42,852
I knew you'd come out.

955
01:16:42,923 --> 01:16:44,515
Put the gun on the ground!

956
01:16:44,925 --> 01:16:46,358
I know you, Hobbes.

957
01:16:46,494 --> 01:16:48,086
Set the gun down, sir!

958
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,061
Put the gun down!

959
01:18:04,371 --> 01:18:05,531
"Yes, it is

960
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:08,198
"Time

961
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:11,603
"Is on my side"

962
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:13,273
Hey, pal.

963
01:18:14,715 --> 01:18:16,046
Wake up, Hobbes.

964
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,979
I'm not that easy to kill.

965
01:18:18,252 --> 01:18:22,484
When my host dies and I move as spirit,
no man can resist me.

966
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:27,121
What are you going to do, arrest me?
What'll you tell Stanton?

967
01:18:27,194 --> 01:18:29,059
I'd love to hear that one.

968
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:30,897
It's me you want, isn't it?

969
01:18:31,765 --> 01:18:33,528
Why don't you just kill me?

970
01:18:33,934 --> 01:18:35,629
But I'm still having fun.

971
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:38,435
Aren't you still having fun?

972
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:31,888
He was standing in the street,
yelling at him.

973
01:19:31,959 --> 01:19:34,553
Shooting at him.
Finally, when the officer...

974
01:19:35,863 --> 01:19:37,262
I guess that's it.

975
01:19:44,872 --> 01:19:47,466
There's no question
that the dead man shot first.

976
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:51,136
No question at all.
My wife saw it too, if you want to ask her.

977
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,646
A schoolteacher.

978
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:58,976
What am I going to say?

979
01:19:59,053 --> 01:20:00,611
What am I going to do?

980
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:04,819
We know that he fired first.
Witnesses corroborate.

981
01:20:04,992 --> 01:20:09,019
But his gun was filled with blanks.
He got the gun out of a stolen car.

982
01:20:09,129 --> 01:20:10,756
- It was a setup.
- A setup?

983
01:20:10,831 --> 01:20:12,162
That's right. A setup.

984
01:20:12,499 --> 01:20:14,399
He sets it up for you to kill him?

985
01:20:14,468 --> 01:20:15,696
Committing suicide by...

986
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:16,827
Excuse me.

987
01:20:19,306 --> 01:20:21,240
What the hell are you doing out here?

988
01:20:21,575 --> 01:20:24,510
You take Sam home,
lock every door, every window...

989
01:20:24,678 --> 01:20:27,272
You don't let anybody in. Can you do that?

990
01:20:27,748 --> 01:20:30,080
Can you remember that? All right, do it.

991
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:31,640
- Johnny?
- Yeah.

992
01:20:32,653 --> 01:20:34,120
Are you mad at me or something?

993
01:20:35,356 --> 01:20:37,085
No, Art. Never. Just...

994
01:20:38,559 --> 01:20:39,992
Do what I told you.

995
01:20:44,665 --> 01:20:47,190
Hate to see the mighty fall,
you know what I mean?

996
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:50,469
Now it's letters. Fuck you, Lou.

997
01:20:51,605 --> 01:20:53,402
I told you, it's a cult.

998
01:20:53,741 --> 01:20:57,643
Some weird, psycho,
Aramaic-Satanist reincarnation cult.

999
01:20:58,178 --> 01:21:00,078
He's got A-P-O written on his chest.

1000
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,207
It's trying to send some kind of message.

1001
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:08,212
The killer's sending a message?

1002
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:11,123
Hobbes...

1003
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,461
This time, you are the killer.

1004
01:21:16,096 --> 01:21:17,085
Yeah, sort of.

1005
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:18,631
No fucking sort of.

1006
01:21:18,966 --> 01:21:21,230
No breaks. No benefit of the doubt.

1007
01:21:21,735 --> 01:21:24,568
We're going back to the precinct. Now.

1008
01:21:36,216 --> 01:21:38,707
<i>Tonight, another shocking murder</i>
<i>in the city.</i>

1009
01:21:38,886 --> 01:21:43,380
<i>A well-respected schoolteacher</i>
<i>opened fire on an off-duty police officer.</i>

1010
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:44,750
<i>The officer...</i>

1011
01:21:44,992 --> 01:21:47,984
<i>... John Hobbes, was forced to return fire.</i>

1012
01:21:48,462 --> 01:21:50,089
<i>Our report now, from the scene.</i>

1013
01:21:50,898 --> 01:21:54,390
<i>We're on the scene</i>
<i>of a most unusual homicide tonight.</i>

1014
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,165
Close the door.

1015
01:21:56,336 --> 01:21:59,533
<i>Detective Hobbes shot and killed</i>
<i>a high-school math teacher.</i>

1016
01:21:59,606 --> 01:22:01,870
<i>The police have not yet identified him.</i>

1017
01:22:01,942 --> 01:22:05,036
<i>According to witnesses,</i>
<i>the man started shooting at Hobbes...</i>

1018
01:22:05,112 --> 01:22:07,103
<i>... who was off duty at the time.</i>

1019
01:22:08,982 --> 01:22:11,280
Talked to the schoolteacher's wife.

1020
01:22:12,085 --> 01:22:13,609
He got married four months ago.

1021
01:22:13,687 --> 01:22:15,848
She's pregnant. He just got a raise.

1022
01:22:16,623 --> 01:22:18,818
So much for suicide by cop!

1023
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,529
The shooting team needs your gun.

1024
01:22:27,634 --> 01:22:29,966
I'll get the hearing as soon as I can.

1025
01:22:31,305 --> 01:22:33,205
People want the world to make sense.

1026
01:22:33,273 --> 01:22:37,801
If the only way I can get the world
to make sense for me is to arrest you...

1027
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:39,969
...then I'll have to do it.

1028
01:22:44,284 --> 01:22:45,478
Get the fuck out of here.

1029
01:23:29,263 --> 01:23:31,288
- It was a clean shoot.
- Yeah, I know.

1030
01:23:31,565 --> 01:23:33,294
It doesn't help, but I know.

1031
01:23:35,035 --> 01:23:36,127
Coffee?

1032
01:23:36,436 --> 01:23:37,664
No, thanks.

1033
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:42,607
Want to talk? From where I sit, we're
dealing with shit that ain't in the manual.

1034
01:23:46,013 --> 01:23:49,244
Where do they buy coffee with dirt in it?
Tell me that.

1035
01:23:54,054 --> 01:23:55,988
What's the point of life?

1036
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:58,882
- The point?
- Yeah.

1037
01:24:01,595 --> 01:24:03,187
- Of life.
- Yeah.

1038
01:24:06,466 --> 01:24:07,990
The point... You want a cigarette?

1039
01:24:08,068 --> 01:24:09,228
No, thanks.

1040
01:24:12,906 --> 01:24:14,931
The point of life is we catch bad guys.

1041
01:24:15,576 --> 01:24:17,476
That's what I used to think.

1042
01:24:19,479 --> 01:24:20,969
It's not good enough.

1043
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,206
You'll shoot me for talking like this but...

1044
01:24:24,751 --> 01:24:27,311
It's two o'clock in the morning.
You can talk any way you want.

1045
01:24:30,257 --> 01:24:32,555
What are we doing here,
you know what I'm saying?

1046
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,525
Why do we even exist?

1047
01:24:34,595 --> 01:24:35,584
Us.

1048
01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:39,427
Maybe it's God, Hobbes.

1049
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,865
Yeah, it could be.

1050
01:24:44,905 --> 01:24:47,430
I have a hard time believing that we're...

1051
01:24:48,241 --> 01:24:50,175
...part of some huge...

1052
01:24:51,011 --> 01:24:54,879
...moral experiment, you know,
conducted by a greater being than us.

1053
01:24:55,248 --> 01:24:59,048
If there's a greater being than we are,
why does he give a shit about us?

1054
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:02,920
There's five billion of us.
We're like ants. Do we care...

1055
01:25:03,256 --> 01:25:05,554
...what ants do from a moral standpoint?

1056
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:06,784
Ants?

1057
01:25:07,861 --> 01:25:11,353
I'm following you,
but at the same time I'm losing you.

1058
01:25:11,832 --> 01:25:13,697
Are you heading someplace here?

1059
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:15,359
That's my point.

1060
01:25:15,869 --> 01:25:17,530
Are we headed someplace?

1061
01:25:18,271 --> 01:25:20,034
If we don't figure it out...

1062
01:25:22,643 --> 01:25:24,543
Maybe if you figure it out...

1063
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:27,371
...you die.

1064
01:25:27,514 --> 01:25:30,449
Heart attack, stroke.
You figure out what's what...

1065
01:25:31,318 --> 01:25:34,515
...you don't get to hang around anymore.
You get promoted.

1066
01:25:36,623 --> 01:25:38,284
Meanwhile, Delores...

1067
01:25:39,693 --> 01:25:41,752
...says we're put here to do one thing.

1068
01:25:41,895 --> 01:25:43,021
One thing?

1069
01:25:43,964 --> 01:25:45,022
What's that?

1070
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:48,795
It's different. It's different for everybody.
Hers is lasagna.

1071
01:25:49,202 --> 01:25:50,396
Lasagna?

1072
01:25:51,872 --> 01:25:53,669
And just one thing, not two or...?

1073
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,570
Maybe two, I don't know.
It's just her opinion.

1074
01:25:57,411 --> 01:25:58,742
But it's like...

1075
01:26:00,414 --> 01:26:02,177
...when a moment comes...

1076
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:05,641
...we either do the right thing...

1077
01:26:06,586 --> 01:26:07,484
...or wrong.

1078
01:26:09,556 --> 01:26:11,319
When do you know
when your moment comes?

1079
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:24,194
So, like this could be it for me?

1080
01:26:24,271 --> 01:26:26,171
That's the beauty. You never know.

1081
01:26:29,409 --> 01:26:30,603
- Hello?
- <i>John?</i>

1082
01:26:30,877 --> 01:26:32,208
Is that you?

1083
01:26:34,214 --> 01:26:37,047
Hi. I just wanted to see if you were okay.

1084
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:40,642
I'll call you back. I'll call you later.

1085
01:26:48,295 --> 01:26:50,923
That was the killer.
We'll arrange things later.

1086
01:27:03,043 --> 01:27:04,305
I'm going home.

1087
01:27:05,979 --> 01:27:07,469
Yeah, fuck it.

1088
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:23,128
<i>I killed someone.</i>

1089
01:27:23,463 --> 01:27:25,556
<i>He got me to kill an innocent man.</i>

1090
01:27:26,433 --> 01:27:27,695
<i>I know.</i>

1091
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:29,763
<i>What do they want, Gretta?</i>

1092
01:27:30,504 --> 01:27:32,335
<i>Just tell me what they want.</i>

1093
01:27:32,405 --> 01:27:33,804
<i>The demons?</i>

1094
01:27:34,274 --> 01:27:36,265
<i>They want the fall of civilization.</i>

1095
01:27:36,343 --> 01:27:38,834
<i>The fall of Babylon, as they put it.</i>

1096
01:27:39,346 --> 01:27:41,075
- <i>The whole thing?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1097
01:27:42,349 --> 01:27:44,715
<i>They're doing a good job, aren't they?</i>

1098
01:27:45,085 --> 01:27:47,451
<i>You know, after I shot the teacher...</i>

1099
01:27:48,188 --> 01:27:49,951
<i>... Azazel moved to someone else.</i>

1100
01:27:50,023 --> 01:27:52,423
<i>Are you sure? After death?</i>

1101
01:27:52,759 --> 01:27:55,353
<i>I'm positive. After death. Yeah, I saw it.</i>

1102
01:27:55,529 --> 01:27:56,655
<i>Listen to this.</i>

1103
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,597
<i>I was looking through</i>
<i>one of your father's books...</i>

1104
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:04,537
<i>... and it says "outside"...</i>
<i>I guess that means outside the body.</i>

1105
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:09,038
<i>Outside, they can survive</i>
<i>for one breath only.</i>

1106
01:28:09,776 --> 01:28:13,439
<i>A Hebrew text says the breath</i>
<i>can carry them for 500 cubits.</i>

1107
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:15,441
<i>I never knew what it meant.</i>

1108
01:28:15,515 --> 01:28:18,143
<i>A cubit, that's a distance</i>
<i>or something, right?</i>

1109
01:28:18,218 --> 01:28:20,243
<i>From your elbow to your fingertip.</i>

1110
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:24,313
<i>So 500 cubits would be what?</i>
<i>About a sixth of a mile?</i>

1111
01:28:24,524 --> 01:28:26,617
<i>Yeah, well, you're right then.</i>

1112
01:28:27,961 --> 01:28:30,054
They are limited in certain ways.

1113
01:28:32,465 --> 01:28:34,023
What are you thinking?

1114
01:28:35,068 --> 01:28:36,296
I don't know.

1115
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:41,132
I don't know. You okay?

1116
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:43,299
Yeah.

1117
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:45,275
<i>All right. Well, then...</i>

1118
01:28:46,246 --> 01:28:48,043
...maybe I'll check on you tomorrow.

1119
01:28:51,051 --> 01:28:52,211
Good night.

1120
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,377
Good night.

1121
01:29:17,244 --> 01:29:18,438
Good morning, Sam.

1122
01:29:20,013 --> 01:29:21,241
Good morning, Sam.

1123
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:22,747
Oh, hi, Uncle John.

1124
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:23,874
Oh, hi.

1125
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:27,176
- Thanks for tucking me in last night.
- You're welcome.

1126
01:29:29,789 --> 01:29:32,019
<i>We sent Michael Aaron to the scene...</i>

1127
01:29:32,192 --> 01:29:36,390
<i>... where he'll be ready with a live report</i>
<i>shortly. We'll be right back.</i>

1128
01:30:29,182 --> 01:30:31,082
Were you asleep when I tucked you in?

1129
01:30:31,851 --> 01:30:35,617
I don't know.
All I remember was somebody tickling me.

1130
01:30:35,855 --> 01:30:37,220
Tickling my chest.

1131
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:44,920
Why'd you write that?

1132
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,591
- Where's your father?
- In the bedroom.

1133
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:51,034
He's a sleepyhead.

1134
01:30:56,476 --> 01:30:59,536
<i>If you've watched the national news</i>
<i>just last week...</i>

1135
01:30:59,713 --> 01:31:02,147
<i>... you might have seen</i>
<i>a similar case in Boston...</i>

1136
01:31:02,215 --> 01:31:04,877
<i>... of a decorated cop accused of murder.</i>

1137
01:33:21,955 --> 01:33:22,785
Hello?

1138
01:33:23,256 --> 01:33:24,587
You see the news?

1139
01:33:25,091 --> 01:33:28,356
<i>The cop was shooting first.</i>
<i>And he kept on shooting.</i>

1140
01:33:29,762 --> 01:33:31,320
Lou's coming to get you.

1141
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:33,558
He's bringing you down
for more conversation.

1142
01:33:33,633 --> 01:33:34,930
- Lou?
- No.

1143
01:33:35,268 --> 01:33:37,566
- They get him yet?
- No. Not yet.

1144
01:33:39,506 --> 01:33:41,030
I gotta go.

1145
01:34:18,711 --> 01:34:21,441
Here. Put these clothes on.
Get dressed right away.

1146
01:34:21,514 --> 01:34:23,573
- Why?
- Just do as I tell you, please.

1147
01:34:33,593 --> 01:34:34,651
You ready?

1148
01:34:34,761 --> 01:34:37,093
Almost. What's going on here?

1149
01:34:37,263 --> 01:34:40,699
We're just going to play
a little trick on somebody.

1150
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,089
Cool.

1151
01:34:47,173 --> 01:34:49,004
We're going out the window.

1152
01:34:52,278 --> 01:34:53,677
What about my dad?

1153
01:34:55,582 --> 01:34:58,210
He's sleeping. He's still sleeping.

1154
01:35:45,798 --> 01:35:48,562
- Excuse me, Sister. How you doing?
- Good.

1155
01:35:48,968 --> 01:35:49,957
Good.

1156
01:35:51,304 --> 01:35:53,898
Does "apocalypse" mean anything to you?

1157
01:35:54,641 --> 01:35:55,835
Sure it does.

1158
01:35:56,009 --> 01:35:58,910
Apocalypse was
the Greek word for revelation.

1159
01:35:59,445 --> 01:36:00,776
Revelation?

1160
01:36:01,814 --> 01:36:03,577
You mean like the book of the Bible?

1161
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:05,442
Revelation.

1162
01:36:05,618 --> 01:36:07,017
All right. Thank you.

1163
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,217
Pack of cigarettes.

1164
01:36:39,652 --> 01:36:41,313
- Any special kind?
- No, any kind.

1165
01:36:42,388 --> 01:36:44,185
Okay, out of five.

1166
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,491
Detective Hobbes?

1167
01:36:49,295 --> 01:36:50,887
Sir, you forgot your change.

1168
01:36:50,963 --> 01:36:52,487
Detective Hobbes.

1169
01:36:52,899 --> 01:36:54,457
I want to talk to you.

1170
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:01,737
Go, Sam. Run! Down the stairs,
down the stairs! Go!

1171
01:37:02,175 --> 01:37:03,642
All units in the area...

1172
01:37:43,216 --> 01:37:45,116
Why don't you close that coat up?

1173
01:37:57,630 --> 01:37:58,722
Cigarettes?

1174
01:37:59,232 --> 01:38:01,962
I thought you quit.
I thought they were bad for you.

1175
01:38:02,068 --> 01:38:04,127
I did quit and they are bad for you.

1176
01:38:07,774 --> 01:38:09,469
You know what's going on?

1177
01:38:14,547 --> 01:38:18,039
The police think
that I did some bad things.

1178
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:21,746
- You are the police.
- Not anymore.

1179
01:38:23,222 --> 01:38:24,780
Why do they think you did that?

1180
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:25,983
Because...

1181
01:38:27,393 --> 01:38:29,327
Because somebody...

1182
01:38:30,296 --> 01:38:31,763
...made it look like I did.

1183
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:34,563
I once saw that on a show.

1184
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:46,478
I want to talk to you about something.

1185
01:38:48,114 --> 01:38:49,376
About your dad.

1186
01:38:53,586 --> 01:38:55,213
He's not asleep, is he?

1187
01:38:59,158 --> 01:39:00,887
No, son. He's not asleep.

1188
01:39:03,162 --> 01:39:04,459
Did it hurt?

1189
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:09,398
I don't think so.

1190
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:13,761
- Do you think he's gonna go to heaven?
- Yes.

1191
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:15,700
Yes, I do.

1192
01:39:16,275 --> 01:39:18,641
Anybody deserves to go to heaven,
it's your dad.

1193
01:39:22,215 --> 01:39:23,705
I think so, too.

1194
01:39:55,047 --> 01:39:56,844
We got no place else to go.

1195
01:39:57,083 --> 01:39:58,744
This is my nephew, Sam.

1196
01:40:00,686 --> 01:40:02,551
Okay. Hi, Sam.

1197
01:40:02,722 --> 01:40:04,553
Nice to meet you. I'm Gretta.

1198
01:40:07,593 --> 01:40:09,254
You're in your pajamas.

1199
01:40:09,695 --> 01:40:12,755
I wasn't expecting company,
but I'm glad you're here.

1200
01:40:15,835 --> 01:40:19,862
Why don't you go over there
by the fireplace and get warm.

1201
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,535
Azazel wrote on his chest.

1202
01:40:22,675 --> 01:40:23,869
Unless I do something...

1203
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:28,273
I'll get you a coffee.

1204
01:40:28,347 --> 01:40:29,405
Thank you.

1205
01:41:32,678 --> 01:41:35,408
I think I got my mind
around this thing now, but let me...

1206
01:41:35,615 --> 01:41:37,606
...let me run this by you, okay?

1207
01:41:38,651 --> 01:41:40,676
After the host body dies...

1208
01:41:41,554 --> 01:41:45,012
...the demon can survive
for one breath or 500 cubits, right?

1209
01:41:45,191 --> 01:41:46,522
At the same time...

1210
01:41:46,592 --> 01:41:50,426
...Azazel says to me
when he moves as spirit no man can resist.

1211
01:41:50,496 --> 01:41:54,125
So someone he can't get into by touch,
he can still get into by spirit.

1212
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:58,102
Because if, when he's in spirit form...

1213
01:41:58,671 --> 01:42:02,869
...he's fighting for his life,
he's going to be that much more powerful.

1214
01:42:06,545 --> 01:42:08,706
Please tell me what you're going to do.

1215
01:42:09,048 --> 01:42:10,538
<i>Whatever I do...</i>

1216
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:15,216
<i>... I have to make sure</i>
<i>that you and Sam are safe.</i>

1217
01:42:16,455 --> 01:42:18,150
<i>Will you take him somewhere...</i>

1218
01:42:18,224 --> 01:42:19,885
<i>... nobody knows about?</i>

1219
01:42:20,793 --> 01:42:21,953
<i>Even me.</i>

1220
01:42:37,309 --> 01:42:38,571
Listen...

1221
01:42:41,414 --> 01:42:42,506
I gotta go.

1222
01:42:43,916 --> 01:42:46,407
You're gonna stay with Gretta for a while.

1223
01:42:46,752 --> 01:42:48,481
Maybe for a long while.

1224
01:42:50,256 --> 01:42:52,247
And I want you to remember this:

1225
01:42:52,324 --> 01:42:54,588
Whatever people say about me...

1226
01:42:56,262 --> 01:42:57,991
...or whatever I do...

1227
01:42:59,432 --> 01:43:02,697
...I just want you to remember
that I'm doing it for you.

1228
01:43:03,602 --> 01:43:05,229
Because I love you.

1229
01:43:06,272 --> 01:43:07,603
You understand?

1230
01:43:12,111 --> 01:43:14,011
I'm gonna go back to sleep...

1231
01:43:14,947 --> 01:43:19,247
...and when I wake up
everything is gonna be just the way it was.

1232
01:43:55,755 --> 01:43:56,813
Thank you.

1233
01:43:59,391 --> 01:44:00,949
You know what this means, right?

1234
01:44:03,062 --> 01:44:04,324
I'm ready.

1235
01:44:43,736 --> 01:44:45,328
<i>Hey, Jonesy, how you doing?</i>

1236
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:46,462
<i>Look, I'm worried, man.</i>

1237
01:44:47,673 --> 01:44:49,436
What are you gonna do?

1238
01:44:49,875 --> 01:44:51,706
I'm going nowhere.

1239
01:44:52,444 --> 01:44:54,435
I'm taking a long drive...

1240
01:44:55,447 --> 01:44:56,880
...where nobody will find me...

1241
01:44:57,583 --> 01:45:00,211
<i>... and sit by the water and think.</i>

1242
01:45:00,786 --> 01:45:02,617
<i>I gotta ask you something.</i>

1243
01:45:02,988 --> 01:45:04,353
<i>Yeah, shoot.</i>

1244
01:45:04,824 --> 01:45:06,815
<i>We've been partners a long time.</i>

1245
01:45:07,059 --> 01:45:09,823
<i>Twelve plus, Jonesy. Twelve plus.</i>

1246
01:45:10,462 --> 01:45:13,556
<i>So is there anything you gotta tell me?</i>

1247
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,065
<i>Yeah, remember what we were</i>
<i>talking about the other night?</i>

1248
01:45:18,971 --> 01:45:20,802
<i>When the moment comes...</i>

1249
01:45:21,273 --> 01:45:22,638
<i>... you know it.</i>

1250
01:45:24,577 --> 01:45:25,976
<i>Be careful, okay?</i>

1251
01:45:26,745 --> 01:45:28,303
<i>I'll see you, partner.</i>

1252
01:45:28,647 --> 01:45:29,909
<i>Yeah, you, too.</i>

1253
01:45:30,816 --> 01:45:32,010
<i>Be good.</i>

1254
01:46:02,548 --> 01:46:05,108
<i>You're probably wondering:</i>
<i>What am I doing?</i>

1255
01:46:06,552 --> 01:46:09,020
<i>This is where things get a little tricky.</i>

1256
01:46:09,455 --> 01:46:11,446
<i>It's just him and me now.</i>

1257
01:46:12,024 --> 01:46:14,117
<i>Hobbes versus Azazel.</i>

1258
01:46:16,528 --> 01:46:18,018
<i>I thought I had him.</i>

1259
01:46:18,464 --> 01:46:20,364
<i>But he thought he had me, too.</i>

1260
01:48:15,781 --> 01:48:17,078
Come on out.

1261
01:48:17,683 --> 01:48:19,480
I know you're here.

1262
01:48:20,819 --> 01:48:22,411
I knew you'd come.

1263
01:48:33,665 --> 01:48:35,565
Haven't you done enough?

1264
01:48:39,038 --> 01:48:41,268
You made me kill an innocent man. You...

1265
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:46,607
...murdered my brother!

1266
01:48:47,713 --> 01:48:49,908
Come out, you son of a bitch!

1267
01:48:50,783 --> 01:48:53,047
How much more fun can you have!

1268
01:48:57,589 --> 01:48:59,454
Jesus, Hobbes.

1269
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:03,620
What are you talking about?

1270
01:49:05,864 --> 01:49:07,729
I didn't do any of that.

1271
01:49:09,268 --> 01:49:13,364
Me, I'm the poor <i>schmo</i>
they sent up here to bring you in.

1272
01:49:15,607 --> 01:49:17,234
So it's you now.

1273
01:49:17,576 --> 01:49:18,770
It's me.

1274
01:49:18,911 --> 01:49:20,811
Who'd you expect it'd be?

1275
01:49:22,014 --> 01:49:23,948
Now drop your gun, Hobbes.

1276
01:49:24,716 --> 01:49:26,547
I know you got one.

1277
01:49:27,152 --> 01:49:28,414
Or what?

1278
01:49:28,954 --> 01:49:30,285
You'll shoot me?

1279
01:49:31,824 --> 01:49:33,519
Where is the fun in that?

1280
01:49:34,059 --> 01:49:35,390
Fuck you, huh?

1281
01:49:35,961 --> 01:49:37,895
You're making me do this.

1282
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:40,594
Now drop the goddamn gun.

1283
01:49:40,732 --> 01:49:42,393
Do what he says, Hobbes.

1284
01:49:47,239 --> 01:49:48,433
Jonesy.

1285
01:50:00,652 --> 01:50:02,643
Who else is out here, huh?

1286
01:50:02,754 --> 01:50:04,415
Lou?! Tiff, come on out!

1287
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:06,287
No, it's just the two of us.

1288
01:50:09,928 --> 01:50:11,259
The gun, Hobbes.

1289
01:50:37,890 --> 01:50:40,051
Jonesy, you know I didn't do this.

1290
01:50:40,893 --> 01:50:43,157
You know I didn't do any of it.

1291
01:50:43,495 --> 01:50:44,962
I know that, Hobbes.

1292
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:48,659
We both want to believe you,
but we gotta bring you in.

1293
01:51:01,713 --> 01:51:03,044
Stan...

1294
01:51:04,116 --> 01:51:05,583
I don't know if I can do this.

1295
01:51:07,452 --> 01:51:09,283
What the fuck you talking...?

1296
01:51:09,955 --> 01:51:12,480
Say Hobbes disappears into the woods...

1297
01:51:13,025 --> 01:51:16,756
We drive his car into the lake.
End of story. What's wrong with that?

1298
01:51:16,828 --> 01:51:19,888
We bring the son of a bitch in.
That's why we're up here.

1299
01:51:19,965 --> 01:51:21,296
He did it, fine.

1300
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,265
He didn't do it, even better.

1301
01:51:23,402 --> 01:51:27,270
But it's not our job to decide.
Now drop the goddamn gun.

1302
01:51:31,743 --> 01:51:33,074
Jonesy.

1303
01:51:35,547 --> 01:51:37,378
Put the goddamn gun down.

1304
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:48,853
Okay.

1305
01:52:04,643 --> 01:52:05,735
Thank you.

1306
01:52:11,183 --> 01:52:12,582
I'm sorry, Stan.

1307
01:52:13,218 --> 01:52:16,984
Been on the force so many years you think
you've seen it all, but you haven't.

1308
01:52:17,055 --> 01:52:18,920
Life always gives you one more surprise.

1309
01:52:18,991 --> 01:52:20,185
One more.

1310
01:52:26,665 --> 01:52:28,360
Sometimes it's a big one.

1311
01:52:29,368 --> 01:52:30,392
Azazel.

1312
01:52:31,670 --> 01:52:33,365
I'm your partner, man.

1313
01:52:33,705 --> 01:52:35,104
You're free. Run.

1314
01:52:36,942 --> 01:52:38,239
Keep thinking, Hobbes.

1315
01:52:43,682 --> 01:52:45,149
How about that?!

1316
01:52:46,318 --> 01:52:48,786
Jonesy's fucked. He just killed his boss.

1317
01:52:51,189 --> 01:52:52,747
Jonesy's fucked!

1318
01:52:52,891 --> 01:52:54,290
You're fucked!

1319
01:52:54,693 --> 01:52:56,160
One at a time, huh?!

1320
01:52:56,628 --> 01:52:58,789
That's how we do it. One by one.

1321
01:53:00,332 --> 01:53:02,527
OIly-olly-oxen-free!

1322
01:53:04,469 --> 01:53:06,232
"Time

1323
01:53:07,773 --> 01:53:10,003
"Is on my side

1324
01:53:10,509 --> 01:53:12,443
"Yes, it is

1325
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:14,606
"Time

1326
01:53:15,714 --> 01:53:17,181
"Is on my side"

1327
01:53:17,282 --> 01:53:19,113
You like the Stones, Hobbes?

1328
01:53:19,551 --> 01:53:22,543
I bet you didn't, you big Monkee fan pussy.

1329
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:29,357
Time's up!

1330
01:53:30,862 --> 01:53:32,591
See the deal?!

1331
01:53:33,665 --> 01:53:35,462
If I kill you...

1332
01:53:37,903 --> 01:53:39,598
...it's just the final...

1333
01:53:39,905 --> 01:53:41,566
...pathetic chapter...

1334
01:53:42,007 --> 01:53:44,407
...in the life of a disgraced hero.

1335
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:48,640
Just one more piece of shit human scum.

1336
01:53:50,716 --> 01:53:51,978
But...

1337
01:53:52,084 --> 01:53:53,449
...turn it around.

1338
01:53:55,053 --> 01:53:56,418
If I die...

1339
01:54:01,093 --> 01:54:02,754
...I enter you...

1340
01:54:03,729 --> 01:54:05,959
...put 20 more murders on your tab...

1341
01:54:06,832 --> 01:54:08,424
...before you go down.

1342
01:54:10,535 --> 01:54:12,833
Maybe your nephew or that...

1343
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:16,607
...chippy you were talking to.

1344
01:54:18,377 --> 01:54:20,937
How do you want to do this?
I die, you die?

1345
01:54:21,113 --> 01:54:23,104
What's maximum fun? Can you guess...

1346
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:27,081
...what maximum fun is?

1347
01:54:28,387 --> 01:54:29,752
Sure you can.

1348
01:54:31,656 --> 01:54:33,783
Now that I've played you
from the outside...

1349
01:54:34,226 --> 01:54:36,091
...maximum fun is...

1350
01:54:36,661 --> 01:54:38,458
...I become you.

1351
01:55:11,663 --> 01:55:14,564
You got me, Hobbes. You got me good.

1352
01:55:16,735 --> 01:55:18,566
But I gotta ask you something.

1353
01:55:19,438 --> 01:55:21,668
You wouldn't let me kill myself.
Why is that?

1354
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,673
Because I need more time.

1355
01:55:24,109 --> 01:55:25,701
Time for what, asshole?

1356
01:55:27,779 --> 01:55:30,145
Five hundred cubits.
That's a long way, Azazel.

1357
01:55:31,149 --> 01:55:33,049
If Jonesy dies too fast...

1358
01:55:33,185 --> 01:55:35,016
...as powerful as you are...

1359
01:55:36,288 --> 01:55:38,153
...I might never get away from you.

1360
01:55:38,323 --> 01:55:40,348
Oh, he's catching on.

1361
01:55:41,293 --> 01:55:43,591
What? You think you're going to win?

1362
01:55:44,930 --> 01:55:46,227
God willing.

1363
01:55:53,004 --> 01:55:54,528
You never know.

1364
01:56:01,713 --> 01:56:03,476
Let me ask you something.

1365
01:56:08,453 --> 01:56:10,148
Why do you think...

1366
01:56:11,056 --> 01:56:12,489
...Milano...

1367
01:56:12,991 --> 01:56:14,982
...came all the way out here...

1368
01:56:15,393 --> 01:56:16,860
...in the middle of nowhere?

1369
01:56:16,928 --> 01:56:18,896
To die, the little chickenshit.

1370
01:56:20,632 --> 01:56:21,963
I don't think so.

1371
01:56:23,735 --> 01:56:25,896
I think that he wanted to do...

1372
01:56:26,505 --> 01:56:28,200
...what I'm going to do.

1373
01:56:28,707 --> 01:56:31,540
- Only he couldn't pull it off.
- Pull what off?

1374
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:33,302
Oh, come on, Azazel.

1375
01:56:34,713 --> 01:56:36,510
Open your eyes.

1376
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:39,908
Look around sometime.

1377
01:56:40,819 --> 01:56:43,720
Here we are, in this beautiful place...

1378
01:56:44,756 --> 01:56:47,725
...not another human being
around for miles.

1379
01:56:48,527 --> 01:56:50,017
It's just you and me.

1380
01:56:58,703 --> 01:57:01,263
What is this? You don't smoke anymore.

1381
01:57:06,845 --> 01:57:08,437
That's right. I don't.

1382
01:57:09,748 --> 01:57:10,942
You know why?

1383
01:57:14,119 --> 01:57:15,780
Because cigarettes kill.

1384
01:57:18,456 --> 01:57:20,856
Especially cigarettes laced with poison.

1385
01:57:23,461 --> 01:57:24,621
Bullshit.

1386
01:57:26,565 --> 01:57:29,295
Same poison that you used
to kill my brother.

1387
01:57:33,505 --> 01:57:34,699
Fuck you.

1388
01:57:36,074 --> 01:57:37,769
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1389
01:57:38,209 --> 01:57:39,574
Isn't it so sweet?

1390
01:57:40,478 --> 01:57:42,139
We die together...

1391
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:43,870
...just you and me.

1392
01:57:51,289 --> 01:57:52,916
"Time

1393
01:57:54,893 --> 01:57:56,383
"Is on my side

1394
01:57:59,264 --> 01:58:00,697
"Yes, it is"

1395
01:58:00,899 --> 01:58:02,730
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1396
01:58:12,677 --> 01:58:14,042
I'm sorry, Jonesy.

1397
01:58:27,759 --> 01:58:28,919
I'm sorry.

1398
01:59:33,391 --> 01:59:36,258
<i>So, like I said at the start...</i>

1399
01:59:36,561 --> 01:59:37,926
<i>... I was beaten...</i>

1400
01:59:38,096 --> 01:59:40,724
<i>... outsmarted, poisoned...</i>

1401
01:59:40,832 --> 01:59:44,268
<i>... by Detective John Hobbes.</i>

1402
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:59,346
<i>Can you imagine what it feels like</i>
<i>to be alive for thousands of years...</i>

1403
01:59:59,617 --> 02:00:02,450
<i>... and realize you're actually going to die...</i>

1404
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:07,182
<i>... because some self-righteous cop decided</i>
<i>he was going to save the fucking world?</i>

1405
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:11,859
<i>Yes, a demon can die...</i>

1406
02:00:12,363 --> 02:00:15,730
<i>... and Hobbes figured out</i>
<i>how to beat me at my own game.</i>

1407
02:00:16,134 --> 02:00:17,396
<i>So what?</i>

1408
02:00:18,970 --> 02:00:21,302
<i>The war isn't over, I promise you.</i>

1409
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:24,032
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

1410
02:00:42,393 --> 02:00:44,486
<i>You forgot something, didn't you?</i>

1411
02:00:46,531 --> 02:00:49,022
<i>At the beginning I said</i>
<i>I was going to tell you...</i>

1412
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:52,228
<i>... about the time I almost died.</i>

1413
02:00:59,477 --> 02:01:01,001
<i>See you around.</i>
