our wild mutations

aah aah uhh.

22
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:32,638
he survived

23
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:35,540
now if his genes
check out as normal,

we're home free,
fellas.

i--i feel kind of funny.

27
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:46,082
he's mutating !

get out of the way !

snap out of it,
michelangelo.

00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,299
i don't want
to have to hurt you.

31
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:13,272
sorry,
michelangelo,

32
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:14,440
but you asked
for it.

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,980
come on, michelangelo,
snap out of it.

34
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,784
just our luck,
a swiss army mutant.

35
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,430
whoa.

36
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:45,332
ah, well,
that didn't work.

37
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,333
it's a good thing

38
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,234
we ran a virtual
reality simulation

39
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,836
on that demutation ray

40
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,871
before we tried it
on ourselves.

41
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,406
look on
the bright side, guys.

42
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,506
we can make a bundle

43
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,108
selling that
as a video game.

44
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,342
can i play it again ?

45
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,211
this is no joke,
raphael.

46
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,745
we've got
to find a way

47
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:02,013
to stabilize
our mutations.

48
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,081
stormy seas
grow calm

49
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:06,284
when the wind
stops blowing.

50
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:09,452
calm you mind and you
will find the answer.

51
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,421
ahh, all right.

52
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:13,455
let's start over
with the calculations.

53
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:30,371
lord dregg,

54
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:32,604
sensors indicate
that vortex crystals

55
00:03:32,605 --> 00:03:34,106
have been activated

56
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:35,842
within this quadrant
of the galaxy.

57
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:39,277
the readings are
coming from earth !

58
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:42,247
of course.
those mutant turtles

59
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:45,149
must've figured out that
the crystal has the power

60
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,484
to stabilize
their mutations.

61
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:50,121
but the readings
are so low, lord dregg.

62
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:52,756
they must only have
a few fragments.

63
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:54,457
with even the tiniest piece,

64
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,260
i can genetically recreate
another crystal.

65
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:01,296
then i can complete
the vortex transporter.

66
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:02,931
where's mung ?

67
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:06,100
here, your lordship.

68
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,436
when will
the dreggnaught be ready ?

69
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:11,538
oh, it is ready now,
your lordship.

70
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:14,474
but, dregg, even if
we return to earth,

71
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:16,508
it will take months
to reconstruct

72
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:18,143
the vortex transporter.

73
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:20,246
may it please you,
sire...

74
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:23,681
with this you can build
whatever you dream

75
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:25,483
in just hours.

76
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:26,851
that's impossible.

77
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:28,018
you are looking at

78
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,756
over a million
computerized microbots.

79
00:04:32,757 --> 00:04:35,258
mung, how would you
like to leave

80
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:39,061
this slimy planet and
be my second in command ?

81
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,063
but i am your
second in command !

82
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:43,532
no one but dregg
is superior

83
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,400
to the high-tech.

84
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:56,008
i'm sending you on
a mission, high-tech.

85
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:58,444
you'll orbit the galaxy
like a space probe

86
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:04,916
and return with untold data
in say, 2,000 light years.

87
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:07,684
high-tech: lord dregg !

88
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:11,756
no !

89
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:14,657
i will not
disappoint you,

90
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:16,326
my lord.

91
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:24,099
i've adjusted the crystal
oscillation frequency

92
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,066
to automatically match
your genetic codes.

93
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,169
it should work
this time.

94
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,471
all right, let's run
another v. r. test.

95
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:40,680
whoa, dudes, i feel like
totally perfectimundo,

96
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:43,149
even though i am
a virtual turtle.

97
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,348
we did it.

98
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,684
now all
i've got to do

99
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:47,685
is run a simulation
on my genetic code.

100
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:52,389
carter: commencing
simulation.

101
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,794
no, it didn't work.
the vortex crystal

102
00:05:57,795 --> 00:06:00,463
has no effect on
my genetic code.

103
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:02,965
the same notes
played another way

104
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:05,300
make
beautiful music.

105
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,036
you must find your
own song, carter.

106
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,642
scanners have located

107
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:19,012
the vortex crystal
emissions, lord dregg.

108
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:21,348
i trust your microbots
will be able

109
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:23,349
to accomplish the task.

110
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,651
it will take only one

111
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,486
to track down
the vortex crystal.

112
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:32,389
a microrocket.
brilliant.

113
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:42,631
vital signs
are holding steady.

114
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,839
crystal fragments
are charged and ready.

115
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,606
stabilizing raphael's
genetic code.

116
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:58,578
excuse me.

117
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,984
stabilizing donatello.

118
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,123
aah.

119
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:12,056
hmm.

120
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,562
stabilizing michelangelo.

121
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,375
stabilizing leonardo.

122
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:49,288
ah, that was easy.

123
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:51,122
yeah, but how
can we be sure

124
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,791
we're really
back to normal ?

125
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:54,292
leonardo's
got a point.

126
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:56,393
we need to test
your genetic stability.

127
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,962
yeah, we usually
mutate under stress.

128
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:01,131
too bad we don't have
that alien sleazeball dregg

129
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,464
to deal with.

130
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,133
i wouldn't be
so hasty

131
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,567
in your assumption,
raphael.

132
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,203
but in the meantime,

133
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:09,570
i suggest you try
some sparring.

134
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,738
hyah !

135
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:24,450
oh, i think we're...
totally back to normal.

136
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:28,586
i think
i'm totally... wasted.

137
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:35,126
it appears you are back
to your stable form.

138
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:39,596
hey, carter,
where are you going ?

139
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:41,965
well, i came here
to learn from splinter,

140
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,367
and i'm grateful for
all you've taught me,

141
00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:47,102
but i think i should
go back to college.

142
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,871
maybe if i continue
my studies

143
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:51,073
in biochemistry,
i can discover a way

144
00:08:51,074 --> 00:08:52,441
to change myself
back to normal.

145
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:55,677
don't be silly.
we'll find a way

146
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:57,245
to stabilize
your mutations.

147
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,780
yeah, and besides, we've
gotten used to having

148
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:01,615
a non-turtle
in the family.

149
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:04,417
thanks, guys,
but i've made up my mind.

150
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,685
and you're sure

151
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,153
we can't change
your mind, carter ?

152
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:11,057
well, then we're
sure gonna miss you.

153
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:12,157
huh ?

154
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:17,828
whoa !

155
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,701
come on, leonardo.
first, you rag on me

156
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:27,603
for goofing off
at the v. r. simulator,

157
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:30,040
now you're doing it.
hey !

158
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,106
whoa !

159
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:33,107
ohh !

160
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:35,043
that's no simulation.

161
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:37,077
leonardo's mutated !

162
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,280
no kidding.

163
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:43,249
we've got to stop him

164
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,051
before he trashes
the whole lair.

165
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,819
take it easy, dude.

166
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,688
we're your buds.

167
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,722
yeow !

168
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,061
uhh.

169
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:58,762
talk about
a terrible time

170
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:00,731
not to have our
super mutation powers.

171
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:01,932
donatello:
he's getting away !

172
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:06,569
we'll catch him
in the van.

173
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,137
raphael:
carter, let's roll.

174
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:09,638
carter:
leonardo's mutation

175
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,307
was caused by
a power drop.

176
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:12,875
i should've seen it.

177
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:14,776
hey, let's worry about
whose fault it is

178
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:16,711
after we get him
under control.

179
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:19,047
no. i've got to find out
what went wrong.

180
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:20,514
you go on without me.

181
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:31,257
the microbot has returned,
lord dregg.

182
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:38,130
mung: and it's got
the crystal fragment.

183
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:39,663
excellent.

184
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:45,402
once the genetic cloning
of the crystal is complete,

185
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:49,339
it will power
my vortex transporter.

186
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,741
capable of
transporting anything

187
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:55,478
from one end of
the universe to the other.

188
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:59,180
oh, just what you need
to conquer the earth.

189
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:04,185
exactly. and eliminate those
meddlesome turtles as well.

190
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:06,086
prepare
the remaining microbots.

191
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:07,721
yes, lord dregg.

192
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:17,028
cab driver: yeah, sure
there's plenty of kooks

193
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:19,130
and crazies, lady.
but on the whole,

194
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:20,799
i think the city's
getting better.

195
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:24,635
uh, like
i was saying,

196
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:27,771
the city is no kind
of place to live !

197
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,439
look, there he is !

198
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:35,277
i sure hope our insurance
covers mutant damage.

199
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,781
easy, leonardo.

200
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,817
now, we're not gonna
hurt you.

201
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:45,319
he's definitely having
a bad hair day.

202
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:56,361
michelangelo: oh, great,
just what we needed,

203
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:57,896
more bad press.

204
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,599
we've got to get leonardo
out of here and fast.

205
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,465
get ready, guys.

206
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:06,437
hey, leonardo, catch !

207
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:14,143
get the van, dudes !

208
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:20,948
yeow !

209
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:21,949
whoa ow !

210
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,519
whoa ow !

211
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,321
raphael, call april

212
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:30,891
and see if she can keep
us off the 11:00 news.

213
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:33,192
oh, sure, give me
the impossible job.

214
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:36,495
april,
it's raphael.

215
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:37,363
what's up ?

216
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:39,364
leonardo's mutated
out of control.

217
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:40,799
he's doing
a king kong routine

218
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,301
for the local news.

219
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:44,203
can you pull the plug
on the story ?

220
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:45,937
hmm, let's see.

221
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:49,006
oh, sorry, guys.
it's a live feed.

222
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,341
raphael: in that case,
how about calling

223
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:51,775
the department of
animal regulation ?

224
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:05,186
he's headed
toward downtown.

225
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:07,288
we might be able to
catch him in the van.

226
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:13,893
lord dregg,
look at this.

227
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,762
newscaster: and then
the mutated creature,

228
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:18,731
believed to be one of
the infamous ninja turtles,

229
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,399
destroyed a gas station

230
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,401
before being helped
to escape

231
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,268
by his turtle accomplices.

232
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:27,005
so, one of the turtles
has mutated

233
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,806
into an even more
degenerate creature.

234
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:32,308
this will make my plans
to conquer the earth

235
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:35,411
and destroy those
turtles even easier.

236
00:13:35,412 --> 00:13:38,080
mung, prepare
the shuttle.

237
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:39,882
yes, lord dregg.

238
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:57,030
eh, first it's roaches,
now it's ants.

239
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:58,665
well, i'll fix 'em.

240
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:03,268
huh ?

241
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:09,073
whoa !

242
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,331
he's got to be
around here somewhere.

243
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:39,265
hold it.
what ?

244
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,633
shh.
what's wrong ?

245
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:43,168
ohh.

246
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:08,990
oh, no.
it's dregg !

247
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,326
and he's got some
seriously ugly new buds !

248
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:15,595
oh, you say that as if
you're not glad to see me.

249
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,265
turtles: look out !

250
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:32,844
atta boy, leonardo !

251
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,811
protect your
fellow turtles !

252
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,581
mung, get us
out of here.

253
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:44,686
way to go, dude !
give me three !

254
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:46,355
oh !

255
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:50,024
whoa.

256
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:53,061
he should definitely
cut down on his sugar.

257
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:58,532
huh. there must be
an answer here somewhere.

258
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,266
can i get you
anything else, hon ?

259
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,367
wait a minute.

260
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:03,569
it looks like someone
or something

261
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,171
stole a piece
of the crystal.

262
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,205
maybe it wasn't
my fault after all.

263
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,543
aah !
whoa !

264
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:17,548
aah ! oh !

265
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:19,516
aah !

266
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:24,686
look out !

267
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,996
quick ! tie him up !

268
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,067
sorry
i ducked out on you,

269
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,903
but i finally figured out
what went wrong.

270
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,772
you can tell us about it
on the way back to the lair.

271
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,077
oh, great.

272
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,079
well, can you tell me

273
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,447
when the power's going
to come back on ?

274
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,583
what do you mean,
no one knows what's wrong ?

275
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,885
ok. thanks.

276
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:05,354
the power went out
at the hydroelectric dam,

277
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:07,489
but they haven't been able
to contact anyone there.

278
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,558
sounds like that's
where the problem is.

279
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,275
what the heck
is going on here ?

280
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:54,429
whatever's going on,

281
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,899
i bet i'll find the answer
at the end of these cables.

282
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,440
incredible. dregg !

283
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:12,143
power connections
are complete.

284
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:15,214
soon, when the vortex
transporter is complete,

285
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:19,149
i shall transport something
very special to earth.

286
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,653
something which will assure
my conquest of the planet,

287
00:18:22,654 --> 00:18:27,023
as well as the destruction
of those meddling reptiles.

288
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,691
i've got to warn
the guys.

289
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,160
guys, it's april.
it's an emergency.

290
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:33,295
what's wrong ?

291
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,797
it's dregg. he's back.

292
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:37,765
and he's building
some kind of a transporter

293
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,801
in the old atlantic
steel mill.

294
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:41,335
he's got some other
cronies with him

295
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,336
and thousands of little...

296
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:45,038
aaa--mmph.

297
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,707
she's in trouble,
dudes !

298
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,709
yeah, and so is
the rest of the world

299
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,342
if dregg's up to
his usual stuff.

300
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:52,411
looks like leonardo
will have to wait.

301
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,517
it's done.

302
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:02,686
and you, my fine
young specimen,

303
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:04,889
shall be
its first occupant.

304
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,024
no ! let me go !

305
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:15,464
i hope you enjoy
your trip...

306
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,165
to the other end
of the universe.

307
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,871
oh, the turtles !

308
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:27,140
that's teenage mutant
ninja turtles to you, pal !

309
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:28,741
destroy them !

310
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,416
carter ! whoa !

311
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:53,595
michelangelo,
give me a fastball.

312
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:55,130
low and outside, dude.

313
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:01,636
got them.

314
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:04,638
yeah, but who's
gonna get him ?!

315
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,808
whoa !
look out !

316
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,045
oh !

317
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,314
whoa !
oh !

318
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:15,315
cover me !

319
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:18,383
i'm gonna cut this dummy
down to size.

320
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,487
i got you covered,
dude. go for it !

321
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,393
timber !

322
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,993
have a nice trip !

323
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:33,896
see you
next fall.

324
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:35,698
whoa !
oh !

325
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:48,142
place these fools
on the transporter

326
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:49,008
with the girl.

327
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:58,551
hey, where are you
sending us ?

328
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:01,052
the center of the sun.

329
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:04,522
oh, and me without my number
50 million sun block.

330
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:10,928
oh !

331
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:17,966
way to go, bud !

332
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,935
cut us loose !

333
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:21,502
thanks.

334
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:24,539
get back.

335
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:35,247
dregg's
getting away !

336
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:41,853
what are you doing ?

337
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,154
computer:
vortex crystal overload.

338
00:21:43,155 --> 00:21:45,155
meltdown in 10 seconds.

339
00:21:45,156 --> 00:21:47,091
i'm making sure
he never comes back.

340
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:48,993
let's get out of here !

341
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:02,504
forgive me,
lord dregg.

342
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:05,005
i have failed you.

343
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:06,507
on the contrary.

344
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:09,009
everything went just
as i intended.

345
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,410
ha ha ha ha !

346
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:13,012
this piece of mutated
turtle shell

347
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:17,516
will help me gain
unimaginable power.

348
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:21,020
but--but what about
the vortex transporter ?

349
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:23,488
how can you
build another ?

350
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:27,025
easily. i kept
a spare piece of crystal

351
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,659
and one microbot.

352
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,028
oh, of course !

353
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:34,531
one can build two...

354
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:36,532
two can build four...

355
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:39,769
and soon
i'll have billions !

356
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,038
then i'll build another
vortex transporter,

357
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,275
and the earth
will be mine !

358
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:50,645
hey, i thought
you were leaving, carter.

359
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,546
well, i've decided
to stick around

360
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:55,148
until we find the antidote
to leonardo's mutation.

361
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:57,150
hey, that's great news,
'cause we're sure

362
00:22:57,151 --> 00:23:00,119
gonna need major help
taming this beast.
