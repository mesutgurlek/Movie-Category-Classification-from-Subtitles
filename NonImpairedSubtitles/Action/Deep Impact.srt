00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:30,326
I came to Washington
with him.

167
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:33,963
I moved here because I was
dedicated to his career.

168
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:35,931
I trusted the man...

169
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,811
and then he fucked me.

170
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,168
He what?

171
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:40,892
No, I didn't
have sex with him.

172
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,807
I should say / didn't
have sex with him,

173
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,088
but somebody sure did.

174
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,483
It was about to come out,
so he resigned.

175
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:50,532
But because I was hired from
outside the government pool,

176
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:52,730
I don't get conveyed
to the next secretary,

177
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:54,088
so now I'm out a job...

178
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:57,769
Because he couldn't
keep his hands off women.

179
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,766
Do you have proof?

180
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:03,924
He thinks he was
being so clever.

181
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:06,972
He had a private phone line
installed in his office.

182
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:08,487
Nobody else could answer it.

183
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:10,485
I picked it up once.

184
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:13,372
Said hello,
and it's nobody home.

185
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,206
It rings, he shuts the door.

186
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:17,888
Why not hang a sign?

187
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:19,373
Do you have a name?

188
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:21,206
This is what I get

189
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:22,773
for talking to the press.

190
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,731
I'm selling my soul
right now.

191
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,374
I can feel it.
I can feel it.

192
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,127
I name a name and get
someone into trouble.

193
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,169
So you do have a name.

194
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:32,926
Just a first name.

195
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:34,493
Oh, my God.
I'm going to say it.

196
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:36,246
Ellie.

197
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:39,928
Ellie. Nothing else?

198
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:42,528
I think the president
knows about it, too.

199
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,765
Overheard the secretary
talking to him about her.

200

Well, actually,

205

we're looking
for your mom.

Is she around?

My mom's sick.
She's not here.

208

Gosh, I love boats.
Are you going on a trip?

00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:43,287
Yeah.

210
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:48,494
That's exciting. Looks
like a long trip, huh?

211
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:51,247
So, listen, do you know
where you're going?

212
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,165
Rittenhouse: She's going
back to the house.

213
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:55,893
Hey, you want to stop that?

214
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,169

215
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,164

My wife is sick.
She's in the hospital.

That's why I resigned.

talk about Ellie.

Well, we know about
the secret phone lines

and the whispered calls
to the president

231

and about a secretary
of the Treasury

who's kept his entire
department in the dark

about what
he's really doing...

about a cover story
about his resignation

You want me to go on?

And you're
just gonna break it?

Good luck to you.

Personally...

243
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,570
I think it's a mistake
to run the story,

Can you understand that?

252
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:10,447
OK, Secretary of the Treasury
Alan Rittenhouse

253
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:13,521
resigns because of a mistress
named Ellie.

What an ego.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

The president
has a mistress named Ellie,

259

and Rittenhouse pretends
that he's having the affair

260

What did I tell you?

296
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,880
We'd always thought
the deadline for going public

297
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:09,721
was the publication
of the budget,

The budget comes out

I don't suppose I could convince
you to sit on this for 2 weeks.

No such thing as 2 weeks

00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:21,245

May I have
the first question?

I'm disturbed that
you didn't come

to our wedding.

367

Jason, you
promised.

368
00:21:58,089 --> 00:21:59,602
I know I promised,

369
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:01,008
but it was
a beautiful event,

370
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,238
and I missed her.

371

You should have been there.

372
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:05,560
The twins, they were
running around like mad

and throwing flowers.

374

It was wonderful,
especially Emma.

You know, the little one.
She loves you.

00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:12,843
It was beautiful.

She missed you, too.

a toast to happiness

Are we going to have
an evening or not?

that you hate me.

terrible things

00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:39,486
and is knocked
into a different orbit.

494
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:42,322
If this comet continues
on its path around the sun

495
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:44,320
and keeps
its present course,

496
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:47,560
sometime on August 16,
roughly a year from now,

497
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,844
there's a chance
that we might have impact.

498
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:54,445
So for the past 8 months,
the United States and Russia

499
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:58,602
have been building the largest
spaceship ever constructed.

500
00:27:58,689 --> 00:28:01,283
It's being built in orbit
around the Earth.

501
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:03,724
And we call it the <i>Messiah. </i>

502
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,881
Right now a team of American
astronauts and one Russian

503
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,482
are at Cape Canaveral
in Florida.

504
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:11,959
In 2 months, they will leave
on the shuttle <i>At</i>/<i>antis</i>

505
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,767
to board the <i>Messiah. </i>

506
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:17,762
This is the crew
that will stop the comet.

507
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:21,239
I'd like the world to meet
some extraordinary people.

508
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:23,559
First is Mission Commander
Oren Monash.

509
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:26,322
Commander, would you introduce
us to your team?

510
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:28,240
I'd be honoured, sir.

511
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:30,206
Pilot Andrea Baker.

512
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:31,642
Medical Officer

513
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:33,048
Gus Partenza.

514
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,723
From Russia,
nuclear specialist

515
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:37,925
Colonel Mikhail
Tulchinsky.

Mark Simon

517

Spurgeon Tanner.

518
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:45,118
Hello,
Mr President.

519
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:48,884
Captain Tanner,
you flew 6 shuttle missions.

520
00:28:48,969 --> 00:28:51,164
You were the last man to walk
on the moon, weren't you?

521
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:52,159
Yes, sir,

522
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:53,443
but Oren here
will be doing

523
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:54,723
most of the flying
on this one.

524
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:55,719
I'll just
be taking us down

525
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:57,879
to the comet's
surface.

526
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,482
Well, it's good to know
we're going to have

527
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:01,400
your kind of experience
up there, Captain.

528
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,399
Tanner:
Thank you, sir.

529
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:03,478
Godspeed to you all.

530
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:04,604
We're counting on you.

531
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,805
Thank you, sir.

532
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:09,005
Got Beijing, Rome,
Sao Paulo, Cairo, Berlin!

533
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:10,238
Does anyone know how big
the one was

534
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:11,887
that killed
all the dinosaurs?

535
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:14,119
Something majestic, mysterious,
with a fanfare for the intro

536
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:15,528
and a theme
for the longer promos.

537
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:17,281
You want it hitting
the goddam Earth?

538
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:18,643
Well, that's what he's saying.
Bring that up again.

539
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:20,321
It'll scare the shit
out of them.

540
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,286
Beck: We will not tolerate any
disruption of our way of life.

541
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:25,406
Our society will
continue as normal.

542
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:28,686
Work will go on.
You will pay your bills.

[Laughter]

There will be no hoarding.

545

There will be
no sudden profiteering.

546

all prices.

cost you yesterday...

548
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:46,437
it will cost you tomorrow.

why wasn't this announcement
made sooner?

558
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,119
Well, until we knew
we could build the rocket

559
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,270
and the comet
could be intercepted,

560
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,555
we saw no reason
to alarm the planet.

Yeah. Um...

564
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,190
Is... Is there a connection
between the comet

565
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,192
and the recall of American
troops from abroad?

566
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,952
Beck: Our fighting men
and women are coming home

567
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,519
because we felt it prudent,

568
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,113
in light of domestic
security concerns,

569
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,599
to have them available.

Although I certainly hope
we don't need to use them.

Actually, Mr President,

574
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,517
if... just one final
question, sir. Um...

575
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,037
MSNBC has learned that
Secretary Rittenhouse

576
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,553
did not leave
for the reasons

577
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,710
announced by
your administration.

578
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,677
In fact,
isn't it true, sir,

579
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,513
that not everyone
in your administration

580
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,990
is convinced that the
<i>Messiah</i> will save us?

581
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,793
Secretary Rittenhouse served
his country with full devotion.

582
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,475
He resigned
for personal reasons.

583
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,109
Now, I can promise you this,
Ms Lerner, all of you,

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,555
everyone in this room and
everyone listening to my voice,

585
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,030
that at some point
over the next 10 months,

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,910
all of us will entertain
our worst fears and concerns.

587
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,912
But I can also
promise you this.

saw the comet
in my photograph,

a special presentation

847
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,510
of MSNBC News

848
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,238
with Jenny Lerner.

849
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,953
Good evening.

850
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,712
Sometime in the next hour,

851
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,678
the <i>Messiah</i> mission will
enter its most critical phase:

852
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,557
the interception
of Wolf-Biederman

853
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,392
and the setting of
the nuclear devices

854
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,948
that will deflect it off
its collision course with Earth.

855
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,510
But first,
Captain Spurgeon Tanner

856
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,272
will have to guide
the spacecraft

857
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,635
through the blizzard
of rocks, sand, and ice

858
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,712
that make up
the comet's tail, or coma.

859
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,758
The crew will have to complete
its work before the sun rises.

Tanner, Over Intercom:
Disengaging auto now.

862
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,956
I'm eyeballs out
from here on in.

863
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,395
How come that doesn't
make me feel any better?

864
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,879
Tanner: I heard that.

865
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,359
Lights on.

866
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,873
Cameras on.

867
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,520
Tanner: On the Mississippi River
in Mark Twain's time,

868
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,033
there were riverboat pilots

869
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,951
who only knew a few miles
of the river.

870
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,632
I mean, conditions
changed so much,

871
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,312
you couldn't
know the whole trip.

872
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,550
Floods, sandbars,
fallen logs...

873
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,676
It was all a riverboat pilot
could do

874
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,639
was to know his little
piece of the puzzle.

875
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,439
So for the next few hours,
this is my ship.

876
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,711
We start our approach.

877
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,593
Jenny:
...are images from cameras

878
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,274
mounted inside the cargo bay
of the <i>Messiah. </i>

879
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,591
Now, these images are delayed
by approximately 20 seconds,

880
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,716
due to the distance
they must travel.

881
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,394
OK, you can see that the image
is breaking up a bit.

882
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,948
Uh, Houston is prepared
for this.

883
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,429
They've informed us that
due to the uncertain make-up

884
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,078
of the comet's coma,

885
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,311
they're unsure whether or not
transmission will be possible.

886
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,995
OK, now, now, it ap-appears
we're losing reception here.

887
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,350
OK, we've... we've
lost picture now.

888
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,510
But we will stay on the air.

the astronauts should

The moles are, well,
they're what they sound like.

922

They are drilling machines

in time?

932
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,531

00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,576
Partenza: OK, Fish,
team 2 at location 4.

973
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,729
Give me your hand.

974
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,654
What the hell happened?

975
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,093
I don't know.
I don't know.

976
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,329
Everything
was going great,

977
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,729
and we got jammed
up at 75 feet.

978
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,456
OK, hold up.

979
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,134
Monash: All right,
try backing it up.

980
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,255
Roger that.

981
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,379
- That's it.
- A little more.

982
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,654
Shut it down.

983
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,332
No, they always put
extra in these tanks.

984
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,376
Fish, shut it down.

985
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,729
OK.

986
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,209
Come on, you bastard!
Come on! Time!

Figured we'd better pick

better hurry, boys.

All right, it's going!
It's going!

Baker: Oh, God,
we're losing one.

1008
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,933
He's got escape velocity.
1,000 feet and climbing.

Nukes hot and ready.

1016
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,495
We lost Partenza
to explosive outgassing.

00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,452
And Monash is injured.

1018
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,933
We have to go get Gus.

1019

Tanner: There's
no time for that.

Repressurize
the cargo bay.

1021
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,579
He's going to die out there!

1022
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,013
We can still find him.
He has a beacon.

1023
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,374
I don't have time
to argue with you.

1024
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,291
Just sit down
and be quiet.

Turn on
the fuckin' locator!

1026
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,655
We've used most
of our propellant

1027
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,968
to get us out
of the coma.

1028
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,334
We can't just leave him.
We have to go back!

1029
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,899
If we go back for Gus,
we all die.

1030
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,096
We can't just
leave him in space!

1031
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,058
Sit down, Mick.
Sit down.

1032
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,289
It's OK.

1033
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,897
Jenny: The <i>Messiah</i> has safely
lifted off the comet.

1034
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,052
But sadly,
Gus Partenza has been lost.

1035
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,610
Gus Partenza, a native of
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,

1036
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,658
and graduate of
Carnegie-Mellon University,

1037
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,253
joined the NASA
Space Programme

1038
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,615
shortly after completing
his medical training

1039
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,214
at Duke University.

1040
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,337
Dr Partenza was selected
specifically for this mission,

1041
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,014
not only for his
medical expertise,

1042
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,738
but also for his dedication

1043
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,209
to the advancement
of space technology.

1044
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,455
Yeah.

1045
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,891
With the loss
of Dr Gus Partenza

1046
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,652
and with Oren Monash
injured,

1047
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:24,289
Captain Spurgeon Tanner
is now in charge of the mission.

1048
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,371
The <i>Messiah</i>
has successfully docked

1049
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,052
with the Orion-powered
boosters

1050
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,619
and is now prepared
to detonate

1051
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,419
the bombs planted
on Wolf-Biederman.

1052
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,058
The <i>Messiah</i>'<i>s</i>
exterior-mounted camera

1053
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,698
will show us the detonation,

1054
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,135
but not before being
temporarily blocked out

1055
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,778
by the nuclear blast.

1056
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:43,216
Once again, let me remind you,
there is a 20-second delay,

1057
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,450
so when the picture
comes back to us,

1058
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,531
the comet should already
have been knocked off

1059
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,848
its present course.

1060
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,090
Tanner: Prepare to remove
safeties and fire.

1061
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,779
Tulchinsky:
Safeties removed.

1062
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,730

Mr President,

1078
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:16,120
Hello, America.

1079
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:19,118
It is my unhappy duty
to report to you

1080
00:58:19,206 --> 00:58:21,322
that the <i>Messiah</i>
has failed.

1081
00:58:21,406 --> 00:58:23,715
This computer-enhanced radar
image from Houston

1082
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:25,637
shows how the detonation
succeeded,

1083
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:28,559
however, did not
destroy the comet.

1084
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:31,956
There are now 2 pieces...
one 6 miles wide,

1085
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:33,957
the other,
a mile and a half.

1086
00:58:34,046 --> 00:58:37,755
Both are still on a path
towards Earth.

1087
00:58:37,846 --> 00:58:39,962
We've lost communication with
the <i>Messiah</i> spacecraft,

1088
00:58:40,046 --> 00:58:43,516
although we continue
to track it visually.

1089
00:58:43,606 --> 00:58:45,915
We don't know
how many are alive.

1090
00:58:46,006 --> 00:58:48,839
We don't know
their condition.

1091
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:52,123
Now, we have to make
some decisions together.

1092
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:54,197
What do we do?

1093
00:58:54,286 --> 00:58:57,278
You have a choice.
We have a choice...

1094
00:58:57,366 --> 00:58:58,560
Right now.

1095
00:58:59,806 --> 00:59:01,319
Ever since the comet
was discovered,

1096
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:03,920
we've been hoping
and working for the best,

1097
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:06,804
but we've also been
planning for the worst.

1098
00:59:06,886 --> 00:59:09,798
Our strategy
has been twofold.

1099
00:59:09,886 --> 00:59:12,161
First, our strategic
missile command

1100
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:13,725
is preparing to coordinate
with the Russians

1101
00:59:13,806 --> 00:59:15,524
a massive strike
of Titan missiles

1102
00:59:15,606 --> 00:59:17,995
to intercept the comets.

1103
00:59:18,086 --> 00:59:20,919
If we can deflect
these comets enough,

1104
00:59:21,006 --> 00:59:24,919
they will bounce harmlessly
off our atmosphere

1105
00:59:25,006 --> 00:59:27,679
and head on out into space.

1106
00:59:27,766 --> 00:59:30,519
Unfortunately, the Titans
cannot be launched

1107
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:32,756
until the comets
are only a few hours away.

1108
00:59:32,846 --> 00:59:36,759
And while we are confident
the missile attack will succeed,

1109
00:59:36,846 --> 00:59:39,235
it is only prudent that we
now take cautionary steps

1110
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,920
to ensure the continuation
of our way of life,

1111
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:45,078
to guarantee that there
will be enough of us left

1112
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:46,963
to rebuild a new world

1113
00:59:47,046 --> 00:59:50,516
in the unlikely event that
the comets do strike the Earth.

1114
00:59:50,606 --> 00:59:54,724
So, in the soft limestone
of Missouri,

1115
00:59:54,806 --> 00:59:57,559
we've been preparing
a network of immense caves,

1116
00:59:57,646 --> 00:59:59,477
and they're almost finished.

1117
00:59:59,566 --> 01:00:02,126
And we can put
a million people in them.

1118
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:04,766
And that million people can
survive there, underground,

1119
01:00:04,846 --> 01:00:06,279
for 2 years,

1120
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:10,200
until the air clears
and the dust settles.

1121
01:00:10,286 --> 01:00:12,641
Now, the cave is more
than a dormitory.

1122
01:00:12,726 --> 01:00:14,796
It's our new Noah's Ark.

1123
01:00:14,886 --> 01:00:16,842
We're storing seeds
and seedlings,

1124
01:00:16,926 --> 01:00:20,441
plants, animals,
enough to start over.

1125
01:00:20,526 --> 01:00:22,005
On August 10th,
a computer

1126
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:25,362
will randomly select
800,000 Americans

1127
01:00:25,446 --> 01:00:29,200
to join the 200,000 scientists,
doctors, engineers,

1128
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:32,323
teachers, soldiers, and artists,

01:08:23,126 --> 01:08:26,198
You... This is your
only chance to survive.

1287
01:08:41,526 --> 01:08:43,164
Jenny: Across the country,

1288
01:08:43,246 --> 01:08:46,363
Iooters continue to set fire
to abandoned stores.

1289
01:08:46,446 --> 01:08:49,244
The fires have been left to burn
since many firefighters

1290
01:08:49,326 --> 01:08:51,556
have been called
to help prepare shelters.

1291
01:08:51,646 --> 01:08:54,365
Throughout Latin America's
major cities,

1292
01:08:54,446 --> 01:08:57,199
business districts have been
abandoned to looting gangs...

1293
01:09:04,846 --> 01:09:08,919
Airlifts have been ruled out
as too dangerous.

1294
01:09:09,006 --> 01:09:11,042
More street fighting
in Moscow

1295
01:09:11,126 --> 01:09:12,957
as food and fuel shortages
continue.

hopes all things,

endures all things.

1298
01:09:31,566 --> 01:09:34,638
When I was a child,
I spoke like a child,

1299
01:09:34,726 --> 01:09:36,762
I thought like a child,

1300
01:09:36,846 --> 01:09:38,802
I reasoned like a child.

1301
01:09:38,886 --> 01:09:43,357
When I became a man,
I gave up childish ways.

1302
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:45,801
For now we see
in a mirror dimly,

1303
01:09:45,886 --> 01:09:48,195
but then face to face.

1304
01:09:48,286 --> 01:09:49,924
Now I know in part,

1305
01:09:50,006 --> 01:09:52,566
then I shall
understand fully,

1306
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:55,365
even as I have been
fully understood.

1307
01:10:04,886 --> 01:10:09,038
Do you, Leo, take Sarah
to be your wife...

1308
01:10:09,126 --> 01:10:12,323
to have and to hold
from this day forward...

1309
01:10:12,406 --> 01:10:14,442
for better, for worse...

1310
01:10:14,526 --> 01:10:16,801
for richer, for poorer...

1311
01:10:16,886 --> 01:10:18,842
to love and to cherish?

1312
01:10:26,846 --> 01:10:29,679
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

[Morash Groans]

1316
01:11:45,505 --> 01:11:47,780
Here, let me
help you.

1317
01:11:47,865 --> 01:11:48,854
I'll get it.

1318
01:11:50,985 --> 01:11:54,660
Yeah.
How you feeling?

1319
01:11:54,745 --> 01:11:56,098
All right.

1320
01:11:56,185 --> 01:11:57,743
I want to tell you
something.

1321
01:11:57,825 --> 01:11:59,577
You children didn't bring
any real books to read,

1322
01:11:59,665 --> 01:12:01,064
did you know that?

1323
01:12:01,145 --> 01:12:03,534
I brought <i>Moby Dick</i>
and <i>Huck</i>/<i>eberry Finn</i>

1324
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:06,617
and Baker and Simon
had never read them.

1325
01:12:06,705 --> 01:12:09,014
Now, I'm afraid
to ask you,

1326
01:12:09,105 --> 01:12:12,063
have you ever read
Melville or Twain?

1327
01:12:12,145 --> 01:12:13,419
Hmm?

1328
01:12:13,505 --> 01:12:17,180
Hey, I'm a child
of the movies, Fish.

1329
01:12:17,265 --> 01:12:19,938
OK, I see.

1330
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:22,300
So...

1331
01:12:22,385 --> 01:12:25,058
You got a shitty deal,
Oren, you know that?

1332
01:12:25,145 --> 01:12:26,624
You really did.

1333
01:12:26,705 --> 01:12:28,058
Don't worry about me.

1334
01:12:28,145 --> 01:12:29,260
Yeah.

1335
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,654
I mean that. Really.

1336
01:12:31,745 --> 01:12:33,622
Don't worry about me.

1337
01:12:33,705 --> 01:12:36,822
My whole life I...

1338
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,175
You know how it is
for guys like us.

1339
01:12:42,265 --> 01:12:46,656
You... You and l,
we're the same.

1340
01:12:46,745 --> 01:12:48,975
What do you mean
by that?

1341
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:50,418
Gotta be the best.

1342
01:12:50,505 --> 01:12:52,541
Oh, I see.

1343
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:55,935
Be... the best.

[Sighs]

1345
01:13:07,225 --> 01:13:11,104
Sometimes I see
flashes of light...

1346
01:13:11,185 --> 01:13:15,303
You know,
like... colours.

1347
01:13:15,385 --> 01:13:16,738
Yeah.

1348
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:18,975
I fall asleep...

1349
01:13:19,065 --> 01:13:21,818
and I dream.

1350
01:13:21,905 --> 01:13:24,783
But there's a part of me
that's always awake.

1351
01:13:24,865 --> 01:13:27,982
And I can see myself
dreaming.

1352
01:13:32,305 --> 01:13:35,615
I'm seeing things
differently, Fish.

1353
01:13:35,705 --> 01:13:38,173
Well, that's good.

1354
01:13:38,265 --> 01:13:41,814
Fish...

1355
01:13:41,905 --> 01:13:44,055
why the hell do
they call you "Fish"?

1356
01:13:44,145 --> 01:13:46,978
[Laughs]
Well, I...

1357
01:13:47,065 --> 01:13:49,260
Spurgeon, sturgeon,
fish.

1358
01:13:49,345 --> 01:13:51,176
Took about 15 minutes
of my first day

1359
01:13:51,265 --> 01:13:52,744
at the Naval Academy.

1360
01:13:52,825 --> 01:13:55,100
Yeah.

1361
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:57,653
Your kids go there?

1362
01:13:57,745 --> 01:14:00,339
Yeah, they did.
They did.

1363
01:14:00,425 --> 01:14:02,620
And they're good men,
both of them.

1364
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:04,536
I don't see as much
of them as I used to

1365
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:05,944
when Mary was alive.

1366
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:08,619
You don't have to talk
about it. It's OK.

1367
01:14:08,705 --> 01:14:11,139
No, it's OK. It's OK.

1368
01:14:11,225 --> 01:14:13,181
You're a married man.
You know what it's like.

1369
01:14:13,265 --> 01:14:16,814
Every marriage has its
good years and bad years.

1370
01:14:16,905 --> 01:14:18,782
We ended on a great year.

1371
01:14:22,785 --> 01:14:25,219
Yeah.

1372
01:14:25,305 --> 01:14:26,704
Anyway,
let's get started.

1373
01:14:28,785 --> 01:14:30,457

"Call me Ishmael.

Several years ago, never
mind how long precisely,

01:14:38,825 --> 01:14:41,623

no money in my purse...

about the mouth...

whenever I find myself...

01:14:49,105 --> 01:14:50,936
...knocking
people's hats off,

1382
01:14:51,025 --> 01:14:53,334
then I account it
high time

1383
01:14:53,425 --> 01:14:56,098
to get to sea
as soon as I can."

1384
01:15:10,465 --> 01:15:11,818
Listen up!

1385
01:15:11,905 --> 01:15:13,099
Hold it right there!

1386
01:15:13,185 --> 01:15:14,061
- Biederman?
- That's us.

Yeah. Got them
right here.

This is my wife Sarah.

Let's go!

Sir! Could you check
it one more time?

1409

I put you on the list.
They said you're on the list.

with you!

you need to go.

No. I have to stay
with you.

1418
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,343
I'm not going anywhere
without you!

1419
01:16:19,425 --> 01:16:21,177
Honey,
get on the bus!

Get on the bus!

Is Robin Lerner
my mother?

1428
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:10,335
When?

1429
01:17:15,225 --> 01:17:16,658
Uh, 61.

1430
01:17:18,145 --> 01:17:22,616
I'll come down there then.
Thank you.

Jenny, do you want us
to do something?

1433
01:18:31,705 --> 01:18:35,380
You're too late. I already
took care of everything.

1434

Come. Inside the car.
You're getting sick. Please.

1435

I want to talk to you.

Please, come.

1437
01:18:47,905 --> 01:18:49,497
I don't give a shit.

1438
01:18:49,585 --> 01:18:51,257
Go home and tell it
to Chloe.

1439
01:18:51,345 --> 01:18:52,744
I can't.
She left me.

1440
01:18:52,825 --> 01:18:55,623
She's with her mother.
They both got scared.

1441
01:18:55,705 --> 01:18:58,299
Come. I want
to talk to you.

1442
01:18:58,385 --> 01:19:00,535
I need you.

1443
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:02,138
How does it feel?

1444
01:19:06,225 --> 01:19:08,261
I feel like an orphan.

1538
01:26:13,064 --> 01:26:15,373
Well, disastrous.

1539
01:26:15,464 --> 01:26:18,183

the Atlantic Ocean.

It will be 100 feet high,

travelling at
1,100 miles an hour.

1543
01:26:24,104 --> 01:26:26,857
That's faster than
the speed of sound.

1544
01:26:26,944 --> 01:26:29,253
As it reaches shallow water,
it's going to slow down,

1545
01:26:29,344 --> 01:26:30,697
but the wave height,

1546
01:26:30,784 --> 01:26:33,059
depending on the depth
of the shelf off the coast,

1547
01:26:33,144 --> 01:26:37,456
will be anywhere from
1,000 to 3,500 feet high.

1548
01:26:37,544 --> 01:26:40,058
Where the land is flat,

1549
01:26:40,144 --> 01:26:45,502
the wave will wash inland
600 to 700 miles.

1550
01:26:45,584 --> 01:26:50,214
The wave will hit our nation's
capital 40 minutes after impact.

1551

New York City, Boston,

will be nothing less than
an extinction-level event.

1557
01:27:10,384 --> 01:27:13,103
It will strike land
in Western Canada

1558
01:27:13,184 --> 01:27:15,220
3 hours after Biederman.

Within a week,

the skies will be dark
with dust from the impact

at the big one.

1570
01:28:11,064 --> 01:28:13,783
Now, the outgassing
has created a vent

1571
01:28:13,864 --> 01:28:16,253
a half mile wide and
at least 2 miles deep.

1572
01:28:16,344 --> 01:28:18,096
Comet gets closer to the sun,
sun melts the ice,

1573
01:28:18,184 --> 01:28:21,620
ice turns to steam,
we get a big hole, OK?

1574
01:28:21,704 --> 01:28:25,936
So, how many nukes do we
have left in the back?

1575
01:28:26,024 --> 01:28:28,140
4.

1576
01:28:28,224 --> 01:28:32,695
If we can get the remaining
bombs in that vent,

1577
01:28:32,784 --> 01:28:36,618
there shouldn't be anything
left bigger than a suitcase.

1578
01:28:36,704 --> 01:28:38,376
We can't do anything
about the little one,

1579
01:28:38,464 --> 01:28:42,423
but it just might
give them a chance.

1580
01:28:42,504 --> 01:28:44,335
Without the arming codes,

1581
01:28:44,424 --> 01:28:46,858
we're going to have to wait
to set the bomb timers

1582
01:28:46,944 --> 01:28:49,060
until we get closer to Earth
to raise Houston.

1583
01:28:49,144 --> 01:28:51,942
We may not have enough
life support left

1584
01:28:52,024 --> 01:28:53,935
to get back into
the cargo bay for the nukes,

1585
01:28:54,024 --> 01:28:56,015
much less to go down
to the comet.

1586
01:28:56,104 --> 01:28:57,742

enough propellant left

back off the surface

1589

1762
01:44:59,863 --> 01:45:02,377
Show him what
you brought him.

1763
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:05,694
He's holding up
a little rocket.

1764
01:45:05,783 --> 01:45:08,900
That's a mighty powerful
rocket you got there.

1765
01:45:08,983 --> 01:45:10,336
Simon:
He's laughing.

1766
01:45:10,423 --> 01:45:13,574
I can hear him.
I know.

1767

Mariette...

1768
01:45:15,703 --> 01:45:18,297
I'm hugging you both
right now.

1769
01:45:18,383 --> 01:45:19,498
I'm holding you.

Baker: 25 seconds.

1771
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:24,096
Prepare to synchronize
the nukes.

It's been a pleasure

01:45:45,903 --> 01:45:48,417
The honour's
all mine, Andy.

Beck: We watched as the bombs
shattered the second comet

1788
01:47:11,063 --> 01:47:13,054
into a million of pieces
of ice and rock

1789
01:47:13,143 --> 01:47:15,338
that burned harmlessly
in our atmosphere

1790
01:47:15,423 --> 01:47:18,540
and lit up the sky
for an hour.

1791
01:47:18,623 --> 01:47:22,411
Still, we were left with
the devastation of the first.

1792
01:47:22,503 --> 01:47:24,812
The waters
reached as far inland

1793
01:47:24,903 --> 01:47:26,973
as the Ohio
and Tennessee Valleys.

1794
01:47:27,063 --> 01:47:30,499
It washed away
farms and towns...

1795
01:47:30,583 --> 01:47:34,371
forests and skyscrapers.

1796
01:47:34,463 --> 01:47:38,092
But the water receded.

1797
01:47:39,743 --> 01:47:42,735
The wave hit Europe
and Africa, too.

1798
01:47:42,823 --> 01:47:45,701
Millions were lost.

1799
01:47:45,783 --> 01:47:50,015
Countless more
left homeless.

1800
01:47:50,103 --> 01:47:53,652
But the waters receded.

1801
01:47:55,463 --> 01:47:59,138
Cities fall...

1802
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:01,532
but they are rebuilt.

1803
01:48:01,623 --> 01:48:04,262
And heroes die...

1804
01:48:04,343 --> 01:48:07,460
but they are remembered.

1805
01:48:07,543 --> 01:48:10,615
We honour them
with every brick we lay...

1806
01:48:10,703 --> 01:48:13,536
with every field we sow...

1807
01:48:13,623 --> 01:48:17,332
with every child we comfort
and then teach to rejoice

1808
01:48:17,423 --> 01:48:19,459
in what
we have been regiven.

1809
01:48:21,783 --> 01:48:25,492
Our planet.

1810
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,380
Our home.

1811
01:48:29,983 --> 01:48:31,780
So now...

1812
01:48:31,863 --> 01:48:33,376
let us begin.
