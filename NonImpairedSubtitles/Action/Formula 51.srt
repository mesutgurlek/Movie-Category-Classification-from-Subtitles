193
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:08,845
Now, when Mr McElroy joins us, l'd be pleased
if you kept your opinions to yourself.

194
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:13,568
This particular Yank is not a travelling salesman.
He's a genius, hmm?

195
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,614
Who is this cunt?

196
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:23,053
So l said to Mr Durant, l said, ''Mr Durant,

None of this fuckin'

00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,975
None of this asking him

200
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:32,654
No, l said, ''Fuck him.

Once we have the formula,
we could make this stuff in a kitchen.

208
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:05,781
We don't even need Durant.

209
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:08,064
Look. You see that?

210
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,466
That's tomorrow. Blokes are shagging
their mothers-in-law to get a ticket

211
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,382
and l'm getting two from Mr Durant.

212
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:19,583

- He's a deaf-mute.

321
00:23:09,394 --> 00:23:11,191
Stall him. Just stall him.

322
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:14,108
You keep that Yankee cunt happy. And alive.

323
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:16,425
All right, boss. Yeah.

324
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:21,991
Oh! You fucking twat!

325
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,316
What's the plan, then? Freshen up?

326
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:32,517
Massage? Maybe you fancy
a bucket of fried fucking chicken.

327
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,635
lf l wanted cuisine, l'd have gone to Paris .

328
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,789
You can still go to France. lt's not too far.

329
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:40,236
lt's full of pricks and they hate
fucking Yanks too. Do you fancy a bite?

330
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,471
Yeah. All right.

331
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:53,795
Hello, stranger!

332
00:23:56,243 --> 00:23:59,042
Said hello to lover boy yet?

333
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:02,083
- (Laughs)
- lki, l'm in a hurry.

334
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:04,520
Can we get on with it?

335
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:15,682
Ruger mini-1 4, 223 calibre.

336
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,724
lt comes in a fetching chrome.

337
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:21,444
20 rounds per banana.

338
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:25,761
Unless the elite and snazzy lki special
takes your fancy, extending your capacity to 40.

339
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:28,922
- We've got a Czechoslovakian...
- CZ 83, l'll take one.

340
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,443
Oh...

341
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,204
Well, that's young Felix's weapon of choice,
isn't it?

342
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,327
Now, there's a trip down memory lane.

343
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:37,846
l'm partial to a bit of sentiment, me.

344
00:24:37,932 --> 00:24:40,651
l've heard things, you know. He misses you.

345
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,691
So, what are you going to take?

346
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:48,006
l'll take the Baretta, the CZ, an ankle holster,
add the mini-1 4 and l'm done.

347
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:50,528
- l want to get in and out fast.
- Don't we all?

348
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,254
Does Durant still do his deals at the Port Hotel?

349
00:24:53,335 --> 00:24:55,690
Silly lad. lt'll be his undoing, one of these days .

350
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:59,052
But what do you expect from a fella
who gets his arse waxed every month?

351
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,493
l forgot what a circus this place is .

352
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:04,135
Funny, that.

353
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:08,177
l never did much like the circus. All that
poking your head in a lion's mouth shite.

354
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,409
Bring on the horses !
Get 'em rogering the dancing girls !

355
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:13,455
That's a circus .

356
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:16,097
These...and these

357
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:17,772
are on the house.

358
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,895
Welcome home,...Dawn.

359
00:25:31,783 --> 00:25:33,614
- There you go, mate.
- Thanks, mate.

360
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:35,261
Ta.

361
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:46,581
What the fuck did they do to this fish?
Batter it to death?

362
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,736
Fish and chips. The national dish, mate.

363
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:51,466
More like a national disaster.

364
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:54,380
# l said you don't really wanna go, l can tell

365
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,025
# But l'm gonna take you anyway

366
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:57,461
# What the hell?

367
00:25:57,548 --> 00:26:00,108
# So come on, get on in the ride

368
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:02,384
# And let me take you to the other side

369
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,824
# You don't really wanna go, l can tell

370
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:07,468
# But l'm gonna take you anyway

371
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,268
# What the hell?

372
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,501
# So come on, get on in the ride

373
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:14,344
# And let me take you to the other side

374
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:16,468
# l heard you even got a child now

375
00:26:16,552 --> 00:26:17,507
# Look at that

376
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:19,105
# A baby momma and a bow-wow...

377
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:21,149
(Tyres screech)

378
00:26:23,953 --> 00:26:25,306
Keys .

379
00:26:27,674 --> 00:26:29,232
Twat.

380
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:31,271
Come on.

381
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:36,712
So, er...

382
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:39,435
How much are they paying you
to wear that skirt?

383
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:48,474
Fag?

384
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,635
No, motherfucker.

385
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,996
(Sniggers )

386
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:05,798
(Knock at door)

387
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:13,242
Ah, Mr McElroy!

388
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,679
That's daring, but very dashing attire.

389
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:17,436
Let's stick to the business in hand.

390
00:27:18,124 --> 00:27:21,162
Hey, come on! Mr McElroy's a guest of ours .

391
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:26,006
OK boys Gurhs orh the tabe pease

392
00:27:27,086 --> 00:27:28,041
Felix?

393
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:30,436
l've delivered him. l'll have my tickets and be off.

394
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:32,040
OK. Put your gun on the table.

395
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:35,837
- Fuck. The game's tomorrow.
- Put your fucking gun on the table, you gobshite!

396
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:39,245
What?

397
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:41,718
- So, who's the chemist?
- This is Pudsey Smith.

398
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,845
A first-class man. Qualified and everything.

399
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:46,688
He can't talk. He's been shot.

400
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:57,762
Felix, have you shit your pants, or something?

401
00:27:57,852 --> 00:27:59,763
Something doesn't feel right, Mr Durant.

402
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:03,766
l know. You're making me nervous ,
for fuck's sake! Sit on your hands, or something.

403
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:06,448
OK, Mr McElroy, the ball's in your court.

404
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:19,727
McELROY: MDMA utses serotorhrh

405
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:23,014
Opates ke herorh utse dopamrhe

406
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:26,534
Sort of like the same sensation you get after sex.

407
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:29,007
Amphetamrhes rhcrease adrerharhe

408
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:34,014
and cocaine gets those synapses in the brain
firing really fast.

409
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:38,218
My product is 51 times stronger than cocaine.

410
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,293
51 times more hallucinogenic than acid

411
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:44,214
and 51 times more explosive than ecstasy.

412
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:46,621
lt's like a personal visit...

413
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:49,534
..from God.

414
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:52,376
lt's that good?

415
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:57,258
The dog's bollocks .

416
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:20,099
Felix DeSouza.

417
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:22,623
- l count ten.
- That's right.

418
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:26,749
That's one million sterling,
or 1 ...1 .6 million dollars .

419
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,900
But that ain't what we agreed on, is it?

420
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,744
You're 1 8.4 million dollars shy.

421
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:35,427
And l don't care how you cut it,
that's a whole lot shy.

422
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:37,468
No...

423
00:29:37,552 --> 00:29:40,272
Mr McElroy, what we have there
is a goodwill gesture.

424
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:41,866
A deposit. A down payment.

425
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:44,468
One and a half million's not a bad start, is it?

426
00:29:44,554 --> 00:29:49,390
l need to do some research. l need to feed
a few thousand to the kids, get some feedback.

427
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:52,626
You don't think l can allow you
to walk out of here with $20 million

428
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:54,707
for a formula that only exists in your head?

429
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:57,310
And all l get is what?

430
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,353
An ointment for toe jam.

431
00:30:01,037 --> 00:30:02,993
Uh-huh?

432
00:30:04,077 --> 00:30:05,431
- Market research.
- Right.

433
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:07,634
Profile customers, send out questionnaires .

434
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,594
Get out the bloody way, Felix.

435
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,039
l can dig that. But unless you've got what
we agreed on, what the fuck am l doing here?

436
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:22,316
Give me a call when you're ready to deal.

437
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:24,836
(Banging on door)
- l fucking knew it.

438
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:29,235
(Quavery voice) Room service.

439
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:31,279
That old fuckin' chestnut.

440
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:33,558
Aaargh!

441
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:36,316
Hey hod t feas

442
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:38,999
lt's my sausage and flamin' mash!

443
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:41,360
- (Screams)
- Ssh...

444
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:44,438
Sorry, love. Sorry about that, pet.

445
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,403
lt's just that er...

446
00:30:46,486 --> 00:30:48,317
my dad ran off with a room service maid.

447
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:50,875
Things have never really been the same since.

448
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,639
Bollocks .

449
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,320
(Phone rings )

450
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:00,723
Now's not a good time.

451
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,606
- Charhge ofparh
- What do you mean?

452
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:04,248
l want McElroy kept alive.

453
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,888
l don't do alive, l do dead.

454
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,528
t's a matter of$20 morh

455
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,283
in cash being vaporised,

456
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:12,568
and it's a matter of a lot of anger
being directed at The Lizardman.

457
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:14,210
You now do alive.

458
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:18,331
My future s rhsde McEroy's sku

459
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:21,371
You waste anything
and everybody that gets near him.

460
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:24,173
You waste them, not him.

461
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:27,246
Hs mrhd beorhgs to The Lzard

462
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:29,132
Shit.

463
00:31:35,536 --> 00:31:37,288
Fucking hell!

464
00:31:40,337 --> 00:31:42,293
Shit, shit, shit!

465
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:51,177
Arsehole.

466
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:55,780
Let go, you double-crosser.
Let go! They're mrhe

467
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,215
Oh!

00:32:09,023 --> 00:32:10,536
Oh, shit.

469
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:28,424
Shit.

470
00:32:34,148 --> 00:32:36,025
Ow! Shit!

471
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:38,623
l told you to get out of the way, Felix.

472
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:40,665
- Fuck! l've been shot.

473
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:42,626
ln the fucking arse!

474
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:44,860
Man, it's just a flesh wound. Come on.

475
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,421
Flesh wound? ls that supposed
to sound like a fuckin' good thing?

476
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:54,463
(Arguing)

477
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:56,747
Come on, dude.

478
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:00,187

Get your fat arse out of the flamin' car.

What the fuck are you doing?

496
00:34:10,127 --> 00:34:11,845
Woah...

Just take a fucking left!

498
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:19,122
(Siren)

499
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,808
- Get off the pavement!

504
00:34:42,174 --> 00:34:43,129
Hey

506
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:03,336
Fuck!

507

You! Out of my fuckin' way!

508
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:20,253
- Oh, bollocks .
- The dog's bollocks?

509
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:22,621
No. Just plain fucking bollocks .

510
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:24,101
- No dogs involved?
- No!

511
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:26,615
Watch out! Watch out!

512
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:31,896
You'll kill the fucking car!

513
00:35:37,225 --> 00:35:39,455
Fuck.

514
00:35:40,745 --> 00:35:42,623
Oh! Fuck.

515

(Siren)

516
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,467
Hello?

517
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,826
So, let me get this straight.

518
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,142
''Bollocks'' is bad,
whereas ''the dog's bollocks'' is good, huh?

519
00:36:09,231 --> 00:36:10,903
Yeah.

520
00:36:12,192 --> 00:36:13,671
(Engine revs )

521
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:15,265
Oh, bollocks .

522
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:23,432
Gotcha.

523
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,512
Come on, then!

524
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:38,586

Aaa-aargh!

526
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:50,277
- Stop.
- God. Fucking Yanks .

527
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:51,554
Come on!

528
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,670
Shit.

Fucking hell.

530
00:37:01,242 --> 00:37:03,198
Scraping my fucking paintwork!

531
00:37:04,162 --> 00:37:06,472
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

532
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:09,680
- Fuck you, Kane, you shitebag.
- Fuck off!

533
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:14,115
(Squawks like a chicken)

534
00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:15,478
Oh, you little fuck!

535
00:37:15,564 --> 00:37:17,874
Chicken bollocks .

536
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,239
Shit!

537
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:23,282
Whoa-oa!

538
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,717
Fuck you, Kane, you fucking wanker!

539
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:30,162
(Sirens )

540
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:58,483
Come here, you!

541
00:37:58,573 --> 00:38:00,211
- Are you all right?
- Fuck off!

542
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:05,610
We've lost them.

543
00:38:05,695 --> 00:38:07,890
(Ship's horn)

544
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:13,172
Yeah, well, let's not take any chances .

545
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,816
Oh...

546
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,336
Oh, shit!

547
00:38:55,385 --> 00:38:57,341
Ugh...

548
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:00,578
Are you wanting to junk that, pal?

549
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:01,655
You what?

550
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:04,499
Dude, do you have a car that works?
l need transportation.

551
00:39:04,586 --> 00:39:06,418
l've got a Cooper needing a lick of paint.

552
00:39:06,507 --> 00:39:10,023
She goes. Throw in the XJ6
and she's yours for a 1 00 quid.

553
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:13,896
- Deal.
- What, a Cooper? Piss off, Popeye. And you.

554
00:39:13,988 --> 00:39:16,105
' teyou what 70 qud arhd the Jag

555
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:17,747
and l'm robbing myself.

556
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:20,424
Tha...that's it. That's it.

557
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:23,149
've hadjust about erhough ofths shte

00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:27,187
l got you out of that deal in one piece.

560
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:30,309
As far as l'm concerned, my job's done.
lt's finished.

561
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:33,941
You can leave my motor alone,
get your golf clubs, and fuck off back to Dixie.

562
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:36,422
Pay attention, Felix DeSouza.

563
00:39:36,513 --> 00:39:40,905
l atomised a major drugs syndicate
to be here this morning.

564
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:45,386
Now, l'm stuck in Liver-fucking-fool with you!

565
00:39:45,475 --> 00:39:51,426
And if l need you to sell your car to help me,
you will sell your goddamn car!

566
00:39:58,077 --> 00:40:00,194
Do l look like the Salvation Army?

567
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:03,190
Have l got Jim'll Fix lt written on my fucking hat?

568
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:06,828
l'm sorry, mate, but help's not a word
l'm too familiar with, you know.

569
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:08,830
(Camptown Races ringtone)

570
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,310
Fuck off!

571
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:37,521
l don't believe it.

572
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:41,242
So, who's the girl?

573
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,401
lt's my ex-girlfriend.

574
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:53,364
Arthur. l want you to describe the situation to me.

575
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:56,680
Seven shades of shit in a one-shit trumpet, sir.

576
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:59,364
lt looks like some kind of a drugs buy.

577
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,042
Norhe ofyour ordrhary

578
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,487
Aye aye. Got some blue tabs .
They look like sweets .

579
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:06,527
How are you?

580
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:09,684
What do you mean, how am l?
Nearly cut my fucking ear off!

581
00:41:09,772 --> 00:41:11,728
And l've hurt my knee.

582
00:41:11,812 --> 00:41:16,728
Now, l want you to get the pills and take them
straight down to the lab, double time.

583
00:41:16,813 --> 00:41:20,523
You got that? And then you call me.
Now, what else have you got?

584
00:41:21,414 --> 00:41:22,893
Six dead bodies and one live one.

585
00:41:22,974 --> 00:41:25,409
- (Groans )
- Chief, it's Leopold Durant.

586
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:28,727
Durant? Right. Now, concentrate, Arthur.

587
00:41:28,816 --> 00:41:32,525
Get that fat fuck down here pronto.

588
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,130
But, sir, he's dying.

589
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:37,175
Then you'd better be fucking quick about it,
hadn't you?

590
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:39,173
(Foghorn)

591
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:43,735
She dumped me.

592
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:47,215
Two years ago now.

593
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,854
Changed her name from Dawn to Dakota.

594
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,580
Fucked off for Las Vegas and a deck of cards .

595
00:41:54,661 --> 00:41:56,856
So who hired her to take me out?

596
00:41:56,941 --> 00:41:59,172
You're asking the wrong question, mate.

597
00:42:00,862 --> 00:42:03,057
She's your guardian angel.

598
00:42:05,383 --> 00:42:07,897
fshe warhtedyou dead you'd be dead

599
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,940
She never misses .

600
00:42:10,024 --> 00:42:11,980
l mean, fucking look at that.

601
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:18,094
lf she really wanted to hit me...l'd be shiteing
through a tube for the rest of my life.

602
00:42:20,546 --> 00:42:23,380
Someone wants you kept alive.

603
00:42:30,268 --> 00:42:34,547
Somebody's trying to cut in on Durant's deal.
They're shitting again.

604
00:42:34,629 --> 00:42:36,904
- Yeah, well, shit happens .
- No

605
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,345
Shit don't just happen, shit takes time.

606
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,386
Shit takes effort.

607
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,541
$20 million-worth of effort.

608
00:42:44,471 --> 00:42:46,029
(Metallic ping)

609
00:42:46,111 --> 00:42:48,467
l've got to get a new deal on, fast.

610
00:42:48,552 --> 00:42:51,112
You know the town, you know the players .

611
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:52,830
Look...

612
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:56,589
..all l want is a ticket for the game.

613
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:58,630
Do you think you can swing that?

614
00:42:58,714 --> 00:43:02,150
$20 million could swing anything.
You know what l'm selling.

615
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:04,191
Well, how much?

616
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:07,028
5% of whatever l get out of any deal you set up.

617
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:09,072
That's a million dollars .

618
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:12,228
Hell, you could buy your own
goddamn stadium with that.

619
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:19,276
- Game's tomorrow.
- You'd better get started, then.

620
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:21,314
Oh, and Felix.

621
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,913
A word of advice.

622
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:27,675
You ever want to get the girl,
you've got to broaden your horizons .

623
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,476
(Distant metallic ping)

624
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,237
KANE: What the fuck is that?

625
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:39,278
What is it?

626
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:41,318
What? Scotch mist?

627
00:43:42,803 --> 00:43:45,078
Now, now, now, now, now.

628
00:43:45,163 --> 00:43:47,678
You are getting greedy, Leopold.

629
00:43:48,724 --> 00:43:54,561
lt's a big deal going down, and you are trying to
cut me out of the fucking loop.

630
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:59,197
- (Leopold screams in agony)
- l told you. Face the fuck front!

631
00:44:00,966 --> 00:44:03,003
(Coughs and chokes )

632
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:04,839
This is going to cost you

633
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:07,362
an additional 1 5%.

634
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:08,767
No?

635
00:44:08,848 --> 00:44:10,440
All right, then. 30.

636
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:12,086
As you're being so difficult.

637
00:44:12,168 --> 00:44:16,720
How about this?
50-50. Why settle for anything less, eh?

638
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,606
60-40.

639
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:27,039
Leopold, l don't know if you noticed, my son,

Brothers gorhrha work t out

00:55:15,982 --> 00:55:19,976
He's a chemical brother! Mr McElroy...welcome.

803
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,817
- How you doing, man?
- Spectacular is what l'm doing.

804
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:24,940
Spectacuar

805
00:55:25,024 --> 00:55:27,664
Nice skirt. Special occasion, is it?

806
00:55:27,745 --> 00:55:30,054
(lki laughs )

807
00:55:30,145 --> 00:55:33,343
- Are you going to be all right here on your own?
- Mm-hm.

808
00:55:33,426 --> 00:55:35,382
- She's here.
- Right.

809
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:39,779
- Everything all right, lads? Problems?
- No, man. Nothing we can't handle.

Every chemical used in the production
of this drug is 1 00% legal.

Not one ingredient is found on any known
government's banned substance watch list.

818
00:56:14,114 --> 00:56:16,754
Hell, you can ship supertankers of this shit.

819
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:21,272
You can even lay a goddamn pipeline
and no-one would bat an eye.

820
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:28,712
P-O-S 51 .

821
00:56:28,797 --> 00:56:31,231
lt's all that.

822
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:33,991
And it can be yours .

823
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:36,798
lf the price...is right.

824
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,594
Chemistry...Mr McElroy.

825
00:57:03,644 --> 00:57:05,600
What is chemistry...

826
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:10,520
..but the ability to attract adoration in others?

827
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:18,441
You see, you're like me, Mr McElroy.

828
00:57:18,527 --> 00:57:21,918
You're a sky-highatrist, l'm a sky-highatrist.

829
00:57:22,008 --> 00:57:25,284
See  aways krhew 'd be a drug deaer
everh wherh  was a kd

830
00:57:25,368 --> 00:57:28,088
 saw my dad ht my mother
my mother ht my brother

831
00:57:28,169 --> 00:57:30,889
my brother hit my sister,
and my sister fuck my father.

832
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,642
So it's inevitable, really.

833
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:36,610
You'd have to be on drugs
just to live in that madhouse, wouldn't you?

834
00:57:36,691 --> 00:57:39,603
Drugs are good, Mr McElroy.

835
00:57:40,651 --> 00:57:42,608
Drugs are our mates .

836
00:57:44,452 --> 00:57:47,889
Fuck. l'm getting on my own nerves .

837
00:57:49,413 --> 00:57:52,212
What l'm trying to say to you, Mr McElroy, is...

838
00:57:55,134 --> 00:57:59,174
..l'm very much attracted
to what you have to offer.

839
00:57:59,255 --> 00:58:01,770
(lki chuckles )

840
00:58:11,298 --> 00:58:13,209
How are you doing, Felix?

841
00:58:14,298 --> 00:58:16,255
Well, my boss is dead...

842
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:19,688
..can't get a ticket for tomorrow's match,

843
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:22,931
and, oh, yeah,
l've got a fucking bullet hole in the arse.

844
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,779
Apart from that,

845
00:58:25,861 --> 00:58:27,817
l'm tiptop.

846
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:33,293
So who's the target?

847
00:58:33,382 --> 00:58:35,977
You've got that look in your eye.

848
00:58:36,063 --> 00:58:38,019
l've been looking for you

849
00:58:38,103 --> 00:58:41,779
Oh, yeah? For old times' sake
or for the company l keep?

850
00:58:41,864 --> 00:58:43,900
Little bit of both.

851
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:48,501
So, you have got me on your list, then?

852
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:51,702
You've always been on my list.

853
00:58:54,186 --> 00:58:56,701
- (Whooping and cheering)
- 40 years ago

854
00:58:56,787 --> 00:59:01,100
a rock-and-roll revolution
was launched in this town.

855
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:02,541
(Wild cheering)

856
00:59:02,628 --> 00:59:06,622
Tonight, we're going to launch a rhew revolution.

857
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:13,827
One that will rock and roll your senses .

858
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:15,424
(Cheering)

859
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:19,265
And you...are my test pilots .

860
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:26,668
You're going to kiss the sun
and taste the motherfuckin' rainbow.

861
00:59:26,753 --> 00:59:30,542
(Wild cheering)

862
00:59:32,034 --> 00:59:35,266
- Are you ready?
- (Cheering)

863
00:59:35,355 --> 00:59:39,587
- Are...you...ready?
- (Cheering)

864
00:59:39,675 --> 00:59:45,035
Then let's get ready to party-y-y-y.

865
00:59:46,637 --> 00:59:49,675
# THRlLLSEEKERS: Synaesthesia (Fly Away)

866
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:29,441
Have you any idea how much l missed you?

867
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:31,118
Why didn't you stay with me, then?

868
01:00:31,206 --> 01:00:33,766
What, me? ln America? Don't be soft!

869
01:00:33,846 --> 01:00:36,680
Besides, l don't know who you are any more, girl.

870
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:40,647
lt's been nearly two years .
l haven't heard a word.

871
01:00:43,608 --> 01:00:45,565
Still...

872
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,327
l always hoped...

873
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,886
..you might...

874
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:55,643
change your mind...

875
01:00:56,691 --> 01:00:59,160
..and come home.

876
01:01:02,212 --> 01:01:04,169
We could have a fresh start.

877
01:01:07,653 --> 01:01:09,610
Aren't you going to say anything?

878
01:01:37,779 --> 01:01:41,011
This, Mr McElroy, is a fucking miracle.

879
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:46,016
Drug use will reach epidemic proportions ,
revolutions will break out, governments will fall!

880
01:01:46,861 --> 01:01:49,422
20 million, and not a penny less !

881
01:01:49,502 --> 01:01:51,732
- Where do l sign?
- Si... Sign?!

882
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:53,779
This ain't some written contract.

883
01:01:53,863 --> 01:01:56,935
The kind of agreement l could take you to court
and sue your ass over.

884
01:01:57,023 --> 01:01:58,980
You fuck me on this deal,

885
01:01:59,064 --> 01:02:02,181
l gotta take out a contract just to get even
on the goddamn contract!

886
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:05,302
We think we have an agreement,
we think we see things the same way.

887
01:02:05,385 --> 01:02:06,579
Either we do, or we don't.

888
01:02:06,665 --> 01:02:08,337
You're either in, or you're out.

889
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:11,145
You give me the money, l give you the formula.
Are we clear?

890
01:02:12,226 --> 01:02:15,697
Crystal, Mr McElroy. Crystal.

891
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:18,825
l'm not Leo Durant. l'm a man of my word.

892
01:02:18,908 --> 01:02:20,864
Get in my way,

893
01:02:20,948 --> 01:02:23,018
and l'm gonna have to shoot you.

894
01:02:25,469 --> 01:02:27,824
Get in my way,
and l'm gonna have to shoot you again.

895
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:31,466
l've got to work, babe.

896
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:37,220
Fucking cow!

897
01:02:40,512 --> 01:02:42,423
(Screaming)

898
01:02:43,633 --> 01:02:45,351
Oh, fuck!

899
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:50,863
Can't a brother just deal some goddamn drugs?

900
01:02:53,435 --> 01:02:55,949
Time to go, Elmo.

901
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:13,267
Mr Kane. ls it that time of the month already?

902
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,715
l thought you weren't due till next week,
you eager beaver.

903
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,840
Now, ain't that always the way?

904
01:03:27,922 --> 01:03:30,516
Elevator music, a nigger in a kilt,

905
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:33,481
and a chick with a nickel-plated nine.

906
01:03:33,563 --> 01:03:35,519
(Mobile rings )

907
01:03:37,403 --> 01:03:39,360
And now a word from our sponsor.

908
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:41,400
That ain't no Liverpool accent.

909
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:44,641
- Say hello, Elmo.
- Hello, Elmo.

910
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:48,002
Abserhce makes the heart grow forhder Emo

911
01:03:48,086 --> 01:03:50,805
Arhd The Lzard s so fu of

01:03:57,487 --> 01:03:59,160

915
01:03:59,248 --> 01:04:01,557
- You w be.
- You got my cash?

916
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:04,322
You're flush, sweetcakes. You are flush.

917
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,527
He's looking forward to seeing you.

918
01:04:20,332 --> 01:04:23,131
So, what's the price tag on my ass?

919
01:04:23,213 --> 01:04:25,169
lt's enough. Move.

920
01:04:34,935 --> 01:04:36,334
(Screams )

921
01:04:38,936 --> 01:04:42,212
Last stop. There's nowhere from here but down.

922
01:04:42,297 --> 01:04:43,776
Reel me in!

923
01:04:43,857 --> 01:04:46,052
Why would l do a stupid thing like that?

924
01:04:46,137 --> 01:04:49,130
- Pull me up, will you?
- Fold or call?

925
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:53,098
- What?
- You play poker. Fold or call?

926
01:04:53,179 --> 01:04:55,249
- (Whimpers )
- l'm your last chance, girl.

927
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:57,456
l'm that out you've been looking for.

928
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,338
l'm only gonna make this offer once.

929
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,855
You either take it
and get out from under The Lizard,

930
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:05,580
or you stay a slave
and wonder where your life went.

931
01:05:05,661 --> 01:05:08,813
You think you can save me, do you?
Look where you are!

932
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:12,259
- Get real!
- A million in bonds, untraceable.

933
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:15,141
That's real! That's a fresh start.

934
01:05:15,223 --> 01:05:18,773
Try quitting while you're ahead
for a change...Dawn.

935
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:20,900
- No.
- No?!

936
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:22,941
(Screams )

937
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:26,823
l want 1 0% of your deal with lki.

938
01:05:26,905 --> 01:05:28,464
You're negotiating with me?!

939
01:05:28,546 --> 01:05:30,104
Look at your options .

940
01:05:32,507 --> 01:05:34,145
1 0%.

941
01:05:34,227 --> 01:05:36,263
Have a look at yours .

942
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:41,901
All right.

943
01:05:41,989 --> 01:05:43,183
(Screams )

944
01:05:52,951 --> 01:05:55,829
Now that is a lovely dress .

957
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:33,435
And l, Virgil Kane...

958
01:06:34,479 --> 01:06:36,436
Well, l want to know why.

959
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:41,549
Nobody cuts me out of anything
in this parochial pisshole.

960
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,474
You smell that, Felix. Smell it.

961
01:06:43,561 --> 01:06:45,836
- Smell it!
- (Sniffs )

962
01:06:45,921 --> 01:06:47,878
That is essence of Durant.

963
01:06:49,122 --> 01:06:51,796
And Durant got what he deserved.

964
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:54,317
So, when a deal goes down,

965
01:06:54,403 --> 01:06:57,874
you, my old sausage, will fix it. Time and place.

966
01:06:57,964 --> 01:07:00,034
And then you will call me.

967
01:07:00,124 --> 01:07:03,117
Otherwise... Accessory to murder.

968
01:07:04,165 --> 01:07:06,885
Possession of a firearm.

969
01:07:06,966 --> 01:07:08,718
You fuck me,

970
01:07:08,806 --> 01:07:10,797
l'll have you on your hands and your knees ,

971
01:07:10,886 --> 01:07:15,085
with your arse in the air, exposing your rusty
sheriff's badge for the next 20 years .

972
01:07:17,608 --> 01:07:20,520
So ask yourself, are you going to help restore

973
01:07:20,608 --> 01:07:22,884
some national pride,
and stick one on the Yanks?

974
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:26,007
Or, like the rest of your life,
are you going to piss it all away?

975
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,725
Are you going to help me

976
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:31,403
to help you?

977
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:33,447
Eight hours till kickoff.

978
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:37,570
lt's a big game.

979
01:07:38,652 --> 01:07:41,531
Let's just see if you come good.

980
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:53,254
Mr Kane.

981
01:07:59,456 --> 01:08:01,971
See ya! (Chuckles )

982
01:08:03,817 --> 01:08:06,457
- You'll never walk alone, eh, mate?
- (Laughs )

983
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,015
(Deactivates car alarm)

984
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,057
(Laughs )

985
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:24,737
Help me to help you? Cunt!

986
01:08:52,787 --> 01:08:56,098
ELMO: How do you thrhk that motherfucker

DAWN: Busht

990
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:08,946
Kevin Brown couldn't carry
Sandy Koufax's jockstrap.

991
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:11,340
You've been listening to too much Vince Scully.

992
01:09:11,431 --> 01:09:15,550
You need to get your ear out of the radio,
and carry your ass out to the ball game.

993
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:19,068
Sorry, but er...

994
01:09:20,113 --> 01:09:21,705
..have l missed something?

995
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:28,867
What the fuck is that?

996
01:09:28,954 --> 01:09:32,789
- Black pudding. Fried pig's blood.
- Oh!

997
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:35,344
Are you two planning on filling me in, or what?

998
01:09:37,516 --> 01:09:39,393
Elmo's propositioned her.

999
01:09:39,476 --> 01:09:41,547
Nice one, Shirley.

1000
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:43,150
l'm listening.

1001
01:09:43,237 --> 01:09:47,197
Lizard offered Dakota 250K
to deliver my live ass to him.

1002
01:09:47,278 --> 01:09:50,794
l've made her a significantly better offer.

1003
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:53,552
And l'm thinking...she might entertain...

1004
01:09:54,599 --> 01:09:57,034
..certain sentimental reasons
for not doing her job.

1005
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,872
The questorh s

1006
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,112
whether it's going to pay me...to be sentimental.

1007
01:10:07,282 --> 01:10:09,477
Look, we have a choice.

1008
01:10:10,203 --> 01:10:13,991
We can use our ''Get out of jail free'' cards ,

1009
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:19,796
or we can choose ''Stop, do not pass Go''.
Do not collect 20 million dollars .

1010
01:10:21,205 --> 01:10:23,161
Do we have a deal?

1011
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:30,480
Do that again, l will definitely fucking shoot you.

1012
01:10:30,567 --> 01:10:33,035
Shut your gob! Go and get yourself cleaned up!

1013
01:10:41,489 --> 01:10:43,525
- And no shagging up there!
- Yeah.

1014
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:45,999
No shagging up there.

1015
01:10:58,732 --> 01:11:00,689
We do this job and we get out.

1016
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:11,331
lt's what we all want, isn't it?

1017
01:11:13,855 --> 01:11:15,812
# l don't know why

1018
01:11:17,096 --> 01:11:19,850
# l love you like l do, but l do

1019
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:21,256
Just to get out.

1020
01:11:25,738 --> 01:11:27,968
# l don't know why

1021
01:11:28,058 --> 01:11:30,493
# You treat me like you do

1022
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:32,535
# But you do

1023
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:35,616
# Lord, you do

1024
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,656
So, what's the plan?

1025
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,697
You tell me.

1026
01:11:43,621 --> 01:11:46,090
# Lord, you do me any way you please

1027
01:11:47,142 --> 01:11:49,099
What's the plan?

1028
01:11:49,183 --> 01:11:50,741
You tell me.

1029
01:11:50,823 --> 01:11:52,779
# No matter how you treat me, woman

1030
01:11:55,424 --> 01:11:58,940
# Lord, l just can't seem to leave

1031
01:12:00,225 --> 01:12:02,181
# l don't know

1032
01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:06,179
# What you're using on me, baby, but it's good

1033
01:12:08,426 --> 01:12:10,224
# Ooh, it's real good

1034
01:12:12,747 --> 01:12:16,787
# l know l would surely leave you, woman

1035
01:12:16,868 --> 01:12:18,825
# Oh, if l could

1036
01:12:19,829 --> 01:12:21,979
# l surely would

1037
01:12:23,109 --> 01:12:24,782
# Ooh

1038
01:12:29,271 --> 01:12:31,227
(Squeaks )

(Chanting)

1040
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:40,983
Listen! lt's got to come from your belly.

1041
01:12:41,073 --> 01:12:43,542
Right deep down!

1042
01:12:43,634 --> 01:12:45,590
lt's your birth trauma.

1043
01:12:45,674 --> 01:12:49,509
Now cleanse your chakras and let it all out.

1044
01:12:52,395 --> 01:12:54,352
(Chant)

1045
01:12:55,676 --> 01:12:58,953
- Let it go!

A-a-a-a-ah!

01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,317
(Mobile rings )

1050
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:13,397
- All-righty. Good morning.
- All right, let's finish this deal.

1051
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,436
My sentiments exactly.

1052
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,393
- Any particular venue?
- No arports rho hote rooms

1053
01:13:19,481 --> 01:13:22,678
no dockyards, no barges, no pharmacies ,

No abandoned warehouses or rave clubs .

l want total privacy

1058
01:13:35,124 --> 01:13:37,684
in a very public place.

1059
01:13:38,965 --> 01:13:40,921
And security.

1060
01:13:41,005 --> 01:13:43,236
Cops. Lots of them.

1061
01:13:43,326 --> 01:13:46,318
And witnesses. Thousands of witnesses .

1062
01:13:46,406 --> 01:13:49,956

A perfect Saturday afternoon.

And try for fuck's sake to blend in, cunt!

1078

This clown better deliver.

1079

Don't worry. lki put something like this together
a couple of years ago now.

1080
01:14:49,179 --> 01:14:50,737
Yeah? What happened?

1081
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,298
They all died.

1082

We get in, we get out.

1083
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,337
What about the game?

1084

01:17:06,807 --> 01:17:10,880
What?! ls that supposed to be 20 mill?

1114
01:17:10,967 --> 01:17:14,881
l'm not heftin' gold bars around the shop, am l?
lt's not fucking Goldfinger, is it?

1115
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:16,368
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

1116
01:17:16,449 --> 01:17:18,405
Easy, flower.

1117
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:20,161
Where's my formula?

1118
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:31,687
Wish you were here?

1119
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:40,052
(Laughs )

1120
01:17:40,133 --> 01:17:42,090
(Continues laughing)

1121
01:17:43,974 --> 01:17:47,854
l'm fucking there, Mr McElroy. l'm fucking there.

1122

An inspired choice, l must say,

1123
01:17:50,055 --> 01:17:52,854
my er...chemical brother.

1124
01:17:53,456 --> 01:17:54,411
Cheers .

1125
01:17:57,017 --> 01:17:58,735
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

1126
01:18:04,618 --> 01:18:07,133
l never was one to be too sentimental.

1127
01:18:09,619 --> 01:18:11,576
Elmo!

1128
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:14,818
t arh't ofterh

1129
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:19,292
that a blowed-up motherfucker gets to chat
to the motherfucker that blowed him up.

1130
01:18:19,381 --> 01:18:21,100
You got that right.

1131
01:18:21,182 --> 01:18:24,811
Usually, the blowed-up motherfucker
has the courtesy to stay blowed up.

1132
01:18:24,902 --> 01:18:27,656
l'll try to be more accommodating next time,
Elmo.

1133
01:18:29,943 --> 01:18:32,219
Ooh, cocktails! What are we celebrating?

1134
01:18:32,304 --> 01:18:34,943
Oh, er...we're toasting...

1137
01:18:40,546 --> 01:18:42,616

1142
01:18:55,749 --> 01:18:57,944
LlZARD: To a gobapartrhershp

1143
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:03,543

Fucking limey bastard.

1145
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,868
Global partnership, my ass !

1146
01:19:09,951 --> 01:19:14,389
My money is on good old-fashioned
American monopoly, you son of a bitch!

1147
01:19:14,472 --> 01:19:16,270
Besides ,

1148
01:19:16,353 --> 01:19:18,992
England ain't nothin'...

1149
01:19:19,073 --> 01:19:22,146
rhothrh' but the 51 st state!

1150
01:19:23,234 --> 01:19:28,263
Don't you just fucking hate it
when a motherfucker stabs you in the back?

1151
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:34,670
The Lizard travelled 1 2,000 miles
to settle accounts with you!

1152
01:19:34,756 --> 01:19:36,315
So? What?

1153
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:39,355
You gonna tell me how much you missed me,
or are you gonna shoot me?

1154
01:19:39,437 --> 01:19:42,236
l'm sick and tired of fucking chasing your ass !

1155
01:19:42,318 --> 01:19:45,755
Now, you give me my fucking goods ,
and you give 'em to me fucking now!

1156
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:49,514
You better chill with that shit, motherfucker.

1157
01:19:49,599 --> 01:19:51,556
-  owrh you
- You owrh me?

1158
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,313
- l fucking own you!
- You own shit!

1159
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:58,280
Go ahead, kill me. Put me out of my misery
for the first time in 30 years .

1160
01:19:58,361 --> 01:20:00,876
But you will no longer take what is mine.

1161
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,395
Fucking right. 1 0% is mine.

1162
01:20:02,482 --> 01:20:05,793
- Five!
- Five fucking per cent of that's mine.

1163
01:20:05,883 --> 01:20:08,397
Shut the fuck up!
l don't even know who the fuck you are!

1164
01:20:11,604 --> 01:20:13,754
Oh, you've got some big fucking onions, Elmo.

1165
01:20:13,844 --> 01:20:15,801
This...

1166
01:20:15,885 --> 01:20:19,275
is the most expensive candy on the market.

1167
01:20:19,365 --> 01:20:21,516
The drug's a fake, you know.

1168
01:20:21,606 --> 01:20:25,646
lt's bogus. lt's what we chemists call a placebo.

1169
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:27,683
lt's whatever you want it to be.

1170
01:20:29,007 --> 01:20:33,001
You can run all the tests you want,
and it'll look like the best shit in the universe,

1171
01:20:33,088 --> 01:20:37,640
but the ingredients...they cancel each other out.

1172
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:41,769
Fucking confusing The Lizard
ain't gonna fucking help your cause, Elmo.

1173
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:44,000
You've gotta give big ups to marketing.

1174
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,047
The ability to make people believe.

1175
01:20:46,131 --> 01:20:48,087
The power of suggestion.

1176
01:20:48,171 --> 01:20:50,606
P-O-S

1177
01:20:50,692 --> 01:20:52,648
51 .

1178
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:56,527
l don't give a shit!
ls this fucking science lecture over?

1179
01:20:56,613 --> 01:20:59,845
lt will be in...23 seconds .

1180
01:21:03,774 --> 01:21:06,812
t takes 10 secorhds for arh mbbed qud
to reach the stomach

1181
01:21:06,975 --> 01:21:11,970
lt takes the human body 81 seconds to heat
that liquid to the point of chemical volatility.

1182
01:21:14,257 --> 01:21:16,725
You...have 1 2 seconds left.

1183
01:21:16,817 --> 01:21:19,252
1 2 seconds?
What the fuck are you talking about?

1184
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:21,135
And what is the big fucking umbrella?

1185
01:21:21,218 --> 01:21:22,537
Freeze!

1186
01:21:22,618 --> 01:21:24,337
- Oh!
- You umpy

1187
01:21:24,419 --> 01:21:25,818
in the kaftan, drop the gun.

1188
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:29,050
Nice and controlled. How's my timing, Felix?

1189
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,619
lt's fucking perfect.

1190
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,691
Ow! Argh!

1191
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:35,011
(Gurgling)

1192
01:21:37,581 --> 01:21:39,334
Aaaargh!

1193
01:21:39,422 --> 01:21:40,696
Aargh!

1194
01:21:40,782 --> 01:21:42,215
(Cheering)

1195
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:43,860
(Whistle)

1196
01:21:43,942 --> 01:21:46,503
(Cheering)

1197
01:21:53,824 --> 01:21:55,781
That cleared my sinuses .

1198
01:21:58,465 --> 01:22:00,422
Drugs...

1199
01:22:00,506 --> 01:22:02,337
always kill you in the end.

1200
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:16,827
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa, shit!

1201
01:22:16,909 --> 01:22:19,105
(Mutters )

1202
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:21,658
All right, lads .

1203
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,185
Get the cuffs on this cockney twat!

1204
01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:29,588
As agreed.

1205
01:22:31,352 --> 01:22:33,308
What about the drug?

1206
01:22:33,392 --> 01:22:35,907
You conned us .

1207
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:37,949
l conned them

1208
01:22:38,033 --> 01:22:40,264
We got paid.

1209
01:22:42,234 --> 01:22:43,269
ls this ,

1210
01:22:43,354 --> 01:22:45,915
or is this not, worth 20 million dollars?

1211
01:22:49,036 --> 01:22:50,754
This castle's worth,

1212
01:22:50,836 --> 01:22:52,713
l'd say, more like...

1213
01:22:52,796 --> 01:22:54,867
seven, seven and a half.

1214
01:23:04,839 --> 01:23:06,158
(Whistle)

1215
01:23:07,479 --> 01:23:09,436
Do you want to see the game?

1216
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,358
# Easy come

1217
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,114

# Watch the world flow

1219
01:23:37,405 --> 01:23:40,125
Mr McElroy,

1220
01:23:40,206 --> 01:23:43,324
you are a genuine McElroy like myself,
you say.

1221
01:23:43,407 --> 01:23:46,046
This is the tartan of my slave master.

1222
01:23:46,127 --> 01:23:50,121

1224
01:23:52,248 --> 01:23:55,525
- But will you not now be making your putt?
- Aye

1225
01:24:03,931 --> 01:24:08,847
Congratulations, Mr McElroy.
An outstanding round of golf.

1226
01:24:08,932 --> 01:24:10,888
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1227
01:24:16,013 --> 01:24:17,970
Well!

1228
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:21,126
l can tell you, it's the first time
that's been seen on the 1 8th green.

1229

# Everything good is bad
