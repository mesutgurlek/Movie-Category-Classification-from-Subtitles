[Man Narrating]
In a time before
many can remember,

2
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,460
our planet faced
its greatest challenge.

3
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,464
A warlord named Piccolo
came from beyond the stars,

4
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,384
bringing darkness and chaos
to our once peaceful world.

5
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,845
Aided by his disciple Oozaru,

6
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,683
the evil pair brought
the human race to the brink
ofannihilation.

7
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,811
Cities and countries
crumbled beneath them.

8
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,481
Countless lives were lost.

9
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,317
But... finally,

10
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,112
a group of brave warriors
created the Ma Fu Ba,

11
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:16,825
a powerful enchantment
that imprisoned Piccolo
deep within the Earth.

12
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,915
With his master captured,
Oozaru disappeared,

13
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:27,086
and balance was
slowly restored to our world.

14
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,090
And so it has remained
for thousands ofyears,

15
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,175
until now.

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,892

17
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,019
there are no rules.

Yeah. Shadow Crane strike.
You fell for it again.

35
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,440
Well, it's kind of hard
to block a move that I can't see.

36
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:59,321
Goku, you rely too heavily
on your external senses.

37

To see, to hear, to touch...

38
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,243
are all overrated.

comes from inside.

Everybody at school treats me
like I'm nothing, Grandpa.

You're special, Goku.
No. I'm different.

I know that,
and they know that too.

that I want to explode.

tear them apart with one hand.

I don't train you to fight boys, Goku.
You promised.

Okay. You made me
promise not to fight.

I can use.

how to get the girl.

Teach me how to talk to her
without stumbling
all over everything I say.

Teach me how to be normal.

62

By itself, nothing.
But together,

[Weaver] A solar eclipse
is caused by the moon blocking
the sun from the Earth.

00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,518
Correct. From the dawn
ofcivilization,

solar eclipses as the sign
ofthe apocalypse.

the eclipse symbolizes Rahu,

00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,720
Let me handle this.

483
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,974
Oh! You are such a lifesaver.

484
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,018
We arejust stuck down here.

485
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,146
I'd be, uh, so grateful...

486
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,440
ifyou could just
help me and my friends out.

487
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,193
For a pretty thing like you?

488
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,821
No problemo.

489
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,991
Thankyou.
You're a real gentleman.

490
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,035
Yamcha, at your service.

491
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,162
I'm gonna need some payment.

492
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,664
- [Snickers]
- Payment?

493
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,334
Who do you think made this trap?
[Chuckles]

494
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:01,296
Wait a minute.
Is that a Capsule RX 550
Roadster I see down there?

495
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,465
Yo! I'll take that.

496
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,051
You're nothing
but a lowlife bandit.
Yeah.

497
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,387
But one with a ladder.
Just think it over,

498
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,432
'cause after the sun comes out,
it's gonna be hot, hot, hot.

499
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,559
[Chuckles]
Hot!

500
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,568
[Groans]
[Thuds]

501
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,653
Now all we need are marshmallows
and a ghost story.

502
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,990
We have no marshmallows,
but I do have a story.

503
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,992
2,000 years ago,

504
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,370
the Earth was nearly destroyed.

505
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,081
Not by man but by gods
from the sky.

506
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:46,007
Their names were
Piccolo and Oozaru.

507
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:50,261
Seven mystics banded together
to fight the invaders.

508
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:55,058
They sacrificed their lives
to cast the Ma Fu Ba,

509
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,103
a powerful curse
that imprisoned Piccolo.

510
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,732
Now, Piccolo has
somehow escaped.

511
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:07,070
In two days, the blood moon
will eclipse the sun...

512
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,532
and bring forth Oozaru,
his disciple.

513
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,450
To stop Piccolo,

514
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,662
whoever can find
all seven Dragonballs...

515
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,331
can resurrect
the power ofShen Long...

516
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,500
and be granted one perfect wish.

517
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,296
Unless we find
the Dragonballs...

518
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,925
and use our wish
to banish Piccolo from this world,

519
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:33,179
we will have no defense
against the onslaught.

520
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,974
What a crock.
[Chuckles]
You expect me to believe that?

521
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:41,020
I do not. I thinkyou
are the kind of person who
does not believe in anything.

522
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,772
I feel sorry foryou.

523
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,733
Yeah. Whatever.
I'm not the one
stuck in the hole.

524
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,278
Let us out! Now!
[Grunts]

525
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,114
[Gasps]
Whoa there, jumping bean.

526
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,700
One more outburst like that,
and I'm out of here.

527
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,785
[Beeping]

528
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,872
The Dragonball's close.

529
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,876
But I think
it's buried underground.

530
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,590
Enough games.
We have no time to waste.

531
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,592
- Send down a net.
- Hey, Rosh.

532
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,887
We're gonna need
some tools to excavate!

533
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,643
How would you like to make more money
than you ever dreamed of?

534
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,353
Nowyou're talking, bro.

535
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,398
Wh— Oh.

536
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:30,737
Lfthat D.B.E. Thing is right,
the ball you're looking for is
right here. Let's go. Come on!

537
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,120
You have no right to give away
a third ofthe royalties
to my invention.

538
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,664
One day Dragonballs
could power the world.

539
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:46,753
Don't worry.
A third ofzero is still zero.

540
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,971
Done. Whoo!
Ooh, yeah.

541
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,350
[Exhales]
Well, I guess
ifyou hadn't robbed us,

542
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,561
we wouldn't be able
to get this Dragonball.

543
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,898
Well, everything happens
for a reason, bro.

544
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,818
Got that one from daytime TV.
[Clicks Tongue]

545
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,167
- [Goku]
The Dragonball is close.
- [Roshi] Be on your guard.

546
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,920
Piccolo is also
after the Dragonball.

547
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,425
[Woman]
I followed Muten Roshi as directed.

548
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,512
He is training the boy...
San-Goku.

549
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,182
I could disrupt them.

550
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,855
No. This will require
more than a disruption.

551
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,443
[Roars]

552
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,698
Your blood will give it life.

553
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:02,787
[Roaring]

554
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,627
[Panting]

555
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:17,093
The Dragonballs
are within my grasp.

556
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:21,431
And with them,
the power to destroy this world.

557
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,890
[Roars]

558
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:35,153
So, after we get the seven Dragonballs,
how soon can I expect some profit?

559
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,530
Huh? A month?

560
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,490
A year?

561
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,492
[Beeping]
[Sighs]

562
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:45,038
High temps
are screwing with the signal.
I can't get a good read on it.

[Yelps]

566
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,557
- [Laughing]
- Oh! But I see it.

567
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,729
[Goku]
The problem is
how to get across.

568
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,440
Come on!

569
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,525

- [Shouts]

579
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,686
Into the lava!
That's the only way
to stop them!

00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,383
Master Roshi,
the Dragonballs.

600
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,011
They've been speaking to you.
Yeah.

601
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,807
They are showing you a future.
There's this demon—

602
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,351
Oozaru. The Destroyer.

603
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,230
He will kill you.

604
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,566
And Bulma. And Yamcha.

605
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,945
He will destroy everything.

606
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,491
The future's always changing.

607
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,536
Let the dragon show you his lessons.

608
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,917
I need to somehow
defeat Oozaru.

609
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,891
The eclipse is in two days.
We'll never find the other
Dragonballs in time.

610
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,644
There is another way
to stop Piccolo.

611
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,313
The only chance
the world has now...

612
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,483
is in Toisan.

613

How is my favorite skeptic?

618
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,196
I come to apologize,
Sifu Norris.

619
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,658
Everything that
I questioned before...

620
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,164
I now know is all true.

621
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,376
The prophecy.

622
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:46,130
The blood moon will eclipse
the sun tomorrow.

623
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,346
I need your help.

624

I need another

The Ma Fu Ba?

That will consume
all ofyour life forces.

627
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,315
When you put it that way,
the plan sucks.

Mmm.

It's the only way.

I'm the only one
who can do it.

by the morning.

[Gong Resounds]
[Cheering]

642
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,326
[Male Announcer]
The winner by concession— red.

643

[Female Announcer

644
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,794
Goku!
Whoa!

645
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,839
You made it.
Yeah. Wh-What's this?

646
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,841
[Male Announcer]
Watanabe versus Tanaka.
Are you okay?

647
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,802
Uh, yeah. It's nothing.
Are you in the tournament?

648
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,804
No, I'm here
for something else.

649
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,806
Something more important
than me?

650
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,310
Actually, you're one ofthe reasons
why it's so important.

651
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,314
[Bulma]
I've got a confession
to make.

652
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,734
I wanted to be famous.
[Scoffs]

653
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,944
I wanted to be rich.
[Chuckles]

654
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,530
Well, neither of us are gonna
get what we wanted.

655
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,745
Look at these people.
[Electronic Beeping]

656
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,497
They have no idea.
Yeah.

657
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,459
[Yamcha]
I wish I didn't know myself.

658
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,172
Never thought I could
enjoy talking to a thief.
[Chuckles]

659
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,384
You know,

660
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,720
I'm not so bad
once you get to know me.

661
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,848
Maybe I like bad men.

662
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,813
That's good to know
on the day before
the end ofthe world.

[Man] Hey!
[Shouting In Chinese]
[Wings Flapping]

665
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,240
Hey.

666
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,451
We still have our Dragonballs.

667
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,913
That's right.
Piccolo needs all seven.

668
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,915
He still can't make
his wish either.

669
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,917
And that means you can
still make your 30%.

670
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,086
Wh—
Thirty-three and a third!

671
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,505
Don't push it.
No, 33 and a third!

672

[Air Whooshes]

673
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,244
The final level
ofair-bending technique...

674
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,955
is the Kame Hame Ha.

675
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,957
Yeah. My grandpa
told me about that.

676
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,543
But he said that I wasn't
ready to learn it yet.

677
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,254
You are not.
Okay.

678
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,881
But time is running out.

679
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:20,261
To master the Kame Hame Ha,
you have to masteryour ki.

680
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,930
Draw the power
ofthe universe.

[Whooshing]

688
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,544
Focus it.

689
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,630
Then release!

690
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,800
What?

691
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:07,308
The more you put yourself
into the Kame Hame Ha,
the greater the power.

692
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:10,561
Practice. Light the torches
in the courtyard.

693
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:13,439
I will see you in the morning.
Mm-hmm.

694
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,500
[Whooshes]

[Whooshing]

00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,571
That's cheating.

701
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,698
You're supposed to light
the torches with your ki.

702
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,492
Have you been watching me?

703
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,914
- Then I guess you know why
I have to cheat.

[Blows, Groans]

705
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,839
You know, my grandpa
always said in order to master my ki,

706
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:26,095
I have to be at one
with myselfand with my enemy.

707
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,722
I still don't know
what that means.

708
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,474
Maybe you need an incentive.

709
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,851
Whoa.

710
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,980
There are five unlit torches
in this courtyard.

711
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,148
You're five paces
away from me.

712
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,526
Every time you light a torch,

713
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,904
you get to take
one step closer to me.

714
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,825
What happens after I light
all five torches?

715
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:51,203
[Clears Throat]
Then you'll be standing
right next to me—

716
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,290
where I can reach you.

00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,208
You're on.

[Whooshing]

719
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,217
Very impressive.

00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,196
All right.

[Whooshing]

726
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,293
Take one step back.

[Groans]
It doesn't feel right.
I must be missing something.

732
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,981
You have to make
every move your own.

733
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,735
You can do this.

734
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,447
Well—

I think the next move,

739
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,968
it would be better
to blow out all the torches.

01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:45,414
I would never do that
on purpose. It wasjust—

969
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,084
I was in the heat of battle,
and I thought you were
someone else—

970
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:50,127
It's all right.
I let you hit me.

971
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,589
I wasjust too fast.
You're fast,

972
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:57,051
but I let you hit me.
Well, it was dark and confusing.

973
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:59,053
I wasn't holding back.

974
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:01,347
Okay. Ifour relationship
is gonna go anywhere,

975
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:03,599
we're gonna have
to settle this.
