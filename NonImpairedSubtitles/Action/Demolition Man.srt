1
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:55,288
Remember when they let
commercial airlines land in this town?

2
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:57,522
I don't understand where we're going...

3
00:00:57,612 --> 00:00:59,682
...or why we're bothering anyhow.

4
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,764
-You're doing a good deed.
-Give us a better reason.

5
00:01:03,172 --> 00:01:06,847
A maniac hijacked a municipal bus
with 30 passengers on it.

6
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:10,648
I got a hunch where those passengers are
and who that maniac is.

7
00:01:10,732 --> 00:01:12,085
Share it with us.

8
00:01:12,692 --> 00:01:13,681
Phoenix.

9
00:01:14,252 --> 00:01:15,446
Simon Phoenix.

10
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:53,128
Send a maniac to catch one.

11
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:56,327
Phoenix!

12
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:07,684
Don't move, Phoenix.

13
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:12,611
You're under arrest.

14
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:14,731
Arrest? Shit.

15
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:17,130
And you're trespassing.

16
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:19,765
Where are the passengers?

17
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:21,808
Oh, yes, the passengers.

18
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,451
Well, they're....

19
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:25,686
Fuck you.

20
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,569
The passengers are gone.

21
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:31,368
See, I told the city,
"Look, nobody comes down here."

22
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:33,610
Postmen figured it out...

23
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:35,285
...policemen figured it out.

24
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:38,523
But the goddamn bus drivers
just wouldn't listen.

25
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:40,850
Last time, Phoenix.

26
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,123
Where are the hostages?

27
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:46,369
To hell with the hostages!
This is between you and me!

28
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:52,087
What you got?

29
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:53,207
Do something.

30
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,520
Go ahead.

31
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,522
You're up to your ass in gasoline.

32
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,569
I'll set your ass on fire.

33
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,685
Is it cold in here...

34
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:18,891
...or is it just me?

35
00:04:49,812 --> 00:04:51,211
Where are they, Phoenix?

36
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,964
Now, where did I put them?

37
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,369
I swear, I'd lose my head
if it wasn't attached.

38
00:04:57,652 --> 00:04:59,563
I'll keep that in mind.

39
00:05:39,412 --> 00:05:42,449
Damn it, I'm tired
of this "demolition-man" shit!

40
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:45,042
You were not supposed
to come down here!

41
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:48,568
You were not supposed to attempt
the arrest of Phoenix alone...

42
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:50,245
...or to blow anything up!

43
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:53,369
It wasn't me! He dumped the gas
and rigged the place to blow!

44
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,044
Right, you weren't involved.

45
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:57,646
I know you've tried
to nail this psycho for years.

46
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,609
But remember a thing called...

47
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:01,444
...official police procedure?

48
00:06:01,532 --> 00:06:03,409
-Where are the hostages?
-They're not here.

49
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:04,163
What?

50
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:06,083
He must've stashed them someplace else!

51
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:07,969
Are you sure they weren't in there?

52
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:11,442
I did a thermo check and there were eight
of them, all part of his gang.

53
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:12,647
Wrong again!

54
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:14,484
You got something to say?

55
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:16,851
Get him out of here!

56
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:18,601
Motherfucker!

57
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,842
We are going to have a chat.

58
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:22,647
Captain!

59
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:25,967
Over here! There're bodies everywhere!

60
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:27,571
There must be 20 or 30.

61
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:29,085
They're everywhere.

62
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:31,765
See that? I told him!

63
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,604
He said he didn't care!

64
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:37,487
How could you sacrifice
all those innocent people for me!

65
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:39,930
What kind of man are you?

66
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:43,209
We'll spend a lot of quality time together.
'Bye, sweetie!

67
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,771
Honey! Sugar!

68
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,002
If you got a lawyer, better call him.

69
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:45,488
John Spartan, you've done great deeds
for Los Angeles.

70
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,049
So, it is with some regret that l,
William Smithers...

71
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:52,562
...acting as Assistant Warden,
hereby carry out this sentence.

72
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:54,040
Skip it.

73
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:57,122
You've been sentenced to 70 years...

74
00:07:57,212 --> 00:08:01,285
...sub-zero re-habilitation
in the California Cryo-Penitentiary...

75
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:04,803
...for the involuntary manslaughter
of 30 civilians.

76
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:06,287
Skip it.

77
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:09,688
You'll be placed in cryo-stasis
for the duration of your sentence...

78
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:13,162
...and your behavior will be altered
through synaptic suggestion.

79
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:16,562
You'll be eligible for parole
no earlier than the year 2046.

80
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:26,201
I'm sorry.

81
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:22,806
All personnel...

82
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:26,362
...the next scheduled parole hearing
for prisoner Gilmour...

83
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:28,448
...will take place at 07:15.

84
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:33,367
Warden William Smithers
report to Level A, conference room.

85
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:40,805
Mellow greetings.

86
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,886
Be well, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

87
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:46,484
As it is a beautiful...

88
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:50,201
...Monday morning and as my duty log
irrationally requires it...

89
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:52,932
...l'm querying you
on the prison population.

90
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,684
Does the tedium continue?

91
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:57,406
Your question is amusing but irrelevant.

92
00:11:57,532 --> 00:12:00,092
The prisoners are ice cubes.
They never move.

93
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:03,730
I find this lack of stimulus
to be truly disappointing.

94
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:05,484
-Don't you think?
-I try not to.

95
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:07,802
You're young, think all you want.

96
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:10,884
Things don't happen anymore,
we've taken care of all that.

97
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:13,691
I'll fiber-op you back
after the parole hearings.

98
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,285
Have a peachy day.

99
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:16,441
Be well.

100
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,442
Be well.

101
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:18,885
Vector 137.

102
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,361
Upcoming, Santa Monica Boulevard.

103
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:28,010
Retina coding accepted.

104
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:30,163
Warden Smithers, be well.

105
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:31,607
Go on.

106
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:40,407
Self-drive on.

107
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,210
Self-drive engaged.

108
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:43,891
Coding on.

109
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:47,767
No police presence is requested
in the city at this time.

110
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:49,047
Report to the station.

111
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:50,963
Oh, boy, how exciting.

112
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,207
That's it.

113
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,044
"Food, glorious food. "

114
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,085
There'll be another in 12 hours.

115
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:32,447
These assholes are predictable.

116
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,291
God, I hate this place!

117
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:35,964
There's not enough of us, Friendly.

118
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:37,963
That doesn't really matter anymore.

119
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:39,371
People are hungry.

120
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,283
We've nothing to lose.

121
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:55,846
Greetings.

122
00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:57,491
Lovely Lenina.

123
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:02,688
Greetings, welcome
to the emergency line of the SAPD.

124
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:06,410
If you prefer an automated response,
press one now.

125
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:07,800
Be well.

126
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:12,963
Mellow greetings, Lenina Huxley.

127
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,963
Let me guess, all is serene?

128
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:17,845
On the contrary, it's been a horrific a.m.

129
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:20,322
Public buildings were defaced.

130
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,289
Walls smudged with...

131
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:24,324
...scandalous graffiti.

132
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:25,447
Really?

133
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:28,445
Brutal. Why wasn't there
an "all-cars notify"?

134
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:32,008
Because there was no need
to create widespread panic.

135
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:34,724
Lieutenant Huxley...

136
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:37,770
...l monitored your disheartening
and distressing comments...

137
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:39,683
...to the warden this morning.

138
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:42,650
Do you really long for chaos
and disharmony?

139
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:47,087
Your fascination with the 20th century
is affecting your judgment.

140
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,766
You realize you're setting a bad example
for other officers and personnel.

141
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:54,412
Thank you for the attitude readjustment.

142
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:56,210
Info assimilated.

143
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,284
Sanctimonious asshole.

144
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:08,012
Lenina Huxley, you are fined 1/2 credit...

145
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:11,050
...for a 'sotto voce' violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

146
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,451
Thank you.

147
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:20,486
That was tense.

148
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:22,325
That was tense?

149
00:15:24,332 --> 00:15:28,484
Don't you get bored code tracing perps
who break curfew and tell dirty jokes?

150
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,923
I find my job deeply fulfilling.

151
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:35,207
I just can't get over the reality
of this office, Lenina.

152
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:38,047
You're still addicted to the 20th century.

153
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:41,283
High from its harshness.
Buzzed by its brutality.

154
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,091
Holy smokes!

155
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:47,765
Is there anything in this office which
doesn't violate Contraband Ordinance 22?

156
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:49,126
Only you.

157
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:53,081
Don't you ever want something to happen?

158
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:55,480
Goodness, no.

159
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:57,924
I knew you'd say that.

160
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:02,722
What I wouldn't give for some action.

161
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:14,764
Mr. Simon Phoenix.

162
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:18,526
One of our first
and most illustrious members.

163
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:20,967
Allow me...

164
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:23,845
...to welcome you to your parole hearing.

165
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:26,043
Let's get this over quickly.

166

Stop it!

170
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:51,805
Do you have anything fresh to say
on your behalf?

171
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,606
I thought not.

172
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,128

177
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:25,724

188
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:26,045

00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:50,091
Play ball!

332
00:26:57,852 --> 00:27:00,161
We've lost every camera for six blocks.

333
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:04,447
Go to Century City, 1200 millimeters.

334
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:14,720
He's going for the vehicle's battery coil.

335
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:17,050
It's pure capacitance gel.

336
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:29,764
The problem is not the defacement
ofpublic buildings or...

337
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:33,208
...the noise pollution caused
by the exploding devices.

338
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:34,890
Allow me to explain.

339
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:38,364
The real problem lies
in the man whose initials...

340
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:40,762
...mark the detonating graffiti...

341
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:43,601
...on the streets of our peaceful city.

342
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:45,849
The man behind the "E.F."...

343
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:48,530
...Mr. Edgar Friendly.

344
00:27:50,492 --> 00:27:52,881
For a sadly extended period of time...

345
00:27:53,212 --> 00:27:54,884
...we in San Angeles...

346
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:58,203
...have been plagued by a pack
of subterranean hooligans.

347
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:02,041
You will come to know them as "scraps."

348
00:28:02,172 --> 00:28:05,767
Men and women who have left the comfort
of our society...

349
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:07,684
...only to spew hostility...

350
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:10,650
...at the very bosom
they have relinquished.

351
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:14,368
There was a time when we used
to look upon these scraps...

352
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:17,251
...as rather pathetic
and relatively harmless.

353
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:19,884
Now they have a leader.

354
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:23,090
Mr. Friendly seems relentless
in his ambition...

355
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:25,925
...to infect our harmony with his venom.

356
00:28:26,532 --> 00:28:28,204
He must, of course...

357
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:29,731
...be stopped.

358
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:33,689
This radical terrorist behavior,
led by Mr. Friendly...

359
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:36,525
...must not be allowed
to undermine our safety.

360
00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:40,565
"Safety Above All."

361
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:44,245
I expect your trust,
confidence and certitude.

362
00:28:45,532 --> 00:28:46,681
Excuse me.

363
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:51,046
Dr. Cocteau...

364
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:54,841
...a cryo-con has effected self-release
from the penitentiary.

365
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:59,291
It's quite horrific. MurderDeathKills,
all categories of chaos.

366
00:28:59,492 --> 00:29:00,891
Enhance your calm.

367
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:06,924
"Be well" them for me.

368
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:14,325
Get me Captain George Earle immediately.

369
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:17,805
It was just....

370
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:20,366
It was so....

371
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:24,201
How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?

372
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:26,044
It was fun for him.

373
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:30,366
Do everything in your power
to snare this agent of destruction.

374
00:29:30,532 --> 00:29:32,523
You have my utmost confidence.

375
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,609
It will be done, Dr. Cocteau.

376
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,047
Be well.

377
00:29:42,692 --> 00:29:44,444
"Utmost confidence."

378
00:29:45,732 --> 00:29:47,563
"Everything in our power."

379
00:29:51,412 --> 00:29:52,845
What else is there?

380
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:55,611
Zachary Lamb...

381
00:29:56,092 --> 00:29:59,880
...how was the fiendish Phoenix
apprehended back in the 20th?

382
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:02,409
Twelve-state manhunt.

383
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:04,643
Satellite surveillance.

384
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:07,720
A video bite on Unsolved Mysteries.

385
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:10,284
None of them worked.

386
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:12,928
In the end, it took just one man.

387
00:30:13,092 --> 00:30:14,320
One cop.

388
00:30:15,252 --> 00:30:16,685
John Spartan.

389
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:18,247
John Spartan?

390
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:19,731
That's right.

391
00:30:19,932 --> 00:30:22,321
They called him the "Demolition Man."

392
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:24,763
Spartan file 98345, LAPD.

393
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,488
Spartan file 98761C, LAPD.

394
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,362
Are you sure this is real life?

395
00:30:36,532 --> 00:30:37,726
Barely.

396
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:39,200
Spartan's a legend.

397
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:43,285
I've been doing a historical study.
Over 1,000 arrests over three years.

398
00:30:43,452 --> 00:30:45,408
All authentic criminals.

399
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:47,927
There was a lot more business back then.

400
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,004
How can youjustify
destroying a $7 million mini mall...

401
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:53,811
...to rescue a girl
whose ransom is only $25,000?

402
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:55,245
Fuck you, lady.

403
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:56,846
Good answer.

404
00:30:57,892 --> 00:30:59,883
This is your recommendation?

405
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:02,202
The Demolition Man's an animal.

406
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:06,764
He's clearly the man for a job such as this.
You could reinstate him.

407
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:09,403
He's a muscle-bound grotesque...

408
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:12,681
...who hasn't worn a shield in 40 years.

409
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:15,650
Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned criminal.

410
00:31:15,812 --> 00:31:17,643
We need an old-fashioned cop.

411
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:44,682
Cryo-fac 312-618 is ready
for routine maintenance and inspection.

412
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:06,090
John Spartan, 5864.

413
00:32:07,252 --> 00:32:09,812
Pulmonary activity approaching normal.

414
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:12,361
Body temperature, 63% and rising.

415
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:15,564
Biolink engaged.

416
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:19,172
Laser defibrillation sequence started.

417
00:32:20,052 --> 00:32:22,282
Plasma transfer in 15 seconds.

418
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:26,362
Plasma transfer, 10 seconds...

419
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:28,206
...8 seconds...

420
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,046
...6 seconds....

421
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:33,563
Plasma transfer complete.

422
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:36,125
MTL complete.

423
00:32:56,212 --> 00:32:58,282
Hunting down an escaped cryo-con...

424
00:32:58,612 --> 00:33:00,443
...by releasing another one?

425
00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:02,365
I am unconvinced.

426
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:04,841
It's within the powers of the police charter.

427
00:33:04,932 --> 00:33:08,607
He can be released on limited parole
and reinstated to active duty.

428
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:11,286
It's not enough to collect the '90s?

429
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,961
Cocteau said everything in our power.

430
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:15,565
I can't think of a better idea.

431
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:17,722
That doesn't mean it's a good one.

432
00:33:19,172 --> 00:33:22,687
This man comes from a dissimilar method
of law enforcement.

433
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:25,969
I'm not sure he's any different
than Simon Phoenix himself.

434
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:27,121
Detective?

435
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:32,202
I am Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

436
00:33:32,852 --> 00:33:34,490
The year is 2032.

437
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:37,881
The reason you have been released is--

438
00:33:38,052 --> 00:33:39,804
How long have I been under?

439
00:33:41,972 --> 00:33:43,325
Thirty-six years.

440
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:47,805
I had a wife.

441
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:50,049
What happened to my wife?

442
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:54,563
Her light was extinguished
in the Big One of 2010.

443
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:00,846
She died.

444
00:34:01,812 --> 00:34:03,450
In an earthquake.

445
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:05,485
The earthquake.

446
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:09,405
I had a daughter.

447
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,525
What happened to her?

448
00:34:12,612 --> 00:34:13,647
John Spartan.

449
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:15,802
I am Chief of Police George Earle.

450
00:34:15,892 --> 00:34:18,452
We didn't thaw you out
for a family reunion.

451
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:23,245
Consider it fortunate that the lieutenant
did a probe on your wife.

452
00:34:23,412 --> 00:34:25,972
This is about you
and the cryo-con Simon Phoenix.

453
00:34:26,052 --> 00:34:27,087
What?

454
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:31,724
Today Simon Phoenix escaped from
this cryo-facility. We've had 1 1 murders...

455
00:34:31,892 --> 00:34:32,927
...so far.

456
00:34:33,892 --> 00:34:37,009
You see, we've become a society
of peace-loving...

457
00:34:37,172 --> 00:34:40,448
...and understanding and we are,
quite frankly, not equipped...

458
00:34:40,532 --> 00:34:42,124
...to deal with this situation.

459
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:46,046
There's been no deaths of unnatural causes
in San Angeles for 16 years.

460
00:34:46,212 --> 00:34:47,247
Where?

461
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:51,530
The Santa Barbara, Los Angeles,
San Diego Metroplex merged in 201 1 .

462
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:53,688
You are in what used to be LA.

463
00:34:55,252 --> 00:34:56,446
That's great.

464
00:34:57,892 --> 00:35:00,281
-You, get me a Marlboro.
-Yes, of course.

465
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:03,406
What's a Marlboro?

466
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:05,562
It's a cigarette. Any cigarette.

467
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:10,686
Smoking is not good for you.
Anything not good for you is bad.

468
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:15,121
Hence, illegal. Alcohol, caffeine,
contact sports, meat--

469
00:35:15,332 --> 00:35:16,685
Are you shitting me?

470
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:21,050
You are fined one credit for violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

471
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:23,803
What the hell is that?

472
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:26,770
-You are fined one credit....
-Bad language...

473
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:30,368
...chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys
and spicy food.

474
00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:34,047
Abortion is illegal, so is pregnancy
if you don't have a license.

475
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,201
Caveman...

476
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:38,290
...let's finish with the Rip Van Winkle
and get moving.

477
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:40,761
Our Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes.

478
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:45,002
I tracked that dirtbag for two years...

479
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:48,846
...and when I finally bring him down
you turn me into an ice cube.

480
00:35:49,252 --> 00:35:50,765
Thanks, but no thanks.

481
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:54,288
The conditions of your parole
are full reinstatement into the SAPD...

482
00:35:54,372 --> 00:35:57,648
...and immediate assignment
to the apprehension of Phoenix.

483
00:35:57,812 --> 00:35:58,767
Or...

484
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:03,001
...you can go back into cryo-stasis.

485
00:36:03,332 --> 00:36:06,130
Not many people get a second chance,
John Spartan.

486
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:16,882
Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix?

487
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:19,361
There is nothing, Lenina Huxley.

488
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,371
Where's Spartan?

489
00:36:21,852 --> 00:36:25,288
He went to the bathroom.
I guess he got all thawed out.

490
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:31,482
I formally convey my presence.

491
00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:35,251
How are you doing?

492
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:38,172
We're not used
to physical-contact greetings.

493
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:39,926
I don't know...

494
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:41,843
...if you guys know it but...

495
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:44,803
...you're out of toilet paper.

496
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:47,924
Did you say "toilet paper"?

497
00:36:49,852 --> 00:36:52,446
They used handfuls of wadded paper...

498
00:36:52,812 --> 00:36:54,564
...back in the 20th.

499
00:36:56,892 --> 00:37:00,248
I'm happy you're happy,
but in place of toilet paper...

500
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:02,972
...you've got a shelf with three seashells.

501
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:06,892
He doesn't know how to use the seashells.

502
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:12,565
I can see how that'd be confusing.

503
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:15,120
I don't believe it. Is that you, Spartan?

504
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:21,731
Zach Lamb?

505
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,405
What happened to you?

506
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:27,011
I got older.

507
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:29,920
My God, I remember when you were...

508
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,560
...a rookie pilot.

509
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:33,529
They finally grounded me.

510
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:36,081
Shit, you were a damn good flyer.

511
00:37:36,612 --> 00:37:40,890
You're fined two credits for violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

512
00:37:41,212 --> 00:37:42,930
I'll be right back.

513
00:37:43,252 --> 00:37:44,844
They seem to be friends, yet...

514
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:47,241
...he speaks to him
in the most profane manner.

515
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:51,644
If you'd read my study, you'd know
this is how heterosexual men bonded.

516
00:37:51,972 --> 00:37:53,371
I knew that.

517
00:37:53,692 --> 00:37:57,605
Thanks a lot you shit-brained,
fuck-faced, ball-breaking, duck-fucking...

518
00:37:58,852 --> 00:38:01,286
-...pain in the ass.
-You're fined five credits...

519
00:38:01,372 --> 00:38:04,011
...for repeated violations
of the verbal-morality statute.

520
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:05,844
So much for the seashells.

521
00:38:06,252 --> 00:38:08,243
See you in a few minutes.

522
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:14,002
Voice check, Lenina Huxley.

523
00:38:14,332 --> 00:38:16,892
Unfortunately Simon Phoenix
was not coded.

524
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:19,691
While you were sleeping
a code was installed on everyone.

525
00:38:19,772 --> 00:38:23,685
It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau.
An organic microchip...

526
00:38:23,932 --> 00:38:25,126
...is sewn into the skin.

527
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:28,329
Sensors all over the city
can zero in on anyone at any time.

528
00:38:28,412 --> 00:38:32,087
I can't even conceive of what
police officers did before it was developed.

529
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:35,164
We worked. This fascist crap
makes me want to puke.

530
00:38:35,332 --> 00:38:37,482
What do you think you're scratching?

531
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:40,731
You really think we'd let you go
without control?

532
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:43,121
Your code was implanted
when you were thawed.

533
00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:45,601
Why not just shove a leash up my ass?

534
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,524
You dirty meat-eater!

535
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,328
No matter how Viking your era was...

536
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:53,324
...l cannot digest how
you ever wore a badge!

537
00:38:53,452 --> 00:38:56,285
You're going back, John Spartan,
you're going back!

538
00:38:56,372 --> 00:38:59,045
Could you two please
dump some hormones?

539
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:01,362
We need every cortex we can get here.

540
00:39:01,452 --> 00:39:03,283
We don't need the Neanderthal.

541
00:39:03,372 --> 00:39:06,091
Our computer has already examined
every scenario...

542
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:08,606
...resulting from the appearance
of Simon Phoenix.

543
00:39:08,692 --> 00:39:12,480
It's determined he'll try to set up
a drug lab and form a crime syndicate.

544
00:39:12,572 --> 00:39:14,164
That is correct.

545
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:17,043
I hate to interrupt you two...

546
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:18,810
...but that's fucking stupid.

547
00:39:18,892 --> 00:39:21,087
You think he wants to start a business?

548
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:23,003
Phoenix is going for a gun.

549
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:24,565
Plain and simple.

550
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:26,326
Trust me.

551
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:27,801
He's going for a gun.

552
00:39:27,892 --> 00:39:30,167
Who cares what this primate thinks?

553
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,170
Resonate some understanding.

554
00:39:32,252 --> 00:39:35,608
The only place a person
can even view a gun in this city...

555
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:37,771
...is at a museum.

556
00:39:43,892 --> 00:39:46,850
Welcome to the San Angeles Museum
of History.

557
00:39:47,612 --> 00:39:49,807
Beneath you is an excavation...

558
00:39:49,892 --> 00:39:52,770
...of an actual 20th-century street scene...

559
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:56,681
...in downtown Los Angeles,
preserved since the earthquake of 2010.

560
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:02,407
For specific information
on objects featured in the exhibit....

561
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:05,086
Firearms are displayed in the Armory...

562
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:07,123
...located on Level A.

563
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:12,131
You are entering the Hall of Violence...

564
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:15,841
...a visual representation
of the primitive behavior prevalent...

565
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:18,321
...during the late 20th century.

566
00:40:18,972 --> 00:40:20,610
Home, sweet home.

567
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:28,484
John Spartan, even if Simon Phoenix
was able to locate the cache of firearms...

568
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:30,688
...it'd be impossible to remove them.

569
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:34,321
She's right. They're located
in a maximum-security armory exhibit.

570
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:36,721
It's just a hunch. Trust me on this.

571
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:38,325
It's a cop thing.

572
00:40:38,492 --> 00:40:40,050
And what am l, a frog?

573
00:40:42,132 --> 00:40:43,451
Excuse me.

574
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,006
I'll drive.

575
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:52,005
Resetting all bio-links for new driver.

576
00:40:52,252 --> 00:40:54,527
Weight, height, peripheral vision set.

577
00:40:54,892 --> 00:40:56,484
Ifyou would like...

578
00:40:56,652 --> 00:41:00,884
...to commence transportation,
John Spartan, initialize sequence now.

579
00:41:01,332 --> 00:41:02,651
You drive.

580
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,643
Welcome, Lenina Huxley.

581
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:23,524
You seem very much alone,
John Spartan, but...

582
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:25,842
...things aren't all that different.

583
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:28,241
Perhaps you'd like to hear
an oldies station?

584
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,288
"Oh, what a relief it is. "

585
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,642
This is the town's most popular station.

586
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:35,292
Wall-to-wall mini-tunes.
You called them "commercials."

587
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:37,442
The classic you've been waiting for.

588
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:40,330
The number one request:
"Armour Hot Dogs. "

589
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,043
"Kids eat Armour Hot Dogs.... "

590
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:44,844
This is my fave!

591
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,328
"Skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks

592
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:50,165
"Tall kids, sissy kids, even kids with...

593
00:41:50,412 --> 00:41:52,004
"...chicken pox love hot dogs

594
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,684
"Armour Hot Dogs

595
00:41:54,132 --> 00:41:56,327
"The dogs kids love to bite. "

596
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:05,486
Someone put me back in the fridge.

597
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:10,086
You are entering the armory exhibit.

598
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:13,729
Here you will find displays
in the cabinets and walls....

599
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:16,121
So sorry. Didn't see you there.

600
00:42:18,132 --> 00:42:19,485
Sweet baby.

601
00:42:21,852 --> 00:42:23,080
Oh, shit.

602
00:42:32,212 --> 00:42:34,123
This is what I'm talking about.

603
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:36,125
How do I get in here?

604
00:42:36,532 --> 00:42:40,320
Is there a 15-day waiting period?
Or can I just take one now?

605
00:42:42,012 --> 00:42:43,445
Motherfucker.

606
00:42:49,132 --> 00:42:50,531
Oh, fuck it.

607
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:52,285
Mellow greetings.

608
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:54,404
What seems to be your boggle?

609
00:42:54,492 --> 00:42:55,811
My "boggle"?

610
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:02,770
How much do you weigh?

611
00:43:03,252 --> 00:43:04,321
I weigh--

612
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:13,846
Please vacate the museum, patrons.

613
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,281
Be calm.

614
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:17,564
Please vacate...

615
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:20,087
...the museum, patrons. Be calm.

616
00:43:20,252 --> 00:43:22,686
Wait a minute, this is the future.

617
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:24,768
Where are all the phaser guns?

618
00:43:29,812 --> 00:43:31,325
Mellow greetings, sir.

619
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:33,004
What's your boggle?

620
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:41,442
Warning, please exit rapidly.

621
00:43:41,532 --> 00:43:44,922
The magnetic accelerator gun,
the last hand-held weapon...

622
00:43:45,012 --> 00:43:48,004
...of this millennium,
displaced the flow of neutrons...

623
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:51,528
...through a nonlinear cycloid
electromagnetic accumulator.

624
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:53,570
So, what? It needs batteries?

625
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:56,689
What size? Where the fuck
do you find batteries?

626
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:58,609
Is there a battery store around here?

627
00:43:58,692 --> 00:44:00,523
Excuse me, patron. Can l--

628
00:44:02,772 --> 00:44:04,364
Where's Radio Shack?

629
00:44:10,452 --> 00:44:12,090
Sweet music to my ears.

630
00:44:12,412 --> 00:44:16,451
Activated, the magnetic accelerator gun
will achieve fusion in 2.6 minutes.

631
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:20,686
I was thinking about leaving quickly.
Patience is not one of my virtues.

632
00:44:32,812 --> 00:44:34,131
Did you see that?

633
00:44:34,212 --> 00:44:35,167
What?

634
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:38,403
Never mind. I give up trying
to figure this place out.

635
00:44:39,212 --> 00:44:41,601
Excuse me, Rambo. I need to borrow this.

636
00:44:46,612 --> 00:44:48,648
Access and correlate procedure.

637
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:51,121
Establish communication with intruder.

638
00:44:51,252 --> 00:44:52,321
Wrong.

639
00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:55,290
-Luke Skywalker, use the Force.
-Oh, dear.

640
00:44:55,532 --> 00:44:58,524
-What the hell is this?
-It's a glow-rod. It's what we got.

641
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,761
Does it work?

642
00:45:03,612 --> 00:45:04,806
Guess so.

643
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:06,690
He's trapped in Section 8.

644
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:08,888
I doubt it. Make sure the building's clear.

645
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,371
Done. I want a visual.

646
00:45:10,452 --> 00:45:13,888
Every corridor of the museum,
I want full sensors routed to me.

647
00:45:16,572 --> 00:45:19,040
You guys wait here. Give me 10 minutes.

648
00:45:20,212 --> 00:45:23,409
Museum patron,
you are now confined to the armory.

649
00:45:26,172 --> 00:45:29,369
Museum patron, you are now confined
to the Armory.

650
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:37,481
The armory exhibit is now sealed.

651
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:42,046
All museum patrons still in the facility
should remain calm.

652
00:45:43,372 --> 00:45:45,010
Help is imminent.

653
00:45:48,732 --> 00:45:51,041
This museum is no longer sealed.

654
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:54,247
What can I say? I'm a blast from the past.

655
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:56,084
You should've stayed there.

656
00:45:56,332 --> 00:45:58,766
That voice sounds familiar. Who is that?

657
00:46:02,572 --> 00:46:04,210
Bad aim, Blondie.

658
00:46:04,372 --> 00:46:05,805
John Spartan?

659
00:46:06,132 --> 00:46:09,442
They let anybody into this century!
What're you doing here?

660
00:46:12,972 --> 00:46:14,371
Simon says: bleed!

661
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:18,565
Great. Just great.

662
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,410
You're making it too easy.

663
00:46:20,532 --> 00:46:22,602
Come on, you piece of shit!

664
00:46:23,452 --> 00:46:24,805
Let me get this right.

665
00:46:24,892 --> 00:46:28,487
They defrosted you just
so you could lasso my piddly ass?

666
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:32,805
I've dreamed about killing you for 40 years.

667
00:46:35,372 --> 00:46:36,851
Keep dreaming!

668
00:47:33,732 --> 00:47:35,643
Magnetic accelerator activated.

669
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:36,926
About time.

670
00:47:37,012 --> 00:47:38,161
Past is over!

671
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:39,930
Time for something new and improved!

672
00:47:40,012 --> 00:47:41,286
Oh, hell.

673
00:47:45,652 --> 00:47:47,404
Shit! I love this gun!

674
00:47:54,252 --> 00:47:56,049
How do you like the future?

675
00:48:07,532 --> 00:48:08,647
Come on!

676
00:48:16,372 --> 00:48:17,202
That must hurt!

677
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:18,930
Huh, Soldier Boy?

678
00:48:20,452 --> 00:48:21,487
You're on TV!

679
00:48:21,572 --> 00:48:22,607
Shit!

680
00:48:29,692 --> 00:48:30,727
You're dead!

681
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:32,689
Forgot to say: "Simon says."

682
00:48:37,612 --> 00:48:38,601
Oh, shit.

683
00:48:38,692 --> 00:48:39,966
Good one.

684
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:44,724
Sorry, you must go!

685
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:45,967
Shit!

686
00:49:15,012 --> 00:49:18,322
Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans.

687
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:21,761
Someone will pay dearly for this.

688
00:49:25,492 --> 00:49:29,451
Sir, the stress breeder is inside
being demobilized as we speak.

689
00:49:31,452 --> 00:49:34,444
Shit. Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off.

690
00:49:35,012 --> 00:49:37,321
I'll get you with the next shot.

691
00:49:39,052 --> 00:49:40,565
I don't think so.

692
00:49:42,652 --> 00:49:44,722
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

693
00:49:46,132 --> 00:49:48,043
You were doing so well.

694
00:49:49,012 --> 00:49:51,082
Don't you have a job to do?

695
00:49:51,972 --> 00:49:55,442
Isn't there a thought repeating
in your barbaric brain?

696
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:57,764
The name Friendly.

697
00:49:57,932 --> 00:49:59,650
Mr. Edgar Friendly.

698
00:50:00,132 --> 00:50:02,407
Don't you have someone to kill?

699
00:50:09,812 --> 00:50:11,723
-Yeah, I do.
-Excellent.

700
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:15,203
Then go and do your job.

701
00:50:17,732 --> 00:50:18,608
Shit.

702
00:50:18,812 --> 00:50:20,484
Saved by the bell.

703
00:50:26,372 --> 00:50:27,487
Shit!

704
00:50:36,332 --> 00:50:37,447
Damn!

705
00:50:39,732 --> 00:50:41,802
You're lucky he didn't whack you.

706
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:46,250
I must say that "whacking," whatever it is,
sounds most disagreeable.

707
00:50:47,092 --> 00:50:48,844
You scared him away.

708
00:50:48,972 --> 00:50:51,611
I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.

709
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:53,045
No problem.

710
00:50:55,412 --> 00:50:57,448
Not bad for a 74-year-old.

711
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:01,005
Simon Phoenix knows
he has some competition.

712
00:51:01,212 --> 00:51:03,282
He's finally matched his meat.

713
00:51:03,412 --> 00:51:05,448
You really licked his ass.

714
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:08,244
That's "met his match"...

715
00:51:08,372 --> 00:51:10,328
...and "kicked his ass."

716
00:51:10,932 --> 00:51:13,400
"Met his match and kicked his ass."

717
00:51:14,332 --> 00:51:15,685
Captain Earle....

718
00:51:16,212 --> 00:51:17,804
Who is this man?

719
00:51:18,332 --> 00:51:22,484
John Spartan, temporarily reinstated
to the San Angeles Police Department...

720
00:51:22,652 --> 00:51:25,371
...to pursue the escaped cryo-con
Simon Phoenix.

721
00:51:26,652 --> 00:51:29,803
You told us to do everything
in our power to capture him.

722
00:51:30,012 --> 00:51:31,650
Yes, I did. I did.

723
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:34,884
Yes, I do recall the exploits
of Mr. John Spartan.

724
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,406
Yes, of course. The Demolition Man.

725
00:51:39,332 --> 00:51:41,004
That's quite all right.

726
00:51:41,092 --> 00:51:42,764
Unexpected. Creative.

727
00:51:43,972 --> 00:51:45,371
But quite all right.

728
00:51:45,452 --> 00:51:47,283
John Spartan, welcome.

729
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:50,362
In honor of your arrival and your...

730
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:52,761
...protection of the sanctity of human life...

731
00:51:52,852 --> 00:51:54,490
...namely my own...

732
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,206
...l'd like to invite you to join me
for dinner tonight.

733
00:51:57,292 --> 00:51:58,407
Both of you.

734
00:51:58,492 --> 00:51:59,891
Please, I insist.

735
00:52:00,132 --> 00:52:02,202
I would like you to accompany me...

736
00:52:02,332 --> 00:52:03,924
...to Pizza Hut.

737
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:09,123
Look forward to it. Thanks.

738
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:16,411
"Pizza Hut?"

739
00:52:19,732 --> 00:52:21,529
So let me get this right:

740
00:52:21,652 --> 00:52:25,406
Spacely Sprockets here, who's now
the man in charge, the Mayor-Gov...

741
00:52:25,492 --> 00:52:27,801
...who wants to take me to Pizza Hut...

742
00:52:27,892 --> 00:52:29,530
...and I wouldn't mind a pizza...

743
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:31,409
...has also built the damn cryo-prison?

744
00:52:31,492 --> 00:52:33,767
John Spartan, you are fined....

745
00:52:34,052 --> 00:52:36,850
Dr. Cocteau is the most important man
in town.

746
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:39,606
He practically created our whole way
of life...

747
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:41,011
...savage.

748
00:52:41,612 --> 00:52:42,840
He can have it.

749
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:45,291
Phoenix could be anywhere...

750
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:47,010
...but not being coded can limit him.

751
00:52:47,092 --> 00:52:49,083
Correct. Money is outmoded.

752
00:52:49,172 --> 00:52:51,128
All transactions are through codes.

753
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:53,851
So he can't buy food
or a place to stay for the night.

754
00:52:53,932 --> 00:52:56,492
It'd be a waste of time to mug someone.

755
00:52:57,212 --> 00:52:59,487
Unless he rips off someone's hand.

756
00:52:59,572 --> 00:53:01,528
But with officers patrolling...

757
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:04,809
...it should be just a matter
of tick-tocks before--

758
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:07,769
We already have a backup plan.

759
00:53:08,892 --> 00:53:11,201
We can wait for another code to go red.

760
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:14,405
When Phoenix performs
another MurderDeathKill...

761
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:17,211
...we'll know exactly where to pounce.

762
00:53:17,692 --> 00:53:18,522
Great plan.

763
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,931
Thank you.

764
00:53:25,612 --> 00:53:28,763
I've been an enthusiast of your escapades
for quite some time.

765
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:32,811
In fact, I perused some visuals
from the Schwarzenegger Library.

766
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:34,327
Hold it.

767
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,850
"The Schwarzenegger Library?"

768
00:53:36,932 --> 00:53:39,605
Yes, the Schwarzenegger
Presidential Library.

769
00:53:39,852 --> 00:53:41,285
Wasn't he an actor?

770
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:43,090
He was President?

771
00:53:43,612 --> 00:53:47,764
Even though he wasn't a native,
his popularity caused the 61st Amendment.

772
00:53:48,052 --> 00:53:49,849
I don't want to know.

773
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:53,171
President?

774
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,487
What's this? No welcome mat?

775
00:54:06,732 --> 00:54:08,165
What is this?

776
00:54:11,212 --> 00:54:13,680
How do they expect you to kill somebody?

777
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:19,208
Shit, I love that smell.
Reminds me of biscuits and gravy.

778
00:54:19,532 --> 00:54:21,602
All right. A job is a job.

779
00:54:23,252 --> 00:54:27,370
Edgar Friendly, whoever the fuck you are,
prepare for Simon Phoenix.

780
00:54:30,452 --> 00:54:32,010
What's with Cocteau?

781
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:35,325
He says I saved his life,
though I'm not sure of it.

782
00:54:35,412 --> 00:54:38,245
My reward is dinner and dancing
at Pizza Hut?

783
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:41,245
I like a big, fat piece of pizza, but....

784
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:43,443
Your tone is quasi-facetious.

785
00:54:43,932 --> 00:54:47,322
Pizza Hut is the only restaurant
to survive the Franchise Wars.

786
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:48,487
So?

787
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:51,482
Now all restaurants are Pizza Hut.

788
00:54:52,972 --> 00:54:54,166
No way.

789
00:55:03,412 --> 00:55:05,209
Welcome to Pizza Hut.

790
00:55:05,812 --> 00:55:07,370
Enjoy your meal.

791
00:55:09,012 --> 00:55:11,321
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant

792
00:55:13,892 --> 00:55:16,042
"Good things from the garden

793
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:18,089
"Garden in the valley

794
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:21,081
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"

795
00:55:24,172 --> 00:55:26,242
Here comes the Neanderthal.

796
00:55:26,812 --> 00:55:29,565
Mr. Spartan over there please,
and Lieutenant....

797
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:30,761
Thank you.

798
00:55:33,772 --> 00:55:35,364
How are you doing?

799
00:55:37,732 --> 00:55:39,723
Enjoy-joy your meal, sir.

800
00:55:40,532 --> 00:55:41,647
Good thing I'm hungry.

801
00:55:41,732 --> 00:55:46,010
Ladies and gentlemen, please raise
your glasses to the hero of the hour...

802
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:48,085
...my savior...

803
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:50,248
...Detective John Spartan.

804
00:55:52,452 --> 00:55:53,771
Appreciate it.

805
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,484
Greetings and salutations.

806
00:55:58,732 --> 00:56:00,245
I'm Associate Bob.

807
00:56:00,332 --> 00:56:03,847
We met before, ever so briefly.
I was in fear at the time.

808
00:56:04,972 --> 00:56:06,769
Do you have the salt?

809
00:56:07,772 --> 00:56:10,650
Salt is not good for you, hence, it is illegal.

810
00:56:10,892 --> 00:56:12,723
So, John Spartan, tell me...

811
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:16,330
...what do you think of San Angeles, 2032?

812
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:21,129
I thought the future would be
a rotting cesspool.

813
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:25,129
You weren't here
when the real disturbances began.

814
00:56:25,212 --> 00:56:27,772
Civilization tried to destroy itself.

815
00:56:28,172 --> 00:56:31,050
The city degenerated into a total fear zone.

816
00:56:31,532 --> 00:56:35,764
People stayed home, afraid to go out.
People wanted the madness over.

817
00:56:36,932 --> 00:56:39,651
When I saw the chance
to make things right...

818
00:56:39,812 --> 00:56:41,211
...l seized it.

819
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:46,486
If I had not, the radiance
of San Angeles would not be here.

820
00:56:46,892 --> 00:56:51,408
Just your rotting cesspool of hate
and suffering. Which would you prefer?

821
00:56:51,692 --> 00:56:55,207
Can you book me a flight out of here
when the sermon's over?

822
00:56:55,372 --> 00:56:56,646
John Spartan...

823
00:56:56,812 --> 00:56:59,929
...for your crimes you would
surely have died...

824
00:57:00,012 --> 00:57:01,365
...in jail before now.

825
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:05,286
Even you must appreciate
the persuasively tranquil humanity...

826
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:07,967
...of the cryo-prison system?

827
00:57:08,812 --> 00:57:13,408
I don't want to spoil your dinner, but
my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby.

828
00:57:13,572 --> 00:57:15,528
I had feelings and thoughts.

829
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:19,327
How about a 36-year nightmare
about people caught in a burning building?

830
00:57:19,412 --> 00:57:21,368
You were awake? I don't think so.

831
00:57:21,452 --> 00:57:22,805
I think so.

832
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:27,046
My wife beating her fists against a block
of ice that was her husband.

833
00:57:27,132 --> 00:57:31,523
Then you woke me up and told me
everything that meant something is gone.

834
00:57:32,012 --> 00:57:35,971
It would have been more humane
to leave me to the fucking crows.

835
00:57:37,092 --> 00:57:40,084
What would you say
if I called you a brutish fossil...

836
00:57:40,172 --> 00:57:43,482
...symbolic of the decayed era
gratefully forgotten?

837
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:46,524
I don't know. "Thanks?"

838
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:49,282
I thought during rehabilitation...

839
00:57:49,452 --> 00:57:53,286
...the prisoners were not conscious.
A person would go insane.

840
00:57:53,412 --> 00:57:55,323
The side-effects of the cryo-process...

841
00:57:55,412 --> 00:57:56,731
...are unavoidable.

842
00:57:56,812 --> 00:57:58,723
You were found guilty of a crime.

843
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:00,803
You owed and still owe a debt to society.

844
00:58:00,892 --> 00:58:02,086
There's nothing I can do.

845
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:04,845
Yes, call for backup.
I'll be across the street.

846
00:58:04,932 --> 00:58:06,331
Where are you going?

847
00:58:06,412 --> 00:58:10,166
Bad guys about to do bad things.
It's just one of those hunches.

848
00:58:29,892 --> 00:58:31,007
Go for the truck!

849
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:32,730
The food's in the truck!

850
00:58:35,412 --> 00:58:37,368
Grab the big box! Move!

851
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:52,088
You'll regret this the rest of your life.
Both seconds of it.

852
00:58:57,132 --> 00:58:58,247
Good night!

853
00:59:07,652 --> 00:59:08,880
Get him!

854
00:59:25,932 --> 00:59:28,162
What a fucking hero. Come on.

855
00:59:37,332 --> 00:59:38,651
Please, don't.

856
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,600
What the hell?

857
00:59:46,572 --> 00:59:48,164
Such reckless abandonment.

858
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:50,561
Looks like there is a new shepherd in town.

859
00:59:50,652 --> 00:59:52,847
That's "sheriff." Who are those guys?

860
00:59:52,932 --> 00:59:54,888
They're known as "scraps."

861
00:59:55,212 --> 00:59:57,772
Outcasts and deserters who choose
to live beneath us...

862
00:59:57,852 --> 01:00:00,320
...in sewers and abandoned tunnels.

863
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:04,250
They're a constant irritation
to our harmony.

864
01:00:04,652 --> 01:00:06,370
They're nothing but thugs.

865
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:10,725
A society of thieves. The last remaining
criminal element in the city.

866
01:00:10,972 --> 01:00:14,203
But plans are in progress
to purge this peril from our day.

867
01:00:14,532 --> 01:00:16,887
You're better live than on laser disk.

868
01:00:16,972 --> 01:00:20,408
The way you paused to make a witticism
before doing battle...

869
01:00:20,572 --> 01:00:22,244
...with that Scrap--

870
01:00:22,412 --> 01:00:24,323
This isn't the Wild West, okay?

871
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,767
The Wild West wasn't even the Wild West.

872
01:00:26,852 --> 01:00:28,604
Hurting people isn't good.

873
01:00:28,892 --> 01:00:30,484
Sometimes it is, but not...

874
01:00:30,572 --> 01:00:32,802
...when it's people looking for food.

875
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:43,162
San Angeles time is now 22:15.

876
01:00:44,412 --> 01:00:45,606
Coding off.

877
01:00:45,772 --> 01:00:46,841
Auto-drive.

878
01:00:46,932 --> 01:00:48,650
Auto-drive engaged.

879
01:00:53,932 --> 01:00:55,968
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

880
01:00:57,692 --> 01:00:59,922
No need for a de-hurtful retraction.

881
01:01:00,212 --> 01:01:02,646
I assimilated too much contraband.

882
01:01:02,932 --> 01:01:06,891
I fleshed you out as
a blow-up-the-bad- guy-while-grinning type.

883
01:01:07,132 --> 01:01:11,410
But you're the moody-gunslinger-who-
will-only-draw-when-he-must type.

884
01:01:12,492 --> 01:01:13,288
Stop.

885
01:01:13,372 --> 01:01:14,168
What?

886
01:01:14,252 --> 01:01:16,402
I just do my job and things get--

887
01:01:16,492 --> 01:01:17,607
Demolished.

888
01:01:24,892 --> 01:01:28,362
I think of my daughter growing up
in a place like this.

889
01:01:28,612 --> 01:01:31,285
I'm afraid she'll think I'm a primitive.

890
01:01:31,452 --> 01:01:34,364
As much as I want to see her,
I almost don't want to.

891
01:01:34,452 --> 01:01:36,966
Because I don't think I'll fit in well.

892
01:01:37,132 --> 01:01:38,485
Not at all.

893
01:01:40,772 --> 01:01:44,685
It'd be a minor misuse of police powers,
but I could do a search for you.

894
01:01:50,252 --> 01:01:51,401
Sorry.

895
01:01:55,332 --> 01:01:57,641
Subject change. I got what you wanted.

896
01:01:57,772 --> 01:01:58,887
Great.

897
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:04,291
What's that for?

898
01:02:05,332 --> 01:02:07,448
It's just one of those cop hunches.

899
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:17,726
Lights.

900
01:02:19,212 --> 01:02:20,884
I've changed that.

901
01:02:21,692 --> 01:02:23,045
Illuminate.

902
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:25,845
Deluminate.

903
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,445
Isn't that nicer?

904
01:02:30,572 --> 01:02:32,164
Go ahead, you try.

905
01:02:33,532 --> 01:02:34,885
Illuminate.

906
01:02:37,372 --> 01:02:39,886
Raymond, Raymond, we've got to talk.

907
01:02:40,652 --> 01:02:42,210
How did you get in?

908
01:02:42,332 --> 01:02:44,607
Wish I knew. I got pass codes.

909
01:02:45,452 --> 01:02:46,965
Routes to underground kingdoms.

910
01:02:47,052 --> 01:02:50,488
Complete access
to the industrial data-grid interface.

911
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,962
I don't even know what that means.

912
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:56,010
But I've been meaning to ask you,
because I like it!

913
01:02:56,092 --> 01:02:57,525
I like it a lot!

914
01:02:59,372 --> 01:03:01,681
You have been given these skills
for a reason.

915
01:03:01,772 --> 01:03:04,081
Not for your personal amusement.

916
01:03:04,372 --> 01:03:08,160
Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly
and stop a revolution.

917
01:03:09,092 --> 01:03:11,560
That is why you were rehabilitated.

918
01:03:14,492 --> 01:03:17,928
All right. I'm going to do
your dastardly deed for you.

919
01:03:18,812 --> 01:03:21,645
But it'll be more difficult than you thought.

920
01:03:21,772 --> 01:03:23,922
I'm going to need some help.

921
01:03:24,332 --> 01:03:27,369
I'll need about five
or six more "special" men.

922
01:03:28,652 --> 01:03:30,244
I happen to have a list.

923
01:03:30,412 --> 01:03:34,963
I wouldn't want you to defrost any
of those killer types, know what I mean?

924
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:38,727
And none of those motherfuckers
from New York. They're too uptight.

925
01:03:38,812 --> 01:03:41,645
So you're going to be the only killer type?

926
01:03:45,932 --> 01:03:46,967
Fine.

927
01:03:47,932 --> 01:03:49,251
Take care of it.

928
01:03:50,572 --> 01:03:52,085
Just get it over with.

929
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,687
You're more trouble than you're worth.

930
01:03:54,892 --> 01:03:57,042
Oh, Raymond, don't say that.

931
01:03:58,812 --> 01:04:01,246
And what do I get out of all this?

932
01:04:03,612 --> 01:04:05,125
What do you want?

933
01:04:05,692 --> 01:04:06,647
Malibu.

934
01:04:07,532 --> 01:04:10,888
Santa Monica.
Hell, how about all the coastal cities?

935
01:04:12,412 --> 01:04:14,164
I'll bear it in mind.

936
01:04:14,332 --> 01:04:17,210
-Good, I'll send you a memo.
-Just do your job!

937
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:24,001
What is John Spartan doing here?

938
01:04:25,692 --> 01:04:27,762
Did you invite him to this party?

939
01:04:29,612 --> 01:04:31,603
Look, you finish your business...

940
01:04:31,692 --> 01:04:33,762
...and I'll stuff him back in the freezer.

941
01:04:33,852 --> 01:04:36,002
Think of him as a guarantee.

942
01:04:36,252 --> 01:04:37,651
"A guarantee?"

943
01:04:38,412 --> 01:04:40,642
You don't have much of a guarantee.

944
01:04:41,212 --> 01:04:44,363
I took care of Spartan once,
I'll take care of him again.

945
01:04:47,532 --> 01:04:49,841
Now we need those men defrosted.

946
01:04:54,332 --> 01:04:55,924
Is this where you live?

947
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,445
Very not bad.

948
01:04:57,612 --> 01:04:58,681
Thank you.

949
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:01,203
Where will I be staying?

950
01:05:01,372 --> 01:05:04,603
I've procured you a domicile
down the corridor from my own.

951
01:05:07,892 --> 01:05:10,725
Everything is voice coded,
so if you need something, just ask.

952
01:05:10,812 --> 01:05:11,927
Lights.

953
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:14,851
What do you think?

954
01:05:15,812 --> 01:05:19,361
Clicked off a lot of credits to create
the perfect 20th-century apartment.

955
01:05:19,452 --> 01:05:20,726
It's very....

956
01:05:20,892 --> 01:05:21,927
Isn't it?

957
01:05:24,652 --> 01:05:26,005
John Spartan....

958
01:05:28,332 --> 01:05:30,721
There's a well-known, documented...

959
01:05:30,892 --> 01:05:33,360
...connection between sex and violence.

960
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:36,083
Not so much a causal effect...

961
01:05:36,252 --> 01:05:39,210
...but a general state
of neurological arousal.

962
01:05:39,692 --> 01:05:40,841
And...

963
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:44,761
...after having observed
your behavior this evening and...

964
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:47,762
...my resultant condition...

965
01:05:50,732 --> 01:05:53,610
...l was wondering
if you'd like to have sex?

966
01:05:58,732 --> 01:05:59,767
With you?

967
01:06:02,332 --> 01:06:03,208
Here?

968
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:05,287
Now?

969
01:06:07,932 --> 01:06:08,808
Yeah.

970
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:10,522
Great!

971
01:06:13,132 --> 01:06:14,565
I'll be right back.

972
01:06:31,372 --> 01:06:32,691
Love Boat?

973
01:06:51,492 --> 01:06:52,686
There you go.

974
01:06:58,052 --> 01:07:01,044
Now, just relax.
We'll begin in a few seconds.

975
01:07:02,212 --> 01:07:03,486
Begin what?

976
01:07:04,132 --> 01:07:05,963
Having sex, of course.

977
01:08:02,372 --> 01:08:03,771
You broke contact.

978
01:08:03,932 --> 01:08:06,287
"Contact?" I didn't even touch you yet.

979
01:08:06,372 --> 01:08:08,442
You said you wanted to make love.

980
01:08:08,772 --> 01:08:10,285
Is that what this is?

981
01:08:12,572 --> 01:08:17,009
Vir-sex produces high alpha waves
during transference of sexual energies.

982
01:08:17,212 --> 01:08:19,646
Let's do it the old-fashioned way.

983
01:08:20,612 --> 01:08:21,886
Disgusting!

984
01:08:22,052 --> 01:08:23,167
You mean...

985
01:08:24,572 --> 01:08:28,042
-...fluid transfer?
-No, I mean boning, the wild mambo.

986
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:31,010
That is no longer done.

987
01:08:31,332 --> 01:08:34,404
Do you know what the exchange
of bodily fluids leads to?

988
01:08:34,532 --> 01:08:36,807
Kids, smoking, desire to raid the fridge.

989
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:41,408
Rampant exchange of bodily fluids
was a major cause of society's downfall.

990
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:44,844
After AIDS, there was NRS,
then there was UBT.

991
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:48,404
One of the first things Cocteau did
was to outlaw...

992
01:08:48,572 --> 01:08:52,406
...and engineer all fluid transfer
out of socially acceptable behavior.

993
01:08:52,612 --> 01:08:55,172
Not even a mouth transfer's condoned.

994
01:08:55,332 --> 01:08:56,685
Kissing's not allowed?

995
01:08:56,772 --> 01:08:58,205
I was a good kisser.

996
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:01,206
What about kids?

997
01:09:01,732 --> 01:09:03,131
Procreation?

998
01:09:03,452 --> 01:09:04,885
We go to a lab.

999
01:09:05,092 --> 01:09:07,083
Fluids are purified, screened...

1000
01:09:07,172 --> 01:09:10,323
...and transferred by authorized
medical personnel only.

1001
01:09:10,492 --> 01:09:12,289
It is the only legal way.

1002
01:09:15,612 --> 01:09:17,011
What're you doing?

1003
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:19,045
Breaking the law.

1004
01:09:20,772 --> 01:09:22,808
You are a savage creature.

1005
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,726
I wish you to leave my domicile. Now!

1006
01:09:31,972 --> 01:09:33,246
You know....

1007
01:09:52,892 --> 01:09:55,406
Code accepted. Be well, John Spartan.

1008
01:10:05,212 --> 01:10:06,406
Lights.

1009
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:26,205
"He doesn't know how
to use the three seashells."

1010
01:10:32,772 --> 01:10:34,364
Happy Halloween.

1011
01:11:04,572 --> 01:11:06,563
"Behavioral engineering?"

1012
01:11:07,652 --> 01:11:11,281
Hi, Martin, I was thinking....
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, wrong number.

1013
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:26,564
Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans.

1014
01:11:27,452 --> 01:11:29,727
Someone will pay dearly for this.

1015
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:36,562
Sir, the stress breeder
is inside being demobilized.

1016
01:11:38,012 --> 01:11:41,004
Shit! Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off. Don't worry.

1017
01:11:41,092 --> 01:11:42,525
The next shot.

1018
01:11:42,692 --> 01:11:44,250
I don't think so.

1019
01:11:44,892 --> 01:11:46,962
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

1020
01:11:59,492 --> 01:12:01,562
I'm sorry about last night.

1021
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:04,885
I made this for you.

1022
01:12:08,612 --> 01:12:09,522
For me?

1023
01:12:12,132 --> 01:12:13,406
Thank you.

1024
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:17,727
I'll drive.

1025
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:20,447
I must learn to do this sometime.

1026
01:12:33,732 --> 01:12:35,484
Thanks for the lovely gift.

1027
01:12:36,412 --> 01:12:40,928
I don't know what was in my cryo-sludge
but when I thawed, I wanted to knit.

1028
01:12:41,412 --> 01:12:45,200
How come I know what a zipperfoot,
a shuttle and a bobbin is?

1029
01:12:46,212 --> 01:12:49,010
I could weave a throw rug now
with my eyes closed.

1030
01:12:49,372 --> 01:12:51,363
It's part of your rehab program.

1031
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:54,125
For each inmate the computer
draws up a skill or trade...

1032
01:12:54,212 --> 01:12:56,043
...suited to their genetic disposition.

1033
01:12:56,132 --> 01:12:57,770
It implants the knowledge...

1034
01:12:57,852 --> 01:13:00,810
...and the desire to carry out
the training assigned.

1035
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:03,805
I'm a seamstress?

1036
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:05,526
That's great.

1037
01:13:05,692 --> 01:13:08,206
I come out of cryo-prison
and I'm Betsy-fucking-Ross.

1038
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:10,647
Phoenix can access computers,
operate all vehicles...

1039
01:13:10,732 --> 01:13:13,007
...knows the location
of everything in town...

1040
01:13:13,092 --> 01:13:15,606
...and is three times stronger than before?

1041
01:13:18,052 --> 01:13:20,441
Can you get me his rehab program?

1042
01:13:22,972 --> 01:13:25,770
-I'm a seamstress.
-Access code for Simon Phoenix.

1043
01:13:26,172 --> 01:13:27,764
Access Simon Phoenix.

1044
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:29,520
Accessing.

1045
01:13:30,812 --> 01:13:32,006
Access denied.

1046
01:13:32,892 --> 01:13:34,405
-What?
-Security override.

1047
01:13:34,492 --> 01:13:35,971
That can't be right.

1048
01:13:39,652 --> 01:13:41,927
Access granted, Officer Huxley.

1049
01:13:42,932 --> 01:13:45,890
Accessing Simon Phoenix,
Deepfile rehab 65-R.

1050
01:13:46,692 --> 01:13:47,841
Urban Combatkill.

1051
01:13:47,932 --> 01:13:50,207
Torture Methodology.
Computer Override Authority.

1052
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:52,169
-There must be a mistake.
-Survival Tactics.

1053
01:13:52,252 --> 01:13:55,483
Terrorism Tactics. Weapons Training.
Martial Arts. MurderDeathKill.

1054
01:13:55,572 --> 01:13:57,642
Explosives Technician. Violent Behavior.

1055
01:13:57,732 --> 01:14:00,485
-This isn't a rehab program.
-No kidding.

1056
01:14:00,772 --> 01:14:02,569
This would create a monster.

1057
01:14:02,652 --> 01:14:04,210
Who develops these programs?

1058
01:14:04,292 --> 01:14:05,884
Cocteau lndustries.

1059
01:14:06,652 --> 01:14:08,324
But why would the benevolent...

1060
01:14:08,412 --> 01:14:11,370
...Dr. Cocteau send such
a brute savage into our midst?

1061
01:14:11,452 --> 01:14:13,283
Good question. Let's go ask him.

1062
01:14:13,372 --> 01:14:16,921
You do not accuse our savior
of being connected with a...

1063
01:14:17,092 --> 01:14:19,652
...multi-murderer like Phoenix. It's...

1064
01:14:20,452 --> 01:14:21,680
...rude.

1065
01:14:22,012 --> 01:14:23,331
I'll be subtle.

1066
01:14:24,612 --> 01:14:26,045
I'm good at subtle.

1067
01:14:28,132 --> 01:14:29,565
Mellow greetings.

1068
01:14:29,732 --> 01:14:31,165
We welcome you...

1069
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:34,125
...to the Cocteau Behavioral
Engineering Complex.

1070
01:14:34,212 --> 01:14:35,281
Be well.

1071
01:14:35,452 --> 01:14:37,408
Enhance your calm, John Spartan.

1072
01:14:42,492 --> 01:14:45,962
Mellow apologies for my lack
ofphysical disposition...

1073
01:14:46,332 --> 01:14:48,163
...but I have a city-gov to run.

1074
01:14:48,252 --> 01:14:49,765
Well, run this.

1075
01:14:50,012 --> 01:14:53,288
You programmed Phoenix's rehab
to turn him into a terrorist.

1076
01:14:53,372 --> 01:14:55,840
And I don't think his escape
was an accident.

1077
01:14:55,932 --> 01:14:57,081
Very subtle.

1078
01:14:57,652 --> 01:14:59,768
Outside the museum,
why didn't he kill you?

1079
01:14:59,852 --> 01:15:01,171
What did you say?

1080
01:15:01,252 --> 01:15:03,482
I don't remember. Does it matter?

1081
01:15:03,652 --> 01:15:05,802
It matters. I saw the security disk.

1082
01:15:05,892 --> 01:15:09,521
He had 10 seconds to figure out
where to put the hole in your head.

1083
01:15:09,732 --> 01:15:13,964
This display of barbaric behavior
was unacceptable even in your time.

1084
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:17,771
But it worked.

1085
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:27,083
When Phoenix has a gun, 10 seconds
is 9 1/2 seconds longer than you get.

1086
01:15:27,972 --> 01:15:29,451
Not everyone is as eager as you...

1087
01:15:29,532 --> 01:15:32,888
...to resort to violence
to solve life's difficulties.

1088
01:15:34,372 --> 01:15:39,048
I wonder if the chaos in the museum
was the result of Mr. Phoenix's presence.

1089
01:15:39,932 --> 01:15:41,331
Wonder about this...

1090
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:42,561
...shithead.

1091
01:15:42,652 --> 01:15:46,042
If you think you got this maniac
under control, trust me...

1092
01:15:46,212 --> 01:15:47,486
...you don't.

1093
01:15:47,772 --> 01:15:51,606
Is there something specific you plan
to do with that archaic device?

1094
01:15:54,972 --> 01:15:56,564
No, I didn't think so.

1095
01:15:58,532 --> 01:16:01,524
The only thing I haven't got
under control is you.

1096
01:16:01,692 --> 01:16:03,603
But that can be solved.

1097
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:07,162
You, my Cro-Magnon friend, are dead.
Your family's dead...

1098
01:16:07,332 --> 01:16:08,845
...your past is dead.

1099
01:16:09,252 --> 01:16:11,925
Dead things cannot affect the living. So...

1100
01:16:12,252 --> 01:16:13,810
...enjoy your moment...

1101
01:16:13,892 --> 01:16:17,680
...of prehistoric bravado because
after you leave here it will be over.

1102
01:16:17,772 --> 01:16:20,081
Like everything else in your life.

1103
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:23,602
Officer, return this man
to cryo-stasis immediately.

1104
01:16:24,132 --> 01:16:25,360
Be well.

1105
01:16:26,692 --> 01:16:28,011
Be fucked.

1106
01:16:28,772 --> 01:16:30,649
You are fined one credit--

1107
01:16:35,612 --> 01:16:38,649
Greetings, Citizen.
How are you on this glorious day?

1108
01:16:39,572 --> 01:16:40,846
I'll wait here.

1109
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:41,882
Let's go.

1110
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:44,486
-I don't know.
-I do know. Turn that thing on.

1111
01:16:44,572 --> 01:16:46,642
I hope you know what you're doing.

1112
01:16:47,612 --> 01:16:50,001
You're asking me to disobey a direct order.

1113
01:16:50,092 --> 01:16:52,003
I'm to escort you to the cryo-prison.

1114
01:16:52,092 --> 01:16:55,926
I must get that maniac and put him
on ice or that's where I'll be.

1115
01:16:56,132 --> 01:16:58,805
-Enhance your calm.
-I've had it with enhancing my calm.

1116
01:16:58,892 --> 01:17:03,283
I'll enhance that psycho's calm.
Then I'll turn my attention to Cocteau.

1117
01:17:04,772 --> 01:17:07,445
You don't have to come with me.
I can do it alone.

1118
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:11,207
Even if Phoenix was programmed
to escape, kill and steal...

1119
01:17:11,812 --> 01:17:13,643
...why are you going to the wasteland?

1120
01:17:13,732 --> 01:17:17,725
Your city-wide manhunt didn't work
because Phoenix was in a place...

1121
01:17:17,892 --> 01:17:19,405
...you can't monitor...

1122
01:17:19,492 --> 01:17:22,370
...afraid to go and don't give a shit about.

1123
01:17:23,012 --> 01:17:26,971
I want to go down there, find Phoenix
and put him in a hurt locker.

1124
01:17:28,292 --> 01:17:30,681
Do you want to come? Or arrest me?

1125
01:17:33,252 --> 01:17:34,526
I'm with you.

1126
01:17:35,132 --> 01:17:36,770
Let's go blow this guy.

1127
01:17:39,132 --> 01:17:40,087
Away.

1128
01:17:40,252 --> 01:17:41,970
Blow this guy away.

1129
01:17:43,012 --> 01:17:44,081
Whatever.

1130
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,004
She has a way with words.

1131
01:17:58,212 --> 01:17:59,247
What's wrong?

1132
01:17:59,332 --> 01:18:01,050
It's not very clean.

1133
01:18:05,532 --> 01:18:07,170
A real garden spot.

1134
01:18:07,772 --> 01:18:09,251
Okay, which way?

1135
01:18:09,532 --> 01:18:10,647
Over there.

1136
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,888
Okay, be ready for anything.

1137
01:18:20,732 --> 01:18:22,962
"My dog's better than your dog

1138
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:25,202
"My dog's better than yours

1139
01:18:25,412 --> 01:18:28,404
"My dog's better 'cause
he gets Kennel-Ration"

1140
01:18:29,092 --> 01:18:31,447
I'm sorry, when I'm nervous, l....

1141
01:18:31,932 --> 01:18:32,887
Sorry.

1142
01:18:33,572 --> 01:18:34,891
Over here.

1143
01:18:54,972 --> 01:18:56,803
What's that emanation?

1144
01:19:01,412 --> 01:19:02,640
Come on.

1145
01:19:11,132 --> 01:19:13,521
Relax. I just want a burger and a beer.

1146
01:19:15,652 --> 01:19:16,926
How will I pay?

1147
01:19:18,652 --> 01:19:20,244
It's better to give.

1148
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:29,087
Want a slug?

1149
01:19:32,092 --> 01:19:33,366
No, thank you.

1150
01:19:33,572 --> 01:19:35,324
I think I'll be sick.

1151
01:19:35,612 --> 01:19:36,840
Oh, God.

1152
01:19:37,252 --> 01:19:39,686
This is fantastic. You must try one.

1153
01:19:39,972 --> 01:19:42,361
Don't ask where the meat comes from.

1154
01:19:42,532 --> 01:19:43,885
What do you mean?

1155
01:19:43,972 --> 01:19:45,963
See any cows around here?

1156
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:55,287
Rat?

1157
01:19:56,932 --> 01:19:58,445
This is a rat burger?

1158
01:20:03,292 --> 01:20:04,441
Not bad.

1159
01:20:05,852 --> 01:20:08,161
It's the best burger I've had in years.

1160
01:20:10,812 --> 01:20:12,086
See you later.

1161
01:20:34,332 --> 01:20:37,051
They don't seem very hostile,
John Spartan.

1162
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:39,446
No, they don't.

1163
01:20:48,452 --> 01:20:50,647
Now that's a thing of beauty.

1164
01:20:52,572 --> 01:20:54,130
Do you know what this is?

1165
01:20:54,212 --> 01:20:56,043
A 1970 Oldsmobile 442.

1166
01:20:58,972 --> 01:21:01,167
With a 455-cubic-inch engine.

1167
01:21:02,492 --> 01:21:04,722
Radial tires and bucket seats.

1168
01:21:06,052 --> 01:21:07,326
I'm impressed.

1169
01:21:07,572 --> 01:21:08,641
I studied.

1170
01:21:08,732 --> 01:21:11,121
So did l. Hand over the glow-rod.

1171
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:13,362
Your friends too. Come on.

1172
01:21:21,252 --> 01:21:23,561
You got balls, coming down here.

1173
01:21:24,252 --> 01:21:26,288
We're looking for a MurderDeathKiller.

1174
01:21:26,372 --> 01:21:29,728
Can you help us or just bully us
with your primitive weapons?

1175
01:21:34,372 --> 01:21:36,328
Maybe they're not so primitive.

1176
01:21:38,972 --> 01:21:40,530
You think you're taking me in?

1177
01:21:40,612 --> 01:21:41,647
Guess what?

1178
01:21:41,732 --> 01:21:42,926
Not happening.

1179
01:21:43,132 --> 01:21:46,044
Tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass.
That's right.

1180
01:21:46,372 --> 01:21:48,647
It'll take an army to get rid of me.

1181
01:21:48,732 --> 01:21:50,927
I don't give a shit. I got nothing to lose.

1182
01:21:51,012 --> 01:21:55,324
I don't know who the hell you are,
let alone want to take you anywhere.

1183
01:21:55,812 --> 01:21:58,849
So stay here, be well
and Cocteau's an asshole!

1184
01:21:59,932 --> 01:22:03,129
Let's dump them up top.
They're only here to spy on us.

1185
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:05,446
Wait a minute.

1186
01:22:07,132 --> 01:22:09,248
You're the guy outside Pizza Hut.

1187
01:22:10,932 --> 01:22:12,285
What do you want?

1188
01:22:12,772 --> 01:22:15,127
You weren't part of the Cocteau plan.

1189
01:22:15,292 --> 01:22:18,443
Greed, deception, abuse of power.
That's no plan.

1190
01:22:20,892 --> 01:22:23,167
-That's why you're here?
-That's right.

1191
01:22:23,332 --> 01:22:24,287
See....

1192
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:26,643
According to Cocteau's plan...

1193
01:22:26,812 --> 01:22:29,201
...l'm an enemy because I like to think.

1194
01:22:29,532 --> 01:22:30,601
I like to read.

1195
01:22:30,692 --> 01:22:32,489
I'm into freedom of speech and choice.

1196
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:34,130
I like to sit in a greasy spoon...

1197
01:22:34,212 --> 01:22:38,330
...and think, "Should I have steak
or barbecued ribs with gravy fries?"

1198
01:22:38,532 --> 01:22:39,851
I want high cholesterol.

1199
01:22:39,932 --> 01:22:42,321
I want to eat bacon, butter and cheese.

1200
01:22:42,492 --> 01:22:45,131
I want to smoke a Cuban cigar
the size of Cincinnati.

1201
01:22:45,212 --> 01:22:48,010
I want to run through the streets naked...

1202
01:22:48,252 --> 01:22:51,324
...reading Playboy magazine
because I might need to.

1203
01:22:51,492 --> 01:22:52,971
I've seen the future.

1204
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:54,804
It's a 47-year-old virgin...

1205
01:22:54,892 --> 01:22:57,804
...drinking a banana-broccoli shake
and singing "I'm a wiener."

1206
01:22:57,892 --> 01:22:59,371
Up top, you live Cocteau's way.

1207
01:22:59,452 --> 01:23:01,522
What he wants, when he wants,
how he wants.

1208
01:23:01,612 --> 01:23:03,762
Your other choice: come here.

1209
01:23:05,012 --> 01:23:06,525
Maybe starve to death.

1210
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:10,443
Why don't you take charge
and lead these people out of here?

1211
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:11,681
I'm no leader.

1212
01:23:11,892 --> 01:23:13,644
I do what I have to do.

1213
01:23:13,772 --> 01:23:15,285
Sometimes people join me.

1214
01:23:15,372 --> 01:23:19,809
I just want to bury Cocteau up to his neck
in shit and let him think happy thoughts.

1215
01:23:20,172 --> 01:23:21,924
Then I got bad news.

1216
01:23:22,652 --> 01:23:24,768
I think he wants to kill you.

1217
01:23:27,452 --> 01:23:29,807
All right gentlemen, let's review.

1218
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:31,891
The year is 2032.

1219
01:23:32,692 --> 01:23:35,331
That's 2-0-3-2. As in the 21st century.

1220
01:23:36,612 --> 01:23:40,605
And I'm sorry to say that
the world has become a pussy-whipped...

1221
01:23:41,492 --> 01:23:45,485
...Brady Bunch version of itself
run by a bunch of robed sissies.

1222
01:23:46,492 --> 01:23:49,165
All we have to do to run the whole thing...

1223
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:53,046
...is to kill a man named Friendly,
who put it all together.

1224
01:23:54,252 --> 01:23:56,641
But there's an extra added bonus.

1225
01:23:58,332 --> 01:23:59,765
We get to kill...

1226
01:23:59,932 --> 01:24:02,162
...the man who put us in the freezer.

1227
01:24:02,332 --> 01:24:03,447
You mean...

1228
01:24:03,612 --> 01:24:05,284
...we get to kill John Spartan?

1229
01:24:05,372 --> 01:24:06,487
Exactly.

1230
01:24:06,812 --> 01:24:09,929
I want you to loot, pillage,
plunder, and steal.

1231
01:24:10,252 --> 01:24:14,530
Do all the wonderful things we used to do
before any of this happened.

1232
01:24:15,252 --> 01:24:17,208
This world will be ours!

1233
01:24:17,412 --> 01:24:19,164
Let's bring back the good old days!

1234
01:24:19,252 --> 01:24:20,571
Are you with me?

1235
01:24:21,252 --> 01:24:23,288
Are you with me? Let's do it!

1236
01:24:26,012 --> 01:24:29,971
It is a curious conclusion
which you have deduced, John Spartan.

1237
01:24:30,812 --> 01:24:33,451
But I can find no fault in your logic.

1238
01:24:33,572 --> 01:24:37,531
Phoenix is the perfect weapon to send
into these savage regions.

1239
01:24:38,212 --> 01:24:40,089
I'm impressed, John Spartan.

1240
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:42,806
They thawed him out just to kill me?

1241
01:24:43,852 --> 01:24:46,844
-I'm flattered.
-Don't be flattered. Be frightened.

1242
01:24:47,092 --> 01:24:49,208
This guy's a certifiable nightmare.

1243
01:24:49,372 --> 01:24:51,283
That's why you're here?

1244
01:24:53,572 --> 01:24:57,008
I must have done something right
in the previous life.

1245
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,881
Can't imagine what that could have been.

1246
01:25:01,772 --> 01:25:03,410
Two for the price of one.

1247
01:25:03,652 --> 01:25:05,244
Let's take them.

1248
01:25:10,012 --> 01:25:11,286
Stay down!

1249
01:25:43,052 --> 01:25:45,850
I'll be damned.
Like a New York cockroach.

1250
01:26:14,372 --> 01:26:16,010
Everything's gone wrong.

1251
01:26:31,852 --> 01:26:34,207
There's an elevator shaft at the top.

1252
01:26:36,412 --> 01:26:37,891
So we're going up?

1253
01:26:38,052 --> 01:26:40,520
Momentito, Seorita Huxley. Come on.

1254
01:26:58,412 --> 01:27:01,006
How nice! Must've been expecting me.

1255
01:27:17,252 --> 01:27:18,446
Now what?

1256
01:27:18,532 --> 01:27:19,851
Buckle up.

1257
01:27:42,332 --> 01:27:44,209
There he is! He's in my car!

1258
01:27:50,012 --> 01:27:51,365
Goddamn it.

1259
01:27:57,692 --> 01:27:59,762
What's happening to cops today?

1260
01:27:59,852 --> 01:28:02,366
Don't you know
you are endangering civilians?

1261
01:28:20,252 --> 01:28:21,082
Auto-inflate!

1262
01:28:21,172 --> 01:28:22,446
Auto-inflate.

1263
01:28:27,772 --> 01:28:28,841
That was lovely.

1264
01:28:28,932 --> 01:28:30,365
Huxley, drive!

1265
01:28:30,892 --> 01:28:33,167
Okay, I've read all about this.

1266
01:28:35,652 --> 01:28:37,847
What do I do? Push this pedal?

1267
01:28:40,172 --> 01:28:41,685
Okay, I got it.

1268
01:28:50,852 --> 01:28:52,126
Punch it!

1269
01:28:52,372 --> 01:28:53,407
Excuse me?

1270
01:28:53,532 --> 01:28:55,921
Push the pedal as hard as you can!

1271
01:29:07,052 --> 01:29:08,246
No free rides!

1272
01:29:13,572 --> 01:29:15,085
Emergency, doors open.

1273
01:29:15,172 --> 01:29:16,366
Doors opening.

1274
01:29:17,612 --> 01:29:19,250
Say hello to my friend.

1275
01:29:31,012 --> 01:29:32,047
Doors close!

1276
01:29:32,132 --> 01:29:33,247
Malfunction.

1277
01:29:38,652 --> 01:29:40,449
Computer, auto-drive.

1278
01:29:40,692 --> 01:29:42,330
Auto-drive engaged.

1279
01:29:42,492 --> 01:29:44,323
Going to give you a haircut!

1280
01:29:45,772 --> 01:29:47,842
Remember the 40 bus passengers...

1281
01:29:47,932 --> 01:29:50,241
...you blew up trying to get me?

1282
01:29:51,572 --> 01:29:53,483
They were already dead.

1283
01:29:53,932 --> 01:29:55,684
Cold as Hagen-Dazs!

1284
01:30:03,452 --> 01:30:05,966
I went to jail with a 36-year smile.

1285
01:30:07,132 --> 01:30:08,531
You're dead.

1286
01:30:08,732 --> 01:30:10,450
Speak for yourself.

1287
01:30:19,292 --> 01:30:20,202
Self-drive!

1288
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:21,964
Unable to execute.

1289
01:30:22,252 --> 01:30:23,844
-Self-drive! Now!
-Malfunction.

1290
01:30:23,932 --> 01:30:25,604
Unable to execute.

1291
01:30:25,852 --> 01:30:26,967
Emergency!

1292
01:30:28,932 --> 01:30:30,001
Brake!

1293
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:32,725
Self-drive engaged.

1294
01:30:34,292 --> 01:30:35,771
Brake! Brake!

1295
01:30:38,012 --> 01:30:40,845
Brake now, you,
Mickey Mouse piece of shit!

1296
01:31:14,172 --> 01:31:15,810
Are you in there?

1297
01:31:17,372 --> 01:31:19,442
Who do you think it is, Huxley?

1298
01:31:27,332 --> 01:31:30,324
I thought your life force
had been prematurely terminated!

1299
01:31:30,412 --> 01:31:32,562
I thought I was history too.

1300
01:31:32,732 --> 01:31:36,327
What happened? All of a sudden,
this car turned into a cannoli.

1301
01:31:36,572 --> 01:31:39,245
It's the curefoam. It saved your life.

1302
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,682
Look at you, you're in shambles.

1303
01:31:41,972 --> 01:31:45,203
I can fix it later.
All I need is a needle and thread.

1304
01:31:45,532 --> 01:31:47,363
Did I really say that?

1305
01:31:56,892 --> 01:31:59,281
You caveman, you're under arrest!

1306
01:31:59,852 --> 01:32:02,320
You're to be returned to the cryo-prison.
Immediately!

1307
01:32:02,412 --> 01:32:05,006
I heard all that. We'll talk later, Chief.

1308
01:32:06,212 --> 01:32:08,965
I need something. A shotgun, a flare gun.

1309
01:32:12,412 --> 01:32:13,242
Shit!

1310
01:32:13,412 --> 01:32:14,845
Defensive red alert!

1311
01:32:16,492 --> 01:32:17,845
Stun batons on.

1312
01:32:19,132 --> 01:32:20,281
Relax.

1313
01:32:21,212 --> 01:32:22,964
Did you bump your noggin...

1314
01:32:23,052 --> 01:32:25,122
...and think you're Pancho Villa?

1315
01:32:25,612 --> 01:32:26,522
Who?

1316
01:32:27,012 --> 01:32:27,842
Never mind.

1317
01:32:27,932 --> 01:32:29,411
Time to take a stand.

1318
01:32:29,492 --> 01:32:32,962
Good. While you're doing it,
loan me a gun. Two guns.

1319
01:32:33,212 --> 01:32:36,966
You'd use these weapons against men
and women who uphold the law?

1320
01:32:37,172 --> 01:32:39,925
We use these weapons
to shop for groceries, dick.

1321
01:32:42,012 --> 01:32:43,331
You can't leave.

1322
01:32:43,532 --> 01:32:48,048
You're under arrest. This very concept
negates the possibility of your leaving.

1323
01:32:48,252 --> 01:32:49,765
Skip it, Chief.

1324
01:32:50,212 --> 01:32:51,884
Lieutenant Huxley!

1325
01:32:52,212 --> 01:32:53,201
Chief...

1326
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:56,329
...you can take this job
and you can shovel it.

1327
01:32:58,772 --> 01:33:00,364
"Take this job...

1328
01:33:00,572 --> 01:33:02,051
"...and shovel it."

1329
01:33:03,612 --> 01:33:05,045
Close enough.

1330
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:14,404
I hadn't counted on this but I must say,
you worked out beautifully.

1331
01:33:15,452 --> 01:33:17,283
People are terrified of you.

1332
01:33:17,612 --> 01:33:20,331
What's new? People have always been
terrified of me.

1333
01:33:20,412 --> 01:33:23,165
But this time they're really intimidated.

1334
01:33:25,332 --> 01:33:26,481
Now...

1335
01:33:26,772 --> 01:33:30,367
...l'll have carte blanche
to create the perfect society.

1336
01:33:31,972 --> 01:33:33,325
My society.

1337
01:33:34,212 --> 01:33:36,965
San Angeles will be a beacon of order...

1338
01:33:37,732 --> 01:33:40,246
...with the purity of an ant colony.

1339
01:33:41,052 --> 01:33:43,520
And the beauty of a flawless pearl.

1340
01:33:44,332 --> 01:33:46,402
People have a right to be assholes.

1341
01:33:48,772 --> 01:33:50,205
You remind me of...

1342
01:33:50,932 --> 01:33:52,490
...an evil Mr. Rogers.

1343
01:33:52,692 --> 01:33:54,205
Will you please kill him?

1344
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:55,771
He's pissing me off.

1345
01:34:06,012 --> 01:34:08,082
Put another log on the fire!

1346
01:34:09,612 --> 01:34:11,648
I'll love running this place!

1347
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:20,011
Well, now...

1348
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:22,442
...what shall I do with you?

1349
01:34:24,092 --> 01:34:26,481
I am an excellent associate, sir.

1350
01:34:27,052 --> 01:34:30,840
I'd be delighted to continue my services
during your administration.

1351
01:34:31,972 --> 01:34:33,246
Maybe we'd use--

1352
01:34:33,332 --> 01:34:35,288
Excuse me, the police are here.

1353
01:34:36,492 --> 01:34:37,720
Oh, man!

1354
01:35:02,692 --> 01:35:04,683
What the hell are you doing?

1355
01:35:22,052 --> 01:35:23,371
I'm impressed.

1356
01:35:36,372 --> 01:35:38,602
That man has died by my hands.

1357
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:40,930
It was either him or us.

1358
01:35:42,332 --> 01:35:43,765
There is that.

1359
01:35:43,972 --> 01:35:46,122
Where'd you learn to kick like that?

1360
01:35:47,332 --> 01:35:49,050
Jackie Chan movies.

1361
01:35:57,172 --> 01:36:00,005
Looks like the Cocteau plan
went up in smoke.

1362
01:36:00,452 --> 01:36:02,727
Rest in peace, Raymond Cocteau.

1363
01:36:03,692 --> 01:36:07,480
John Spartan, civilization as we know it
will come to an end.

1364
01:36:08,492 --> 01:36:09,561
What will we do?

1365
01:36:09,652 --> 01:36:12,120
I don't know. But this is better for you.

1366
01:36:12,292 --> 01:36:13,691
What's that?

1367
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:19,771
This is bad.

1368
01:36:20,052 --> 01:36:21,246
This is very bad.

1369
01:36:21,332 --> 01:36:25,166
He's accessed the cryo-prison
and is about to defrost the multi-lifers.

1370
01:36:25,292 --> 01:36:26,725
They don't like you.

1371
01:36:26,892 --> 01:36:30,248
Most of these guys don't like
their own mothers. They're bad boys.

1372
01:36:30,332 --> 01:36:31,731
How many are there?

1373
01:36:34,812 --> 01:36:35,767
Eighty.

1374
01:36:36,052 --> 01:36:37,405
All without rehab.

1375
01:36:37,492 --> 01:36:39,369
They'll be re-animated within the hour.

1376
01:36:39,452 --> 01:36:41,124
We must stop this.

1377
01:36:42,932 --> 01:36:47,164
I'm not at all pleased about having caused
the fatality of a convict.

1378
01:36:47,412 --> 01:36:51,451
I now understand that under certain
circumstances violence is necessary.

1379
01:36:51,652 --> 01:36:52,767
Good.

1380
01:36:57,292 --> 01:36:59,362
I hope you understand this.

1381
01:37:07,972 --> 01:37:10,202
I hope my butt didn't look like that.

1382
01:37:10,372 --> 01:37:13,011
Okay, who do we have left that's good?

1383
01:37:13,172 --> 01:37:14,287
Let's see...

1384
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:15,845
...Foulks, Patrick.

1385
01:37:16,012 --> 01:37:18,401
Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy.

1386
01:37:19,452 --> 01:37:21,090
How long before the rest are done?

1387
01:37:21,172 --> 01:37:23,083
They're in the final stages of reanimation.

1388
01:37:23,172 --> 01:37:24,924
Great. Absolutely great.

1389
01:37:26,652 --> 01:37:27,721
Gentlemen!

1390
01:37:28,252 --> 01:37:31,562
Thank you, but your services
are no longer required.

1391
01:37:38,372 --> 01:37:40,681
Send a maniac to catch a maniac.

1392
01:37:58,132 --> 01:37:59,406
Attention.

1393
01:37:59,572 --> 01:38:00,891
Attention.

1394
01:38:00,972 --> 01:38:03,645
Cryo-prisoner defrosting
re-animation sequence...

1395
01:38:03,732 --> 01:38:05,882
...now entering final stage.

1396
01:38:07,732 --> 01:38:10,724
Count down to reanimation
ofprisoner batches...

1397
01:38:10,932 --> 01:38:12,650
...290, 310, 480...

1398
01:38:14,852 --> 01:38:16,046
...570.

1399
01:38:16,372 --> 01:38:17,725
Ten minutes.

1400
01:38:19,732 --> 01:38:22,292
-That's it. The very last one.
-Excellent.

1401
01:38:23,692 --> 01:38:24,966
Accessed.

1402
01:38:26,612 --> 01:38:28,284
What the hell is that?

1403
01:39:03,372 --> 01:39:05,408
Didn't expect that, did you?

1404
01:39:05,772 --> 01:39:07,125
Where are you going?

1405
01:39:07,212 --> 01:39:09,043
I wish you the best of luck.

1406
01:39:10,012 --> 01:39:10,967
Stupid.

1407
01:39:18,372 --> 01:39:20,010
How's it hanging?

1408
01:39:21,532 --> 01:39:24,524
I'm sure you're familiar
with the long arm of the law.

1409
01:39:29,332 --> 01:39:32,290
Why don't you struggle a little bit?
Make me work for it!

1410
01:39:32,372 --> 01:39:34,169
What do you say? How about...

1411
01:39:34,252 --> 01:39:37,210
...a little target practice. What do you say?

1412
01:39:45,092 --> 01:39:46,730
Did that hurt your head?

1413
01:40:06,212 --> 01:40:07,725
Shit! Goddamn!

1414
01:40:15,012 --> 01:40:15,888
Fuck!

1415
01:40:27,492 --> 01:40:28,811
That's it!

1416
01:40:29,332 --> 01:40:31,448
You won't get out of this one!

1417
01:40:34,332 --> 01:40:36,846
I'll drop you in that vat of defrost...

1418
01:40:37,012 --> 01:40:39,003
...and fry you like a chicken...

1419
01:40:40,172 --> 01:40:43,130
...or with my little pinky,
drop your monkey ass--

1420
01:40:45,652 --> 01:40:47,165
I'll be damned.

1421
01:41:26,852 --> 01:41:28,080
Shit! Goddamn!

1422
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:29,287
What am I doing wrong?

1423
01:41:29,492 --> 01:41:31,244
Cryo-prisoner re-animation...

1424
01:41:31,372 --> 01:41:33,966
...sequence now entering final stage.

1425
01:41:40,372 --> 01:41:42,966
"Is it cold in here, or is it just me?"

1426
01:41:44,612 --> 01:41:46,011
Good memory.

1427
01:41:52,092 --> 01:41:53,320
Come here!

1428
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:54,847
Shit!

1429
01:42:05,252 --> 01:42:06,651
I hate cops!

1430
01:42:10,812 --> 01:42:13,280
Look into my eyes. I'll see you in hell.

1431
01:42:13,692 --> 01:42:14,602
Not.

1432
01:42:56,052 --> 01:42:58,361
This is the best day of my life.

1433
01:43:27,572 --> 01:43:28,846
Heads up!

1434
01:44:17,732 --> 01:44:21,486
Did you apprehend the villain responsible
for murdering Cocteau?

1435
01:44:21,692 --> 01:44:23,489
I wouldn't say "apprehend."

1436
01:44:23,652 --> 01:44:25,085
But he's history.

1437
01:44:25,332 --> 01:44:26,890
And the cryo-prison...

1438
01:44:27,012 --> 01:44:28,411
...is history too.

1439
01:44:31,252 --> 01:44:32,731
What'll we do?

1440
01:44:33,652 --> 01:44:34,721
How will we live?

1441
01:44:34,812 --> 01:44:38,407
We'll go out drinking,
get shit-faced and paint the town.

1442
01:44:38,692 --> 01:44:40,808
Graffiti slogans, it'll be a blast.

1443
01:44:41,292 --> 01:44:42,691
This is what you'll do.

1444
01:44:42,772 --> 01:44:44,603
You'll get a little dirty...

1445
01:44:44,692 --> 01:44:46,364
...you, a lot clean.

1446
01:44:46,572 --> 01:44:48,608
And somewhere in the middle....

1447
01:44:49,372 --> 01:44:51,169
You'll figure it out.

1448
01:44:51,492 --> 01:44:52,641
Fucking-A!

1449
01:44:55,692 --> 01:44:56,920
Well put.

1450
01:44:58,452 --> 01:45:00,488
Greetings and salutations.

1451
01:45:00,652 --> 01:45:02,927
I'm Associate Bob. And may I say...

1452
01:45:03,092 --> 01:45:06,368
...it would be a pleasure
to help you create a more humane--

1453
01:45:07,572 --> 01:45:09,244
Let's talk about the hair, okay?

1454
01:45:09,332 --> 01:45:12,881
Pick a color. And lose the kimono.
You look like a couch.

1455
01:45:13,012 --> 01:45:15,446
What are you, a surgeon
with these gloves?

1456
01:45:19,292 --> 01:45:21,806
Thanks for rendering me unconscious.

1457
01:45:23,732 --> 01:45:25,131
I did it for your own good.

1458
01:45:25,212 --> 01:45:27,442
-We're supposed to be a team.
-We are.

1459
01:45:36,052 --> 01:45:37,246
