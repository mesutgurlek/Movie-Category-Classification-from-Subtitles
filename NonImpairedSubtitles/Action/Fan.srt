1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:49,417
---------------------SupunWE------------------------------

2
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:53,895
Connection is a strange thing!
Don't ask how it works

3
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:02,620
Our friendship goes back years

4
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:05,672
Our connection is stronger than
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth

5
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:08,471
The best actor award goes to
Aryan Khanna

6
00:01:08,748 --> 00:01:12,361
First time I'm getting an award,
a major award in the film industry

7
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:14,148
This one's for you, Ma

8
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:15,778
Thank you very much

9
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,439
Before I could walk, I learned
how to jump like Aryan

10
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:23,897
Aryan? The moron!

11
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:27,606
Anyone insults him

12
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:28,940
I fight

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,144
If I copy his style...

14
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:37,618
...I get whacked

15
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,202
I don't think I've done enough work.
It's just been 5 years

16
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,786
I still have a long way to go
as an actor and star

17
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,262
I'll work hard and prove
I'm a genuine superstar

18
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:50,500
I never compare

19
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,577
What is better is to say you are the
best, not bother about others

20
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:56,400
You're the greatest.
But I'm better

21
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:00,071
Never met him. But I spend
all day with him

22
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:03,285
That's real connection

23
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:08,368
Whatever he does, I cut, copy,
paste, and ditto

24
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:10,410
Tiny difference

25
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,160
He became a star

26
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:14,660
And I became his fan

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,202
And something else

28
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:22,173
We live together

29
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:26,243
In one cinema or the other

30
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,956
The real drama will start now!

31
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:48,535
None of my achievements
are my own

32
00:02:48,988 --> 00:02:51,996
I am who I am today,
I am where I am today

33
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:53,535
It's all thanks to my fans

34
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:57,375
Without my fans, I'm nothing

35
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,327
Can't you even get 40% marks?

36
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:03,376
It's always Aryan, Aryan

37
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:13,410
My parents don't get it

38
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:16,559
He's not just a star,
he's my world

39
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,194
But God bowled a great googly

40
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:22,644
When God was making Aryan,
some clay was left behind...

41
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,312
...God made me with that

42
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:29,920
He and I are different.
Poles apart

43
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,080
But we are one

44
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:37,368
He is Aryan and me, Junior Aryan

45
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,669
I topped up your phone.
200 rupees

46
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:08,669
Send the money tomorrow

47
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,017
Don't worry

48
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:11,544
Tomorrow is fine

49
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,461
The shop is closing now

50
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:15,794
Check your phone

51
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:18,294
You're a gem. Bye, aunty

52
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:22,711
Batman, Superman!
Enough slaughter

53
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,962
Shut down now. Kill the bad guys
tomorrow

54
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:27,801
- Gaurav, what's this?
- It's only 5.30, bro

55
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:31,810
Don't act smart. I told you.
You're out by 5.30

56
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:34,129
Go home, kids

57
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,165
Don't mess with me

58
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:45,087
All well?

59
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,337
Miss Call Center, where were you?
I'm closing

60
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:50,296
So early?

61
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:52,566
- I have a show
- 5 minutes. Please

62
00:04:52,987 --> 00:04:55,087
No. I'll be late

63
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,796
Only 5 minutes

64
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:58,629
It's urgent

65
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,129
I need a recommendation letter
for my US visa

66
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,504
I have a costume trial

67
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,717
Can you do it later? Ok then

68
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,786
Thanks

69
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:08,576
5 minutes

70
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:11,504
You don't let us stay and for her...

71
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,405
Her work is urgent. You just
shoot partridges

72
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,254
I get what's urgent

73
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,593
Come back tomorrow

74
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:22,421
Get lost!

75
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:26,836
You losers

76
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:43,702
Sitting here dreaming of America
won't help you

77
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:47,124
But staring at Aryan's photo
will help you?

78
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:51,493
- Two minutes to go
- All done

79
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:54,952
Thank you

80
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,607
How much?

81
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:03,952
Forget it. Can't charge you
for 5 minutes

82
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,202
- Thanks
- Enjoy!

83
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,535
Brothers, the shop is closed

84
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:16,785
So the action just left?

85
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:18,827
What's 30 minutes?

86
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,160
I put this notice up a week ago

87
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:23,202
Due to the grand Dussehra show

88
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,149
Organised by the Resident Welfare
Assoc. Inder Vihar, DDA Colony

89
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:29,687
AK Cyber Chat closes
at 5:30 sharp

90
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,321
By order Gaurav Chandna,
proprietor AK Cyber Chat

91
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:34,958
See you again

92
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:39,133
If I knew English well, I'd be
a computer myself

93
00:06:40,522 --> 00:06:43,683
The shop won't stay open,
even for the Prime Minister

94
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:45,910
I said it's closed. You'll get
extra time tomorrow

95
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:46,910
You photocopy!

96
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:48,743
Don't be cruel like Ravan

97
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:52,094
This boy needs to watch porn.
He's upset

98
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,785
I don't heal upset minds
at Cyber Chat

99
00:06:57,172 --> 00:07:00,952
No porn films allowed here anyway.
Out, you guys!

100
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:05,520
You better outgrow Aryan Khanna.
Sid Kapoor is the man now

101
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:08,730
Get smart, photocopy

102
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,577
The shop in Sector 28 is open

103
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:14,359
- Go there
- Don't you dare touch me!

104
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,577
- Don't touch
- Here, I'm touching

105
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,193
Get out of here

106
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:56,984
Let go! They need a lesson

107
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:59,232
Want to see porn? Huh...

108
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:01,345
What are you doing?

109
00:08:02,186 --> 00:08:05,774
Nothing. I let you chat.
So they made trouble

110
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:07,274
I'm fine

111
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:09,066
You can all go. Thank you!

112
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:10,848
The jobless morons

113
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,149
They came to watch blue films.
I whacked them

114
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:20,424
Why play the hero?
Why didn't you call for help?

115
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,473
But I did call you

116
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:26,522
My heart did

117
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,399
So you came back

118
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:33,646
Please, Gaurav. Stop talking
like Aryan

119
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:36,399
Drop it. Coming to the show tonight?

120
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:39,179
Too much to do. I don't
have time like you

121
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:41,566
Today's a birthday special

122
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:43,524
No, thank you

123
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:44,682
Welcome

124
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,791
How did you get hurt?

125
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:58,816
Who hit you? I'll complain to
the association

126
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:01,344
It's fine. Don't ruin my concentration

127
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,733
Concentration? You can't move.
How will you go on stage?

128
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,775
The prize is 20,000. Cash!

129
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:14,066
You won't give me 20,000
to go and meet Aryan

130
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,775
My only chance to fulfill my dream

131
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,558
I don't have money to burn
on your silly dreams

132
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:23,941
What about your Tuesday trips
to the Hanuman temple?

133
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:26,922
Doesn't your 101-rupee donation
go up in smoke?

134
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,066
Hanumanji is a God.
And your Aryan...

135
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:32,560
He's important to me

136
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:36,191
Every fool has met him,
only I haven't

137
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:37,900
Spray some scent on me

138
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:44,150
- Careful
- If you can't do it, never mind

139
00:09:44,441 --> 00:09:46,752
My fans are waiting. Get ready

140
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:49,193
Listen to your mother.
Stop your drama

141
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,985
The real drama starts now

142
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,312
Hold on to your hearts

143
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,816
You're about to see a performance...

144
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:02,363
...that the Western Union,
moving money for better...

145
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:06,025
...Super Star competition
can never do without

146
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:09,080
You guessed right

147
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:13,066
Here he comes.
The two-year winner:

148
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:16,605
Our Aryan Khanna Junior

149
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,233
Jindal aunty!

150
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,573
Your pressure cooker on the stove?

151
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,107
The only whistle you'll hear
today is right here

152
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,145
My hattrick year

153
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:07,407
Today I'll share something personal

154
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,398
About me and Aryan

155
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:11,512
I hide nothing from you

156
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:15,073
I'm no ace at romancing

157
00:11:15,782 --> 00:11:19,615
But when I see her, my emotions
go haywire

158
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:21,981
Words escape me

159
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:28,573
Senior is an expert heart-stealer.
So I asked him...

160
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:32,032
...to help his Junior

161
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,198
It's delicate. I must tread carefully

162
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:45,240
Don't forget

163
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,115
The heart's job is to beat

164
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:51,296
When you count the night stars...

165
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,615
...and yearn to etch my name
on every star

166
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:57,532
You know you're in love

167
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:00,907
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead

168
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,316
When you look for me
in a crowd

169
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:08,323
You know you're in love

170
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:11,053
If you don't believe me

171
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,698
Then hold my hand

172
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:17,615
If your heart stops, then you know...

173
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,924
...you're in love

174
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:25,782
I don't have your style, Senior

175
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,175
But if anyone insults you...

176
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:30,865
...I want to break their teeth

177
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,898
Mummy says, Calm down

178
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,445
Aryan is India's sweetheart

179
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,716
But he's a Delhi boy after all

180
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,657
Come, Senior. Let's show them
some Delhi muscle

181
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:26,534
Ma used to say: Don't weigh
the food you're eating

182
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:32,764
Don't count the guys you whack

183
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,349
Here

184
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:43,461
Use this

185
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:49,909
I feel like just staring
at the screen

186
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:51,863
I have this dream

187
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:54,532
Keep doing your thing
with your heroines

188
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:57,263
I've been your fan forever

189
00:13:57,846 --> 00:13:59,804
I think you owe me a dance

190
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:01,556
We'll have a blast

191
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:04,846
No one will tell who is Senior,
who is Junior. Hit it!

192
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,641
One last thing before I go

193
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,641
I am what I am today

194
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:30,641
I am where I am today

195
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:34,317
It's all thanks to my fans

196
00:15:35,641 --> 00:15:37,224
Without my fans

197
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:40,266
I'm nothing

198
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:45,641
Brothers and sisters!

199
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:48,576
The Virat act did not impress us

200
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:51,302
The Katrina act did not impress

201
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,307
This year like every other year

202
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:57,444
The Western Union, moving money
for better...

203
00:15:57,682 --> 00:16:01,380
Super Star competition's trophy
goes to our very own...

204
00:16:02,469 --> 00:16:03,927
Gaurav Chandna

205
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:11,338
Give him a big hand!

206
00:16:25,997 --> 00:16:28,141
I want to thank my Mummy

207
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,432
My Papa

208
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:33,557
My God

209
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:37,194
The greatest actor in the world

210
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:39,957
The Aryan Khanna

211
00:16:57,896 --> 00:16:58,731
Ok, go

212
00:16:59,638 --> 00:17:02,427
But why travel without a ticket?

213
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,844
- Go later
- Later?

214
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:10,261
Aryan's birthday is in 2 days.
And I must wait to book a ticket?

215
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:13,533
The ticket collector will catch you
and belt you

216
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,427
Remind her...

217
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,019
...how Aryan travelled to Mumbai
for the first time

218
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:20,638
- WT
- Without ticket!

219
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:24,436
You want to give him the trophy?
Courier it. Post it

220
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:26,851
Papa, count the cash again

221
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,719
Phony fans cheer him from afar

222
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:34,605
But I'll hug him and hand him
the trophy myself

223
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:37,302
- Like this
- Have you gone mad?

224
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:39,177
Control the boy

225
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:41,386
Here. 20,000

226
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,404
Is your spit on the notes?

227
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:47,944
Socks, in the outside pocket.
Underwear, inside the bag

228
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:50,658
Any extra underwear? I'll have
no time to wash them

229
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,449
Here. Give this to him from
your Papa and me

230
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,737
Sohan halwa

231
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:59,687
Tell him your father got it
especially for him

232
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:03,112
- From Chandni Chowk
- Why tell him? I'll show him

233
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,347
I'll show Aryan a family selfie.
Come, we'll get the background

234
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:10,598
Mummy, hold the box.
I'll hold the trophy

235
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:12,663
Papa, hide those undies

236
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:15,574
- Cheese
- Cheese!

237
00:18:16,281 --> 00:18:18,823
- Shall I drop you at the station?
- No, you go to the shop

238
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,781
- Can you manage?
- Sure

239
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:22,239
Don't overstay at Aryan's

240
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:24,656
I've only four days leave.
Can't extend

241
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:26,698
Don't worry, Papa. By mummy

242
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,364
Be careful, son

243
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:32,156
Where to?

244
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:33,281
Hi!

245
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,430
Your parents throw you out?

246
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,906
Keep dreaming about moving
to America

247
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:42,489
I'm off to meet Aryan,
face-to-face

248
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,198
Told Aryan you're coming?

249
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:48,288
He's my Aryan, not America.
No visa needed

250
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:52,698
I'm going to America to make a new
life. You'll get zero meeting Aryan

251
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:57,406
Forget it, you won't understand

252
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:49,989
Hello, uncle

253
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,281
Hello, aunty

254
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:58,323
Your ice cream

255
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,733
One vegetarian meal

256
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:04,114
Seat number?

257
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:10,115
100

258
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:13,953
I'll get it

259
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,276
If you want to stretch your legs
or your back, tell me

260
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:22,634
It's only one night. We'll adjust

261
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:30,953
Allow me

262
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:33,073
Now it's ok

263
00:20:37,765 --> 00:20:41,143
Let me put uncle's plate down.
Don't worry

264
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:01,285
We're coming

265
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,385
Without ticket?

266
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:10,431
Uncle, it's a long story

267
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:12,973
Let me explain

268
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:17,312
I'll do the explaining. Call
Ratlam police station

269
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:20,514
Let him spend two days inside.
No more WT travelling

270
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:23,223
Uncle, you don't get it. I could've
bought the ticket

271
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:26,629
- I want to travel without one
- Come along

272
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:29,441
I'm not a thief or a criminal

273
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:32,306
You see tomorrow is
Aryan Khanna's birthday

274
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:33,931
No point if I get there late

275
00:21:34,264 --> 00:21:34,806
Aryan Khanna?

276
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:37,359
Right! He went to Mumbai WT

277
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,389
Stayed at Hotel Delite.
Room number 205

278
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,211
I'll be staying there too.
Get the picture?

279
00:21:42,774 --> 00:21:45,264
Let me get to Mumbai.
You won't lose anything

280
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:48,369
Here's the ticket money. Keep it

281
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:50,056
- But I'll travel WT
- Shut up!

282
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,598
You need a tight slap

283
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:55,056
Take him. He won't listen

284
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,681
Damn you!

285
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,428
Take me to Mumbai. Or I'll jump

286
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:05,723
You'll be answering the cops
all night

287
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:07,764
Want to die? Get back inside

288
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:10,657
If I can't see Aryan Khanna
on his birthday...

289
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:12,389
...no point living

290
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,058
Don't lose your head over
these film stars

291
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:18,014
He may be a film star to you.
But he's special to me

292
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:19,889
Give me your hand or you'll die

293
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:22,681
- Take me to Mumbai
- OK! Give me your hand

294
00:22:23,078 --> 00:22:26,374
- One veg meal?
- Done. Give me your hand

295
00:22:27,163 --> 00:22:27,959
Ok, hold me

296
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:40,473
Is he a relative? Do you
really know him?

297
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:43,837
Is he family? What are you
to Aryan Khanna?

298
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:47,802
A fan

299
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,892
Room 205 is occupied

300
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:17,517
Why? I've booked it

301
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:19,434
No bookings here

302
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:21,977
First come, first serve.
Pay cash, take the key

303
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,142
I'll pay double

304
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,034
But only room 205

305
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:34,903
If you don't give it to me,
just see what I'll do

306
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:43,601
Hey boy! Move the stuff from 205
to 209

307
00:23:44,678 --> 00:23:47,427
Here, brother. Room 205 for you

308
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:20,533
Happy birthday, Senior

309
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:04,488
Let me pass, brother. I'm late.
Move it!

310
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:14,127
What a crowd! By God

311
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:16,293
Brother, move aside

312
00:25:24,193 --> 00:25:25,432
The press over there

313
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:30,118
Let them come in

314
00:25:32,048 --> 00:25:34,128
A selfie! Smile

315
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:37,628
Thank you

316
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,234
These two-faced fans

317
00:25:43,473 --> 00:25:45,174
They moan about his films

318
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:49,106
And come here to pose with him

319
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:52,042
You can't go there

320
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:56,164
I'm not one of them. Those FB types.
Phony fans

321
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,641
I'm Gaurav Chandna

322
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:02,292
I've come from Delhi. WT.
Rajdhani Express

323
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:04,627
Guess where I'm staying?

324
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,243
Guess!

325
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:12,875
Hotel Delite. Room number 205

326
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,667
Don't you get it?

327
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,375
I'll show you magic

328
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,375
You'll enjoy it. Look!

329
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,334
When you count the night stars...

330
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:29,084
...and yearn to etch her name
on every star

331
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:32,125
You know you're in love

332
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,122
When her breath is carried
by the breeze...

333
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,917
Lets go press

334
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,085
You know you're in love

335
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:41,828
When you turn back as you walk ahead

336
00:26:41,993 --> 00:26:43,112
Check the press IDs

337
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,088
Go inside

338
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:49,000
Not you! Don't you get it?

339
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,959
I want to show him my trophy

340
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,989
I just want him to see it.
Then I'll be gone

341
00:26:59,165 --> 00:27:00,049
Moron!

342
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,584
If Aryan ever hears that
you hit me...

343
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:04,667
...he'll thrash you

344
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:08,375
It's ok. It's nothing

345
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:21,209
Mummy sent you special halwa

346
00:28:22,787 --> 00:28:26,970
And this trophy...your birthday.
Mummy sent special halwa

347
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:27,399
Yes, Mummy?

348
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:29,490
I'm fine

349
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:32,391
Aryan is fine, too

350
00:29:33,491 --> 00:29:36,253
I haven't met him yet. You're talking
like a child, Mummy

351
00:29:36,535 --> 00:29:38,949
He's a superstar. How can
I just meet him?

352
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,866
There are thousands of people
here to meet him

353
00:29:42,236 --> 00:29:44,585
They've built a 50 ft wall
in front of him

354
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,657
The poor guy is stuck alone behind it

355
00:29:48,514 --> 00:29:52,157
Scream as hard as you want,
he can't hear

356
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:58,238
I'm hanging up. I'll call later

357
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:14,104
They say common sense deserts
a man in bad times

358
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,812
Seems that's Aryan Khanna's
fate now

359
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:20,718
In his twilight years, his films
are bombing

360
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:24,217
No surprise that he's on edge
and snappy

361
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:28,234
On his 48th birthday, he showed
his irritation...

362
00:30:28,738 --> 00:30:30,817
...through his gift to Sid Kapoor

363
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,394
No star has matched Aryan till now

364
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,564
But Sid Kapoor...

365
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:39,394
...has pulled the rug
from under his feet

366
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,789
The party guests said...

367
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:45,015
Sid Kapoor just hinted that...

368
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:47,892
...Aryan Khanna's days were over

369
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:50,570
What did Kapoor tell Aryan Khanna...

370
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:53,984
...that made him hit Sid Kapoor?

371
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:56,254
I went to wish him happy birthday

372
00:30:56,705 --> 00:31:00,035
Look what he did to me!
Totally out of order

373
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,201
He's an elder. I respect him a lot

374
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,872
I always say I've learned how
to act by watching his films

375
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,161
I don't know why I make him
insecure

376
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:13,788
What will you do?
Take legal action?

377
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:15,205
I should

378
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:17,568
I'll talk to my legal team

379
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:21,372
Let's see what they say.
It's my duty to do something

380
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:25,997
So no newcomer is mistreated
by a senior star

381
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,425
That's all I want to say

382
00:31:29,828 --> 00:31:33,054
We'll talk after I've consulted
my legal team

383
00:31:44,473 --> 00:31:46,013
Liar! Cheat

384
00:31:46,855 --> 00:31:50,161
Playing the good boy on TV.
Anyone can see through you

385
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:53,485
You think he's insecure?

386
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:56,698
He's seen off dozens like you

387
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:59,178
No one has touched Aryan Khanna
for 25 years

388
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:02,181
Do your worst, sonny!

389
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:05,441
No one can touch him

390
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:07,108
Just you wait

391
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:22,390
Cut it!

392
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:32,098
Great shot

393
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:33,598
Superb!

394
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:35,306
- Liked it?
- Fantastic

395
00:32:46,904 --> 00:32:49,666
Sid Kapoor! You swallowed
Aryan Khanna whole

396
00:32:53,587 --> 00:32:55,239
What dialogue delivery!

397
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,666
You've destroyed Aryan Khanna.
Blew him away

398
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:04,913
I am your biggest fan, sir

399
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:07,205
At the contest back home...

400
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:10,330
It's my bad luck I look like Aryan,
but I always impersonate you

401
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,580
I win, sir

402
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,330
I've even won a trophy.
I love you, sir

403
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,705
Let me show you my trophy, sir.
Please...

404
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,705
- You let the girls through
- Let him come

405
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,413
Sir says yes

406
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:24,621
Sorry. Give me space

407
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:28,555
I'll show you my act?

408
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:29,580
Ok

409
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,525
The mind always outsmarts
the face, Mr. Singhania

410
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,121
You can ape someone

411
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,179
But you can't ape his mind

412
00:33:48,657 --> 00:33:50,705
When all doors are shut

413
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,394
There's a knock at mind's door

414
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:57,097
And when that door opens,
you see a new road

415
00:33:58,224 --> 00:34:00,621
I have walked that road to you,
Singhania

416
00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:07,163
And through that very door
you shall walk to your peril

417
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:10,705
You're too good, fan

418
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:13,413
Well done, man

419
00:34:15,631 --> 00:34:17,208
Relax man, calm down

420
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,864
I have the same jacket you're wearing

421
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:24,580
That's good. Very nice

422
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,663
- Sir's lunch break now
- One chance, sir

423
00:34:29,787 --> 00:34:32,330
Santosh, bring me the salad
in half an hour

424
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:35,104
And this fan, come on!

425
00:34:35,736 --> 00:34:36,746
Hear that?

426
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:41,538
- Sit down
- No, thank you

427
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,038
Sir, a small suggestion from a fan

428
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,891
Why fight with Aryan Khanna?

429
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:54,002
Why bother with the police
and police reports?

430
00:34:54,362 --> 00:34:55,455
That's nothing, bro

431
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,996
I'll drag him to court

432
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:00,015
Allow me

433
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:02,775
Time's up for Aryan Khanna

434
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,455
- I'll wring your neck
- Santosh!

435
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,955
To hell with Santosh

436
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:14,788
Shut up! No one is coming

437
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,386
Close your mouth

438
00:35:21,104 --> 00:35:22,718
Now listen... sit quietly...

439
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:27,710
Don't open your mouth again
to insult Aryan. One peep and...

440
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:31,074
I'll crush your chocolate face
with the wrapper

441
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:36,569
No fan will look at you again

442
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:43,073
Spouting pearls of wisdom on TV.
Look at my camera

443
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:46,771
Read! Here's the script.
Learn the lines

444
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:48,896
Do your rubbish acting

445
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,230
Your damn phone never
stops ringing

446
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:02,313
Now I'll see

447
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:04,563
Read it!

448
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:09,050
Start

449
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:14,565
It's in Hindi, dude

450
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:20,938
You're a Hindi film hero
and you can't read Hindi?

451
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:23,563
Where do they find you guys?

452
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:27,688
What do you film people say?

453
00:36:29,134 --> 00:36:29,896
Action!

454
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:31,320
Dear Aryan sir

455
00:36:31,915 --> 00:36:33,605
I'm really very sorry

456
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,355
My statement to the press
was all lies

457
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,396
I wanted to spoil your name

458
00:36:40,188 --> 00:36:42,480
No one can take your place.
You're the best

459
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:46,188
The greatest, the most evergreen
super-duper star

460
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:49,355
I apologise again

461
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:53,104
Think of me as your kid brother
and forgive me

462
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,396
Why won't he play with you?
Shall I tell him to?

463
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:58,355
Dad, he bullies me

464
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:01,970
He bullies you because
he's scared of you

465
00:37:02,174 --> 00:37:04,710
He thinks you'll win. We'll cheat!

466
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:07,100
- Dhruv, let's play
- Dad, come on

467
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,771
Play with Isha. I've trained her

468
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,142
- I am so sorry
- Dad, you made me lose a point

469
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:19,141
Now she's ahead of you.
Try and win from her

470
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:25,642
I'm glad Sid realised his mistake.
He's a great guy. Young and new

471
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:27,764
Glad it got sorted

472
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:32,624
Ladies and gentlemen,
last point, next point

473
00:37:33,537 --> 00:37:35,982
Nothing is sorted, it's a game

474
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:40,302
Apology, say sorry - it's all a game

475
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:43,608
You should've controlled yourself

476
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,143
I tried very hard

477
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:47,275
I gave him one slap. More a pat

478
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:50,938
See the scandal it's created

479
00:37:51,865 --> 00:37:54,622
If someone comes to my house,
drinks my expensive wine

480
00:37:54,935 --> 00:37:57,688
Flirts with my wife. Must I just
stand by and watch?

481
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:00,335
You have no time

482
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:02,528
Let someone else flirt with me

483
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:05,255
Actually you're right

484
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:08,921
But not this moron

485
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:13,645
The video has gone viral.
Social media is abuzz

486
00:38:14,456 --> 00:38:17,838
Join us for the stock market news
after this short break

487
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:42,143
Aryan, wake up!

488
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:44,482
What happened?

489
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,266
Did you sleep here all night?

490
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:50,296
I was reading a script. It was
so good that I dozed off

491
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:54,671
Sunaina is here. She has something
to wake you up with

492
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:56,005
Good morning, Aryan

493
00:38:56,255 --> 00:38:57,380
It's too early, Sunaina

494
00:38:57,582 --> 00:39:00,616
I know. I'm really sorry.
I have to tell you something

495
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:02,808
- Are you pregnant?
- Shut up, Aryan

496
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:05,130
See this

497
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:08,553
Come on. Look here and say
your lines. Hurry

498
00:39:09,582 --> 00:39:10,416
Dear Aryan sir

499
00:39:10,657 --> 00:39:12,563
Look here. Look at the camera

500
00:39:14,456 --> 00:39:16,220
Ok. I'll do it

501
00:39:18,241 --> 00:39:20,088
- Come on
- Did Aryan send you?

502
00:39:20,426 --> 00:39:23,902
Aryan has nothing to do with it.
Do as you're told. The camera

503
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:27,995
If you want cash, take it.
Just let me go

504
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:31,306
Cash? I'll give you cash

505
00:39:31,697 --> 00:39:33,454
Stop! I'll do it

506
00:39:34,295 --> 00:39:36,213
What will you do? Scum!

507
00:39:55,762 --> 00:39:56,532
A fan

508
00:39:57,651 --> 00:39:59,568
Calls himself Junior Aryan Khanna

509
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:01,651
He sent a message

510
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,360
A small birthday gift to the love
of my life, Senior Aryan Khanna

511
00:40:06,506 --> 00:40:10,114
Call me once to thank me.
My life will be set

512
00:40:20,443 --> 00:40:21,068
Hello

513
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,943
Junior Aryan Khanna?

514
00:40:26,735 --> 00:40:28,276
You calling from Aryan's house?

515
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:29,818
Yes

516
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,026
Where is Senior? Aryan Khanna?

517
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,068
He's busy right now. He asked me
to call you

518
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:42,735
How come he's so busy?
No time to talk to his Junior?

519
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:44,651
I did so much for him

520
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:47,485
I came to the house on his birthday,
The crowd...

521
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:49,151
Yeah, yeah, hello

522
00:40:52,893 --> 00:40:53,651
Aryan...

523
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,834
Aryan Khanna?

524
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,401
Gaurav this side.
Your fan, your Junior

525
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,526
Where are you?

526
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:06,360
Just guess

527
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:13,110
Delite hotel, in your room

528
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:17,276
Room no. 205. Charni Road.
Remember?

529
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:22,021
But if you're calling to say
thank you, it won't do

530
00:41:22,486 --> 00:41:24,568
I deserve a hug from my brother

531
00:41:26,677 --> 00:41:28,156
- You want to see me?
- Sure

532
00:41:28,396 --> 00:41:30,485
I made a big scandal just to meet you

533
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,838
Wait there. I'll send a car to
pick you up

534
00:41:37,346 --> 00:41:38,151
Done, Senior

535
00:41:39,044 --> 00:41:40,298
Thank you!

536
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,693
Mind blasting

537
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:51,151
Really?

538
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:53,800
Go by taxi

539
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:57,668
You're going to Aryan Khanna's.
Don't go by auto-rickshaw

540
00:41:57,901 --> 00:42:00,709
He's sending me his personal car

541
00:42:00,942 --> 00:42:02,391
He's invited me home

542
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:04,712
Don't forget to take pictures

543
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:09,068
If he offers you any food, no
pouncing on it like a pauper

544
00:42:09,464 --> 00:42:13,766
Food? I'm not going for the food.
I'm going there to hug him

545
00:42:14,029 --> 00:42:18,302
Tell him to wear the clothes I had
made for him at Diwali

546
00:42:18,888 --> 00:42:22,679
- Make sure he takes the trophy
- As though he wouldn't

547
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:27,727
- Say hello from me
- And me, too

548
00:42:28,072 --> 00:42:28,876
Ok. I'll tell him

549
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:31,563
Phone me once you've met him

550
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,417
The car's here. Call you later

551
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:37,135
The car is there

552
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:43,120
Hello

553
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:50,951
Are you the driver?

554
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:53,076
Junior Aryan Khanna?

555
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:56,481
- Did you act smart with Sid Kapoor?
- No

556
00:42:58,463 --> 00:42:59,691
You're mistaken

557
00:43:01,226 --> 00:43:02,441
Did Sid Kapoor send you?

558
00:43:02,824 --> 00:43:04,542
I'll tell you later. Come

559
00:43:04,992 --> 00:43:07,898
I'm meeting Aryan.
I won't go anywhere

560
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,191
- Like hell you won't
- I won't come

561
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:14,418
Don't touch me

562
00:43:16,605 --> 00:43:17,386
No touching

563
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,025
Let me go!

564
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:42,004
Stop!

565
00:46:03,683 --> 00:46:04,771
Try catching me!

566
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,191
- Stop! You rascal
- Please don't hit me

567
00:46:14,588 --> 00:46:16,221
Don't hit hard. We have orders

568
00:46:24,692 --> 00:46:25,689
Let's go

569
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:29,103
Let me call Aryan Khanna

570
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:30,865
Where are you taking me?

571
00:46:37,686 --> 00:46:39,686
Sid Kapoor is evil. Don't get
mixed up with him

572
00:46:39,978 --> 00:46:40,908
Shut up!

573
00:46:41,171 --> 00:46:44,769
I did it for Aryan Khanna.
His problem is my problem

574
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:51,686
If Aryan hears about this...

575
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:53,666
...he'll skin you alive

576
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,228
Stop!

577
00:46:58,144 --> 00:47:01,853
Think carefully. We'll be back.
Let's go

578
00:47:29,686 --> 00:47:31,269
Good evening, sir. Come in

579
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:48,894
We asked him why he made the video

580
00:47:49,752 --> 00:47:51,561
He says he'll talk only to you

581
00:47:52,028 --> 00:47:54,792
You told us to go easy on him

582
00:47:55,475 --> 00:47:57,478
- Hardly touched him
- Thank you

583
00:47:58,223 --> 00:47:59,936
- Usman
- Yes, sir?

584
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:03,658
This is for his expenses

585
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,415
Keep him here for 2 days

586
00:48:05,678 --> 00:48:07,968
Get him a ticket to Delhi.
Take him to the station

587
00:48:08,224 --> 00:48:10,936
As I said, don't beat him up
too badly

588
00:48:11,678 --> 00:48:12,714
Just enough to scare him

589
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,228
No one must hear about this

590
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:19,801
No police record, no video statement.
Please

591
00:48:20,134 --> 00:48:21,311
Sure, sir

592
00:48:21,861 --> 00:48:23,394
Where is he?

593
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:26,974
I want to meet him alone

594
00:48:28,386 --> 00:48:29,813
- You stay here
- Yeah

595
00:48:43,135 --> 00:48:43,976
Gaurav

596
00:49:06,336 --> 00:49:07,257
Senior

597
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:08,819
You're here

598
00:49:10,486 --> 00:49:12,336
I knew you'd come

599
00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:15,628
They hit me and hit me

600
00:49:16,044 --> 00:49:18,128
They broke my bones

601
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,959
I protected my face

602
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,628
It's Aryan Khanna's face.
Nothing must happen to it

603
00:49:33,586 --> 00:49:36,292
See? Same to same

604
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:41,419
Everyone calls me Junior
Aryan Khanna. But I say...

605
00:49:41,904 --> 00:49:43,058
...there's only one Aryan Khanna

606
00:49:45,755 --> 00:49:46,777
Relax

607
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:49,836
It's ok

608
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:58,436
I impersonate you at the yearly
Super Star competition

609
00:50:00,274 --> 00:50:01,331
Always win first prize

610
00:50:04,775 --> 00:50:07,172
The bastards took my bag.
My trophy was in it

611
00:50:07,827 --> 00:50:09,076
I brought it to show you

612
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,294
I could show you my act

613
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:28,836
I'm nervous in front of you

614
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,347
It's all right. Sit

615
00:50:31,924 --> 00:50:36,169
No audience here. Their screaming
and cheering helps

616
00:50:36,544 --> 00:50:38,253
- Are you from Delhi?
- West Delhi

617
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:40,419
You're from Rajender Nagar,
I'm from Inder Vihar

618
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,864
Two traffic lights from the TV tower.
Near DAV Park

619
00:50:43,495 --> 00:50:44,919
Listen carefully

620
00:50:45,952 --> 00:50:48,523
You did something nasty

621
00:50:50,073 --> 00:50:51,058
It's a crime

622
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:55,937
A crime in the eyes of the law.
Love in your eyes, no?

623
00:50:56,322 --> 00:50:58,741
Not love, it's stupidity

624
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:02,794
Do you have family?

625
00:51:03,248 --> 00:51:05,253
There's Papa, Mummy

626
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,294
And you, too

627
00:51:07,886 --> 00:51:09,507
Have you thought what
your parents would say?

628
00:51:09,827 --> 00:51:12,419
They'd be sad seeing you
in that sadistic video

629
00:51:12,919 --> 00:51:15,919
Why would we show it to them?
It was for you

630
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:18,003
Did you like my birthday gift?

631
00:51:18,717 --> 00:51:21,669
Sid Kapoor? I beat the crap
out of him

632
00:51:24,393 --> 00:51:28,245
I don't understand how the cops
discovered our little secret

633
00:51:29,729 --> 00:51:30,628
Our?

634
00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:36,294
There is no our between
you and me

635
00:51:37,101 --> 00:51:39,267
The police brought you here
on my orders

636
00:51:40,543 --> 00:51:42,581
You made a mistake. You
had to be punished

637
00:51:42,951 --> 00:51:45,165
So you won't mess up again

638
00:51:48,502 --> 00:51:51,956
On your orders? I did so much for you

639
00:51:55,638 --> 00:51:57,656
Who are you to do anything
for me?

640
00:52:01,087 --> 00:52:02,248
I'm your fan

641
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,540
- You're my star
- Fan? So you do as you please?

642
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,781
Thrash people? Murder?

643
00:52:11,081 --> 00:52:14,544
If need be, I could murder for you

644
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,862
You're not my fan

645
00:52:22,078 --> 00:52:23,373
Don't say that

646
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:26,165
I risked my life to meet you

647
00:52:26,998 --> 00:52:30,200
I hit Sid Kapoor a little, so you'd
meet me. What did I want...

648
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:32,040
...in return?

649
00:52:33,206 --> 00:52:36,498
To see you, a few photos,
an autograph. That's all

650
00:52:38,684 --> 00:52:41,934
- Can't you spare 5 min of your life?
- It's my life

651
00:52:43,256 --> 00:52:45,915
Why must I give you even
five seconds?

652
00:53:11,743 --> 00:53:14,971
I am who I am today,
where I am today

653
00:53:16,784 --> 00:53:17,748
My stardom

654
00:53:19,873 --> 00:53:22,206
It's all thanks to my fans

655
00:53:25,337 --> 00:53:26,956
If it weren't for my fans...

656
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,456
I'd be nothing

657
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:45,831
Gaurav makes Aryan

658
00:53:47,998 --> 00:53:49,165
Without Gaurav...

659
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:51,748
...Aryan is nothing

660
00:53:55,568 --> 00:53:57,165
Now you listen carefully

661
00:53:57,798 --> 00:54:01,123
When the police let you go,
go straight to Delhi, get it?

662
00:54:01,967 --> 00:54:03,303
I'll forget all about Gaurav

663
00:54:03,596 --> 00:54:06,203
And you forget you ever met Aryan

664
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:10,748
Stay in your life.
I stay in mine

665
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:15,529
This is your final warning. Ok

666
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:30,457
Forget it

667
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:32,717
You won't understand

668
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:47,448
Yes, Mummy

669
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:48,907
I'll be home soon

670
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:49,639
Everything ok?

671
00:55:49,874 --> 00:55:50,739
Everything is fine

672
00:55:50,997 --> 00:55:52,013
Why didn't you take my call?

673
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:53,544
I was busy

674
00:55:53,845 --> 00:55:55,143
Gaurav, we're worried about you

675
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:56,226
Don't worry

676
00:55:56,446 --> 00:55:57,823
You'll come home soon?

677
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,750
Tell Papa to mind the Cyber Cafe

678
00:56:00,034 --> 00:56:00,946
Are you eating properly?

679
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:02,989
The food is fine here

680
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:07,281
Thank you

681
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,265
Come, hero. Sir wants you

682
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:17,406
Whatever happened has happened.
Put it behind you. Right?

683
00:57:17,879 --> 00:57:20,561
Thank you, brother. I made
a mistake. Sorry

684
00:57:52,055 --> 00:57:52,833
Gaurav!

685
00:57:55,734 --> 00:57:57,872
Did you hug Aryan Khanna?

686
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:14,181
Didn't he meet you?
Didn't spare 5 minutes?

687
00:58:14,554 --> 00:58:16,264
Don't you feel bad

688
00:58:16,589 --> 00:58:19,348
It's not my loss. It's his

689
00:58:20,181 --> 00:58:23,306
He's happy where he is.
I'm happy where I am

690
00:58:26,726 --> 00:58:28,723
Mummy, make me some
rice and beans tonight

691
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:00,212
Hello, aunty

692
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:02,056
You're moving out?

693
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,783
Who knows what this boy wants

694
00:59:05,031 --> 00:59:06,806
Got a good price?

695
00:59:07,354 --> 00:59:09,931
Don't worry, Papa. I'll invest wisely

696
00:59:10,411 --> 00:59:12,639
Too much time wasted on Aryan

697
00:59:14,058 --> 00:59:15,514
The shop is sold, Mummy.
Let's go

698
00:59:15,963 --> 00:59:17,556
Hurry. You coming?

699
00:59:18,029 --> 00:59:19,369
- Let's go
- Ok, come

700
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:21,718
All well, aunty?

701
01:00:57,509 --> 01:00:59,884
Fans chase stars

702
01:01:01,176 --> 01:01:03,360
Now a star will chase a fan

703
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:08,183
Whenever Aryan Khanna's name
is taken...

704
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:12,524
...it'll be in the same breath
as Gaurav Chandna

705
01:01:39,549 --> 01:01:41,084
1 Year later

706
01:01:41,488 --> 01:01:44,359
Welcome to Bollywood Caf.
98.1 FM

707
01:01:44,822 --> 01:01:46,519
Do you know what's special
about the weekend?

708
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,975
Guys, this weekend...

709
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,758
...is the Aryan Khanna reloaded
show presented by Hyundai

710
01:01:51,402 --> 01:01:53,968
Stars have a great life

711
01:01:54,301 --> 01:01:56,318
I want a life like Aryan's

712
01:01:56,555 --> 01:01:57,591
Full on, jet setter!

713
01:01:57,817 --> 01:02:00,008
One day in London, Dubrovnik the next

714
01:02:00,226 --> 01:02:02,037
For the grand Bhutiani wedding

715
01:02:02,255 --> 01:02:03,854
Then back to the London show

716
01:02:04,045 --> 01:02:04,754
Wow!

717
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:08,087
Do you know London is
one of his favourite places?

718
01:02:08,293 --> 01:02:10,980
In fact he considers it his
second home after Mumbai

719
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:15,890
We have some good news
and some bad news

720
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:17,591
The bad news first, obviously

721
01:02:17,909 --> 01:02:20,565
The Hyundai Aryan Khanna reloaded
show is houseful

722
01:02:20,859 --> 01:02:22,716
Oh no! What's the good news?

723
01:02:22,984 --> 01:02:25,906
We have 20 free tickets
for our listeners

724
01:02:26,771 --> 01:02:29,940
Who ever is the first to answer
my question correctly...

725
01:02:30,188 --> 01:02:32,295
...wins a free show ticket

726
01:02:32,538 --> 01:02:36,830
My question follows straight after
this beautiful song

727
01:02:48,554 --> 01:02:50,261
Here's your tickets. Enjoy your visit

728
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:54,550
- How can I help you?
- One ticket please

729
01:02:57,547 --> 01:02:58,485
Enjoy your visit

730
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,544
The real drama starts now

731
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:55,669
Aryan Khanna!

732
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:10,083
Mr. Khanna, Tim Baker,
the Manager

733
01:04:10,706 --> 01:04:11,960
Aryan Khanna, the actor

734
01:04:13,877 --> 01:04:15,210
I hope it's not a bother

735
01:04:15,847 --> 01:04:17,377
Fans never bother

736
01:04:22,752 --> 01:04:24,669
Sir, a photo with your wax figure

737
01:04:26,205 --> 01:04:28,752
Let me say this. It's amazing

738
01:04:29,113 --> 01:04:31,169
You've come all the way to London...

739
01:04:31,585 --> 01:04:33,252
...to take a photo with
my wax figure

740
01:04:33,852 --> 01:04:36,881
Really, that's very sweet.
Is this better?

741
01:04:38,845 --> 01:04:39,544
Better now?

742
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:43,267
Let me warn you

743
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:44,859
I was much younger then

744
01:04:46,072 --> 01:04:47,351
You like it?

745
01:04:47,556 --> 01:04:48,294
Honestly...

746
01:04:49,046 --> 01:04:49,960
...it's very scary

747
01:04:51,731 --> 01:04:53,497
So, does he look like me?

748
01:04:53,762 --> 01:04:56,399
- You look great in real life
- Exactly, darling

749
01:04:56,705 --> 01:04:59,794
I agree. What a fat nose he has

750
01:05:00,484 --> 01:05:02,377
My nose is tiny

751
01:05:03,698 --> 01:05:05,252
A phony face

752
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,020
A fake smile

753
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,485
All phony

754
01:05:09,308 --> 01:05:10,840
I don't smile like this

755
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,502
Actually no one smiles like this

756
01:05:16,211 --> 01:05:19,127
His hair smells bad.
Feels bad, looks bad

757
01:05:22,271 --> 01:05:25,022
In fact, I don't look like him at all

758
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:27,316
This is a fake

759
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,291
Aryan Khanna is a fake

760
01:05:30,729 --> 01:05:34,252
I want a refund. Aryan Khanna
is a fake

761
01:05:36,716 --> 01:05:39,002
This isn't right. You can't do this
to our property

762
01:05:39,925 --> 01:05:42,310
The white man claims
my face is his property

763
01:05:43,325 --> 01:05:45,818
Mr. Property Agent. This is me

764
01:05:46,287 --> 01:05:47,836
My face, my property

765
01:05:48,383 --> 01:05:51,064
- Stop now and leave, sir
- I won't leave

766
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:57,210
It's a joke. You guys can't
take a joke

767
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:04,674
Come here. Come

768
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,900
Who can stop me?

769
01:06:07,372 --> 01:06:08,729
I'll shoot you all

770
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,062
I don't understand what
you're talking about

771
01:06:12,585 --> 01:06:13,720
You are gonna be in a lot
of trouble over this

772
01:06:13,991 --> 01:06:14,405
Really?

773
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:19,044
You are in trouble too

774
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:22,659
Stay out of my way! I'll shoot

775
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:31,712
You alright?

776
01:07:19,722 --> 01:07:20,876
Aryan...

777
01:07:24,454 --> 01:07:25,025
What?

778
01:07:25,464 --> 01:07:26,136
Come out

779
01:07:26,593 --> 01:07:27,567
What are you saying?

780
01:07:32,156 --> 01:07:33,486
Arrest warrant for you

781
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,927
What the hell is this?

782
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,060
I didn't go to Madame Tussauds

783
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,791
- The Indian Ambassador on line
- I'm not talking to any Ambassador

784
01:07:43,427 --> 01:07:44,504
I'm here to arrest him

785
01:07:45,093 --> 01:07:46,968
Sir, Mr. Khanna did not go to
Madame Tussauds...

786
01:07:47,177 --> 01:07:49,010
Are you Mr. Khanna?

787
01:07:49,385 --> 01:07:51,260
Then just shut up and let me
do my job

788
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:54,536
Excuse me. So you are doing
your job and we are faffing?

789
01:07:55,218 --> 01:07:58,260
Must say you have a very polite way
of talking to women, Mr. Duncan

790
01:07:58,862 --> 01:07:59,511
Guess what?

791
01:07:59,718 --> 01:08:01,760
It's my turn to be polite now

792
01:08:02,502 --> 01:08:04,274
This, sir, is nonsense

793
01:08:06,365 --> 01:08:08,925
Where were you between
10 and 10.30 this morning?

794
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:10,654
- I was at home
- And who were you with?

795
01:08:11,802 --> 01:08:12,510
I was alone

796
01:08:12,802 --> 01:08:14,723
Did anyone see you at home?

797
01:08:15,885 --> 01:08:17,135
I just told you I was alone

798
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:18,688
Aryan, I'll call our lawyer

799
01:08:19,312 --> 01:08:22,099
Can you talk in a language
we all can understand?

800
01:08:22,622 --> 01:08:24,911
Let me translate it in a language
you understand

801
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:26,616
Lawyer

802
01:08:27,385 --> 01:08:28,510
Two options

803
01:08:29,085 --> 01:08:32,257
Handcuffs if you are nasty,
without handcuffs if you are nice

804
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:40,242
Nasty

805
01:09:16,505 --> 01:09:18,035
Just five minutes

806
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:19,218
You stay here

807
01:09:19,507 --> 01:09:20,802
Just five minutes sir, please

808
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,753
Let's call Akhtar

809
01:09:44,887 --> 01:09:45,406
What happened?

810
01:09:46,639 --> 01:09:47,604
Lost your funny bone?

811
01:09:49,804 --> 01:09:50,487
That's not me

812
01:09:52,241 --> 01:09:53,302
Behaves like you

813
01:09:54,637 --> 01:09:55,811
Looks like you

814
01:09:57,137 --> 01:09:59,680
Everybody calls this person
by your name

815
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,439
I said that's not me

816
01:10:05,526 --> 01:10:06,463
You have any proof?

817
01:10:09,695 --> 01:10:11,961
Say something, Mr. Superstar

818
01:10:14,304 --> 01:10:16,137
Not to you, Mr. Small-Time cop

819
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:18,335
Not a word without my lawyer

820
01:10:19,429 --> 01:10:20,282
Suit yourself

821
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,549
24 hrs remand for Mr. Khanna

822
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:25,616
Till he comes out with the truth

823
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:28,879
- You can't do that
- Sure, I can

824
01:10:37,078 --> 01:10:39,139
Sir, one photograph please?

825
01:10:45,903 --> 01:10:48,159
- You have a safe trip, sir
- Yeah, I will be

826
01:11:56,476 --> 01:11:57,720
It's time. Lets go

827
01:12:10,289 --> 01:12:13,091
DUBROVNIK

828
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:22,088
In Croatian, we say - How are you?

829
01:12:24,236 --> 01:12:25,183
I'm fine

830
01:12:26,084 --> 01:12:27,220
My name is Gaurav

831
01:12:32,216 --> 01:12:33,687
Thank you

832
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:41,408
Vegetable sandwich... one

833
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:42,832
Which one do you want?

834
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:44,094
This one?

835
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,854
Ok. Here we go

836
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:52,539
No, no, more. Six more

837
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:56,143
It's ok. Here

838
01:12:58,750 --> 01:12:59,712
Thank you

839
01:13:02,697 --> 01:13:03,532
Thanks

840
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:35,181
It's only bail

841
01:13:36,631 --> 01:13:37,945
We know you're lying

842
01:13:38,343 --> 01:13:40,220
Why would I waste my lies on you?

843
01:13:41,249 --> 01:13:44,096
That was no imposter.
You twisted psycho

844
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:46,112
We'll have you back
in jail in no time

845
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:47,695
Please do that

846
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:50,472
Maybe I'll earn some money suing you
and the entire British police

847
01:13:50,915 --> 01:13:53,656
Aryan, control your temper

848
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:56,195
It's their city, their country

849
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,029
Don't make matters worse
for yourself

850
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:03,083
So we're done with all
the formalities?

851
01:14:03,862 --> 01:14:04,695
Thanks a lot

852
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:07,237
Pathetic fool

853
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:11,690
I'm coming with you to Dubrovnik
in case of any immigration problem

854
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:13,737
Hey! Not that way

855
01:14:14,775 --> 01:14:16,112
The press is outside

856
01:14:19,177 --> 01:14:21,339
Aryan, this is Deputy High
Commissioner, Mr. Murthy

857
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:23,279
Pleased to meet you

858
01:14:23,612 --> 01:14:25,445
Sorry you had to go through
all this but...

859
01:14:25,657 --> 01:14:27,504
We can't interfere very much

860
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:29,195
This is a foreign country after all

861
01:14:29,584 --> 01:14:32,362
I know. Rules in every country
are made to get the innocent

862
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,487
Sir, we're diplomats, not detectives

863
01:14:35,996 --> 01:14:39,362
Before the case is solved, we have
permission for you to travel

864
01:14:39,695 --> 01:14:41,410
Now we can only do that much

865
01:14:41,606 --> 01:14:43,979
It's a serious matter.
A diplomatic issue

866
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:47,570
So you must prove it wasn't you
at Madame Tussauds

867
01:14:47,975 --> 01:14:50,863
Must I prove it? Ok, I'll play cop

868
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:53,862
I really appreciate your help

869
01:14:54,529 --> 01:14:55,303
Thank you

870
01:14:55,896 --> 01:14:57,320
Thank you, sir

871
01:15:00,033 --> 01:15:02,038
In jail or dancing at a wedding...

872
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,344
...these stars are so arrogant

873
01:15:06,987 --> 01:15:10,162
Your home CCTV footage has saved us.
It's with the police

874
01:15:10,379 --> 01:15:14,362
It proves an impostor was at Madame
Tussauds and you were at home

875
01:15:15,201 --> 01:15:17,679
Who is he? What's his motive

876
01:15:17,949 --> 01:15:19,187
Forget the London cops

877
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,195
Find out. We need to get this guy

878
01:15:22,446 --> 01:15:24,600
We'll know more back in London

879
01:15:25,216 --> 01:15:26,622
So you know you can
really relax now

880
01:15:26,832 --> 01:15:28,484
Wine? Champagne? Anything?

881
01:15:29,145 --> 01:15:29,633
Everything

882
01:15:29,813 --> 01:15:31,482
Come on, Aryan. It's over now

883
01:15:31,856 --> 01:15:33,673
Sir, a call

884
01:15:33,921 --> 01:15:37,052
He says he knows the imposter
at Madame Tussauds

885
01:15:37,727 --> 01:15:40,404
- Give me the phone. I'll talk
- He'll only talk to sir

886
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,945
He won't give me his name

887
01:15:43,269 --> 01:15:44,253
Give it to me

888
01:15:50,222 --> 01:15:51,033
Hello

889
01:15:58,588 --> 01:15:59,362
Senior

890
01:16:05,175 --> 01:16:05,925
Chandna?

891
01:16:07,092 --> 01:16:08,967
I won't let you forget my name

892
01:16:09,493 --> 01:16:11,425
It'll be taken in the same breath
as your name

893
01:16:12,425 --> 01:16:13,217
What do you want?

894
01:16:13,482 --> 01:16:14,759
The stage is set

895
01:16:15,259 --> 01:16:18,384
Tell everyone - admit what you did
was wrong

896
01:16:19,219 --> 01:16:22,030
You'll never break a fan's heart
again. Say sorry

897
01:16:22,403 --> 01:16:25,050
Stop this nonsense! I'm not
apologising to anyone

898
01:16:25,947 --> 01:16:28,105
I tried to make you see sense

899
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,917
If you had agreed to give me
5 minutes

900
01:16:31,698 --> 01:16:33,425
I would have my life.
You would have yours

901
01:16:33,896 --> 01:16:36,342
But you had to prove you had
star power

902
01:16:36,672 --> 01:16:37,950
Now you'll see a fan's power

903
01:16:38,174 --> 01:16:39,092
I'm a star

904
01:16:39,863 --> 01:16:42,800
I took your pranks as childishness.
Threw you inside for only 2 days

905
01:16:43,846 --> 01:16:46,175
If I knew the real you,
you'd still be inside

906
01:16:46,513 --> 01:16:49,732
In 48 hours you snatched away
my devotion of 25 years

907
01:16:50,826 --> 01:16:52,509
If you don't say sorry...

908
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:55,073
...in the next 48 hours,
your stardom is over

909
01:16:56,023 --> 01:16:57,175
Do what you want

910
01:16:58,498 --> 01:17:00,420
I've seen off dozens like you

911
01:17:00,835 --> 01:17:04,009
The higher you fly, the harder
I'll make you fall

912
01:17:06,058 --> 01:17:09,008
But you must fly as high as me,
Gaurav Chandna

913
01:17:09,231 --> 01:17:10,991
Impossible for you

914
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,187
We'll see how far you get
impersonating me

915
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:19,070
I don't need to go far

916
01:17:19,754 --> 01:17:22,493
You're getting closer to me.
In Dubrovnik

917
01:17:26,624 --> 01:17:28,862
Idiot. He's in Dubrovnik

918
01:17:33,422 --> 01:17:35,465
Unknown caller, unknown location

919
01:17:35,975 --> 01:17:39,467
Obviously, Sunaina. He won't
call from a traceable number

920
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,092
Say sorry. It's no big deal

921
01:17:48,278 --> 01:17:49,377
He's mad

922
01:17:49,605 --> 01:17:52,267
Is that so? And what am I?

923
01:17:56,849 --> 01:17:57,922
Is the make-up team in place?

924
01:17:58,141 --> 01:17:59,851
They are on there way

925
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:03,163
Oh great. The props, fireworks,
confetti all that

926
01:18:03,516 --> 01:18:05,597
We've done a couple of rehearsals.
Everything's perfect

927
01:18:05,792 --> 01:18:06,971
Ok. Thank you

928
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,164
Aryan asked for a background
check of all the staff members

929
01:18:10,404 --> 01:18:12,033
- Is it done yet?
- It's going on right now

930
01:18:12,251 --> 01:18:13,220
Ok. Thank you

931
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:18,507
Nicksi Jelopera

932
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,568
- Medium?
- Medium size

933
01:19:19,158 --> 01:19:22,094
You're so late, Aryan Khanna.
It's just not done

934
01:19:22,419 --> 01:19:24,839
I apologise. I'm extremely sorry,
Mr. Bhutiani

935
01:19:25,038 --> 01:19:26,437
I had a crisis, I'm sorry

936
01:19:26,672 --> 01:19:29,566
You celebrities always have
some crisis

937
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:32,066
But my daughter doesn't
get married everyday

938
01:19:32,258 --> 01:19:34,205
- I know. I'm sorry
- You've no idea

939
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:38,326
That stunt you pulled in London has
caused me great loss of face

940
01:19:38,581 --> 01:19:39,714
No, Mr. Bhutiani

941
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:42,200
What happened at Madame Tussauds...

942
01:19:43,554 --> 01:19:45,434
You know what? I'll make
it up to you

943
01:19:45,674 --> 01:19:49,155
I swear. Your guests will always think
of the grand Bhutiani wedding

944
01:19:49,389 --> 01:19:50,628
They better do

945
01:19:51,043 --> 01:19:52,748
After all I'm spending
a bomb on you

946
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:58,321
Only you can. I'll get ready

947
01:20:00,024 --> 01:20:02,461
Sunaina, find out where
the CCTV cameras are

948
01:20:02,721 --> 01:20:06,030
Usman, watch the guest areas,
the bars, the toilets, the corridors

949
01:20:06,478 --> 01:20:08,530
- Keep an eye on everyone
- Excuse me, sir

950
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:11,299
I'm really sorry to interrupt but
we just have 2 minutes

951
01:20:11,962 --> 01:20:14,149
I don't need two, darling.
Let's go, I'm ready

952
01:20:14,999 --> 01:20:15,927
Good luck

953
01:20:16,705 --> 01:20:17,807
Payal, tell me the names

954
01:20:18,037 --> 01:20:20,339
Is Bhutiani's son-in-law called
Amul Mirchandani?

955
01:20:20,517 --> 01:20:21,823
It's Anmol Mirchandani

956
01:20:21,996 --> 01:20:23,919
Guys, all the best. Break
a leg and do well

957
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:26,190
And sisters Anushka, Deepshika?

958
01:20:26,475 --> 01:20:28,715
That's for later, it's all here

959
01:20:29,936 --> 01:20:31,844
Second entry dance 5,6,7,8.
You're giving it to me

960
01:20:32,055 --> 01:20:33,699
- Sir, your shades
- Thank you, Payal

961
01:20:33,881 --> 01:20:35,823
Ok guys. You have 30 seconds
to go

962
01:20:36,056 --> 01:20:37,595
All the best, just kill it

963
01:21:22,692 --> 01:21:24,240
Check all entries and exits

964
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:25,701
Ok, Sunaina

965
01:21:38,636 --> 01:21:39,572
Find anything?

966
01:21:39,749 --> 01:21:43,549
Not yet, sir. I've spoken to the team,
no one enters without an invite

967
01:21:43,747 --> 01:21:45,285
Sir, your cue cards

968
01:21:45,573 --> 01:21:46,883
15 secs to go

969
01:21:48,322 --> 01:21:49,023
Can you go to cam 4

970
01:21:53,383 --> 01:21:55,591
When you count the night stars...

971
01:21:55,883 --> 01:21:57,943
...and yearn to etch her name
on every star

972
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,966
You know you're in love

973
01:22:00,258 --> 01:22:02,440
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead

974
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:06,721
When you look for her in a crowd,
you know you're in love

975
01:22:09,694 --> 01:22:11,190
Say sorry

976
01:22:14,308 --> 01:22:15,649
Check the crew's photos

977
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:18,542
He's not a guest. He's crew.
Quick

978
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,518
Got it

979
01:22:23,758 --> 01:22:24,549
Sorry

980
01:22:37,951 --> 01:22:38,591
There. Zoom in

981
01:22:39,766 --> 01:22:42,110
Check the crew backstage

982
01:22:42,768 --> 01:22:43,196
Copy

983
01:22:43,537 --> 01:22:46,841
Payal, we need the crew ids.
Photographs and bio-datas

984
01:22:47,315 --> 01:22:49,934
- Anything serious, sir?
- Aryan wants to know

985
01:23:03,286 --> 01:23:04,113
Sorry

986
01:23:04,361 --> 01:23:05,022
It's fine

987
01:23:08,398 --> 01:23:10,053
The crew is local

988
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,192
Except one guy. Half Indian,
half Croatian

989
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:17,901
Akhtar is sending you a photo
of him

990
01:23:18,406 --> 01:23:19,526
Keep a close eye

991
01:23:25,098 --> 01:23:25,924
Round up all the crew

992
01:23:56,243 --> 01:23:58,241
- Any sign of him?
- Sir, nothing

993
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,991
He's not responding

994
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:01,033
Sunaina

995
01:24:01,324 --> 01:24:02,824
Can't see him on any camera

996
01:24:03,241 --> 01:24:04,775
- But I'm at it
- What are you at it?

997
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,176
Where is there no CCTV camera?

998
01:24:14,131 --> 01:24:15,331
Your make-up room

999
01:24:24,449 --> 01:24:25,326
Careful, sir

1000
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:46,366
Gaurav makes Aryan

1001
01:24:57,579 --> 01:25:00,074
You're very stubborn.
You don't listen to me

1002
01:25:00,743 --> 01:25:03,699
Why are you hiding?
Talk face-to-face

1003
01:25:04,456 --> 01:25:06,579
I stand face-to-face, Aryan Khanna

1004
01:25:07,543 --> 01:25:09,408
But you never see me

1005
01:25:10,127 --> 01:25:13,908
Now when I'm not there, you're
longing to see me

1006
01:25:15,563 --> 01:25:17,491
I know the feeling

1007
01:25:18,027 --> 01:25:20,249
I felt it among the crowd
in front of your house

1008
01:25:26,186 --> 01:25:29,699
Sir, the Bhutianis are waiting.
The audience interaction...

1009
01:25:30,553 --> 01:25:33,227
Yeah. I'm coming

1010
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:35,908
- I'll take care of it
- Thank you

1011
01:25:38,531 --> 01:25:40,628
I'll come back and see you.
Hi sweetheart

1012
01:25:41,054 --> 01:25:42,283
Hope you enjoyed the show

1013
01:25:42,682 --> 01:25:44,701
- Aryan, it was marvelous
- Thank you

1014
01:25:45,133 --> 01:25:46,263
That's my daughter

1015
01:25:46,499 --> 01:25:49,699
She's been practicing a step to
dance with you for two months

1016
01:25:50,165 --> 01:25:51,934
Actually we were both practicing

1017
01:25:52,165 --> 01:25:53,540
How pretty is she

1018
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,557
You know what? Let me start
with the young one

1019
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:57,528
...and I'll come back
for the experience

1020
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:23,109
We've found Chandna

1021
01:26:23,415 --> 01:26:26,540
In the corridor, across from where
you're dancing

1022
01:26:27,246 --> 01:26:28,415
I'm not dancing

1023
01:26:29,396 --> 01:26:30,673
Chandna is on the dance floor

1024
01:27:20,737 --> 01:27:22,331
What the hell is wrong with him?

1025
01:27:22,864 --> 01:27:26,331
I was dancing. He started touching me
here, there, everywhere

1026
01:27:27,016 --> 01:27:28,540
I don't know. You'll have
to do something

1027
01:27:28,806 --> 01:27:30,770
- Get him out
- I don't care

1028
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:43,290
What the hell are you doing?

1029
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:44,331
Mr. Bhutiani?

1030
01:27:44,613 --> 01:27:46,655
- Where do you think you are?
- Calm down, Mr. Bhutiani

1031
01:27:46,831 --> 01:27:49,053
- What happened?
- That girl is like my daughter

1032
01:27:50,877 --> 01:27:52,623
Is this how you film stars behave?

1033
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:55,190
I'm really sorry, ladies.
I'm sorry

1034
01:27:55,389 --> 01:27:58,206
I'll explain. The guy who was
here wasn't me

1035
01:27:58,759 --> 01:28:00,435
- Nonsense
- It was somebody else

1036
01:28:00,615 --> 01:28:01,873
I'm Aryan Khanna

1037
01:28:02,597 --> 01:28:04,040
- I'm Aryan Khanna
- What nonsense!

1038
01:28:04,206 --> 01:28:05,716
You known me for years

1039
01:28:05,889 --> 01:28:08,693
I love you guys. I'd never
harm you people

1040
01:28:08,966 --> 01:28:10,777
That person wasn't me

1041
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:14,165
I suggest you leave

1042
01:28:27,915 --> 01:28:29,170
Keep back!

1043
01:28:40,123 --> 01:28:40,841
Stop the car!

1044
01:34:02,653 --> 01:34:04,948
No one has given me the
interaction script

1045
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:09,285
15 minutes to show time.
Is there a delay?

1046
01:34:13,822 --> 01:34:14,681
What?

1047
01:34:21,517 --> 01:34:23,014
The show's cancelled

1048
01:34:24,286 --> 01:34:28,281
They've boycotted the show

1049
01:34:29,783 --> 01:34:32,236
Sponsors have also pulled out

1050
01:34:34,768 --> 01:34:37,375
Nobody came, not a soul

1051
01:35:48,718 --> 01:35:49,701
Whats wrong with you?

1052
01:35:49,893 --> 01:35:50,508
You wimp

1053
01:35:50,657 --> 01:35:51,867
Watch where you're going?

1054
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:06,765
Media playing up the story

1055
01:36:07,366 --> 01:36:08,703
The wedding video has gone viral

1056
01:36:25,524 --> 01:36:29,225
Given Khanna's status, he must
take responsibility for his actions

1057
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,069
Is he attention-seeking?

1058
01:36:31,298 --> 01:36:33,695
Movie stars forget that one day
they'll be has-beens

1059
01:36:33,905 --> 01:36:36,710
Stars must go through traumas.
Look at what his done

1060
01:36:37,003 --> 01:36:39,023
It's a crime if an ordinary man
misbehaves...

1061
01:36:39,251 --> 01:36:42,015
...if it's a star - it's a stunt.
Why these double standards...

1062
01:36:42,273 --> 01:36:44,898
...for stars? A criminal is
a criminal

1063
01:36:54,482 --> 01:36:55,052
Hello

1064
01:36:55,623 --> 01:36:58,087
Hello, sir. It's me, Aryan.
I'm calling from London

1065
01:36:58,861 --> 01:37:01,312
I know you are in London,
but what's going on?

1066
01:37:03,049 --> 01:37:05,969
A Delhi boy is impersonating me,
committing crimes

1067
01:37:06,426 --> 01:37:07,611
We have to arrest him

1068
01:37:07,879 --> 01:37:11,014
But the crimes are committed
outside of India

1069
01:37:11,591 --> 01:37:14,510
We can't arrest him. It's not
in our jurisdiction

1070
01:37:14,853 --> 01:37:17,255
Must we wait till he commits
a crime in India?

1071
01:37:18,313 --> 01:37:19,635
His name is Gaurav Chandna

1072
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:22,398
Find me his Delhi address.
It will help

1073
01:37:23,353 --> 01:37:25,130
You don't teach me my job

1074
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:28,897
But who shall we arrest?
You're the accused, Aryan

1075
01:37:29,715 --> 01:37:31,295
I just...

1076
01:37:31,733 --> 01:37:33,577
Come back to India

1077
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,227
Then we'll look into the matter with
the proper procedure. OK?

1078
01:37:39,699 --> 01:37:40,546
Hello

1079
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:45,093
What did he say?

1080
01:37:48,241 --> 01:37:50,218
Organise a press conference
first thing tomorrow

1081
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,361
- In Mumbai?
- No, here in London

1082
01:37:56,755 --> 01:38:02,253
You now have the video footage
and all the documents, etc

1083
01:38:03,106 --> 01:38:04,718
You have proof...

1084
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:09,101
...that Aryan Khanna did not
commit these crimes

1085
01:38:18,653 --> 01:38:22,221
You're angry with me, and you
have the right to be

1086
01:38:23,412 --> 01:38:24,427
But believe me

1087
01:38:25,238 --> 01:38:28,068
That dangerous and evil face
you see on TV is not me

1088
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:30,052
That person is not me

1089
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:31,343
So please give me time

1090
01:38:31,613 --> 01:38:35,247
Time, so that I can prove
I've done nothing wrong

1091
01:38:37,151 --> 01:38:40,112
I'd never do anything that
would make you ashamed...

1092
01:38:40,394 --> 01:38:41,854
...to call me your star

1093
01:38:42,611 --> 01:38:44,044
Whatever I am...

1094
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:52,135
I just want to say, I would
never do anything like this

1095
01:38:53,142 --> 01:38:53,893
Thank you

1096
01:38:56,146 --> 01:39:00,153
Sir, do you know this impostor?
Have you met him?

1097
01:39:00,580 --> 01:39:04,514
Sorry. We can't talk now.
The case is under trial

1098
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:06,184
What about the imposter's name?

1099
01:39:06,424 --> 01:39:09,291
As soon as we have proof,
you'll be the first to know

1100
01:39:10,018 --> 01:39:12,505
Are you the real Aryan Khanna
or the imposter?

1101
01:39:16,518 --> 01:39:18,459
You find this funny? A big joke?

1102
01:39:20,213 --> 01:39:23,957
If this happened to a girl in your
family would you still be grinning?

1103
01:39:25,849 --> 01:39:29,232
A woman was molested and
you find it's funny?

1104
01:39:30,704 --> 01:39:31,864
And one more thing

1105
01:39:32,933 --> 01:39:35,691
This press meet is not
to prove my innocence

1106
01:39:36,556 --> 01:39:38,292
I want to warn you all

1107
01:39:39,494 --> 01:39:42,587
The man who's impersonating me,
spoiling my name

1108
01:39:43,104 --> 01:39:45,699
He can hurt anyone, anytime

1109
01:39:46,492 --> 01:39:47,684
So please be careful

1110
01:39:49,687 --> 01:39:51,183
Thank you everybody.
Thanks for coming

1111
01:39:51,429 --> 01:39:53,814
Aryan has a flight to catch, he's
going back to India

1112
01:39:54,132 --> 01:39:55,615
So have a great day and
see you soon

1113
01:39:56,258 --> 01:39:58,384
MUMBAI

1114
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:12,865
Don't stop, go from behind

1115
01:40:23,164 --> 01:40:23,963
Open up!

1116
01:40:26,164 --> 01:40:28,889
One minute, sir. Madam said we must
inform her

1117
01:40:29,528 --> 01:40:30,764
Good. Hurry up

1118
01:40:31,081 --> 01:40:32,897
Before the journalists outside mob me

1119
01:40:38,569 --> 01:40:39,064
Hello

1120
01:40:39,281 --> 01:40:41,140
Ma'am, can sir come in?

1121
01:40:44,604 --> 01:40:45,709
No, wait a second

1122
01:40:47,814 --> 01:40:50,673
- Are you sure it's him?
- It sounds like sir

1123
01:40:51,894 --> 01:40:53,331
Ask him to face the camera

1124
01:40:54,879 --> 01:40:56,910
Sir, ma'am wants you to step forward

1125
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:06,529
Hi, I am Aryan Khanna. Height 5'10.
Black hair, black eyes

1126
01:41:06,861 --> 01:41:07,966
A big nose

1127
01:41:08,202 --> 01:41:09,860
School: Kendriya Vidyalaya,
New Delhi

1128
01:41:10,711 --> 01:41:12,802
Hans Raj College, Delhi University

1129
01:41:14,398 --> 01:41:16,134
Give me the phone, quick!

1130
01:41:18,051 --> 01:41:19,775
The press will surround me

1131
01:41:21,012 --> 01:41:23,516
Let me in. Or I'll end up
in their arms

1132
01:41:23,747 --> 01:41:25,016
Why is your phone off?

1133
01:41:26,438 --> 01:41:28,095
Can I tell you inside?

1134
01:41:31,143 --> 01:41:31,979
Open the door

1135
01:41:42,082 --> 01:41:44,302
Guys. Dad's here

1136
01:42:10,906 --> 01:42:12,529
Aryan, you're back?

1137
01:42:25,015 --> 01:42:26,532
- Hi
- Hi

1138
01:42:27,065 --> 01:42:29,761
- You're back
- Yes, I'm back

1139
01:42:31,999 --> 01:42:33,178
Are the kids asleep?

1140
01:42:38,517 --> 01:42:40,921
Yes. It's way past their bedtime

1141
01:42:41,446 --> 01:42:42,968
Of course

1142
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:45,254
Let them sleep

1143
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:50,496
Let's relax and talk quietly
in our room

1144
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:55,746
Yes

1145
01:43:01,949 --> 01:43:06,169
- What an entrance exam!
- You passed with flying colours

1146
01:43:06,537 --> 01:43:09,030
I spent my life preparing
for this moment

1147
01:43:09,405 --> 01:43:11,951
Relax. Make yourself a drink.
I'll run the shower for you

1148
01:43:12,326 --> 01:43:13,521
Of course

1149
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:32,445
She was crying. Not easy getting
her to sleep again

1150
01:43:37,237 --> 01:43:40,443
It's better for us both if Isha
stays asleep

1151
01:43:47,435 --> 01:43:48,719
I did say...

1152
01:43:49,883 --> 01:43:52,061
...we could talk calmly

1153
01:43:54,208 --> 01:43:55,485
Why do you need that?

1154
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:57,144
Give

1155
01:43:57,828 --> 01:44:01,365
I have nothing against you
or your children

1156
01:44:03,107 --> 01:44:04,195
Give me that

1157
01:44:07,184 --> 01:44:08,724
Senior ignores me

1158
01:44:10,163 --> 01:44:11,878
You can't let him do that

1159
01:44:14,071 --> 01:44:17,976
Show me Aryan's study, he's
always talking about it

1160
01:44:21,603 --> 01:44:22,706
Sound asleep

1161
01:44:23,878 --> 01:44:25,206
Come, come

1162
01:44:33,593 --> 01:44:36,484
Sit. He lands in 20 minutes.
I haven't much time

1163
01:44:36,987 --> 01:44:38,556
Come on, sit down

1164
01:44:43,618 --> 01:44:45,616
This room has so many stories

1165
01:44:48,139 --> 01:44:50,301
Many stories behind these awards

1166
01:44:51,525 --> 01:44:53,050
In these costumes

1167
01:44:54,882 --> 01:44:57,232
Days that Aryan does not want
to forget

1168
01:44:58,145 --> 01:45:01,677
Memories he wants to keep close
to his heart

1169
01:45:07,865 --> 01:45:10,328
I treasured his memories too

1170
01:45:11,289 --> 01:45:14,405
Kept them right here

1171
01:45:16,913 --> 01:45:21,097
At home, on the walls of my room,
in cupboards

1172
01:45:21,735 --> 01:45:23,312
On shelves like these

1173
01:45:32,706 --> 01:45:36,160
Aryan Khanna filled every corner
of my life

1174
01:45:37,842 --> 01:45:39,396
But he ended it all

1175
01:45:39,779 --> 01:45:43,406
Five minutes! I asked him for
only five minutes

1176
01:45:43,759 --> 01:45:46,394
Know what he said?
It's my life

1177
01:45:46,717 --> 01:45:48,797
Why must I give you even
five seconds of it?

1178
01:45:53,641 --> 01:45:56,653
- I apologise on his behalf
- Why should you apologise?

1179
01:45:58,027 --> 01:46:00,069
I hit Sid Kapoor for his sake

1180
01:46:01,044 --> 01:46:02,527
He was hassling Aryan

1181
01:46:03,461 --> 01:46:06,154
What did Aryan do? Threw me in jail.
Had me beaten

1182
01:46:07,554 --> 01:46:12,109
Said: It's a crime! A crime?

1183
01:46:13,958 --> 01:46:15,485
Crime is what I'll do now

1184
01:46:17,734 --> 01:46:21,495
Breaking hearts of fans who are
devoted to you...

1185
01:46:22,231 --> 01:46:23,777
...is a crime too

1186
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:28,902
You tell me

1187
01:46:30,184 --> 01:46:31,873
Am I so wrong?

1188
01:46:33,151 --> 01:46:36,814
When he fights with you,
doesn't he say sorry?

1189
01:46:39,277 --> 01:46:42,183
So, why can't he say sorry to me?
Tell me!

1190
01:46:42,498 --> 01:46:44,623
Don't do this. I beg you

1191
01:46:44,857 --> 01:46:46,694
What do you mean please?

1192
01:46:47,926 --> 01:46:50,277
He left nothing for me. Why must
I leave anything for him?

1193
01:46:50,622 --> 01:46:52,672
How can I? Impossible

1194
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:55,623
A sham. All lies

1195
01:46:56,645 --> 01:46:59,326
Liar. He's a fake

1196
01:47:00,828 --> 01:47:02,412
The rascal acts all the time

1197
01:47:03,756 --> 01:47:05,280
An actor after all

1198
01:47:13,982 --> 01:47:16,021
I wanted to give him my trophy

1199
01:47:21,462 --> 01:47:23,744
A belated happy birthday,
Aryan Khanna

1200
01:47:45,288 --> 01:47:46,424
Open the door!

1201
01:48:04,183 --> 01:48:06,671
I sent the children to my parents

1202
01:48:07,637 --> 01:48:11,270
They were terrified. I didn't know
what to tell them

1203
01:48:12,359 --> 01:48:15,476
Isha asked me repeatedly: Why did
Papa destroy the study?

1204
01:48:17,174 --> 01:48:17,871
Don't worry. It's ok

1205
01:48:18,117 --> 01:48:21,506
- Why don't we call the police?
- The police will do nothing

1206
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,738
They'll ask for proof. They believe
I'm the criminal

1207
01:48:26,053 --> 01:48:28,582
I came this far in life
on my own steam

1208
01:48:29,939 --> 01:48:31,658
I'll handle it myself

1209
01:48:35,193 --> 01:48:37,327
Play rough like a street hoodlum

1210
01:48:38,144 --> 01:48:40,374
I'll rip him apart. Send him back
to where he belongs

1211
01:48:42,577 --> 01:48:45,210
Gaurav Chandna has seen my star face

1212
01:48:46,539 --> 01:48:48,635
Now he'll see my real face

1213
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:51,533
I'm a Delhi man too

1214
01:48:53,452 --> 01:48:56,819
The dangerous and evil face
on the news is not me

1215
01:48:57,494 --> 01:48:59,160
That person is not me.
Give me time

1216
01:48:59,577 --> 01:49:01,619
I'll prove I've done nothing wrong

1217
01:49:01,859 --> 01:49:05,410
I'd never do anything to make you
ashamed calling me your star

1218
01:49:05,793 --> 01:49:09,132
Aryan Khanna's press conference
proves that he is innocent

1219
01:49:09,442 --> 01:49:13,035
A criminal is impersonating him
and committing crimes

1220
01:49:13,356 --> 01:49:16,823
Who is the culprit? His name?
His whereabouts?

1221
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:20,663
No one knows the motives
behind his terrible actions

1222
01:49:22,285 --> 01:49:27,060
The police have informed us that
they're very hopeful...

1223
01:49:27,398 --> 01:49:30,244
...this criminal will not escape them

1224
01:49:30,657 --> 01:49:33,015
When he's arrested, he'll be
severely punished

1225
01:49:57,444 --> 01:49:58,637
Hello, Gauru

1226
01:49:59,761 --> 01:50:00,428
Mummy

1227
01:50:01,094 --> 01:50:03,767
What's wrong with your phone?
Where are you, Gauru?

1228
01:50:04,326 --> 01:50:05,041
Right here

1229
01:50:05,859 --> 01:50:06,619
I'm ok

1230
01:50:08,424 --> 01:50:09,247
And you?

1231
01:50:09,589 --> 01:50:12,761
Son, come home soon.
We're in trouble

1232
01:50:15,747 --> 01:50:19,271
You've roamed the world, now return
to your home

1233
01:50:23,622 --> 01:50:24,235
Aryan?

1234
01:50:26,187 --> 01:50:27,425
You barged into my home?

1235
01:50:28,297 --> 01:50:31,496
You can barge into mine, can't I
do the same?

1236
01:50:33,456 --> 01:50:35,973
I came here to grab your
parents by the throat

1237
01:50:36,204 --> 01:50:38,346
To ask why they produced
a nasty son like you

1238
01:50:39,412 --> 01:50:42,412
- But I am not a lowlife like you
- Don't drag my parents into this

1239
01:50:42,918 --> 01:50:44,379
They did nothing

1240
01:50:45,329 --> 01:50:46,320
What did my kids do?

1241
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:50,411
I went alone into your fortress.
Did you bring an army?

1242
01:50:50,675 --> 01:50:52,499
I am here alone, Gaurav Chandna

1243
01:50:52,927 --> 01:50:56,621
No security, no secretary.
No star, no hero

1244
01:50:57,019 --> 01:50:59,371
If you have the guts, face me

1245
01:50:59,759 --> 01:51:00,965
Settle the score

1246
01:51:02,618 --> 01:51:05,454
The score will only be settled
when you apologise

1247
01:51:06,537 --> 01:51:09,537
Get on the stage at the Inder Vihar
contest and say sorry

1248
01:51:09,779 --> 01:51:10,704
And listen...

1249
01:51:11,621 --> 01:51:14,121
If you touch my parents with
a feather even...

1250
01:51:14,730 --> 01:51:18,787
I know your mother-in-law's house,
where your children are hiding

1251
01:51:20,028 --> 01:51:21,746
Your daughter is very cute, by God

1252
01:51:25,650 --> 01:51:28,101
- Your son is stubborn like you
- You rascal

1253
01:51:28,666 --> 01:51:32,341
I'll bury you in a gutter here, if you
dream of harming my kids

1254
01:51:36,053 --> 01:51:37,787
What will my parents think?

1255
01:51:39,754 --> 01:51:41,039
Such a big star...

1256
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:44,621
...with such a foul tongue

1257
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:48,537
Forget it

1258
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,719
See you at the contest

1259
01:51:55,140 --> 01:51:56,704
Your son has lost his mind

1260
01:51:57,922 --> 01:52:01,009
- He's crossed the line
- Our Gaurav was not like that

1261
01:52:01,712 --> 01:52:03,746
He was a good boy

1262
01:52:05,022 --> 01:52:06,873
He changed after meeting you

1263
01:52:08,043 --> 01:52:10,572
What would you have lost
if you gave him 5 mins?

1264
01:52:10,885 --> 01:52:12,537
Don't blame Aryan

1265
01:52:13,084 --> 01:52:14,135
It's our fault

1266
01:52:15,764 --> 01:52:18,977
We let him get obsessed by
your glamorous life

1267
01:52:20,112 --> 01:52:23,101
Not your hard slog. He would've
followed your example

1268
01:52:23,753 --> 01:52:26,901
Worked hard and become someone

1269
01:52:28,361 --> 01:52:31,942
Then the call center girl could've
become his girlfriend or wife

1270
01:52:35,186 --> 01:52:36,371
He has a girlfriend?

1271
01:52:37,373 --> 01:52:40,621
A one-way romance.
Gaurav loves her but...

1272
01:52:40,893 --> 01:52:44,697
Enough. We have to accept things
the way they are

1273
01:52:45,074 --> 01:52:48,800
- Where's the contest held?
- The other end of the colony

1274
01:52:50,146 --> 01:52:53,246
Apologise. End this terrible situation

1275
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:55,018
You think I'm wrong too?

1276
01:52:55,313 --> 01:52:56,586
And I must apologise?

1277
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:58,382
Arrest him

1278
01:53:00,617 --> 01:53:02,473
He must be punished

1279
01:53:04,378 --> 01:53:08,164
Imprison him for years, if you must

1280
01:53:12,339 --> 01:53:13,715
But don't beat him

1281
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:15,757
Please

1282
01:54:21,841 --> 01:54:24,381
Hey Junior. Where were you?

1283
01:54:25,007 --> 01:54:27,132
- Hello Uncle, Aunty
- Hello

1284
01:54:27,466 --> 01:54:30,174
Have you been watching the
news on TV about Aryan?

1285
01:54:31,148 --> 01:54:32,341
Never mind

1286
01:54:32,716 --> 01:54:34,974
I have good news for you all

1287
01:54:35,549 --> 01:54:36,948
I've got my American visa

1288
01:54:37,341 --> 01:54:38,757
I knew it

1289
01:54:41,424 --> 01:54:44,216
Why is he standing with his back
to me? It's not like him

1290
01:54:46,081 --> 01:54:48,757
He's going on stage soon,
he's just nervous

1291
01:54:48,994 --> 01:54:50,382
Him? And nervous?

1292
01:54:50,632 --> 01:54:53,696
Has he done anything in life
besides copying Aryan?

1293
01:54:54,589 --> 01:54:57,249
Hey Superstar, your make-up...

1294
01:55:06,591 --> 01:55:07,170
Neha

1295
01:55:10,944 --> 01:55:12,674
I have to talk to you

1296
01:55:15,247 --> 01:55:17,598
Super surprise!

1297
01:55:18,619 --> 01:55:21,299
Western Union - moving money
for better

1298
01:55:21,706 --> 01:55:24,836
Now for the last act of the
Super Star competition

1299
01:55:25,662 --> 01:55:27,424
Our favourite winner

1300
01:55:27,908 --> 01:55:30,980
Our Junior Aryan Khanna

1301
01:55:35,424 --> 01:55:37,129
He's a criminal!

1302
01:55:37,895 --> 01:55:39,142
Get him off the stage

1303
01:55:49,424 --> 01:55:50,549
Calm down

1304
01:55:50,757 --> 01:55:52,727
It's not the real Aryan Khanna

1305
01:55:53,004 --> 01:55:55,632
It's our very own superstar...

1306
01:55:56,174 --> 01:55:57,216
Gaurav Chandna

1307
01:55:57,464 --> 01:55:58,507
Give him a big hand!

1308
01:56:33,441 --> 01:56:36,730
I do a show for Aryan every year

1309
01:56:37,631 --> 01:56:39,907
I know, Aunty. You cheer the loudest

1310
01:56:41,439 --> 01:56:42,674
But this year's show...

1311
01:56:44,105 --> 01:56:45,427
The show today is for...

1312
01:56:46,884 --> 01:56:47,710
...someone else

1313
01:56:48,874 --> 01:56:51,788
The girl over there who is...

1314
01:56:52,494 --> 01:56:54,416
...smiling at me. She's my friend

1315
01:56:55,685 --> 01:56:56,682
Neha!

1316
01:56:57,536 --> 01:56:58,810
Come, babes

1317
01:57:05,411 --> 01:57:08,846
There's something I've kept
in my heart for days

1318
01:57:12,477 --> 01:57:13,161
I love you, Neha

1319
01:57:15,852 --> 01:57:17,935
- I love you too, Aryan
- Not Aryan

1320
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:20,477
Gaurav loves you

1321
01:57:23,089 --> 01:57:25,454
Gaurav loves Neha

1322
01:57:27,478 --> 01:57:28,316
What nonsense!

1323
01:57:28,812 --> 01:57:29,520
Get lost

1324
01:57:29,871 --> 01:57:32,226
- He's nuts
- Thinks he's real Aryan Khanna

1325
01:57:32,581 --> 01:57:33,228
Get him off

1326
01:57:33,512 --> 01:57:36,696
Wait! He is talking to me.
I'll deal with it

1327
01:57:39,111 --> 01:57:41,541
I love you!

1328
01:57:42,103 --> 01:57:44,452
Drop it. You love only Aryan

1329
01:57:44,741 --> 01:57:46,238
He can go to hell

1330
01:57:46,561 --> 01:57:49,439
- Is that you talking?
- It's not just talk

1331
01:57:49,932 --> 01:57:50,978
I've sent him to hell

1332
01:57:52,088 --> 01:57:54,203
I fixed Aryan Khanna for good

1333
01:57:54,612 --> 01:57:57,014
First in London, then in Dubrovnik

1334
01:57:57,735 --> 01:58:00,160
I made my way into his house too

1335
01:58:03,044 --> 01:58:05,705
Smashed everything in sight

1336
01:58:06,955 --> 01:58:09,850
If you don't believe me, read the
papers. Watch TV or the Net

1337
01:58:10,679 --> 01:58:13,514
Your Gaurav is famous the world over

1338
01:58:14,649 --> 01:58:16,222
I'm no less than Aryan

1339
01:58:16,655 --> 01:58:17,796
Not at all

1340
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:20,651
I am a star in real life

1341
01:58:21,606 --> 01:58:24,351
Not a star. A monster

1342
01:58:24,813 --> 01:58:25,646
What?

1343
01:58:25,938 --> 01:58:28,281
They all think you're a star

1344
01:58:28,606 --> 01:58:30,667
While you shamed Inder Vihar

1345
01:58:31,045 --> 01:58:32,132
Listen to her

1346
01:58:32,487 --> 01:58:34,563
I became a monster for her

1347
01:58:34,902 --> 01:58:36,479
I don't want to know a monster

1348
01:58:36,729 --> 01:58:38,806
A monster! Forget it

1349
01:58:39,022 --> 01:58:41,702
Take my hand and say:
I love you too

1350
01:58:42,021 --> 01:58:43,229
- Let go
- I won't

1351
01:59:05,584 --> 01:59:06,708
I'm very sorry, Neha

1352
01:59:07,254 --> 01:59:08,006
Are you ok?

1353
01:59:08,204 --> 01:59:09,208
Thank you

1354
01:59:09,718 --> 01:59:12,073
Aryan. He's a good guy

1355
01:59:17,353 --> 01:59:18,086
Gaurav!

1356
01:59:26,875 --> 01:59:27,872
Get down!

1357
02:03:59,533 --> 02:04:00,574
Enough!

1358
02:04:02,491 --> 02:04:04,408
Enough of this game

1359
02:04:05,491 --> 02:04:06,193
Get up!

1360
02:04:11,574 --> 02:04:12,908
I am happy in my life

1361
02:04:14,116 --> 02:04:15,824
Can't you be happy in yours?

1362
02:04:19,283 --> 02:04:20,824
Be a good son to your parents

1363
02:04:22,616 --> 02:04:24,408
A good friend, a good boyfriend

1364
02:04:26,283 --> 02:04:28,741
Stop being a fan

1365
02:04:35,908 --> 02:04:37,949
What's the difference between us?

1366
02:04:39,866 --> 02:04:41,741
I came from the same streets

1367
02:04:42,491 --> 02:04:44,199
I had normal parents like you

1368
02:04:45,366 --> 02:04:47,741
A regular house, regular school,
regular friends

1369
02:05:04,962 --> 02:05:06,577
I made my way up alone

1370
02:05:08,965 --> 02:05:10,449
Not in anyone's shadow

1371
02:05:13,658 --> 02:05:14,449
I'm human

1372
02:05:16,354 --> 02:05:20,169
I laugh and cry, get mad like you.
I have a family. Responsibilities

1373
02:05:21,205 --> 02:05:23,855
I don't have the time to meet
all my fans

1374
02:05:32,462 --> 02:05:33,731
I'll say it again

1375
02:05:35,833 --> 02:05:37,158
I'll forget all this

1376
02:05:38,514 --> 02:05:39,610
You do the same

1377
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:41,491
Start over

1378
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,949
Not as Junior Aryan Khanna

1379
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:51,658
See how it feels like to be
Gaurav Chandna

1380
02:05:55,845 --> 02:05:56,658
Come!

1381
02:06:02,889 --> 02:06:04,916
The joy of living as yourself...

1382
02:06:05,487 --> 02:06:07,807
...cannot be matched by living
as another

1383
02:06:09,219 --> 02:06:10,203
Stop now

1384
02:06:12,433 --> 02:06:13,612
Live your life

1385
02:06:14,814 --> 02:06:16,121
Let me live mine

1386
02:06:24,593 --> 02:06:25,949
Where to, Senior?

1387
02:06:27,904 --> 02:06:30,502
You destroyed me and ask me
to let you live your life?

1388
02:06:34,804 --> 02:06:35,772
And my life?

1389
02:06:38,671 --> 02:06:40,999
You took everything from me

1390
02:06:43,134 --> 02:06:44,717
My parents' love

1391
02:06:45,634 --> 02:06:47,176
Neha's friendship

1392
02:06:49,509 --> 02:06:51,384
My neighbours' smiles

1393
02:07:00,176 --> 02:07:02,600
You were my lifeline, Senior

1394
02:07:05,565 --> 02:07:06,676
You cut the connection

1395
02:07:08,596 --> 02:07:11,176
OK. I'll do as you say

1396
02:07:13,842 --> 02:07:15,217
I'll stop this game

1397
02:07:20,176 --> 02:07:22,240
I can separate myself from you

1398
02:07:25,252 --> 02:07:28,878
But you can never separate
my name from yours

1399
02:07:35,606 --> 02:07:36,842
You said everything

1400
02:07:40,473 --> 02:07:42,043
But you never said sorry

1401
02:07:47,233 --> 02:07:48,092
Gaurav!

1402
02:07:48,885 --> 02:07:49,926
No, Gaurav

1403
02:07:51,066 --> 02:07:52,092
It's not over

1404
02:07:52,580 --> 02:07:54,085
Think of your parents

1405
02:07:56,478 --> 02:07:57,384
Stop this madness

1406
02:08:15,111 --> 02:08:18,820
Forget it. You won't understand

1407
02:10:05,102 --> 02:10:09,102
Aryan Khanna has cleared
his name completely

1408
02:10:09,685 --> 02:10:13,018
But Inder Vihar's Gaurav Chandna...

1409
02:10:13,477 --> 02:10:16,715
...has tied his name to superstar
Aryan's name forever

1410
02:10:17,044 --> 02:10:20,852
A wave of love greets Aryan's
on his birthday today

1411
02:10:21,145 --> 02:10:26,018
Fans are singing his songs. They're
here in their thousands

1412
02:10:27,971 --> 02:10:28,902
It's time

1413
02:10:32,582 --> 02:10:34,151
Everyone is waiting

1414
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:20,000
