1
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,358
Exiting time knot, sir.
We're... alive.

2
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,237
We made it.

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,437
By Grabthar's hammer,
we live to tell the tale.

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,630
'Systems functional.'

5
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,711
All systems working, Commander.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,156
I don't like it. It was too easy.

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,392
Wait! Oh, no. They're everywhere!

8
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,040
- Time knots are opening everywhere!
- A trap!

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,395
We're surrounded, Commander.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,112
It's a core meltdown, sir.
It can't be stopped.

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,113
- Surrender may be our only option.
- No! Never give up!

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,031
Never surrender!

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,395
Your orders, sir?

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,315
Sir? Your orders?

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,518
Activate the Omega 13.

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,239
Well? Huh?

17
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,993
Well, there you are.

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,391
Yeah! Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about!

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,948
You are the first people to see

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,511
the lost Galaxy Quest
episode 92 two-parter...

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,398
since it was aired in 1982!

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,789
Huh? Yeah! All right.

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,792
Now, the moment
you've been waiting for.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,758
The intrepid crew...

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,276
of the NSEA Protector! Yeah!

26
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,556
Red scarf, black shoes. Wait.

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,995
White scarf, black buttons,

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,798
white shoes.

29
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,678
Man, where is he?
An hour and a half late?

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,228
- An hour and a half.
- This is unreal.

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,993
They're gonna start
eating each other.

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,277
Did you hear?
He booked an appearance without us.

33
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,554
You're kidding?

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,638
Oh. Uh... um...

35
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,112
How did I come to this?

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,269
Not again.

37
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,113
- I played Richard III.
- Five curtain calls.

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,272
Five curtain calls.
I was an actor once, now look at me!

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,399
I can't go out there, and I won't
say that stupid line one more time!

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,397
I can't, I won't.

41
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,277
At least you had a part.

42
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,635
You had a character people loved.

43
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,429
My TV Guide interview
was six paragraphs about my boobs

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,351
and how they fit into my suit.

45
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,477
No one even asked me
what I DO on the show.

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,478
You had the...

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,516
Wait. Wait, I'll think of it.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,717
- I repeated the computer, Fred.
- Whew!

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,717
Your commander is on deck!

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,119
Ha ha!

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,873
Wow, that smog is thick today, huh?

52
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,713
Am I late
for Alexander's panic attack?

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,597
Apparently not.

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,557
You should get that looked at.

55
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,437
Yeah.

56
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,233
Let's see a few more clips.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,710
OK. What did I do? Hmm?

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,869
What?

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,837
We want the crew!

60
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,559
... same affection for the crew

61
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,790
as the crew had for each other.

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,670
These weren't just adventurers
exploring space. These were friends.

63
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,433
- Unbelievable.
- You are so full of it!

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,274
These guys put a little set
in their basement. I'm there an hour.

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,351
It's nothing, Gwen.

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,032
They wanted the Commander.

67
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,998
- There he goes.
- Alexander, wait! Grab him!

68
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,270
We want the crew!

69
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,830
OK! Yeah! Here we go!

70
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,309
- Come on, old friend.
- Old friend?!

71
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,358
You stole my lines -
cut me out of episode two!

72
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,910
Tawny Madison,
my personal favourite,

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,275
Gwen DeMarco!

74
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,112
Yeah!

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,316
'Lt's getting hotter, Commander.'

76
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,755
That's what I'm talkin' about!

77
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,595
Let's hear a warm welcome for
crack gunner Laredo... Tommy Webber!

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,275
- You will go out there!
- I won't.

79
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,989
- And nothing you say will make me.
- The show must go on.

80
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,832
... Freddie Kwan!

81
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,556
Damn you.

82
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,998
Damn you. I won't say
that stupid line one more time.

83
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,311
Tev'Meck... Alexander Dane!

84
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,595
Yeah! All right!

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,353
'By Grabthar's Hammer,
you shall be avenged! '

86
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,034
Yeah! All right!

87
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,877
That guy can act.

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,635
And finally, my... fellow Questerians,

89
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,435
the brave commander
of the NSEA Protector,

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,356
Peter...

91
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,277
Quincy

92
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,351
Taggert

93
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,795
Jason Nesmith!

94
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,393
Yeah!

95
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,954
We love you, Commander!

96
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,950
- Never give up...
- Never surrender!

97
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,635
Damn the resonance cannons,
full speed ahead! Huh?

98
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,028
The Commander and crew
will be signing autographs

99
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,918
on decks C and B
near the Coke machines.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,390
Whoo! Quest forever, man!

101
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,151
Excuse me,
crew member coming through.

102
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,913
- Fans, right? Hey, Gwen.
- Oh, hey, man.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,072
Hey man, thanks for that intro
you gave us. Um...

104
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,835
Guy. Probably don't remember me,
do you? It's the sunglasses.

105
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,480
I was on the show in '82, episode 81.

106
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,439
Got killed by a lava monster
before the first commercial.

107
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,116
Listen, uh... maybe I could sit in
and, uh, sign some autographs?

108
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,113
By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons
of Warvan, I shall avenge you!

109
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,596
By Grabthar's...

110
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,673
Next.

111
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,718
Had I moved an inch
the beast would have killed me,

112
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,756
but my crew was in danger.

113
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,990
How did you know what to do?

114
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,550
Come on! Without my crew,
I'm not a commander, huh?

115
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,757
And we all remember
what happened on Enok Vll.

116
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,555
You've gotta admit,
they really do love him.

117
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,393
Almost as much as he loves himself.

118
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,674
Excuse me, Commander. Hey!

119
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,311
I was wondering if you could help
settle a dispute my crew and I have.

120
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,631
Um, if you remember,
uh, in "Quasar Dilemma..."

121
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,473
Excuse me for a minute, fellas.

122
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,075
What about the relevant conundrum?

123
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,072
In episode 15, "Mist of Delos V"

124
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,153
I got the feeling that you
and the Commander had a thing.

125
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,719
Did you?

126
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,633
No. The Commander and I
never had a thing.

127
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,439
Well, that's her story.

128
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,832
Excuse me.

129
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,912
Gwen.

130
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,709
Gwen!

131
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,592
Gwen!

132
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,517
- Commander.
- Excuse me.

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,876
I must speak to you.
It is of supreme importance.

134
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,509
We are Thermians
and... we... need your help.

135
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,910
Oh, oh, oh.
Is this about that gig tomorrow?

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,788
Hammer it out with my agent,
and make sure there's a limo.

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,839
Last time I did one of these gigs,
they shoved me in a Toyota.

138
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,275
Remember, mum's the word.

139
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,073
- Certainly, but um...
- Mum.

140
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,839
Mum. Mum. Mu-um.

141
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,471
And... Beautiful!

142
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,356
Crewman Madison,
the mist of this strange planet

143
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,159
is filling my head
with such thoughts.

144
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,118
It was cute when I didn't know you.

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,512
What a freak show, man.
Oh, this is hilarious.

146
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,434
Bunch of losers! Beggin'
for autographs at 15 bucks a pop.

147
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,035
These guys haven't had
a real acting job for 20 years.

148
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,671
Nesmith gets off on those retards
thinking he's a space commander!

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,430
And his friends can't stand him!
Did you hear them ragging on him?

150
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,274
He has no idea he's a laughing stock,
even to his buddies.

151
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,316
- He's pathetic!
- Come on.

152
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,355
- The Galaxy Quest Dancers are on.
- Whoo! Full speed ahead, Lieutenant.

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,192
Hey, Commander, uh,

154
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,159
so in "The Quasar Dilemma"
you used the auxiliary deck B...

155
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,800
Get this...
Deck B for gamma override.

156
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,718
But the online
blueprints indicate...

157
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,429
that deck B is independent
of the guidance matrix.

158
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,590
So where is the error in that?

159
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,116
It's just a television show.
That's all, OK?

160
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,432
Right, but... We were wondering
if the quantum flux...

161
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,197
There is no quantum flux. There's no
auxiliary. There's no goddam ship!

162
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,032
You got it?

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,755
I mean it, Alex. I've never seen him
lose it like that. Not to a fan.

164
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,831
I mean, it was just weird.

165
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,152
Gwen, I have said it for years.

166
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,151
He's mentally unstable.

167
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,800
I... l'm worried.

168
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,478
It just was not like him.

169
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,557
'As long as there is injustice,

170
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,393
'whenever a Targathian baby
cries out,

171
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,512
'wherever a distress signal
sounds among the stars,

172
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,479
'we'll be there,
this fine ship, this fine crew.'

173
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,996
- Never give up...
- 'Never give up...

174
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,156
'Never surrender.'

175
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,715
- Can I help you?
- Sir, this is terrible protocol.

176
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,634
- You shouldn't come here, man.
- I beg you to hear our plea.

177
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,393
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula.

178
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,632
Our people are being slaughtered
by Sarris of Fatu-Krey.

179
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,396
We have met in negotiation. However,
our efforts have been disastrous.

180
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,837
Please, Commander.
You are our last hope.

181
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,393
- We have secured our limousine.
- What?

182
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,914
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

183
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,073
Um, it's the thing
for the thing that's, um...

184
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,520
Ha. Maybe I should get some pants on.

185
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,436
Come on in.

186
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,471
Commander,

187
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,711
I must say that
standing here in your presence...

188
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,873
is the greatest honour we
could ever have hoped to achieve.

189
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,394
That's... I really appreciate that.

190
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,392
Would you look
for another shoe like this?

191
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,758
Sir, I am Lahnk,
senior requisition officer.

192
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,071
Please let me know
if you have any requirements.

193
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,199
- Weapons, documents, personnel.
- Um, a Coca-Cola?

194
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,636
Sir, I am Teb.

195
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,829
I would like to explain
our history in greater detail.

196
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,195
Hey, how ya doin'?

197
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,353
In the years following the Great
Nebula Burst, our people were one...

198
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,590
What's your name?

199
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,355
- Doesn't she talk?
- Her translator is broken.

200
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,039
Okey dokey.

201
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,830
You know, guys, I had a late night
with a Kreemorian fangor beast

202
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,708
so... l'm gonna just
shut my eyes for a bit.

203
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,839
Go on. You know? I'm listening
to everything you say, OK?

204
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,078
Following the Great Nebula Burst
our people were one people.

205
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,870
But then came the Zactor Migration,
and then the Melosian Shift

206
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,919
and a dark period of discontent
spread through the land.

207
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,551
Fighting among Treeb sects
and Largoths... ah, the foolishness!

208
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,235
And it was in this time
of dissension that Sarris...

209
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,755
- Commander. Commander?
- Hmm.

210
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,868
I'm sorry, sir, but your presence
is requested on the command deck.

211
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,878
Mm.

212
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,511
Sir, Sarris has moved the deadline.
We are approaching his ship now.

213
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,875
He wants an answer to his proposal.

214
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,594
I got most of it.
Sarris is the bad guy?

215
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,194
Yes, sir. He's a very bad man indeed.

216
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,396
He has tortured our scientists,

217
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,916
captured our females
for his own demented purposes...

218
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,231
Yeah. Do you have pages
or should I just wing this?

219
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,550
I am not sure I understand you.

220
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,835
- Welcome to Protector Two.
- Hi.

221
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,111
- Would you like your uniform?
- I'll skip that,

222
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,839
I got this gig in Van Nuys
in 15 minutes.

223
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,993
- As you wish.
- Sir, it's Sarris. He's here.

224
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,473
General, the Thermians
have appointed a new commander

225
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,835
to handle the negotiations.

226
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,911
What?

227
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,239
This is great. Usually it's
just cardboard walls in the garage.

228
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,154
Sir, we apologise
for operating in low-power mode

229
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,915
but we are experiencing
a... reflective flex field.

230
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,357
You know what I could use?
A cup holder and a couple of Advil.

231
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,635
Approaching, sir. Command to slow?

232
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,188
Set it on screensaver two.

233
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,154
We, you know... gotta...

234
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,755
Oh, I'm sorry
to break up the mood here.

235
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,593
Um, slow it down to mark two,
Lieutenant.

236
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,631
'I see fear.

237
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,439
- 'That is expected.'
- Mm-hm.

238
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,672
- 'Ahh, they bring a new commander.'
- It's good.

239
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,196
- 'Here are my demands.'
- Scary. It looks... real.

240
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,874
'And if I do not hear what I like

241
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,193
'then there will be blood and pain
as you cannot imagine! '

242
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,669
- 'First... '
- Ahh, backwash.

243
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,955
'I require the Omega 13.

244
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,589
'Second, I will require
a technician... '

245
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,673
Okey dokey! Let's fire
blue particle cannons full,

246
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,557
red particle cannons full,

247
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,349
gannet magnets, left and right
and let 'em run all chutes.

248
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,671
And while you're at it,
toss that at 'em, killer!

249
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,394
That should
take care of lobster head.

250
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,276
Commander, where are you going?

251
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,231
- Home.
- You... mean Earth?

252
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,151
Yeah, back to Earth, kids.

253
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,038
But the negotiations,
y- you fired on him.

254
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,395
Yeah. What's your planet called?

255
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,630
- Thermia.
- Long live Thermia.

256
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,358
What if Sarris survives?

257
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,193
- I doubt it.
- He has a very powerful ship.

258
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,192
If you got any more problems,
give me a call.

259
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,838
Ow!

260
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,075
- An interstellar vox.
- A what? Hey.

261
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,598
How can we thank you, Commander?
You... You have saved our people.

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,437
Yeah. OK. You know, you kids
have been great. You really have.

263
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,590
This thing is real lookin'.

264
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,433
Yoo-hoo. Hello?

265
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,193
Hey! Where's my limo?

266
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,277
Huh?

267
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,990
Oh!

268
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,668
Take it from us,
we've been all over the universe.

269
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,753
But we've never seen
space-age values like these, at...

270
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,991
Tech Value Electronic Superstore!

271
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,478
By Grabthar's hammer...

272
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,876
what a savings.

273
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,349
All right! Yeah,
let's hear it for the NSEA Protector.

274
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,353
...vacuum laser...
- No, you've got it all wrong.

275
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,991
- Brandon, are you OK?
- Oh, Commander! My apologies.

276
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,629
Evidently, we had
a miscommunication regarding...

277
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,917
the voyage - you didn't show up.

278
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,031
He... He did it again.

279
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,350
Do you know what time it is? Why do
you even bother to show up at all?

280
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,671
No, no, not now. Guys, I was there.

281
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,716
I was up there.

282
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,315
Remember those people dressed
like aliens? They were aliens.

283
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,790
Termites or Dalmatians.
I can't remember cos I was hungover.

284
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,032
What they'd built was extraordinary.
It was a huge spaceship.

285
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,795
I got to fight this guy named Sarris
and I kicked his ass!

286
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,393
I know what you think. But I can
prove it. They gave me this.

287
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,357
No, no, no, no. But can you
talk to people in space on those?

288
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,635
Protector, this is the Commander!

289
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,553
- For God's sake.
- That's it. Time to go!

290
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,599
This isn't mine.
That kid. Where's that kid?

291
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,877
Commander, we come with news.
Sarris lives.

292
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,269
- He was able to escape.
- Tell them.

293
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,432
However, he wishes
to negotiate a surrender.

294
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,195
We humbly implore you
to come and negotiate the terms.

295
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,430
Huh? You want me back?

296
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,559
Is this amazing? They want me back
and I want you guys to come!

297
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,949
Think about it. Let's go. Yes!

298
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,156
You're... you're goin'?

299
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,276
Alexander... l'm not kidding.

300
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,669
This isn't a prank.
I'm not kidding.

301
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,558
Guys, listen.
Come on. Gwen, Gwen, Gwen.

302
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,349
Stop. You know me, I'm a lot
of things, but am I crazy?

303
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,795
It's one thing to treat us this way.

304
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,678
It's another thing
to do it to your fans.

305
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,673
She's not a fan!
This is... This is a Termite!

306
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,069
You should've just let me hit him.

307
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,994
Boy, I didn't know
you could get that loaded.

308
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,117
I think we should've
just taken the gig.

309
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,634
Who knows
the next time he'll ask us?

310
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,117
Fred, he was drunk. Do you really
think he was talking about a job?

311
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,911
Did Jason come through here?

312
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,753
Yeah, he... he's in there. Hey, guys.

313
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,276
Ah. We are coming, too.

314
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,148
- You wish to go to the ship?
- Yes, we wish to go to the ship.

315
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,198
You see, we work together,
or not at all.

316
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,035
Wonderful. The Commander had me
continue in case you decided to.

317
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,432
- Request four interstellar...
- Oh! Me, too.

318
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,835
Five pods for immediate departure.

319
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,920
Guys. Guys?

320
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,879
I look forward to meeting you
when you arrive at the ship.

321
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,518
End transmission.

322
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,188
Oh, my God.

323
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,878
Anybody got any change?

324
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,233
Oh!

325
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,355
Our most sincere apologies. We forgot
about our appearance generators.

326
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,998
You guys came!

327
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,877
Who wants the grand tour?

328
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,709
Anybody else?

329
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,156
That was a hell of a thing.

330
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,433
- What's wrong with them?
- I don't know. Come on.

331
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,709
That's right, shake it off.
It gets better.

332
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,354
- Try some gum. It helps.
- Where are we?

333
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,150
The 23rd quadrant
of the gamma sector. I'll show you.

334
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,277
- My friends!
- This is Mathesar, their leader.

335
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,515
On behalf of my people I thank you
from the deepest place in our hearts.

336
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,114
Mathesar, this is, uh, my crew.

337
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,592
Dr Lazarus.

338
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,672
Dr Lazarus. Dr Lazarus.

339
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,238
Lieutenant Madison.

340
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,788
Lieutenant Madison.

341
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,917
Young Laredo, how you've grown.

342
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,672
Young Laredo.

343
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,758
Tech Sergeant Chen.

344
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,513
Tech Sergeant Chen.

345
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,359
C- Crew man number si... Guy.

346
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,396
Guy.

347
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,677
You... know us?

348
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,111
I don't believe
anyone on my planet does not.

349
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,193
Since receiving transmission
of your historical documents

350
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,795
we have studied
all of your missions and strategies.

351
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,552
You watch the show?

352
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,237
- Lieutenant, historical documents.
- Historical documents from out here?

353
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,232
Yes. Our society
had fallen into disarray.

354
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,828
Our goals and values were scattered.

355
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,835
But we have modelled every aspect
of our society from your example,

356
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,876
and it has saved us.

357
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,397
Your courage and teamwork
and friendship through adversity.

358
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,436
All you see has been taken

359
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,229
from the lessons garnered
from the historical documents.

360
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,794
Is this a... a spaceship?

361
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,873
No, this is a starport for the ship.

362
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,315
Would you guys like to see the ship?

363
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,755
Oh, my God!

364
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,075
It's real.

365
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,191
The generator room.

366
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,153
The beryllium sphere, of course.

367
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,198
The medical quarters are to the left.

368
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,831
We went to some trouble duplicating
your cellular regeneration system...

369
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,232
- Jason, what have you got us into?
- Wow, the floors are so clean.

370
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,517
We're just negotiating a surrender.
No big deal.

371
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,559
...and the organ fabrication chamber
is coming along nicely.

372
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,031
No big deal? Are you crazy?
We have to get out of here.

373
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,795
- Come on, guys.
- We're actors, not astronauts.

374
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,635
You guys wanna go home, we'll go
home - pay our bills, feed our fish,

375
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,872
fall asleep in front of the TV
and miss out on all this.

376
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,560
Come on.
Do you guys wanna do that? Anybody?

377
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,399
Gwen, look where we are.
We're in space.

378
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,632
Alexander, this is the role
of a lifetime. You wanna leave?

379
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,759
We have prepared
many of your esoteric dishes.

380
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,116
Your Monte Cristo sandwich
is a favourite here.

381
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,151
The main barracks.

382
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,236
At ease.

383
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,436
It's like throwing gasoline
on a flame.

384
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,957
What?

385
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,152
I'm just jazzed
about being on the show, man.

386
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,752
If you would
take your positions.

387
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,472
Our what?

388
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,879
Guys.

389
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,956
Oh. Hmm.

390
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,391
Look, this thingy.

391
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,873
I remember... I had it all worked out.

392
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,838
This is forward. This is back.

393
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,112
Commander, some the crew want
to be present at this historic event.

394
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,518
Sure. Bring 'em in.

395
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,192
No pressure, huh?
I'm glad I ain't the Commander.

396
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,995
Laredo, take us out.

397
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,957
Excuse me?

398
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,352
They designed those
controls after watching you.

399
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,955
- Take her out.
- Right, right.

400
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,031
OK.

401
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,633
Right.

402
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,877
Right. Take her out.

403
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,797
OK.

404
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,598
Move more to the right.

405
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,797
Would you sit your ass down? Move!
You wanna drive?

406
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,395
Oh. Mmm.

407
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,915
How is your steak, Commander?

408
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,635
I'm really enjoying it.
This is like corn-fed lowa beef.

409
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,317
We programmed the food synthesiser
based on the menu of your birthplace.

410
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,073
I don't care,
it tastes great.

411
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,197
Are your Kep-mok bloodticks,
Dr Lazarus?

412
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,635
Just like Mother used to make.

413
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,639
So... tell me, Mathesar,

414
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,234
this Sarris person we're meeting.

415
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,595
What does he want?

416
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,150
He heard about the device...
the Omega 13.

417
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,913
Um, what is it? What does it do?

418
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,230
We don't know.

419
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,914
We were hoping
you could enlighten us.

420
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,316
Oh. The Omega 13 device.

421
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,632
We found that on an alien planet.
We don't know what it does either.

422
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,716
Why not just turn it on and see?

423
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,793
It has at its heart a reactor
capable of unthinkable energy.

424
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,032
If we were mistaken, the device
would cause a chain reaction...

425
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,510
that would obliterate
all matter in the universe.

426
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,395
Has Sarris seen any of the...
historical records?

427
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,357
No, thank God, he has not.

428
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,195
Oh. So how does he know
about the Omega 13 device?

429
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,432
Our former commander
was not... strong.

430
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,953
Former commander?

431
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,513
I am sorry. You deserve to be shown.

432
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,796
The tape was smuggled
off of Sarris' ship.

433
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,314
Originally, one of us tried to lead.

434
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,960
'ls that all?

435
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,397
'After three days of this,
you still require... incentive? '

436
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,671
'I have told you
all I know. Please, let me die.'

437
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,072
'When I grow weary of
the noises you make you shall... die.'

438
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,913
Guys, hold on. You can't leave.
Give me time to think.

439
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,834
- He wants to think
- There's nothing to think about!

440
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,912
I'm not supposed to be here.
I'm expendable.

441
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,788
I'm the guy in the episode who dies
to prove it's serious.

442
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,714
- Commander?
- Prepare the pods for my crew.

443
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,318
Sir, we can't. Sarris will detonate
any objects leaving the ship.

444
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,550
- Sarris?
- Yes, sir. He's here.

445
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,712
Your presence is required
on the command deck.

446
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,116
There's nobody here.

447
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,998
My people are talented scientists,

448
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,789
but our tactical simulations
have been disastrous.

449
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,713
I have raised Sarris
on zeta frequency.

450
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,156
- Mathesar...
- 'We meet again, Commander.'

451
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,590
Hello, Sarris. How you doin'?

452
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,910
'Better than my lieutenant.

453
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,793
'He failed to activate
the neutron armour

454
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,509
'as quickly as I'd hoped
on our last encounter.'

455
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,030
Well, I'm real sorry
about what happened before.

456
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,874
The whole thing was just a...
a misunderstanding.

457
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,909
'Deliver the device to me,
or I will destroy your ship! '

458
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,719
You know, um, we'd like do that,

459
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,759
but frankly, we don't know
what it is or even where it is.

460
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,354
'You have 10 seconds! '

461
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't... 10 seconds?

462
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,709
You know... OK. Gosh darn it,
I give up. It's yours.

463
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,679
Give me a minute
to put it in a box for you, OK?

464
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,751
Gwen.

465
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,356
Don't panic. I've dealt with this guy
before. He's as stupid as he is ugly.

466
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,512
- Jason.
- Not now, Gwen. Sit, sit, sit, sit.

467
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,955
We're gonna send everything at him.

468
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,678
- Jason.
- Not now, Gwen!

469
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,672
Push these
and send everything at him, OK?

470
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,197
- OK.
- All right, Gwen, put me back on.

471
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,556
Well, I'm trying to tell you,
you ARE back on.

472
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,997
'Perhaps I'm not as stupid
as I am ugly, Commander! '

473
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,596
I gave you the..."kill" gesture.

474
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,515
No, you gave me the "we're dead"
signal. I was agreeing with you.

475
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,556
Hey, you guys.

476
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,950
There's a red, uh, thingy...

477
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,191
- movin' towards the green thingy.
- What?

478
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,909
Red thingy
moving towards the green thingy...

479
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,197
I think... I think
we're the green thingy.

480
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,511
'A little present for you,
Commander.'

481
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,158
Move this ship! Go!

482
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,993
- Tommy, get us out of here!
- What do I do?!

483
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,593
Go, go, go!

484
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,353
Whoo!

485
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,954
They're turning. They're coming!

486
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,196
Thrust ahead, full!

487
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,748
Fire at will.

488
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,480
Go faster, Tommy!

489
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,599
- I'm going as fast as I can!
- She's still behind us!

490
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,194
I always say "Press the turbo,"
right?

491
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,198
- It's right here!
- Press it and hold it down!

492
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,352
Whoo!

493
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,429
'Enemy matching velocity.'

494
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,751
- Enemy matching velocity.
- We heard the first time!

495
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,832
I'm doing it.
I'm repeating the computer.

496
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,959
'Hi, guys.
Listen, they're tellin' me...

497
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,437
'the, uh...
the generators won't take it.

498
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,355
'The ship is breakin' apart
and all that. Just FYI.'

499
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,228
- We've gotta stop!
- We stop and we die. Tommy, hold on!

500
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,108
- Turbo's only for quick boosts!
- Oh, like you know!

501
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,638
I remember that sound.
That's a bad sound.

502
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,679
Wait, wait! We might be able
to lose them in this cloud.

503
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,275
- I don't think that's a cloud.
- Mathesar, what is it?

504
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,148
The Tothian minefield
from the war of 12185.

505
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,638
Oh, God! Whoo!

506
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,075
Could you possibly try
NOT to hit every single one?

507
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,596
Sorry, man,
I think they're magnetic!

508
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,235
Continue forward, sir?

509
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,557
Patience, Lieutenant.

510
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,638
Patience.

511
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,873
- We've gotta stop!
- We're almost through.

512
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,760
- You OK? You all right?
- Yeah.

513
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,434
Everybody all right? Where's Tommy?

514
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,792
- Oh, man!
- Tommy! You all right?

515
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,515
No, my arm is broke...
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

516
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,916
- I'll take him to Medical quarters.
- Thanks, Mathesar.

517
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,709
Alex, where are you going?

518
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,519
To see if there's a pub!

519
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,076
'Forward thruster shaft,
87% damage.

520
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,038
'Aft vector guards, 96% damage.

521
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,318
'Structural breaches
in quadrants 32, 33, 30... '

522
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,831
- What about the engines?
- 'Forward thrust shaft, 87% damage.'

523
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,038
Computer, what about the engines?
Why don't we have power?

524
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,510
'The beryllium sphere
has fractured under stress.'

525
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,513
- It's fractured.
- Can it be repaired?

526
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,435
- Computer, can it be repaired?
- 'Damage to sphere irreparable.

527
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,991
- 'New source of beryllium needed.'
- We need another one.

528
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,548
You broke the bloody ship!

529
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,237
Eh, ah... Ahem. Computer, is there
a replacement sphere on board?

530
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,518
Computer, is there a replacement
beryllium sphere on board?

531
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,071
'Negative. No reserve beryllium
sphere exists on board.'

532
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,436
No, we have no extra
beryllium sphere on board.

533
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,909
That is really getting annoying!

534
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,912
Look, I have one job
on this lousy ship.

535
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,197
It's stupid, but I'm gonna do it, OK?

536
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,794
Sure, no problem.

537
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,597
A thousand apologies.
We have failed you.

538
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,955
How have you failed us?

539
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,989
We have seen you victorious
in much more desperate situations.

540
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,629
The fault must lie with us,
with the ship.

541
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,315
No, it is not your fault,
and it's not the ship's fault.

542
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,472
It-it's my fault. W-we screwed...

543
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,791
We are not
the people you think we are.

544
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,950
I don't understand.

545
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,194
Didn't you make any TV shows
on your planet? Any theatre? Films?

546
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,158
The historical documents
of your culture.

547
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,755
Yes, in fact, we have begun
to follow your example.

548
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,436
No, not historical documents.
They're not all historical documents.

549
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,069
Surely you don't think
that Gilligan's Island is a...

550
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,594
Those poor people.

551
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,110
Oh, brother.

552
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,270
We're screwed.

553
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,715
Is there no one on your planet
who behaves in a way...

554
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,155
that's contrary to reality?

555
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,118
Ahh! You are speaking of...

556
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,509
- Deception, lies.
- Deception, lies.

557
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,910
We have only recently
become aware of this concept

558
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,831
in our dealings with Sarris.

559
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,151
Often, Sarris will say
one thing and do another.

560
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,800
Promise mercy,
but deliver destruction.

561
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,156
It is a concept we are learning
at some great cost.

562
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:22,519
But if you are saying you could
have traits in common with Sarris...

563
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,755
'Hey, Commander, listen. We found
some beryllium on a nearby planet.

564
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,355
'We might be able to get there

565
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,753
'by reconfiguring the solar matrix in
parallel for endothermic propulsion.

566
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,671
'What do you think? '

567
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,314
- We'll do that!
- All right!

568
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,516
Th-that's right again.

569
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,876
That's... C-Come on, group hug.
Come on.

570
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,071
Dr Lazarus, I hope
I am not breaching protocol,

571
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,516
but I am so very humbled
to stand in your presence.

572
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,512
I have studied your missions
extensively.

573
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,593
Though I am Thermian, I have
lived my life by your philosophy,

574
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,557
by the code of the Mak'tar.

575
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,952
- Oh, good, that's very nice.
- By Grabthar's hammer, Dr L...

576
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,510
- Don't! I'm not kidding.
- Sorry, sir, I was only...

577
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,477
Just don't.

578
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,397
Yes, sir.

579
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,109
Never give up, never surrender.

580
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,316
Dr Lazarus?
Here is your surface mapper.

581
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,755
I have programmed the co-ordinates

582
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,713
of a beryllium sphere
of sufficient density.

583
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,472
Good luck, sir.

584
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,753
Thanks.

585
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,074
You're doing good, Tommy.

586
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,875
I changed my mind. I wanna go back.

587
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,191
After the fuss you made
about getting left behind?

588
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,590
But I thought I was the crewman
that stays on the ship

589
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,671
and something up there kills me.

590
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,594
But what if I'm the guy who's
killed by a monster when we land?

591
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,117
- You won't die on the planet, Guy.
- I'm not? Then what's my last name?

592
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,317
It's, uh, uh... I don't know.

593
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,436
Nobody knows! Do you know why?

594
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,149
Because my character
isn't important enough.

595
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,959
Because I'm gonna die
five minutes in.

596
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,996
Guy, you have a last name.

597
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,157
- Do I?! Do I?!
- Yes!

598
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,471
For all you know,
I'm just crewman number six.

599
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,394
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

600
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,072
Are we there yet?

601
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,395
Mommy!
Tommy!

602
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,830
Look out! Oh, no!
Pull out!

603
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,837
Oh, yeah!

604
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,309
Oh, boy! Yeah!

605
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,990
Don't open that!
It's an alien planet!

606
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,150
Is there air? You don't know!

607
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,437
Seems OK.

608
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,151
Here we go.

609
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,390
Which way, Alexander?

610
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,113
This way!

611
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,557
Wait. No.

612
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,998
- That way.
- You were holding it upside down.

613
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,232
- Shut up.
- I actually thought you were smart.

614
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,356
You could do better, Laredo?

615
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,910
Stop that Laredo stuff.
We're screwed.

616
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,753
Come on,
use some self-control.

617
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,032
That's funny from a guy
who slept with every slave girl

618
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,156
AND moon princess on the show.

619
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,959
If you'd
been more supportive...

620
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,198
Wow. Must be
some sort of mining facility.

621
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,872
Where are the miners?

622
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,315
Something bad happened here.

623
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,476
Will you relax?

624
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,472
There they are.
Beryllium spheres. Let's go.

625
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,791
Look at that.

626
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,030
Would you look at that?

627
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,871
They look like little children.

628
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,075
Could they be the miners?

629
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,998
Sure, they're like, three years old.

630
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,956
Miners, not minors!

631
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,355
- You lost me.
- I don't like this.

632
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,591
- I don't like this at all.
- They are so cute.

633
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,559
Sure, they're cute now,
but in a second, they'll get mean.

634
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,349
They're gonna get ugly somehow,
then there'll be a million more.

635
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,989
Look.
There's a little hurt one.

636
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,353
Aw.

637
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,070
Hi. Hi there.

638
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,038
- Ah!
- Shh!

639
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,873
Did you guys ever WATCH the show?

640
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,236
See? They're gonna help
the little hurt one.

641
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,515
I'm so sick of being right.

642
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,708
Let's go,
before those things kill Guy.

643
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,598
We're not going
without a beryllium sphere.

644
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,433
I need a diversion
to clear the compound.

645
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,511
Then, we'll go get a sphere.

646
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,717
Tommy, if you see them come back
give a signal.

647
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,112
- Why is this so familiar?
- "Assault on Voltareck", episode 81.

648
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,476
- Episode 81?
- The one with the hologram.

649
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,472
How the hell
does Fred project a hologram?

650
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,472
- Is it episode 81?
- It's just a rough plan.

651
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,633
- What difference does it make?
- Cos I died in episode 81!

652
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,792
- Shh! Episode 51, right?
- This is ludicrous.

653
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,476
Why are you listening to this fellow?
This is a costume, not a uniform.

654
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,314
He's no more equipped to lead us
than him. No offence.

655
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,039
Look, they're gone.

656
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,793
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

657
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,599
Nobody was watching?!

658
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,433
Gwen, Fred, Alex and I
will get a sphere.

659
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,790
Fleegman, Tommy, you're lookout.

660
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,952
- You see anything, give us a signal.
- What kind?

661
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,998
- Any kind of signal.
- OK, I'll do this.

662
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,672
Coo! Coo!

663
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,514
What are you, an infant?!
Look, we have these.

664
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,831
That... Sorry.

665
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,194
Let's go.

666
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,435
- Does the rolling help?
- Uh-huh, it helps.

667
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,028
- Where's your gun?
- It helps.

668
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,510
- Oh.
- What?

669
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,034
Ha ha, never give up,
never surrender.

670
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,838
Oh, shut up.

671
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,277
Caw, caw! Jason! They're coming!
There's thousands of 'em!

672
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,238
Run, Jason! Run! Run!

673
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,394
They're everywhere,
they're everywhere!

674
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,913
Everywhere!

675
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,514
Come on, let's go!

676
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,036
Hurry!

677
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,588
They're everywhere! Come on!

678
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,593
Don't look back.
Do not look back!

679
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,557
We're not gonna make it!

680
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,552
I knew it, I knew it!
I knew this was gonna kill me!

681
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,473
Come on! Push!
Let's go, Tommy!

682
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,596
It's gonna take a few seconds.

683
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,318
I got it, I got it!

684
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,834
- Go ahead.
- There's no time. Get in!

685
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,514
You've got to be the hero,
haven't you?

686
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,512
Heaven forbid
anybody else gets the spotlight!

687
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,835
Jason! Jason, come on!

688
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,390
Hurry!
Tommy, go! Go! I'm in!

689
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,432
No, no, no! Jason, please!

690
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,876
- Tommy, stop the pod!
- I can't, it's on autopilot!

691
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,791
Leave him!
No!

692
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,271
Oh, right!

693
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,272
Of course,
it's always about you, isn't it?

694
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,395
Ugh! Oh! Oh! Ugh!

695
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,550
Oh...

696
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,508
Gorignak! Gorignak!
Gorignak! Gorignak!

697
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,917
Jason? Jason, can you hear me?

698
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,031
'Yeah, Gwen, you got me.'

699
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,475
- Thank God. Are you OK?
- 'Yeah.'

700
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,552
Gorignak's staring me
in the face right now.

701
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,996
'But you know what?
I think I can take him.'

702
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,638
Oh.

703
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,598
Jason, we're gonna use
the digital conveyor.

704
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,875
- The digital conveyor?
- 'Yes.'

705
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,919
You're gonna have me diced and
sent up there in a million pieces?

706
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,639
- Right.
- 'Well, you know what?

707
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,553
'I'll take my chances with Gorignak.'

708
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,077
'We're getting you out.
It's perfectly safe, isn't it, Teb? '

709
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,628
It has never been
successfully tested.

710
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,678
- 'What did he say? '
- Hold, please.

711
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,599
Theoretically
it is fully operational.

712
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,752
But it was built
for your... anatomy, not ours.

713
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,400
But Tech Sergeant Chen
can operate it.

714
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,439
It was designed watching him
in the historical documents.

715
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,557
I- I-I mean, I can't.
I- I can supervise...

716
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,278
We're gonna test it.

717
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,397
- On what?
- How about that pig lizard?

718
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,758
- 'I'm doing OK with the pig lizard.'
- Please, Fred? And hurry.

719
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,070
I'm sorry. It's very exciting
to watch the master.

720
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,277
The conveyor is more...
hm... art than science.

721
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,839
Stand back, Jason.

722
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,755
Gorignak, Gorignak, Gorignak...

723
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,519
Oh!

724
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,232
- 'What was that? '
- Uh...

725
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,754
- Nothing.
- 'I heard squealing.'

726
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,276
- Everything's fine.
- But the animal is inside out.

727
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,193
I heard that. It turned inside out?

728
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,591
And it exploded.

729
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,753
Did I just hear that the animal
turned inside out and exploded?

730
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,592
'Hello? '

731
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,551
Hold, please.

732
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,551
'Hey, wait a minute, guys... '

733
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,359
Why are they
still yelling "Gorignak"?

734
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,795
Teb, hit the translation circuit.

735
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,793
'Gorignak... Rock.'

736
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,997
Rock, rock, rock, rock!

737
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,718
Oh!

738
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,157
Jason, I don't think
the pig lizard was Gorignak.

739
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,993
What the hell you talkin' about?

740
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,352
Oh, darn.

741
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,277
Oh.

742
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,952
'Digitise me! '

743
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,871
- Come on.
- 'Digitise me! '

744
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,793
- Not me.
- They based it on your movements.

745
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,912
Am I the only one
who saw that thing inside out?

746
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,675
I'm not Tech Sergeant Chen.
Kwan's not even my real name.

747
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,756
Jason, you'll have to kill it.

748
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,594
Kill it?
Well, I'm open to any suggestions.

749
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,750
Go for the eyes, like episode 22!

750
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,798
It doesn't have any eyes, Tommy.

751
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,757
Go for its vulnerable spots!

752
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,718
It's a rock. It doesn't have any!

753
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,837
I know - construct a weapon.
Look around you.

754
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,270
- Can you form a rudimentary lathe?
- A lathe?!

755
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,796
Get him off!
Alexander, you're my advisor. Advise!

756
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,590
Well, just figure out what it wants.
What is its motivation?

757
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,116
It's a rock monster.
It doesn't have motivation.

758
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,476
See? You were never serious
about the craft.

759
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,991
Oh! Fred, can you hear me?!
Fred, are you there?

760
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,230
- Kinda.
- 'You can do it, Fred! '

761
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,790
Oh, no, no, no. Jason,
I'll just... just mess it up.

762
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,795
- You did it for years on the show!
- That was the show. I'm not him.

763
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,553
You never forgot a line
or missed a mark!

764
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,993
Oh!

765
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,752
That's not me any more.

766
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,991
It is you, Fred.
You just stopped trying.

767
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,873
You can do this.
You're gonna save my life.

768
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,679
- I am?
- 'No doubt about it, Fred.

769
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,913
'Fred!

770
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,309
'Fred, can you hear me? '

771
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,719
'Fred! '

772
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,791
Fred? I don't wanna die down here.

773
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,392
Digitise me, Fred!

774
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,752
Oh, wow.

775
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,070
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Yeah!

776
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,869
You managed to get your shirt off.

777
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,389
- I did it.
- Welcome back, Fred.

778
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,950
All right,
is the beryllium sphere installed?

779
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,715
- Yes, we are back to full power.
- Engines and pods?

780
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,030
- Fully operational.
- Perfect!

781
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,238
You can drop us off and you guys
can be home before supper.

782
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,515
No, we have no reason to go back.

783
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,875
Sure you do. Family, friends...

784
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,951
We are all that is left.

785
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,795
- I didn't know that.
- I have raised the command deck.

786
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,956
Mathesar, meet us
up on the command deck.

787
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,429
Mathesar.

788
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,028
Mathesar! Quellek!

789
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,398
Why can't we reach them?

790
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,752
Commander.
Thank God, you're alive.

791
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,197
Now you will face justice, Sarris.

792
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,274
At every turn, you demonstrate
the necessity for your extermination!

793
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,316
Leave him alone.

794
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,714
You wish to save the life
of this man?

795
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,910
Yeah. Yes.

796
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,589
Then tell me - what does it do,
this Omega 13?

797
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,830
I don't know what it does.

798
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,316
I said, I don't know!

799
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,913
- Is it a bomb?
- I don't know.

800
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,833
- A booby trap?
- I don't know!

801
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,434
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

802
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,235
Do you think I'm a fool?!

803
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,677
That the Commander does not know
every bolt and weld in his ship?!

804
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,912
Prepare a tear harness...

805
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,877
for the female.

806
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,080
No! Gwen, no!

807
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,276
You brute! Let go of me!

808
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:46,638
- I'm not the Commander.
- What did you say?

809
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,678
I said, I'm not the Commander.

810
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,752
Leave them.
There's no reason to hurt them.

811
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,229
- They don't know anything.
- Explain.

812
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,758
Gwen, show him
the historical documents.

813
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,189
Computer,

814
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,319
show the historical documents
of the Galaxy Quest missions.

815
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,356
Wonderful.

816
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,239
You have all done far greater damage
than I ever could have.

817
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,356
Bravo!

818
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,994
Bravo.

819
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,514
This is a moment I will treasure.

820
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,795
Explain to him...

821
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,758
who you all really are.

822
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,996
Tell him!

823
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,357
Explain!

824
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,551
Mathesar, the...

825
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,677
There's no such person
as Captain Taggert.

826
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,754
My name is Jason Nesmith.
I am... an actor.

827
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,956
We're all actors.

828
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,589
He doesn't understand.

829
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,719
Explain, as you would a child.

830
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,354
We, uh... we pretended.

831
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,033
We lied.

832
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,188
Yes! You understand that,
don't you, Mathesar?

833
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,875
Mathesar,
I... l'm not a commander. I...

834
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,669
There's no National Space
Exploration Administration.

835
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,593
We don't have a ship.

836
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,398
But there it is.

837
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,871
That ship is that big.

838
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,997
But inside, I see many rooms.

839
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:09,789
You've seen plywood sets
that look like the inside.

840
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:15,159
Our beryllium sphere
is-is wire with plaster around it.

841
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,356
And our...

842
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,351
Our digital conveyor is...

843
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,511
Christmas tree lights.

844
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,989
It's a decoration. It's all fake.

845
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,231
Just like me.

846
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,798
But why?

847
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,036
It's difficult to explain.

848
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,516
On our planet, we...

849
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:51,239
we pretend to... to entertain and...

850
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,630
Mathesar, I am so sorry.

851
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,359
God, I am so sorry.

852
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,230
So now you know.

853
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:06,474
Lieutenant Lathe, hardwire
the reactor core to overload.

854
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:10,473
I would like to blow
this troublesome vehicle to dust.

855
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,233
Sarris, what about my people?

856
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,471
Yes, far too simple a death
for them, isn't it?

857
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,758
Lathe, open an oxygen seal
on level C.

858
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,037
Let the air in a bit for our friends.

859
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,036
Son of a... Uh!

860
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,320
Release them...

861
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,277
into space.

865
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,479
Hey!

866
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,036
Where's
the happy ending, Jason?

867
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,873
"Never give up, never surrender."

868
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:10,074
Maybe it's about time you just backed
off, you fin-headed monstrosity.

869
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,479
Jason?

870
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,073
You what?

871
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:17,199
You're starting to act
like you did in episode 17,

872
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,396
you scene-stealing hack.

873
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,955
Oh, right!

874
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:29,353
Well, how does it feel, Jason? Was
it worth it? You've murdered us all!

875
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,637
- Shut up.
- Hundreds to die because of you!

876
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,029
- Shut up!
- Get in there.

877
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,511
Just because you wanna play
at being commander, you lunatic.

878
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,716
Then I'll see you in hell.

879
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,070
Look out, Jason!

880
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,590
Get his gun! Get the gun!

881
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,630
Take that!

882
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,914
Sorry... The door's a little sticky.

883
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,798
I'll get someone up here
with a can of WD-30.

884
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,556
- Don't pull your punches.
- Scene-stealing hack?

885
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,393
- Raving egomaniac?
- Where's that from?

886
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,118
Hey, guys...

887
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,918
Iook.

888
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,515
They're suffocating.

Gwen, you and I
will shut the core down manually.

Fred, take Guy and Laliari.
Save those Thermians.

Alexander, wedge a door open
in case they can't.

Wait, what about me? What do I do?

901
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,718
You're gonna practise driving.
Let's go!

902
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,398
Practise driving.

903
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,073
So we get to shut down
a neutron reactor?

904
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,718
I hate to break it to you,

905
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,156
but I don't know
how to shut down a neutron reactor,

906
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:52,756
and unless you took a course, I'm
pretty sure you don't know, either.

907
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,912
No, I don't,
but I know someone who does.

908

Brandon, honey, the garbage.

909
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,035
Oh, Mother, I'm quite busy.

910
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,350
Don't make me ask again.

911
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,274
Just 10 more minutes, OK, Ma?
I promise.

I remember you from the convention.

922
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,789
You asked all those
technical questions about the ship

923
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,996
and I was a little short with you.

924
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,072
Yes, yes, I know, Commander,
and I wanna...

925
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,119
I wanted to tell you that
I- I thought about what you said...

926
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,397
- It's OK. Listen.
- But I want you to know...

927
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,755
I'm not a complete brain case.

928
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,150
I understand completely
that it's just a TV show.

929

H- Hold... Wait. Stop. Wait.

930
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,153
It's all real.

01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,028

I knew it! I knew it!

940
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,310
We're at level C, hallway five.

941
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,152
Um, go to weapons storage,

942
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,959
your second left,
through the passage.

943
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,998
That leads to the utility corridors.

944
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,719
- Open.
- 'I'm gonna get Kyle.'

945
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,473
He knows the utility tunnels best.

946
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,397
...38, 39, 30.

947
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,832
We have to turn off
the valve to the barracks.

948
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,988
- 'Hi, Brandon.'
- No pleasantries, Kyle.

949
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,834
We have an emergency.
You got the utility system map?

950
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,390
I've got sectors one to 28.
Hollister has the others.

951
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,357
'Get everybody online.'

952
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:59,034
- 'Pedal to the metal, Commander.'
- Pedal to the metal, Commander.

953
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,031
General! I have just learned that
the commander of the Protector

954
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,588
and his crew have escaped custody.

955
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,636
What?

956
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,599
- Find them!
- But sir! My men...

957
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,671
The core implosion is...

958
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,035
FIND THEM!

959
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,752
Brandon, I see five ducts in here.
Which way?

960
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,834
The second to your left, and just
continue straight for 50 metres.

961
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,992
Ducts? Why is it always ducts?

962
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,753
'There's a slight drop.'

963
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,433
Whoa!

964
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,635
Uh!

965
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,679
Thanks for the heads-up, Brandon!
You OK?

966
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,556
They're dying.

967
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,589
- We gotta go across this?
- 'Yes.'

968
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,073
Don't look down.

969
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:00,119
'Commander, what I'd give
to see what you're seeing.'

970
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,714
- What?
- You're deep in the Omega 13!

971
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,155
'Oh, it must be spectacular.'

972
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,874
It doesn't look like much to me.

973
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,871
There's just these few walls

974
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,555
and this dumb spinning fan
that's in every single...

975
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,873
Brandon,
what does the Omega 13 device do?

976
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,191
'Many believe
that it is a matter-collapser.'

977
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,319
A bomb capable of destroying
everything in 13 seconds.

978
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,918
'But myself and others are convinced
that it is a matter rearranger,

979
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,560
'a 13-second time jump to the past.'

980
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:50,156
Why 13 seconds? That's really
not enough time to do anything.

981
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,750
- Time to redeem a single mistake.
- What?

982
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,435
We gotta turn off that valve.
Their oxygen's almost gone.

983
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,150
Listen, I'll go in. I'll create
a distraction. I've got this.

984
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,959
I might be able
to hold him long enough.

985
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,396
- That's suicide.
- I'm a glorified extra, Fred.

986
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:17,109
I'm a dead man anyway.
I'd rather die a hero than a coward.

987
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,193
Guy, Guy,
maybe you're the plucky comic relief.

988
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,077
You ever think about that?

989
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,112
Plucky?

990
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,556
Besides, I just had
this really interesting idea.

991
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,551
Are you stoned?

992
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,632
Gotta get them open
and give them some time.

993
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,393
Sir, perhaps together...

994
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,711
the Mak'tar chant of strength,
Larak tarath.

995
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,678
- Larak tarath, larak tarath.
- Larak tarath.

996
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,713
Larak tarath,
larak tarath, larak tarath!

997
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,594
Brandon, we're across. Now what?

998
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:02,559
Take a left and then just
straight on through the chompers.

999
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,312
"The chompers"?

1000
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,631
- Well, screw that.
- How do we get through this?!

1001
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,998
- Hollister, what's the sequence?
- OK, the sequence is...

1002
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,719
two-two-four-two...

1003
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,279
What is this?

1004
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:26,150
There's no useful purpose for a bunch
of chompy things in a hallway!

1005
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,391
We shouldn't have to do this.
Why is it here?!

1006
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:32,597
- Cos it's on the TV show!
- Well, forget it!

1007
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:36,070
I am not doing it!
This episode was badly written!

1008
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,199
- When the first crusher hits you...
- It just did!

1009
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,396
- OK, go now.
- Go!

1010
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,993
'Go!

1011
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,399
'Stop!

1012
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,835
'Go-o! '

1013
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,672
Come on, come on, come on.

1014
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,549
'Go!

1015
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,029
'Go!

1016
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,429
'Go!

1017
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,790
'Go! No, stop! Stop!

1018
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,915
'Go!

1019
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,831
'Stop! '

1020
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,150
'Jump, Commander, jump! '

1021
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,789
Whoever wrote this episode
should DIE!

1022
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,270
This should be interesting.

1023
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,315
It's the simple things
you treasure.

1024
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,711
That's great.

1025
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,150
Now... we better get...

1026
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,277
Hey, get a room, guys.

1027
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,353
Whoa!

1028
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,397
Hey, Fred...

1029
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,715
Hey, Fred, uh...

1030
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:08,039
Oh, that's not right. Oh!

1031
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:38,036
Sir, the pressure - it's normalising.

1032
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,437
All right!

1033
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,235
We are saved.

1034
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,675
He has saved us.

1035
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,309
Commander Taggert has saved us!

1036
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,076
It's just not fair.

1037
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,749
All right, Quellek,
let's get back to the Commander.

1038
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,112
I'm... l'm shot.

1039
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,276
Quellek?

1040
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,871
It's not too bad.

1041
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:37,111
We'll get you to the medical quarters
and you'll be fine.

1042
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,112
It has been an honour
to serve with you.

1043
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,875
I have been blessed, sir. I-I...

1044
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,996
Don't speak, Quellek.

1045
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,474
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir,

1046
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,358
but even though
we had never before met,

1047
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,796
I always considered you
as a father to me.

1048
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,438
Quellek...

1049
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,713
By Grabthar's hammer,

1050
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,951
by the sons of Warvan,

1051
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,114
you shall be... avenged.

1052
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,156
...13, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19!

1053
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,994
- Brandon, how do we stop this?
- 'Push the blue button.'

1054
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,469
- Is that it?
- Why, what's wrong?

1055
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,393
I just thought
it'd be more complicated.

1056
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:09,789
'Core implosion
estimated in 20 seconds.'

1057
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,551
Brandon, it's not working.

1058
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,993
Brandon!

1059
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,432
Mother, I cannot stress enough
the severity

1060
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,996
- of the Commander's predicament.
- And the recyclables!

1061
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,868
'Core implosion
estimated in 10 seconds.

1062
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,956
- 'Nine, eight,'
- Gwen, I...

1063
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,837
- 'seven, six,'
- I always...

1064
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,673
- 'five, four,'
- Jason, oh, Jason.

1065
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,513
'Three, two, one.'

1066
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,833
Oh, it always
stops at one on the show.

1067
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,956
What were you saying?

1068
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,153
- Sir!
- What?

1069
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,073
The detonation sequence
has been aborted.

1070
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,878
Impossible! Lmpossible!

1071
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:10,112
Lock a complement of implosion
missiles onto the Protector.

1072
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,959
Tear her apart!

1073
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,996
Whoa! He's finished.

1074
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:27,197
Alexander, listen to me.
It's OK, it's OK.

1075
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,953
The Thermians
can handle it from here.

1076
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,148
We need that armour back up!

1077
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:38,677
- Get me a forward view right now!
- Plasma armour engaged.

1078
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:42,150
Tommy, lose 'em in that minefield.

1079
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,834
- Minefield?
- Pedal to the metal!

1080
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,956
- Pedal to the metal!
- Let's go!

1081
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,874
Good going, Tommy. Great going.

1082
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,235
Thrust ahead... full!

1083
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,835
Into the field! Go!

1084
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,796
Can you get us
closer to these mines?

1085
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,199
Closer?

1086
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,032
I could try.

1087
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,112
General, I've lost them.

1088
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:32,512
The magnetism of the minefield
is disrupting our instruments.

1089
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,672
Wait! I see something.

1090
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,917
Yes. Yes! There they are.

1091
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,594
- Get back on their tail.
- I can't, sir.

1092
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,275
- What? Why not?
- Because they're coming right at us.

1093
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,555
Fire at will.

1094
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:55,793
Whoo! We're getting hammered, Jason!
Return fire?

1095
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,553
No! Divert all energy to the armour!

1096
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,710
'How adorable!

1097
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,678
'The actors
are going to play war with me.'

1098
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,356
- Sarris is accelerating toward us.
- Accelerate to mark four.

1099
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,916
Let me remind you, sonny,

1100
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,395
I am a general.

1101
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,358
If you are counting on me to blink,

1102
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,989
then you are making
a deadly mistake.

1103
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,435
Let me tell you something, Sarris.

1104
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,433
It doesn't take a great actor
to recognise a bad one.

1105
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,192
You're sweating!

1106
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,510
Armour almost gone, Jason!

1107
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:40,390
You fool! You failed to realise
that with your armour gone,

1108
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,996
my ship will tear through yours
like tissue paper.

1109
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:49,915
And what you fail to realise
is my ship is dragging mines.

1110
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,833
Oh, no! Turn, turn!

1111
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,756
Yes! Yes!

1112
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,512
Yes!

1113
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,069
Yes! Yes!

1114
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,638
Mathesar!

1115
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,234
Oh, my God, you're alive.

1116
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,313
Come here.

1117
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:36,358
The ship was a model as big as this.

1118
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,514
A very clever deception indeed.

1119
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,597
Set a course for home?

1120
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,558
- Can you do that?
- Just point and click.

1121
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,518
- We'll go through a black hole.
- Objections?

1122
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,396
All right, set her up.

1123
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,317
What's the matter, Mathesar?

1124
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,997
We were hoping
you could come with us.

1125
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:14,117
M- my people have no commander.

1126
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,713
Mathesar, I think your people...
have a great commander.

1127
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,878
Sir.

1128
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,473
Tommy, take us into the black hole.

1129
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,069
- We're out!
- We're going home!

1130
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,230
'Systems functional.'

1131
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,117
All systems are working.

1132
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:58,398
Before we left there was
an energy surge from Sarris' ship.

1133
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:02,439
Let's not worry about that
right now, Alexander... Fred?

1134
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:07,071
Shouldn't you be downstairs? Hey,
you could put an eye out with that.

1135
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,913
Fred?

1136
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,594
Agh!

1137
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,796
No!

1138
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,469
Mathesar!

1139
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,152
Activate the Omega 13!

1140
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,192
- We're out!
- We're going home!

1141
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,395
'Systems functional.'

1142
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,397
All systems are working.

1143
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,758
Before we left there was
an energy surge from Sarris' ship.

1144
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:37,471
Jason, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1145
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:41,308
Let go of me. Let... It's not Fred!

1146
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:45,188
That's Sarris. Listen,
I'm telling you, that's Sarris!

1147
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,475
He's gonna kill all of us!

1148
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,994
Never give up, never surrender.

1149
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,751
Jason! Jason! I can't slow it down!

1150
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:07,960
Our ship cannot enter the atmosphere.
We need to separate, or we'll die.

1151
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,472
We gotta do it.
It's our only hope, Mathesar.

1152
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:19,030
- Thank you.
- Crew to the secondary deck.

1153
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,796
Mathesar!

1154
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,069
Goodbye, my friends.

1155
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,875
Fred, get up to command deck.
We're separating.

1156
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,550
On, Teb, on!

1157
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,229
'The third day of the GalaxyCon,

1158
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:17,279
'and Jason Nesmith and his
entire crew are no-shows here,

1159
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,749
'disappointing all these fans... '

1160
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,833
- Bye. Be back soon!
- Where you taking those fireworks?

1161
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,549
The Protector got super-accelerated
leaving the black hole

1162
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,074
and nailed the atmosphere
at mark 15,

1163
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,833
which is pretty unstable, obviously,

1164
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:36,071
so we're gonna help Laredo
guide it in on the vox

1165
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,435
with these for visual confirmation.

1166
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,114
All right, dinner's at seven.

1167
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,197
- Well, he's outside.
- Hmm.

1168
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,591
Lieutenant Laredo... Tommy Webber!

1169
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,675
Hi, Tommy!

Gwen DeMarco!

1171

Yes!

1172
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:27,989
Yes!

1173
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,514
Wow, what effects!

1174
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,910
Another shipmate!
Yes, the more, the merrier!

1175
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:42,116
The ship's Tech Sergeant Chen,
Fred Kwan... and a friend.

1176

Dr Lazarus... Alexander Dane!

1177
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,388
Give him a big hand. He's British!
Yes, sir!

Jason Nesmith!

1179
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,914
Great driving, Tommy.

1180
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,831
Yeah! Yes!

1181
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,956
Quick, quick! Go, go!

1182
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,480
Mr Jason Nesmith!

1183
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:37,994

the NSEA Protector!

1185
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,236
Wow!

1186
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,391
Come on!

1187
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,515
They're here for you folks. Come on!

1188
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,556
What a show!

1189
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,835
What a show! Yes!

1190
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,754
Yes! Give it up! Wow!

1191
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,429
Come on, give it up!
Give it all up...

1192
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:13,196
for the crew of your favourite show,
Galaxy Quest! Wow!

1193
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,036
Come on, come on!

1194

Don't forget to buy Galaxy Quest
T- shirts on your way out. Thank you.
