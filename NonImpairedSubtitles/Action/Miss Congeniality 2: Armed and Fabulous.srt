1
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,896
Hart, can you get me
Miss Arizona's number?

2
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:24,192
- Why would I do that, Clonsky?
- Because she needs a man in her life.

3
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,494
Yeah? Where do you fit in?

4
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:30,332
- Nice. Nice talk. Not too congenial, Hart.
- Yeah.

5
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,067
It says right here
you're supposed to be real amiable.

6
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:35,939
That's three weeks ago.
I've been amiable since then...

7
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:37,909
...and now I just
wanna hit somebody.

8
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,844
Well, this could be your chance, Hart.

9
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,610
Okay, let's go over this one more time.
The Housewives...

10
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:46,016
...they knocked off nine banks in a month
and wounded two guards.

11
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,523
We got a tip this bank is their next target.
So stay frosty. Keep your heads up.

12
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:55,394
You know you can't wear a swimsuit
on this mission, right, Hart?

13
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,926
That's good.

14
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,502
- What happened to world peace?
- It comes and goes.

15
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:18,752
<i>Control to Big Mama.</i>

16
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:20,822
<i>Check your baby.</i>

17
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:24,283
Hey, honey.

18
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:30,363
- Control, this is Big Mama. Confirm.
- Confirm, Big Mama. Proceed on in.

19
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:36,229
- Big Daddy and Big Mama are inside.
- Copy that.

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,336
I hope we wrap this early.
I have Yankee tickets tonight.

21
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,674
What are you up to?

22
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:47,248
Just basic paperwork, and then
I got company coming over for dinner...

23
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,250
...so I just need to do a little...
A little defrosting.

24
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,754
- Oh, your boyfriend Eric's coming over?
- He's not my boyfriend. Just...

25
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:59,657
we're just friends, you know? Friends
and coworkers. Friendly coworkers.

26
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:03,060
Hey, you ever been to the Poconos?

27
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,799
Where is that? What is that,
New York? Pennsylvania?

28
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,402
You think it'd be hard
to get a reservation there?

29
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:12,905
What, for you and your coworker?

30
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:16,705
- That's so sweet, two agents in love.
- Yeah.

31
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,247
So I guess this is a good time to tell you
that this is not your baby.

32
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:29,988
Housewives, front door. Housewives.

33
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,988
How old?

34
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:37,428
- Thirty-five.
- No, the baby. Can I take a peek?

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,626
No, get lost, lady.
We haven't changed his diaper in a week.

36
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,967
You're that Miss Congeniality lady.

37
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:48,238
No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

38
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:50,902
I saw you on TV
on the Miss United States pageant.

39
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,843
No, ma'am. Ma'am, you did not.

40
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:55,382
- You're Gracie Hart!
- Ma'am, no. Ma'am, please...

41
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,813
- Gracie Hart?
- Gracie Hart?

42
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,147
- Gracie Hart!
- No, I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!

43
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,619
- She's FBI!
- I'm not!

44
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,987
- It's a setup!
- Okay, nobody move! Nobody move!

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,128
Nobody's moving. Ma'am, please be...

46
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:08,457
Please be quiet! Get down!
Nobody's moving.

47
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:11,327
- Get down, please! Please, get down!
- Down, I said. Down!

48
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,197
Nobody's moving. It's okay.
Ma'am, get down! Get down!

49
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,329
We've got a hostage situation.
We need backup. Now!

50
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,606
- We gotta move, ladies!
- Okay. Okay, it's okay.

51
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:23,507
Get your hand out of the purse, Hart.

52
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,780
You too, hubby, get your hands up
where I can see them.

53
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:31,083
Tell me where every other agent is
in this bank.

54
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:37,820
Now.

55
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,027
Now!

56
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,598
There's one in the baby carriage.

57
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,906
- Freeze, FBI!
- FBI, freeze!

58
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,409
Put the gun down!
Put the guns down!

59
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,249
- Take her. Take...
- Got her.

60
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,159
Clonsky, where are you hit?
Where are you hit?

61
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,989
- In the vest. I'm...
- where?

62
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:15,926
I'm all right. I'm all right.

63
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,726
- Oh, my God.
- It hurt like a mother.

64
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,492
I know.

65
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,134
But I got something that's gonna
make you feel a lot better.

66
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:33,442
Here we go, 602-555-0199.

67
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,413
What's that?

68
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:37,551
Miss Arizona's number.

69
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:41,381
- You couldn't tell me earlier?
- No.

70
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,491
- What do we got?
- I'm okay.

71
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,059
Excuse me.

72
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,458
Would you mind?

73
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,808
Hart! Hart!

74
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,472
- Sorry, sir.
- Let's not make a bad day worse.

75
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:08,512
Sir...

76
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:12,176
...about the bank,
I don't know what happened.

77
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:15,756
It was like my high school reunion,
except these people liked me.

78
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,826
Well, I think we can all agree
it didn't go according to plan.

79
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:21,429
But I wanna talk to you
about something else.

80
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:24,395
This is some fan mail we've gotten
for you since the pageant.

81
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:27,593
Letters, cards, chocolates.

82
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,103
I'll take the chocolates.

83
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:33,834
"Dear Miss Hart,
I saw you on the pageant...

84
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,410
...and the next night
I was coming out of a party...

85
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,139
...when this horrible guy
grabbed me in the parking lot.

86
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:43,680
So I did your SING self-defense,
and he totally backed off.

87
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:47,550
I've gone through some tough times lately,
and you have no idea what it means...

88
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:50,692
...to feel like you can stand up
for yourself again.

89
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:55,461
I just wanted to say thank you
and you look beautiful in your e..."

90
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,690
- Evening gown?
- Evening gown.

91
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:00,859
- She liked it?
- Lori, Newark.

92
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:05,038
Sir, you're reading my mail.
That's a class-B misdemeanor.

93
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,645
Hart, I've been getting five calls a day
for you to be on talk shows.

94
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,939
The Bureau's had
some bad publicity lately...

95
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:16,211
...and the director thinks you could be
the new face of the FBI.

96
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:21,651
Sir, I'm just a field agent.

97
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:25,851
Most field agents don't have the president
calling them at home to congratulate them.

98
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,792
I can't believe I hung up on him.
I thought it was Clonsky.

99
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:33,265
This is important, Hart.
Go home, have a nice dinner...

100
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,936
...and think about it.

101
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,466
Well...

102
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:41,269
...I could use a nice dinner, sir.

103
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,210
I'll think about it.

104
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:32,050
Hart.

105
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,229
Well, hello, Agent Matthews.

106
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:40,199
No, I'm just putting the finishing touches
on your chicken potpie. Yeah.

107
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:44,897
I think I'm gonna make some man
very, very happy someday.

108
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:46,905
Listen, I wanna ask you something.

109
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:50,239
Do you know if the Poconos
are in New York or Pennsylvania?

110
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:53,507
Because I cannot seem to get
a clear answer on this.

111
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:56,151
Because I was thinking
that maybe this weekend...

112
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:01,018
...we could take a little drive down there,
do a little exploring, do...

113
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,052
why, aren't...?

114
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:07,729
Why do you wanna talk tomorrow? I mean,
aren't you gonna be here in 10 minutes?

115
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:16,335
Oh, well, I thought we were moving
at kind of a normal speed. I...

116
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:22,341
well, I don't need any more space.
I mean...

117
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:26,572
You know, it's not like I expect us
to get married or anything, but I...

118
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:34,520
well, what is it? I mean, is it...?

119
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:39,421
Is it the way I snort? I mean,
because I don't have to snort.

120
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:42,860
Or is it the...? Is it the sex? Because...

121
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:49,126
You know, I could...
I could get a manual or something.

122
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,210
Well, no.

123
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,181
No, you don't have to explain.

124
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:09,487
No. No, you know what? You know what?
I have to... I have to go.

125
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,654
Don't worry about dinner. I...

126
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:18,027
Mrs. Flammenbaum next door
invited me to a surprise...

127
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,964
...keg party.
You know what? I have to go.

128
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,967
Okay.

129
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,507
Bye.

130
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,173
- This is where the health plan kicks in.
- You ain't kidding.

131
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:20,788
- Morning, sir.
- Hey.

132
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:23,720
I'd really like to talk to you
for a minute, if I could.

133
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:25,724
Hart, have you been crying?

134
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:29,729
No. No. I don't cry.
I don't even have tear ducts.

135
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,470
Sam Fuller. Transferred in
from Chicago last week...

136
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:42,270
...because of
anger-management problems.

137
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:46,006
Really? She seems like
such a people person.

138
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,416
I've been giving this a lot of thought...

139
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:54,318
...and given the fact that going out on ops
has become problematic in light of...

140
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,185
...the bank thing...

141
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:00,954
well, I have decided to become
the new face of the FBI.

142
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,860
I really wanna be there
and support the Bureau...

143
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:08,265
...and be a positive role model for women.
I feel like this is a great ti...

144
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:11,905
Oh, yeah. No way you could've seen me
standing there.

145
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:13,302
- Sorry.
- You were saying?

146
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:15,501
Hey! Yo!

147
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:19,273
- How about a real "sorry", huh?
- Come again?

148
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,245
- You heard me.
- This is gonna be great.

149
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:24,409
I said, how about a real "sorry"?

150
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:27,889
You are about to feel some real pain
if you don't back off.

151
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,584
Hey, you know what? Don't talk to me
about pain, sister. I invented pain.

152
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,421
No, you didn't just call me sister.

153
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:37,760
I don't recall seeing a little, skinny-ass
white girl at the table growing up.

154
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,959
Hey! First of all,
thank you for calling me skinny.

155
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:43,195
Second of all, what is your problem?

156
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:45,806
And third of all,
you better apologize to me or...

157
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:48,375
- Make me!
- You know, I don't make trash. Come on!

158
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:53,311
- Come on.
- Knock it off, Fuller. Take a shower.

159
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:55,450
That's right, take a shower. Walk away.

160
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,950
- You lucky you still can walk!
- You want more?

161
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,611
- Take a shower. Go on.
- Come here.

162
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,957
That's right, go on. Keep walking.

163
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:07,052
Hart.

164
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:10,329
You were saying?

165
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:16,062
Oh, a positive role model for women, sir.

166
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:21,036
I want you to talk to someone
before we schedule any appearances.

167
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,735
Someone who can help
with personal-presentation issues.

168
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:26,746
Clothing, makeup, so forth.
He comes very highly recommended.

169
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,043
I just went through a makeover
for the pageant.

170
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:32,517
I'm still getting hairspray off my butt.

171
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:37,989
What? It prevents the bathing suit
from riding up. Thank you.

172
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,425
Sir, I just don't wanna become
FBI Barbie again.

173
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:42,825
What's your option?

174
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:46,434
You can't go in the field without putting
yourself and agents in jeopardy.

175
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:49,537
- That part of your life is over.
- Sir, it can't be.

176
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,367
That's all that I know how to do.
That's all that I have.

177
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,533
You gotta make a choice.
Sit at a desk pushing papers...

178
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:58,680
...or be out there
boosting the Bureau's image?

179
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:02,609
Look, when you make up your mind,
let me know.

180
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:06,119
Rachel, did those transfer papers
for Matthews come through?

181
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:08,381
On your desk, sir.

182
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:13,461
Sir, is Agent Matthews
going someplace?

183
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,290
Miami.

184
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:21,267
He's gonna be assistant SAC.
Going to the top, that boy.

185
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,331
Sir.

186
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,010
Sorry.

187
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:35,078
You know, I'll meet whoever
you want me to meet.

188
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,945
Good.

189
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,294
Oh, I hope she's not a fatty.

190
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:56,461
Joel Myers, Gracie Hart.

191
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,372
Oh, yes.

192
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:01,207
Yes.

193
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,345
I can work with this.

194
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:06,037
<i>You will be my Mona Lisa,
my Sistine chapel.</i>

195
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,582
- I will find the sculpture in the stone.
- Slow down, da Vinci.

196
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,549
How do you feel about a pushup bra?

197
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,951
How do you feel about
a genital-shocking taser gun?

198
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:17,991
I'm open to it.

199
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,819
Okay.

200
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:24,124
Are you open to new experiences,
like becoming the face of the FBI?

201
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,894
- I did the pageant, I can do this.
- That was three days. This is your life.

202
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,935
That was teaching a dog
a few new tricks.

203
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,539
This is teaching a dog
to become a butterfly.

204
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,939
Not that you're a dog.
They generally have smoother hair.

205
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:41,313
Look, just... You know, just tell me
what you want me to do, and I'll do it.

206
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:44,612
- Rule number one, no hitting.
- What?

207
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:49,349
The face of the FBI uses her words,
not her fists or a chair.

208
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,550
Rule number two,
chew with your mouth closed.

209
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:54,922
- You don't know how I eat.
- You have ketchup stains all over you.

210
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,396
How did they get there
if they didn't fall from an open orifice?

211
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:02,465
I don't know.
Maybe I walked under a ketchup tree.

212
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:06,941
Rule number three, no snorting.

213
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:09,842
Why don't you just take the list.

214
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:19,943
And I truly believe you are capable
of great class and style.

215
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:27,391
And, may I say, I also recently
went through a breakup.

216
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,455
I didn't go through a breakup.

217
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,725
Puffy eyes, no sleep, irritable.

218
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:36,364
And some of the other agents
told me about it.

219
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:40,304
But believe me, you do as I say,
and you will make him regret it...

220
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:45,072
...because people care about people
who care about themselves.

221
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,982
- So it's all in here?
- No, it's all in here.

222
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,386
America wants a star.
So you have to become a star.

223
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,459
You have to dress and treat
your friends like you're a star.

224
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:02,028
You have to treat yourself like a star.
Before you...

225
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:04,026
I know, I know. I'm a big star!

226
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:07,657
Our next guest was the runner-up
at last year's Miss United States pageant.

227
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,297
We found out
she was actually an FBI agent...

228
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:13,839
...on a mission to thwart an attack
on the pageant.

229
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,874
You can read about it
in her new book...

230
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,535
<i>...From Misdemeanors
to Miss Congeniality.</i>

231
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:21,581
Here's Agent Gracie Hart.

232
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:24,983
- Hi, Gracie.
- Regis. Good to see you.

233
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:26,883
- Joy.
- How are you?

234
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:29,751
- What a great suit.
- Thank you, and you look fabulous.

235
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:33,725
- Thank you.
- This is not how I picture an FBI agent.

236
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,121
You don't look anything
like J. Edgar Hoover.

237
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:39,233
Oh, really? Because this is his dress.

238
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:44,066
- Listen, I watched the pageant...
- I bet you did, Regis.

239
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,400
Every year, actually. It's embarrassing.

240
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:49,942
My favorite part was the women's
self-defense thing, you know?

241
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:51,579
Could you give us an encore?

242
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:55,046
Actually, I don't do that anymore.
I have someone who does it for me.

243
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:59,176
So, if I could, I'd like to bring out
a little friend of mine, Agent Sam Fuller...

244
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,948
...who will be helping us
with the demonstration.

245
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,584
Here she is.

246
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:09,194
So, Regis, if we could have you
come over to the mat.

247
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:10,922
Fuller.

248
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,632
Stand right here
with Fuller in front of you.

249
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,497
- All right, Regis, grab her.
- She looks angry.

250
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:22,440
- Do I have to grab her?
- Go ahead. She has no place else to be.

251
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:27,881
All right, ladies, if you'll please remember,
the word is "SING". Solar plexus...

252
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,382
...instep...

253
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:31,780
...nose...

254
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:34,980
...and groin.
- Not the groin! No!

255
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,852
Very nice. Thank you, Agent Fuller.

256
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:42,792
Come on, Regis, let's get you up.

257
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:50,500
Thanks, Gracie. And as a special treat
for knocking my husband around...

258
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:54,130
...I have a little surprise for you.
I think you know these people.

259
00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:00,805
Here's Cheryl Frazier, Miss United States,
and Stan Fields, host of the pageant.

260
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:05,948
It's you!

261
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,549
- I love your lipstick.
- You do? Stila made it for me.

262
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:12,956
- They named it after me. It's called Gracie.
- That makes sense.

263
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,961
- You did something to your hair.
- Just a couple of highlights.

264
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,792
- A couple?
- Okay, okay...

265
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,424
...Miss I'll-Never-Grow-My-Bangs-Out-
Because-It'll-Make-My-Face-Too-Long.

266
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,400
I feel we should all be sitting
under dryers.

267
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:27,041
That's what happens
when best friends get together.

268
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:30,711
Wish we could have invited my best friend,
Roger Coleman...

269
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:33,814
...but he got hit
by a Goodwill truck last week.

270
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:35,976
Really?

271
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,479
Don't we have a commercial coming up?
Please.

272
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,089
- It's so good to see you.
- It's so good to see you. I...

273
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:48,821
Gracie, I'm sorry to interrupt.
We have another taping.

274
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,488
Oh, Cheryl, Joel Myers, my stylist.

275
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,660
Miss United States, such a joy to meet you.
This is my hair assistant, Janine.

276
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,067
- A pleasure.
- And on makeup and bass guitar, Pam.

277
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,970
- Your Majesty.
- And you're having a bad crown day.

278
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,441
Excuse me, private conversation
in progress.

279
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,074
- Ticktock.
- Okay.

280
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:09,045
I'm sorry I haven't called in a while.

281
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:12,846
Don't apologize. We'll have plenty of time
to talk once I'm de-queened.

282
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:17,685
- Oh, that sounds painful.
- Oh, I really miss you.

283
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,827
- And Eric.
- Oh, well...

284
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:22,361
...actually Eric and I
aren't Eric and I anymore.

285
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:27,332
- What? Since when?
- Oh, just 10 months.

286
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:30,471
- Ten months?
- Yeah, I didn't wanna bother you.

287
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:34,507
You're busy, I'm busy. I didn't wanna call
and say, "we broke up". It's no big deal.

288
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:37,611
Miss Hart? My daughter
would love your John Hancock.

289
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:38,939
- What's her name?
- Lauren.

290
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,172
Lauren.

291
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,349
So, what happened?

292
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:46,681
Oh, I just had to end it because
he was getting, you know, really clingy.

293
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,515
Yeah, but I'm fine. I'm good. I'm great.

294
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:54,491
<i>We need to get to Live at 5
for a wrestling demonstration...</i>

295
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,655
...then there's a cocktail party
at your publisher's apartment.

296
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,767
I could go for a little tanning time.

297
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:03,098
You're gonna go for a little unemployment
time in about two seconds.

298
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:05,796
Could you be a sweetheart
and get me a Starbucks?

299
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:08,704
I am dying for an iced
Venti Caramel Macchiato.

300
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:10,538
Get yourself a little something too.

301
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:16,083
Let me tell you when I'm gonna get you
an iced Venti Caramel Macchiato.

302
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:21,086
When they elect a black woman president of
the Daughters of the American Revolution.

303
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,026
Okay. And if that happens,
I'd also like one of those little muffins.

304
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,028
Where would you like it?

305
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:33,259
Fuller, I'm sensing a little subtle hostility,
and I think we should talk about it.

306
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:36,167
Fuller, you shouldn't keep things
bottled up.

307
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:40,775
- Fuller! What is your problem?
- The problem is, I don't like you.

308
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,139
Why don't you quit. I let you have this job
as a favor to McDonald...

309
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:47,372
...because no one outside of the canine unit
would work with you...

310
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:51,110
...because of your little attitude problem.
- You know what? I'm out of here.

311
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,846
Wait. Are you still going to Starbucks?

312
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,561
Go!

313
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:20,609
No one beats my little bro!
Let's go, let's go, pay up.

314
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,977
Come on, pay up.
Come on, who's next?

315
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,182
Let's get the bets on the table because...

316
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,952
- Yeah?
- Is he there?

317
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,522
- Yeah, he's here.
- Well, has he got my money?

318
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:38,559
Hold on, I'll ask.

319
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:46,237
Excuse me, Highlander, you owe
Mr. Grant 500 bucks. You got it?

320
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:48,171
Get lost.

321
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:51,277
He says he doesn't have it, Mr. Grant.

322
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:55,675
Okay! Okay!

323
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,217
He seems to have discovered
some cash, Mr. Grant.

324
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,583
Good. All right,
I got another one for you boys.

325
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,187
Who's the mark?

326
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,589
This is gonna be one for your scrapbook.

327
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,361
- Thank you very much. Your name, please?
- Octavia.

328
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,662
I was wondering if you could tell me
what skin-care regimen you use.

329
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:18,067
Well, I like to catch as many felons
as possible.

330
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,939
It really gets the heart pumping, and the
increased circulation helps my complexion.

331
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,272
- There you go. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

332
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:27,039
- Hey.
- Hey. Your name, please?

333
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,615
- Priscilla.
- Priscilla.

334
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:31,479
I have to do a book report.

335
00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:34,622
And I wanna do it on your book
because I wanna be an agent too.

336
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:37,690
Oh, well, good for you.
Thank you, Priscilla.

337
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:39,952
- Hi. Your name is?
- Angela.

338
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:43,757
The other kids are doing their report
on Beyoncé or Britney...

339
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:47,868
...but if you come to my school and talk,
they'd see why being an agent is so cool...

340
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:50,630
...and stop getting on me.
- I would really love to...

341
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:53,706
...but as you can see,
the agency's got me pretty busy.

342
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,103
There you go. Thank you.

343
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:59,475
What you could do is pull your hair up once
in a while. It would open up your face...

344
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:04,085
...because remember, people care about
people who care about themselves.

345
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,414
- Okay.
- Hi. Your name is?

346
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,816
- Jason.
- Jason.

347
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:12,585
If you change your mind, it's P.S. 31,
Priscilla, Miss Gordan's class.

348
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,991
Got it. Thank you very much.
Your name, please?

349
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:16,562
- James.
- Wait!

350
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:18,528
You're not writing it down!

351
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,533
Bureau training. I can retain
enormous amounts of information.

352
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:25,639
P.S. 31, Priscilla,
Miss Gordan's class. See?

353
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:30,008
And don't forget the hair tip.
Try some bows.

354
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:35,945
- There you go. Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

355
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,211
And sorry to hear what happened
to Miss United States.

356
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,151
What happened?

357
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:48,262
<i>Cheryl Frazier was last seen outside
this Las Vegas senior-citizen home...</i>

358
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,297
<i>...accompanied by longtime pageant host,
Stan Fields.</i>

359
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,128
<i>The two were walking to a limo
after a goodwill mission...</i>

360
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,894
<i>...visiting the residents here.</i>

361
00:25:56,071 --> 00:26:00,201
<i>Apparently, Miss United States
and emcee Fields were forced into a truck...</i>

362
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,173
Are they hurt? Are they alive?
What demands have been made?

363
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:06,280
That's all we know. You'll find out more
when you get to Vegas.

364
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,814
The director wants you
to handle publicity on this.

365
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,111
Public sees you on TV,
they'll feel reassured.

366
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,049
Absolutely, whatever I can do to help.

367
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:16,315
Get your beauty team assembled
immediately. The jet leaves at 0800.

368
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,892
I want you to have a bodyguard out
of New York. They're strapped in Vegas.

369
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,757
- Sir, why do I need a bodyguard?
- Crowd control.

370
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:25,695
You're gonna be
the hottest celebrity in Vegas.

371
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:29,997
- Assuming Wayne Newton isn't in town.
- Oh, of course, sir. "Danke Schoen".

372
00:26:35,577 --> 00:26:39,069
Fuller! I want you on a plane
to Vegas with Hart.

373
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:42,114
She's gonna do publicity
on the Cheryl Frazier kidnapping.

374
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:44,084
Not going.

375
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:49,617
- Did you just refuse an order?
- I can't take her, sir.

376
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:52,123
I'll kill her. And I'll enjoy it.

377
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:54,990
Fuller, you are this close to being gone.

378
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,994
Nobody wants to work with you
in Chicago or here.

379
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,191
That's fine by me. I like to work alone.

380
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,600
Then become a lighthouse keeper.
This is the FBI. We like partners.

381
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:07,071
She's a pain in the ass.
She's conceited and...

382
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:11,679
Keep people off her. Keep her safe. You
be a good bodyguard, I'll find you a partner.

383
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:15,907
You blow this, you're gone. Period.

384
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:19,078
<i>And by the way,
I loved you both on Regis.</i>

385
00:27:46,715 --> 00:27:47,943
- Grant.
- Boys.

386
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:49,344
Mr. Grant.

387
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,178
Let's see what you got for me.

388
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:55,380
- Stan Fields and...
- Miss United States.

389
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,223
You know what the pageant
will pay to get her back? Millions.

390
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:02,625
- So you're saying we hold her for ransom?
- No.

391
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:05,891
I hold her for ransom,
and you get a taste.

392
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:08,194
Bring her to my car.

393
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,400
I'm a little bit hungry.

394
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,005
Hey! We grabbed her.

395
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:19,613
Moron, you can't handle this job.
The feds will come right down on you.

396
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:24,411
Don't call me a moron. I got a BA
in Fine Arts, and my brother...

397
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:28,086
- Don't call me a moron.
- You were unemployed when I found you.

398
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:30,622
You couldn't keep a job
on the show in the Strip.

399
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,317
I made that show! It was my concept.

400
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:37,295
Then suddenly they change it and tell me
and Lou we're not up to their standards.

401
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,693
You work for me now.

402
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:42,832
- Lou.
- I'm there.

403
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,708
Bring me back up!

404
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:03,286
She's yours! She's all yours!
Let me up! Let me up.

405
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:07,253
Just let me up.
Oh, God, let me up.

406
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:10,888
Next time, he lets go.

407
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:13,394
You guys are crazy!

408
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,133
Now what?

409
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,302
Now we do exactly what he said.
We ransom her.

410
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,696
Please be careful.
My guns are in that Fendi.

411
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,894
Thank you. Thank you.

412
00:29:57,645 --> 00:30:00,409
Please tell me you have tickets
to see Cirque du Soleil.

413
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:03,715
- I'm your bodyguard.
- What?

414
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,582
<i>McDonald thinks we have a bond
because of our performance on Regis...</i>

415
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:11,555
<i>...and TRL, Oprah, the Food Network.</i>

416
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:16,595
Oh, hey, hey, we got some great recipes
from that one. The lemon chicken? Tangy.

417
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:22,465
Now, look, like all great teams,
Hope and Crosby, Fred and Ginger...

418
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:24,229
...Outkast...

419
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,202
...the end must come...

420
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:28,569
...so bye-bye.

421
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:36,409
Let me make this simple for you, Hart.
McDonald gave me a mission...

422
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:41,378
...so that plane does not take off
unless we're both on it. Got it?

423
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,657
You might consider a Tic Tac.

424
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:23,130
Please...

425
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,096
...we're trying to cooperate.

426
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:29,065
- Shut your mouth.
- You can't talk to her like that.

427
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:31,933
- You trying to tell me what to do?
- No, I'm just the emcee.

428
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:35,769
I've heard you sing.
Lucky I don't shoot you now.

429
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:38,344
Okay, let's line this up.

430
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:44,550
- And...
- I don't have my crown.

431
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,416
- Who cares?
- I care.

432
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:48,886
- Fine.
- Thousands of women...

433
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:51,321
...all across America care.
- Give her the crown.

434
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:55,929
When in public, Miss United States
always proudly wears her crown.

435
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:57,826
Okay?

436
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,528
All right, let's go again.

437
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:05,372
One, two, action.

438
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,509
We've been kidnapped,
and there's two men here...

439
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,009
...who say they're gonna kill us
by Friday at midnight.

440
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,307
But I don't want anyone
to pay them any money.

441
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:17,417
- Cut!
- That would be giving in to terrorism...

442
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:19,416
...and I'm Miss United States...

443
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:22,886
- cut!
... and I stand for fairness and decency...

444
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:24,888
...and the American way!

445
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,825
I said, cut!

446
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:34,701
I'd be happy to say it if you'd like.

447
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,928
I've done quite a bit of theater.

448
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:41,201
<i>I played lago in Twelfth Night.</i>

449
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:29,153
Put two more choppers up.

450
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:31,055
Sir.

451
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:38,559
- Gracie Hart.
- Yes.

452
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,563
- I'm Walter Collins.
- Sir.

453
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,264
I feel as though
I'm in the presence of royalty.

454
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,930
Oh, no, sir, I'm not queen,
just runner-up.

455
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,343
I would like to present to you
Agent Sam Fuller.

456
00:33:50,812 --> 00:33:52,211
- Fuller.
- Sir.

457
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,215
- Joel Myers, Janine and Pam.
- Joel, Janine, Pam.

458
00:33:57,385 --> 00:34:01,185
Why don't we get you to the hotel
while I give the agents a debriefing.

459
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:05,287
Oh, that's too bad. It's been months
since I've had a good debriefing.

460
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,759
Although, I'm really more
of a boxers man.

461
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:17,135
Okay, wrong audience.

462
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:25,974
Agent Hart, Agent Fuller,
this is Agent Foreman. He's your liaison.

463
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,138
- You need anything, Jeff is your boy.
- Good.

464
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,749
Welcome to Las Vegas

465
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:33,751
when my girlfriend found out that I would
be working with you, she almost died.

466
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,445
Yeah, she's an agent too.

467
00:34:35,623 --> 00:34:38,217
She actually thought
that I was gonna fall for you.

468
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:43,125
- I told her... I said, "Janet, there's no way..."
- Foreman, we talked about this.

469
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:48,530
Sorry, sir. Anyway, you're obviously
too old for me, so...

470
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:52,733
Oh, good, well, that's a load off.

471
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:58,008
Frazier and Fields make an appearance
at a senior center for a program...

472
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:02,775
...where the elderly spend time with kids.
Mr. Fields' mother is there.

473
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,508
<i>I think what you're doing here...</i>

474
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:08,815
<i>...shows that different generations
have so much to learn from each other.</i>

475
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,756
<i>I mean, I know I learned a lot
from my grandmother...</i>

476
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,919
<i>...specifically, how to kill a chicken.</i>

477
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:20,090
<i>And even though it wasn't something
I enjoyed doing...</i>

478
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:23,203
<i>...I'll never forget the sound
of their death squawks.</i>

479
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:27,603
<i>But if I had to kill a chicken,
I'd know how.</i>

480
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:29,408
They finish their appearance.

481
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:32,205
Head for the limo,
where they're attacked and kidnapped.

482
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,644
We got this video
from a surveillance camera.

483
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:40,384
All we have is two hooded figures, the
make of the truck and a fake license plate.

484
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:45,219
We talked to the limo driver, but he says
he didn't see anything. And that's it.

485
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:48,018
These are your briefing folders.

486
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:53,090
Hart, you have a press conference
at your hotel at 0900 tomorrow morning.

487
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:55,235
- Call me if there's any questions.
- Sir?

488
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,928
- We have to find her.
- I'll find her.

489
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:16,418
I know we're on a tight schedule...

490
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,425
...but if you guys wanna see any shows,
just let me know. Janet can get us tickets.

491
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,155
I don't know how she does it,
but she does it.

492
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:28,194
She's really great.
Expert marksman. She bakes.

493
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:32,271
Oh, almost forgot.
Here are your coded ID cards.

494
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,672
You're gonna need these to get into
the Bureau. And here are your earpieces.

495
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:38,402
We're... Thanks.

496
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:42,106
We're gonna be on frequency 1145.

497
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:46,053
Sorry, that is not FBI issue.

498
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,950
That's a sweater that I bought for Janet
for her birthday.

499
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:53,787
And that's the hat that goes with it.
Argyle. She's Scottish.

500
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:56,459
Janet McCarran.

501
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,259
Look, I'm sorry. I'm just really in love.

502
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,769
Where's the best place
for me to throw up?

503
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:04,766
Well, I am thrilled for you, Jeff.

504
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:09,838
Because, unlike Agent Fuller,
I, too, am carbon-based.

505
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:25,782
The Venetian Hotel.

506
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:34,166
Miss Hart!

507
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:40,869
What a fantastic pleasure. I am Roberto
Fenice, manager of the Venetian Hotel.

508
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:44,739
- Oh, hello.
- Your wish is my command.

509
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:48,541
Oh, well, I wish you wouldn't kiss
my watch. It's not water-resistant.

510
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:51,913
Although it's more action
than I've had in months, so go ahead.

511
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:54,987
- Miss Hart, you are delicious.
- Mr. Fenice.

512
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:57,647
Hi, I'm Agent Foreman.
This is Agent Sam Fuller.

513
00:37:57,825 --> 00:38:02,159
- Oh, my gosh! It's Gracie Hart!
- You're kidding!

514
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,661
- Where?
- Right there!

515
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:05,423
Gracie!

516
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,567
Gracie! Hey! Grac...

517
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,191
Fuller!

518
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,929
- Oh, my!
- Fuller!

519
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,269
All right, down! Down!

520
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:16,535
Too much, too much, too much.
Fuller, Fuller.

521
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:21,614
Fuller, I don't think you fully understand
the concept of "too much"!

522
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:25,411
Hey, McDonald told me
to keep people off you.

523
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:30,182
And I don't think grandpa's coming back.
At least, not under his own power.

524
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:37,488
Maybe we should've stayed
at Treasure Island, huh?

525
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,293
- You don't see that in Jersey.
- It's the best.

526
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:44,529
A ships sinks, and there's all
these scantily clad sailors around.

527
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:48,266
- Makes me wanna join the Navy.
- Yeah, you are just what they're looking for.

528
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:51,309
Hey, Hart, you sure this suite
is big enough for you?

529
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:54,471
I can fit my entire room
inside your steam shower.

530
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:56,548
Feel free to move in there.

531
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:59,948
Yeah, right. Right, let's go over
this schedule for tomorrow.

532
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,679
- Gracie?
- Yes.

533
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:04,757
Gracie, there's something
about Cheryl on the TV.

534
00:39:07,628 --> 00:39:10,529
<i>We just received what appears to be
a ransom video...</i>

535
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:14,862
<i>...which was e-mailed to our studios
a few hours ago from an anonymous source.</i>

536
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:18,130
<i>It was sent from an unknown location.</i>

537
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:21,900
<i>We've been kidnapped.
And there's two men here...</i>

538
00:39:22,076 --> 00:39:26,308
<i>...who say they're going to kill us
by Friday at midnight...</i>

539
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:31,083
<i>...unless they're paid $5 million
by the pageant.</i>

540
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:36,550
<i>Once again, that's $5 million
by Friday at midnight.</i>

541
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:39,887
I can't just sit here. I have to do something.
I should just see...

542
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:42,757
You should do exactly
what you came here to do, Hart.

543
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,232
Press conference at 9.

544
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:43,314
Limos.

545
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:46,488
Limos, limos, limos.

546
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:10,615
- Call for you, sir. Line two.
- Thank you.

547
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:17,316
- Collins.
- Yes, sir, hi, this is Gracie Hart.

548
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:20,426
I was looking at the visuals,
and I noticed that the limousine...

549
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:23,085
- we talked to the limo driver.
- I realize that, but...

550
00:41:23,264 --> 00:41:25,732
- we've got something on aerial.
- Don't worry about it.

551
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,891
Get some rest.
Have a nice press conference.

552
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:31,571
Okay.

553
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,471
Thank you, Janet.

554
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,947
Yeah, hi, is this Desert Limo Service?

555
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:43,743
Yeah, I'm trying to locate
one of your drivers.

556
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,749
A Mr. Tom Abernathy.

557
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:12,239
Hi, is Gracie Hart there, please?
I have FBI Director Wilson on the line.

558
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:14,313
We need to speak with her ASAP, please.

559
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:19,082
Is Gracie Hart here? Gracie Hart?

560
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:23,383
- Is somebody calling for Gracie Hart?
- Yes, ma'am.

561
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:25,718
I'm Gracie Hart.

562
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,155
- I recognize her! Gracie Hart's here!
- Yes?

563
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:33,528
- It's FBI Director Wilson, ASAP. ASAP.
- Director Wilson. Thank you. Hart here.

564
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:36,433
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

565
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:39,100
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

566
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:42,240
Thank you very much.
Okay, sir, bye-bye.

567
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:44,604
- Would you please sign this?
- Oh, sure, I...

568
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:46,803
My mom loves you.

569
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,973
- And she does not love easily.
- I love you too, Gracie.

570
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,084
- You're fabulous.
- You've got such great...

571
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:55,745
Thank you, guys, so much
for your support.

572
00:42:55,923 --> 00:43:00,622
I'm here on business to talk to this man
about the Miss United States kidnapping.

573
00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:02,318
- Mr. Abernathy?
- Yeah?

574
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,327
What did you do?

575
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:08,525
He was driving the limousine
that Cheryl Frazier and Stan Fields were in...

576
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:10,192
...the day they were kidnapped.

577
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:13,966
I wanted to know why you parked so far
away from the entrance of the home.

578
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:16,166
Yeah, why would you do that? Why?

579
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,141
So if I could show you something...

580
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:25,081
well, it's not these. It's not my badge.
Well, what do you...?

581
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:28,481
It's my deployment schedule...

582
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:33,184
...and if you can look where it says
"tomorrow's events".

583
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:37,119
- Yeah, go ahead, read aloud.
- "Nine a.m. Press conference...

584
00:43:37,298 --> 00:43:41,496
...at the Venetian"?
- Speak up, we cannot hear you!

585
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:44,331
He said, "9 a.m. Press conference
at the Venetian"...

586
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:47,030
...where I will be in front
of channels two, four...

587
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,107
I mean, well, everybody's invited.

588
00:43:49,276 --> 00:43:52,768
And I will probably have to say
that Tom Abernathy is a suspect.

589
00:43:52,946 --> 00:43:55,141
Why are you doing this to me?

590
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:57,216
Because I wanna find my friends.

591
00:43:57,518 --> 00:44:00,612
And because you are sweating
in all three stress spots...

592
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:05,748
...that people routinely start sweating in
before they undergo public humiliation.

593
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,091
<i>I had it on Letterman.</i>

594
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:11,597
Okay, everybody,
I would love to stay and chat...

595
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:14,791
...but I have to go pick out my outfit
for the press conference.

596
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:17,368
- Oh, what time was that again?
- Nine!

597
00:44:17,538 --> 00:44:20,871
Thank you. Watch the news,
I'll do a little shout out.

598
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:22,474
Thanks, Gracie.

599
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:27,410
Hey! Hey! Hold up! Hold up. Wait.

600
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:33,952
Okay. Somebody came up to me
the day before.

601
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:38,455
She offers me 200 bucks if I will park
far away from the entrance at the home...

602
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:42,891
...and that's it. That's all I know, I swear.
- She? What did she look like?

603
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:51,671
- Oh, Miss Hart, would you mind?
- Oh, I'm actually in a hurry.

604
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,501
- Is it true you're seeing Prince William?
- Oh, I'm...

605
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:58,577
No, we were just talking at a book party.
He's in love with me, but I hate castles.

606
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:03,573
- Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hey.
- Let me explain something to you.

607
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:07,084
You didn't do what was on the schedule,
and I'm a schedule-type person.

608
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:09,119
You missed the press conference.

609
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,258
I went to the Bureau because
I got a tip from the limo driver...

610
00:45:12,426 --> 00:45:15,020
...who said that somebody
who looked like Dolly Parton...

611
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:17,595
...paid him not to park
in front of the senior home.

612
00:45:17,765 --> 00:45:19,665
- Did you hear what you just said?
- Yeah.

613
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:22,165
And why did you go out
without clearing it with me?

614
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:24,930
Clearing it with you?

615
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,239
Hey, I'll bet no one's had breakfast...

616
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:30,707
I'm sorry, but I don't work for you.
Okay? You work for me, so...

617
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:35,008
- No, you didn't just say I work for you.
- You work for me.

618
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,173
- You work for me.
- Shut up.

619
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:38,682
- You work for me.
- Shut up.

620
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:41,616
Fuller, I don't have the time
for this, okay?

621
00:45:41,789 --> 00:45:43,882
Listen, why don't we just get something...

622
00:45:44,057 --> 00:45:46,821
Okay, look. I am the face of the Bureau.

623
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:51,556
You are here to help me be the face of the
Bureau, which means that you work for me.

624
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:52,960
It's no big...

625
00:45:55,969 --> 00:46:00,565
Look, Hart, I am your bodyguard.
That means I need a body to guard!

626
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:05,502
You hit me, which means
I could bring you up on charges.

627
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,809
If I could just bring myself up
right now.

628
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,414
Okay, look, I don't work for you.
You don't work for me.

629
00:46:14,588 --> 00:46:19,719
We're a team. Get it? As in "I will kick your
sorry ass if you don't listen to me" team.

630
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:22,157
If you remember correctly,
it was "skinny ass".

631
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:25,594
And, second of all,
what is your problem, Fuller?

632
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:30,563
Do you honestly feel it's okay to go around
harassing people and bashing their faces in?

633
00:46:30,737 --> 00:46:33,331
Guess what.
You will never make it in this Bureau...

634
00:46:33,507 --> 00:46:36,533
...if you don't start using your head.
You just use...

635
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:39,942
what, you start listening to me now?

636
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,776
Stop it! Stop! Stop!

637
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,613
All right.

638
00:46:46,787 --> 00:46:52,419
Fuller, violence is not the answer
to our problems, all right? It's not.

639
00:46:52,593 --> 00:46:55,653
And I'm not just saying that
because I'm "scared" of you. Okay?

640
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:58,389
Because I'm... what is that?!

641
00:47:03,136 --> 00:47:06,537
I am calling McDonald. Where's Joel?
I can't go into public like this.

642
00:47:06,707 --> 00:47:08,402
Hey, how are you? Joel!

643
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,135
- Hello.
- You knocked my highlights off.

644
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:12,710
- What happened?
- Look!

645
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,905
- This will take an hour.
- Tell me about it.

646
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,344
- Misting.
- Ladies.

647
00:47:16,517 --> 00:47:20,146
I really think we should call the networks
and set up another press conference.

648
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,845
You know what?
You're absolutely right. Okay.

649
00:47:23,023 --> 00:47:27,585
I'm gonna go back up to the room.
I'm gonna get a little spritz, a little refresh...

650
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:35,158
It's her. It's her. Hold this.

651
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:39,264
- We are not questioning Dolly.
- It's not the real Dolly, so relax.

652
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,600
I know it's not. Stay away from her.

653
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,743
Okay, I'm an adult.
I can act as I please.

654
00:47:43,911 --> 00:47:46,744
- You leave Dolly alone!
- Get your hands off me!

655
00:47:46,914 --> 00:47:51,146
Thank you very much.
Excuse me, fake Dolly!

656
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:53,411
Hi. Hello. FBI here.

657
00:47:53,587 --> 00:47:57,250
Yeah, I just would love to have
a few words with you if I could.

658
00:47:57,424 --> 00:47:59,016
- Hi, how are you?
- How you doing?

659
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:03,492
Yeah, thank you for your support.
Yeah. Get off me, you stalker! Get off me!

660
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:05,597
Fake Dolly!

661
00:48:05,766 --> 00:48:07,427
Where are you going?

662
00:48:10,003 --> 00:48:11,231
Hart!

663
00:48:13,373 --> 00:48:14,670
- Fake Dolly!
- Gracie!

664
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:16,172
- Stop!
- Hart, stop!

665
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,009
Dolly Parton!

666
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:22,979
What is it about this outfit that is making
everyone so uncooperative?

667
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,447
Gracie Hart!

668
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:31,351
Blondie! No pictures. Hold on.

669
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:32,890
Excuse me. I need for you to...

670
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,990
- Open! Just...
- watch it!

671
00:48:37,698 --> 00:48:40,565
- Someone stop that fake Dolly!
- Hart, stop!

672
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:43,866
Stop her!

673
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:45,532
Excuse me. Excuse me.

674
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,403
Please don't make me do something
that's not ladylike.

675
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:00,984
Okay, FBI. I have just a few questions
for you.

676
00:49:01,154 --> 00:49:04,715
Me first! What is the matter with you?

677
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:06,825
Miss Hart! What are you doing?

678
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:10,395
Miss Parton is here for a press conference
to announce her new world tour.

679
00:49:10,564 --> 00:49:13,192
There is no world tour,
and this is not Dolly Parton.

680
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,200
Okay, look. Look, these are absolutely...

681
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,806
what are you...? What is she doing?
That hurts!

682
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,274
- Why did you run?
- Some crazy woman was chasing me!

683
00:49:25,012 --> 00:49:29,039
Excuse me, excuse me. Miss Parton, "Here
You come Again" was my wedding song.

684
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,776
- I just love you.
- Honey, let's leave Miss Parton alone.

685
00:49:31,952 --> 00:49:34,750
I love that song too.
That was an amazing song!

686
00:49:34,921 --> 00:49:37,048
Why are you on top of me?

687
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,186
I'm just a big fan.

688
00:49:41,928 --> 00:49:44,123
It's also on CNN...

689
00:49:44,297 --> 00:49:46,697
...MSNBC...

690
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:49,161
...and Al Jazeera.

691
00:49:49,336 --> 00:49:53,397
- I was trying to question her regarding...
- You really think you're something special.

692
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,406
I have got 75 people
working on this case day and night...

693
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,477
...and they don't stack up to you, do they?
- The limo driver...

694
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:02,740
I want you off this case.

695
00:50:03,116 --> 00:50:08,554
Well, I am sorry, sir, but you don't have
the authority to kick me off this case.

696
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:14,850
I could call the director,
who happens to be a close, personal friend.

697
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:20,762
Or I could even call the president,
who invited me to dinner at his house.

698
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:25,969
And I think we know which house
I'm talking about, don't we? It's white.

699
00:50:26,139 --> 00:50:27,697
Actually, it's eggshell, if you...

700
00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:32,334
I am the SAC in Las Vegas.
I have authority over my territory.

701
00:50:32,512 --> 00:50:35,413
And when the director sees you
on national television...

702
00:50:35,582 --> 00:50:39,416
...nose-tackling his favorite country-western
singer, he will back me up.

703
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:43,189
Now, I want the two of you
on a jet back to New York today.

704
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:46,951
Do you think you can handle
that tiny, little task, Foreman?

705
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,488
Of course, sir.

706
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:56,893
Okay. I got you the last three seats
on the flight.

707
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:59,470
Janine, Pam, you have to take
the next one. Sorry.

708
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,707
- Because we're just hair and makeup?
- We could go to the bar.

709
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:05,344
For five hours?

710
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:07,002
Okay.

711
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:15,277
The director's gonna call me back
any minute.

712
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:16,786
Good. And when he does...

713
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:20,358
...you can let him know that chasing Dolly
was all your dumb idea.

714
00:51:20,527 --> 00:51:23,724
Oh, really? Well, let me ask you something,
chatty Cathy.

715
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:27,492
What happened to, "Team, yo.
You and me in it together"?

716
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,103
Don't do that again.
And that was before you ruined my career.

717
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:32,499
- What?
- Yeah.

718
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:36,938
McDonald said that if I screwed this up,
then I'm out of the Bureau. Thanks, Hart.

719
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:39,442
What are you complaining about?
You're not famous.

720
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:42,138
Nobody knows who you are.
You're a private failure.

721
00:51:42,315 --> 00:51:45,842
But you see this? You see this?
Everybody knows this.

722
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,419
So if I screw up, I'm failure face.

723
00:51:48,588 --> 00:51:51,386
Well, get your failure face
out of my ruined-career face...

724
00:51:51,558 --> 00:51:54,857
...because right now I'm mad,
and I'm pissed off and mad, so...

725
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,189
Oh, okay, hold on.
So you're double mad?

726
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:01,232
Well, if you're double mad, then I am
mad, mad, mad. All right? Top that one.

727
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:03,335
- Back off!
- You gotta stop hitting me...

728
00:52:03,503 --> 00:52:05,437
...because every time you do,
it wrinkles!

729
00:52:05,605 --> 00:52:07,573
Ladies, ladies!

730
00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:12,474
Calm down. Sit down. Sit down.
I'm gonna separate the two of you.

731
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:15,179
Mad, mad, mad, mad. Four.

732
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,683
I can still shoot her from here.

733
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:19,614
You have to lean over me
to get to her.

734
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:23,916
Now, let's calm down and try to focus
on the positive. We have our health.

735
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,526
- You'll be getting frequent-flyer miles.
- Foreman, what did you just say?

736
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:30,557
Frequent-flyer miles.
It's a great way to get upgrades.

737
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,357
No, you said that she...

738
00:52:35,368 --> 00:52:39,998
You said that she would have
to lean over you to get to me.

739
00:52:43,543 --> 00:52:46,512
Look at what the kidnappers are doing.

740
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,611
This guy is leaning over Cheryl
to get to Stan.

741
00:52:50,784 --> 00:52:53,844
Why would they do that
if they were after Cheryl?

742
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,647
Okay, and look at this. Look at this.
They're not even touching her.

743
00:52:57,824 --> 00:53:02,557
No, she's just stuck in there,
like a little Cheryl sandwich. She's... She's...

744
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:07,132
Oh, my God. She is grabbing them.
I taught her that wristlock.

745
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,930
- She's not defending herself. She's...
- She's defending Stan.

746
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:16,007
Maybe they weren't after Cheryl.
Maybe they were after Stan.

747
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:18,811
The man can't sing,
but is that a crime?

748
00:53:18,979 --> 00:53:21,914
- That's what we're gonna find out.
- Hey, look, they're boarding.

749
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:23,947
- Let it go, Hart.
- Oh, Fuller, come on.

750
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:27,814
Wake up and smell the iced Venti Caramel
Macchiato. You know I'm onto something.

751
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:31,321
- Okay. Tell Collins.
- We have issues. He won't listen to me.

752
00:53:31,491 --> 00:53:34,892
- And you think I am?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

753
00:53:35,061 --> 00:53:39,691
You know, you don't get your miles unless
you're actually on the flight, so come on.

754
00:53:40,267 --> 00:53:42,599
- You're on your own, Hart.
- No, I'm not.

755
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:46,603
Because even though you refuse to dress up
or separate those eyebrows...

756
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:48,832
...you cannot deny that you have a style.

757
00:53:49,576 --> 00:53:55,208
Gray suit, white shirt, masculine shoes.
You are an FBI agent.

758
00:53:55,382 --> 00:53:57,350
And that is all that you have.

759
00:53:57,517 --> 00:54:02,955
And like you said, if you go back there now,
you are out of the Bureau.

760
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:07,355
<i>Now boarding all rows
on flight 624 to New York.</i>

761
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,519
Fuller, I am begging you.

762
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:14,033
Do you have any idea
how painful this is for me?

763
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,260
Usually, they give an epidural
for this kind of agony.

764
00:54:17,904 --> 00:54:22,932
Fuller, please, just... Just, please.

765
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,575
Hart, you better be right, or I swear...

766
00:54:29,749 --> 00:54:33,185
You're gonna kick my skinny white ass
and break my face. I know.

767
00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:38,721
I already paid for the seats, and I don't
get reimbursed unless you're on the flight.

768
00:54:45,298 --> 00:54:48,426
I'm letting you spend the night
because I wanna keep my eyes on you.

769
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:52,002
- Tomorrow, you guys are on a flight.
- Okay, as soon as we go to the home.

770
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:54,265
- Whose home?
- Where Stan Fields' mother lives.

771
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:57,274
She was the last person to see him.
Maybe she knows something.

772
00:54:57,444 --> 00:55:01,540
You're supposed to be in New York. You're
famous. Everyone there will recognize you.

773
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:05,207
Not to worry. Joel will come up
with something to make us blend.

774
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,513
- He's a born blender.
- I don't believe this.

775
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,820
You guys are lucky
that Janet had to work late...

776
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:15,587
...because if she was here,
she would not put up with any of this.

777
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:19,561
Now, Janet... Janet runs a tight ship.

778
00:55:22,168 --> 00:55:27,800
I love shopping in Vegas. Where else can
you find a 24-hour wiggery? Well, to work.

779
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,336
Hey, hey! That's my room! Hey!

780
00:55:32,779 --> 00:55:33,768
Hey!

781
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:45,455
- I never would have suspected.
- What?

782
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:48,685
You as a dainty-travel-pillow type.

783
00:55:48,862 --> 00:55:51,422
- It's hypoallergenic.
- Oh, really?

784
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,863
- And what are you allergic to?
- Besides you?

785
00:55:55,035 --> 00:56:00,098
Shellfish, cats, dogs,
any type of animal dander...

786
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,831
...dairy products, dust...

787
00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:05,466
- You should be in a plastic bubble.
- Plastic.

788
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:09,615
- That explains it.
- Explains what?

789
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,650
- Why you're so angry.
- I'm not angry, I'm allergic.

790
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:15,219
All I was saying was that it just,
you know...

791
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:19,324
...couldn't have been easy
being a kid sick like that all the time.

792
00:56:19,926 --> 00:56:26,092
I mean, not being able to have a dog
or a cat or ice cream or dust.

793
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,434
It wasn't bad.

794
00:56:29,602 --> 00:56:33,368
- Really?
- I got to hang out with my dad a lot.

795
00:56:34,107 --> 00:56:39,670
He was a sportswriter, so we got to watch
all the games on TV together...

796
00:56:39,846 --> 00:56:42,178
...and he taught me how to box.

797
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:45,143
Taught me how to take care of myself.

798
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:52,889
Well, I'm sure he was very proud of you.

799
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:56,190
Was?

800
00:56:59,766 --> 00:57:03,293
Yeah, I read on your file that he died
before you became an agent.

801
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:07,372
- You read my file?
- I had to make sure you weren't crazy.

802
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:12,801
- Yeah. Turns out you can't trust a file.
- Yeah, well, I guess you can't.

803
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:17,382
I thought I would've liked a tough tomboy
from Jersey whose mom was an agent.

804
00:57:17,717 --> 00:57:20,686
- You read my file?
- Worse.

805
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,082
Your book.

806
00:57:23,456 --> 00:57:25,515
Had to make sure you weren't crazy.

807
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:29,093
Turns out you can't trust a book.

808
00:57:32,765 --> 00:57:35,199
Yeah, they brought in this writer...

809
00:57:35,668 --> 00:57:39,729
...who managed to turn the entire story
into some fairy tale.

810
00:57:39,906 --> 00:57:42,807
In the first draft, he made it sound like
my mother died...

811
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:47,345
...single-handedly saving the country,
when all it was was just, you know, a...

812
00:57:47,514 --> 00:57:50,506
It was just a drug bust gone bad.

813
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:55,749
Sorry.

814
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,583
Sorry about your dad.

815
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:06,264
But I'm mostly sorry
you had to read that book.

816
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:09,733
I like the pictures, though.

817
00:58:10,336 --> 00:58:12,099
Oh, really?

818
00:58:12,272 --> 00:58:16,038
Yeah, especially that one with that guy.
What was his name?

819
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:18,270
Which one?

820
00:58:18,444 --> 00:58:21,936
The agent, the one
that was in the pageant with you.

821
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,885
Eric Matthews.

822
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:28,917
Yeah. He was hot.

823
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,418
I guess.

824
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:36,288
Night, Hart.

825
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,096
Good night, Fuller.

826
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:50,800
<i>Foreman, we're in. Approaching target.</i>

827
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:00,219
Welcome to Prestige Assisted Living.
How can I help you?

828
00:59:00,386 --> 00:59:02,684
Hi, I'm Joel Flammenbaum,
and this is my mother.

829
00:59:02,855 --> 00:59:07,349
Ida. Ida Flammenbaum. How are you?
This is my lovely nurse, Rosie.

830
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:09,154
- Hello.
- She's not very social...

831
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:13,698
...but she gives a superb enema
if you're feeling a little clogged up.

832
00:59:14,567 --> 00:59:16,660
Are you interested
in touring our facilities?

833
00:59:16,836 --> 00:59:19,805
Oh, yes, we are very interested.
I can't wait to get rid of her.

834
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:25,206
Oh, don't you listen to him. He's a mama's
boy. Come here, cutie. Let me fix your tie.

835
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:27,209
- He's such a mama's boy.
- Mom, not now.

836
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:31,180
Now, that is a mama's boy's face.
That's a mama's boy's face.

837
00:59:31,618 --> 00:59:34,052
Do you have a euthanasia program?

838
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:38,455
We just need to fill out some forms.
If you'll just give me one minute.

839
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:40,086
Keep the receptionist busy.

840
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,718
We're gonna ask some questions,
assuming we can find anyone that can hear.

841
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:46,763
Hold my purse. Let's roll, Rosie.

842
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:51,231
<i>Hello there. I'm Ida Flammenbaum.
I am new.</i>

843
00:59:51,404 --> 00:59:53,599
Well, I'm not new.

844
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:56,139
- And you are?
- Buster Harrison.

845
00:59:56,309 --> 01:00:02,214
Oh, Buster. Is it true that Stan Fields'
mother is residing here?

846
01:00:02,382 --> 01:00:05,180
Yes, she's right over there.

847
01:00:06,286 --> 01:00:10,382
Carol? This is Ida.
She wanted to meet you.

848
01:00:11,758 --> 01:00:17,856
Oh, Buster. Oh, Buster, I'm so sorry. Give
Buster one of your famous foot massages.

849
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:21,899
Hey. While I'm at it, how about one
of my famous enemas?

850
01:00:22,068 --> 01:00:24,002
Can you get two of them in a day?

851
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:27,333
Mrs. Fields, Mrs. Fields.

852
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,106
Sounds like the cookie. It's very funny.

853
01:00:30,276 --> 01:00:32,972
Not after you've heard it
for 30 years, Ida.

854
01:00:33,146 --> 01:00:35,376
I'm sure. I just wanted
to come over here...

855
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:39,382
...and tell you how very sorry I am
about the kidnapping.

856
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:42,919
Oh, yeah, poor, poor Stanley.

857
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:45,417
But he had it coming.

858
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:48,093
Really?

859
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:52,322
Well, from what I hear from everyone,
he's such a mensch.

860
01:00:52,498 --> 01:00:57,731
- I mean, who would wanna hurt him?
- Well, you know, he loved the sluts.

861
01:01:00,606 --> 01:01:02,471
He loved the sluts?

862
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,906
<i>- The sluts!
- The sluts.</i>

863
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,946
- The slut machines.
- Slot machines.

864
01:01:09,115 --> 01:01:12,983
When he wasn't doing that pageant,
he was here in Vegas, gambling.

865
01:01:13,152 --> 01:01:14,983
I don't know where he gets that from.

866
01:01:15,154 --> 01:01:19,716
So you were saying... You were saying
that your son, he loves the slot machines.

867
01:01:19,892 --> 01:01:22,224
I begged him to stop. I said to him:

868
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:25,455
"One of these days, gambling's
gonna get you in a lot of trouble".

869
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:28,156
I lent him 600 bucks,
I never got it back.

870
01:01:28,334 --> 01:01:31,497
I was ready to break his legs,
and I'm his mother.

871
01:01:31,671 --> 01:01:33,662
Wait till the loan sharks
get a hold of him.

872
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,674
The loan sharks every time will get you.
They're very...

873
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,779
Loan shark.

874
01:01:44,584 --> 01:01:48,645
- It's the loan sharks.
- Ida, you can walk!

875
01:01:49,856 --> 01:01:51,585
- Praise Jesus!
- Moses.

876
01:01:51,758 --> 01:01:55,057
Moses, I am walking again.
Sign me up for this place.

877
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:57,753
<i>I love it here, and the men
make me all fakakta.</i>

878
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:03,768
Jeff, why are we here?

879
01:02:03,936 --> 01:02:06,131
- Because we had a deal, Gracie.
- Okay, look.

880
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:10,105
Deals are like pearls. They're lovely,
but they fall apart all the time.

881
01:02:10,276 --> 01:02:12,744
I'm grabbing your luggage.
We're going to the airport.

882
01:02:12,912 --> 01:02:14,971
Didn't you hear
what Stan's mother said?

883
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,616
Yes, I did. "Sluts".
I wrote it down, all right?

884
01:02:17,784 --> 01:02:20,582
"Loan shark". That's why
we have to get back to the Bureau...

885
01:02:20,753 --> 01:02:23,017
...do a CHC printout
of every loan shark in Vegas.

886
01:02:23,189 --> 01:02:26,386
You can't go to the Bureau.
You are supposed to be in New York.

887
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,221
And that is why you can go
and you can take...

888
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:31,590
- No! No!
- Okay, look, Jeff...

889
01:02:31,764 --> 01:02:35,530
...I don't like to use my gun unless it's
in self-defense or at a really good sale...

890
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:39,000
...but if you don't go back
and get those CHCs, I have to...

891
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,696
You know, I have to shoot you.

892
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:43,473
You won't do it, Gracie.

893
01:02:46,879 --> 01:02:49,006
This is what I like.
Learning to work together.

894
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,412
A little "Ebony & Ivory" action.

895
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:55,815
- Guys, I can't do it.
- Stop being a wuss, Foreman. Be a man!

896
01:02:55,988 --> 01:02:57,455
Yeah, like Fuller.

897
01:02:57,623 --> 01:03:01,354
Okay. But this is it. Then we're going
to the airport. Enough's enough.

898
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,620
- Absolutely. Okay.
- I'm putting my foot down.

899
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:05,855
He's putting his foot down.

900
01:03:16,909 --> 01:03:21,710
Got some high-def tapes for the new
ransom video. More production value.

901
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,542
Bro...

902
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:25,977
...maybe we should get out now.

903
01:03:26,152 --> 01:03:29,588
Are you kidding? We got them where
we want them. They're getting nervous.

904
01:03:29,755 --> 01:03:31,848
But if they don't agree
to our demands, we...

905
01:03:32,024 --> 01:03:33,616
That's why we're making a new one.

906
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:37,058
We're gonna have Miss United States say
we're moving up the deadline.

907
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:41,394
And either we get our cash wired to an
offshore account tonight, or she's dead.

908
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,365
So, what do we do? Shoot them?

909
01:03:44,537 --> 01:03:49,736
No. We're gonna kill them
and get a little payback at the hotel.

910
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,901
You know how location
is everything in Vegas, right?

911
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:57,243
Well, after we pull this off, Treasure
Island's gonna be a big, ugly crime site.

912
01:03:57,683 --> 01:04:00,447
- What, are we just gonna drive in?
- No.

913
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:04,056
Just before the show starts, we'll tie
them up at the bottom of the boat.

914
01:04:04,223 --> 01:04:07,556
That ship sinks,
so long, Miss United States.

915
01:04:17,503 --> 01:04:19,164
- Hey, guys.
- Foreman.

916
01:04:19,338 --> 01:04:20,600
Nice job with Dolly Parton.

917
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:25,210
Yeah. We've been after Dolly for a long
time, but it took you to finally bring her in.

918
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:31,449
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

919
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:35,109
Remember what Louis Vuitton said,
"It's in the bag". You can do this.

920
01:04:35,855 --> 01:04:37,083
Okay.

921
01:04:37,256 --> 01:04:38,484
He can't do this.

922
01:04:38,658 --> 01:04:42,424
Going down like a fat woman
on a greased fire pole.

923
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,953
I heard that.

924
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,608
I'm going into the database.

925
01:04:59,779 --> 01:05:03,180
- Great. Just keep us filled in.
- Okay.

926
01:05:03,783 --> 01:05:06,752
Someone left a can of soda
by the keyboard.

927
01:05:06,919 --> 01:05:08,250
I'm sweating profusely.

928
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,623
<i>I think I left my oven on.</i>

929
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,757
<i>- We're printing.
- Awesome, Jeff. Awesome. You did it.</i>

930
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:21,297
<i>- Fuller just lost a bet.
- Not over yet.</i>

931
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:24,762
- Agent Collins, if you could just answer a...
- Agent Collins!

932
01:05:24,937 --> 01:05:28,065
All right, this is gonna be
the last question. Yes, go ahead.

933
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,674
What happens if tomorrow's deadline
comes and goes...

934
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,538
...and there's no break in the case?

935
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:35,875
We've spoken with the pageant
administration. We will not negotiate.

936
01:05:36,048 --> 01:05:40,314
They have one choice, and that is to free
Miss Frazier and Mr. Fields, and that's it.

937
01:05:40,486 --> 01:05:43,250
- No more questions. Thank you.
- Just one more question!

938
01:05:48,928 --> 01:05:50,828
- That's not right.
- What's not right?

939
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,725
No. It must be the height.

940
01:05:53,899 --> 01:05:56,595
- Jeff. Jeff, what's up? What's up?
- It's Janet.

941
01:05:56,769 --> 01:05:59,431
I'm not sure,
but I think she's with...

942
01:05:59,605 --> 01:06:00,936
<i>With what? With you?</i>

943
01:06:01,107 --> 01:06:05,100
Withholding evidence?
With child? With what?

944
01:06:05,277 --> 01:06:07,074
<i>With what?!</i>

945
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,771
With Collins.

946
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:11,611
<i>Foreman!</i>

947
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:13,648
Foreman.

948
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:21,019
- What are you doing with CHCs?
- They're for the Miss United States case.

949
01:06:21,193 --> 01:06:24,026
- What about that case?
- Were the two of you just...?

950
01:06:24,196 --> 01:06:26,824
Jeff, chill! Okay, you've just
gotta get out of there.

951
01:06:26,999 --> 01:06:29,194
Foreman, why do you have
those rap sheets?

952
01:06:29,368 --> 01:06:32,769
<i>A general database check to see
if there were any suspects worth pursuing.</i>

953
01:06:32,938 --> 01:06:37,136
I was doing a general database check to see
if there were any suspects worth pursuing.

954
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:39,072
Were you two just...?

955
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:43,978
This isn't a general database check. This is
a felony-specific search for loan sharks.

956
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:46,141
Say you noticed
on the kidnapping video...

957
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:48,878
<i>...the assailants were attempting
to abduct Stan Fields.</i>

958
01:06:49,055 --> 01:06:50,989
- Foreman, I want an answer.
- Say it again.

959
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:53,424
I want an answer.

960
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:56,891
<i>- On the kidnapping video, the assailants...
- what is wrong with you?</i>

961
01:06:57,063 --> 01:06:58,894
- Say it faster.
- What's wrong with you?

962
01:06:59,065 --> 01:07:01,693
The assailants were attempting
to abduct Stan Fields...

963
01:07:01,867 --> 01:07:05,064
...and you found out that Stan Fields
had a gambling problem. Water.

964
01:07:05,237 --> 01:07:07,831
I saw the assailants attempting
to abduct Stan Fields...

965
01:07:08,007 --> 01:07:11,067
...so I pursued the matter and found
out he has a gambling problem.

966
01:07:11,243 --> 01:07:14,178
You pursued the matter further?
Under whose authority?

967
01:07:14,346 --> 01:07:17,474
- You've gotta lie, Foreman.
- Foreman, I am waiting.

968
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:20,915
Tell him that I'm dizzy from smashing
a suspect's head into the wall...

969
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:23,112
...and I can't remember.
That always works.

970
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,086
You know what I like to do? Faint.

971
01:07:25,257 --> 01:07:28,021
We can't do this, guys. He's honest.

972
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:31,320
<i>- Jeff, tell him the truth.
- The truth?</i>

973
01:07:31,497 --> 01:07:33,727
- Are you sure?
- Am I sure I want the truth?

974
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:36,163
Foreman, I want you to get a CAT scan.

975
01:07:38,003 --> 01:07:40,801
I didn't get this information.
Agents Hart and Fuller did.

976
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:44,136
<i>- How? They're in New York.
- Well, at the airport...</i>

977
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,471
They're not in New York.

978
01:07:56,722 --> 01:07:58,053
Hart?

979
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,817
- Yes, sir.
- I assume that Agent Fuller is with you.

980
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:05,156
<i>- Yes, sir.
- And Joel.</i>

981
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,231
Hello, Walter.

982
01:08:10,269 --> 01:08:13,932
I want all of you
in the situation room now.

983
01:08:14,406 --> 01:08:16,840
- That is exactly what I want. That's right.
- Sir.

984
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:20,943
I want you to know that none of this
was Agent Foreman's idea.

985
01:08:21,113 --> 01:08:24,014
Oh, I know, I know.
Because Foreman doesn't have any ideas.

986
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,174
This has you written all over it, Hart.

987
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,912
You've really gotta do things
your way, don't you?

988
01:08:29,088 --> 01:08:32,580
Dolce and Gabbana always said we should
express our own personal style, sir.

989
01:08:32,758 --> 01:08:35,420
- They were talking about a vest...
- You're no super agent.

990
01:08:35,594 --> 01:08:39,928
You're just a loose cannon who lucked into
being in the right place at the right time.

991
01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:42,329
You don't have to be that hard on her.
She was...

992
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:44,992
Oh, I am so glad you're with her
on this, Fuller...

993
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:48,072
...because you two are going down
together. The works.

994
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,937
- Review board, departmental hearings...
- Sir, we got another message e-mailed.

995
01:08:52,411 --> 01:08:54,072
Show me.

996
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,116
<i>- Play it.
- This is Cheryl Frazier.</i>

997
01:08:58,284 --> 01:09:00,445
<i>Hi, again.</i>

998
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:05,454
<i>The deadline has been changed.
It's not tomorrow, it's tonight.</i>

999
01:09:05,624 --> 01:09:08,650
<i>The kidnappers are going to fax instructions
to the pageant...</i>

1000
01:09:08,828 --> 01:09:10,591
<i>...where the 5 million should be sent.</i>

1001
01:09:10,763 --> 01:09:14,199
<i>And if they don't receive it,
I'm going to be dead.</i>

1002
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:20,431
<i>And I know it's a lot of money,
but it's my booty on the line.</i>

1003
01:09:21,507 --> 01:09:23,668
<i>- So...
- This is Stan Fields...</i>

1004
01:09:23,843 --> 01:09:29,372
<i>...and she's too young to die.
And I'm not as old as I look. So please.</i>

1005
01:09:29,782 --> 01:09:31,113
We also got this, sir.

1006
01:09:31,283 --> 01:09:35,379
A clerk at a print store saw a suspicious
man e-mail a message about an hour ago.

1007
01:09:35,554 --> 01:09:39,490
Aerial spotted a pickup truck matching
the vehicle in the kidnapping video...

1008
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:41,683
...heading south on 15.
- You see this?

1009
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:46,764
This is real information.
Not Dolly Parton and senior homes.

1010
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,627
That's how we do it in Vegas.

1011
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:53,630
I want roadblocks on I-15
and increased surveillance at the airports.

1012
01:09:53,806 --> 01:09:56,001
- Foreman?
- Yes, sir.

1013
01:09:56,175 --> 01:10:00,111
I want you to put agents Hart, Fuller and
Joel on the first flight back to New York.

1014
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,544
To make sure there's no problem,
Okun and Hills will be going with you.

1015
01:10:03,716 --> 01:10:06,583
And if you get it wrong this time,
you are fired. Do you copy?

1016
01:10:06,752 --> 01:10:10,483
That won't be necessary, because nobody
is getting fired, and nobody is leaving.

1017
01:10:10,656 --> 01:10:11,953
Wrong again, Hart!

1018
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:16,026
And if I ever see you in my city again,
you can forget about the review board.

1019
01:10:16,195 --> 01:10:18,663
I will have you arrested
for obstruction of justice...

1020
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:23,097
...and you can spend a very long time
in Las Vegas, in a jail cell.

1021
01:10:23,269 --> 01:10:28,730
I have really had just about enough of your
rudeness and insensitivity and cologne.

1022
01:10:28,908 --> 01:10:32,435
Oh, really? And what are you gonna do
about it? Call the director?

1023
01:10:32,611 --> 01:10:35,307
Go ahead. I got off the phone with him.
Know what he said?

1024
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,382
He said that you are the biggest mistake
he ever made.

1025
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:41,019
And he said, and I quote...

1026
01:10:41,186 --> 01:10:45,316
...that you "have become a liability
and an embarrassment to the Bureau".

1027
01:10:56,491 --> 01:10:58,288
Now, get going.

1028
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,649
Okun.

1029
01:11:32,828 --> 01:11:36,730
It's Collins.
Yes, sir, we're at the airport.

1030
01:11:36,898 --> 01:11:39,196
- Is he mad at me?
- Sorry, sir, I'm losing you.

1031
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:42,769
- Does he wanna talk to me?
- Foreman! Leave him alone!

1032
01:11:43,538 --> 01:11:45,472
<i>Now boarding, flight 624 to New York.</i>

1033
01:11:54,049 --> 01:11:56,643
Yeah. I was looking at your ad...

1034
01:11:56,818 --> 01:12:00,720
...and I was wondering if you have
a Dolly Parton performer.

1035
01:12:01,523 --> 01:12:03,013
No?

1036
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,188
Okay.

1037
01:12:10,732 --> 01:12:14,532
Hart, maybe you were right about Dolly.
Maybe you just had the wrong Dolly.

1038
01:12:14,703 --> 01:12:16,967
- You don't know if they have a Dolly.
- They don't.

1039
01:12:17,139 --> 01:12:19,972
I just called there, and they said
the only place in Vegas...

1040
01:12:20,142 --> 01:12:23,202
...that has a Dolly Parton performer
is the Oasis Drag club.

1041
01:12:23,378 --> 01:12:25,710
Just get on the plane, Fuller.

1042
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:32,086
- Do you wanna save Cheryl or not?
- I'm gonna get her killed.

1043
01:12:32,254 --> 01:12:35,712
What's up with you? What happened
to that girl from the pageant?

1044
01:12:35,891 --> 01:12:37,688
She's gone.

1045
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:41,727
Her boyfriend, Eric Matthews, broke up
with her, and it was absolutely devastating.

1046
01:12:41,897 --> 01:12:43,660
Is that what happened to you?

1047
01:12:43,965 --> 01:12:47,594
Oh, that's pathetic. Come on.

1048
01:12:47,769 --> 01:12:51,500
Plenty of guys have broken up with me.
You just beat them up and move on.

1049
01:12:51,673 --> 01:12:54,767
Only you and Foreman
turn it into some big soap opera.

1050
01:12:54,943 --> 01:12:59,880
Well. Of course you don't understand
how Jeff feels, because he's not a cyborg.

1051
01:13:01,616 --> 01:13:05,484
He knows what it feels like
to be rejected and humiliated.

1052
01:13:08,924 --> 01:13:10,448
To feel your heart ripped open...

1053
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:14,391
...because you finally took a chance
on that relationship...

1054
01:13:15,363 --> 01:13:17,593
...and it wound up confirming
your worst fears...

1055
01:13:17,766 --> 01:13:21,862
...that you are worthless
and not worth caring about.

1056
01:13:26,608 --> 01:13:32,410
So you may not understand,
but that is how Jeff feels.

1057
01:13:40,722 --> 01:13:42,986
Matthews was right to dump you.

1058
01:13:45,861 --> 01:13:50,924
- Take that back.
- I would say, "Make me", but you can't.

1059
01:13:54,769 --> 01:13:56,430
Okay.

1060
01:13:56,671 --> 01:13:58,696
All right. Well...

1061
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,802
...then I just have two things to say.

1062
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:05,138
- What?
- First of all, we are in a public place...

1063
01:14:05,313 --> 01:14:09,943
...so we have to display a sense
of decorum, and second of all...

1064
01:14:10,218 --> 01:14:11,651
...I might break a nail.

1065
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:15,487
Take it back! Take it back.

1066
01:14:16,324 --> 01:14:18,087
Jeez!

1067
01:14:20,929 --> 01:14:23,830
All the stuff that Collins said back there
was a bunch of bull.

1068
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:26,024
You figured out the limo driver was dirty.

1069
01:14:26,201 --> 01:14:28,567
You figured out that they were after Stan.

1070
01:14:28,737 --> 01:14:31,001
You're not lucky. You're good.

1071
01:14:35,343 --> 01:14:38,403
Thank you. But take it back,
take it back, take it back.

1072
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,947
Okay, I'll take it back.
I'll take it back if you admit one thing.

1073
01:14:42,684 --> 01:14:44,743
Oh, God!

1074
01:14:46,221 --> 01:14:50,749
For the first time in a long time,
you feel like the real Gracie Hart.

1075
01:14:55,563 --> 01:14:57,224
Oh, my God.

1076
01:14:57,399 --> 01:14:59,424
Oh, my God.

1077
01:14:59,601 --> 01:15:02,934
Straining muscles
cutting off someone's air supply.

1078
01:15:03,104 --> 01:15:04,503
Sweating like a pig.

1079
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:09,972
You're right, I feel like a woman again.

1080
01:15:10,445 --> 01:15:12,470
Good. I take it back. Now release.

1081
01:15:12,981 --> 01:15:14,471
You first.

1082
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:15,877
- On three.
- One.

1083
01:15:16,051 --> 01:15:18,519
Two. Three.

1084
01:15:20,288 --> 01:15:23,086
Oh, no.

1085
01:15:24,192 --> 01:15:26,092
Okay, just to show you I trust you.

1086
01:15:30,799 --> 01:15:35,429
Now boarding all passengers
for flight 624 to New York.

1087
01:15:36,171 --> 01:15:37,661
Thanks.

1088
01:15:38,106 --> 01:15:39,869
All right.

1089
01:15:40,275 --> 01:15:43,802
Okay, kids, time for the circus
to leave town.

1090
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:46,547
Come on, girls.

1091
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:48,840
How are we gonna get rid of these guys?

1092
01:15:49,017 --> 01:15:51,008
I don't know. But it has to be subtle.

1093
01:15:51,186 --> 01:15:52,653
Keep it moving.

1094
01:15:55,991 --> 01:15:57,856
God!

1095
01:15:58,259 --> 01:15:59,783
Lordy!

1096
01:15:59,961 --> 01:16:01,622
Ladies' time.

1097
01:16:01,796 --> 01:16:04,959
I have the cramps. I have to...
I have to go to the bathroom.

1098
01:16:05,133 --> 01:16:06,532
There's one on the plane.

1099
01:16:06,701 --> 01:16:10,694
I know, but, guys, PMS for me means
"pants might shred", so I gotta...

1100
01:16:10,872 --> 01:16:14,706
- Forget it, Hart.
- Guys, you don't understand. I bloat.

1101
01:16:14,876 --> 01:16:19,643
I take on water, and I expand, and I may
change the cabin pressure of that plane.

1102
01:16:19,814 --> 01:16:21,805
I gotta take her to the bathroom.

1103
01:16:23,218 --> 01:16:26,654
- I need a tampon!
- You heard her, we got a agent down.

1104
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:29,289
We need tampons!

1105
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:32,682
- I'm not getting those.
- I don't do it for my wife.

1106
01:16:32,861 --> 01:16:35,193
This is a job for a real man.
Any particular brand?

1107
01:16:35,363 --> 01:16:37,888
- Any brand.
- Janet liked the ones in the blue box...

1108
01:16:38,066 --> 01:16:39,363
...with the daisies on it.

1109
01:16:39,534 --> 01:16:43,368
You're really not following this, are you?
Something's up.

1110
01:16:49,611 --> 01:16:51,511
Tampons.

1111
01:16:55,483 --> 01:16:57,314
Give them a couple minutes.

1112
01:17:09,364 --> 01:17:11,457
Zero-one, what do you got?

1113
01:17:13,435 --> 01:17:17,337
- No movement. Good to go.
- Copy that. Griffin, go to green.

1114
01:17:36,624 --> 01:17:37,989
FBI! Get down!

1115
01:17:40,228 --> 01:17:42,696
- Nobody move!
- Clear!

1116
01:17:42,864 --> 01:17:45,264
Sir, it's empty.

1117
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,560
You heard the FBI, bro.
They're not gonna pay.

1118
01:17:48,736 --> 01:17:51,261
They'll pay, or we'll kill Fields
and Frazier.

1119
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:53,907
Let's see them explain that
at their press conference.

1120
01:17:54,075 --> 01:17:57,067
- How'd you know they'd come?
- Choppers.

1121
01:17:57,245 --> 01:17:59,770
Twice a day they fly to Vegas
to do traffic reports...

1122
01:17:59,948 --> 01:18:02,382
...but that last one didn't come
at rush hour.

1123
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:04,040
I knew it was them.

1124
01:18:04,219 --> 01:18:06,653
I said, stay down!

1125
01:18:10,024 --> 01:18:15,018
Griffin, secure a 500-foot perimeter
and get me something.

1126
01:18:15,196 --> 01:18:18,962
Tire tracks, cigarette butts for DNA,
but something.

1127
01:18:19,134 --> 01:18:21,159
You got it, sir.

1128
01:18:23,071 --> 01:18:27,337
Sir, I just got a call from Agent Okun.
Hart didn't get on the plane.

1129
01:18:29,677 --> 01:18:32,077
I need a minute with Agent McCarran.

1130
01:18:37,719 --> 01:18:40,984
Well, apparently, she faked a case
of cramps and escaped with Fuller.

1131
01:18:41,156 --> 01:18:42,714
Where's your idiot boyfriend?

1132
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:46,850
Ex-boyfriend! He was on his way to buy
tampons for her when he left with them.

1133
01:18:47,028 --> 01:18:49,826
Oh, well, how very, very considerate.

1134
01:18:49,998 --> 01:18:53,991
I don't have time for this.
She is ruining my investigation!

1135
01:18:54,169 --> 01:18:57,866
She's just trying to get another bestseller
out of this, Walter.

1136
01:18:58,039 --> 01:19:01,133
This should be your bestseller.

1137
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:03,834
You're right.

1138
01:19:04,012 --> 01:19:05,479
You're right.

1139
01:19:05,647 --> 01:19:11,085
I want you to find her and Fuller
and arrest them for obstruction of justice.

1140
01:19:20,328 --> 01:19:23,354
We're in the clear. Joel, where are they?
Someone's gonna see us.

1141
01:19:23,965 --> 01:19:26,331
They said they had to get ready
for the mission.

1142
01:19:26,501 --> 01:19:28,401
Well, we are running out of time.

1143
01:19:57,899 --> 01:20:00,367
- Come on, Laverne and Shirley, move it!
- Ready?

1144
01:20:00,535 --> 01:20:02,503
- Armed.
- And fabulous, except for the...

1145
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:04,968
Let's go. Jeff, you got the rap sheets.

1146
01:20:05,473 --> 01:20:07,737
All right, this guy...
This guy's still in prison.

1147
01:20:07,909 --> 01:20:12,369
This guy is too short
to match the surveillance video.

1148
01:20:12,547 --> 01:20:15,539
This guy is...
This guy's brothers with this guy.

1149
01:20:15,717 --> 01:20:16,945
Burglary, grand theft auto.

1150
01:20:17,118 --> 01:20:19,382
Hold on. How are we supposed
to get to Dolly?

1151
01:20:19,554 --> 01:20:22,387
We go to the drag club,
flash our badges and interrogate her.

1152
01:20:22,557 --> 01:20:24,149
And if she doesn't cooperate?

1153
01:20:24,325 --> 01:20:26,452
Violence. I have some catching up to do.

1154
01:20:26,628 --> 01:20:30,257
Then she's gonna call the cops and say
that she was attacked by Gracie Hart.

1155
01:20:30,431 --> 01:20:34,060
Then Collins is gonna find out about it,
and we'll all end up in the big house.

1156
01:20:34,235 --> 01:20:36,226
- We gotta blend in.
- Not to worry.

1157
01:20:36,404 --> 01:20:39,532
I know what to do. I've been waiting
for this moment my entire life.

1158
01:20:58,259 --> 01:21:02,958
Let's go over this again. We're not leaving
until we find and interrogate Dolly Parton.

1159
01:21:03,131 --> 01:21:05,258
That's something
I never thought I'd say. Jeff?

1160
01:21:05,433 --> 01:21:10,063
- I'm backup. If Dolly tries to flee, I got her.
- I'm gonna check out the dressing rooms.

1161
01:21:10,405 --> 01:21:12,600
I'm really just here to have a good time.

1162
01:21:12,774 --> 01:21:16,301
Oh, God, I just don't see why
I couldn't be Tina.

1163
01:21:16,477 --> 01:21:18,741
- You don't see that?
- I am the Tina Turner fan.

1164
01:21:18,913 --> 01:21:22,212
Ladies, knock it off. We are here
to get information. Earpieces in?

1165
01:21:22,383 --> 01:21:24,374
All right, let's move.

1166
01:21:45,373 --> 01:21:47,671
- I wanna go in there.
- Go backstage?

1167
01:21:53,147 --> 01:21:55,377
Liza plus two, you're up next.

1168
01:21:57,385 --> 01:22:00,548
Hello. I'm Elizabeth Taylor.
What do we have here?

1169
01:22:01,122 --> 01:22:02,646
Tina and...?

1170
01:22:02,857 --> 01:22:05,655
- Coco.
- Where do you think you're going?

1171
01:22:05,827 --> 01:22:09,092
The only people who get to go
to the dressing rooms are our regulars...

1172
01:22:09,263 --> 01:22:11,527
...and our open-mikers
after they pass round one.

1173
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:15,160
Could you step aside, coco?
And you are?

1174
01:22:15,336 --> 01:22:19,329
She's classy, she's lovely,
she's perfect to a T.

1175
01:22:19,507 --> 01:22:23,375
My very favorite, Liza with a Z.

1176
01:22:41,095 --> 01:22:44,326
<i>- Foreman.
- Jeff? Hi, it's Janet.</i>

1177
01:22:44,499 --> 01:22:47,161
I just wanted to talk to you about us.

1178
01:22:47,802 --> 01:22:51,294
<i>- Now's not a good time.
- Is that Liza Minnelli in the background?</i>

1179
01:22:51,472 --> 01:22:55,738
Yeah. On the radio.
I'm just home, listening to Liza.

1180
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:57,500
I don't want it to end this way.

1181
01:22:57,678 --> 01:23:00,476
I know that you're mad at me,
but I still care about you...

1182
01:23:00,648 --> 01:23:04,106
- Got it.
- Just give me a call if you get a chance.

1183
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:14,955
Two-block radius of Koval and Harmon.

1184
01:23:15,129 --> 01:23:18,587
Liza Minnelli. I know where he is.
Let's move.

1185
01:23:35,216 --> 01:23:38,481
Oh, you go, Miss Minnelli!
You are definitely on to the next round.

1186
01:23:38,653 --> 01:23:41,417
Why don't you go rest up backstage.

1187
01:23:41,589 --> 01:23:42,817
Wasn't she wonderful?

1188
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:47,127
Bad news. We want in those
dressing rooms, we have to perform.

1189
01:23:47,295 --> 01:23:50,594
I am not going out there as a woman
pretending to be a man...

1190
01:23:50,765 --> 01:23:53,962
...pretending to be Tina Turner.
I can't afford therapy on my salary.

1191
01:23:54,135 --> 01:23:56,763
What other choice do we have?
No! No!

1192
01:23:57,238 --> 01:24:01,766
You can do this. Okay, you can
because you are Sam Fuller, FBI...

1193
01:24:01,943 --> 01:24:04,070
...and nothing scares you.
I am Gracie Hart...

1194
01:24:04,245 --> 01:24:08,147
...and at this moment, I am also Big Bird,
and nothing scares me...

1195
01:24:08,316 --> 01:24:14,277
...except losing Cheryl because having
a friend like her, having any friend, for me...

1196
01:24:14,455 --> 01:24:17,356
...is a really, really rare thing, okay?

1197
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:20,623
Okay, but I am not singing.

1198
01:24:20,795 --> 01:24:23,525
Fabulous Tina Turner!

1199
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:27,532
Everything is gonna be okay.
Just be Tina-ish.

1200
01:24:37,645 --> 01:24:39,169
- You can do Tina.
- Just take it.

1201
01:24:39,347 --> 01:24:41,815
- I am not singing.
- Just take it.

1202
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:45,612
How come he gets to go first?
I was here before him!

1203
01:24:45,786 --> 01:24:49,722
It's all right here on my list, in alphabetical
order. Tina, then Tina, then Tina.

1204
01:24:49,891 --> 01:24:54,419
And you're all doing the same song anyway.
What's the difference? Hit it.

1205
01:24:56,297 --> 01:24:57,992
Smile.

1206
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:01,327
- You smiling?
- I am smiling.

1207
01:25:01,502 --> 01:25:02,730
Come on, boys!

1208
01:25:24,559 --> 01:25:26,220
Bring back Liza!

1209
01:25:42,843 --> 01:25:44,674
Thank you and good night.

1210
01:25:44,845 --> 01:25:48,042
No, no, we have to stay here.
Stay here. Shake. Shake.

1211
01:25:49,216 --> 01:25:52,549
Oh, shoot. He's gonna give us the hook.
Sell it, Tina.

1212
01:26:09,937 --> 01:26:11,234
Rolling.

1213
01:26:16,711 --> 01:26:19,271
- I found Dolly!
- What's he saying?

1214
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:31,290
Tinas of the world, unite!
Take the stage!

1215
01:26:31,459 --> 01:26:33,017
Shake!

1216
01:26:41,102 --> 01:26:43,127
I found Dolly.
He picked me up at the bar...

1217
01:26:43,304 --> 01:26:47,331
...and invited me to dressing room five.
I'm glad I wore the heels.

1218
01:26:51,779 --> 01:26:54,441
- Joel found Dolly in dressing room five.
- Got it.

1219
01:27:01,522 --> 01:27:04,082
- We need a big finish.
- Maybe I should take my top off.

1220
01:27:04,258 --> 01:27:05,953
No, we need a good big finish.

1221
01:27:11,966 --> 01:27:13,365
- Pick me up.
- No.

1222
01:27:13,534 --> 01:27:15,126
FBI. Pick me up!

1223
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:28,715
Settle down, settle down.

1224
01:27:29,183 --> 01:27:31,344
- Smile!
- Well, I personally didn't love it...

1225
01:27:31,519 --> 01:27:33,248
...but what's love got to do with it?

1226
01:27:33,421 --> 01:27:36,390
The crowd decides and tonight
the drinks must be strong...

1227
01:27:36,557 --> 01:27:39,321
...because this Tina's moving on
to the next round!

1228
01:27:40,594 --> 01:27:42,653
Come on, come on!

1229
01:27:47,168 --> 01:27:49,398
All right, he said dressing room
number five.

1230
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,970
It's that one right there.
Joel, let us handle this.

1231
01:27:52,139 --> 01:27:54,266
- He invited me!
- I'll get you his phone number.

1232
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:58,673
Hello? Can I help you boys?

1233
01:27:58,846 --> 01:28:01,508
What do you know about
the Miss United States kidnapping?

1234
01:28:01,682 --> 01:28:03,673
Tom Abernathy, the limo driver.

1235
01:28:03,851 --> 01:28:07,617
You paid him 200 bucks to park far away
from the entrance to the senior home. Why?

1236
01:28:07,788 --> 01:28:10,882
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please leave.

1237
01:28:12,493 --> 01:28:16,987
You know, normally I would calmly
interrogate you, but I'm kind of in a rush.

1238
01:28:17,164 --> 01:28:18,495
- I don't know anything!
- Talk!

1239
01:28:18,666 --> 01:28:21,533
- No, please! It wasn't me. It was some guy.
- What guy?

1240
01:28:21,702 --> 01:28:24,364
I met him when I was a keno girl
at Treasure Island.

1241
01:28:24,538 --> 01:28:26,870
I borrowed money from him
and couldn't pay it back.

1242
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:29,100
- He said he would dump...
- what was his name?!

1243
01:28:29,276 --> 01:28:34,043
Ken? Cal? Karl? I don't remember.
He didn't tell me his last name.

1244
01:28:35,049 --> 01:28:36,846
Karl.

1245
01:28:37,051 --> 01:28:39,451
- Karl Steele was on that sheet.
- One of the brothers.

1246
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:44,057
Lou and Karl Steele, armed robbery, grand
theft auto. You met him at Treasure Island.

1247
01:28:45,426 --> 01:28:47,053
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

1248
01:28:47,228 --> 01:28:49,253
Treasure Island,
that's where they took them.

1249
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:52,331
- How do you know?
- Dolly said the Steele brothers were pirates.

1250
01:28:54,969 --> 01:28:57,529
Janet is here with backup.

1251
01:28:57,705 --> 01:29:00,640
<i>I repeat, Janet is here.</i>

1252
01:29:00,908 --> 01:29:02,273
Jeff?

1253
01:29:02,443 --> 01:29:04,536
- Where is she?
- Where is who?

1254
01:29:05,212 --> 01:29:07,737
- You are a lousy liar, Jeff.
- Yeah.

1255
01:29:08,382 --> 01:29:10,316
And you're a good one.

1256
01:29:13,621 --> 01:29:17,284
- How are we gonna get out of here?
- I don't know, but it has to be subtle.

1257
01:29:38,913 --> 01:29:42,849
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the next show
will be in 20 minutes.</i>

1258
01:29:49,023 --> 01:29:50,923
Okay, let's go.

1259
01:29:52,126 --> 01:29:54,458
You both keep your mouths shut,
or you're dead.

1260
01:29:54,628 --> 01:29:57,426
<i>The Steele brothers were fired
from the Treasure Island show.</i>

1261
01:29:57,598 --> 01:30:00,158
Cheryl said something
about her booty being on the line.

1262
01:30:00,334 --> 01:30:03,861
Cheryl would never refer to her ass
as a booty or refer to her ass, period.

1263
01:30:04,038 --> 01:30:05,266
She calls it a po-po.

1264
01:30:08,142 --> 01:30:09,837
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Excuse us!

1265
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:12,808
- FBI. We need your car.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

1266
01:30:14,582 --> 01:30:16,550
Get lost. Hey!

1267
01:30:16,717 --> 01:30:18,275
Hart, Hart! Too much!

1268
01:30:18,452 --> 01:30:21,421
Yeah, I know, but now I kind of see
why you enjoy it so much.

1269
01:30:21,589 --> 01:30:25,457
You are fine citizens, and you will get
your car back. Thank you very much.

1270
01:30:25,626 --> 01:30:27,856
- All right.
- Okay, here I come.

1271
01:30:28,596 --> 01:30:30,325
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna turn.
- Okay.

1272
01:30:31,165 --> 01:30:35,499
Sorry, sorry. What did Joel do,
weld this thing on...?

1273
01:30:43,344 --> 01:30:45,938
Just keep quiet, do as you're told
and nobody gets hurt.

1274
01:30:46,113 --> 01:30:48,138
I believe him.
Don't you believe him, Cheryl?

1275
01:30:48,315 --> 01:30:51,443
- He wouldn't lie about a thing like that.
- Will you just shut up?!

1276
01:30:55,022 --> 01:30:56,250
Jeff.

1277
01:30:56,423 --> 01:30:58,288
Jeff! Gracie and Sam went to...

1278
01:30:58,459 --> 01:31:01,019
Go on, if you don't wanna spend
a few years in prison...

1279
01:31:01,195 --> 01:31:03,390
...for obstruction of justice.

1280
01:31:03,864 --> 01:31:05,729
Which prison?

1281
01:31:07,835 --> 01:31:09,928
Just in case I don't get a chance
to say it...

1282
01:31:10,104 --> 01:31:13,437
...I'm sorry for getting on you
about that whole Matthews thing.

1283
01:31:13,607 --> 01:31:15,234
It was none of my business.

1284
01:31:15,409 --> 01:31:17,240
That's all right.

1285
01:31:17,544 --> 01:31:19,705
I scared him off.

1286
01:31:21,048 --> 01:31:25,485
But the thing is, right,
he came back to save me.

1287
01:31:25,653 --> 01:31:31,819
I mean, why would somebody come back
to save someone if they didn't have...

1288
01:31:32,126 --> 01:31:34,686
...feelings? You know?

1289
01:31:34,862 --> 01:31:39,094
I'm sure he liked you,
but maybe he was just doing his job.

1290
01:31:39,533 --> 01:31:41,000
Maybe.

1291
01:31:41,235 --> 01:31:45,331
Men. Can't live with them, you can't...

1292
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:48,137
- No, that's about it.
- Yep.

1293
01:31:48,309 --> 01:31:49,674
Okay, hold on.

1294
01:31:54,114 --> 01:31:55,945
Come on!

1295
01:31:58,419 --> 01:32:03,288
- Okay! Clearly that's not working.
- Don't start with me, Tina.

1296
01:32:12,633 --> 01:32:14,260
Are we gonna die?

1297
01:32:14,435 --> 01:32:16,699
Not if you develop gills
in the next five minutes.

1298
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:31,909
Let's go back through the casino.

1299
01:32:52,606 --> 01:32:55,268
Okay. I'm gonna take this side,
you take that...

1300
01:32:56,977 --> 01:32:58,444
The Steele brothers.

1301
01:32:58,612 --> 01:33:02,343
Lou! Lou and Karl Steele, freeze! FBI!
Freeze! Freeze!

1302
01:33:04,251 --> 01:33:06,082
- Keep going.
- Move. Move, move.

1303
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,309
Hey, hey!

1304
01:33:47,361 --> 01:33:49,488
We're gonna need more help
in sector four.

1305
01:33:55,803 --> 01:33:58,135
Where are Cheryl and Stan?

1306
01:33:58,305 --> 01:34:00,068
- Where?
- You're breaking my wrist.

1307
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:04,040
- Where are Cheryl and Stan?
- They're at the bottom of the boat.

1308
01:34:04,211 --> 01:34:05,644
What boat?!

1309
01:34:13,387 --> 01:34:14,718
Lou!

1310
01:34:15,456 --> 01:34:16,889
I'm coming, bro!

1311
01:34:19,193 --> 01:34:22,128
- I got your back.
- No, no. I got this. You go for Cheryl.

1312
01:34:22,296 --> 01:34:23,593
- You sure?
- I've got this!

1313
01:34:23,764 --> 01:34:25,129
Twenty dollars on the sister.

1314
01:34:25,799 --> 01:34:29,462
You're good.
I'm gonna enjoy this.

1315
01:34:55,095 --> 01:35:01,330
- Nothing left to talk about, lady.
- I'm not gonna talk. I'm gonna sing!

1316
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,404
Hope you weren't planning on reproducing.

1317
01:35:31,832 --> 01:35:35,768
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Gracie!

1318
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:38,928
Everything's gonna be okay.

1319
01:35:40,574 --> 01:35:43,771
- I've got you. Can you swim?
- Can I swim?

1320
01:35:43,944 --> 01:35:47,778
I made junior lifesaver at camp Mondago.
I was captain of the miniature golf team.

1321
01:35:47,948 --> 01:35:50,610
- Stan, just go! Go, go!
- Not without Cheryl!

1322
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,810
- Stan, I have her! Go! Go!
- Okay.

1323
01:35:53,987 --> 01:35:56,581
- Where?
- The back is blocked.

1324
01:35:56,757 --> 01:36:00,090
- Go to the nearest porthole. Right here.
- Oh, okay.

1325
01:36:02,162 --> 01:36:04,027
There's a cannon in my porthole!

1326
01:36:15,642 --> 01:36:17,701
- Pull! Come on, hurry!
- My God!

1327
01:36:18,779 --> 01:36:20,337
It's moving!

1328
01:36:20,547 --> 01:36:22,310
- Go!
- Here I go. Here I go.

1329
01:36:22,482 --> 01:36:24,507
Gracie!

1330
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:35,728
Hart jumped in a few minutes ago.

1331
01:36:37,598 --> 01:36:40,226
- Okun, Hills, help him!
- I can't swim, sir.

1332
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,732
I gave you an order.

1333
01:36:47,841 --> 01:36:49,775
Gracie...

1334
01:37:43,063 --> 01:37:48,000
- Miss United States.
- You can call me Cheryl.

1335
01:39:01,141 --> 01:39:03,837
It's okay, we got you. We got you.

1336
01:39:04,511 --> 01:39:06,035
And so all of our clues...

1337
01:39:06,346 --> 01:39:08,177
...eventually led us here. Here she is.

1338
01:39:11,885 --> 01:39:13,443
- Nice work, Hart.
- Thank you, sir.

1339
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:16,214
- Proud to have you on our team.
- That's great.

1340
01:39:18,024 --> 01:39:20,424
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

1341
01:39:20,594 --> 01:39:22,323
You threatened to throw her in jail.

1342
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:25,932
Get on your knees and thank her
for solving a crime you couldn't solve.

1343
01:39:26,099 --> 01:39:29,432
- Take your little handshake and put it...
- Okay, Mr. Living-on-the-Edge.

1344
01:39:29,603 --> 01:39:31,764
We're all on the same team.
It's all right.

1345
01:39:31,938 --> 01:39:34,566
Well, I guess he doesn't wanna keep
the press waiting.

1346
01:39:34,941 --> 01:39:37,603
Gracie!

1347
01:39:38,278 --> 01:39:41,714
Oh, you must be getting really tired
of saving my life.

1348
01:39:41,882 --> 01:39:47,445
No, no, it's good exercise.
Oh, and thank you for the "booty" tip.

1349
01:39:48,321 --> 01:39:52,257
I felt so uncomfortable saying it,
but it was an emergency.

1350
01:39:52,426 --> 01:39:57,489
- And I knew you'd be listening.
- Yeah, well, what are friends for, right?

1351
01:39:58,064 --> 01:40:01,693
Oh, and speaking of friends, I would like
to introduce you to Mr. Jeff Foreman.

1352
01:40:01,868 --> 01:40:06,805
Oh, we already met.
He's a wonderful swimmer.

1353
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:09,399
Well, you're so buoyant.

1354
01:40:13,647 --> 01:40:17,606
Okay. Come here.
I gotta talk to you for a second.

1355
01:40:17,784 --> 01:40:19,615
Just a couple words of advice.

1356
01:40:21,521 --> 01:40:24,786
Don't bring up the Poconos,
at least for a couple of months.

1357
01:40:25,792 --> 01:40:27,692
Okay.

1358
01:40:28,895 --> 01:40:30,692
Now go get him.

1359
01:40:31,832 --> 01:40:34,960
Gracie, I'm so proud of you.

1360
01:40:35,135 --> 01:40:36,966
Oh, thank you.

1361
01:40:37,137 --> 01:40:41,870
And, you know, even without the makeup
and the gloss and all my magic...

1362
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:45,068
...you've never looked more beautiful
than you do now.

1363
01:40:45,245 --> 01:40:47,270
Neither have you.

1364
01:40:48,248 --> 01:40:50,648
- Oh, thank you.
- Gracie.

1365
01:40:50,817 --> 01:40:52,717
- Oh, Stan.
- I'm so sorry.

1366
01:40:52,886 --> 01:40:55,446
- It's okay, Stan.
- This was all my fault.

1367
01:40:56,857 --> 01:41:00,156
- I have this weakness for...
- For gambling. I talked to your mother.

1368
01:41:00,327 --> 01:41:01,794
- You talked to my mother?
- Yeah.

1369
01:41:01,962 --> 01:41:05,955
- Does she want her 600 back?
- Yeah, she wants that back.

1370
01:41:06,132 --> 01:41:07,656
But she's very proud of you.

1371
01:41:07,834 --> 01:41:12,203
You just need to stay away from the sluts...
The slots for a little while. Okay? Okay.

1372
01:41:15,442 --> 01:41:17,239
Let's go.

1373
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:22,541
- Over here, sir.
- Why'd you do it?

1374
01:41:28,688 --> 01:41:30,417
How you doing?

1375
01:41:31,324 --> 01:41:33,986
- Good. You?
- Good.

1376
01:41:36,329 --> 01:41:40,925
Hey, you kicked some po-po out there.

1377
01:41:41,635 --> 01:41:45,127
- Thanks. You too.
- Thank you.

1378
01:41:47,741 --> 01:41:51,142
And thanks...

1379
01:41:54,948 --> 01:41:57,382
Thanks for coming back for me.

1380
01:41:58,585 --> 01:42:01,110
- It's not like I love you or anything.
- I know.

1381
01:42:01,288 --> 01:42:03,620
- I was just doing my job.
- I know.

1382
01:42:06,226 --> 01:42:08,126
But I gotta admit...

1383
01:42:09,429 --> 01:42:14,924
...when you were saying that stuff back
there about not having any friends...

1384
01:42:16,002 --> 01:42:17,629
...I know what you mean by that.

1385
01:42:19,205 --> 01:42:21,264
You got a friend.

1386
01:42:22,075 --> 01:42:23,667
Yeah.

1387
01:42:26,246 --> 01:42:29,079
Agent Johnson, over in Mail Fraud?

1388
01:42:29,249 --> 01:42:31,615
I think he likes you.

1389
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:40,718
Yeah.

1390
01:42:44,064 --> 01:42:47,830
No, but if, you know...
If that doesn't work out, then...

1391
01:42:52,572 --> 01:42:54,369
...you always got:

1392
01:43:08,588 --> 01:43:11,318
You know what? She's right down there.
You can talk to her.

1393
01:43:11,491 --> 01:43:12,719
Ms. Hart! Ms. Hart!

1394
01:43:12,892 --> 01:43:15,417
Is this going in your next book?

1395
01:43:15,595 --> 01:43:18,120
Guys, guys. I have two things to say.

1396
01:43:18,298 --> 01:43:22,064
First of all, there's not gonna be
a next book. Second...

1397
01:43:24,437 --> 01:43:27,031
No comment. Ever again. Ever.

1398
01:43:27,207 --> 01:43:31,541
Thank you, thank you.
Not listening. Not listening.

1399
01:43:32,345 --> 01:43:35,109
Mr. Collins, characterize
the investigation for us, sir.

1400
01:43:35,582 --> 01:43:38,847
I never gave up because the word "quit"
is not in my vocabulary.

1401
01:43:39,019 --> 01:43:42,420
Neither is "failure",
"A for effort", "abandon ship"...

1402
01:43:42,956 --> 01:43:45,891
And that is how we do it in New York.

1403
01:43:58,438 --> 01:44:01,032
<i>Okay, listen up. Got a change
in the assignment schedule.</i>

1404
01:44:01,207 --> 01:44:03,266
<i>Hart's gonna be partnering with Fuller.</i>

1405
01:44:03,443 --> 01:44:07,072
And the mayor's youth-crime prevention
program is back on.

1406
01:44:07,247 --> 01:44:10,307
- The director wants...
- You're my new partner.

1407
01:44:10,483 --> 01:44:16,911
You have to like me. And back me up
if someone's shooting at me.

1408
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:19,388
Not necessarily.

1409
01:44:20,026 --> 01:44:23,462
- Want some?
- Let's get to work. Keep your heads up.

1410
01:44:25,265 --> 01:44:28,530
We're partners now, but there's something
I need to take care of alone.

1411
01:44:28,702 --> 01:44:31,899
- Are you sure you don't need backup?
- This is solo.

1412
01:44:32,072 --> 01:44:33,369
- So we cool?
- Cool.

1413
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:34,768
All right, I'm gonna roll.

1414
01:44:57,263 --> 01:44:58,491
Hi.

1415
01:44:59,733 --> 01:45:03,066
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I'm Gracie Hart of the FBI...

1416
01:45:03,236 --> 01:45:08,572
...and our information indicated that
a Priscilla was doing a book report on me...

1417
01:45:08,742 --> 01:45:12,906
...so I thought I would come by
and see if I could be of any assistance.

1418
01:45:13,213 --> 01:45:14,703
Oh, my God.

1419
01:45:14,914 --> 01:45:16,142
Hey, Priscilla.

1420
01:45:16,316 --> 01:45:19,752
Well, I suppose we can skip ahead
to English...

1421
01:45:20,086 --> 01:45:23,886
...and let Priscilla give her report
in honor of our guest.

1422
01:45:24,791 --> 01:45:26,782
Let's put our math books away.

1423
01:45:30,396 --> 01:45:32,728
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

1424
01:45:35,068 --> 01:45:37,263
Since we're in class...

1425
01:45:37,704 --> 01:45:40,605
...I would like to share with you
something I learned recently.

1426
01:45:40,774 --> 01:45:43,299
A little lesson, which is...

1427
01:45:43,910 --> 01:45:47,744
...people may care about people
who care about themselves...

1428
01:45:47,914 --> 01:45:51,077
...but I just don't really care
about those people.

1429
01:45:52,418 --> 01:45:55,581
- Not really following you.
- No?

1430
01:45:56,256 --> 01:45:57,883
Come here.

1431
01:45:58,124 --> 01:46:00,752
We'll just have to take this.

1432
01:46:02,228 --> 01:46:04,628
And then we'll take those.

1433
01:46:04,798 --> 01:46:07,096
And then we'll just...

1434
01:46:10,703 --> 01:46:12,227
There you are.

1435
01:46:13,306 --> 01:46:15,536
Now go do your book report.

1436
01:46:24,417 --> 01:46:27,545
Kids! Quiet!

1437
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,847
Hey, hey, hey,
put a lid on it, all right...

1438
01:46:30,023 --> 01:46:32,856
...or I'm gonna have to rough
you guys up a little bit, okay?

1439
01:46:33,026 --> 01:46:34,254
Miss Hart?

1440
01:46:34,427 --> 01:46:38,830
Until you admit that fighting
is never the answer. Ever.

1441
01:46:38,998 --> 01:46:41,296
Because what do we really want?

1442
01:46:44,137 --> 01:46:45,468
Anyone?

1443
01:46:48,074 --> 01:46:51,475
Nobody? Nobody knows?

1444
01:46:52,712 --> 01:46:54,475
Priscilla, what do we want?

1445
01:46:55,849 --> 01:46:57,476
World peace.

1446
01:46:58,852 --> 01:47:00,217
World peace.

1447
01:47:00,887 --> 01:47:04,482
And the strength
to hold fast to your beliefs...

1448
01:47:04,657 --> 01:47:09,492
...while society's forcing you to conform to
a Barbie-doll image, know what I'm saying?

1449
01:47:09,662 --> 01:47:13,621
You don't know what I'm saying?
Okay, well...

1450
01:47:14,067 --> 01:47:15,762
...it's mostly...

1451
01:47:18,738 --> 01:47:21,070
It's mostly world peace.

1452
01:47:48,134 --> 01:47:51,865
On the video, you noticed the assailants
were attempting to abduct Stan Fields...

1453
01:47:52,038 --> 01:47:56,134
...and you pursued the matter "furder"...
Fur... Okay.

1454
01:47:56,309 --> 01:48:00,541
Some savings bonds and a 1901...

1455
01:48:00,713 --> 01:48:04,809
No, it's not quite that old.
It's a 2001...

1456
01:48:05,051 --> 01:48:06,814
You're the one...

1457
01:48:08,388 --> 01:48:09,946
Damn that line!

1458
01:48:10,123 --> 01:48:12,455
Joel has come up with this very...

1459
01:48:14,694 --> 01:48:15,956
Sedate?

1460
01:48:16,129 --> 01:48:17,721
Yeah, say it, yeah.

1461
01:48:17,897 --> 01:48:19,364
Foreman!

1462
01:48:22,268 --> 01:48:25,795
- Watch it. I'm handling breasts here.
- Yours?

1463
01:48:25,972 --> 01:48:28,463
You pursued the matter furder...
Further...

1464
01:48:29,475 --> 01:48:31,272
- "Furder".
- "Furder"?

1465
01:48:31,444 --> 01:48:35,710
- Not gonna happen.
- What other choice do we have?

1466
01:48:38,117 --> 01:48:41,109
On the kidnapping video,
you noticed that the...

1467
01:48:41,754 --> 01:48:43,847
You know what to say, Jeff.

1468
01:48:45,425 --> 01:48:46,824
- What's your name?
- Foreman.

1469
01:48:46,993 --> 01:48:48,961
Foreman? Okay.

1470
01:48:52,899 --> 01:48:54,491
Fur ball.

1471
01:49:13,686 --> 01:49:17,747
- Little further.
- Back up, back up, back up.

1472
01:49:22,628 --> 01:49:24,858
Feel... I'm upset...

1473
01:49:25,398 --> 01:49:28,367
who are you? What am...?
What am I doing here?

1474
01:49:28,735 --> 01:49:30,362
Stan.

1475
01:49:30,536 --> 01:49:34,495
Don't untie me.
I have another 15 minutes.

1476
01:49:36,642 --> 01:49:39,236
You mentioned something
about breakfast?

1477
01:49:42,448 --> 01:49:45,815
- Unprofessional.
- Still rolling.

1478
01:49:49,622 --> 01:49:53,285
- Oh, my...
- Bro! Your mask!

1479
01:49:53,693 --> 01:49:56,924
We need a bunch of rodents.
Squirrels, wombats.

1480
01:49:57,830 --> 01:50:01,596
- Can I go back to the trailer?
- Yeah, yeah.

1481
01:50:03,269 --> 01:50:09,640
- You like the pirate. You wanna kiss him.
- Shut up!
